okay there's a button there to press the
microphone

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:27.659 align:start position:0%
oh it is okay yeah
 
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 align:start position:0%
it's not my thought was Redmond off
 
00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
Ann Edwards associate attorney general
 
00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 align:start position:0%

General from the Attorney General's

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much for inviting us
 
00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 align:start position:0%
to present I'm going to leave for the
 
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 align:start position:0%
most part this presentation Tim Matt
 
00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 align:start position:0%
we've handed out to you some concerns
 
00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
that we've identified some are from the
 
00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office for the work
 
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 align:start position:0%
that we've been doing particularly in
 
00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 align:start position:0%
um reviewing all of the campaign Finance
 
00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 align:start position:0%
forms for the last three and a half
 
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:10.970 align:start position:0%
forms for the last three and a half
years

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 align:start position:0%
but we also have some combined issues
 
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
with the Secretary of State's office
 
00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 align:start position:0%
they have presented to you earlier in
 
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
the session about those and we have had
 
00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 align:start position:0%
more conversations so we've made some
 
00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 align:start position:0%
modifications and we'd love to chat with
 
00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
you about those so I'll turn it over to
 
00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:26.090 align:start position:0%
you about those so I'll turn it over to
Matt

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 align:start position:0%
Matt
 
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:28.730 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
um

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 align:start position:0%
as attorney Edwards indicated again a
 
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
lot of this does Echo what the secretary
 
00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 align:start position:0%
of state has already presented to you
 
00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 align:start position:0%
folks my understanding is that
 
00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
um attorney Fitch from the Secretary of
 
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
State's office gave you folks a kind of
 
00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 align:start position:0%
a little packet of concerns I have some
 
00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 align:start position:0%
extra copies of that if anyone if anyone
 
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 align:start position:0%
needs it for any reason
 
00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 align:start position:0%
um but uh with that
 
00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
um we'll just kind of go through it here
 
00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 align:start position:0%
if you have any questions please just
 
00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:01.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:20.759 align:start position:0%
so um one of the most frequent issues
 
00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 align:start position:0%
that we see just to leave off at the top
 
00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 align:start position:0%
there is the alphabet alphabetization of
 
00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.590 align:start position:0%
there is the alphabet alphabetization of
donors

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
donors
 
00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539 align:start position:0%
um a lot of reports and filings that we
 
00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 align:start position:0%
see have anywhere between a half dozen
 
00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 align:start position:0%
and a dozen donors and when we we issue
 
00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:40.259 align:start position:0%
people warning letters following up on
 
00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
errors that we've seen they often the
 
00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 align:start position:0%
response is a callback that indicates
 
00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 align:start position:0%
what I need to I need to refile and just
 
00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 align:start position:0%
alphabetize the the half a dozen people
 
00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
that appear on that form
 
00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:56.759 align:start position:0%
um and our response has been well yes
 
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 align:start position:0%
um we would suggest that their that
 
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 align:start position:0%
requirement probably isn't necessary
 
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 align:start position:0%
unless there is a larger number of
 
00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.490 align:start position:0%
unless there is a larger number of
donors

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 align:start position:0%
donors
 
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 align:start position:0%
um so again what number would be
 
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate would of course be up to you
 
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
folks but until it becomes a significant
 
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:17.820 align:start position:0%
number of donors
 
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.340 align:start position:0%
um it's it's probably not necessary to
 
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
have most people who have a small number
 
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 align:start position:0%
of donors
 
00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:26.699 align:start position:0%
um comply or go through that requirement
 
00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:29.629 align:start position:0%
um comply or go through that requirement
so

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:29.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:31.620 align:start position:0%
um so we would consider
 
00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:34.919 align:start position:0%
um a number of maybe 25 or under
 
00:06:38.809 --> 00:06:38.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:39.529 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:39.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:43.259 align:start position:0%
we have a number of issues with late
 
00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:45.900 align:start position:0%
filings and the Secretary of State's
 
00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:48.539 align:start position:0%
office went through this in more detail
 
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
and I don't I don't think it's necessary
 
00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
to go through all of that again
 
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
um but we have a number of
 
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
both different organizations and amounts
 
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:02.220 align:start position:0%
of contributions that trigger different
 
00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:04.620 align:start position:0%
filing and reporting dates
 
00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:07.460 align:start position:0%
we while we have not necessarily
 
00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:09.539 align:start position:0%
explicitly heard that people are
 
00:07:11.809 --> 00:07:11.819 align:start position:0%
confused about that we are
 
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:15.300 align:start position:0%
we are confident that that might be one
 
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
reason why we are seeing a number of
 
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
late filings is people looking at the
 
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:22.740 align:start position:0%
statute and being genuinely confused
 
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
about when exactly it is that they are
 
00:07:27.409 --> 00:07:27.419 align:start position:0%
supposed to be filing
 
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:28.860 align:start position:0%
um with the state so we think that
 
00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:32.220 align:start position:0%
simplifying that scheme of who is
 
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:35.580 align:start position:0%
required to register report and file
 
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:39.300 align:start position:0%
when would probably alleviate many of
 
00:07:43.309 --> 00:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
the late filings that we are seeing
 
00:07:43.319 --> 00:07:43.990 align:start position:0%
the late filings that we are seeing
um

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:47.809 --> 00:07:47.819 align:start position:0%
reporting dovetailing off of that a
 
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
um reporting versus registering
 
00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:54.300 align:start position:0%
so uh we have been looking at a scheme
 
00:07:57.409 --> 00:07:57.419 align:start position:0%
where uh folks
 
00:08:01.309 --> 00:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
not everyone who registers with the
 
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:04.620 align:start position:0%
state's campaign Finance reporting
 
00:08:09.249 --> 00:08:09.259 align:start position:0%
website has to report and vice versa
 
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:13.740 align:start position:0%
so we would suggest that having all
 
00:08:16.129 --> 00:08:16.139 align:start position:0%
entities that participate in this
 
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:19.800 align:start position:0%
process have to at least register with
 
00:08:21.129 --> 00:08:21.139 align:start position:0%
the site
 
00:08:25.369 --> 00:08:25.379 align:start position:0%
that would we think simplify some
 
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
confusion there by just creating the
 
00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
across-the-board requirement that folks
 
00:08:32.769 --> 00:08:32.779 align:start position:0%
sign up with the site when they begin
 
00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
the process when the campaign season
 
00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.269 align:start position:0%
the process when the campaign season
starts

00:08:38.269 --> 00:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:40.919 align:start position:0%
and before we move on from that point so
 
00:08:44.029 --> 00:08:44.039 align:start position:0%
part of what we do is we enforce the
 
00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:46.740 align:start position:0%
election laws and if we use an example
 
00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
of political mailers
 
00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:51.320 align:start position:0%
those flyers come in the mail to people
 
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
they sometimes now they come over social
 
00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
media as well when those documents come
 
00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
out the
 
00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:03.720 align:start position:0%
what happens is depending on how they
 
00:09:05.389 --> 00:09:05.399 align:start position:0%
have them printed and how they have them
 
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
mailed they can keep the organization
 
00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:11.100 align:start position:0%
that does that can stay under the limit
 
00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:13.500 align:start position:0%
so if they're one of the political
 
00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
committees that doesn't have to report
 
00:09:17.829 --> 00:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
until they expend 2500
 
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
and they do a mailer that runs for
 
00:09:23.449 --> 00:09:23.459 align:start position:0%
fifteen hundred dollars they don't have
 
00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:26.700 align:start position:0%
to report on that they often
 
00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest challenges we've had
 
00:09:31.009 --> 00:09:31.019 align:start position:0%
in the last election cycle is people
 
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
don't properly identify who is putting
 
00:09:36.949 --> 00:09:36.959 align:start position:0%
out the mailer so even if they don't
 
00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
have to report the expenditure under
 
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:43.260 align:start position:0%
66417 they still have to put their
 
00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:45.720 align:start position:0%
identification on the mailer so that
 
00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:48.300 align:start position:0%
people know who has put that mailer out
 
00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:51.740 align:start position:0%
and so we then spend a lot of time
 
00:09:56.329 --> 00:09:56.339 align:start position:0%
trying to track down people and people
 
00:09:59.329 --> 00:09:59.339 align:start position:0%
organizations and it's a challenge to do
 
00:10:00.889 --> 00:10:00.899 align:start position:0%
that and you're trying to do it as
 
00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:02.700 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible because a lot of
 
00:10:05.329 --> 00:10:05.339 align:start position:0%
time we call them Anonymous mailers
 
00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:07.380 align:start position:0%
these Anonymous mailers come out two
 
00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
weeks before an election and people are
 
00:10:12.769 --> 00:10:12.779 align:start position:0%
very upset in the community about what's
 
00:10:14.329 --> 00:10:14.339 align:start position:0%
being said in it and they want to
 
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
understand whether it's an accurate
 
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
mailer or an inaccurate mailer so they
 
00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:21.540 align:start position:0%
want to know who's sending it so if all
 
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:23.700 align:start position:0%
political committees had to register
 
00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
even if they don't have to report it
 
00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:28.860 align:start position:0%
would make things much easier in the
 
00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:30.660 align:start position:0%
enforcement side of it now we understand
 
00:10:32.449 --> 00:10:32.459 align:start position:0%
there could be reasons why people might
 
00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:34.980 align:start position:0%
not want that to happen but that from
 
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
our perspective as the enforcement
 
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:45.300 align:start position:0%
um so the next item there
 
00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:47.820 align:start position:0%
um one thing that we are seeing a great
 
00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
deal and a lot of people they genuinely
 
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
don't seem to understand that it's a
 
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
requirement is a person or a committee's
 
00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
filings tend to stop when a campaign or
 
00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:04.260 align:start position:0%
a candidacy ends they they don't seem to
 
00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:05.940 align:start position:0%
actually be aware of the requirement
 
00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
that if there is outstanding debt
 
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
outstanding obligations or an
 
00:11:12.829 --> 00:11:12.839 align:start position:0%
outstanding Surplus that they have to
 
00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:17.160 align:start position:0%
continue to report until that Surplus or
 
00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:20.420 align:start position:0%
debt has been satisfied
 
00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:23.220 align:start position:0%
a clear statement of the law on that
 
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
could help to alleviate that but we did
 
00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:28.140 align:start position:0%
want to bring it to this body's
 
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
attention that that is something that
 
00:11:32.569 --> 00:11:32.579 align:start position:0%
we're seeing a great deal that it it and
 
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
it makes a little bit of sense it's kind
 
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
of common sense that oh well wait a
 
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
minute but I'm not in the game anymore
 
00:11:41.569 --> 00:11:41.579 align:start position:0%
so why would I continue to report
 
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
um just some action being taken to kind
 
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
of educate a little bit more and to make
 
00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:51.300 align:start position:0%
it clear that no no that obligation does
 
00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:54.660 align:start position:0%
continue to exist beyond the candidacy
 
00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
or the campaign
 
00:11:58.970 --> 00:11:58.980 align:start position:0%
um could could alleviate some issues
 
00:12:02.329 --> 00:12:02.339 align:start position:0%
that that we are seeing and Reporting
 
00:12:05.509 --> 00:12:05.519 align:start position:0%
um item e under there
 
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
um so it's another thing that we don't
 
00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:12.060 align:start position:0%
neces on this point we don't necessarily
 
00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:13.740 align:start position:0%
have a recommendation but it was
 
00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
something that we wanted to bring to
 
00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:17.640 align:start position:0%
this body's attention was that we are
 
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
seeing a number of un itemized receipts
 
00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:24.060 align:start position:0%
that are under the threshold the
 
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:27.320 align:start position:0%
triggering threshold of fifty dollars on
 
00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
many reports that are totaling up into
 
00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:35.420 align:start position:0%
values of many not many but several
 
00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:37.740 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars with many of those
 
00:12:41.569 --> 00:12:41.579 align:start position:0%
amounts being under 25
 
00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
um so again this it's looking like if we
 
00:12:49.129 --> 00:12:49.139 align:start position:0%
had to speculate uh fundraising
 
00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:52.200 align:start position:0%
instances where people are just giving a
 
00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
few dollars at a time but that is
 
00:12:58.250 --> 00:12:58.260 align:start position:0%
totaling up to amounts on these reports
 
00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:01.260 align:start position:0%
in the thousands of dollars
 
00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:03.720 align:start position:0%
and again just to raise another Point
 
00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:04.850 align:start position:0%
and again just to raise another Point
here

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:04.860 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:13:08.509 --> 00:13:08.519 align:start position:0%
there's nothing unlawful about this at
 
00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
all one of the challenges though under
 
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
664 colon six Roman one is that if an
 
00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
individual donor donor makes
 
00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
contributions that in the aggregate
 
00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:22.860 align:start position:0%
exceed 200 then those have to be totaled
 
00:13:24.889 --> 00:13:24.899 align:start position:0%
so when you have a lot of small
 
00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:27.180 align:start position:0%
donations that are made and perhaps are
 
00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:30.540 align:start position:0%
made at different events it's it's just
 
00:13:32.509 --> 00:13:32.519 align:start position:0%
so that the legislature understands it's
 
00:13:34.129 --> 00:13:34.139 align:start position:0%
virtually impossible for the Attorney
 
00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
General's office to determine whether or
 
00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
not there is there are aggregate
 
00:13:41.389 --> 00:13:41.399 align:start position:0%
contributions of 200 or more
 
00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:44.220 align:start position:0%
Connie I'm sorry representative that's
 
00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:46.740 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you
 
00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:49.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
are those are do you know what kind of
 
00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:56.100 align:start position:0%
races those are are those perhaps more
 
00:13:58.610 --> 00:13:58.620 align:start position:0%
House of Representative races or they
 
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
usually going to go up the chain to the
 
00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:03.300 align:start position:0%
larger races
 
00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:04.490 align:start position:0%
larger races
so

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:04.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
um I spoke to the member of our team who
 
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh who actually brought that item to our
 
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
attention I do not have the breakdown of
 
00:14:14.329 --> 00:14:14.339 align:start position:0%
what that is I could try to get that
 
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
data for you
 
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:21.590 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:24.829 --> 00:14:24.839 align:start position:0%
the the next point there this is a
 
00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
a practical one that we're seeing is
 
00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:29.940 align:start position:0%
arithmetic and handwriting
 
00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:33.660 align:start position:0%
um there's been a significant amount of
 
00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
our enforcement attention spent on just
 
00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
trying to discern what what is being
 
00:14:42.889 --> 00:14:42.899 align:start position:0%
written on a paper and double checking
 
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
people's arithmetic on the reports that
 
00:14:47.569 --> 00:14:47.579 align:start position:0%
they have filed
 
00:14:47.579 --> 00:14:48.170 align:start position:0%
they have filed
um

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:48.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's a
 
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
a it's a it's a process um I will say
 
00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.069 align:start position:0%
a it's a it's a process um I will say
that

00:14:55.069 --> 00:14:55.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
um the only thing that we could
 
00:15:02.329 --> 00:15:02.339 align:start position:0%
um offer there is if there was a scheme
 
00:15:03.889 --> 00:15:03.899 align:start position:0%
where we had
 
00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
um more finding Authority for inaccurate
 
00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:09.320 align:start position:0%
reports illegible
 
00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:13.380 align:start position:0%
reports for uh repeat offenders for
 
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
example that could help us to to make it
 
00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:19.500 align:start position:0%
clear that we need people to be filing
 
00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
those reports accurately legibly so that
 
00:15:25.509 --> 00:15:25.519 align:start position:0%
we can do our job efficiently
 
00:15:29.329 --> 00:15:29.339 align:start position:0%
and make it make it clear that those
 
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
reports need need to be clear if they're
 
00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:33.300 align:start position:0%
being filed
 
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
sorry I thought we had a question there
 
00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:37.980 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh
 
00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
similar to the question representative
 
00:15:43.009 --> 00:15:43.019 align:start position:0%
Lane just asked I'm not looking for data
 
00:15:44.569 --> 00:15:44.579 align:start position:0%
here but do you have a feel for what
 
00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:46.260 align:start position:0%
percentage of the reports have
 
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
legibility or accuracy difficulties just
 
00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:51.660 align:start position:0%
an idea
 
00:15:53.569 --> 00:15:53.579 align:start position:0%
I know it's obviously it sounds like
 
00:15:54.889 --> 00:15:54.899 align:start position:0%
enough work that you're concerned about
 
00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
it but five percent ten percent
 
00:16:00.129 --> 00:16:00.139 align:start position:0%
just just a
 
00:16:02.689 --> 00:16:02.699 align:start position:0%
to Ballpark it would probably be about
 
00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
10 or 15 but again that's not a hard
 
00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:06.660 align:start position:0%
number that's what I'm looking for and
 
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
it's not going to come back to haunt you
 
00:16:17.569 --> 00:16:17.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
um how many man hours would you say go
 
00:16:23.829 --> 00:16:23.839 align:start position:0%
into your Democrat
 
00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
how many attorney person hours
 
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
um would you say go into I appreciate
 
00:16:31.009 --> 00:16:31.019 align:start position:0%
that would go into
 
00:16:32.629 --> 00:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
um as you can tell I'm not awake yet so
 
00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:34.260 align:start position:0%
that one like
 
00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:35.150 align:start position:0%
that one like
um

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
uh would go into deciphering these um
 
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
Egyptian hieroglyphics that are
 
00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:43.620 align:start position:0%
sometimes on these reports
 
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
um so there is
 
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
um a there are two pieces to it there
 
00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.249 align:start position:0%
um a there are two pieces to it there
was

00:16:49.249 --> 00:16:49.259 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:52.380 align:start position:0%
um the hours spent probably
 
00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:54.230 align:start position:0%
um the hours spent probably
um

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:57.180 align:start position:0%
probably a few dozen hours spent
 
00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:00.420 align:start position:0%
determining what the schemes were going
 
00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:03.180 align:start position:0%
to be for uh
 
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
are warning letters and replying to
 
00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
these folks that was probably a a couple
 
00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:09.900 align:start position:0%
dozen hours with a couple members of our
 
00:17:12.409 --> 00:17:12.419 align:start position:0%
team in the beginning in terms of the
 
00:17:12.419 --> 00:17:14.110 align:start position:0%
team in the beginning in terms of the
ongoing

00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:14.120 align:start position:0%
ongoing
 
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
processing of these and going through
 
00:17:19.549 --> 00:17:19.559 align:start position:0%
them and Discerning
 
00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:21.540 align:start position:0%
um were
 
00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:39.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
um and one one point that I'll clarify
 
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
is that there is
 
00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:45.660 align:start position:0%
um on as an ongoing matter we have a
 
00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:47.820 align:start position:0%
paralegal who goes through these she's
 
00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:50.940 align:start position:0%
the point person on Discerning these on
 
00:17:54.409 --> 00:17:54.419 align:start position:0%
an ongoing basis it's probably been well
 
00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
over a hundred hours
 
00:17:59.630 --> 00:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
um dedicated to to Discerning
 
00:18:02.029 --> 00:18:02.039 align:start position:0%
um arithmetic issues and eligibility
 
00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:06.660 align:start position:0%
issues and if I could hop in so we've
 
00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
been doing this for a long time and what
 
00:18:13.789 --> 00:18:13.799 align:start position:0%
we realize is that some candidates just
 
00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:17.160 align:start position:0%
don't are not computer savvy and they're
 
00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:19.340 align:start position:0%
not using computers
 
00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:23.160 align:start position:0%
as a result some won't use the online
 
00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:26.820 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance system
 
00:18:29.529 --> 00:18:29.539 align:start position:0%
that system also had some challenges
 
00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:32.720 align:start position:0%
relatively recently and so that caused
 
00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps an influx of more written
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
reports but we do have certain
 
00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:41.820 align:start position:0%
individuals who have filed over the
 
00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
years and have been
 
00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:46.860 align:start position:0%
notified over the years that they are
 
00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:50.220 align:start position:0%
filing with Mac errors and illegible
 
00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:52.620 align:start position:0%
language and they continue to file that
 
00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:55.860 align:start position:0%
way so for some individuals I believe
 
00:19:00.409 --> 00:19:00.419 align:start position:0%
that it's a tactic for how to
 
00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:10.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:12.289 --> 00:19:12.299 align:start position:0%
yeah you don't get to do that when you
 
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
sit in the big seat you know
 
00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.250 align:start position:0%
sit in the big seat you know
um

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:16.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:20.120 align:start position:0%
so it's safe to say it's 150 hours
 
00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
once again I'm not going to sit there
 
00:19:24.409 --> 00:19:24.419 align:start position:0%
and demand an audit log right
 
00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:26.940 align:start position:0%
um probably paying a paralegal probably
 
00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:29.660 align:start position:0%
all in around 25 plus
 
00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:31.980 align:start position:0%
probably more well I've heard the States
 
00:19:35.049 --> 00:19:35.059 align:start position:0%
you know it's probably more public so
 
00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
fully fully burdened probably more like
 
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
50 or more yeah total comp probably 50
 
00:19:42.409 --> 00:19:42.419 align:start position:0%
so I can't get someone to rake my lawn
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
for 25 yeah well you know when you live
 
00:19:46.669 --> 00:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
with the beautiful people in Hanover I
 
00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
understand but
 
00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:50.700 align:start position:0%
for the for those of us regular folks
 
00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:52.760 align:start position:0%
all right okay two so it's costing us
 
00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
thirty five hundred dollars at least in
 
00:19:57.950 --> 00:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
man hours at a minimum
 
00:19:59.930 --> 00:19:59.940 align:start position:0%
that's probably bad math am I missing a
 
00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:01.130 align:start position:0%
that's probably bad math am I missing a
zero

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:01.140 align:start position:0%
zero
 
00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:02.690 align:start position:0%
zero
um

00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:02.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:04.140 align:start position:0%
it's costing us a lot of money to do
 
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
this because we just won't file online
 
00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:07.850 align:start position:0%
this because we just won't file online
yes

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:07.860 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:09.780 align:start position:0%
it's a challenge and I know that the
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office with
 
00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:13.380 align:start position:0%
conversations we've had recently
 
00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
is working on plans for how individuals
 
00:20:19.549 --> 00:20:19.559 align:start position:0%
can come to the Secretary of State's
 
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
office and be able to have access to a
 
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
computer for folks who don't have access
 
00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:26.220 align:start position:0%
to a computer and there will be
 
00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:28.380 align:start position:0%
individuals there who could also answer
 
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
questions for them to help them be able
 
00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:36.289 --> 00:20:36.299 align:start position:0%
so yeah well wouldn't it be cheaper to
 
00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:37.860 align:start position:0%
save 300 bucks and just give the
 
00:20:39.289 --> 00:20:39.299 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office a thousand
 
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
dollars set up a desktop people can use
 
00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:43.500 align:start position:0%
like wouldn't that be cheaper and faster
 
00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:46.700 align:start position:0%
and fix everything
 
00:20:49.789 --> 00:20:49.799 align:start position:0%
I guess it's like a rhetorical question
 
00:20:51.289 --> 00:20:51.299 align:start position:0%
can we get a thousand dollars to get the
 
00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State a a uh it doesn't
 
00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:55.740 align:start position:0%
even need to be a good laptop most
 
00:20:57.710 --> 00:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
people who testify in front of this work
 
00:20:59.090 --> 00:20:59.100 align:start position:0%
group eventually learn they don't have
 
00:21:00.409 --> 00:21:00.419 align:start position:0%
to answer representative various
 
00:21:00.419 --> 00:21:02.210 align:start position:0%
to answer representative various
questions

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:02.220 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:03.780 align:start position:0%
just just thinking out loud here it's
 
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
like you know if you need a if you need
 
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
a Macbook or something
 
00:21:10.909 --> 00:21:10.919 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't resolve
 
00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:12.780 align:start position:0%
completely resolve the difficulty for
 
00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
people who live up like in the North End
 
00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:17.100 align:start position:0%
of the state
 
00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:19.740 align:start position:0%
because of travel time too are they
 
00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
getting over a thousand dollars in
 
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.789 align:start position:0%
getting over a thousand dollars in
contributions

00:21:22.789 --> 00:21:22.799 align:start position:0%
contributions
 
00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:24.660 align:start position:0%
I doubt it well I don't know the answer
 
00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
to that but I'm just so yeah
 
00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking if we uh as has been
 
00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
discussed in the subcommittee meeting if
 
00:21:31.679 --> 00:21:32.810 align:start position:0%
discussed in the subcommittee meeting if
we

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:32.820 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:21:35.029 --> 00:21:35.039 align:start position:0%
worked on having a mandatory requirement
 
00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:38.820 align:start position:0%
to use the online system
 
00:21:41.029 --> 00:21:41.039 align:start position:0%
I think we'd have to make a reasonable
 
00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:43.740 align:start position:0%
accommodation for people who were not
 
00:21:46.789 --> 00:21:46.799 align:start position:0%
don't have the skills or the equipment
 
00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
to do it online that's and I don't know
 
00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:50.460 align:start position:0%
what that reasonable accommodation would
 
00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
be at this point
 
00:21:54.049 --> 00:21:54.059 align:start position:0%
I've had to take into account the entire
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
length of time it takes to get to a
 
00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
place where they could use a computer it
 
00:21:59.330 --> 00:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
seems to me
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
I think yeah the Secretary of State
 
00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:02.940 align:start position:0%
could could work with local libraries to
 
00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:04.250 align:start position:0%
could could work with local libraries to
give

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:04.260 align:start position:0%
give
 
00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
um candidates especially for the house
 
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
who are all over may not have fancy
 
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
computers in their houses access
 
00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:14.810 align:start position:0%
computers in their houses access
yes

00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:14.820 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:22:17.029 --> 00:22:17.039 align:start position:0%
the kind of thing you know the ones that
 
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:23.220 align:start position:0%
well I think we could develop a solution
 
00:22:25.789 --> 00:22:25.799 align:start position:0%
I mean that's an example of of an idea
 
00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:28.020 align:start position:0%
that you know in the face of it sounds
 
00:22:30.529 --> 00:22:30.539 align:start position:0%
useful thank you representative
 
00:22:30.539 --> 00:22:33.710 align:start position:0%
useful thank you representative
mirrorhead

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:37.140 align:start position:0%
and thank you uh representative Mary so
 
00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:40.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:42.900 align:start position:0%
and yet he somehow survived with the
 
00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:47.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:49.549 --> 00:22:49.559 align:start position:0%
yes we can
 
00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:50.820 align:start position:0%
do you have a comment or a question
 
00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:53.220 align:start position:0%
representative Blaine do you have a
 
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
comment or a question you'd like to
 
00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:56.700 align:start position:0%
share with us yes could we please move
 
00:22:58.909 --> 00:22:58.919 align:start position:0%
on to the testimony in front of us yes
 
00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:02.100 align:start position:0%
so the one thing we'd like to add with
 
00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
respect to the finding Authority is that
 
00:23:09.049 --> 00:23:09.059 align:start position:0%
we have authority to find political
 
00:23:12.169 --> 00:23:12.179 align:start position:0%
committees for late filings
 
00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
but we don't have the authority to find
 
00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:17.820 align:start position:0%
political committees for
 
00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:19.810 align:start position:0%
political committees for
illegible

00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:19.820 align:start position:0%
illegible
 
00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:23.700 align:start position:0%
filings or incorrectly added filings and
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
things like that and I I would hope that
 
00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
I would offer that in the 26 years that
 
00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
I've been at the Attorney General's
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
office we do not run rampant with
 
00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:34.980 align:start position:0%
finding Authority so this isn't
 
00:23:38.049 --> 00:23:38.059 align:start position:0%
something where we're looking to find
 
00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:41.220 align:start position:0%
individuals or political committees but
 
00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:45.780 align:start position:0%
it's helpful to have that as a deterrent
 
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
in place because we what we often have
 
00:23:49.909 --> 00:23:49.919 align:start position:0%
is we have the ability to charge someone
 
00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:52.140 align:start position:0%
with a misdemeanor and the chances of us
 
00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:53.820 align:start position:0%
charging someone with a misdemeanor
 
00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:55.860 align:start position:0%
because they're writing eligibly on a
 
00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:03.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:07.620 align:start position:0%
so those were the issues that we wanted
 
00:24:09.289 --> 00:24:09.299 align:start position:0%
to bring to this body's attention
 
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
regarding things that we directly are
 
00:24:14.029 --> 00:24:14.039 align:start position:0%
seeing on reports common problems that
 
00:24:15.649 --> 00:24:15.659 align:start position:0%
we're seeing
 
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
um I'll also move on or rather I'll move
 
00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
on here to issues that we have talked
 
00:24:22.909 --> 00:24:22.919 align:start position:0%
with the Secretary of State about and
 
00:24:25.549 --> 00:24:25.559 align:start position:0%
there's there's some common ground on
 
00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:28.020 align:start position:0%
how how we would address or how we
 
00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:29.580 align:start position:0%
believe those issues should be addressed
 
00:24:33.169 --> 00:24:33.179 align:start position:0%
and we have some common thoughts on them
 
00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
um the Secretary of State's office has
 
00:24:38.149 --> 00:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
already distinguished it to this body
 
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
that there are currently nine different
 
00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:43.140 align:start position:0%
types of registrants I won't go through
 
00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:44.280 align:start position:0%
that again I don't think that's a good
 
00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:47.100 align:start position:0%
use of anybody's time here but the one
 
00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919 align:start position:0%
that we did want to note
 
00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:51.720 align:start position:0%
um and the one that we have had real
 
00:24:54.529 --> 00:24:54.539 align:start position:0%
conversations on is
 
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
um political committees versus political
 
00:24:59.270 --> 00:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
committees that have an election or that
 
00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:02.340 align:start position:0%
have electioneering as a major purpose
 
00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:05.220 align:start position:0%
um after our review of the law and have
 
00:25:07.549 --> 00:25:07.559 align:start position:0%
included the
 
00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
the the sections of RSA 664 colon 2 that
 
00:25:17.289 --> 00:25:17.299 align:start position:0%
um lay those organizations out
 
00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:22.020 align:start position:0%
there is little meaningful difference
 
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
um between when
 
00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:25.630 align:start position:0%
um between when
the

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:25.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:25:28.669 --> 00:25:28.679 align:start position:0%
characteristics that define both of
 
00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:31.020 align:start position:0%
those types of organizations and so we
 
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
have we are now considering them uh one
 
00:25:36.409 --> 00:25:36.419 align:start position:0%
and the same we're looking primarily at
 
00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
the two thousand five hundred dollar
 
00:25:38.159 --> 00:25:40.190 align:start position:0%
the two thousand five hundred dollar
threshold

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
threshold
 
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
um in defining those organizations there
 
00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
um so again there's there is this
 
00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:50.460 align:start position:0%
this blurring of
 
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
um what those organizations are and
 
00:25:55.549 --> 00:25:55.559 align:start position:0%
again that does kind of feed into
 
00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
um concerns that the secretary of state
 
00:25:58.430 --> 00:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
has already raised regarding the
 
00:26:00.169 --> 00:26:00.179 align:start position:0%
complexity of the different types of
 
00:26:03.049 --> 00:26:03.059 align:start position:0%
organizations which in turn can go back
 
00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
to other issues such as when different
 
00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
organizations meeting different
 
00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
thresholds have different reporting
 
00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:12.110 align:start position:0%
thresholds have different reporting
deadlines

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
deadlines
 
00:26:15.649 --> 00:26:15.659 align:start position:0%
um and amounts excuse me
 
00:26:15.659 --> 00:26:16.669 align:start position:0%
um and amounts excuse me
um

00:26:16.669 --> 00:26:16.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0%
there is some language in RSA 664 of a
 
00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:26.360 align:start position:0%
candidate versus a candidate committee
 
00:26:28.909 --> 00:26:28.919 align:start position:0%
to expand on that thought a little bit
 
00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
more and again the secretary of state
 
00:26:33.529 --> 00:26:33.539 align:start position:0%
does that in their handout I won't go
 
00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
through it exhaustively
 
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
there are sections that denote the
 
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of candidates
 
00:26:45.289 --> 00:26:45.299 align:start position:0%
the responsibilities of candidate
 
00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
committees and then it breaks down the
 
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of financial agents
 
00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.269 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of financial agents
treasurers

00:26:52.269 --> 00:26:52.279 align:start position:0%
treasurers
 
00:26:56.409 --> 00:26:56.419 align:start position:0%
but also seems to use the word candidate
 
00:26:58.730 --> 00:26:58.740 align:start position:0%
interchangeably with some of those
 
00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:01.380 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and some of those terms
 
00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
and so it may be worth looking at the
 
00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:10.620 align:start position:0%
sections that of RSA 664 that the
 
00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
secretary of state has raised to see if
 
00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:15.740 align:start position:0%
if that language can be unified
 
00:27:20.029 --> 00:27:20.039 align:start position:0%
to make it clear that this is that a
 
00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:23.720 align:start position:0%
candidate would or a candidate or a
 
00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:26.460 align:start position:0%
financial agent whatever term the
 
00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
legislature uses or chooses rather could
 
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
be used in all of those instances to to
 
00:27:36.409 --> 00:27:36.419 align:start position:0%
clear up any ambiguity there
 
00:27:36.419 --> 00:27:38.149 align:start position:0%
clear up any ambiguity there
um

00:27:38.149 --> 00:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
or there are
 
00:27:43.669 --> 00:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
um some organizations 501cs in
 
00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
particular that are not required under
 
00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:49.380 align:start position:0%
the law to disclose the identities of
 
00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:51.720 align:start position:0%
their contributors they fall into the
 
00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:55.140 align:start position:0%
requirements of uh disclosure amounts
 
00:27:57.769 --> 00:27:57.779 align:start position:0%
Etc but they're explicitly not required
 
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
to disclose the identities of who is
 
00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:02.820 align:start position:0%
contributing to them
 
00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:05.580 align:start position:0%
um again nothing nothing unlawful being
 
00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:07.740 align:start position:0%
raised before this body we just want to
 
00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:10.260 align:start position:0%
point out that that is that is how we
 
00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
and the Secretary of State are reading
 
00:28:15.649 --> 00:28:15.659 align:start position:0%
the law and if there is something there
 
00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
that this body would like to revisit
 
00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:18.470 align:start position:0%
that this body would like to revisit
then

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
that's that is entirely
 
00:28:22.789 --> 00:28:22.799 align:start position:0%
um up to your discretion but again just
 
00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
something that we wanted to raise in
 
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
terms of how it is that we're reading
 
00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
the law
 
00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:31.260 align:start position:0%
and if I could just add so one of the
 
00:28:35.029 --> 00:28:35.039 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons behind campaign
 
00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:38.340 align:start position:0%
Finance reports is so that similar to
 
00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:40.260 align:start position:0%
the example that we gave earlier on the
 
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
political mailers is so that if somebody
 
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
wants to go search through the reports
 
00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:46.620 align:start position:0%
they can determine
 
00:28:48.769 --> 00:28:48.779 align:start position:0%
who is contributing to different
 
00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
candidates or in support or opposed to
 
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
different measures on the ballot and
 
00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:57.240 align:start position:0%
they can access that information
 
00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:00.360 align:start position:0%
people will
 
00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
complain to us when they are not happy
 
00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
with the disclosure information and they
 
00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
feel like they can't determine who is
 
00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:13.740 align:start position:0%
funding an effort to support or defeat a
 
00:29:16.549 --> 00:29:16.559 align:start position:0%
candidate and so we raise this issue
 
00:29:18.889 --> 00:29:18.899 align:start position:0%
because this is what the law says this
 
00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
is how the law is enforced but just so
 
00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:23.460 align:start position:0%
that you're aware of the fact that this
 
00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:26.340 align:start position:0%
is one of the areas that we sometimes
 
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
receive complaints and when I say
 
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's not a huge number of
 
00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
complaints but people do complain to us
 
00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:34.860 align:start position:0%
at different times that they find it
 
00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
frustrating that they can't figure out
 
00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:38.220 align:start position:0%
who is contributing to certain
 
00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:44.269 align:start position:0%
who is contributing to certain
organizations

00:29:44.269 --> 00:29:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:44.279 --> 00:29:46.130 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:46.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
under 664 the definition of political
 
00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:50.940 align:start position:0%
advertising continues to include the
 
00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
word implicitly
 
00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:56.460 align:start position:0%
um we there are two concerns there one
 
00:29:59.930 --> 00:29:59.940 align:start position:0%
um for the uninitiated in um campaign
 
00:30:02.029 --> 00:30:02.039 align:start position:0%
Finance law and campaign election law
 
00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
that could be confusing that a word
 
00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:05.940 align:start position:0%
continues to appear in the statute that
 
00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:08.820 align:start position:0%
has been declared unconstitutional as a
 
00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:11.820 align:start position:0%
practical concern from our perspective
 
00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
we have made it our practice to whenever
 
00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:17.700 align:start position:0%
we issue any kind of a warning letter a
 
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
cease and desist letter we take whenever
 
00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:21.240 align:start position:0%
we take any kind of action on political
 
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
advertising and we walk through the
 
00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:26.340 align:start position:0%
legal analysis including what is
 
00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
political advertising we always have to
 
00:30:31.269 --> 00:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
include a disclaimer that that
 
00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:34.200 align:start position:0%
implicitly language is no longer the law
 
00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:36.360 align:start position:0%
of the land and we walk through the case
 
00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
law there to explain to these folks that
 
00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:44.340 align:start position:0%
that word no longer is applicable so we
 
00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:46.140 align:start position:0%
think there would be some value in in
 
00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:49.020 align:start position:0%
just having that word removed from the
 
00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:52.190 align:start position:0%
just having that word removed from the
statute

00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:53.149 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:30:53.149 --> 00:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
uh political advocacy organization
 
00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:57.490 align:start position:0%
uh political advocacy organization
um

00:30:57.490 --> 00:30:57.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:59.529 align:start position:0%
um
we

00:30:59.529 --> 00:30:59.539 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:02.940 align:start position:0%
we've found that this raised an
 
00:31:05.090 --> 00:31:05.100 align:start position:0%
interesting point of interpretation
 
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
because it the these organizations
 
00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
trigger the
 
00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
um need to
 
00:31:18.769 --> 00:31:18.779 align:start position:0%
file with the state when they spend two
 
00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
thousand five hundred dollars on
 
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.149 align:start position:0%
thousand five hundred dollars on
Communications

00:31:23.149 --> 00:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
Communications
 
00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
um this raises a a little bit of an
 
00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:29.340 align:start position:0%
interesting disconnect where we're
 
00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:31.149 align:start position:0%
interesting disconnect where we're
wondering

00:31:31.149 --> 00:31:31.159 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
we're making the determination of what
 
00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:37.860 align:start position:0%
constitutes a communication
 
00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:40.860 align:start position:0%
um what constitutes a payment for a
 
00:31:42.649 --> 00:31:42.659 align:start position:0%
communication for example if a payment
 
00:31:48.049 --> 00:31:48.059 align:start position:0%
is made but not given with the explicit
 
00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
purpose of a communication that's it's
 
00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:53.460 align:start position:0%
not labeled or for lack of a better word
 
00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:55.140 align:start position:0%
earmarked for the purpose of
 
00:31:57.710 --> 00:31:57.720 align:start position:0%
communication but it is subsequently
 
00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
used for communication is that something
 
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
that that organization needs to report
 
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
um versus not
 
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
we think that
 
00:32:11.389 --> 00:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
clarifying that language could be could
 
00:32:14.269 --> 00:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
be helpful to folks that are going to
 
00:32:16.909 --> 00:32:16.919 align:start position:0%
fall into that
 
00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
um the category of a political advocacy
 
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
organization there did you want to add
 
00:32:24.769 --> 00:32:24.779 align:start position:0%
anything okay
 
00:32:24.779 --> 00:32:26.990 align:start position:0%
anything okay
um

00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
we wanted to briefly address HB
 
00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
um 195.
 
00:32:39.169 --> 00:32:39.179 align:start position:0%
um to raise the point that the the bill
 
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
does not
 
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
substantially change the definition of
 
00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
um what a political advocacy
 
00:32:49.909 --> 00:32:49.919 align:start position:0%
organization is
 
00:32:54.169 --> 00:32:54.179 align:start position:0%
um and so we wanted to raise the
 
00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
question of what
 
00:33:01.549 --> 00:33:01.559 align:start position:0%
what the this body is aiming to achieve
 
00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
with that and
 
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
um what what
 
00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:10.380 align:start position:0%
goal is being sought with changing that
 
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
definition because we did not believe
 
00:33:15.169 --> 00:33:15.179 align:start position:0%
that after looking at that looking at
 
00:33:19.009 --> 00:33:19.019 align:start position:0%
the other definitions under 664
 
00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
um two and one of what constitutes an
 
00:33:24.409 --> 00:33:24.419 align:start position:0%
organization that there was not a
 
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
substantial shift there in in what
 
00:33:30.529 --> 00:33:30.539 align:start position:0%
constituted a um a political advocacy
 
00:33:30.539 --> 00:33:32.810 align:start position:0%
constituted a um a political advocacy
organization

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:32.820 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:33.590 align:start position:0%
organization
um

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:36.649 --> 00:33:36.659 align:start position:0%
there is a requirement for a written
 
00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:40.380 align:start position:0%
consent on receipt of contributions we
 
00:33:42.289 --> 00:33:42.299 align:start position:0%
just wanted to raise with his body that
 
00:33:44.269 --> 00:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
we and it appears that the secretary of
 
00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:47.240 align:start position:0%
state is in the same place we have not
 
00:33:51.289 --> 00:33:51.299 align:start position:0%
heard of anybody complying with that
 
00:33:51.299 --> 00:33:52.730 align:start position:0%
heard of anybody complying with that
requirement

00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:52.740 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:53.570 align:start position:0%
requirement
um

00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:53.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
we they're not any instances that I'm
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
aware of
 
00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
um again so we just just wanted to raise
 
00:34:03.049 --> 00:34:03.059 align:start position:0%
that for this body
 
00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
so the only other thing I'd add about
 
00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
that is we do understand that there are
 
00:34:10.970 --> 00:34:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:13.970 --> 00:34:13.980 align:start position:0%
when candidates or political committees
 
00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:17.940 align:start position:0%
may receive contributions that
 
00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:20.580 align:start position:0%
they weren't aware of the fact that the
 
00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:22.260 align:start position:0%
source of the contribution before they
 
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
received it was controversial
 
00:34:29.329 --> 00:34:29.339 align:start position:0%
for some reason so it may be for
 
00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
um and I'm going to forget the letters
 
00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:33.780 align:start position:0%
of the com the cryptocurrency
 
00:34:37.490 --> 00:34:37.500 align:start position:0%
yes and so when you have situations like
 
00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:40.919 align:start position:0%
that then campaigns want to return those
 
00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
contributions or they want to use them
 
00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
for another purpose like give them to a
 
00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:46.740 align:start position:0%
charitable purpose
 
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
so it could be that this language is in
 
00:34:51.169 --> 00:34:51.179 align:start position:0%
there for individuals to be able to say
 
00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:52.919 align:start position:0%
that they didn't provide written consent
 
00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
to accept a contribution like that
 
00:34:57.650 --> 00:34:57.660 align:start position:0%
because they weren't aware of the source
 
00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:00.180 align:start position:0%
sometimes it could also be a situation
 
00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:02.650 align:start position:0%
sometimes it could also be a situation
where

00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:02.660 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:06.060 align:start position:0%
individuals may have given contributions
 
00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
with different names so if you happen to
 
00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:11.700 align:start position:0%
have a hyphenated name like Ann Edwards
 
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
Parker and I gave contributions under
 
00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
Ann Edwards and then I gave
 
00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
contributions under Ann Parker if
 
00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:19.020 align:start position:0%
someone doesn't know me close enough
 
00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:20.700 align:start position:0%
they may not realize that I've
 
00:35:23.329 --> 00:35:23.339 align:start position:0%
contributed more than my share during
 
00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:25.380 align:start position:0%
any election cycle
 
00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
so it may be that that provision is a
 
00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:29.640 align:start position:0%
safe harbor
 
00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:31.980 align:start position:0%
for individuals but we did just want to
 
00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:33.900 align:start position:0%
point out to you that like the Secretary
 
00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:35.460 align:start position:0%
of State's office we're not sure anyone
 
00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:40.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:41.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
um thank you check my question do you
 
00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
know where that requirement is I quickly
 
00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
scanned but I'm not very good at
 
00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
multitasking if you could give me one
 
00:35:53.040 --> 00:36:02.829 align:start position:0%
multitasking if you could give me one
moment

00:36:02.829 --> 00:36:02.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
so you
 
00:36:09.589 --> 00:36:09.599 align:start position:0%
that that is under 664 colon 4 Roman 5
 
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
section 5.
 
00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:19.250 align:start position:0%
section 5.
foreign

00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:20.820 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:30.829 --> 00:36:30.839 align:start position:0%
and just to clarify did you have
 
00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
anything further representative Lane
 
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make sure I didn't want
 
00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
to interrupt you
 
00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:40.440 align:start position:0%
um so finally um the last point that we
 
00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:41.150 align:start position:0%
um so finally um the last point that we
wanted

00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
wanted
 
00:36:44.109 --> 00:36:44.119 align:start position:0%
um to raise before this body was under
 
00:36:48.829 --> 00:36:48.839 align:start position:0%
RSA 6647 I've quoted
 
00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
um the language there that we are just
 
00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
we have read to interpret that if a
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
political Committee of a party is
 
00:36:59.390 --> 00:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
supporting a candidate then the
 
00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:02.460 align:start position:0%
candidate would not need to disclose how
 
00:37:04.609 --> 00:37:04.619 align:start position:0%
much that political committee has
 
00:37:08.569 --> 00:37:08.579 align:start position:0%
supported them again not a point of
 
00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:10.200 align:start position:0%
illegality or anything that we're
 
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
raising but we did just want to bring to
 
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
this body's attention that that's that
 
00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:17.640 align:start position:0%
is how we are interpreting that wording
 
00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
in 664 colon seven
 
00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:22.270 align:start position:0%
in 664 colon seven

00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:22.280 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:24.780 align:start position:0%
very final issue that we don't have on
 
00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
here is we issued a letter regarding
 
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance during the last cycle
 
00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
and in that letter we put a chart in
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
that and so now with some of the review
 
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
of the changes to the statute and
 
00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:40.260 align:start position:0%
upcoming changes the information in that
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
chart is not accurate as to how we would
 
00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:46.380 align:start position:0%
be enforcing the law at this time
 
00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:48.900 align:start position:0%
so we will be updating that chart but we
 
00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:52.260 align:start position:0%
have not updated it yet
 
00:37:59.810 --> 00:37:59.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you
 
00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
um thanks for all your work on this and
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
for your help as we
 
00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
know any guidance as we review this
 
00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:11.460 align:start position:0%
section of the of the
 
00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:12.109 align:start position:0%
section of the of the
um

00:38:12.109 --> 00:38:12.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:13.980 align:start position:0%
of election law
 
00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:15.900 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:18.060 align:start position:0%
and I have just two two questions one is
 
00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
about late reports
 
00:38:24.069 --> 00:38:24.079 align:start position:0%
um roughly speaking if you're to guess
 
00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:27.780 align:start position:0%
what fraction of late reports are a few
 
00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:30.180 align:start position:0%
weeks late or a few days late let's say
 
00:38:31.849 --> 00:38:31.859 align:start position:0%
less than two months late and what
 
00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
fraction are more than two months sleep
 
00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:38.700 align:start position:0%
um I am I am speculating
 
00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:40.200 align:start position:0%
um I I don't have a hard number for you
 
00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:42.420 align:start position:0%
but I would say based based on my
 
00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:45.660 align:start position:0%
conversations with um Jill who is the
 
00:38:48.290 --> 00:38:48.300 align:start position:0%
the point person on most of this
 
00:38:50.569 --> 00:38:50.579 align:start position:0%
um the majority of the ones that are
 
00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:53.820 align:start position:0%
filed late are are within within days or
 
00:38:56.990 --> 00:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
weeks of um of the filing date
 
00:38:59.630 --> 00:38:59.640 align:start position:0%
we're not my recollection is that we're
 
00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
not seeing a what I would call a
 
00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:05.700 align:start position:0%
significant number that are extremely
 
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
well beyond
 
00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
um reporting deadlines
 
00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
to and while that's accurate I I believe
 
00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:13.380 align:start position:0%
one of the other points is especially
 
00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
with candidates candidates don't have to
 
00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:17.940 align:start position:0%
report until the Wednesday before the
 
00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
campaign so if they're a few days late
 
00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
that means they could be after the
 
00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:25.730 align:start position:0%
that means they could be after the
election

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:25.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:33.589 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:39:33.589 --> 00:39:33.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:35.820 align:start position:0%
oh you want to jump in
 
00:39:38.329 --> 00:39:38.339 align:start position:0%
on the illegible reports and on the
 
00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
reports with math errors there was a
 
00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:41.940 align:start position:0%
sense that some small number of
 
00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:43.260 align:start position:0%
candidates might be doing that
 
00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:46.140 align:start position:0%
strategically in order to create opacity
 
00:39:49.069 --> 00:39:49.079 align:start position:0%
so that their finances aren't really
 
00:39:49.079 --> 00:39:50.630 align:start position:0%
so that their finances aren't really
visible

00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
visible
 
00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
um is do you sometimes suspect that a
 
00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:54.660 align:start position:0%
small number of candidates are filing
 
00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:56.940 align:start position:0%
late for that with that strategic view
 
00:40:01.849 --> 00:40:01.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:04.020 align:start position:0%
yes at times we have thought that that
 
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:15.540 align:start position:0%
thank you uh going back to the
 
00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:18.420 align:start position:0%
distinction between candidate and
 
00:40:21.290 --> 00:40:21.300 align:start position:0%
candidate committee I think that was
 
00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:25.380 align:start position:0%
um 2B I'm not mistaken
 
00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:27.660 align:start position:0%
um from an enforcement standpoint would
 
00:40:29.569 --> 00:40:29.579 align:start position:0%
it make a difference
 
00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
um and because we've been talking about
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
that as well and I'm just wondering from
 
00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:36.540 align:start position:0%
an enforcement standpoint is there any
 
00:40:42.829 --> 00:40:42.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
so um obviously I'll turn this over to
 
00:40:47.329 --> 00:40:47.339 align:start position:0%
attorney Edwards if she has anything to
 
00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
add after this
 
00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:52.740 align:start position:0%
what that would help with is we've we
 
00:40:56.089 --> 00:40:56.099 align:start position:0%
have raised a number of points here that
 
00:40:58.069 --> 00:40:58.079 align:start position:0%
um are aimed at the the simple goal of
 
00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:00.300 align:start position:0%
cutting down confusion
 
00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:03.900 align:start position:0%
um and just that alone is going to cut
 
00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:06.300 align:start position:0%
down on errors it's going to cut down on
 
00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
the time that we spend going through
 
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
these so that the my understanding is
 
00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:13.140 align:start position:0%
that the candidate versus candidate
 
00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:14.940 align:start position:0%
committee that is a point that we raise
 
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
that we believe would help to cut down
 
00:41:20.589 --> 00:41:20.599 align:start position:0%
on confusion and the
 
00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:23.640 align:start position:0%
compacting errors that can result from a
 
00:41:25.609 --> 00:41:25.619 align:start position:0%
sense of confusion but I don't believe
 
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
there would be significant enforcement
 
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
concerns beyond that okay thank you
 
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
and if I could just add I do believe
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
that so one of the challenges from the
 
00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:39.780 align:start position:0%
candidate's position is and as the
 
00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:41.460 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary of state has raised
 
00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:44.460 align:start position:0%
recently there is confusion between the
 
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
need to register the need to report
 
00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
and it they become conflated and then it
 
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
becomes confusing to people so
 
00:41:57.290 --> 00:41:57.300 align:start position:0%
candidates currently don't have to
 
00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
register a candidate committee has to
 
00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:04.740 align:start position:0%
register both a candidate and Bo and a
 
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
candidate committee have to report and
 
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
so in order for a candidate to use the
 
00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
online campaign Finance system they do
 
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
have to register to use the system but
 
00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:19.740 align:start position:0%
that's it's a difference that might make
 
00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
a difference to some candidates because
 
00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
they feel like they don't have to
 
00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:24.300 align:start position:0%
register and they shouldn't have to
 
00:42:26.089 --> 00:42:26.099 align:start position:0%
register because they're doing things on
 
00:42:27.109 --> 00:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
their own
 
00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:29.700 align:start position:0%
and that they'll report their receipts
 
00:42:31.069 --> 00:42:31.079 align:start position:0%
and expenditures
 
00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
otherwise in accordance with the law but
 
00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:37.020 align:start position:0%
it does cause confusion because when
 
00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:38.700 align:start position:0%
especially when new candidates are
 
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
becoming involved in the process and
 
00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:42.060 align:start position:0%
they're looking at it and they're trying
 
00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:43.740 align:start position:0%
to figure out which they have to do
 
00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
we're happy to answer questions the
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office is happy to
 
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
answer questions but it would just be
 
00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:51.660 align:start position:0%
helpful if we could come to an agreement
 
00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:52.609 align:start position:0%
helpful if we could come to an agreement
where

00:42:52.609 --> 00:42:52.619 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:42:55.609 --> 00:42:55.619 align:start position:0%
the law was clearer on that issue and I
 
00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:57.240 align:start position:0%
think that that's a decision for the
 
00:43:01.309 --> 00:43:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
and thank you another big picture
 
00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:04.550 align:start position:0%
and thank you another big picture
question

00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:05.329 align:start position:0%
question
um

00:43:05.329 --> 00:43:05.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:08.329 --> 00:43:08.339 align:start position:0%
and I'm curious about whether in your
 
00:43:10.849 --> 00:43:10.859 align:start position:0%
office you you ever
 
00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
um just kind of hit yourselves in the
 
00:43:16.069 --> 00:43:16.079 align:start position:0%
head and think gosh you know there are
 
00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:19.260 align:start position:0%
ways of just evading this entire system
 
00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:21.780 align:start position:0%
of of reporting
 
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
um that we can't do anything about
 
00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:24.900 align:start position:0%
because of the way the law is written
 
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
and not written and
 
00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:30.060 align:start position:0%
um you know if the legislature really
 
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
cared about transparency and and
 
00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:34.309 align:start position:0%
cared about transparency and and
tracking

00:43:34.309 --> 00:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
tracking
 
00:43:36.349 --> 00:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
um donations out of a kind of
 
00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
anti-corruption in uh you know interest
 
00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:43.260 align:start position:0%
it would address this and and if so and
 
00:43:46.849 --> 00:43:46.859 align:start position:0%
be curious to know what what those uh
 
00:43:49.730 --> 00:43:49.740 align:start position:0%
what gives rise to that kind of reaction
 
00:43:52.849 --> 00:43:52.859 align:start position:0%
so I think as we always say and we have
 
00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:54.660 align:start position:0%
no reason not to say it New Hampshire
 
00:43:57.290 --> 00:43:57.300 align:start position:0%
runs good elections we don't believe
 
00:44:02.329 --> 00:44:02.339 align:start position:0%
that there are organizations that are
 
00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:05.220 align:start position:0%
I guess I wouldn't use a word corruption
 
00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
for anything I we don't see any evidence
 
00:44:10.609 --> 00:44:10.619 align:start position:0%
of that but there are definitely ways of
 
00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:12.900 align:start position:0%
skirting the system so it doesn't take
 
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
very much to become a political
 
00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:17.220 align:start position:0%
committee and if you stay under the
 
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
funding amounts of twenty five hundred
 
00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:22.140 align:start position:0%
dollars or a thousand dollars depending
 
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
on which type of political committee or
 
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
5000 you are you don't have to report
 
00:44:30.170 --> 00:44:30.180 align:start position:0%
and you don't have to register and so we
 
00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:33.780 align:start position:0%
do have organizations that do do that
 
00:44:37.069 --> 00:44:37.079 align:start position:0%
and they do smaller mailers and they
 
00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:39.300 align:start position:0%
have multiple political committees and
 
00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
they're doing that because they can keep
 
00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
all of those committees under a level
 
00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
and therefore they don't have to report
 
00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:48.780 align:start position:0%
there's nothing unlawful about doing
 
00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:49.730 align:start position:0%
there's nothing unlawful about doing
that

00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:49.740 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:52.700 align:start position:0%
but it's there and again as we always
 
00:44:56.450 --> 00:44:56.460 align:start position:0%
promote the point of campaign Finance is
 
00:44:59.089 --> 00:44:59.099 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the public has the
 
00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:01.500 align:start position:0%
ability to determine as much as possible
 
00:45:04.609 --> 00:45:04.619 align:start position:0%
within the bounds of the law who is
 
00:45:06.589 --> 00:45:06.599 align:start position:0%
supporting a candidate or who is
 
00:45:08.809 --> 00:45:08.819 align:start position:0%
supporting an issue or opposing a
 
00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:10.980 align:start position:0%
candidate or opposing an issue so it's
 
00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
important to have that information
 
00:45:16.010 --> 00:45:16.020 align:start position:0%
available as much as possible it is one
 
00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:18.420 align:start position:0%
of the reasons why you'll see like in
 
00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:20.700 align:start position:0%
the last Town elections in Municipal
 
00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:22.150 align:start position:0%
the last Town elections in Municipal
elections

00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
elections
 
00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:24.900 align:start position:0%
the individuals don't actually have to
 
00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
form a political committee and they
 
00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:28.740 align:start position:0%
don't have to report their expenditures
 
00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
but they still have to identify the
 
00:45:34.609 --> 00:45:34.619 align:start position:0%
organization in a meaningful manner on
 
00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
signs and on mailers and phone calls
 
00:45:40.609 --> 00:45:40.619 align:start position:0%
that they put out and we track down on
 
00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
that and it takes a it's a lot of effort
 
00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:45.540 align:start position:0%
in a short period of time because it's
 
00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
really important for people to
 
00:45:49.730 --> 00:45:49.740 align:start position:0%
understand whether the mailers they're
 
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
receiving are from their neighbors who
 
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
are concerned about I don't know the new
 
00:45:58.730 --> 00:45:58.740 align:start position:0%
power plant or the new dump going into
 
00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
the landfill going in place or whether
 
00:46:04.730 --> 00:46:04.740 align:start position:0%
it's somebody from out of town or out of
 
00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
state who's supporting that so
 
00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
I don't that's one of the reasons why we
 
00:46:13.069 --> 00:46:13.079 align:start position:0%
suggested that if political committees
 
00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
are going to be active in an election
 
00:46:17.690 --> 00:46:17.700 align:start position:0%
cycle we believe the political committee
 
00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
should have to at least register even if
 
00:46:22.569 --> 00:46:22.579 align:start position:0%
they don't have to report their numbers
 
00:46:25.069 --> 00:46:25.079 align:start position:0%
to a certain point they should have to
 
00:46:25.079 --> 00:46:26.750 align:start position:0%
to a certain point they should have to
register

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
register
 
00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:29.460 align:start position:0%
and we'd also say that based on some of
 
00:46:31.309 --> 00:46:31.319 align:start position:0%
our investigations it's really expensive
 
00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:33.540 align:start position:0%
to do a political mailer so unless
 
00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
they're doing something that's being
 
00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
done on a local level and have found a
 
00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:40.140 align:start position:0%
really great bargain it's it's costing
 
00:46:42.890 --> 00:46:42.900 align:start position:0%
about three to four thousand dollars to
 
00:46:45.530 --> 00:46:45.540 align:start position:0%
do a good size political mailing in a
 
00:46:48.050 --> 00:46:48.060 align:start position:0%
community or a small part of the county
 
00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
if you're doing a larger
 
00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh political mailer you're well over ten
 
00:46:55.309 --> 00:46:55.319 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars so there's a lot of
 
00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:05.329 --> 00:47:05.339 align:start position:0%
I have a question
 
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh again or at least a rough estimate
 
00:47:12.190 --> 00:47:12.200 align:start position:0%
uh how many instances of
 
00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
improperly identified political
 
00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:17.220 align:start position:0%
advertising do you see in a given
 
00:47:20.569 --> 00:47:20.579 align:start position:0%
election cycle roughly
 
00:47:23.569 --> 00:47:23.579 align:start position:0%
so in the last so this has become our
 
00:47:25.490 --> 00:47:25.500 align:start position:0%
full-time business and part of what we
 
00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:27.900 align:start position:0%
did was we sort of
 
00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:28.790 align:start position:0%
did was we sort of
um

00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:31.550 --> 00:47:31.560 align:start position:0%
we didn't swear them in but we started
 
00:47:33.890 --> 00:47:33.900 align:start position:0%
asking for the Public's health help in
 
00:47:38.210 --> 00:47:38.220 align:start position:0%
2022 in particular and so we issue as we
 
00:47:41.210 --> 00:47:41.220 align:start position:0%
started tracking mailer complaints that
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
we were getting we started putting out
 
00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:45.240 align:start position:0%
daily press releases or every other day
 
00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
press releases outlining the information
 
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
that we were finding out because as I
 
00:47:52.849 --> 00:47:52.859 align:start position:0%
said these Anonymous mailers tend to go
 
00:47:54.829 --> 00:47:54.839 align:start position:0%
out in the two-week time period before
 
00:47:57.170 --> 00:47:57.180 align:start position:0%
the election and the the thought is
 
00:47:58.970 --> 00:47:58.980 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be able to figure out
 
00:48:01.370 --> 00:48:01.380 align:start position:0%
who it is and it's become a mission for
 
00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
us to do that and what we found is by
 
00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
bringing in members of the public we can
 
00:48:09.290 --> 00:48:09.300 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly get extra hands on this
 
00:48:11.329 --> 00:48:11.339 align:start position:0%
and people seem to be interested in
 
00:48:14.690 --> 00:48:14.700 align:start position:0%
helping so we we
 
00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
I mean I don't even know we had
 
00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:19.980 align:start position:0%
during this last Municipal cycle so
 
00:48:21.710 --> 00:48:21.720 align:start position:0%
there are three times that the
 
00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:23.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities can vote they can vote
 
00:48:26.450 --> 00:48:26.460 align:start position:0%
the towns they can vote in March and
 
00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:29.640 align:start position:0%
April and May and in all three of those
 
00:48:32.210 --> 00:48:32.220 align:start position:0%
we had at least
 
00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:35.220 align:start position:0%
two or three for each one and in March I
 
00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:37.740 align:start position:0%
think at one point we were running 15
 
00:48:41.210 --> 00:48:41.220 align:start position:0%
of them that were Anonymous mailers and
 
00:48:43.609 --> 00:48:43.619 align:start position:0%
while that doesn't sound like a lot it's
 
00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:46.200 align:start position:0%
hard to track that down because we do we
 
00:48:49.309 --> 00:48:49.319 align:start position:0%
have limited information in order to use
 
00:48:51.170 --> 00:48:51.180 align:start position:0%
and we have criminal investigators in
 
00:48:52.609 --> 00:48:52.619 align:start position:0%
our office and we put the criminal
 
00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
investigators on those
 
00:48:59.450 --> 00:48:59.460 align:start position:0%
those mailers so it's during the 2022
 
00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:00.890 align:start position:0%
those mailers so it's during the 2022
election

00:49:00.890 --> 00:49:00.900 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:03.720 align:start position:0%
we had some
 
00:49:06.530 --> 00:49:06.540 align:start position:0%
but I don't we didn't have as many it
 
00:49:09.589 --> 00:49:09.599 align:start position:0%
tends to be us an item that's used more
 
00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:12.180 align:start position:0%
in the Municipal elections and it's you
 
00:49:15.829 --> 00:49:15.839 align:start position:0%
including the city elections then it is
 
00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
but even
 
00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
I mean actually as I say that we still
 
00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:21.349 align:start position:0%
I mean actually as I say that we still
had

00:49:21.349 --> 00:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:49:24.170 --> 00:49:24.180 align:start position:0%
um we still had mailers and signs there
 
00:49:27.290 --> 00:49:27.300 align:start position:0%
were a lot of signs in 2022 that went up
 
00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
for the major elections the Statewide
 
00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
elections that didn't have disclaimers
 
00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:33.780 align:start position:0%
on them so we have to track those down
 
00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
too I you know I don't think we've ever
 
00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:37.370 align:start position:0%
too I you know I don't think we've ever
had

00:49:37.370 --> 00:49:37.380 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:49:39.829 --> 00:49:39.839 align:start position:0%
if I ballpark this we've never had more
 
00:49:42.589 --> 00:49:42.599 align:start position:0%
than 50 at a time but we may have had as
 
00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
many as 25 during an election cycle
 
00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:49.640 align:start position:0%
between 25 and 30.
 
00:49:55.069 --> 00:49:55.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:58.010 --> 00:49:58.020 align:start position:0%
when an option there for the big mailers
 
00:49:59.150 --> 00:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
you know they're done they're usually
 
00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
done by a printing shop we're not
 
00:50:02.089 --> 00:50:02.099 align:start position:0%
talking about something Jet
 
00:50:03.770 --> 00:50:03.780 align:start position:0%
um what an option there be to find the
 
00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:05.630 align:start position:0%
um what an option there be to find the
printer

00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
printer
 
00:50:07.970 --> 00:50:07.980 align:start position:0%
that is definitely an option if we had
 
00:50:09.770 --> 00:50:09.780 align:start position:0%
that in a law that one of the challenges
 
00:50:11.770 --> 00:50:11.780 align:start position:0%
is many of those
 
00:50:14.569 --> 00:50:14.579 align:start position:0%
mailings are done out of state so we
 
00:50:16.550 --> 00:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
have to cross state borders to find
 
00:50:18.349 --> 00:50:18.359 align:start position:0%
those individuals and we right now are
 
00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:21.300 align:start position:0%
in the process of dealing with one
 
00:50:23.690 --> 00:50:23.700 align:start position:0%
organization that has done a mailer out
 
00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:27.060 align:start position:0%
of Massachusetts and it's a lot it's a
 
00:50:30.050 --> 00:50:30.060 align:start position:0%
challenge to do that and so I I can tell
 
00:50:31.609 --> 00:50:31.619 align:start position:0%
you that on some of the large mailers
 
00:50:34.030 --> 00:50:34.040 align:start position:0%
that happened in 2020
 
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
we were
 
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
um we have print shops that are out in
 
00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
the Midwest
 
00:50:41.450 --> 00:50:41.460 align:start position:0%
that we're dealing with
 
00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:42.770 align:start position:0%
that we're dealing with
full

00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:42.780 align:start position:0%
full
 
00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:44.940 align:start position:0%
but we assuming you can find I
 
00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
understand it's difficult to find them
 
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
when they go like I get it but we do
 
00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
actually have the ability to legally we
 
00:50:51.049 --> 00:50:51.059 align:start position:0%
would have the ability if it was in the
 
00:50:52.490 --> 00:50:52.500 align:start position:0%
law to find them
 
00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:54.540 align:start position:0%
you could because they are okay and then
 
00:50:55.790 --> 00:50:55.800 align:start position:0%
the question is whether we can actually
 
00:50:58.130 --> 00:50:58.140 align:start position:0%
get the fine to apply to them because
 
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
they're out of state but yes and there
 
00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
are there are a fair amount of printers
 
00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:04.260 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire and in
 
00:51:06.349 --> 00:51:06.359 align:start position:0%
order to make sure that I'm not
 
00:51:09.349 --> 00:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
maligning anyone they the out-of-state
 
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
printers don't necessarily know the
 
00:51:13.010 --> 00:51:13.020 align:start position:0%
state law and they rely on the
 
00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
individuals who are requesting the
 
00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:16.740 align:start position:0%
mailers to provide them with the state
 
00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:19.800 align:start position:0%
law so that's one of the challenges
 
00:51:21.829 --> 00:51:21.839 align:start position:0%
there in the state of New Hampshire the
 
00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
printers generally understand the state
 
00:51:25.609 --> 00:51:25.619 align:start position:0%
law and they know what's required on
 
00:51:27.950 --> 00:51:27.960 align:start position:0%
there in disclosure and so when we talk
 
00:51:30.410 --> 00:51:30.420 align:start position:0%
with them there are times that they have
 
00:51:32.530 --> 00:51:32.540 align:start position:0%
been told not to
 
00:51:37.730 --> 00:51:37.740 align:start position:0%
disclose the individual and then we have
 
00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:40.260 align:start position:0%
broader conversations about why that is
 
00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:42.300 align:start position:0%
and there's just so you know generally
 
00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:45.720 align:start position:0%
there's a case called uh McIntyre the
 
00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
state of Maine versus McIntyre which Mr
 
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
McIntyre decided to go out he was very
 
00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:52.740 align:start position:0%
angry about an issue on the ballot he
 
00:51:54.890 --> 00:51:54.900 align:start position:0%
went out and he photocopied a whole
 
00:51:57.710 --> 00:51:57.720 align:start position:0%
bunch of Flyers against the issue and he
 
00:51:59.450 --> 00:51:59.460 align:start position:0%
stuck him under people's windshields at
 
00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
the grocery store parking lot in order
 
00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
to show his discontent and try to get
 
00:52:06.650 --> 00:52:06.660 align:start position:0%
people to vote against it he was allowed
 
00:52:08.690 --> 00:52:08.700 align:start position:0%
to do that and because he did it on his
 
00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
own he was allowed to do that and not
 
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
put his name on the bottom of it though
 
00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
he had been sued for failing to disclose
 
00:52:18.650 --> 00:52:18.660 align:start position:0%
so people are protected under McIntyre
 
00:52:20.930 --> 00:52:20.940 align:start position:0%
if they're an individual so if I choose
 
00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
to to vote against
 
00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
whether maple syrup should be our state
 
00:52:29.690 --> 00:52:29.700 align:start position:0%
treat then I can go and do that and and
 
00:52:31.730 --> 00:52:31.740 align:start position:0%
function on my own I can even go to a
 
00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
printer and pay the printer as long as
 
00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:35.400 align:start position:0%
the printer is just printing the copies
 
00:52:38.329 --> 00:52:38.339 align:start position:0%
for me but if Matt and I did that
 
00:52:40.609 --> 00:52:40.619 align:start position:0%
together we're now a political committee
 
00:52:43.549 --> 00:52:43.559 align:start position:0%
and at that point we have to put a
 
00:52:45.589 --> 00:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
disclosure on the bottom saying Matt and
 
00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
Ann are against this and this is why
 
00:52:49.069 --> 00:52:49.079 align:start position:0%
they're you know here's their statement
 
00:52:52.250 --> 00:52:52.260 align:start position:0%
so it's you just it I offer all of that
 
00:52:55.069 --> 00:52:55.079 align:start position:0%
information because it is there are ways
 
00:52:57.770 --> 00:52:57.780 align:start position:0%
to for people to continue to assert
 
00:52:59.690 --> 00:52:59.700 align:start position:0%
their first amendment rights and do that
 
00:53:02.569 --> 00:53:02.579 align:start position:0%
without having to disclose who they are
 
00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
and why they're doing it and those
 
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
investigations take us even a longer
 
00:53:08.569 --> 00:53:08.579 align:start position:0%
period of time because we then have to
 
00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
protect those people's names when we
 
00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:13.380 align:start position:0%
determine who they are but it becomes
 
00:53:15.349 --> 00:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
that's when we hit resistance from the
 
00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
local printers because the local
 
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
printers understand that too and so we
 
00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
have to go through a process to be able
 
00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
to confirm that no one has committed a
 
00:53:34.809 --> 00:53:34.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:37.730 --> 00:53:37.740 align:start position:0%
you may not be able to answer this but
 
00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
we are trying to deal with the fact that
 
00:53:42.530 --> 00:53:42.540 align:start position:0%
there are nine different and try and
 
00:53:45.410 --> 00:53:45.420 align:start position:0%
come up with a generic
 
00:53:48.290 --> 00:53:48.300 align:start position:0%
um definition and what I keep running
 
00:53:50.809 --> 00:53:50.819 align:start position:0%
into when I try to do that is that in
 
00:53:52.430 --> 00:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
most jurisdictions including hours
 
00:53:55.549 --> 00:53:55.559 align:start position:0%
because there's been this creation of
 
00:53:58.370 --> 00:53:58.380 align:start position:0%
all these different kinds of packs
 
00:54:02.089 --> 00:54:02.099 align:start position:0%
that they uh segregate out and have
 
00:54:04.010 --> 00:54:04.020 align:start position:0%
special rules for those different kind
 
00:54:06.589 --> 00:54:06.599 align:start position:0%
of packs which I'm guessing is the
 
00:54:07.790 --> 00:54:07.800 align:start position:0%
reason we have all the different
 
00:54:10.370 --> 00:54:10.380 align:start position:0%
spending in the reporting because they
 
00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:16.730 --> 00:54:16.740 align:start position:0%
do you I've got two two very good
 
00:54:19.010 --> 00:54:19.020 align:start position:0%
lawyers in front of me are is there any
 
00:54:21.410 --> 00:54:21.420 align:start position:0%
way that you can think of that we can
 
00:54:24.109 --> 00:54:24.119 align:start position:0%
simplify it because you what triggered
 
00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
it was when you said you referenced the
 
00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
two of you and that is a committee
 
00:54:30.890 --> 00:54:30.900 align:start position:0%
and if we do that that's one question
 
00:54:34.490 --> 00:54:34.500 align:start position:0%
and then second one would be how then do
 
00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
we differentiate
 
00:54:38.569 --> 00:54:38.579 align:start position:0%
what they're doing is it what their
 
00:54:41.210 --> 00:54:41.220 align:start position:0%
expenditures aren't going for like
 
00:54:44.569 --> 00:54:44.579 align:start position:0%
independent expenditures or is it going
 
00:54:44.579 --> 00:54:46.309 align:start position:0%
independent expenditures or is it going
towards

00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
towards
 
00:54:49.130 --> 00:54:49.140 align:start position:0%
um is it a political uh like the
 
00:54:51.290 --> 00:54:51.300 align:start position:0%
candidate committee
 
00:54:54.650 --> 00:54:54.660 align:start position:0%
and and can they I we are having a
 
00:54:56.510 --> 00:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
problem trying to identify how to
 
00:54:58.510 --> 00:54:58.520 align:start position:0%
simplify it
 
00:55:01.270 --> 00:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
and you're not alone
 
00:55:04.730 --> 00:55:04.740 align:start position:0%
we we are happy to continue to have
 
00:55:06.589 --> 00:55:06.599 align:start position:0%
conversations with Secretary of State's
 
00:55:08.809 --> 00:55:08.819 align:start position:0%
office about this we have been talking
 
00:55:10.970 --> 00:55:10.980 align:start position:0%
about it and
 
00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
um it's it is a challenge because back
 
00:55:16.370 --> 00:55:16.380 align:start position:0%
in the olden days we began with just a
 
00:55:18.349 --> 00:55:18.359 align:start position:0%
political committee and it was if it was
 
00:55:20.990 --> 00:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
two people together doing something then
 
00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
they were a political committee and
 
00:55:24.890 --> 00:55:24.900 align:start position:0%
still at that time we didn't want to
 
00:55:26.569 --> 00:55:26.579 align:start position:0%
have everybody have to necessarily
 
00:55:28.849 --> 00:55:28.859 align:start position:0%
register unless they started spending
 
00:55:31.309 --> 00:55:31.319 align:start position:0%
money and so that's one of the reasons
 
00:55:33.770 --> 00:55:33.780 align:start position:0%
why our suggestion is if we start maybe
 
00:55:35.630 --> 00:55:35.640 align:start position:0%
with registration
 
00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
and have everyone register at least we
 
00:55:41.569 --> 00:55:41.579 align:start position:0%
know the entities that are out there and
 
00:55:44.809 --> 00:55:44.819 align:start position:0%
we have combined two of your nine
 
00:55:47.450 --> 00:55:47.460 align:start position:0%
already so we now have eight because
 
00:55:50.089 --> 00:55:50.099 align:start position:0%
that this they're just too closely
 
00:55:52.370 --> 00:55:52.380 align:start position:0%
aligned to not do that but then you end
 
00:55:55.490 --> 00:55:55.500 align:start position:0%
up with a different expenditure level
 
00:55:58.010 --> 00:55:58.020 align:start position:0%
and uh so we will continue to work with
 
00:55:59.270 --> 00:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office about
 
00:56:01.370 --> 00:56:01.380 align:start position:0%
suggesting some language we don't have
 
00:56:04.010 --> 00:56:04.020 align:start position:0%
an an immediate answer for you on that
 
00:56:07.370 --> 00:56:07.380 align:start position:0%
but we too think it would be easier to
 
00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:09.240 align:start position:0%
try to do that the challenge is as
 
00:56:10.670 --> 00:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
you've identified representative Lane
 
00:56:12.410 --> 00:56:12.420 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:56:15.230 --> 00:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
some of this is also overflow from
 
00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
federal elections and and so these
 
00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
different organizations who come into
 
00:56:22.970 --> 00:56:22.980 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire usually only every two
 
00:56:26.210 --> 00:56:26.220 align:start position:0%
years for the major elections come in
 
00:56:28.309 --> 00:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
here and they want to understand how
 
00:56:30.410 --> 00:56:30.420 align:start position:0%
they have to report if they have to
 
00:56:33.589 --> 00:56:33.599 align:start position:0%
report and they like to have the
 
00:56:37.010 --> 00:56:37.020 align:start position:0%
reporting systems look similar across
 
00:56:38.329 --> 00:56:38.339 align:start position:0%
the states because it just makes it
 
00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:40.740 align:start position:0%
easier for them on a national level
 
00:56:42.890 --> 00:56:42.900 align:start position:0%
and I think that that is part of the
 
00:56:44.450 --> 00:56:44.460 align:start position:0%
reasons why we have what we have and
 
00:56:46.010 --> 00:56:46.020 align:start position:0%
that's why we have some different levels
 
00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't mean that New Hampshire
 
00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:49.490 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't mean that New Hampshire
can't

00:56:49.490 --> 00:56:49.500 align:start position:0%
can't
 
00:56:59.870 --> 00:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:02.510 --> 00:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
yes I have a thank you for taking my
 
00:57:04.069 --> 00:57:04.079 align:start position:0%
question I have a question about two
 
00:57:06.349 --> 00:57:06.359 align:start position:0%
other types of committee I'm not
 
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
there's a type that that's major
 
00:57:12.290 --> 00:57:12.300 align:start position:0%
purposes influencing elections
 
00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
and another type that uh
 
00:57:18.049 --> 00:57:18.059 align:start position:0%
influenza collections is not its major
 
00:57:19.690 --> 00:57:19.700 align:start position:0%
purpose and they have two different
 
00:57:22.069 --> 00:57:22.079 align:start position:0%
spending thresholds at which they have
 
00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
to begin to report
 
00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
right yes from the enforcement side is
 
00:57:32.329 --> 00:57:32.339 align:start position:0%
that add any difficulty in determining
 
00:57:36.049 --> 00:57:36.059 align:start position:0%
which is which in particular cases it
 
00:57:36.059 --> 00:57:37.549 align:start position:0%
which is which in particular cases it
certainly

00:57:37.549 --> 00:57:37.559 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:57:40.430 --> 00:57:40.440 align:start position:0%
it it causes challenges in figuring out
 
00:57:43.130 --> 00:57:43.140 align:start position:0%
whether they've reported on time based
 
00:57:45.650 --> 00:57:45.660 align:start position:0%
on what it is that they have
 
00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
what their spending limit is the
 
00:57:51.109 --> 00:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
political committee that has its major
 
00:57:53.390 --> 00:57:53.400 align:start position:0%
purposes electioneering we have now
 
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
determined that in enforcement we are
 
00:57:57.230 --> 00:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
going to combine that with a regular
 
00:58:00.290 --> 00:58:00.300 align:start position:0%
political committee because they there
 
00:58:03.049 --> 00:58:03.059 align:start position:0%
just doesn't seem to be enough of a
 
00:58:04.549 --> 00:58:04.559 align:start position:0%
distinction there there doesn't seem to
 
00:58:06.890 --> 00:58:06.900 align:start position:0%
be any legal distinction in our mind and
 
00:58:08.450 --> 00:58:08.460 align:start position:0%
reviewing it
 
00:58:08.460 --> 00:58:10.609 align:start position:0%
reviewing it
and

00:58:10.609 --> 00:58:10.619 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:13.730 --> 00:58:13.740 align:start position:0%
why there's a political committee whose
 
00:58:17.690 --> 00:58:17.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
I mean we can think of different
 
00:58:21.770 --> 00:58:21.780 align:start position:0%
organizations that do things so if I'm
 
00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
an attorney I'm a member of the New
 
00:58:25.010 --> 00:58:25.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Bar Association the New
 
00:58:28.329 --> 00:58:28.339 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Bar Association does Lobby
 
00:58:32.650 --> 00:58:32.660 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't do political
 
00:58:35.390 --> 00:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
electioneering but at lobbies and so
 
00:58:38.030 --> 00:58:38.040 align:start position:0%
that's the type of organization there
 
00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
could be a corporation that has a um
 
00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
segregated account that's the other type
 
00:58:46.010 --> 00:58:46.020 align:start position:0%
of organization one of the other types
 
00:58:49.490 --> 00:58:49.500 align:start position:0%
of organizations so we can see why these
 
00:58:52.130 --> 00:58:52.140 align:start position:0%
all came out this way but it doesn't
 
00:58:53.750 --> 00:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean that we couldn't
 
00:58:56.270 --> 00:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
combine some of them
 
00:58:59.630 --> 00:58:59.640 align:start position:0%
in into
 
00:59:02.690 --> 00:59:02.700 align:start position:0%
into one or into a couple of them
 
00:59:04.609 --> 00:59:04.619 align:start position:0%
instead of having so many separate ones
 
00:59:06.770 --> 00:59:06.780 align:start position:0%
that is one of the challenges that the
 
00:59:08.750 --> 00:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office is facing in
 
00:59:10.370 --> 00:59:10.380 align:start position:0%
working on creating a new campaign
 
00:59:13.250 --> 00:59:13.260 align:start position:0%
Finance system because there are so many
 
00:59:15.950 --> 00:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
different committees and if somebody
 
00:59:18.650 --> 00:59:18.660 align:start position:0%
chooses the wrong one then that causes
 
00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
another challenge
 
00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.390 align:start position:0%
another challenge
so

00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:26.210 --> 00:59:26.220 align:start position:0%
we're not exactly sure why they were
 
00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
established this way except for the fact
 
00:59:29.690 --> 00:59:29.700 align:start position:0%
that we're sure that some organization
 
00:59:33.589 --> 00:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
came in uh and it could be I could see
 
00:59:35.390 --> 00:59:35.400 align:start position:0%
one of the political committees without
 
00:59:37.970 --> 00:59:37.980 align:start position:0%
the major purpose not for electioneering
 
00:59:40.130 --> 00:59:40.140 align:start position:0%
could be one of the get out the vote
 
00:59:43.309 --> 00:59:43.319 align:start position:0%
committees who came in and is is doing
 
00:59:45.410 --> 00:59:45.420 align:start position:0%
some activities that might be
 
00:59:47.089 --> 00:59:47.099 align:start position:0%
electioneering on a certain party
 
00:59:49.970 --> 00:59:49.980 align:start position:0%
perhaps but is generally here as a get
 
00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
out the vote initiative
 
00:59:56.809 --> 00:59:56.819 align:start position:0%
for college students or for individuals
 
00:59:59.510 --> 00:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
working at grocery stores or something
 
01:00:01.730 --> 01:00:01.740 align:start position:0%
like that so
 
01:00:03.410 --> 01:00:03.420 align:start position:0%
I don't have a good answer I don't think
 
01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
for your question that's fine I don't
 
01:00:07.130 --> 01:00:07.140 align:start position:0%
have a good answer either
 
01:00:09.589 --> 01:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
I I did have the impression reading
 
01:00:12.829 --> 01:00:12.839 align:start position:0%
about the different reporting
 
01:00:15.049 --> 01:00:15.059 align:start position:0%
this requirements for when you need to
 
01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
register because there's different
 
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
expenditure thresholds
 
01:00:24.109 --> 01:00:24.119 align:start position:0%
for when you need to report and there's
 
01:00:27.849 --> 01:00:27.859 align:start position:0%
some cases where it's expenditures or
 
01:00:27.859 --> 01:00:29.390 align:start position:0%
some cases where it's expenditures or
receipts

01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
receipts
 
01:00:34.490 --> 01:00:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
right so it seemed to me that it might
 
01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:39.240 align:start position:0%
be helpful to
 
01:00:41.210 --> 01:00:41.220 align:start position:0%
be more uniform in those requirements
 
01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
but I mean that seems to be the basic
 
01:00:44.270 --> 01:00:44.280 align:start position:0%
distinction between the different types
 
01:00:45.490 --> 01:00:45.500 align:start position:0%
of committees
 
01:00:49.789 --> 01:00:49.799 align:start position:0%
yes okay and it and it also is again it
 
01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:52.200 align:start position:0%
conflates that those terms of
 
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
registration and Reporting together
 
01:00:57.890 --> 01:00:57.900 align:start position:0%
which isn't necessarily helpful because
 
01:01:00.589 --> 01:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
it does it means that peop that
 
01:01:02.329 --> 01:01:02.339 align:start position:0%
organizations I say people but it's
 
01:01:04.609 --> 01:01:04.619 align:start position:0%
always it's organizations or people can
 
01:01:06.829 --> 01:01:06.839 align:start position:0%
out be out doing activities and as long
 
01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
as they stay under that reporting
 
01:01:10.670 --> 01:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
threshold they're never registering
 
01:01:13.309 --> 01:01:13.319 align:start position:0%
and so until something goes wrong or
 
01:01:15.650 --> 01:01:15.660 align:start position:0%
until someone I some organization or
 
01:01:18.349 --> 01:01:18.359 align:start position:0%
entity and identifies them they can be
 
01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
there and be involved in New Hampshire
 
01:01:23.150 --> 01:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
elections without being identified but
 
01:01:25.069 --> 01:01:25.079 align:start position:0%
under the law they're still required to
 
01:01:25.079 --> 01:01:27.770 align:start position:0%
under the law they're still required to
register

01:01:27.770 --> 01:01:27.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:29.930 --> 01:01:29.940 align:start position:0%
okay I've I've read it like four times
 
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
so far it's still
 
01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:33.900 align:start position:0%
getting it loaded into
 
01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
useful memory well and that's and that
 
01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
is exact that's the challenge with it it
 
01:01:40.910 --> 01:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
really is it's the the fact that they
 
01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
don't have to register until they hit a
 
01:01:45.890 --> 01:01:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:01:49.370 --> 01:01:49.380 align:start position:0%
for helping me understand that better
 
01:01:58.970 --> 01:01:58.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:01.010 --> 01:02:01.020 align:start position:0%
immediate solution to me which I'm not
 
01:02:03.530 --> 01:02:03.540 align:start position:0%
sure is really practical is if you
 
01:02:06.170 --> 01:02:06.180 align:start position:0%
register you report
 
01:02:09.410 --> 01:02:09.420 align:start position:0%
and everybody you know
 
01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
or you have a really throat low
 
01:02:13.490 --> 01:02:13.500 align:start position:0%
threshoff or every threshold for
 
01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
everybody but I don't know if anybody
 
01:02:18.849 --> 01:02:18.859 align:start position:0%
even does that
 
01:02:21.170 --> 01:02:21.180 align:start position:0%
I'm just throwing it out but when you
 
01:02:22.670 --> 01:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
said that and I know he's going to
 
01:02:24.410 --> 01:02:24.420 align:start position:0%
disagree with me no no I'm not going to
 
01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
disagree I'm I'm are you talking about
 
01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
okay I don't I don't hate that yeah I
 
01:02:34.609 --> 01:02:34.619 align:start position:0%
mean because the challenge is excuse me
 
01:02:39.230 --> 01:02:39.240 align:start position:0%
the way it works now is if I'm running a
 
01:02:42.589 --> 01:02:42.599 align:start position:0%
political committee and my reporting
 
01:02:45.289 --> 01:02:45.299 align:start position:0%
level is 1500.
 
01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
I and I hit 1600 by close to the end of
 
01:02:50.809 --> 01:02:50.819 align:start position:0%
the election cycle I now have to report
 
01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
I have to report back to dollar one so
 
01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:55.740 align:start position:0%
somewhere I better be tracking all of
 
01:02:58.910 --> 01:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
that information but we just
 
01:03:00.650 --> 01:03:00.660 align:start position:0%
traditionally in New Hampshire have not
 
01:03:03.470 --> 01:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
had organizations reporting from dollar
 
01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:04.970 align:start position:0%
had organizations reporting from dollar
one

01:03:04.970 --> 01:03:04.980 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:03:07.309 --> 01:03:07.319 align:start position:0%
a voluntary organization could do that
 
01:03:09.410 --> 01:03:09.420 align:start position:0%
if it chooses to it's
 
01:03:12.289 --> 01:03:12.299 align:start position:0%
and a candidate would end up doing that
 
01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:15.720 align:start position:0%
if a candidate was making a report but
 
01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
the other political committees do not
 
01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
end up having to do that if they're not
 
01:03:25.930 --> 01:03:25.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:27.829 --> 01:03:27.839 align:start position:0%
believe it or not representatively I
 
01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:29.640 align:start position:0%
actually don't hate that idea
 
01:03:31.789 --> 01:03:31.799 align:start position:0%
especially we won't do it today but
 
01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
especially in the air of what happened
 
01:03:34.670 --> 01:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
in the budget transparency is going to
 
01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
become very important
 
01:03:39.770 --> 01:03:39.780 align:start position:0%
uh representative Rossman so you don't
 
01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
hate that idea would it be a little more
 
01:03:44.690 --> 01:03:44.700 align:start position:0%
specific as to what that idea is
 
01:03:46.569 --> 01:03:46.579 align:start position:0%
um basically
 
01:03:50.450 --> 01:03:50.460 align:start position:0%
representative Lane's idea of if you
 
01:03:52.970 --> 01:03:52.980 align:start position:0%
file you report okay um thank you I
 
01:04:03.410 --> 01:04:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:06.109 --> 01:04:06.119 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if I like that idea or not
 
01:04:08.450 --> 01:04:08.460 align:start position:0%
okay he does hate that two partners for
 
01:04:10.970 --> 01:04:10.980 align:start position:0%
just a moment we don't want to use up
 
01:04:13.870 --> 01:04:13.880 align:start position:0%
here the idea of having everyone
 
01:04:16.250 --> 01:04:16.260 align:start position:0%
involved register
 
01:04:18.829 --> 01:04:18.839 align:start position:0%
Maybe but I have to think about that
 
01:04:20.809 --> 01:04:20.819 align:start position:0%
some more anyway I think representative
 
01:04:23.390 --> 01:04:23.400 align:start position:0%
Muirhead had a question
 
01:04:25.490 --> 01:04:25.500 align:start position:0%
cute I have a question about limits
 
01:04:27.710 --> 01:04:27.720 align:start position:0%
contribution limits
 
01:04:30.170 --> 01:04:30.180 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
01:04:33.250 --> 01:04:33.260 align:start position:0%
and one is rolling over funds from from
 
01:04:36.309 --> 01:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
campaign to campaign from cycle to cycle
 
01:04:40.490 --> 01:04:40.500 align:start position:0%
which might allow a candidate to raise
 
01:04:42.289 --> 01:04:42.299 align:start position:0%
money simultaneously for a previous
 
01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
cycle and a present cycle
 
01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:46.559 align:start position:0%
and and there's also the possibility
 
01:04:48.770 --> 01:04:48.780 align:start position:0%
that say if let's say you raise money
 
01:04:51.950 --> 01:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
for the executive Council race and
 
01:04:54.170 --> 01:04:54.180 align:start position:0%
somebody maxes out
 
01:04:56.089 --> 01:04:56.099 align:start position:0%
um and you you rate you have a surplus
 
01:04:57.770 --> 01:04:57.780 align:start position:0%
and you roll that Surplus into a
 
01:04:59.690 --> 01:04:59.700 align:start position:0%
gubernatorial race
 
01:05:02.089 --> 01:05:02.099 align:start position:0%
did the person who maxed out for your
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
executive Council race are they now able
 
01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
to max out again to the governor's race
 
01:05:08.210 --> 01:05:08.220 align:start position:0%
even though their money is in a sense
 
01:05:11.210 --> 01:05:11.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:14.030 --> 01:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
so that's those are never easy questions
 
01:05:17.930 --> 01:05:17.940 align:start position:0%
to answer sort of as hypotheticals but
 
01:05:21.170 --> 01:05:21.180 align:start position:0%
generally if they're if the executive
 
01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
Council race is completed and there is a
 
01:05:26.690 --> 01:05:26.700 align:start position:0%
surplus that Surplus can be moved into
 
01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:28.609 align:start position:0%
surplus that Surplus can be moved into
another

01:05:28.609 --> 01:05:28.619 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:05:31.849 --> 01:05:31.859 align:start position:0%
another campaign so if it were the
 
01:05:35.210 --> 01:05:35.220 align:start position:0%
primary and I ran for executive Council
 
01:05:39.470 --> 01:05:39.480 align:start position:0%
in the primary and I won and I had
 
01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollars in my
 
01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.309 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollars in my
my

01:05:43.309 --> 01:05:43.319 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:05:43.319 --> 01:05:44.450 align:start position:0%
my
um

01:05:44.450 --> 01:05:44.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:47.390 --> 01:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
I have let's say ten thousand dollars in
 
01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
my Treasury and I want to move it all
 
01:05:52.069 --> 01:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
into the general if if some of that ten
 
01:05:53.510 --> 01:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps most of that ten thousand
 
01:05:56.690 --> 01:05:56.700 align:start position:0%
dollars is a five thousand dollar
 
01:05:59.150 --> 01:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
contribution from an individual then
 
01:06:01.849 --> 01:06:01.859 align:start position:0%
that person can't give again to me in
 
01:06:04.849 --> 01:06:04.859 align:start position:0%
the general election because there that
 
01:06:08.270 --> 01:06:08.280 align:start position:0%
is there is a and arguably there is a
 
01:06:10.490 --> 01:06:10.500 align:start position:0%
clear connection that I collected I was
 
01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
allowed to collect more I just couldn't
 
01:06:15.470 --> 01:06:15.480 align:start position:0%
spend it during the primary period
 
01:06:18.829 --> 01:06:18.839 align:start position:0%
no wait a minute if I I collected it for
 
01:06:21.230 --> 01:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
the primary I had the ability to spend
 
01:06:24.109 --> 01:06:24.119 align:start position:0%
the money in the primary I can't and I
 
01:06:27.170 --> 01:06:27.180 align:start position:0%
can roll it into the general election I
 
01:06:29.390 --> 01:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
can't then collect another
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
wait a minute now see now I'm gonna get
 
01:06:34.130 --> 01:06:34.140 align:start position:0%
myself tripped up so
 
01:06:36.589 --> 01:06:36.599 align:start position:0%
actually I can do that that was a bad
 
01:06:39.710 --> 01:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
example scratch that example so you can
 
01:06:42.589 --> 01:06:42.599 align:start position:0%
but if if at the end of the executive
 
01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
councils I get elected I don't get
 
01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
elected I have ten thousand dollars that
 
01:06:50.089 --> 01:06:50.099 align:start position:0%
can go into a gubernatorial fund to
 
01:06:51.890 --> 01:06:51.900 align:start position:0%
begin so when I decide to run for
 
01:06:54.650 --> 01:06:54.660 align:start position:0%
governor in two years I have the ability
 
01:06:57.710 --> 01:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
to do that that money then isn't tracked
 
01:06:59.750 --> 01:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
in the same way it's only tracked
 
01:07:02.210 --> 01:07:02.220 align:start position:0%
between the three stages of exploratory
 
01:07:04.789 --> 01:07:04.799 align:start position:0%
Primary in general
 
01:07:07.670 --> 01:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
and you can collect in the exploratory
 
01:07:10.309 --> 01:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
space you could collect fifteen thousand
 
01:07:13.549 --> 01:07:13.559 align:start position:0%
dollars from one person but you have to
 
01:07:15.470 --> 01:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
allot it so that you're only spending
 
01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
five in the exploratory five in the
 
01:07:20.930 --> 01:07:20.940 align:start position:0%
primary and five in the general
 
01:07:23.089 --> 01:07:23.099 align:start position:0%
but you and you can't collect any more
 
01:07:25.970 --> 01:07:25.980 align:start position:0%
in any of those phases from the same
 
01:07:27.770 --> 01:07:27.780 align:start position:0%
person who made that fifteen thousand
 
01:07:30.789 --> 01:07:30.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:32.990 --> 01:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
there's another thing you were you had a
 
01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.670 align:start position:0%
there's another thing you were you had a
question

01:07:34.670 --> 01:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:35.870 align:start position:0%
question
uh

01:07:35.870 --> 01:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:07:37.490 --> 01:07:37.500 align:start position:0%
you had a question but you have a
 
01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up okay
 
01:07:41.450 --> 01:07:41.460 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:07:43.490 --> 01:07:43.500 align:start position:0%
and and there are limitations as I
 
01:07:45.349 --> 01:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
understand it right now on individual
 
01:07:46.910 --> 01:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
contributions but not on contributions
 
01:07:49.490 --> 01:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
from certain kinds of committees do that
 
01:07:52.510 --> 01:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
does that disparity make sense from the
 
01:07:55.910 --> 01:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
side of enforcement
 
01:07:57.589 --> 01:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
so from the side of enforcement we just
 
01:07:59.510 --> 01:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
enforce what's in the law it's a public
 
01:08:02.690 --> 01:08:02.700 align:start position:0%
policy decision as to whether or not you
 
01:08:05.289 --> 01:08:05.299 align:start position:0%
want to allow
 
01:08:08.930 --> 01:08:08.940 align:start position:0%
on what levels you want to have for the
 
01:08:10.430 --> 01:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
ability to
 
01:08:12.829 --> 01:08:12.839 align:start position:0%
don't contribute funds from different
 
01:08:12.839 --> 01:08:19.729 align:start position:0%
don't contribute funds from different
organizations

01:08:19.729 --> 01:08:19.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:20.870 --> 01:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
01:08:22.789 --> 01:08:22.799 align:start position:0%
um we haven't really talked about this
 
01:08:22.799 --> 01:08:23.749 align:start position:0%
um we haven't really talked about this
but

01:08:23.749 --> 01:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:08:25.490 --> 01:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
um there has been a lot in the on the
 
01:08:28.809 --> 01:08:28.819 align:start position:0%
federal level issues around coordination
 
01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
between campaigns and super what's
 
01:08:35.870 --> 01:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
called super Pacs has that come up in
 
01:08:38.150 --> 01:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
any of the enforcement in any of your
 
01:08:40.970 --> 01:08:40.980 align:start position:0%
Enforcement cases do you see that here
 
01:08:44.090 --> 01:08:44.100 align:start position:0%
well we do see super Pacs they tend to
 
01:08:45.950 --> 01:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
be in the uh
 
01:08:49.249 --> 01:08:49.259 align:start position:0%
the presidential election year and in
 
01:08:51.950 --> 01:08:51.960 align:start position:0%
the midterm year elections so super Pacs
 
01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
are here
 
01:08:56.150 --> 01:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
and they contribute money do we we look
 
01:08:58.070 --> 01:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
at coordination we look at independent
 
01:08:59.749 --> 01:08:59.759 align:start position:0%
expenditures depending on what's
 
01:09:03.050 --> 01:09:03.060 align:start position:0%
occurring generally we haven't had any
 
01:09:06.769 --> 01:09:06.779 align:start position:0%
significant problems with them
 
01:09:09.709 --> 01:09:09.719 align:start position:0%
but they are here and we do what we do
 
01:09:13.249 --> 01:09:13.259 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:14.930 --> 01:09:14.940 align:start position:0%
I'd like to rephrase representative
 
01:09:16.070 --> 01:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
muirhead's question because I think what
 
01:09:18.349 --> 01:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
he was trying to get to was does the
 
01:09:20.030 --> 01:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
structure of
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
um unlimited contributions pack to pack
 
01:09:24.530 --> 01:09:24.540 align:start position:0%
transfers create the potential to get
 
01:09:27.050 --> 01:09:27.060 align:start position:0%
around the spirit of the law of our
 
01:09:28.490 --> 01:09:28.500 align:start position:0%
contribution limits is that is that a
 
01:09:30.890 --> 01:09:30.900 align:start position:0%
better way of expressing that there we
 
01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
go I don't hate that yes there we go
 
01:09:39.530 --> 01:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
so I I guess we're back to we understand
 
01:09:42.110 --> 01:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
that that's what happens with them and
 
01:09:44.749 --> 01:09:44.759 align:start position:0%
again it's a policy Choice that's why we
 
01:09:46.490 --> 01:09:46.500 align:start position:0%
in the last
 
01:09:49.249 --> 01:09:49.259 align:start position:0%
I don't know six election Cycles have
 
01:09:51.169 --> 01:09:51.179 align:start position:0%
issued letters making sure it's very
 
01:09:53.749 --> 01:09:53.759 align:start position:0%
clear how we read the election laws and
 
01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
what that means with respect to
 
01:09:57.350 --> 01:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
contributions so that the legislature
 
01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
understands that's how we're
 
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
interpreting the law if you want to
 
01:10:02.930 --> 01:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
choose to change those contribution
 
01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
levels that's fine we're happy to
 
01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
enforce them that way but it's not our
 
01:10:09.770 --> 01:10:09.780 align:start position:0%
decision as to whether or not
 
01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:18.290 --> 01:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
thank you is there any limitation to how
 
01:10:20.990 --> 01:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
much a candidate can roll over from a
 
01:10:23.209 --> 01:10:23.219 align:start position:0%
municipal election to a Statewide
 
01:10:25.610 --> 01:10:25.620 align:start position:0%
election they run for mayor of Franklin
 
01:10:28.010 --> 01:10:28.020 align:start position:0%
and raised two million dollars and then
 
01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:29.940 align:start position:0%
run for for governor could they roll it
 
01:10:31.250 --> 01:10:31.260 align:start position:0%
all over if they didn't spend it in
 
01:10:33.169 --> 01:10:33.179 align:start position:0%
Franklin yeah
 
01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
and thank you and is there but there is
 
01:10:38.570 --> 01:10:38.580 align:start position:0%
you can't roll money from Municipal and
 
01:10:40.430 --> 01:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
state elections into Federal campaigns
 
01:10:44.410 --> 01:10:44.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
answer to that question because that's
 
01:10:49.130 --> 01:10:49.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:51.590 --> 01:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
I want to follow up on that so in the
 
01:10:52.669 --> 01:10:52.679 align:start position:0%
city of Manchester we have no
 
01:10:54.830 --> 01:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
contribution limits so somebody could
 
01:10:56.390 --> 01:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
raise an unlimited money for mayor and
 
01:10:58.790 --> 01:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
then roll that into per se a race for
 
01:10:58.800 --> 01:10:59.870 align:start position:0%
then roll that into per se a race for
governor

01:10:59.870 --> 01:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
governor
 
01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:01.850 align:start position:0%
governor
Unlimited

01:11:01.850 --> 01:11:01.860 align:start position:0%
Unlimited
 
01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:04.020 align:start position:0%
back to I hate answering these questions
 
01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
in a hypothetical but right now at the
 
01:11:08.209 --> 01:11:08.219 align:start position:0%
top of my head I don't see a reason why
 
01:11:09.470 --> 01:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
they couldn't
 
01:11:12.590 --> 01:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
but it I mean I guess the question is
 
01:11:16.729 --> 01:11:16.739 align:start position:0%
yeah actually so my one caveat is in
 
01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
Municipal elections the town elections
 
01:11:22.189 --> 01:11:22.199 align:start position:0%
there are not political committees and
 
01:11:22.199 --> 01:11:23.090 align:start position:0%
there are not political committees and
so

01:11:23.090 --> 01:11:23.100 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:25.970 --> 01:11:25.980 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how those funds are being
 
01:11:28.729 --> 01:11:28.739 align:start position:0%
reported in the the city elections I
 
01:11:30.110 --> 01:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
don't know how
 
01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
how they're holding those but the the
 
01:11:34.970 --> 01:11:34.980 align:start position:0%
city elections also aren't required
 
01:11:36.350 --> 01:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
they're not a political committee so
 
01:11:48.050 --> 01:11:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:49.490 --> 01:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
I have a question
 
01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
uh one of the thoughts we've discussed
 
01:11:56.930 --> 01:11:56.940 align:start position:0%
relates to the different phases of an
 
01:11:58.450 --> 01:11:58.460 align:start position:0%
election cycle
 
01:12:01.729 --> 01:12:01.739 align:start position:0%
correct me if I get this wrong but but I
 
01:12:04.250 --> 01:12:04.260 align:start position:0%
think we can talk about exploratory or
 
01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
pre-primary phase is one and there's the
 
01:12:10.130 --> 01:12:10.140 align:start position:0%
primary uh phase and then the general
 
01:12:11.750 --> 01:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
election phase is am I getting that
 
01:12:13.550 --> 01:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
correct yes that's how we Define them
 
01:12:15.470 --> 01:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
right we've uh
 
01:12:19.130 --> 01:12:19.140 align:start position:0%
discussed the thought of just having an
 
01:12:20.990 --> 01:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
election cycle phase numbers getting rid
 
01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
of those distinctions
 
01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
and having one overall contribution
 
01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:28.020 align:start position:0%
limit which we're not talking about
 
01:12:31.370 --> 01:12:31.380 align:start position:0%
changing the overall total at this point
 
01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
so my question that's the background my
 
01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
question is with doing things with just
 
01:12:39.290 --> 01:12:39.300 align:start position:0%
one phase for the entire election cycle
 
01:12:40.729 --> 01:12:40.739 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:12:45.470 --> 01:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
make the enforcement of of things
 
01:12:48.530 --> 01:12:48.540 align:start position:0%
more effective or efficient or less so
 
01:12:50.689 --> 01:12:50.699 align:start position:0%
I'm not I understand
 
01:12:53.209 --> 01:12:53.219 align:start position:0%
that you folks enforce the policy set by
 
01:12:55.430 --> 01:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
the legislature that's and I understand
 
01:12:57.950 --> 01:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
and agree with the sense of that but how
 
01:12:59.270 --> 01:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
would that affect the enforcement would
 
01:13:01.250 --> 01:13:01.260 align:start position:0%
it make for Less confusion Maybe
 
01:13:03.770 --> 01:13:03.780 align:start position:0%
I I believe that it would make for Less
 
01:13:05.149 --> 01:13:05.159 align:start position:0%
confusion I think it would make
 
01:13:08.930 --> 01:13:08.940 align:start position:0%
reporting easier for candidates as well
 
01:13:11.930 --> 01:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
because they do have to identify and
 
01:13:15.410 --> 01:13:15.420 align:start position:0%
segregate funds in order to match the
 
01:13:19.010 --> 01:13:19.020 align:start position:0%
three phases of the process and so they
 
01:13:20.930 --> 01:13:20.940 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to do that I would say
 
01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
generally most of our candidates are
 
01:13:26.030 --> 01:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
pretty well educated on this now so it's
 
01:13:29.209 --> 01:13:29.219 align:start position:0%
much easier in enforcing the three
 
01:13:31.850 --> 01:13:31.860 align:start position:0%
phases than it was 10 years ago where
 
01:13:34.430 --> 01:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
people were constantly
 
01:13:36.290 --> 01:13:36.300 align:start position:0%
putting money in the different phases
 
01:13:39.709 --> 01:13:39.719 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't it wasn't as it wasn't as
 
01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
well understood at that time but I think
 
01:13:43.790 --> 01:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
that if you put it all together and you
 
01:13:45.770 --> 01:13:45.780 align:start position:0%
had so if you I don't know what you'd
 
01:13:47.450 --> 01:13:47.460 align:start position:0%
want to use let's just use the current
 
01:13:49.310 --> 01:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
figure so if it's fifteen thousand
 
01:13:51.169 --> 01:13:51.179 align:start position:0%
dollars and somebody can collect that in
 
01:13:51.179 --> 01:13:52.149 align:start position:0%
dollars and somebody can collect that in
the

01:13:52.149 --> 01:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:13:54.590 --> 01:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
exploratory phase as long as the
 
01:13:56.990 --> 01:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
candidates understand that as they're
 
01:13:58.610 --> 01:13:58.620 align:start position:0%
coming into the general election and
 
01:14:00.410 --> 01:14:00.420 align:start position:0%
really looking for money they can go
 
01:14:02.510 --> 01:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
back to those people who gave them 15
 
01:14:05.890 --> 01:14:05.900 align:start position:0%
000 in the beginning then uh that's that
 
01:14:08.930 --> 01:14:08.940 align:start position:0%
that you then have to have we'd probably
 
01:14:11.149 --> 01:14:11.159 align:start position:0%
have to modify the reporting Cycles
 
01:14:14.689 --> 01:14:14.699 align:start position:0%
because currently under the law the this
 
01:14:17.330 --> 01:14:17.340 align:start position:0%
each end of a cycle so the end of a
 
01:14:20.810 --> 01:14:20.820 align:start position:0%
prime the primary campaign ends 10 days
 
01:14:23.090 --> 01:14:23.100 align:start position:0%
after the primary and then you have to
 
01:14:26.209 --> 01:14:26.219 align:start position:0%
have the second committee set up for the
 
01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
general election so you'd want to do
 
01:14:30.590 --> 01:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
something where maybe you combine those
 
01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:31.550 align:start position:0%
something where maybe you combine those
two

01:14:31.550 --> 01:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:14:34.250 --> 01:14:34.260 align:start position:0%
reporting periods but they
 
01:14:37.310 --> 01:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
there that would could easily be done
 
01:14:45.890 --> 01:14:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:49.370 --> 01:14:49.380 align:start position:0%
thank you on the rolling over if I were
 
01:14:50.870 --> 01:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
to raise
 
01:14:53.570 --> 01:14:53.580 align:start position:0%
money to to run for select board and
 
01:14:54.830 --> 01:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
Hanover which doesn't require any
 
01:14:56.450 --> 01:14:56.460 align:start position:0%
reporting at all
 
01:14:59.149 --> 01:14:59.159 align:start position:0%
and then I were to run I don't know some
 
01:15:00.590 --> 01:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
sort of State campaign like for the
 
01:15:02.930 --> 01:15:02.940 align:start position:0%
legislature are there any requirements
 
01:15:05.390 --> 01:15:05.400 align:start position:0%
for the rate at which that money is
 
01:15:07.130 --> 01:15:07.140 align:start position:0%
rolled over could I just kind of drip it
 
01:15:09.229 --> 01:15:09.239 align:start position:0%
into my state campaign as needed and
 
01:15:11.890 --> 01:15:11.900 align:start position:0%
otherwise keep it in this unregistered
 
01:15:15.649 --> 01:15:15.659 align:start position:0%
unreported unlimited local you know
 
01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
account that I use to run for select
 
01:15:20.630 --> 01:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
board so so in other words I have 500
 
01:15:22.669 --> 01:15:22.679 align:start position:0%
000 in this in this account and when I
 
01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
incur five thousand dollars of expenses
 
01:15:26.149 --> 01:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
I roll five thousand into this state
 
01:15:28.729 --> 01:15:28.739 align:start position:0%
account so that you never really see how
 
01:15:34.370 --> 01:15:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:36.709 --> 01:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
elections I don't know what that thing
 
01:15:39.169 --> 01:15:39.179 align:start position:0%
is that you're holding your money in and
 
01:15:41.930 --> 01:15:41.940 align:start position:0%
so that part is concerning and would be
 
01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
concerning because I don't
 
01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:47.030 align:start position:0%
concerning because I don't
I don't even

01:15:47.030 --> 01:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
I don't even
 
01:15:48.830 --> 01:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
I assume you're not a registered
 
01:15:50.570 --> 01:15:50.580 align:start position:0%
political committee because you're not
 
01:15:52.970 --> 01:15:52.980 align:start position:0%
required to be a registered political
 
01:15:55.130 --> 01:15:55.140 align:start position:0%
Committee in Municipal elections so
 
01:15:56.990 --> 01:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
you're running a bank account of some
 
01:16:00.110 --> 01:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
type now I I say that with the
 
01:16:03.610 --> 01:16:03.620 align:start position:0%
understanding that in the case of some
 
01:16:06.410 --> 01:16:06.420 align:start position:0%
Municipal elections particularly mayor
 
01:16:09.410 --> 01:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
elections where they tend to be more
 
01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
expensive though at times those
 
01:16:14.270 --> 01:16:14.280 align:start position:0%
individuals will create political
 
01:16:16.250 --> 01:16:16.260 align:start position:0%
committees so that they have their funds
 
01:16:18.130 --> 01:16:18.140 align:start position:0%
going into a political committee account
 
01:16:21.470 --> 01:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
and they will do that and they will and
 
01:16:24.590 --> 01:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
at that point they clearly are in line
 
01:16:27.050 --> 01:16:27.060 align:start position:0%
with being able to make contributions in
 
01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
accordance with the state law with
 
01:16:31.370 --> 01:16:31.380 align:start position:0%
respect to your account that you'd be
 
01:16:33.530 --> 01:16:33.540 align:start position:0%
holding in Hanover that's got a half a
 
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
million dollars in it for your
 
01:16:36.110 --> 01:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
slackman's race and what you're doing
 
01:16:38.149 --> 01:16:38.159 align:start position:0%
with it I think that we would be having
 
01:16:40.010 --> 01:16:40.020 align:start position:0%
a lot of conversations about what that
 
01:16:42.709 --> 01:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
is and and how that's functioning
 
01:16:45.290 --> 01:16:45.300 align:start position:0%
because I'm back to I don't like to
 
01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
answer campaign Finance it questions as
 
01:16:50.570 --> 01:16:50.580 align:start position:0%
a hypothetical I'm I'm not sure what you
 
01:16:53.090 --> 01:16:53.100 align:start position:0%
could do with it but I also am not sure
 
01:16:55.070 --> 01:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
that you couldn't just contribute it all
 
01:16:58.070 --> 01:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
and I don't think and if you didn't if
 
01:17:00.110 --> 01:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
there there's no it's one of the
 
01:17:01.970 --> 01:17:01.980 align:start position:0%
challenges with Municipal elections
 
01:17:05.090 --> 01:17:05.100 align:start position:0%
there are no deadlines on anything with
 
01:17:06.830 --> 01:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
respect to what you have to do with
 
01:17:08.630 --> 01:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
those funds and how you can hold those
 
01:17:10.370 --> 01:17:10.380 align:start position:0%
funds and how you report on those funds
 
01:17:11.810 --> 01:17:11.820 align:start position:0%
because there just are no rules around
 
01:17:14.149 --> 01:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
those and for the most part it's because
 
01:17:17.390 --> 01:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
when somebody's running for
 
01:17:20.149 --> 01:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
um dog catcher or seleckman in a
 
01:17:22.010 --> 01:17:22.020 align:start position:0%
municipality they're not raising
 
01:17:24.530 --> 01:17:24.540 align:start position:0%
necessarily a lot of funds but sometimes
 
01:17:26.630 --> 01:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
in some of those elections like mayoral
 
01:17:29.630 --> 01:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
elections they may be raising a lot of
 
01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:31.970 align:start position:0%
elections they may be raising a lot of
funds

01:17:31.970 --> 01:17:31.980 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:17:37.010 --> 01:17:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:38.990 --> 01:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I have to excuse myself I
 
01:17:40.490 --> 01:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
have to take my child to uh actually
 
01:17:42.649 --> 01:17:42.659 align:start position:0%
your neck of the woods
 
01:17:44.810 --> 01:17:44.820 align:start position:0%
um so I apologize but I have to I have
 
01:17:57.770 --> 01:17:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:59.390 --> 01:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
do we have any other questions from the
 
01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:00.830 align:start position:0%
do we have any other questions from the
subcommittee

01:18:00.830 --> 01:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
01:18:02.689 --> 01:18:02.699 align:start position:0%
I mean you've been very generous with
 
01:18:04.490 --> 01:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
your time and we really appreciate it
 
01:18:07.490 --> 01:18:07.500 align:start position:0%
it's been very helpful the write-up also
 
01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
very very helpful next
 
01:18:10.669 --> 01:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
thank you we'll be
 
01:18:12.350 --> 01:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
we'll be Perry States off
 
01:18:15.350 --> 01:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
more we can do we're happy to help so
 
01:18:17.330 --> 01:18:17.340 align:start position:0%
last call for questions
 
01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
okay well thank you very very much both
 
01:18:36.890 --> 01:18:36.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:39.709 --> 01:18:39.719 align:start position:0%
Miss Hennessy is there anything you'd
 
01:18:41.149 --> 01:18:41.159 align:start position:0%
like to share with us any thoughts that
 
01:18:44.510 --> 01:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
have been stimulated by this discussion
 
01:18:47.450 --> 01:18:47.460 align:start position:0%
if if so you're welcome to share them
 
01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:55.550 --> 01:18:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:58.130 --> 01:18:58.140 align:start position:0%
good morning Erin Hennessey deputy
 
01:19:00.229 --> 01:19:00.239 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
 
01:19:03.229 --> 01:19:03.239 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair I mentioned to you not in
 
01:19:05.570 --> 01:19:05.580 align:start position:0%
this meeting that our department is
 
01:19:08.090 --> 01:19:08.100 align:start position:0%
putting together some suggested changes
 
01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
based on what we've heard you speak
 
01:19:12.169 --> 01:19:12.179 align:start position:0%
about based on what we think would be
 
01:19:15.709 --> 01:19:15.719 align:start position:0%
helpful to help clarify 664 and based on
 
01:19:18.229 --> 01:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
what the AG's office just testified to
 
01:19:21.050 --> 01:19:21.060 align:start position:0%
so I My Hope Is that we'll have this to
 
01:19:24.110 --> 01:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
you before your next meeting are you
 
01:19:26.930 --> 01:19:26.940 align:start position:0%
planning on meeting again after
 
01:19:29.570 --> 01:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
your next meeting we haven't decided yet
 
01:19:33.770 --> 01:19:33.780 align:start position:0%
okay we'll have to discuss it amongst us
 
01:19:38.149 --> 01:19:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:40.010 --> 01:19:40.020 align:start position:0%
thank you we
 
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
I think our next meeting on the 29th
 
01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh excuse me the 27th
 
01:19:50.330 --> 01:19:50.340 align:start position:0%
thank you 14 plus 13 is 27 all the time
 
01:19:53.090 --> 01:19:53.100 align:start position:0%
anyway we'll be discussing the direction
 
01:19:54.649 --> 01:19:54.659 align:start position:0%
we're taking in the future in that
 
01:19:56.570 --> 01:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
meeting okay
 
01:19:59.270 --> 01:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:20:01.790 --> 01:20:01.800 align:start position:0%
uh we have a question if you have time
 
01:20:07.070 --> 01:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:09.830 --> 01:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you received them can I
 
01:20:12.050 --> 01:20:12.060 align:start position:0%
just send you those because
 
01:20:13.729 --> 01:20:13.739 align:start position:0%
we had talked about working with the
 
01:20:15.709 --> 01:20:15.719 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State on those so I'm happy
 
01:20:17.510 --> 01:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
to send them to you sure sure that would
 
01:20:24.490 --> 01:20:24.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:26.689 --> 01:20:26.699 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time we
 
01:20:35.930 --> 01:20:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:37.490 --> 01:20:37.500 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't know how we're going to
 
01:20:39.530 --> 01:20:39.540 align:start position:0%
get this done with only one more meeting
 
01:20:41.930 --> 01:20:41.940 align:start position:0%
but miracles happen
 
01:20:46.610 --> 01:20:46.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:49.850 --> 01:20:49.860 align:start position:0%
I think if we're working on documents I
 
01:20:51.290 --> 01:20:51.300 align:start position:0%
don't think we necessarily have to have
 
01:20:53.689 --> 01:20:53.699 align:start position:0%
a meeting and I think working document
 
01:20:56.570 --> 01:20:56.580 align:start position:0%
we can share working documents without
 
01:20:56.580 --> 01:20:58.430 align:start position:0%
we can share working documents without
violating

01:20:58.430 --> 01:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
violating
 
01:20:58.440 --> 01:20:59.750 align:start position:0%
violating
uh

01:20:59.750 --> 01:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
the right to know law but yeah we'll
 
01:21:03.290 --> 01:21:03.300 align:start position:0%
make sure of that okay but we can
 
01:21:04.669 --> 01:21:04.679 align:start position:0%
discuss we can discuss that next meeting
 
01:21:07.970 --> 01:21:07.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:09.350 --> 01:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
I'm not
 
01:21:13.130 --> 01:21:13.140 align:start position:0%
adamant about how we go forward this
 
01:21:15.770 --> 01:21:15.780 align:start position:0%
uh we would like to all come up with
 
01:21:18.470 --> 01:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
something useful out of this and I think
 
01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to be able to oh I think so
 
01:21:23.270 --> 01:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
just bringing clarity
 
01:21:25.610 --> 01:21:25.620 align:start position:0%
and reducing the potential for confusion
 
01:21:31.310 --> 01:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:33.410 --> 01:21:33.420 align:start position:0%
do you know whether a subgroup like this
 
01:21:37.070 --> 01:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
is permitted to meet via Zoom
 
01:21:39.050 --> 01:21:39.060 align:start position:0%
or remotely
 
01:21:46.729 --> 01:21:46.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:50.450 --> 01:21:50.460 align:start position:0%
I know that was a you know in context of
 
01:21:52.729 --> 01:21:52.739 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
01:21:55.370 --> 01:21:55.380 align:start position:0%
uh remote meetings acquired a certain
 
01:21:57.950 --> 01:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
kind of controversiality but I think in
 
01:21:59.689 --> 01:21:59.699 align:start position:0%
this context it's I don't have a
 
01:22:01.189 --> 01:22:01.199 align:start position:0%
definitive I don't have a real opinion
 
01:22:03.169 --> 01:22:03.179 align:start position:0%
on that at this point would have to find
 
01:22:03.179 --> 01:22:08.270 align:start position:0%
on that at this point would have to find
out

01:22:08.270 --> 01:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:10.250 --> 01:22:10.260 align:start position:0%
it'd be easier to call a
 
01:22:12.169 --> 01:22:12.179 align:start position:0%
essentially a conference call if we just
 
01:22:13.729 --> 01:22:13.739 align:start position:0%
needed to quickly
 
01:22:17.090 --> 01:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
connect and not really work hard for two
 
01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:21.770 align:start position:0%
connect and not really work hard for two
hours

01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:21.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:24.590 --> 01:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
I'll do my best to find out
 
01:22:27.290 --> 01:22:27.300 align:start position:0%
well I'd like
 
01:22:30.890 --> 01:22:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:33.709 --> 01:22:33.719 align:start position:0%
and if we if we need to meet a few more
 
01:22:39.350 --> 01:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
my sense is we want to work on some sort
 
01:22:42.649 --> 01:22:42.659 align:start position:0%
of draft
 
01:22:45.950 --> 01:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
which we could exchange you know by
 
01:22:47.630 --> 01:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
email and then come together to really
 
01:22:50.209 --> 01:22:50.219 align:start position:0%
discuss it and and
 
01:22:53.270 --> 01:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
invite comment and and feedback on it
 
01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:54.530 align:start position:0%
invite comment and and feedback on it
from

01:22:54.530 --> 01:22:54.540 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:22:57.649 --> 01:22:57.659 align:start position:0%
others and so some of the work we can do
 
01:23:00.470 --> 01:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
as it were in our studies
 
01:23:01.970 --> 01:23:01.980 align:start position:0%
I'd have to we should probably all
 
01:23:06.350 --> 01:23:06.360 align:start position:0%
reread 91a I recall there was a an
 
01:23:08.870 --> 01:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
exception for working
 
01:23:10.970 --> 01:23:10.980 align:start position:0%
versions of documents but I'd have to
 
01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
reread it and would be safest if we got
 
01:23:17.390 --> 01:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
an opinion from someone whose business
 
01:23:18.830 --> 01:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:21.610 align:start position:0%
it is
should

01:23:21.610 --> 01:23:21.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:33.290 --> 01:23:33.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:34.850 --> 01:23:34.860 align:start position:0%
please come on in we would welcome your
 
01:23:34.860 --> 01:23:37.610 align:start position:0%
please come on in we would welcome your
input

01:23:37.610 --> 01:23:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:40.430 --> 01:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:46.669 --> 01:23:46.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:50.630 --> 01:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
triggering the 91a not to a quorum up
 
01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee no a quorum of the
 
01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:56.050 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee no a quorum of the
subcommittee

01:23:56.050 --> 01:23:56.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:58.550 --> 01:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
no you can't do that either because you
 
01:24:00.950 --> 01:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
you can't do it sequentially so that
 
01:24:03.010 --> 01:24:03.020 align:start position:0%
effectively it just
 
01:24:05.390 --> 01:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
I was a selectment for three years so I
 
01:24:06.890 --> 01:24:06.900 align:start position:0%
remember some of this pretty clearly
 
01:24:09.169 --> 01:24:09.179 align:start position:0%
reply all is the the sticking point
 
01:24:09.179 --> 01:24:10.330 align:start position:0%
reply all is the the sticking point
right

01:24:10.330 --> 01:24:10.340 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:24:12.950 --> 01:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
reply and then it's like whoops reply
 
01:24:15.830 --> 01:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
all is a quorum and that's has to be
 
01:24:20.270 --> 01:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
well thank you thank you very much for
 
01:24:26.689 --> 01:24:26.699 align:start position:0%
your taking the effort to come down and
 
01:24:28.370 --> 01:24:28.380 align:start position:0%
clarify this for us
 
01:24:38.709 --> 01:24:38.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:40.669 --> 01:24:40.679 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:24:42.709 --> 01:24:42.719 align:start position:0%
well there I I just took on the task of
 
01:24:44.149 --> 01:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
finding out and we just found out
 
01:24:44.159 --> 01:24:45.229 align:start position:0%
finding out and we just found out
excellent

01:24:45.229 --> 01:24:45.239 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
01:24:54.350 --> 01:24:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:58.010 --> 01:24:58.020 align:start position:0%
I can imagine Connie sending me
 
01:24:59.810 --> 01:24:59.820 align:start position:0%
and I don't mean to
 
01:25:02.689 --> 01:25:02.699 align:start position:0%
you know cast any aspersions a
 
01:25:05.030 --> 01:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
half-baked draft
 
01:25:07.790 --> 01:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
that then I would work on a little bit
 
01:25:10.430 --> 01:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
which that I could send to you
 
01:25:12.290 --> 01:25:12.300 align:start position:0%
when you could put it in your oven for a
 
01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
little while
 
01:25:15.590 --> 01:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
and send it to somebody else and then we
 
01:25:18.229 --> 01:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
could say it's been baked enough that we
 
01:25:20.209 --> 01:25:20.219 align:start position:0%
want to actually
 
01:25:22.610 --> 01:25:22.620 align:start position:0%
get together in lob and discuss it as a
 
01:25:22.620 --> 01:25:23.570 align:start position:0%
get together in lob and discuss it as a
group

01:25:23.570 --> 01:25:23.580 align:start position:0%
group
 
01:25:25.610 --> 01:25:25.620 align:start position:0%
and and so that might be a way of of
 
01:25:29.030 --> 01:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
working on it we should all read RSA 91a
 
01:25:31.430 --> 01:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
again in detail
 
01:25:33.770 --> 01:25:33.780 align:start position:0%
and then seek advice
 
01:25:39.649 --> 01:25:39.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:47.330 --> 01:25:47.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:50.390 --> 01:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
as long as it's not a quorum
 
01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
but if if you sh if this is my
 
01:25:54.229 --> 01:25:54.239 align:start position:0%
understanding from when I was a
 
01:25:57.950 --> 01:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
selectman if if you two share something
 
01:25:59.629 --> 01:25:59.639 align:start position:0%
you can you can do that because you're
 
01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
not a quorum right however if you then
 
01:26:04.550 --> 01:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
sequentially move it on to somebody else
 
01:26:07.490 --> 01:26:07.500 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that's
 
01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
kosher yeah we don't want to even look
 
01:26:12.110 --> 01:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
like we're trying to get around anything
 
01:26:14.330 --> 01:26:14.340 align:start position:0%
we all know that
 
01:26:16.910 --> 01:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
so yeah the two of you are not a quorum
 
01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:18.050 align:start position:0%
so yeah the two of you are not a quorum
so

01:26:18.050 --> 01:26:18.060 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:26:21.770 --> 01:26:21.780 align:start position:0%
you're free to discuss these things okay
 
01:26:23.510 --> 01:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
all right do we have anything else that
 
01:26:25.129 --> 01:26:25.139 align:start position:0%
we wish to discuss here as a
 
01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:30.709 --> 01:26:30.719 align:start position:0%
no I guess at some point we're going to
 
01:26:32.030 --> 01:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
have to talk about what the Senate
 
01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
Finance did but we can talk about that
 
01:26:36.890 --> 01:26:36.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:39.770 --> 01:26:39.780 align:start position:0%
yeah that was interesting yeah
 
01:26:44.570 --> 01:26:44.580 align:start position:0%
so yeah yep okay are you are you aware
 
01:26:46.129 --> 01:26:46.139 align:start position:0%
of what the
 
01:26:50.110 --> 01:26:50.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
it was the unlimited
 
01:26:55.370 --> 01:26:55.380 align:start position:0%
when they when they changed the packs to
 
01:27:00.050 --> 01:27:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:00.060 --> 01:27:04.189 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:27:04.189 --> 01:27:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:05.689 --> 01:27:05.699 align:start position:0%
I've got that you know somewhere else
 
01:27:07.189 --> 01:27:07.199 align:start position:0%
but anyway
 
01:27:09.830 --> 01:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh then if we have nothing we need to
 
01:27:11.689 --> 01:27:11.699 align:start position:0%
discuss further we can adjourn are you
 
01:27:14.330 --> 01:27:14.340 align:start position:0%
agreeable to that colleagues
 
01:27:15.950 --> 01:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
