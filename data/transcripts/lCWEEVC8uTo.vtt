00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
good morning I'm going to open up the
 
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh for the family court uh
 
00:11:57.069 --> 00:11:57.079 align:start position:0%
the special committee for the title for
 
00:12:00.509 --> 00:12:00.519 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so last week we had met or
 
00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
not last week two weeks ago we had or
 
00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
September 17th we had met and we
 
00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
discussed what we had been tasked with
 
00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
which was researching title four funding
 
00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
how much is collected how how why and
 
00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:17.079 align:start position:0%
where it goes which representative Smith
 
00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
was able
 
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
to give us a nice document that had come
 
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
from the LBA audit which showed where
 
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
all of those went it was clearly
 
00:12:30.509 --> 00:12:30.519 align:start position:0%
documented for parts a b d and e 66% of
 
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
the funding comes federally and the
 
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
remainder is through the state budget
 
00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
and the majority of all of the
 
00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:39.519 align:start position:0%
administration was through DHHS and the
 
00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:41.560 align:start position:0%
four areas where the court administered
 
00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
was establishing the uniform support
 
00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
order establishing paternity when
 
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
necessary if a party is refusing testing
 
00:12:51.069 --> 00:12:51.079 align:start position:0%
modification of uniform support orders
 
00:12:53.269 --> 00:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
every three years if a party requests or
 
00:12:55.269 --> 00:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
sooner if there was a significant change
 
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
and then show cause hearings and that
 
00:12:58.670 --> 00:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
was the the four Family Court areas and
 
00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
then in Superior Court a criminal
 
00:13:03.629 --> 00:13:03.639 align:start position:0%
nonsupport cases are through the
 
00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:05.320 align:start position:0%
superior court and those cases are
 
00:13:09.189 --> 00:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
really rare less than 10 a year we left
 
00:13:09.199 --> 00:13:10.629 align:start position:0%
really rare less than 10 a year we left
there

00:13:10.629 --> 00:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
and uh attorney bristen had offered to
 
00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:17.480 align:start position:0%
send us a lot of documentation which she
 
00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:20.120 align:start position:0%
did I passported along to everybody and
 
00:13:24.269 --> 00:13:24.279 align:start position:0%
that was where we had last left off so
 
00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:26.120 align:start position:0%
just to do a quick recap because it had
 
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:27.880 align:start position:0%
been a few weeks wanted to make sure
 
00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:31.000 align:start position:0%
we're all on the same page so now I
 
00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:32.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to see where everybody was at
 
00:13:34.269 --> 00:13:34.279 align:start position:0%
based on the documentation what we
 
00:13:34.279 --> 00:13:35.389 align:start position:0%
based on the documentation what we
talked

00:13:35.389 --> 00:13:35.399 align:start position:0%
talked
 
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
about last week I'm hoping to wrap this
 
00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
up today so that we're ready for the
 
00:13:44.269 --> 00:13:44.279 align:start position:0%
final meeting on
 
00:13:47.949 --> 00:13:47.959 align:start position:0%
10:22 which which will vote on the
 
00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:49.880 align:start position:0%
report of the entire subcommittee so
 
00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
we'll need to send our report in order
 
00:13:55.749 --> 00:13:55.759 align:start position:0%
to be able to do that so um who would
 
00:13:59.829 --> 00:13:59.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:06.910 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
ball I'm sorry I was just looking at
 
00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
some of the paperwork before could would
 
00:14:13.949 --> 00:14:13.959 align:start position:0%
we mind if we started on the other side
 
00:14:16.629 --> 00:14:16.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:18.680 align:start position:0%
please representative Smith or
 
00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:20.360 align:start position:0%
representative long do you have anything
 
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
that you wanted
 
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
to representative
 
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
W yeah I I I think we uh I think it's
 
00:14:33.269 --> 00:14:33.279 align:start position:0%
articulated well where how much comes in
 
00:14:37.949 --> 00:14:37.959 align:start position:0%
from where and where it goes um and I
 
00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:41.240 align:start position:0%
think that report itself uh would be
 
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
what the committee would
 
00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.749 align:start position:0%
what the committee would
need

00:14:44.749 --> 00:14:44.759 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
um yeah
 
00:14:51.949 --> 00:14:51.959 align:start position:0%
that's okay thank you basically it okay
 
00:14:53.389 --> 00:14:53.399 align:start position:0%
thank you representative long
 
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
representative Smith did you have
 
00:14:56.509 --> 00:14:56.519 align:start position:0%
anything you wanted to add um I I agree
 
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
with representative long um I I'm not
 
00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:03.839 align:start position:0%
sure that this topic
 
00:15:03.839 --> 00:15:05.870 align:start position:0%
sure that this topic
really

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
belongs um under the um jurisdiction of
 
00:15:15.629 --> 00:15:15.639 align:start position:0%
this special committee as it
 
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
was described to us when the committee
 
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:21.720 align:start position:0%
was formed but since it was sent here we
 
00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:24.680 align:start position:0%
did what we could I think we
 
00:15:27.389 --> 00:15:27.399 align:start position:0%
evaluated the information that came in
 
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
it seems to make sense it confirms what
 
00:15:35.069 --> 00:15:35.079 align:start position:0%
all of us know and that is that what
 
00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
happens in the family court is very
 
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
complicated very
 
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
challenging and that um
 
00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:48.920 align:start position:0%
uh as to those areas that go directly to
 
00:15:52.829 --> 00:15:52.839 align:start position:0%
the court um and
 
00:15:57.389 --> 00:15:57.399 align:start position:0%
obviously the um Department also
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:16:01.509 --> 00:16:01.519 align:start position:0%
has significant responsibilities in this
 
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
area and
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the legislative action I
 
00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:10.600 align:start position:0%
don't see
 
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
any I don't at the moment see any
 
00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
legislation which is necessary to be
 
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
proposed other than the
 
00:16:25.509 --> 00:16:25.519 align:start position:0%
general areas that we have spoken about
 
00:16:28.629 --> 00:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
overarching the fact that um there is
 
00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:31.720 align:start position:0%
not enough support for the family court
 
00:16:35.509 --> 00:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
judges to be able to carry out their
 
00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:39.160 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and we should be
 
00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.069 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and we should be
encouraging

00:16:41.069 --> 00:16:41.079 align:start position:0%
encouraging
 
00:16:46.509 --> 00:16:46.519 align:start position:0%
more um uh clerk support and other kinds
 
00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:49.720 align:start position:0%
of support for the judges so that they
 
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
can handle these CL cases
 
00:16:57.189 --> 00:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
um as well as it's possible to handle
 
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:10.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:13.549 --> 00:17:13.559 align:start position:0%
yes what was the
 
00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
perception um during testimony that
 
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
there's a reason
 
00:17:24.429 --> 00:17:24.439 align:start position:0%
why um there's a there's a reason why
 
00:17:26.429 --> 00:17:26.439 align:start position:0%
some of this comes forward is because
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
the state looks to go after the Federal
 
00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
funds is that was that a perception that
 
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
we heard through
 
00:17:37.029 --> 00:17:37.039 align:start position:0%
testimony is that the reason is that one
 
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
of the reasons why we're looking at this
 
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
so I don't want to assign motive to
 
00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
somebody else but I do believe that what
 
00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:48.280 align:start position:0%
we heard in testimony was that others
 
00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
perceived that there was an
 
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.029 align:start position:0%
perceived that there was an
incentive

00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
incentive
 
00:17:56.549 --> 00:17:56.559 align:start position:0%
for judges to make certain findings in
 
00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
order to be able to get federal funds
 
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
is I believe part of what we heard and I
 
00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
think we've now demonstrated that the
 
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:09.640 align:start position:0%
amount of money in fact that the family
 
00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:11.960 align:start position:0%
court gets from the federal funding from
 
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
title for is in fact less than 1% of
 
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:19.480 align:start position:0%
their overall budget so I
 
00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
think the data speaks for itself on that
 
00:18:31.549 --> 00:18:31.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:31.559 --> 00:18:34.070 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:18:37.789 --> 00:18:37.799 align:start position:0%
ball I believe in the testimony we heard
 
00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
um or I heard uh some concerning uh
 
00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:43.640 align:start position:0%
things that I think need to be addressed
 
00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:45.720 align:start position:0%
but I don't think they fall within
 
00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily the purview of this
 
00:18:50.909 --> 00:18:50.919 align:start position:0%
committee um so I think that something
 
00:18:54.789 --> 00:18:54.799 align:start position:0%
that um I may look into but I think that
 
00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
we need to stay within the perview of
 
00:18:58.789 --> 00:18:58.799 align:start position:0%
our assignment do you want toow
 
00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:01.400 align:start position:0%
elaborate it all so I did I did discuss
 
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
briefly with chairman Pearson just to
 
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
make sure that I was understanding the
 
00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:10.720 align:start position:0%
assignment correctly and he did say that
 
00:19:12.909 --> 00:19:12.919 align:start position:0%
if something was uncovered as part of
 
00:19:14.789 --> 00:19:14.799 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee it could be something
 
00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
that could be discussed but we
 
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
weren't I guess to be digging in on
 
00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:22.799 align:start position:0%
those areas so are you may ask if you
 
00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:25.640 align:start position:0%
referring to the garnishment of
 
00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
wages uh yes I am um that I found very
 
00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:33.320 align:start position:0%
concerning just in hearing it and then
 
00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:35.960 align:start position:0%
um what I found out after the meeting
 
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
con made me concerned about it even
 
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
more um because there still is in this
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
day a stigma attached to wage
 
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
garnishment that the parent is for no
 
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
other lack of a better word a dead be um
 
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
which is not the case and that's what my
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
concern was when I was hearing the
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
testimony that people just check a box
 
00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:02.440 align:start position:0%
and one party one who's receiving the
 
00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:04.360 align:start position:0%
money could check the box and the other
 
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
party who's responsible for paying has
 
00:20:09.669 --> 00:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
no say they're automatically put into
 
00:20:09.679 --> 00:20:10.789 align:start position:0%
no say they're automatically put into
wage

00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799 align:start position:0%
wage
 
00:20:10.799 --> 00:20:12.549 align:start position:0%
wage
garnishment

00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:12.559 align:start position:0%
garnishment
 
00:20:15.029 --> 00:20:15.039 align:start position:0%
um what I was surprised at what I
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
learned afterwards is that a person that
 
00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
has wage garnishment it could impact
 
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
their ability to get a job that requires
 
00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:25.000 align:start position:0%
security clearance and I was not aware
 
00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:28.240 align:start position:0%
of that uh when when I was listening to
 
00:20:30.549 --> 00:20:30.559 align:start position:0%
the test I just didn't like the whole
 
00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:32.360 align:start position:0%
way that that was done without having
 
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
someone say but it's my understanding at
 
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
least years ago um and um it is today as
 
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
well that if a person has a job or is
 
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
looking for a job that requires a top
 
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
secret clearance that this would
 
00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:51.400 align:start position:0%
disqualify them because of the stigma
 
00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
attached to um a wage garnishment the
 
00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
assumption is they're not making
 
00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
payments or they're having money
 
00:20:59.190 --> 00:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
problems and therefore can't be in a job
 
00:21:01.549 --> 00:21:01.559 align:start position:0%
that would require that type of
 
00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
security I was a little bit I was like
 
00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:06.440 align:start position:0%
okay well that's top secret clearance
 
00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
but then when I spoke to a local police
 
00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
officer police
 
00:21:11.909 --> 00:21:11.919 align:start position:0%
chief when I mentioned to him what do
 
00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:14.120 align:start position:0%
you think about wage garnishment and his
 
00:21:16.909 --> 00:21:16.919 align:start position:0%
immediate response was that's precursor
 
00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
in other words that person would be put
 
00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
to the end of the line I mean that
 
00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:22.360 align:start position:0%
person could get a job but they would
 
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
have to jump through so many Hoops to
 
00:21:27.669 --> 00:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
prove that this person is not a threat
 
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
um is not having financial problems or
 
00:21:32.149 --> 00:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
anything that could get in their way of
 
00:21:33.549 --> 00:21:33.559 align:start position:0%
performing their
 
00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
Duty um and that to me is extremely
 
00:21:39.149 --> 00:21:39.159 align:start position:0%
concerning and that's where I go back
 
00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
and I say that the wage
 
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
garnishment in my
 
00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:46.360 align:start position:0%
opinion needs to be shown that it's
 
00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
necessary rather than just somebody
 
00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:52.120 align:start position:0%
wants it um and I I would like to look
 
00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
into that a little bit in deeper
 
00:21:56.789 --> 00:21:56.799 align:start position:0%
detail thank you representative all
 
00:21:59.510 --> 00:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative Smith thank you I I want
 
00:22:02.909 --> 00:22:02.919 align:start position:0%
to ask you a question before I I proceed
 
00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
should we do we want to discuss this
 
00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
here or do we just want to acknowledge
 
00:22:11.789 --> 00:22:11.799 align:start position:0%
representative B's concern that she
 
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
areas so I did bring this specific issue
 
00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:22.360 align:start position:0%
up with chairman Pearson since it had
 
00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:25.400 align:start position:0%
been discussed last time and he was okay
 
00:22:28.909 --> 00:22:28.919 align:start position:0%
with the committee
 
00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
potentially making including it as part
 
00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:33.720 align:start position:0%
of their
 
00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
report but just not I guess kind of
 
00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
further going down the path of looking
 
00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
into DHHS because we're really supposed
 
00:22:48.149 --> 00:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
to focus on the family
 
00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
court I I agree with that conclusion
 
00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
that this is not a topic for this
 
00:22:56.789 --> 00:22:56.799 align:start position:0%
committee and that's why I'm hesitant
 
00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
because I don't want
 
00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
to blor an issue that I don't think
 
00:23:07.029 --> 00:23:07.039 align:start position:0%
belongs before us but I do respect my
 
00:23:09.549 --> 00:23:09.559 align:start position:0%
colleague representative all and her um
 
00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:12.760 align:start position:0%
her concerns about this I come down
 
00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:15.640 align:start position:0%
however in a very different
 
00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
place um if in fact an
 
00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
individual has
 
00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
agreed to pay child support which is
 
00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about and then does
 
00:23:35.029 --> 00:23:35.039 align:start position:0%
not and cannot present a
 
00:23:39.549 --> 00:23:39.559 align:start position:0%
reason that's acceptable as to why not
 
00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:43.240 align:start position:0%
then I believe that that person is in
 
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
violation of
 
00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:51.240 align:start position:0%
um of of a decision about child support
 
00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
and it does mean that that person's um
 
00:23:59.310 --> 00:23:59.320 align:start position:0%
financial responsibilities are are such
 
00:24:02.669 --> 00:24:02.679 align:start position:0%
that it might interfere with I'll say
 
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
his but it could be his or her um
 
00:24:09.909 --> 00:24:09.919 align:start position:0%
ability to function in a job that
 
00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:13.640 align:start position:0%
requires a high level of security or a
 
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
job such as in the police force and I
 
00:24:19.789 --> 00:24:19.799 align:start position:0%
don't think that that's inappropriate I
 
00:24:23.909 --> 00:24:23.919 align:start position:0%
do know that very few cases end
 
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
up going to the Superior Court in this
 
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
area I do know that the
 
00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
threat of um uh imprisonment let's you
 
00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
know be you is real enough to provide an
 
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
additional incentive to those people who
 
00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:50.360 align:start position:0%
might rather spend their money in a
 
00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:54.799 align:start position:0%
different way than meeting their agreed
 
00:24:58.590 --> 00:24:58.600 align:start position:0%
upon obligations to their children
 
00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
um and so the threat itself does have
 
00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
some value
 
00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
um but I think
 
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
people have to be held
 
00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:15.880 align:start position:0%
accountable um and I understand that
 
00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:17.320 align:start position:0%
there are people
 
00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
who um whose financial situation changes
 
00:25:25.029 --> 00:25:25.039 align:start position:0%
who responsibilities change and we ought
 
00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:28.120 align:start position:0%
to be able to find a way to address that
 
00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:31.640 align:start position:0%
but but someone walking away from their
 
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
children are
 
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
not honoring their obligations to their
 
00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
family and the community so I'm I'm not
 
00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:50.120 align:start position:0%
uh I think I think the problem though
 
00:25:52.389 --> 00:25:52.399 align:start position:0%
was that what was said was that even if
 
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
somebody was paying on time one party
 
00:25:57.070 --> 00:25:57.080 align:start position:0%
could still fill out the application and
 
00:25:59.149 --> 00:25:59.159 align:start position:0%
request for the wage G perishment even
 
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
if the party had always paid on time and
 
00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
that that would be approved because that
 
00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't go through Court that's just
 
00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:07.640 align:start position:0%
through DHHS and so the concern was that
 
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
somebody who's always paid on time would
 
00:26:12.149 --> 00:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
now have the wage garnishment even
 
00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
though they'd always paid on
 
00:26:17.389 --> 00:26:17.399 align:start position:0%
time I that might very well be true and
 
00:26:19.789 --> 00:26:19.799 align:start position:0%
if so that's a problem and it's a
 
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
problem that falls to the Department of
 
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services not to the
 
00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:27.029 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services not to the
family

00:26:27.029 --> 00:26:27.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:30.440 align:start position:0%
court and perhaps that can be handled in
 
00:26:33.269 --> 00:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
rules perhaps that can be handled in
 
00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
informal discussions with people in
 
00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:38.600 align:start position:0%
responsible positions at Health and
 
00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
Human Services and if necessary perhaps
 
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
it could be handled in
 
00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
legislation but not through the special
 
00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:50.600 align:start position:0%
committee on the Family
 
00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
Court thank you
 
00:27:01.029 --> 00:27:01.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
the depth of
 
00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
it um attorney Briston would you mind if
 
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
I ask you a question and it's okay you
 
00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
don't have to answer it and if you don't
 
00:27:11.389 --> 00:27:11.399 align:start position:0%
know that's okay I I'm kind of calling
 
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
you out on the spotlight here but I I'm
 
00:27:15.669 --> 00:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
wondering if you might be able to tell
 
00:27:18.269 --> 00:27:18.279 align:start position:0%
us approximately how many like what
 
00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:22.200 align:start position:0%
percentage of the cases that have wage
 
00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:25.640 align:start position:0%
garnishment are not for non-payment so
 
00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
and they're not tan up situations I know
 
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
you said approx a little less than 10%
 
00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
were tanif but do you know approximately
 
00:27:33.909 --> 00:27:33.919 align:start position:0%
what percentage are people that have
 
00:27:35.909 --> 00:27:35.919 align:start position:0%
always paid on time but somebody just
 
00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
would prefer to be paid through the
 
00:27:41.549 --> 00:27:41.559 align:start position:0%
bureau um I'm not sure I
 
00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:51.880 align:start position:0%
um the court when it issues a child
 
00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
support order um has a choice of which
 
00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%
box to check off on the uniform support
 
00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
order which is one of the many documents
 
00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:04.600 align:start position:0%
I sent to you guys um and it in it it it
 
00:28:06.909 --> 00:28:06.919 align:start position:0%
has choices between payable to the
 
00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
oblige bcss and
 
00:28:16.149 --> 00:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
other we always um encourage the courts
 
00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:20.120 align:start position:0%
to have it payable through us even if
 
00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
neither of the parties
 
00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:25.720 align:start position:0%
is wanting to go through us and then
 
00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:27.240 align:start position:0%
they can handle their child support
 
00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
between themselves
 
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
but having it payable through Us in that
 
00:28:33.549 --> 00:28:33.559 align:start position:0%
order means that if when there's a
 
00:28:36.509 --> 00:28:36.519 align:start position:0%
problem and many times there
 
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
is the um saying let's say mom is the
 
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
oblige if she needs to then get our
 
00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:46.360 align:start position:0%
services if it's payable directly to her
 
00:28:48.029 --> 00:28:48.039 align:start position:0%
she needs to go back to court and get it
 
00:28:51.669 --> 00:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
payable through us so there so it is
 
00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
required to be in the court order it's
 
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
not just that they can fill out an
 
00:28:58.509 --> 00:28:58.519 align:start position:0%
application it it so it it does relate
 
00:29:00.789 --> 00:29:00.799 align:start position:0%
to family court in the sense that if
 
00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
it's not in the uniform support order
 
00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:04.600 align:start position:0%
with the Box checked that it's payable
 
00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:05.630 align:start position:0%
with the Box checked that it's payable
through

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
bcss then the person can't just fill out
 
00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
an application to ask for your services
 
00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
for wage garnishment it has to be
 
00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:13.720 align:start position:0%
ordered through the court right then
 
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
we'd have to if it wasn't we'd have to
 
00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
go back to the court to get it ordered
 
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
that's what the notice to make payable
 
00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:22.600 align:start position:0%
process is and
 
00:29:25.149 --> 00:29:25.159 align:start position:0%
uh definitely some hoops that have to go
 
00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:26.840 align:start position:0%
that have to be jumped through to be
 
00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:29.240 align:start position:0%
able to get to to get to that point and
 
00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:31.240 align:start position:0%
generally if somebody's not paying
 
00:29:33.509 --> 00:29:33.519 align:start position:0%
that's more time where payments are not
 
00:29:33.519 --> 00:29:34.549 align:start position:0%
that's more time where payments are not
being

00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:34.559 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
made um can I ask one further question
 
00:29:40.269 --> 00:29:40.279 align:start position:0%
you said that if you encourage the box
 
00:29:42.669 --> 00:29:42.679 align:start position:0%
to be checked to be paid through bcss
 
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
and not through the party so that if
 
00:29:46.909 --> 00:29:46.919 align:start position:0%
they need help they could go through you
 
00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
but does that mean even if that box is
 
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
checked the party could still the
 
00:29:52.789 --> 00:29:52.799 align:start position:0%
parties could between themselves still
 
00:29:54.549 --> 00:29:54.559 align:start position:0%
agree that party a pays party B and
 
00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:55.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't go through you and that that
 
00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:57.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be in violation of the court
 
00:29:58.669 --> 00:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
order no
 
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
because it our our process is entirely
 
00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:05.240 align:start position:0%
voluntary so if they haven't filed an
 
00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:07.480 align:start position:0%
application we don't even necessarily we
 
00:30:09.149 --> 00:30:09.159 align:start position:0%
don't even know about the case on the
 
00:30:10.909 --> 00:30:10.919 align:start position:0%
order that it's payable through you they
 
00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:13.640 align:start position:0%
don't actually have to do it
 
00:30:16.029 --> 00:30:16.039 align:start position:0%
correct it is confusing we do get people
 
00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
who come in and like it's payable
 
00:30:18.909 --> 00:30:18.919 align:start position:0%
through you where's my money and we're
 
00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
like well you have to apply for the
 
00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.350 align:start position:0%
like well you have to apply for the
services

00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
to to get that and that's a just a
 
00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:25.880 align:start position:0%
learning thing that we have to teach the
 
00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
courts and teach the clerks so that they
 
00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:31.240 align:start position:0%
can tell people when that's up happening
 
00:30:33.669 --> 00:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for answering that so I guess
 
00:30:35.549 --> 00:30:35.559 align:start position:0%
it relates to the family court in the
 
00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
sense that they can they're the ones who
 
00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
approve the uniform support order or
 
00:30:44.509 --> 00:30:44.519 align:start position:0%
order the uniform support order and
 
00:30:47.509 --> 00:30:47.519 align:start position:0%
rather it's payable through the party or
 
00:30:49.909 --> 00:30:49.919 align:start position:0%
bcss so that would be the relationship
 
00:30:51.669 --> 00:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
with the court
 
00:30:54.909 --> 00:30:54.919 align:start position:0%
there um did you have something you
 
00:30:58.190 --> 00:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to add rep
 
00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
well before we were um given the answers
 
00:31:03.789 --> 00:31:03.799 align:start position:0%
I was going to say that my memory
 
00:31:05.549 --> 00:31:05.559 align:start position:0%
recalled that this was through the court
 
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
order because it's part of the uh
 
00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:10.360 align:start position:0%
parenting plan or the the child support
 
00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
um and it was just checking the box so I
 
00:31:15.629 --> 00:31:15.639 align:start position:0%
my memory my memory served me well for
 
00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
once and um I do still have concerns
 
00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
that and I and I totally respect that we
 
00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
do have people that do not pay and we
 
00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
need to have a formula or a way of
 
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
making sure they pay
 
00:31:31.909 --> 00:31:31.919 align:start position:0%
um but it concerns
 
00:31:34.269 --> 00:31:34.279 align:start position:0%
me that the assumption is the person
 
00:31:35.909 --> 00:31:35.919 align:start position:0%
isn't going to pay before they prove
 
00:31:38.389 --> 00:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
that they're not going to pay and um
 
00:31:39.789 --> 00:31:39.799 align:start position:0%
given that there are negative
 
00:31:41.389 --> 00:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
ramifications at least those
 
00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:44.360 align:start position:0%
ramifications should be told before they
 
00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
agree to um having the the wage
 
00:31:50.509 --> 00:31:50.519 align:start position:0%
garnished um for those people who may
 
00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
already be in a situation where the
 
00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
they're a police officer or they're in a
 
00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
a position that's bonded or some other
 
00:31:59.389 --> 00:31:59.399 align:start position:0%
position that a grain to wage
 
00:32:01.389 --> 00:32:01.399 align:start position:0%
garnishment could come back and bite
 
00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
them um because they didn't realize
 
00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
there is actually um a negative
 
00:32:10.029 --> 00:32:10.039 align:start position:0%
consequence or possible
 
00:32:12.909 --> 00:32:12.919 align:start position:0%
one yes representative Smith those are
 
00:32:15.909 --> 00:32:15.919 align:start position:0%
very good points for representative B um
 
00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:19.000 align:start position:0%
could I ask a question again
 
00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.789 align:start position:0%
could I ask a question again
um

00:32:21.789 --> 00:32:21.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:25.269 --> 00:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
if you know the box is checked but the
 
00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:27.480 align:start position:0%
parties have agreed to handle this
 
00:32:29.389 --> 00:32:29.399 align:start position:0%
without involving
 
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
you um and if one of the parties then
 
00:32:35.669 --> 00:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
applies for a
 
00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
job is the fact that that box had been
 
00:32:42.029 --> 00:32:42.039 align:start position:0%
checked something that is um
 
00:32:44.389 --> 00:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
communicated to a potential
 
00:32:46.629 --> 00:32:46.639 align:start position:0%
employer even
 
00:32:51.269 --> 00:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:53.720 align:start position:0%
themselves no I mean if we're not
 
00:32:55.509 --> 00:32:55.519 align:start position:0%
involved in it we would have no contact
 
00:32:59.190 --> 00:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
with the with the employer um unless
 
00:33:01.149 --> 00:33:01.159 align:start position:0%
we're doing a weight assignment at which
 
00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
point somebody would have had to apply
 
00:33:05.629 --> 00:33:05.639 align:start position:0%
for apply for services thank you I did
 
00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
go back to look through my personal
 
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
security clearance application and in
 
00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
that application what it the the way
 
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
that it phrased the question was if you
 
00:33:18.629 --> 00:33:18.639 align:start position:0%
had ever had your wages garnished for
 
00:33:20.269 --> 00:33:20.279 align:start position:0%
any reason so if they're not actually
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
being garnished you wouldn't have to
 
00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
check that
 
00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
box I would think I mean that's how I
 
00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:27.320 align:start position:0%
would interpret it that because it's I
 
00:33:29.149 --> 00:33:29.159 align:start position:0%
mean I think it's pretty explicit if you
 
00:33:30.549 --> 00:33:30.559 align:start position:0%
have had
 
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
them yes refall what I was told by the
 
00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
police chief is that if someone put in
 
00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
an application and they indicated that
 
00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
they have wage garnishment that the um
 
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
Police Department would in its um
 
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
vetting of the
 
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
candidate um call the spouse um call
 
00:33:51.269 --> 00:33:51.279 align:start position:0%
around find out why it's there and then
 
00:33:53.549 --> 00:33:53.559 align:start position:0%
this was also come out when they have
 
00:33:57.549 --> 00:33:57.559 align:start position:0%
polygraphs um in order to get their jobs
 
00:33:59.029 --> 00:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
but but those are the Hoops that it's
 
00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:01.880 align:start position:0%
like would does the police department
 
00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
really want to jump through those Hoops
 
00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
when there could be 15 other applicants
 
00:34:08.069 --> 00:34:08.079 align:start position:0%
behind that don't have wage garnishment
 
00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
and that they could push through um
 
00:34:13.589 --> 00:34:13.599 align:start position:0%
expedite more quickly so my concern is
 
00:34:16.349 --> 00:34:16.359 align:start position:0%
just as I said that it presents a
 
00:34:19.389 --> 00:34:19.399 align:start position:0%
situation that I would like to just make
 
00:34:22.149 --> 00:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
sure that people are aware of um and I
 
00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:24.040 align:start position:0%
did have another clarifying
 
00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:26.109 align:start position:0%
did have another clarifying
question

00:34:26.109 --> 00:34:26.119 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
um if they if they don't sign that box
 
00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
and they agree to the other but then
 
00:34:34.629 --> 00:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
someone comes in and applies for an
 
00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:41.320 align:start position:0%
situation okay so if we have a the
 
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
uniform support order is payable between
 
00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:44.069 align:start position:0%
uniform support order is payable between
the

00:34:44.069 --> 00:34:44.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:47.320 align:start position:0%
parties and then Mom comes in and wants
 
00:34:50.109 --> 00:34:50.119 align:start position:0%
our services whether she's sick of
 
00:34:53.589 --> 00:34:53.599 align:start position:0%
dealing with Dad not paying her or
 
00:34:55.069 --> 00:34:55.079 align:start position:0%
giving the check to the three-year-old
 
00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
and thinking it's cute or there's a
 
00:34:59.710 --> 00:34:59.720 align:start position:0%
Millions million different ways she she
 
00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:01.640 align:start position:0%
files an application and then the case
 
00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:03.640 align:start position:0%
needs to go back to court either through
 
00:35:06.109 --> 00:35:06.119 align:start position:0%
a notice to make payable or a change to
 
00:35:10.589 --> 00:35:10.599 align:start position:0%
the Uso to get to get it payable through
 
00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:13.240 align:start position:0%
us and at that point there's also the
 
00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
question of what the arear are if we
 
00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
start off straight off being payable
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
through us then there's then there's no
 
00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:23.560 align:start position:0%
aers um if say it takes six months for
 
00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:25.240 align:start position:0%
Mom to file an
 
00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:28.280 align:start position:0%
application she then fills out a
 
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
uh statement of rear of this is the
 
00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
money I got this is the money I should
 
00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:33.800 align:start position:0%
have gotten and then we have to give
 
00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
that to Dad and there can be a
 
00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
conversation as to what was paid and why
 
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
and that can get a little interesting
 
00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
depending on depending on the parties
 
00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
that's what I always say with regards to
 
00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:47.720 align:start position:0%
to wage assignment I totally get what
 
00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
you're saying about that is that for
 
00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
some people the the talking about money
 
00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:54.680 align:start position:0%
is the hardest thing for them and if if
 
00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
you can take the money off the table
 
00:35:59.550 --> 00:35:59.560 align:start position:0%
where money gets paid before anybody
 
00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
sees it so you don't feel it's lost
 
00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
quite so much that it it really um
 
00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:07.720 align:start position:0%
Smooths things out between the parties
 
00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
and then of course we have the we have
 
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:18.589 --> 00:36:18.599 align:start position:0%
keeping for a
 
00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
clarification um is it possible in these
 
00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:25.160 align:start position:0%
situations for the uh parties to be
 
00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
encouraged to engage in
 
00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
the online payment services right
 
00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
directly through their Banks to make
 
00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
sure that these things happen and checks
 
00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:35.240 align:start position:0%
go directly rather than going through
 
00:36:37.829 --> 00:36:37.839 align:start position:0%
you it's just tell them look if you want
 
00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
to go and you're going to pay amongst
 
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
yourself we highly recommend that you
 
00:36:43.349 --> 00:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
set it up as an automatic payment to
 
00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:46.079 align:start position:0%
make sure that we don't have you know so
 
00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
there it seems to me that there is a
 
00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
remedy in this day and age to get people
 
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
to pay automatically through their bank
 
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
and that's not saying that there's not
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
people out there who are not going to do
 
00:36:57.910 --> 00:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
that we always going to have that
 
00:37:00.069 --> 00:37:00.079 align:start position:0%
segment of the population again my
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
concern is casting such a a broad net
 
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
that we're catching people that would
 
00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
not be in that situation um but are then
 
00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
finding themselves in a in a quantry
 
00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:14.200 align:start position:0%
later oh uh using any kind of means like
 
00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:16.040 align:start position:0%
that is definitely something that's
 
00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
anticipated by the court um that's that
 
00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
other sort of box of setting up um
 
00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:25.400 align:start position:0%
automatic withdrawals checking count to
 
00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
checking count that's literally as much
 
00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
as I know about that type of stuff but
 
00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:31.400 align:start position:0%
it it's definitely something that's
 
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
that's contemplated and there are boxes
 
00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:35.480 align:start position:0%
that you check off
 
00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:38.920 align:start position:0%
about in the the law requires that that
 
00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
wage assignment be considered in the
 
00:37:43.069 --> 00:37:43.079 align:start position:0%
first instance but if the parties agree
 
00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
excuse me um you check off a box and and
 
00:37:49.109 --> 00:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
you sort of you go from
 
00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
there I'm sorry would you mind
 
00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:53.960 align:start position:0%
clarifying what you mean the law
 
00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
requires that wage assignments wage
 
00:37:58.470 --> 00:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
assignment be considered in the first
 
00:38:10.309 --> 00:38:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:37.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
collection and dispers and sorry 458 BC
 
00:38:44.109 --> 00:38:44.119 align:start position:0%
this is Roman numeral 3 Collection and
 
00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:46.000 align:start position:0%

00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
unit where the obligor is subject to an
 
00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
458b yeah is is bcss the state
 
00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:09.800 align:start position:0%
dispersement unit the state dispersement
 
00:39:14.589 --> 00:39:14.599 align:start position:0%
unit is a is a contractor of B of
 
00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
bcss that's where all the all the funds
 
00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:18.520 align:start position:0%
get are payable to the the state
 
00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
dispersed unit they've got a so off
 
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
which are not being enforced by the
 
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
department does that mean not being
 
00:39:28.589 --> 00:39:28.599 align:start position:0%
enforced by DHHS yes shall be enforced
 
00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
through the state dispersement unit
 
00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
where the obligor is
 
00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:35.480 align:start position:0%
subject to income
 
00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:38.440 align:start position:0%
withholding whether or not the obligate
 
00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
services this actually I'm sorry this is
 
00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
referring to we have
 
00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
a a different category of withholding
 
00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:54.200 align:start position:0%
that that we call non4
 
00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
D where if somebody wants just the wages
 
00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:04.309 --> 00:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
enforcement um because they want the
 
00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
recordkeeping we have we have the
 
00:40:09.309 --> 00:40:09.319 align:start position:0%
ability to to do that so basically we
 
00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
put the wage assignment in place we keep
 
00:40:13.109 --> 00:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
the records but if somebody stops paying
 
00:40:14.589 --> 00:40:14.599 align:start position:0%
somebody loses their job that isn't
 
00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
making the payments we don't
 
00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
then do any enforcement that's left on
 
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
their side of course they can always
 
00:40:25.069 --> 00:40:25.079 align:start position:0%
come back and apply for 40 Services if
 
00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:27.880 align:start position:0%
they want but we have about last time I
 
00:40:29.390 --> 00:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
checked it we had about 30 of those
 
00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:31.400 align:start position:0%
cases where they're just using it
 
00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:36.040 align:start position:0%
for um The Collection piece so this is
 
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
talking about dispersing monies uh the
 
00:40:40.829 --> 00:40:40.839 align:start position:0%
collection and the dispersement of money
 
00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
so is this law implying that if the
 
00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:47.960 align:start position:0%
order is after 1994 that it's supposed
 
00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
to go through bcss yeah I'm sorry if you
 
00:40:54.069 --> 00:40:54.079 align:start position:0%
if you if we back up one and go to 458
 
00:40:54.079 --> 00:40:55.390 align:start position:0%
if you if we back up one and go to 458
B2

00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:55.400 align:start position:0%
B2
 
00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:57.640 align:start position:0%
and it's a confusing stat statute

00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:05.160 align:start position:0%

00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
assistance for the benefit of the minor
 
00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:33.839 align:start position:0%
children the assignment shall be
 
00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:36.680 align:start position:0%
required and shall take effect
 
00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
immediately in all other case where the
 
00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
state is not paying Public Assistance
 
00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
the assignment shall be suspended by the
 
00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
court where there's an agreement by a
 
00:41:47.109 --> 00:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
written agreement between the oor and
 
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
the oige and the court approves
 
00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:52.640 align:start position:0%
it there they do put language in here
 
00:41:54.829 --> 00:41:54.839 align:start position:0%
and I haven't seen this in a while but
 
00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
just because I think technology has
 
00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:00.640 align:start position:0%
moved on um in a it talks about provided
 
00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
the court may require the establishment
 
00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:04.280 align:start position:0%
of a dedicated checking account so
 
00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
that's that type of I'll put money in
 
00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
your account so part A means that the
 
00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:12.790 align:start position:0%
your account so part A means that the
default

00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
default
 
00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:16.760 align:start position:0%
is that it goes between bcss unless the
 
00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
parties agree otherwise is that and
 
00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
that's because the statute says that 458
 
00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:25.400 align:start position:0%
B2 correct comma
 
00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
I a right
 
00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:32.440 align:start position:0%
right okay and then C goes on to talk
 
00:42:34.589 --> 00:42:34.599 align:start position:0%
about for good cause to not require
 
00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:36.920 align:start position:0%
immediate income assignment and then
 
00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a a finding as to why
 
00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
implementing immediate assignment would
 
00:42:43.109 --> 00:42:43.119 align:start position:0%
not be in the best
 
00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
interests and usually proof that the
 
00:42:47.589 --> 00:42:47.599 align:start position:0%
fact that the obligor has been paying
 
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
timely in the past is usually what the
 
00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:52.280 align:start position:0%
Court's looking for if you're if you're
 
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
at a hearing and maybe this is the first
 
00:42:56.069 --> 00:42:56.079 align:start position:0%
time they've dealt with the issue of
 
00:42:58.549 --> 00:42:58.559 align:start position:0%
Child Support
 
00:43:01.309 --> 00:43:01.319 align:start position:0%
um if Mom comes in and says yeah he's
 
00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
been paying me the you know the six
 
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
weeks it took for us to get here and I
 
00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
have no problem with you know he's going
 
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
to pay me great we check off the Box
 
00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
he's made timely payments and and we we
 
00:43:14.589 --> 00:43:14.599 align:start position:0%
go on we go on our way and is there a
 
00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:16.720 align:start position:0%
federal law that's requiring this to be
 
00:43:18.549 --> 00:43:18.559 align:start position:0%
done or is this just the way that New
 
00:43:21.589 --> 00:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does it um to your
 
00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:23.640 align:start position:0%
knowledge I'm pretty sure it's required
 
00:43:26.549 --> 00:43:26.559 align:start position:0%
by the feds to have the wage assignment
 
00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:36.069 --> 00:43:36.079 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
00:43:36.079 --> 00:43:37.630 align:start position:0%
yes okay
um

00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:37.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
so I
 
00:43:42.549 --> 00:43:42.559 align:start position:0%
guess I mean I I guess that's something
 
00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
we would have to if it's federally
 
00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:45.720 align:start position:0%
required then we can't change it but I
 
00:43:47.349 --> 00:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
guess that's something I I'd like to
 
00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
look into to see where it's federally
 
00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
required because if it's not federally
 
00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
required and we're requiring it in this
 
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
statute then we're not giving the court
 
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
the ability unless the parties agree
 
00:43:57.790 --> 00:43:57.800 align:start position:0%
we're not giving the report the ability
 
00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:59.670 align:start position:0%
we're not giving the report the ability
to

00:43:59.670 --> 00:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:44:02.829 --> 00:44:02.839 align:start position:0%
say it doesn't have to go through
 
00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:05.480 align:start position:0%
bcss and I would say
 
00:44:07.829 --> 00:44:07.839 align:start position:0%
that would be a flaw if it's not
 
00:44:07.839 --> 00:44:08.950 align:start position:0%
that would be a flaw if it's not
federally

00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
federally
 
00:44:11.470 --> 00:44:11.480 align:start position:0%
required that we're kind of tying the
 
00:44:12.829 --> 00:44:12.839 align:start position:0%
Court's hands to say it has to go
 
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
through bcss for wage garnishment and
 
00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:16.079 align:start position:0%
then the person's going to have to
 
00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:17.800 align:start position:0%
answer that on
 
00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:20.430 align:start position:0%
answer that on
their

00:44:20.430 --> 00:44:20.440 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
potential job application background
 
00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:28.200 align:start position:0%
check type of documentation I don't
 
00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
um yes representable um I do think we
 
00:44:33.589 --> 00:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
need to look at that closer because I
 
00:44:36.109 --> 00:44:36.119 align:start position:0%
recall the testimony or the the
 
00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:38.920 align:start position:0%
discussion not testimony sorry um last
 
00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
time was saying that the federal
 
00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
government only required those receiving
 
00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
tanif had to be on the system and that
 
00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:46.760 align:start position:0%
the other people it was just a matter of
 
00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
checking a box on the court order and it
 
00:44:53.589 --> 00:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
um if it's if it's federally required
 
00:44:54.829 --> 00:44:54.839 align:start position:0%
then I'm not really understanding why
 
00:44:57.670 --> 00:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
they're even checking the Box so I'm
 
00:44:59.349 --> 00:44:59.359 align:start position:0%
guess I'm a little bit conf I gu guess
 
00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:01.880 align:start position:0%
because the parties agree if they agree
 
00:45:03.549 --> 00:45:03.559 align:start position:0%
and then I was looking at the form if
 
00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
they agree and sign the form that they
 
00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
agreed otherwise the judge at the
 
00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
bottom just orders it but didn't you
 
00:45:14.349 --> 00:45:14.359 align:start position:0%
just say that basically everyone it was
 
00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
federally required well unless the
 
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
parties agree was what the what the
 
00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:23.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
um um that's what I thought I that's
 
00:45:28.349 --> 00:45:28.359 align:start position:0%
what I thought I heard then I thought I
 
00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
heard it not that way and now I'm
 
00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
hearing it back that way so I'm a little
 
00:45:34.589 --> 00:45:34.599 align:start position:0%
bit confused as to which way it's saying
 
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
where there's a written agreement
 
00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:38.440 align:start position:0%
between the obligor and oblige that's
 
00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:54.109 align:start position:0%
 
court

00:45:54.109 --> 00:45:54.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:56.480 align:start position:0%
um I mean I guess that that's something
 
00:46:07.549 --> 00:46:07.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
good I guess that's something that we
 
00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
could ask just to be checked before like
 
00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:13.960 align:start position:0%
the next meeting if that is federally
 
00:46:15.309 --> 00:46:15.319 align:start position:0%
required because that might be something
 
00:46:18.109 --> 00:46:18.119 align:start position:0%
that we want to consider just discussing
 
00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:20.680 align:start position:0%
I mean what what do you guys think is
 
00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
that if if that's not federally required
 
00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:24.440 align:start position:0%
do you think it's something worth
 
00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
mentioning in our report that may be
 
00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:38.829 --> 00:46:38.839 align:start position:0%
legislation I think that complicates um
 
00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
that well it's easily
 
00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:43.480 align:start position:0%
misunderstood uh if it's not required
 
00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
federally and we adding it in uh it
 
00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:54.520 align:start position:0%
complications do you agree
 
00:46:58.990 --> 00:46:59.000 align:start position:0%
representative Smith or have F okay
 
00:47:01.829 --> 00:47:01.839 align:start position:0%
so outside of this one unanswered
 
00:47:03.589 --> 00:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
question that we
 
00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
have does anybody have anything else
 
00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
that they feel relative to title 4 in
 
00:47:14.349 --> 00:47:14.359 align:start position:0%
the Family Court
 
00:47:16.829 --> 00:47:16.839 align:start position:0%
committee that needs to be mentioned in
 
00:47:16.839 --> 00:47:19.630 align:start position:0%
committee that needs to be mentioned in
our

00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:19.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
report and I do intend to include as
 
00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:24.440 align:start position:0%
part of our
 
00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
report the documentation that
 
00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
representative Smith found from the LBA
 
00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:33.800 align:start position:0%
because that shows us exactly how where
 
00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:36.470 align:start position:0%
because that shows us exactly how where
why

00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:47:39.309 --> 00:47:39.319 align:start position:0%
um and what I had mentioned at the
 
00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
summarized about the exact pieces those
 
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
five pieces four in Family Court one in
 
00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:51.720 align:start position:0%
Superior Court that the court deals with
 
00:47:54.270 --> 00:47:54.280 align:start position:0%
relative to title 4 just so that we're
 
00:47:56.990 --> 00:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
abundantly clear exactly I think we've
 
00:48:00.109 --> 00:48:00.119 align:start position:0%
figured out exactly you know what the
 
00:48:02.309 --> 00:48:02.319 align:start position:0%
court is doing the Court's relationship
 
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
with title 4 verse what might just be
 
00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:07.400 align:start position:0%
DHHS is piece so with all of that in
 
00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:09.480 align:start position:0%
there I
 
00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
can write something up
 
00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:19.000 align:start position:0%
um do we need to vote on specific
 
00:48:22.109 --> 00:48:22.119 align:start position:0%
language here or we've agreed to what
 
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to put in and it can just be
 
00:48:27.109 --> 00:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
submitted and then the we'll vote on the
 
00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:30.200 align:start position:0%
full report as a whole is that I could
 
00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
send it as a draft and then individually
 
00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:34.640 align:start position:0%
if anybody has input they want to give
 
00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
if I miss something that way we don't
 
00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
have a quorum outside of the meeting I
 
00:48:40.829 --> 00:48:40.839 align:start position:0%
would suggest that that's the way to do
 
00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:43.160 align:start position:0%
it you know you put the draft together
 
00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
and send it to us and if we catch
 
00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:46.430 align:start position:0%
and send it to us and if we catch
something
