00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon everyone thank you for
 
00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:56.360 align:start position:0%
coming um I will open the subcommittee
 
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
work session on House Bill
 
00:10:04.069 --> 00:10:04.079 align:start position:0%
1387 relative to revisions to the State
 
00:10:04.079 --> 00:10:05.269 align:start position:0%
1387 relative to revisions to the State
Building

00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
Building
 
00:10:05.279 --> 00:10:06.870 align:start position:0%
Building
Code

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
Code
 
00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
um and um I guess I will recognize the
 
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:19.839 align:start position:0%
this yes thank you madam chair this is
 
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:21.640 align:start position:0%
actually not a vision to the State
 
00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
Building Code it's a minor update to the
 
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
process for the building
 
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
code and
 
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
and at the hearing there were a number
 
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
of people strongly in favor the only
 
00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:39.320 align:start position:0%
person who was opposed was a person from
 
00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:41.720 align:start position:0%
the mechanical licensing board who
 
00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
didn't understand section six which
 
00:10:49.069 --> 00:10:49.079 align:start position:0%
merely added the words mechanical
 
00:10:49.079 --> 00:10:50.990 align:start position:0%
merely added the words mechanical
licensing

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
um but that's still there that was there
 
00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
um the reason for the deletions in
 
00:10:59.629 --> 00:10:59.639 align:start position:0%
section 7
 
00:11:03.629 --> 00:11:03.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:06.200 align:start position:0%
boilers that must have been 10 years ago
 
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
12 uh and that has
 
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
been instead of being a separate
 
00:11:14.629 --> 00:11:14.639 align:start position:0%
statutory Clause it's in in the building
 
00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:17.519 align:start position:0%
code and it's no longer necessary to
 
00:11:23.069 --> 00:11:23.079 align:start position:0%
have a separate um separate statute so I
 
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
haven't heard anything that says we need
 
00:11:26.949 --> 00:11:26.959 align:start position:0%
to make any amendments to
 
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
this thank you I I agree that we heard
 
00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:32.600 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
um president chair of the board I can't
 
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
remember thank you that um these issues
 
00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
that were in the repeal have now been
 
00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the codes and the
 
00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:47.839 align:start position:0%
board felt that wasn't necessary to have
 
00:11:50.389 --> 00:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
them cluttering up the laws
 
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:53.240 align:start position:0%
anymore uh does anyone else uh would
 
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
anyone else on the subcommittee like to
 
00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.949 align:start position:0%
anyone else on the subcommittee like to
say

00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:12:10.509 --> 00:12:10.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:12.829 --> 00:12:12.839 align:start position:0%
Sherman uh thank you Phil Sherman the
 
00:12:14.629 --> 00:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
chair of the building code review board
 
00:12:16.949 --> 00:12:16.959 align:start position:0%
uh we did have one minor amendment that
 
00:12:21.389 --> 00:12:21.399 align:start position:0%
we would request on line
 
00:12:24.829 --> 00:12:24.839 align:start position:0%
26 um we originally were suggesting to
 
00:12:27.829 --> 00:12:27.839 align:start position:0%
delete the U requirement that the that
 
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:29.720 align:start position:0%
the model code be publ for two years
 
00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:32.440 align:start position:0%
before we brought it Forward uh after
 
00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:34.240 align:start position:0%
consultation with some other interested
 
00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
parties we'd like to which seems to be
 
00:12:40.269 --> 00:12:40.279 align:start position:0%
more uh it encompasses more fine details
 
00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
and just takes more time to digest it
 
00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
and go through it than some of the other
 
00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:47.560 align:start position:0%
codes um gives them more time to
 
00:12:49.509 --> 00:12:49.519 align:start position:0%
understand it in fact we can't move much
 
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
faster in the year anyway because by the
 
00:12:53.949 --> 00:12:53.959 align:start position:0%
time we review it so we would suggest
 
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
that that two just be changed to a one
 
00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
but leave the leave the wording the way
 
00:13:05.189 --> 00:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:08.269 --> 00:13:08.279 align:start position:0%
okay would you care to create that
 
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:12.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment yes the um the point is that
 
00:13:15.949 --> 00:13:15.959 align:start position:0%
when it's a first issue the codes tend
 
00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
to have some bugs and we'd much rather
 
00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:20.440 align:start position:0%
have bigger richer States find the bugs
 
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
in the code than have us do it so I
 
00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
might add uh the only reason we were
 
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
were fiddling with this at all
 
00:13:32.269 --> 00:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
uh was to perhaps try and take some of
 
00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
the edge off of municipalities who want
 
00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:37.240 align:start position:0%
to adopt a later addition of the model
 
00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
codes um but given the ratification
 
00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:43.720 align:start position:0%
process that can only go so fast anyway
 
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
um so I I don't know whether that side
 
00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:49.160 align:start position:0%
of things is is as critical as it might
 
00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:51.320 align:start position:0%
be but
 
00:13:55.069 --> 00:13:55.079 align:start position:0%
anyway if the if the Board review starts
 
00:13:58.030 --> 00:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
a year after the code is published and
 
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
he really blame latent errors should
 
00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
have been flushed out by that I would
 
00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:07.399 align:start position:0%
hope okay yes I will get that
 
00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:09.839 align:start position:0%
Amendment would the subcommittee be
 
00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
agreeable to that small
 
00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.030 align:start position:0%
agreeable to that small
change

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:14:16.629 --> 00:14:16.639 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr Sherman is there anyone
 
00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
1387 all right seeing none um I will ask
 
00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
um I guess we'll take a vote just on
 
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment that we will be presenting
 
00:14:36.389 --> 00:14:36.399 align:start position:0%
to the full committee um it's a simple
 
00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
enough Amendment we can assume that that
 
00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:39.800 align:start position:0%
I'll get it
 
00:14:42.189 --> 00:14:42.199 align:start position:0%
correct all right I think I'll just note
 
00:14:44.749 --> 00:14:44.759 align:start position:0%
that um the subcommittee was agreeable
 
00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:48.920 align:start position:0%
amendment and I will declare this closed
 
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
if you give me just a moment to make my
 
00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
notes we'll get to the next bill which I
 
00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
think will be
 
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
lengthier most
 
00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:27.590 align:start position:0%
lengthier most
likely

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:42.790 align:start position:0%
 
for

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:57.590 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:33.470 align:start position:0%
 
whole

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:57.480 --> 00:18:49.029 align:start position:0%
 
room

00:18:49.029 --> 00:18:49.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
okay I'll open the subcommittee meeting
 
00:18:53.789 --> 00:18:53.799 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
00:18:56.149 --> 00:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
1059 um and this one actually is
 
00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:08.720 align:start position:0%
and I don't see representative MC
 
00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:13.480 align:start position:0%
Williams um I will recognize the sponsor
 
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
to whatever you care to speak to on the
 
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
bill okay the thank you madam chair the
 
00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
update of the building code is something
 
00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
that we do
 
00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
regularly and and this bill as written
 
00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
was what was recommended by the building
 
00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
code review
 
00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:39.080 align:start position:0%
board the decision on the energy code
 
00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
was not unanimous and that's what
 
00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:44.360 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams had a an
 
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
amendment on that due to confusion I
 
00:19:49.029 --> 00:19:49.039 align:start position:0%
thought I was presenting but was
 
00:19:54.549 --> 00:19:54.559 align:start position:0%
actually she had it but in any event the
 
00:19:59.470 --> 00:19:59.480 align:start position:0%
we should update the date of the board
 
00:20:02.669 --> 00:20:02.679 align:start position:0%
meeting for ratification of amendments
 
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
which is on line nine right and 10
 
00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:09.880 align:start position:0%
because some amendments were were
 
00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:13.720 align:start position:0%
adopted in dece in January
 
00:20:18.029 --> 00:20:18.039 align:start position:0%
actually um the question of
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
the energy code is the the only real
 
00:20:25.789 --> 00:20:25.799 align:start position:0%
issue as far as I can tell there were
 
00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
some minor questions that some people
 
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
had but for the most part the only issue
 
00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
is the updated the energy
 
00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.430 align:start position:0%
is the updated the energy
code

00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
code
 
00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:40.600 align:start position:0%
and uh that code
 
00:20:43.029 --> 00:20:43.039 align:start position:0%
is significantly different from the
 
00:20:47.909 --> 00:20:47.919 align:start position:0%
current code and it is
 
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
um well it reduces energy use it
 
00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
increases the cost of
 
00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
building uh commercial buildings and
 
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:01.640 align:start position:0%
houses es and it was there I think that
 
00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:03.640 align:start position:0%
was why the the building code review
 
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:05.240 align:start position:0%
board rejected
 
00:21:10.149 --> 00:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
it thank you so um I will entertain a
 
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:13.640 align:start position:0%
motion to adopt Amendment
 
00:21:17.669 --> 00:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
0146 which is the one that just updates
 
00:21:21.269 --> 00:21:21.279 align:start position:0%
the dates so that we can start with that
 
00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
um is there anyone who had an objection
 
00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:27.640 align:start position:0%
to just changing the dates that um this
 
00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
would be ratified
 
00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:35.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:38.669 --> 00:21:38.679 align:start position:0%
right any discussion by other members of
 
00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee no all those in favor I
 
00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:50.120 align:start position:0%
adopted four to
 
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
nothing now we'll get down to the
 
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
nitty-gritty um we understand that the
 
00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
the basic uh issues that we heard with
 
00:22:06.149 --> 00:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
the bill were the adoption of the 2021
 
00:22:09.149 --> 00:22:09.159 align:start position:0%
energy codes and I know there were many
 
00:22:11.789 --> 00:22:11.799 align:start position:0%
people who spoke both in favor and
 
00:22:17.149 --> 00:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
against um I do not have privy to the uh
 
00:22:20.029 --> 00:22:20.039 align:start position:0%
Pink cards that we used at the hearing
 
00:22:22.909 --> 00:22:22.919 align:start position:0%
but um I recognize several of the folks
 
00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
here who spoke for and against uh I will
 
00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:30.200 align:start position:0%
first re uh recognize Mr Sherman to
 
00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:42.640 align:start position:0%
board thank you madam chairman and
 
00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
members of the subcommittee are we
 
00:22:46.549 --> 00:22:46.559 align:start position:0%
talking only about the amendment or are
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:00.310 align:start position:0%
 
point

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:13.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
yeah just quick question um there was a
 
00:23:19.269 --> 00:23:19.279 align:start position:0%
second amendment that was supposedly
 
00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
drafted do we have access to that
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.390 align:start position:0%
 
further

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:23:30.149 --> 00:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
all that really did was change the
 
00:23:32.789 --> 00:23:32.799 align:start position:0%
energy code date from 2018 to
 
00:23:42.149 --> 00:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
yeah it's included includes the energy
 
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
codes in the bill Amendment
 
00:23:51.789 --> 00:23:51.799 align:start position:0%
1055 uh
 
00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:55.400 align:start position:0%
which is the basis of the contention
 
00:23:58.990 --> 00:23:59.000 align:start position:0%
because the board actually did not vote
 
00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:03.919 align:start position:0%
to adopt those am I correct with that
 
00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:07.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:13.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
amendment we're not going to go into
 
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
taking public testimony again that we
 
00:24:20.669 --> 00:24:20.679 align:start position:0%
already heard are
 
00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
we no I I would say not I think um it's
 
00:24:30.149 --> 00:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
not a bad idea though to just
 
00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:35.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.510 align:start position:0%
 
articulated

00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
articulated
 
00:24:40.149 --> 00:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
y I'd like to suggest that we should
 
00:24:42.389 --> 00:24:42.399 align:start position:0%
hear from the building cone review board
 
00:24:45.549 --> 00:24:45.559 align:start position:0%
as to why they did not adopt the energy
 
00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
code because I think that will influence
 
00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:48.789 align:start position:0%
code because I think that will influence
our

00:24:48.789 --> 00:24:48.799 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:24:52.149 --> 00:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
deliberations yes I I agree um however
 
00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
like I said I think we should have at
 
00:24:58.389 --> 00:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
least one person who was opposed um
 
00:24:59.950 --> 00:24:59.960 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.750 align:start position:0%
to the
non-adoption

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
non-adoption
 
00:25:08.029 --> 00:25:08.039 align:start position:0%
speak so Mr Sherman thank you uh so the
 
00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
statement that the the vote was not
 
00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:13.240 align:start position:0%
unanimous is true the vote was nine to4
 
00:25:14.909 --> 00:25:14.919 align:start position:0%
uh which is not unanimous but it was
 
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
also not very close uh that came
 
00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
subsequent to numerous subcommittee
 
00:25:24.269 --> 00:25:24.279 align:start position:0%
meetings we had several of our members
 
00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:26.600 align:start position:0%
um and unlike most of these committee
 
00:25:28.789 --> 00:25:28.799 align:start position:0%
meetings it was the most open there was
 
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
a big table and everybody was sitting at
 
00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:33.919 align:start position:0%
that table uh it was an informal
 
00:25:35.909 --> 00:25:35.919 align:start position:0%
discussion and everybody was heard that
 
00:25:39.269 --> 00:25:39.279 align:start position:0%
wanted to be heard many times uh so
 
00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
working through that process through
 
00:25:42.909 --> 00:25:42.919 align:start position:0%
numerous meetings and into the board
 
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
with a public hearing and then our you
 
00:25:48.269 --> 00:25:48.279 align:start position:0%
know slightly more formal uh a hearing
 
00:25:52.029 --> 00:25:52.039 align:start position:0%
on that um the decision was simply that
 
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
the arguments against updating the
 
00:25:58.190 --> 00:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
energy code prevailed again with a vote
 
00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
of nine to4 um it's hard to read the
 
00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
crystal ball with 17 people voting there
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
were a few less than that at that
 
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
meeting as to why uh but the discussions
 
00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
I think generally fell along the lines
 
00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
of upfront cost versus what I'll call
 
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
societal benefits and payback
 
00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
Downstream um and I think as you heard
 
00:26:23.149 --> 00:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
the testimony and I'm getting my bills
 
00:26:24.669 --> 00:26:24.679 align:start position:0%
confused here because some of the same
 
00:26:27.789 --> 00:26:27.799 align:start position:0%
testimony was at multiple bills uh one
 
00:26:31.549 --> 00:26:31.559 align:start position:0%
of the problems is that the money from
 
00:26:34.669 --> 00:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
The Upfront cost does not go to the same
 
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
person or come from the same person that
 
00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:41.320 align:start position:0%
the payback later comes from um so when
 
00:26:43.389 --> 00:26:43.399 align:start position:0%
we look at things all from affordable
 
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
housing on up to Industrial and
 
00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:47.320 align:start position:0%
University and every other kind of
 
00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:49.880 align:start position:0%
building uh payback is fine but it's
 
00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:52.840 align:start position:0%
only fine if you build a building so
 
00:26:55.149 --> 00:26:55.159 align:start position:0%
there seems to be little dispute that
 
00:26:57.789 --> 00:26:57.799 align:start position:0%
The Upfront cost increases there's 's
 
00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:00.760 align:start position:0%
lots of dispute by how much um
 
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
everybody's got a study uh but I think
 
00:27:06.269 --> 00:27:06.279 align:start position:0%
that was the General drift of the of the
 
00:27:10.149 --> 00:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
discussions um I'm also aware that the
 
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
next jump we're going to the we're
 
00:27:16.389 --> 00:27:16.399 align:start position:0%
looking at the 2021 codes today the 2024
 
00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
energy code is held up at the national
 
00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
level with a bunch of appeals but when
 
00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:25.480 align:start position:0%
that comes out um my understanding is
 
00:27:28.149 --> 00:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
that it will be a significant jump
 
00:27:31.549 --> 00:27:31.559 align:start position:0%
um the word Net Zero is floating around
 
00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
um and that has big connotations for
 
00:27:38.149 --> 00:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
building construction so I believe and I
 
00:27:40.029 --> 00:27:40.039 align:start position:0%
I really hesitate to put words in
 
00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
somebody else's mouth but I believe that
 
00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:45.240 align:start position:0%
there are those who are saying watch out
 
00:27:47.509 --> 00:27:47.519 align:start position:0%
with this jump because the next jump
 
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
becomes even bigger um but that again is
 
00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
my reading of a crystal ball that's a
 
00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:55.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:59.590 --> 00:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
cloudy what I would hope I just keep
 
00:28:02.549 --> 00:28:02.559 align:start position:0%
repeating this so forgive me is that
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
both sides of this discussion remember
 
00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
that for 20-some years now the state of
 
00:28:11.029 --> 00:28:11.039 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has created modified
 
00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
improved a process to update the codes
 
00:28:18.269 --> 00:28:18.279 align:start position:0%
um if we crash the process while
 
00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:20.440 align:start position:0%
somebody holds out to get exactly what
 
00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:21.149 align:start position:0%
somebody holds out to get exactly what
they

00:28:21.149 --> 00:28:21.159 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
want we don't get anywhere so there are
 
00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:26.600 align:start position:0%
some benefits to new codes that don't
 
00:28:28.389 --> 00:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
cost a lot of money in fact there are
 
00:28:31.549 --> 00:28:31.559 align:start position:0%
some permissive things um but staying up
 
00:28:33.389 --> 00:28:33.399 align:start position:0%
to date with some of this stuff is good
 
00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:35.960 align:start position:0%
in and of itself just with technology
 
00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:38.480 align:start position:0%
and other things so I would hope that
 
00:28:40.389 --> 00:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
that somehow we find a way through this
 
00:28:42.389 --> 00:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
without bogging everything down and we
 
00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
don't get
 
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
anything so thank you thank you one of
 
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
the uh issues that I heard over and over
 
00:28:54.269 --> 00:28:54.279 align:start position:0%
uh at the quite lengthy hearing on this
 
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
subject was um bringing the these codes
 
00:29:01.149 --> 00:29:01.159 align:start position:0%
in for commercial rather than
 
00:29:03.389 --> 00:29:03.399 align:start position:0%
residential and I'm wondering if there's
 
00:29:08.389 --> 00:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
any way that um those two parts could be
 
00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:12.440 align:start position:0%
separated uh in an amendment um what
 
00:29:14.269 --> 00:29:14.279 align:start position:0%
would be your feeling on
 
00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
that let me outline uh just in case
 
00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:20.200 align:start position:0%
everybody's not um home reading these
 
00:29:23.549 --> 00:29:23.559 align:start position:0%
codes every night uh the international
 
00:29:25.909 --> 00:29:25.919 align:start position:0%
energy conservation code basically is
 
00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:28.600 align:start position:0%
two codes Bound in a sing single book
 
00:29:31.549 --> 00:29:31.559 align:start position:0%
there's one portion of that that applies
 
00:29:35.509 --> 00:29:35.519 align:start position:0%
to uh residential buildings up to three
 
00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
stories and the state of New Hampshire
 
00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:40.440 align:start position:0%
through our amendments has expanded that
 
00:29:43.389 --> 00:29:43.399 align:start position:0%
to all buildings up to three stories
 
00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:46.760 align:start position:0%
offices shops whatever it may be um and
 
00:29:48.509 --> 00:29:48.519 align:start position:0%
there's a square footage limit on that
 
00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
so smaller buildings can be built to
 
00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
those presumably relaxed residential
 
00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
standards and then the other part of
 
00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:57.320 align:start position:0%
that we refer to as the commercial SE
 
00:29:59.310 --> 00:29:59.320 align:start position:0%
section just applies to everything else
 
00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:01.720 align:start position:0%
so the larger stuff so think about it
 
00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:03.880 align:start position:0%
with apartment buildings where at three
 
00:30:05.789 --> 00:30:05.799 align:start position:0%
stories you're in this code and at four
 
00:30:08.509 --> 00:30:08.519 align:start position:0%
stories you're in that code the
 
00:30:10.389 --> 00:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
residential code the international
 
00:30:13.389 --> 00:30:13.399 align:start position:0%
residential code which in an idealized
 
00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:15.640 align:start position:0%
form is supposed to be a single place to
 
00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:18.440 align:start position:0%
go for building a house one and two
 
00:30:21.909 --> 00:30:21.919 align:start position:0%
family dwellings and most town houses
 
00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:25.480 align:start position:0%
are built that way um has a chapter on
 
00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:28.360 align:start position:0%
energy series of chapters on energy
 
00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:31.640 align:start position:0%
which basically mirror the residential
 
00:30:34.509 --> 00:30:34.519 align:start position:0%
portion of the commercial code as far as
 
00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
I can tell they are word for word the
 
00:30:40.149 --> 00:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
same um we have some amendments that get
 
00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
that a little bit out of sync but the
 
00:30:44.669 --> 00:30:44.679 align:start position:0%
principle is there so our proposal under
 
00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
the base bill is that we delete that
 
00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
chapter out of the residential code
 
00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
because the residential code is going to
 
00:30:53.669 --> 00:30:53.679 align:start position:0%
go to the 2021 Edition and that we
 
00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
simply say go see the energy code which
 
00:30:58.269 --> 00:30:58.279 align:start position:0%
would still be the 18
 
00:31:02.029 --> 00:31:02.039 align:start position:0%
addition now if we slice the energy code
 
00:31:04.909 --> 00:31:04.919 align:start position:0%
in half and we try and keep all the
 
00:31:07.029 --> 00:31:07.039 align:start position:0%
residential stuff because three-story
 
00:31:09.509 --> 00:31:09.519 align:start position:0%
Apartments probably covers a very large
 
00:31:12.029 --> 00:31:12.039 align:start position:0%
fraction of apartment buildings if we
 
00:31:16.629 --> 00:31:16.639 align:start position:0%
try and keep that all on 2018 and take
 
00:31:16.639 --> 00:31:17.830 align:start position:0%
try and keep that all on 2018 and take
the

00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
2021 um I suspect we would not want to
 
00:31:23.389 --> 00:31:23.399 align:start position:0%
copy over all that ink in an amendment
 
00:31:24.909 --> 00:31:24.919 align:start position:0%
which means people would then have to go
 
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
to two different books not the worst
 
00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:29.720 align:start position:0%
thing in the world uh we do that with
 
00:31:31.669 --> 00:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
electrical now we've taken that chapter
 
00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:33.320 align:start position:0%
out of the residential code and make
 
00:31:35.629 --> 00:31:35.639 align:start position:0%
them go look at the electrical code so
 
00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:38.440 align:start position:0%
it's it's doable uh there might be some
 
00:31:41.669 --> 00:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
groaning but I think it's doable um and
 
00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:43.240 align:start position:0%
maybe that's what it takes to make this
 
00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
know we we would ask for the opportunity
 
00:31:58.629 --> 00:31:58.639 align:start position:0%
to put our our thinking caps on and
 
00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:01.000 align:start position:0%
check the wording and see if we can get
 
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.310 align:start position:0%
check the wording and see if we can get
it

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
correct one last thing I do have a
 
00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:10.360 align:start position:0%
couple of comments on the base bill so
 
00:32:11.909 --> 00:32:11.919 align:start position:0%
when you get back to that don't don't
 
00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:14.440 align:start position:0%
forget me
 
00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:18.350 align:start position:0%
forget me
please

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
y so when you talk about the difference
 
00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:23.320 align:start position:0%
between residential and
 
00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:26.440 align:start position:0%
Commercial and basically the cut off is
 
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:32.509 --> 00:32:32.519 align:start position:0%
four stories or larger square footage
 
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
yeah so any affordable housing four
 
00:32:37.389 --> 00:32:37.399 align:start position:0%
stories or more would be going with the
 
00:32:39.669 --> 00:32:39.679 align:start position:0%
commercial code which would be much more
 
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
Pro I won't say would be possibility to
 
00:32:46.269 --> 00:32:46.279 align:start position:0%
be more expensive to complete that
 
00:32:48.669 --> 00:32:48.679 align:start position:0%
project would be
 
00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:51.080 align:start position:0%
likely more expensive to complete the
 
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
part project 2018 to
 
00:33:01.389 --> 00:33:01.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:04.120 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire yes thank you on
 
00:33:07.789 --> 00:33:07.799 align:start position:0%
that topic I was told that many of the
 
00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:11.480 align:start position:0%
subsidized affordable housing projects
 
00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:13.029 align:start position:0%
subsidized affordable housing projects
are

00:33:13.029 --> 00:33:13.039 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
um or have Federal requirements that
 
00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
they go to the later energy code and I
 
00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:22.760 align:start position:0%
which as the buyer and the Builder as as
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
the buyer of the building they have that
 
00:33:27.509 --> 00:33:27.519 align:start position:0%
right even even if it were three
 
00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:29.320 align:start position:0%
stories and
 
00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:31.880 align:start position:0%
small I'll resist the temptation to
 
00:33:33.629 --> 00:33:33.639 align:start position:0%
weigh in on that I I don't know the
 
00:33:37.789 --> 00:33:37.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
that all right thank you very much um
 
00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:42.669 align:start position:0%
that all right thank you very much um
and

00:33:42.669 --> 00:33:42.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:46.909 --> 00:33:46.919 align:start position:0%
I we had so many people um talking for
 
00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
and against but um I felt that U Mr
 
00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
beamus probably
 
00:33:58.710 --> 00:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
expressed um the the folks that were
 
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
supporting of the energy codes more than
 
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
anyone else and I see him here and I'm
 
00:34:07.029 --> 00:34:07.039 align:start position:0%
wondering if you would be willing to
 
00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
opinions thank you for having me and
 
00:34:22.149 --> 00:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
allowing me to testify uh Paul beus my
 
00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:25.720 align:start position:0%
background is uh energy related
 
00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:27.320 align:start position:0%
activities I'm a mechanical engineer
 
00:34:29.950 --> 00:34:29.960 align:start position:0%
electrical engineer and also have been
 
00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
involved with ashray I'm the chapter
 
00:34:34.149 --> 00:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
president for granite state ashray
 
00:34:35.869 --> 00:34:35.879 align:start position:0%
ashray is the organization that does the
 
00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
research behind the codes so they're
 
00:34:41.149 --> 00:34:41.159 align:start position:0%
upfront they lead with respect to the
 
00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:43.720 align:start position:0%
science and understanding the impact of
 
00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
these various
 
00:34:48.589 --> 00:34:48.599 align:start position:0%
codes so the 2021 energy code focuses
 
00:34:50.109 --> 00:34:50.119 align:start position:0%
primarily on a couple of different
 
00:34:53.470 --> 00:34:53.480 align:start position:0%
issues um insulation being a big one
 
00:34:55.950 --> 00:34:55.960 align:start position:0%
particularly ceiling insulation going to
 
00:34:59.030 --> 00:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
a higher level of our value in the
 
00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:02.680 align:start position:0%
ceiling also the walls and Vapor
 
00:35:05.069 --> 00:35:05.079 align:start position:0%
Barrier so there's a number of reasons
 
00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
why this is very important um and I'll
 
00:35:09.829 --> 00:35:09.839 align:start position:0%
just start with Energy
 
00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
Efficiency um you know a lot of the heat
 
00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:15.400 align:start position:0%
we generate predominantly through fossil
 
00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:19.480 align:start position:0%
fuels today goes out the chimney um
 
00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
generally on an older system that tends
 
00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
to be about 60% efficient so you're
 
00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
losing 40 about 40% of the energy
 
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
for each dollar you spend on energy goes
 
00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
right out the chimney fossil fuel
 
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
system uh we are moving towards
 
00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:39.160 align:start position:0%
electrification through the use of heat
 
00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
pumps a heat pump is a device that is
 
00:35:44.589 --> 00:35:44.599 align:start position:0%
much more efficient than that for every
 
00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:47.320 align:start position:0%
unit of energy you put into a heat pump
 
00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
uh you get four uh times the amount of
 
00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
heat moved by it it doesn't generate
 
00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:56.440 align:start position:0%
heat it just moves it when you're cool
 
00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
in side it brings heat from the outside
 
00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
in and when you're hot inside it takes
 
00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
heat and puts it back out they are
 
00:36:06.109 --> 00:36:06.119 align:start position:0%
generally a factor of at least four
 
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
times as much as 12 times more
 
00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
efficient however in order to make them
 
00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
work effectively in our homes the homes
 
00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:15.880 align:start position:0%
need to be well insulated and we need to
 
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
have a proper Vapor Barrier both are
 
00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
addressed in the 2021 codes this gets to
 
00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
an issue of human Comfort uh human
 
00:36:25.829 --> 00:36:25.839 align:start position:0%
Comfort is something that can be
 
00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
Quantified we know it when we feel it uh
 
00:36:32.069 --> 00:36:32.079 align:start position:0%
relative humidity generally 40 to
 
00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
60% below
 
00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
40% uh human health begins to
 
00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
degrade we get colds quicker uh this is
 
00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:42.440 align:start position:0%
because our upper respiratory system
 
00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
becomes more susceptible to Airborne
 
00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
pathogens and because the Airborne
 
00:36:49.829 --> 00:36:49.839 align:start position:0%
pathogens float because they're lighter
 
00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:52.200 align:start position:0%
because they're drier due to the low
 
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
relative humidity this is true for
 
00:36:57.349 --> 00:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
covid-19 it's true for RSV it's true for
 
00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:00.680 align:start position:0%
the common cold so maintaining proper
 
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
relative humidity in a building is
 
00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:04.280 align:start position:0%
extremely important to human health and
 
00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
human Comfort that's the vapor barrier
 
00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
Vapor Barrier is addressed it in the
 
00:37:12.109 --> 00:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
2021 code similarly insulation is
 
00:37:14.829 --> 00:37:14.839 align:start position:0%
important to keep a an even what is
 
00:37:17.069 --> 00:37:17.079 align:start position:0%
called a thermal gradient and even
 
00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:19.480 align:start position:0%
temperature in the room many of us in
 
00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:21.240 align:start position:0%
our homes or apartments that we live in
 
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
know that there's a cold section near
 
00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
the window or a cold section in the
 
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
house in the winter time and likewise
 
00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:30.680 align:start position:0%
it's a hot one usually near the ceiling
 
00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
in the winter time having proper
 
00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
insulation allows you to maintain an
 
00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:36.680 align:start position:0%
even thermal gradient throughout the
 
00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:39.880 align:start position:0%
home so the temperature Remains the Same
 
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
and that is a human Comfort
 
00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:44.440 align:start position:0%
issue so from an Energy Efficiency point
 
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
of view we're looking at the opportunity
 
00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
to improve our Energy Efficiency in
 
00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
these buildings by as I set a factor of
 
00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
from anywhere from 4 to 8 using heat
 
00:37:55.309 --> 00:37:55.319 align:start position:0%
pump kind of
 
00:37:58.270 --> 00:37:58.280 align:start position:0%
Technology however to achieve the human
 
00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:00.520 align:start position:0%
comfort factor you have to have proper
 
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
insulation and proper Vapor Barrier
 
00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:05.720 align:start position:0%
these are both addressed in the 20121
 
00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
codes it does cost a little more to do
 
00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
this but you generally make up for that
 
00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
quickly during the operation of the
 
00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
building over its life cycle which we
 
00:38:18.349 --> 00:38:18.359 align:start position:0%
hope to be in the range of 50 years uh
 
00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
generally you make it back in a range of
 
00:38:23.589 --> 00:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
four to five maybe six years depending
 
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
upon the
 
00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
situation furthermore the value of the
 
00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
home actually goes up a recent study by
 
00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
um Fanny May showing 2.7 on average perc
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
value increase on the home for Energy
 
00:38:40.309 --> 00:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
Efficiency that number is even greater
 
00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:42.760 align:start position:0%
goes up to about 7% when comparing to an
 
00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
older piece of building stock so new
 
00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
home to new home one more efficient than
 
00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
the other generally about 3% compared to
 
00:38:54.069 --> 00:38:54.079 align:start position:0%
an older home upwards of 7% so the value
 
00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
of the home increases with Energy
 
00:38:58.829 --> 00:38:58.839 align:start position:0%
Efficiency as well well so we have human
 
00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:01.240 align:start position:0%
health a positive in outcome we have
 
00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
lower cost of energy we have of course
 
00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
lower carbon contribution the building
 
00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
sector alone which is generally referred
 
00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
to as the built segment or the built
 
00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:14.440 align:start position:0%
housing sector uh contributes to about
 
00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
40% of emissions for carbon dioxide
 
00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
worldwide a dominant percentage of that
 
00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:21.109 align:start position:0%
worldwide a dominant percentage of that
is

00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
heating um we use mostly fossil fuels
 
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
here in this region to heat our homes
 
00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
very inefficient way to do it it's also
 
00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:33.720 align:start position:0%
quite hazardous uh fossil fuel as you're
 
00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
probably aware when it's not combusted
 
00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
completely has the byproducts of carbon
 
00:39:41.349 --> 00:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
monoxide so we have to vent it and that
 
00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
means a hole in the roof in which heat
 
00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
goes out heat that would be used to heat
 
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
your home furthermore fossil fuels
 
00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:50.680 align:start position:0%
cannot cool your home it can only heat
 
00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
it uh the benefit of a heat pump again
 
00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
is we're getting off subject here thank
 
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
you yes I I agree I would um urge you to
 
00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
I understand that you have a pretty
 
00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
strong background in uh cost versus
 
00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
returns and I think that would be more
 
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
important for you to address U those
 
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
differences between the 2018 energy
 
00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
codes and the proposed 21 energy codes
 
00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
if you could address that yes I
 
00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:24.640 align:start position:0%
apologize I was just trying to give you
 
00:40:28.309 --> 00:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
context uh 21 code is predominantly
 
00:40:31.349 --> 00:40:31.359 align:start position:0%
insulation and Vapor Barrier extremely
 
00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:33.880 align:start position:0%
important for transitioning away from
 
00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel to electrification which is
 
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
uh what we have to do both in terms of
 
00:40:44.069 --> 00:40:44.079 align:start position:0%
economics and in terms of carbon
 
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
emission the cost is not generally that
 
00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:50.670 align:start position:0%
emission the cost is not generally that
high

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:50.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
question thank you very much for joining
 
00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
us today um are there any other
 
00:40:58.510 --> 00:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative
 
00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
McGuire yes thank you is there anything
 
00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
in the 2018 code that prohibits the use
 
00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
of heat pumps V vapor barriers or more
 
00:41:11.109 --> 00:41:11.119 align:start position:0%
insulation than the
 
00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:14.440 align:start position:0%
minimum uh technically there is not but
 
00:41:18.069 --> 00:41:18.079 align:start position:0%
you won't have a a very comfortable
 
00:41:20.109 --> 00:41:20.119 align:start position:0%
environment I mean you can put a heat
 
00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
pump in uh many people are doing that
 
00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
today but what they're finding is if the
 
00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:28.280 align:start position:0%
build is not insulated to the level
 
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
described in the 2021 code by the proper
 
00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
Vapor Barrier that it's not that
 
00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:37.800 align:start position:0%
effective as it would be
 
00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
otherwise any other y representative
 
00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you madam
 
00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
chair you talk about updating to 2021 as
 
00:41:51.309 --> 00:41:51.319 align:start position:0%
an increased Health factor and better
 
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
for your health and whatnot my question
 
00:41:58.270 --> 00:41:58.280 align:start position:0%
is at what point the make a house too
 
00:42:01.589 --> 00:42:01.599 align:start position:0%
tight with today's synthetics and rugs
 
00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
and furniture and everything else where
 
00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
you don't get that air exchange and
 
00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:08.440 align:start position:0%
being in a house that's too tight
 
00:42:10.589 --> 00:42:10.599 align:start position:0%
because I've seen studies out there as
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
well that show that too tight of a house
 
00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:13.790 align:start position:0%
well that show that too tight of a house
causes

00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
causes
 
00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:16.040 align:start position:0%
problems the way they address that is
 
00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:18.280 align:start position:0%
through energy recovery ventilation it's
 
00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
a device that you put in the home that
 
00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
takes outside air and brings it in and
 
00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
refreshes it with the indoor air uh so
 
00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
there is no down side to having a home
 
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
too tight other that than the need to
 
00:42:33.349 --> 00:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
refresh the Aira using a energy recovery
 
00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
ventilator now um those are very
 
00:42:38.829 --> 00:42:38.839 align:start position:0%
efficient as well but yes that's how you
 
00:42:38.839 --> 00:42:39.510 align:start position:0%
efficient as well but yes that's how you
do

00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:43.829 align:start position:0%
do
it

00:42:43.829 --> 00:42:43.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:48.589 --> 00:42:48.599 align:start position:0%
followup does the exchange rate also
 
00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
change is there how many how often is
 
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
the 2021 code going up requiring an air
 
00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:56.200 align:start position:0%
exchange rate in SE building it's going
 
00:42:58.870 --> 00:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
to three so it's going up to at 50
 
00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:01.960 align:start position:0%
pascals of pressure uh it's a leakage of
 
00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
three air changes per hour at 50
 
00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
pascals little bit higher than than was
 
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
there in the 2018
 
00:43:12.349 --> 00:43:12.359 align:start position:0%
code so a tighter house but fewer
 
00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
exchanges tighter house don't confuse
 
00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:17.240 align:start position:0%
them the air there's two two components
 
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
here it's important to understand the
 
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
difference the way we test a home is we
 
00:43:24.069 --> 00:43:24.079 align:start position:0%
seal it put a blow door on it pressurize
 
00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
it to 50 pascals and measure the amount
 
00:43:27.829 --> 00:43:27.839 align:start position:0%
of air leaking out of it that's the
 
00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:31.000 align:start position:0%
first one the second one is ventilation
 
00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
how much air are you refreshing in the
 
00:43:35.829 --> 00:43:35.839 align:start position:0%
building in order to improve the oxygen
 
00:43:37.870 --> 00:43:37.880 align:start position:0%
content and reduce carbon dioxide and
 
00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
improve the health of the occupants they
 
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
are different for air exchange rate you
 
00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
want 3 to five that's generally what
 
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
you're looking for in terms of exchange
 
00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:51.640 align:start position:0%
rate for pressure testing you want three
 
00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:55.079 align:start position:0%
or less uh you want it to be low uh
 
00:43:57.549 --> 00:43:57.559 align:start position:0%
passive house for example plus 6 so
 
00:44:00.069 --> 00:44:00.079 align:start position:0%
those buildings are extremely tight the
 
00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
2021 code isn't that tight it's uh
 
00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:06.640 align:start position:0%
actually three under 50 pascals of
 
00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
pressure so it's tighter than the 2018
 
00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
code but
 
00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:18.920 align:start position:0%
bit thank you very much for your input I
 
00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate your attending thank you for
 
00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:24.990 align:start position:0%
appreciate your attending thank you for
your

00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.109 align:start position:0%

00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee okay seeing no motion to
 
00:44:48.349 --> 00:44:48.359 align:start position:0%
adopt U the energy
 
00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment um I will entertain a motion
 
00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:55.240 align:start position:0%
to uh pass the bill with the amendment
 
00:44:56.589 --> 00:44:56.599 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
00:44:56.599 --> 00:44:58.349 align:start position:0%
that we have
adopted

00:44:58.349 --> 00:44:58.359 align:start position:0%
adopted
 
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
move and do I have a
 
00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:10.990 align:start position:0%
move and do I have a
second

00:45:10.990 --> 00:45:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
discussion all those in favor
 
00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:22.280 align:start position:0%
I okay I declare the subcommittee
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
meeting closed
 
00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:27.880 align:start position:0%
meeting closed
sorry
