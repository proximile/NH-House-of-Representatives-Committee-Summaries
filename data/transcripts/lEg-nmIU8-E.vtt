00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 align:start position:0%
okay the uh minutes of our previous
 
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 align:start position:0%
meeting were distributed and they're
 
00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 align:start position:0%
posted on the website are there any
 
00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 align:start position:0%

representative Packard any
 
00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 align:start position:0%
discussion those in
 
00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.550 align:start position:0%
discussion those in
favor

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 align:start position:0%
favor
 
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 align:start position:0%
opposed all right thank
 
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 align:start position:0%
you that's fine you you were not here so
 
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
that make
 
00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 align:start position:0%
sense all right so we had got some some
 
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 align:start position:0%
suggestions from a number
 
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
of um members in and the first one is
 
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 align:start position:0%
multiplier changes we got sen Senator
 
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 align:start position:0%
gray had one proposed and it has been
 
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
costed Mr real presented some other
 
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
other changes that we can consider as
 
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 align:start position:0%
well um but first
 
00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:52.879 align:start position:0%
Senator uh certainly I would like to
 
00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 align:start position:0%
speak to the rationale behind what I
 
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 align:start position:0%
propose um when various members
 
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 align:start position:0%
uh that were in favor of the house bill
 
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 align:start position:0%
uh that came over in
 
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 align:start position:0%
hb2 um they said that retention was a
 
00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 align:start position:0%
big issue and that doing house build to
 
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
was going to uh solve or help to solve
 
00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
the retention issue uh when I looked at
 
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 align:start position:0%
that I said
 
00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:25.159 align:start position:0%
well uh it doesn't do anything for
 
00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 align:start position:0%
anyone except for those people in that
 
00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 align:start position:0%
uh that space uh that
 
00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
were uh
 
00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 align:start position:0%
members or or employed by the state but
 
00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 align:start position:0%
not vested at the time the legislation
 
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 align:start position:0%
was changed
 
00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:44.439 align:start position:0%
previously so looking at that and
 
00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 align:start position:0%
looking at the cost estimat that I got I
 
00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 align:start position:0%
says well if it's a retention issue then
 
00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 align:start position:0%
I need to affect all the members in
 
00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:53.429 align:start position:0%
I need to affect all the members in
group

00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:53.439 align:start position:0%
group
 
00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
two not just the at that time uh
 
00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 align:start position:0%
1,824 people
 
00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
and so if you look at the revised update
 
00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 align:start position:0%
that you guys got at the top of page two
 
00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
is what I asked the retirement system to
 
00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 align:start position:0%
cost out for
 
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
me and that was a plan that for all of
 
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.949 align:start position:0%
me and that was a plan that for all of
group

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 align:start position:0%
group
 
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 align:start position:0%
two both the people who were and were
 
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 align:start position:0%
not hired at the time we did the last
 
00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199 align:start position:0%
change to increase by
 
00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:32.950 align:start position:0%
change to increase by
uh

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 align:start position:0%
0.25% uh their retirement up to uh a
 
00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 align:start position:0%
total of
 
00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 align:start position:0%
2.5 and then at 30 years that would have
 
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
happened at 20 years and then at 30
 
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 align:start position:0%
years it would go up another
 
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
0.25% so bringing those people up to a
 
00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
2.5 again looking at trying to do
 
00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 align:start position:0%
something for retention not only for the
 
00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
employees in that Gap but for the
 
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 align:start position:0%
employees that were uh affected or or
 
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
hired after that uh because truly if
 
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
it's a retention issue uh my problem
 
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
with retention isn't going to go away
 
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
with the people in that Gap it's going
 
00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:21.319 align:start position:0%
to continue on
 
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 align:start position:0%
further and so to do something for them
 
00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
um again the years that this multiplier
 
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.110 align:start position:0%
um again the years that this multiplier
changes

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 align:start position:0%
uh could be adjusted it could be that
 
00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 align:start position:0%
you bring it to 2.5 at 20 years it could
 
00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:38.319 align:start position:0%
be that you bring it to
 
00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 align:start position:0%
2.25 at 20 and then go to 2.5 at 25
 
00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
years there was a wide range but each
 
00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 align:start position:0%
one of those uh would have a various
 
00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:53.199 align:start position:0%
varying cost but that proposal doesn't
 
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
do anything for the cola which is the
 
00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 align:start position:0%
other issue that was brought before me
 
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 align:start position:0%
all right and that that is for the cola
 
00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:03.639 align:start position:0%
EXC me Senator we're talking about Cola
 
00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
separately if that's well you say this
 
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
this proposal doesn't affect colas it it
 
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
it relates to the plan uh Madam chair
 
00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
and if I might have a a little bit and
 
00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 align:start position:0%
the reason why you know
 
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
that the two of them together is an
 
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
expense and so to try to get to that
 
00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:24.919 align:start position:0%
total expense I kind of need to speak to
 
00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
both at the same
 
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
time and
 
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.749 align:start position:0%
time and
so

00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:30.759 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
in the system that we have right now
 
00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:36.599 align:start position:0%
there is no match you can make voluntary
 
00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:39.800 align:start position:0%
contributions okay I certainly did that
 
00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:41.560 align:start position:0%
when I was working for the federal
 
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
government and you know I have enough
 
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
money in there that uh it certainly is
 
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
worthwhile and so by having that account
 
00:06:56.589 --> 00:06:56.599 align:start position:0%
and having a match up to say a 5% and
 
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
taking and funding that out of
 
00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:04.520 align:start position:0%
salary because it would be funded as a
 
00:07:06.869 --> 00:07:06.879 align:start position:0%
uh benefit so it would come out the same
 
00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
way you would negotiate a salary and
 
00:07:12.189 --> 00:07:12.199 align:start position:0%
have the groups being able to say well I
 
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
want a 4% raise I'll take one in match
 
00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:17.560 align:start position:0%
I'll take three in salary or whatever
 
00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
you negotiate and so the two of those
 
00:07:22.749 --> 00:07:22.759 align:start position:0%
together and if you look at the cost
 
00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:25.639 align:start position:0%
estimate on the top of your sheet that
 
00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:27.160 align:start position:0%
was about 15
 
00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:31.919 align:start position:0%
million and if I look at at the estimate
 
00:07:34.029 --> 00:07:34.039 align:start position:0%
and again it was not a hard and fast
 
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
number because uh that I got from the
 
00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:39.039 align:start position:0%
administrative Services people they said
 
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
it was around 13 to5 million that if
 
00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
everyone that was a state employee took
 
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
the match and we matched it it would be
 
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:49.360 align:start position:0%
about that
 
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
same okay so the two of them
 
00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:56.560 align:start position:0%
together would be around $30
 
00:07:59.710 --> 00:07:59.720 align:start position:0%
million 15 it would be in in the first
 
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
year because that that uh the one for
 
00:08:05.629 --> 00:08:05.639 align:start position:0%
the match would continue on past then
 
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
but again it would happen the same way
 
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
the salaries would so those two together
 
00:08:14.189 --> 00:08:14.199 align:start position:0%
um to me was a significant change and
 
00:08:16.189 --> 00:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
would help retention and would do a lot
 
00:08:20.149 --> 00:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
of the things that people asked me to do
 
00:08:22.749 --> 00:08:22.759 align:start position:0%
when looking at house bille to thank you
 
00:08:25.749 --> 00:08:25.759 align:start position:0%
m CH
 
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:32.070 align:start position:0%
okay thank
you

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any comments or
 
00:08:37.389 --> 00:08:37.399 align:start position:0%
questions on this this plan Mr
 
00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:39.560 align:start position:0%
real thank you madam chair I would have
 
00:08:41.149 --> 00:08:41.159 align:start position:0%
a a question for Senator gray if he'd be
 
00:08:43.949 --> 00:08:43.959 align:start position:0%
willing to take it absolutely um so
 
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
Senator gray in your first proposal um
 
00:08:47.829 --> 00:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
you mentioned wanting to do this because
 
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:49.640 align:start position:0%
we wanted to impact change for all
 
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
members of the system which I can uh
 
00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
fully appreciate and I think that uh
 
00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
everyone in this room can do that um but
 
00:08:59.590 --> 00:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
your second proposal would only only
 
00:09:01.069 --> 00:09:01.079 align:start position:0%
impact state
 
00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
employees and um I'm not sure that we
 
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
would want to have uh at least from from
 
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
the firefighters perspective uh further
 
00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:13.640 align:start position:0%
discussion on a a program that would
 
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
only affect a a certain number of people
 
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
even within that um either slotting
 
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:22.360 align:start position:0%
scale or the full system when we talk
 
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
about uh employee matches that exist now
 
00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:26.600 align:start position:0%
at the local level and we can do that
 
00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
now in fact it's being done uh in the
 
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
city of over currently and it has been
 
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
done for uh over 20 years I believe um
 
00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:38.959 align:start position:0%
so that exists now um so I'm not sure if
 
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
your proposal if I'm misunderstanding it
 
00:09:44.829 --> 00:09:44.839 align:start position:0%
or if it would just only impact state
 
00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:49.160 align:start position:0%
employees uh thank you um when I was
 
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
researching this um I was not told I was
 
00:09:55.389 --> 00:09:55.399 align:start position:0%
told that there would need to be
 
00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:57.640 align:start position:0%
statutory authority to be able to do the
 
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
match okay uh again because it wasn't
 
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:04.600 align:start position:0%
didn't come out as a formal proposal uh
 
00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
but the state employees are the only
 
00:10:09.069 --> 00:10:09.079 align:start position:0%
ones that I can do negotiate benefits
 
00:10:12.389 --> 00:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
with or you know have them uh the cities
 
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:14.680 align:start position:0%
and towns would be free to do whatever
 
00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:20.240 align:start position:0%
they choose to do um again it separates
 
00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:23.320 align:start position:0%
it from the retirement system so yeah if
 
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:26.200 align:start position:0%
the local governments wanted to do it
 
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
and again your local firefighters if
 
00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:33.560 align:start position:0%
they came in and said okay we want a 6%
 
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
raise but we're willing to take 2% in
 
00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:40.120 align:start position:0%
match and whatever and hopefully your
 
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
your Dober firefighters have already you
 
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
know gotten to there so maybe you know
 
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
they're ahead of the game but um that is
 
00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:51.160 align:start position:0%
not the case as far as I was told in any
 
00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:53.560 align:start position:0%
other community uh because I wasn't even
 
00:10:58.269 --> 00:10:58.279 align:start position:0%
told about Dober so um again I you know
 
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to make make sure that that
 
00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
I'm offering things to to various people
 
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
okay the first proposal on the adding
 
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
the percentage would affect all group
 
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:14.680 align:start position:0%
two this proposal here on um the match
 
00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
would affect every state employee
 
00:11:21.949 --> 00:11:21.959 align:start position:0%
everyone okay I can't talk to the local
 
00:11:24.629 --> 00:11:24.639 align:start position:0%
ones because I don't have any control
 
00:11:27.949 --> 00:11:27.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:27.959 --> 00:11:32.710 align:start position:0%
 
benefits

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions
 
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
comments okay Mr real would you like to
 
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
present the other multiplier changes you
 
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
suggested thank you madam chair I will
 
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
try and be brief here there's there's
 
00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:52.600 align:start position:0%
two multiplier changes here uh they are
 
00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
very similar to one another uh it builds
 
00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
off of uh some Concepts that were
 
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
discussed at the last meeting regarding
 
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
um some sort of incentive for
 
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
retention and uh it also is a is a bit
 
00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:13.240 align:start position:0%
of a spin-off from Senator Bradley's
 
00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:16.120 align:start position:0%
amendments that he presented essentially
 
00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:19.279 align:start position:0%
the the change here would be um to
 
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley's amendment that a
 
00:12:24.629 --> 00:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
member would only receive the uh two and
 
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
a half%
 
00:12:29.069 --> 00:12:29.079 align:start position:0%
multiplier uh for every year of service
 
00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:32.120 align:start position:0%
should they reach their required age and
 
00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:34.040 align:start position:0%
years of service as it is under current
 
00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
law uh if I'm not mistaken the current
 
00:12:41.189 --> 00:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment uh was to include the
 
00:12:41.199 --> 00:12:42.710 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment uh was to include the
2.5%

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
2.5%
 
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
multiplier uh for everyone in that
 
00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
sliding scale regardless of when they
 
00:12:50.189 --> 00:12:50.199 align:start position:0%
left the system um but I think it has
 
00:12:53.269 --> 00:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
the potential to decrease the cost uh
 
00:12:53.279 --> 00:12:54.150 align:start position:0%
the potential to decrease the cost uh
some

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:54.160 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:56.920 align:start position:0%
amount uh if we take into consideration
 
00:12:59.150 --> 00:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
those that potentially leave before
 
00:13:02.509 --> 00:13:02.519 align:start position:0%
their required time and age um for
 
00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:04.360 align:start position:0%
whatever the reason may be either on
 
00:13:07.189 --> 00:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
vested deferred retirement uh disability
 
00:13:09.269 --> 00:13:09.279 align:start position:0%
or removing their money from the system
 
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
alog together so um I would propose that
 
00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:14.440 align:start position:0%
we look at the costs uh of doing this to
 
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
see if there's a decrease to the $92
 
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:20.720 align:start position:0%
million uh price tag on the original
 
00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:27.629 --> 00:13:27.639 align:start position:0%
Amendment and number two well sorry I'd
 
00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
like to see if there any discussion on
 
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
that that sounds very very sensible to
 
00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
me because
 
00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
we're um it will obviously save money
 
00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.470 align:start position:0%
we're um it will obviously save money
for

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
those those people who leave early would
 
00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:45.720 align:start position:0%
not get the full full benefit of the
 
00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
change any other comments
 
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
comment I think anything that makes it
 
00:13:59.829 --> 00:13:59.839 align:start position:0%
more cost effective
 
00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:03.560 align:start position:0%
would be a good thing so um I think if
 
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to look at it
 
00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:11.720 align:start position:0%
i' want to ask Mr Carlin
 
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
whether this
 
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
proposal um can be looked at by GRS
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
without having to do a entire new
 
00:14:20.399 --> 00:14:27.670 align:start position:0%
without having to do a entire new
Actuarial

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:34.590 align:start position:0%
 
analysis

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:34.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator Bradley for the record
 
00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
Marty Carlin from
 
00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:41.560 align:start position:0%
nhrs uh an answer to your question uh we
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
I can I we can pose that question to GRS
 
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh for an impression on an order of
 
00:14:51.189 --> 00:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
magnitude on what this may affect the
 
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
cost they wouldn't give us a number or
 
00:14:56.389 --> 00:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
percentage without a full Val but uh we
 
00:14:59.230 --> 00:14:59.240 align:start position:0%
can brooch the question so um
 
00:15:02.509 --> 00:15:02.519 align:start position:0%
um commissioner will if if um or the
 
00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:04.120 align:start position:0%
chair somebody can send us the exact
 
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
wording of The Proposal we can I
 
00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:08.600 align:start position:0%
approach that the GRS and since it's not
 
00:15:10.509 --> 00:15:10.519 align:start position:0%
a full
 
00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
analysis possibly could get you the
 
00:15:14.389 --> 00:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
answer for next week if not you know
 
00:15:16.829 --> 00:15:16.839 align:start position:0%
then not long after that because it
 
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
would would have to be a cost decrease
 
00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:23.320 align:start position:0%
even if only one person retired without
 
00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
reaching the age of um yeah or
 
00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
whatever so
 
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
yes mi Mr R and I will work out what the
 
00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:34.240 align:start position:0%
specific language should that you should
 
00:15:37.749 --> 00:15:37.759 align:start position:0%
talk to GRS about after this meeting
 
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
yeah so if I can just ask
 
00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:45.160 align:start position:0%
that um I think Mr R when you talked
 
00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
about it you talked about the amendment
 
00:15:50.829 --> 00:15:50.839 align:start position:0%
of 2.55% for everybody I think it should
 
00:15:54.749 --> 00:15:54.759 align:start position:0%
be analyzed on the 2.5 as well as the
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
split 2.25 and
 
00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.509 align:start position:0%
split 2.25 and
2.5

00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
2.5
 
00:15:59.519 --> 00:16:03.309 align:start position:0%
2.5
okay

00:16:03.309 --> 00:16:03.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:07.309 --> 00:16:07.319 align:start position:0%
thanks okay so anyone
 
00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:11.560 align:start position:0%
else any your next next comments um the
 
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
next multiplier uh recommendation is
 
00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
very similar to the first uh the only
 
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:21.240 align:start position:0%
change here is that uh it would impact
 
00:16:23.069 --> 00:16:23.079 align:start position:0%
to Senator Gray's Point everyone in the
 
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
system obviously the cost would be uh
 
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
significantly higher uh but the formula
 
00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
would be the same um in that the uh
 
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
members hired after July 1 2011 would
 
00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.430 align:start position:0%
members hired after July 1 2011 would
receive

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
receive
 
00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
2.25% for all years of service but again
 
00:16:44.189 --> 00:16:44.199 align:start position:0%
only if they reach their required age
 
00:16:47.069 --> 00:16:47.079 align:start position:0%
and years of service which as we all
 
00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:50.920 align:start position:0%
know uh for that group is 25 years uh
 
00:16:54.509 --> 00:16:54.519 align:start position:0%
and age 52 and a half uh in order to
 
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
collect so it essentially be the same
 
00:16:59.829 --> 00:16:59.839 align:start position:0%
calculation um and the reason I thought
 
00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
that these might work uh and then and
 
00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
then full disclosure that might be part
 
00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:07.720 align:start position:0%
of a a longer term discussion and that's
 
00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
fair um when we look at the cost of that
 
00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:14.120 align:start position:0%
but the reason these came up is uh the
 
00:17:16.949 --> 00:17:16.959 align:start position:0%
numbers as we're looking at them now and
 
00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:19.400 align:start position:0%
Mr Carlin can correct me if I'm mistaken
 
00:17:22.429 --> 00:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
but we're somewhere around 1730 members
 
00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
in that sliding scale uh and when we
 
00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:27.160 align:start position:0%
were having these discussions last year
 
00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:30.320 align:start position:0%
um it was 100 m numbers more than that
 
00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:31.350 align:start position:0%
um it was 100 m numbers more than that
um

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:34.600 align:start position:0%
so uh you know when we look at those
 
00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:36.440 align:start position:0%
that are currently retirement eligible
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
in that sliding scale um by my simple
 
00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:42.520 align:start position:0%
firefighter math uh somewhere around
 
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
1,500 or so uh we estimate have not
 
00:17:47.669 --> 00:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
actually reached reached their required
 
00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:51.160 align:start position:0%
age uh eligibility and time in service
 
00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
so we think this could potentially work
 
00:17:54.909 --> 00:17:54.919 align:start position:0%
uh when we look at the people that are
 
00:17:54.919 --> 00:17:57.390 align:start position:0%
uh when we look at the people that are
leaving

00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:01.110 align:start position:0%
 
early

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:06.669 --> 00:18:06.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:16.029 --> 00:18:16.039 align:start position:0%
right so this has two differences if I
 
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
understand correctly the first is that
 
00:18:23.149 --> 00:18:23.159 align:start position:0%
it's based on the um two and a quarter
 
00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
percent for one group in the Gap and the
 
00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
other is it extends to all current hires
 
00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:33.640 align:start position:0%
at the two and a half 2 and a qu% level
 
00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
correct correct essentially um if you
 
00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
were in that sliding scale uh then this
 
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
proposal would be the same as the first
 
00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:46.360 align:start position:0%
and anyone hired uh that was not a part
 
00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
of that sliding scale um would go to a
 
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
two and a quarter
 
00:18:55.789 --> 00:18:55.799 align:start position:0%
perc they're currently at uh 2% okay
 
00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions or
 
00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:01.029 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions or
concerns

00:19:01.029 --> 00:19:01.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:01.039 --> 00:19:05.590 align:start position:0%
 
terms

00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:08.549 --> 00:19:08.559 align:start position:0%
um anything
 
00:19:12.909 --> 00:19:12.919 align:start position:0%
else does anyone else have a proposal or
 
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
a comment we should discuss on the
 
00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:17.990 align:start position:0%
a comment we should discuss on the
multiplier

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
multiplier
 
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
issue Senator Susi no okay all right so
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
we will work on the specifics of this
 
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
proposal for GRS so that it can be at
 
00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:33.480 align:start position:0%
least costed
 
00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:36.630 align:start position:0%
least costed
roughly

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
and Mr Fuller has presented a
 
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
number of other
 
00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:50.710 align:start position:0%
number of other
changes

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to not do number one the
 
00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
cola account until we get to cola's so
 
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
so that's fine fine number two yes with
 
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
uh number two and thank you madam chair
 
00:20:07.549 --> 00:20:07.559 align:start position:0%
um and these with these proposals here I
 
00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
mean some of them are going to be you
 
00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:11.080 align:start position:0%
know just group one or you know both
 
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
groups and I also acknowledge too that
 
00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:14.200 align:start position:0%
some of these are more of the short-term
 
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
versus long-term variety so there's
 
00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
definitely quite a mix in here so I
 
00:20:18.909 --> 00:20:18.919 align:start position:0%
wanted to acknowledge that in terms of
 
00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:20.120 align:start position:0%
things we could potentially do in the
 
00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
short term versus potentially things for
 
00:20:24.789 --> 00:20:24.799 align:start position:0%
the long term for this one right here
 
00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
with uh actually with with with making
 
00:20:28.669 --> 00:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
this change
 
00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
um one big benefit I see in this is that
 
00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:35.320 align:start position:0%
it would
 
00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:38.200 align:start position:0%
allow more people in the group and I
 
00:20:39.789 --> 00:20:39.799 align:start position:0%
think if more people are in the group I
 
00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
think that would definitely be a benefit
 
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:43.919 align:start position:0%
yes there' be more more people down the
 
00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
road that would also be eligible for
 
00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:46.799 align:start position:0%
benefits but if more people are actually
 
00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
paying into the group I think that's a
 
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
good thing because I know one thing that
 
00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
we've talked about here is you know
 
00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
money and funding and you know things
 
00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
cost money so I think if more people are
 
00:20:57.870 --> 00:20:57.880 align:start position:0%
paying into the system by making that so
 
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
that now you know so right now it's it's
 
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
30 hours to be in there if you lower it
 
00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
down to 20 and just kind of knowing too
 
00:21:07.549 --> 00:21:07.559 align:start position:0%
that our the picture of how people that
 
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
are working within the the system is
 
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
changing you know and there are more
 
00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
people that are kind of doing it later
 
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
on maybe they do a career they kind of
 
00:21:15.669 --> 00:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
come into it later on the life and this
 
00:21:18.269 --> 00:21:18.279 align:start position:0%
kind of knowing too they would be able
 
00:21:20.269 --> 00:21:20.279 align:start position:0%
to potentially get a benefit I think it
 
00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:22.120 align:start position:0%
works on both ends and it also would
 
00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
bring more people in and I think it it
 
00:21:26.029 --> 00:21:26.039 align:start position:0%
works on both the attraction and the
 
00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
retention angle end so that would be um
 
00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:33.080 align:start position:0%
I think some of the benefits there um I
 
00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
don't if you I can stop there or keep on
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
going or I believe there might be some
 
00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
comment you heard me earlier um I think
 
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
one of the the oh uh thank you um one of
 
00:21:50.909 --> 00:21:50.919 align:start position:0%
the things that I would submit on the 20
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
hours a week and and we looked at that
 
00:21:55.269 --> 00:21:55.279 align:start position:0%
when we first got this in in BO we run
 
00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:57.320 align:start position:0%
our own buses for example our own
 
00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:58.789 align:start position:0%
our own buses for example our own
transportation

00:21:58.789 --> 00:21:58.799 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:00.440 align:start position:0%
um which a lot of districts don't a lot
 
00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
of the drivers that I have are already
 
00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
retired maybe collecting a pension
 
00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
lowering the threshold to 20 hours would
 
00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
make all or at least most of my drivers
 
00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:14.440 align:start position:0%
eligible for retirement and would kind
 
00:22:16.909 --> 00:22:16.919 align:start position:0%
of impact um where I'm already looking
 
00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:19.960 align:start position:0%
for for drivers um the other you know
 
00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
impact for us is going to be in food
 
00:22:23.549 --> 00:22:23.559 align:start position:0%
service we have a number of employees
 
00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
who will come in do a little bit of prep
 
00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
serve and a little bit of cleaning four
 
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
hours a day four and a half hours a day
 
00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:34.840 align:start position:0%
all of those employees in Food Service
 
00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
would be also eligible under this
 
00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
proposal to be in the retirement system
 
00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:42.200 align:start position:0%
that's a self-funded program um we're in
 
00:22:44.269 --> 00:22:44.279 align:start position:0%
a lot of districts uh those programs
 
00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:46.520 align:start position:0%
don't make money and are offset by
 
00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:49.919 align:start position:0%
transfers from the general fund um so
 
00:22:51.549 --> 00:22:51.559 align:start position:0%
those two things would be a little
 
00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
hesitation I think from my perspective
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.350 align:start position:0%
 
districts

00:22:59.350 --> 00:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:23:02.669 --> 00:23:02.679 align:start position:0%
Senator Greg uh are those employees that
 
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
we're talking about currently covered
 
00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:06.520 align:start position:0%
under Social Security and not the
 
00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:07.710 align:start position:0%
under Social Security and not the
retirement

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:07.720 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:10.799 align:start position:0%
system so all of our employees in the
 
00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
school district we pay social security
 
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
on is that your question yeah so I don't
 
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
I don't have uh any uh you know group
 
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
two members who like a lot of police and
 
00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:22.760 align:start position:0%
fire my understanding is don't employers
 
00:23:25.029 --> 00:23:25.039 align:start position:0%
don't pay social security on that every
 
00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
single employee that I have currently in
 
00:23:29.669 --> 00:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
both districts that I work for we play
 
00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:31.240 align:start position:0%
employer Social
 
00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:36.200 align:start position:0%
Security Senator BR uh so if we're
 
00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
looking at a match to being able to to
 
00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
do contributions uh that would also
 
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:45.240 align:start position:0%
augment their retirement system uh or
 
00:23:49.909 --> 00:23:49.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:53.029 --> 00:23:53.039 align:start position:0%
retirement yeah and I have a concern
 
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
about that
 
00:23:58.950 --> 00:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
20 hour a week limit because because if
 
00:24:03.269 --> 00:24:03.279 align:start position:0%
I remember correctly that was imposed by
 
00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
the federal government as a requirement
 
00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
for health insurance and other benefits
 
00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
so if you've got people that you are
 
00:24:15.029 --> 00:24:15.039 align:start position:0%
choosing to to keep part-time so they
 
00:24:18.029 --> 00:24:18.039 align:start position:0%
don't get benefits adding this benefit
 
00:24:21.029 --> 00:24:21.039 align:start position:0%
does not make sense to me it would make
 
00:24:23.549 --> 00:24:23.559 align:start position:0%
more sense if you were to make a
 
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
contribution to a defined benefit
 
00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
Retirement System
 
00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
separately from their
 
00:24:36.669 --> 00:24:36.679 align:start position:0%
pay Mr martines thank you um I'd like to
 
00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
um to state that I agree with that
 
00:24:40.909 --> 00:24:40.919 align:start position:0%
proposal number two I think it's very
 
00:24:43.909 --> 00:24:43.919 align:start position:0%
important we you know the way things are
 
00:24:45.389 --> 00:24:45.399 align:start position:0%
you could end up with everybody
 
00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
part-time no benefit no insurance nobody
 
00:24:49.389 --> 00:24:49.399 align:start position:0%
staying on the job impossible to hire
 
00:24:51.789 --> 00:24:51.799 align:start position:0%
teachers that's what's happening with
 
00:24:54.149 --> 00:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
other positions in the state in fact I
 
00:24:57.870 --> 00:24:57.880 align:start position:0%
would like to apply this and if if he
 
00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
agrees to to every employee of a New
 
00:25:04.549 --> 00:25:04.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system participant
 
00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:07.640 align:start position:0%
employer we do have a lot of workers
 
00:25:10.389 --> 00:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
that work in toe booths liquor store
 
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
they do part-time jobs we have disp
 
00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
positions there are 40 hours and we cut
 
00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
that in 220s with no benefits it becomes
 
00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:20.799 align:start position:0%
impossible to train retain knowledge and
 
00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:24.440 align:start position:0%
keep anybody in fact our unfilled
 
00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
positions are at alltime higher higher
 
00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
than ever
 
00:25:29.909 --> 00:25:29.919 align:start position:0%
so I think this is very important I
 
00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:31.480 align:start position:0%
think it can be done I think we should
 
00:25:33.389 --> 00:25:33.399 align:start position:0%
look at it and I think we should try to
 
00:25:36.389 --> 00:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
uh to make this happen thank you madam
 
00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:37.640 align:start position:0%
chair and I
 
00:25:39.789 --> 00:25:39.799 align:start position:0%
will anyone
 
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
else Mr fer yes if I if I could just
 
00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:45.240 align:start position:0%
comment on your um I could be mistaken
 
00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
here but in ter I I understand your
 
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
concerned about the um added benefits
 
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
but my understanding is that just
 
00:25:53.389 --> 00:25:53.399 align:start position:0%
because they would be entitled to
 
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
retirement benefits I mean the threshold
 
00:25:57.669 --> 00:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
would stay the same in terms of being
 
00:25:59.110 --> 00:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
titled to other benefits I mean just
 
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
because they could do retirement
 
00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
benefits doesn't mean that all of a
 
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
sudden they would be eligible for health
 
00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
insurance but I I could be mistaken but
 
00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:08.440 align:start position:0%
that's just my understanding of health
 
00:26:09.789 --> 00:26:09.799 align:start position:0%
benefits anything else just wanted to
 
00:26:13.149 --> 00:26:13.159 align:start position:0%
make that one big comment and to uh
 
00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
refer to what you were saying I I would
 
00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:17.000 align:start position:0%
not be opposed of um naturally I'm
 
00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:18.760 align:start position:0%
coming from a teacher perspective but at
 
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
the same time um I know I'm like you I'm
 
00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
open to things that could benefit all of
 
00:26:26.789 --> 00:26:26.799 align:start position:0%
us so um and whether it benefits a
 
00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
certain group I mean that's fine too but
 
00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
if we can look at things that could
 
00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:33.240 align:start position:0%
benefit um you know multiple different
 
00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
groups of employees I would not be
 
00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
opposed to that at all mam chair if I
 
00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:39.320 align:start position:0%
could just yes quick one continue thank
 
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
you uh this is also very important for
 
00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of folks that have
 
00:26:47.549 --> 00:26:47.559 align:start position:0%
deferred benefits in there and they are
 
00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:49.919 align:start position:0%
no longer working a full-time job and
 
00:26:51.789 --> 00:26:51.799 align:start position:0%
this would be a way that they would go
 
00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
back to contributing to the retirement
 
00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
system and it will be a win-win for
 
00:26:59.669 --> 00:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
everybody be win for employers employees
 
00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
you know and the community I'll say this
 
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
would only grow the pension in a
 
00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
positive way so I think this is a move
 
00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:14.360 align:start position:0%
you anyone else have a
 
00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:18.200 align:start position:0%
comment Senator so I think the threshold
 
00:27:19.149 --> 00:27:19.159 align:start position:0%
that was
 
00:27:21.549 --> 00:27:21.559 align:start position:0%
adopted um for the higher number of
 
00:27:25.909 --> 00:27:25.919 align:start position:0%
hours was there for a reason um I I I
 
00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
tend to think this is going to
 
00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
significantly drive up costs um for
 
00:27:35.149 --> 00:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers so I think we should
 
00:27:39.029 --> 00:27:39.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:43.880 align:start position:0%
it okay Senator Bray can we get the
 
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
retirement system to comment on that
 
00:27:48.909 --> 00:27:48.919 align:start position:0%
whether it would drive up costs or
 
00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:51.720 align:start position:0%
potentially drive up costs I guess from
 
00:27:54.669 --> 00:27:54.679 align:start position:0%
from looking at it to my perspective it
 
00:27:57.549 --> 00:27:57.559 align:start position:0%
it would be a benefit to the retirements
 
00:27:59.269 --> 00:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
system if these people never became
 
00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:01.480 align:start position:0%
vested because they would start to
 
00:28:04.549 --> 00:28:04.559 align:start position:0%
contribute but once they become vested
 
00:28:06.909 --> 00:28:06.919 align:start position:0%
it should be a break even for the
 
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
retirement system and I would like to
 
00:28:18.269 --> 00:28:18.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:20.440 align:start position:0%
that thanks thanks for the question
 
00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:24.200 align:start position:0%
Senator gray um well you know right now
 
00:28:26.909 --> 00:28:26.919 align:start position:0%
um membership is for full-time permanent
 
00:28:26.919 --> 00:28:27.990 align:start position:0%
um membership is for full-time permanent
employees

00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
as the way the statute defines uh
 
00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:33.480 align:start position:0%
eligible membership um we have
 
00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
administrative rules that Define minimum
 
00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:37.640 align:start position:0%
participation standards for the
 
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
different groups uh for employees it's
 
00:28:43.549 --> 00:28:43.559 align:start position:0%
either 35 or 37 and a half hours a week
 
00:28:46.029 --> 00:28:46.039 align:start position:0%
uh for teachers it's 30 um
 
00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:49.240 align:start position:0%
paraprofessionals fall under 35 hours a
 
00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:52.360 align:start position:0%
week unless the district opts to um
 
00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:54.440 align:start position:0%
petition to add them at 30 as
 
00:28:56.789 --> 00:28:56.799 align:start position:0%
contributing members uh group two it's
 
00:28:59.630 --> 00:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
full-time as defined by the employer uh
 
00:29:00.909 --> 00:29:00.919 align:start position:0%
because of the nature of the shifts with
 
00:29:02.509 --> 00:29:02.519 align:start position:0%
the group two so there's there's
 
00:29:04.029 --> 00:29:04.039 align:start position:0%
different minimum participation
 
00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:08.120 align:start position:0%
standards right now um our contribution
 
00:29:10.029 --> 00:29:10.039 align:start position:0%
rates are assessed as a percentage of
 
00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:12.440 align:start position:0%
covered payroll so there's the cost to
 
00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
pre fund the benefit the the unfunded
 
00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:17.480 align:start position:0%
piece and then the medical subsidy piece
 
00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
and our payrolls is about $3 billion um
 
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
for active contributing members right
 
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
now Statewide uh if you were adding
 
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
payroll of part- timr to that um you
 
00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:32.240 align:start position:0%
know initially you know they'd be paying
 
00:29:33.549 --> 00:29:33.559 align:start position:0%
the rates that were previously
 
00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:35.080 align:start position:0%
calculated and that would be more money
 
00:29:38.669 --> 00:29:38.679 align:start position:0%
coming in as we go through two-year rate
 
00:29:43.389 --> 00:29:43.399 align:start position:0%
Cycles the um uh you know as there's
 
00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:45.640 align:start position:0%
more money coming in it may impact the
 
00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:47.960 align:start position:0%
total percentage of the rates for the
 
00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:50.120 align:start position:0%
different groups but you know you you're
 
00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
bringing more people in so so the
 
00:29:53.509 --> 00:29:53.519 align:start position:0%
employees would be paying more because
 
00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
they have more payroll as part of the um
 
00:29:59.789 --> 00:29:59.799 align:start position:0%
part of the retirement system so um you
 
00:30:02.509 --> 00:30:02.519 align:start position:0%
know that that's you know how how that
 
00:30:05.389 --> 00:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
would impact the unfunded rate on a
 
00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:07.240 align:start position:0%
larger payroll portion or what the
 
00:30:09.389 --> 00:30:09.399 align:start position:0%
normal cost would be calculated for for
 
00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
a part-time because a couple other
 
00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
questions that come up with that is is a
 
00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:16.360 align:start position:0%
part-time recruting a full Year's worth
 
00:30:18.389 --> 00:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
of retirement service you know somebody
 
00:30:20.269 --> 00:30:20.279 align:start position:0%
could theoretically work 29 years as a
 
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
part-time one year as a full-time and
 
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
get a 30-year pension on their you know
 
00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
their average final salary or is it is
 
00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:29.960 align:start position:0%
there prata uh based on the hours work
 
00:30:31.509 --> 00:30:31.519 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of bookkeeping and
 
00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
accounting things that you know aren't
 
00:30:35.509 --> 00:30:35.519 align:start position:0%
insurmountable with that but that's a
 
00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:38.200 align:start position:0%
question uh question for our group two
 
00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner they know uh there are
 
00:30:41.549 --> 00:30:41.559 align:start position:0%
definitions and police standards of
 
00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:44.360 align:start position:0%
full-time and part-time certification so
 
00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
if you had a law enforcement that didn't
 
00:30:48.269 --> 00:30:48.279 align:start position:0%
beat this they have to be a certified
 
00:30:50.549 --> 00:30:50.559 align:start position:0%
law enforcement to be in group two how
 
00:30:52.909 --> 00:30:52.919 align:start position:0%
would sort of a special police who you
 
00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
know does crowd control at the school
 
00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:57.320 align:start position:0%
assembly be considered for membership
 
00:30:59.269 --> 00:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
ship there's a lot of nuts and bolts in
 
00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:01.240 align:start position:0%
there but the your larger question about
 
00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
costs is you'd be paying in on a larger
 
00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
percentage of payroll so you know
 
00:31:08.909 --> 00:31:08.919 align:start position:0%
there's more money coming in that way
 
00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:11.000 align:start position:0%
and how that's going to wash out you
 
00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
know over time you know whether the the
 
00:31:16.669 --> 00:31:16.679 align:start position:0%
ultimate um how much that is it would be
 
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
very hard to
 
00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:21.710 align:start position:0%
very hard to
project

00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
thank any other questions or comments on
 
00:31:26.159 --> 00:31:31.549 align:start position:0%
thank any other questions or comments on
this

00:31:31.549 --> 00:31:31.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:33.629 --> 00:31:33.639 align:start position:0%
okay all
 
00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
right your your number three is vesting
 
00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um so as far as um vesting
 
00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
so um The Proposal here would be to make
 
00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:45.080 align:start position:0%
this threshold of five years of of
 
00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
credible service so um and just I just
 
00:31:50.789 --> 00:31:50.799 align:start position:0%
noted here too that um you know with our
 
00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
close neighbors here that is their
 
00:31:55.269 --> 00:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
threshold is is five years so again um
 
00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
You' be again another way to um attract
 
00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:00.440 align:start position:0%
people and also not lose them to others
 
00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:02.240 align:start position:0%
so to be able to make that threshold a
 
00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
little bit lower so that when they're
 
00:32:06.269 --> 00:32:06.279 align:start position:0%
actually um vested in there because uh
 
00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:07.919 align:start position:0%
it would make New Hampshire a lot more
 
00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:11.000 align:start position:0%
attractive place to work um within the
 
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
the different groups and systems where
 
00:32:13.909 --> 00:32:13.919 align:start position:0%
it' be police fire teachers whatever
 
00:32:15.629 --> 00:32:15.639 align:start position:0%
else I mean just looking at lowering
 
00:32:16.909 --> 00:32:16.919 align:start position:0%
that would be I think definitely an
 
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
attraction and you know a fear of mine
 
00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
is that we're losing people to our to
 
00:32:23.909 --> 00:32:23.919 align:start position:0%
our neighbors and I think if that way it
 
00:32:25.909 --> 00:32:25.919 align:start position:0%
just makes it a much more makes uh
 
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
working in New Hampshire much more
 
00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
attractive lowering that threshold and
 
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
it's also matching it up where where
 
00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:32.120 align:start position:0%
others are at
 
00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
too thank you and does anyone have a
 
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
comment or question Mr camper um just as
 
00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
far as um you know I could see see how
 
00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:42.200 align:start position:0%
some people might read that as hey I'm
 
00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
gonna do five years and and get out of
 
00:32:46.509 --> 00:32:46.519 align:start position:0%
here I think that's actually um not
 
00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
going to be the case I think it would be
 
00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
a helpful retention tool because right
 
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
now people that are already here in the
 
00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
system um don't have a great sense of
 
00:32:57.029 --> 00:32:57.039 align:start position:0%
security with it do the changes that
 
00:32:59.549 --> 00:32:59.559 align:start position:0%
that were made about 10 years ago and um
 
00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:02.360 align:start position:0%
them knowing that you know I've got five
 
00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
years in the system I am now I guess
 
00:33:05.629 --> 00:33:05.639 align:start position:0%
considered vested I'm not sure that
 
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
there's even an actual definition of the
 
00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
term vesting um so you know if we could
 
00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:13.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps uh you know cify that and give
 
00:33:16.389 --> 00:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
them a greater sense of security that
 
00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
you know I can do five years for the
 
00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
state I don't need to worry about um you
 
00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:21.880 align:start position:0%
know potential changes I think that
 
00:33:24.789 --> 00:33:24.799 align:start position:0%
would be a good thing for uh for the
 
00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:26.120 align:start position:0%
retention problems that we seem to be
 
00:33:28.509 --> 00:33:28.519 align:start position:0%
having throughout this state
 
00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:32.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator gray um again I'd like
 
00:33:34.029 --> 00:33:34.039 align:start position:0%
to get the New Hampshire retirement
 
00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
system back up to the microphone uh the
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
effect of vesting if I leave before I am
 
00:33:42.789 --> 00:33:42.799 align:start position:0%
vested I believe I can take out the
 
00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
money that I've contributed but not any
 
00:33:48.629 --> 00:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
of the match uh if I leave afterward
 
00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
that uh there's some kind of and I'm not
 
00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
exactly sure why and that's one of the
 
00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
reasons I wanted to get you up here uh
 
00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
and that if if I'm well below 62 or some
 
00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:04.360 align:start position:0%
age that uh I have to wait until that
 
00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
retirement age before so again before we
 
00:34:11.470 --> 00:34:11.480 align:start position:0%
we make a decision on this one certainly
 
00:34:13.109 --> 00:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
understanding what those criteria what
 
00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
it means to the system and what it means
 
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
to the employee important sure thing
 
00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
thank you senator for the question um
 
00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:23.480 align:start position:0%
you know when we do our member education
 
00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:25.240 align:start position:0%
presentations the way we refer to
 
00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
vesting is vesting means you've earned
 
00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:30.280 align:start position:0%
the right to a future retirement benefit
 
00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
so right now it's 10 years in New
 
00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so somebody who has 10 years
 
00:34:37.149 --> 00:34:37.159 align:start position:0%
of service um you know as a full-time
 
00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
contributing member is vested in the
 
00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:42.520 align:start position:0%
system um they may be 32 years old they
 
00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
may be 59 you know it depends on when
 
00:34:46.069 --> 00:34:46.079 align:start position:0%
they started and and what kind of breaks
 
00:34:48.430 --> 00:34:48.440 align:start position:0%
and service they have so somebody being
 
00:34:49.829 --> 00:34:49.839 align:start position:0%
vested doesn't mean you can collect the
 
00:34:51.869 --> 00:34:51.879 align:start position:0%
benefit right away you need to age into
 
00:34:54.069 --> 00:34:54.079 align:start position:0%
the requirements in the respective
 
00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
groups and in the respective tiers as to
 
00:34:58.069 --> 00:34:58.079 align:start position:0%
when you become eligible ible for a
 
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
service or an early retirement things
 
00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
like that so but but it's you know
 
00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
you've got that marker in the sand I've
 
00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:06.280 align:start position:0%
got something coming to me someday you
 
00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
know um and um you know people may um
 
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
you know a longer or shorter vesting
 
00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
period May incentivize people to well
 
00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:17.640 align:start position:0%
it's only I've been here three not crazy
 
00:35:19.109 --> 00:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
about the job maybe I'll stick it out a
 
00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:21.880 align:start position:0%
couple more to get vested maybe they
 
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
like the job better in two years I mean
 
00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
I just from personal experience talking
 
00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:29.000 align:start position:0%
to to friends and and folks I run into
 
00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:31.000 align:start position:0%
you know with 10e vesting you know
 
00:35:32.589 --> 00:35:32.599 align:start position:0%
members are aware of that and if they've
 
00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:34.040 align:start position:0%
got like nine years they probably don't
 
00:35:35.829 --> 00:35:35.839 align:start position:0%
really want to leave you know no matter
 
00:35:37.109 --> 00:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
what's going on because it it
 
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
incentivizes them that there's something
 
00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
for them um regardless of um if you
 
00:35:44.589 --> 00:35:44.599 align:start position:0%
terminate employment regardless of
 
00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:47.800 align:start position:0%
whether you're vested or not um you have
 
00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
you have the option to either leave your
 
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
funds with the retirement system either
 
00:35:54.349 --> 00:35:54.359 align:start position:0%
you know in anticipation of returning at
 
00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
some point or whatever um and those fund
 
00:35:59.430 --> 00:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
get interest credited on them on a
 
00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
statutory formula so if you left your
 
00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
contribution with nhrs regardless of
 
00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
Market outcomes it wouldn't the interest
 
00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
rate can't be any lower than zero in the
 
00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
statute so you're not going to lose
 
00:36:13.829 --> 00:36:13.839 align:start position:0%
money so all of the money you put in is
 
00:36:16.349 --> 00:36:16.359 align:start position:0%
there um there there is really no
 
00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
employer match in the sense of the way
 
00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:21.800 align:start position:0%
you think about that in the 401K World
 
00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:24.200 align:start position:0%
um you know the the employers contribute
 
00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
to the fund but those contributions
 
00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
aren't you know tied to a specific
 
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
member you know they're not paying the
 
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
percentage for you know steveen Mary and
 
00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
Joe they're paying collectively for all
 
00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:37.000 align:start position:0%
of their payroll base and those employer
 
00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:39.160 align:start position:0%
funds which are also uh pulled and
 
00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
invested are used to pay everyone's
 
00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
benefit so really the only way you get
 
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
quote the employer contributions back is
 
00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
if you retire and then you outlive what
 
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
you contributed to the system you know
 
00:36:52.829 --> 00:36:52.839 align:start position:0%
which tends to be on average about 5 to
 
00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:54.920 align:start position:0%
seven years basically you think about
 
00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
the money and average worker is putting
 
00:36:59.670 --> 00:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
in over their 20 or 30-year career plus
 
00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:01.480 align:start position:0%
the interest accured on that and the
 
00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:04.280 align:start position:0%
investment income um you know after a
 
00:37:06.309 --> 00:37:06.319 align:start position:0%
certain point you know that if that was
 
00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
a private sector plan once you exhausted
 
00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
your savings you have zero this is a
 
00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
lifetime benefit um so the trust fund
 
00:37:16.589 --> 00:37:16.599 align:start position:0%
assets which the employer money goes
 
00:37:18.910 --> 00:37:18.920 align:start position:0%
into is what pays that benefit if that
 
00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
person lives to 100 and the reason that
 
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
kind of sort of works with a a large
 
00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
Pension Plan like this is for everybody
 
00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:27.640 align:start position:0%
who lives to 100 is going to be the
 
00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:29.640 align:start position:0%
unfortunate person you know who dies a
 
00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
month or two after they retire so you
 
00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:34.040 align:start position:0%
know actuar you know that's that's how
 
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
the the funding is predicated on that
 
00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
pulled um member assets um you can also
 
00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:42.040 align:start position:0%
if you terminate employment you know
 
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
after a certain um frame you can request
 
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
a refund of your accumulated
 
00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
contributions plus any interest so okay
 
00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
I got laid off I quit I'm moving acoss
 
00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:55.400 align:start position:0%
to California whatever and you know you
 
00:37:58.030 --> 00:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
have a few thousand within HRS and
 
00:38:00.069 --> 00:38:00.079 align:start position:0%
contributions if you don't want to leave
 
00:38:01.829 --> 00:38:01.839 align:start position:0%
them there you would just fill out some
 
00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:04.040 align:start position:0%
paperwork and you can roll that over
 
00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:06.640 align:start position:0%
into another uh qualified retirement
 
00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:08.200 align:start position:0%
plan with no tax impact on the
 
00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:10.280 align:start position:0%
withdrawal we can cut you a check and
 
00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:12.200 align:start position:0%
you're going to pay income tax plus a
 
00:38:14.589 --> 00:38:14.599 align:start position:0%
penalty on that if you're too young um
 
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
or you can just leave it with us so that
 
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
those are the options all members
 
00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:23.640 align:start position:0%
have thank you you Mr
 
00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
real Mr Carlin um
 
00:38:31.829 --> 00:38:31.839 align:start position:0%
would the benefit that a member receives
 
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
be relative to the years of service they
 
00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
put in meaning someone that came on into
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
this into the system now who has to work
 
00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
25 years to get 50% of their average of
 
00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
their top five years if they were to
 
00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:49.720 align:start position:0%
leave after 5% their benefit when
 
00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
they're eligible to collect it would be
 
00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
relative is that not absolutely really
 
00:38:56.309 --> 00:38:56.319 align:start position:0%
good point thank you yeah so so when
 
00:38:57.870 --> 00:38:57.880 align:start position:0%
when you know discussions of the
 
00:38:59.790 --> 00:38:59.800 align:start position:0%
multiplier you think about that is
 
00:39:01.349 --> 00:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
that's the percentage of your average
 
00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:03.160 align:start position:0%
salary that you're getting for each year
 
00:39:06.349 --> 00:39:06.359 align:start position:0%
that you worked so you know like a brand
 
00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
new group to higher tomorrow for
 
00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
instance you know if they work 25 years
 
00:39:14.349 --> 00:39:14.359 align:start position:0%
at a 2% multiplier it's 50% of their AFC
 
00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
after 25 years if you had fiveyear
 
00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
vesting somebody worked for five years
 
00:39:23.109 --> 00:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
and left 5 time 2 is 10 so they they
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
their ultimate benefit when they age
 
00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
into qualifying for it would be 10% of
 
00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
their AFC so the more the more years you
 
00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
work the bigger your benefit's going to
 
00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:32.510 align:start position:0%
work the bigger your benefit's going to
be

00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:35.069 align:start position:0%
be
yes

00:39:35.069 --> 00:39:35.079 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
followup would there
 
00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.589 align:start position:0%
followup would there
be

00:39:40.589 --> 00:39:40.599 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
um excuse me I think of the way to to
 
00:39:48.069 --> 00:39:48.079 align:start position:0%
word this here so if a member were to
 
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
leave after five years if the vesting
 
00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:53.960 align:start position:0%
were five years would there be
 
00:39:57.309 --> 00:39:57.319 align:start position:0%
variables uh that would
 
00:40:00.309 --> 00:40:00.319 align:start position:0%
impact the cost to the system or would
 
00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
the costs essentially not
 
00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:07.480 align:start position:0%
change um I I don't believe the cost
 
00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
would change because it it's you know if
 
00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:11.720 align:start position:0%
if someone was terminated and once we
 
00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
had all their final pay reported you
 
00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:15.400 align:start position:0%
know we know what their average final
 
00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
compensation was going to be and that's
 
00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
not going to change you know how many
 
00:40:19.349 --> 00:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
years they worked and what the
 
00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
multiplier was I mean I I suppose if
 
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
somebody and invested deferred in active
 
00:40:26.829 --> 00:40:26.839 align:start position:0%
status if the multiplier were increased
 
00:40:29.109 --> 00:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
or decreased and they had yet to retire
 
00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
you know that could impact the benefit
 
00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
but assuming the statutory Provisions
 
00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:35.240 align:start position:0%
don't change um you know but if if they
 
00:40:38.589 --> 00:40:38.599 align:start position:0%
do that that could have an impact very
 
00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
rarely and and not not So Much Anymore
 
00:40:42.349 --> 00:40:42.359 align:start position:0%
in the low interest interest environment
 
00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
we've seen occasionally in the past
 
00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
we've seen people who you know went into
 
00:40:50.589 --> 00:40:50.599 align:start position:0%
vested deferred status in the 80s or 90s
 
00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
uh when interest rates were higher and
 
00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:54.200 align:start position:0%
their interest on their accumulated
 
00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
contributions was greater than what
 
00:40:57.829 --> 00:40:57.839 align:start position:0%
their retirement benefit would have been
 
00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
under the formula so we calculate it you
 
00:41:02.349 --> 00:41:02.359 align:start position:0%
know based on their their accumulated
 
00:41:03.589 --> 00:41:03.599 align:start position:0%
contributions it's essentially a
 
00:41:06.309 --> 00:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
self-funded benefit but that that hasn't
 
00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:15.109 --> 00:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
now Mr martines thank you madam chair um
 
00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:17.960 align:start position:0%
we strongly support that proposal number
 
00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:21.560 align:start position:0%
three for fiveyear vesting I think this
 
00:41:25.309 --> 00:41:25.319 align:start position:0%
is really a win-win it adds value to the
 
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
retirement system
 
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
it improves Recruitment and Retention
 
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
and helps promote a good thing I think
 
00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:35.000 align:start position:0%
that we should do this and I strongly U
 
00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:36.520 align:start position:0%
recommend that and thank you for
 
00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:49.470 align:start position:0%
 
comment

00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:49.480 align:start position:0%
comment
 
00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:57.710 align:start position:0%
 
on

00:41:57.710 --> 00:41:57.720 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:42:01.349 --> 00:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you uh number four uh so
 
00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:04.760 align:start position:0%
earnable compensation so uh proposing to
 
00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
uh to add back into the um to formula
 
00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:09.800 align:start position:0%
because of course about you know 10 or
 
00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:12.920 align:start position:0%
so years ago those um payments were uh
 
00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:14.680 align:start position:0%
were no longer allowed so naturally if
 
00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
you U for those that were vested prior
 
00:42:18.349 --> 00:42:18.359 align:start position:0%
to that time they're still eligible for
 
00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:20.200 align:start position:0%
payments but for the last 10 years
 
00:42:21.549 --> 00:42:21.559 align:start position:0%
people that were vested during that time
 
00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:24.920 align:start position:0%
were not so to be able to add back in
 
00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:28.760 align:start position:0%
those um end the care your payouts um
 
00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
and just looking at it too because again
 
00:42:32.589 --> 00:42:32.599 align:start position:0%
just looking at for the theme of of
 
00:42:34.829 --> 00:42:34.839 align:start position:0%
retaining employees um that would really
 
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
be I think a strong tool to be able to
 
00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:39.720 align:start position:0%
retain employees to be able to uh and
 
00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
and it was something that was in there
 
00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:42.640 align:start position:0%
for quite some time so to be able to I
 
00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:44.200 align:start position:0%
think add because again we're I think
 
00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:45.640 align:start position:0%
we're looking at these issues with
 
00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
attraction and retention for for a
 
00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
reason so I think you know we the
 
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
pendulum went a little bit too far so if
 
00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
we can kind of bring some more of these
 
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
ideas back I think we'll we'll find
 
00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
we'll have a much easier time to uh
 
00:42:59.150 --> 00:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
retain employees if that um benefit is
 
00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:00.520 align:start position:0%
added back
 
00:43:03.549 --> 00:43:03.559 align:start position:0%
in okay thank you does anyone else have
 
00:43:03.559 --> 00:43:04.349 align:start position:0%
in okay thank you does anyone else have
a

00:43:04.349 --> 00:43:04.359 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:43:09.549 --> 00:43:09.559 align:start position:0%
comment we get um Mr Carin up yes
 
00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:22.040 align:start position:0%
Carlin spiking glad I sat close to the
 
00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
microphone so um any thoughts on what
 
00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:28.040 align:start position:0%
this is going to do
 
00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:31.000 align:start position:0%
to the system
 
00:43:35.109 --> 00:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
costs um the not specifically with group
 
00:43:37.589 --> 00:43:37.599 align:start position:0%
one but you know some of the proposals
 
00:43:40.589 --> 00:43:40.599 align:start position:0%
uh last year on the grid um dealt with
 
00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
changes to both or either average final
 
00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
compensation on a lower average or
 
00:43:48.829 --> 00:43:48.839 align:start position:0%
restoring uh some or all of those pay
 
00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:52.640 align:start position:0%
types into uh average final compensation
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
and in either according to the the
 
00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
analysis on the group two sides it
 
00:43:59.030 --> 00:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
should translate over it would add to
 
00:44:00.549 --> 00:44:00.559 align:start position:0%
the system costs
 
00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
essentially folks will be getting better
 
00:44:05.069 --> 00:44:05.079 align:start position:0%
benefits under those changes so then you
 
00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:06.920 align:start position:0%
know the the funding for that would be
 
00:44:09.069 --> 00:44:09.079 align:start position:0%
reflected in the
 
00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:13.640 align:start position:0%
rates Senator gray um if I look at this
 
00:44:18.190 --> 00:44:18.200 align:start position:0%
one that and uh the 20h hour proposal
 
00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:21.800 align:start position:0%
number two together that an employee
 
00:44:24.309 --> 00:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
could be hired on as one of these
 
00:44:26.549 --> 00:44:26.559 align:start position:0%
20-hour employees
 
00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
for a number of years and then be
 
00:44:33.069 --> 00:44:33.079 align:start position:0%
promoted to the Cook or the whatever and
 
00:44:35.589 --> 00:44:35.599 align:start position:0%
be a full-time employee and it seems
 
00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
like I would get back into that
 
00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
situation that you were talking about
 
00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
prior to that is that a person could
 
00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
work a majority of their career at a
 
00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:47.640 align:start position:0%
very low number of hours but still get
 
00:44:50.109 --> 00:44:50.119 align:start position:0%
full credit because we're only looking
 
00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
at the high X number of years and that
 
00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:57.640 align:start position:0%
would affect the benefits going going up
 
00:44:59.230 --> 00:44:59.240 align:start position:0%
or going
 
00:45:02.309 --> 00:45:02.319 align:start position:0%
further yeah that that um as I as I said
 
00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:04.720 align:start position:0%
that you know how would you treat the
 
00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
part-time service would it be a prata
 
00:45:09.109 --> 00:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
you know half a year for you know if
 
00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:10.760 align:start position:0%
there's an hourly threshold that which
 
00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
it becomes you know full-time units work
 
00:45:15.069 --> 00:45:15.079 align:start position:0%
things like that I I don't know off the
 
00:45:18.549 --> 00:45:18.559 align:start position:0%
top of my head but I I I do believe um
 
00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:21.720 align:start position:0%
some states or some sub plans within a
 
00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
state may have some part-time Provisions
 
00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:26.440 align:start position:0%
I can try to look and see if I see and
 
00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:30.440 align:start position:0%
if the there was a a desire to move
 
00:45:32.309 --> 00:45:32.319 align:start position:0%
forward with that idea I would I would
 
00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
strong as just looking at how other
 
00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:36.640 align:start position:0%
states who do that how they handle that
 
00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
it may not be the best way or may not be
 
00:45:40.829 --> 00:45:40.839 align:start position:0%
the way New Hampshire wants to do it but
 
00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
it would be sort of a baseline to to
 
00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
look at how those types of questions are
 
00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:48.280 align:start position:0%
are answered Mr martines Madam chair
 
00:45:50.829 --> 00:45:50.839 align:start position:0%
thank you and uh as I understand nobody
 
00:45:53.109 --> 00:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
here is proposing that when you go
 
00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:54.680 align:start position:0%
part-time this is going to be a
 
00:45:56.549 --> 00:45:56.559 align:start position:0%
classification that you carry for the
 
00:45:58.750 --> 00:45:58.760 align:start position:0%
rest of your life this is a lot like
 
00:46:01.349 --> 00:46:01.359 align:start position:0%
Social Security if you have a good ear
 
00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
you have a good ear then another good
 
00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
ear maybe a smaller year and in the end
 
00:46:08.069 --> 00:46:08.079 align:start position:0%
you have a pro-rated amount according to
 
00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
what you paid in that's how the program
 
00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
works this is how it's going to work for
 
00:46:15.309 --> 00:46:15.319 align:start position:0%
this and I think this is a very good
 
00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
thing mathematically this makes
 
00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
sense thank you Senator gray just a
 
00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:24.280 align:start position:0%
comment on Mr Martinez when you go and
 
00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
figure out what social security benefits
 
00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
are going to be there is a multiplier
 
00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:30.640 align:start position:0%
that the Social Security Administration
 
00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
has come up with for all of the years up
 
00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
to the year of your retirement and so
 
00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
that if you have a very small year okay
 
00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
and that multiplier is high but you know
 
00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
again because it is additive and they
 
00:46:50.349 --> 00:46:50.359 align:start position:0%
they take an average of all of that it's
 
00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
all of the years which again if you were
 
00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
saying that I was going to take all of
 
00:46:58.589 --> 00:46:58.599 align:start position:0%
the service and do the calculation that
 
00:47:01.790 --> 00:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
way I would be more interested in this
 
00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:04.640 align:start position:0%
proposal than looking at the High three
 
00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
or high five okay and again like I say
 
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
social security looks at every year if
 
00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:13.640 align:start position:0%
you worked for 40 years they look at 40
 
00:47:16.589 --> 00:47:16.599 align:start position:0%
years then they take the high 30 years
 
00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:19.880 align:start position:0%
of that and then they do the calculation
 
00:47:22.990 --> 00:47:23.000 align:start position:0%
so just as one that's on Social Security
 
00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
you know I yes thank you I know all we
 
00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:27.880 align:start position:0%
all Mr
 
00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:30.760 align:start position:0%
Ford hi Marty how are you you do uh can
 
00:47:34.589 --> 00:47:34.599 align:start position:0%
I uh can you uh explain how School
 
00:47:36.349 --> 00:47:36.359 align:start position:0%
District years of service are counted
 
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
now so like for example a teacher Works
 
00:47:41.829 --> 00:47:41.839 align:start position:0%
187 188 190 days or whatever basically
 
00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:44.720 align:start position:0%
10 months and then a person like me
 
00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
works in the central Office I work all
 
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
12 months 261 days how are those years
 
00:47:52.069 --> 00:47:52.079 align:start position:0%
of service calculated by you right now
 
00:47:54.309 --> 00:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
the retirement system sure thing yeah um
 
00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:55.880 align:start position:0%
teachers who are working on under
 
00:47:57.870 --> 00:47:57.880 align:start position:0%
contractor are considered 10-month
 
00:48:00.349 --> 00:48:00.359 align:start position:0%
employees typically you know not always
 
00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
the contracts you know 91 to 6:30 of the
 
00:48:05.309 --> 00:48:05.319 align:start position:0%
following you know it mirrors the school
 
00:48:09.630 --> 00:48:09.640 align:start position:0%
year um and for those te teachers with a
 
00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:12.200 align:start position:0%
contract get a full year of service you
 
00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
know for the school year worked if they
 
00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
do um summer school or something like
 
00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
that they don't get extra service you
 
00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
can't earn more than a year in a
 
00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
calendar year um you know but um that's
 
00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:25.640 align:start position:0%
how that works for uh employees like Mr
 
00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.079 align:start position:0%
for who are full-time you know 12 months
 
00:48:29.549 --> 00:48:29.559 align:start position:0%
of the year they get a year of service
 
00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
for their 12 months you know so when
 
00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
when when the acrs you know it's you
 
00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
know it's a for a teacher it's you know
 
00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
0.1 for each month in the school year
 
00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:38.790 align:start position:0%
0.1 for each month in the school year
it's

00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:48:41.109 --> 00:48:41.119 align:start position:0%
0.833 for everybody else so that the
 
00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
acrs end up being the same you can't get
 
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
more than a year for a year unless you
 
00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
jobs I
 
00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
see Miss
 
00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
Stacy thank you so I can tell you that I
 
00:48:57.870 --> 00:48:57.880 align:start position:0%
I I don't support this I think that it
 
00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
was going to Cost U more money to the
 
00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
employers the employers share I know
 
00:49:04.109 --> 00:49:04.119 align:start position:0%
that one of the retention tools that we
 
00:49:06.069 --> 00:49:06.079 align:start position:0%
use at Rockingham County is we have
 
00:49:08.829 --> 00:49:08.839 align:start position:0%
significant longevity pay that people
 
00:49:12.349 --> 00:49:12.359 align:start position:0%
get um and to and and and the employees
 
00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
are happy but obviously if this becomes
 
00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
part of the calculation we're going to
 
00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:19.160 align:start position:0%
be having to pay more in so I can't I
 
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
can't support this
 
00:49:25.950 --> 00:49:25.960 align:start position:0%
all I have a concern that normally the
 
00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:29.000 align:start position:0%
employer contributions are paid in over
 
00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
the entire career based on the payroll
 
00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
and therefore they have 20 or 30 or 40
 
00:49:38.349 --> 00:49:38.359 align:start position:0%
years to grow this is a payment that is
 
00:49:41.150 --> 00:49:41.160 align:start position:0%
made at the very last minute and they
 
00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
won't even earn any interest on the
 
00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:46.040 align:start position:0%
employer contribution for it but it
 
00:49:48.549 --> 00:49:48.559 align:start position:0%
boosts the pension
 
00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't seem to me like a sensible
 
00:49:55.069 --> 00:49:55.079 align:start position:0%
way for retention unless the employer
 
00:49:57.510 --> 00:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
decides to start
 
00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
paying a a portion of it prior to the
 
00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
last year to the retirement system which
 
00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:07.880 align:start position:0%
is what I believe the actuaries will
 
00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:10.680 align:start position:0%
calculate yeah uh representative McGuire
 
00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:13.720 align:start position:0%
um right right what what the x is refer
 
00:50:16.109 --> 00:50:16.119 align:start position:0%
to to those sort of large payments at
 
00:50:18.270 --> 00:50:18.280 align:start position:0%
the end in the assumptions is a load
 
00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
Factor so another for instance you know
 
00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
the TR members you know under entally
 
00:50:26.670 --> 00:50:26.680 align:start position:0%
quote the old plan pre2 11 you know they
 
00:50:30.549 --> 00:50:30.559 align:start position:0%
are getting you know uh payout of uh
 
00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
unus leave vacation other earned time
 
00:50:37.549 --> 00:50:37.559 align:start position:0%
possibly um you know sick pay as well uh
 
00:50:40.030 --> 00:50:40.040 align:start position:0%
in in that as a lumpsum maybe you know
 
00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:42.200 align:start position:0%
as well as a severance or retirement
 
00:50:44.710 --> 00:50:44.720 align:start position:0%
incentive and those are averaged into
 
00:50:47.829 --> 00:50:47.839 align:start position:0%
their High three and um you know there's
 
00:50:50.069 --> 00:50:50.079 align:start position:0%
a so even though the the rates are
 
00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
Blended among all the tiers there are
 
00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:53.960 align:start position:0%
you know there's a higher load factor
 
00:50:56.910 --> 00:50:56.920 align:start position:0%
for those to account for that so if all
 
00:50:59.270 --> 00:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
the member tiers were moved back into
 
00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
that model then that load Factor would
 
00:51:03.190 --> 00:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
apply to a larger percentage and you
 
00:51:05.109 --> 00:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
know that would the rates would would be
 
00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
higher you know for all for that you
 
00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
know you know based on past experience
 
00:51:12.270 --> 00:51:12.280 align:start position:0%
the assum the actuary can assume what
 
00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
those look like you know um and and they
 
00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
they also know if they don't count and
 
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
and with payouts like that just just to
 
00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
clarify if um again this is draw drawing
 
00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:24.680 align:start position:0%
on some of our educational presentations
 
00:51:27.950 --> 00:51:27.960 align:start position:0%
is if you are if you're entitled to that
 
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
under your CBA your personnel policy or
 
00:51:32.190 --> 00:51:32.200 align:start position:0%
anything like that you know the vacation
 
00:51:34.270 --> 00:51:34.280 align:start position:0%
payouts or whatever sick leave you're
 
00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
going to get that money the difference
 
00:51:38.190 --> 00:51:38.200 align:start position:0%
is for the people who were invested
 
00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
prior to one one of 12 it doesn't count
 
00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
in their AFC formula they neither they
 
00:51:44.670 --> 00:51:44.680 align:start position:0%
nor the employer pay contributions on
 
00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
that money um you know but you know it's
 
00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
you know we're not the law doesn't tell
 
00:51:51.390 --> 00:51:51.400 align:start position:0%
the employer they can't get that it just
 
00:51:54.190 --> 00:51:54.200 align:start position:0%
the lot says we can't count
 
00:51:58.670 --> 00:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
it okay okay anyone else Mr
 
00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:00.640 align:start position:0%
Fuller thank you actually I just wanted
 
00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:02.440 align:start position:0%
to return back to a prior comment with
 
00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
the uh I think proposal number two
 
00:52:05.069 --> 00:52:05.079 align:start position:0%
because I know we've been kind of going
 
00:52:07.549 --> 00:52:07.559 align:start position:0%
back and forth but um I know it's not in
 
00:52:08.589 --> 00:52:08.599 align:start position:0%
there because obviously it's not all the
 
00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
way drawn out but I can appreciate the
 
00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
concerns about a part-time employee then
 
00:52:14.789 --> 00:52:14.799 align:start position:0%
getting like a full-time you know
 
00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
retirement benefit and that's not the
 
00:52:18.589 --> 00:52:18.599 align:start position:0%
intent of the proposal so um I would
 
00:52:20.190 --> 00:52:20.200 align:start position:0%
certainly agree that there would need
 
00:52:22.109 --> 00:52:22.119 align:start position:0%
definitely need to be some sort of
 
00:52:24.309 --> 00:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
safeguards in that area in terms of
 
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
because I'm not advocate ating or
 
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
advancing that someone works for 20
 
00:52:29.870 --> 00:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
years parttime and then that they work
 
00:52:31.630 --> 00:52:31.640 align:start position:0%
one year full-time and they get the full
 
00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
benefit I mean that's not the intent of
 
00:52:35.349 --> 00:52:35.359 align:start position:0%
the proposal I mean to me if someone's
 
00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
working part-time then essentially they
 
00:52:39.349 --> 00:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
should get a part-time retirement
 
00:52:41.470 --> 00:52:41.480 align:start position:0%
benefit if you work full-time you get a
 
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
full-time retirement benefit at least
 
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
that's that's the intent of where I'm
 
00:52:47.829 --> 00:52:47.839 align:start position:0%
coming from and um more than happy to
 
00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
work on details or whatever else but I
 
00:52:51.549 --> 00:52:51.559 align:start position:0%
just wanted to the devil is in the
 
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
details and that would have quite a few
 
00:52:56.309 --> 00:52:56.319 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it did what you wanted
 
00:52:59.069 --> 00:52:59.079 align:start position:0%
without unintended consequences that's
 
00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:06.430 --> 00:53:06.440 align:start position:0%
else okay um
 
00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
AFC yes proposal number five thank you
 
00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:11.640 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh to change the uh AFC to
 
00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:13.400 align:start position:0%
the highest of three years for all
 
00:53:15.349 --> 00:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
members again this is going back to some
 
00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
of the changes that were made as of uh
 
00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
201 12 so um and I'm I don't have it on
 
00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
your pardon me but I believe we changeed
 
00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
it to five so to just to get it back to
 
00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
three again so um this would definitely
 
00:53:32.750 --> 00:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
be a added benefit to employees because
 
00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
be able to because uh you know in the
 
00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
last 10 years obviously those benefits
 
00:53:39.549 --> 00:53:39.559 align:start position:0%
have uh gone down quite a bit with the a
 
00:53:41.549 --> 00:53:41.559 align:start position:0%
raising it up to the average five versus
 
00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
the average three so bringing it back to
 
00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:46.240 align:start position:0%
the largest three and one other point
 
00:53:47.710 --> 00:53:47.720 align:start position:0%
that I would like to make as well is
 
00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
that just in looking at um you know most
 
00:53:52.990 --> 00:53:53.000 align:start position:0%
large public employer plans three is
 
00:53:55.349 --> 00:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
standard so uh if anything else having
 
00:53:57.230 --> 00:53:57.240 align:start position:0%
five is more of the outlier and so just
 
00:54:00.190 --> 00:54:00.200 align:start position:0%
again looking to um you know to attract
 
00:54:03.589 --> 00:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
and retain employees knowing that that
 
00:54:04.910 --> 00:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
sort of benefit would be there I think
 
00:54:07.390 --> 00:54:07.400 align:start position:0%
would be a really good move on upart
 
00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
okay Senator Bradley you had a
 
00:54:15.230 --> 00:54:15.240 align:start position:0%
comment yes thank you um I understand
 
00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
where you're coming from but this was
 
00:54:20.549 --> 00:54:20.559 align:start position:0%
one of the key reforms to curb pension
 
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
spiking um that was adopted 12 years ago
 
00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:26.240 align:start position:0%
so I would be opposed to it I think it
 
00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:30.040 align:start position:0%
would um bring back the ability to spike
 
00:54:34.510 --> 00:54:34.520 align:start position:0%
a pension and again I'd be
 
00:54:37.870 --> 00:54:37.880 align:start position:0%
opposed Mr Martine thank you madam chair
 
00:54:40.750 --> 00:54:40.760 align:start position:0%
uh just to be clear calculating an
 
00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
average of three years is not spiking a
 
00:54:45.950 --> 00:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
pension that's the way we always
 
00:54:49.150 --> 00:54:49.160 align:start position:0%
calculate them before we reduce those
 
00:54:54.430 --> 00:54:54.440 align:start position:0%
benefits to five so this is just a fair
 
00:54:57.549 --> 00:54:57.559 align:start position:0%
way that you're going to have two people
 
00:54:59.829 --> 00:54:59.839 align:start position:0%
working next to each other and the only
 
00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
difference between them is that one was
 
00:55:03.829 --> 00:55:03.839 align:start position:0%
hired before the other and they get more
 
00:55:07.109 --> 00:55:07.119 align:start position:0%
benefits because somebody's benefit was
 
00:55:09.710 --> 00:55:09.720 align:start position:0%
reduced uh I think I believe in Fair pay
 
00:55:11.950 --> 00:55:11.960 align:start position:0%
for equal work if you're doing equal
 
00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:13.720 align:start position:0%
work as a person next to you then your
 
00:55:15.349 --> 00:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
pen should be calculated the same way as
 
00:55:17.789 --> 00:55:17.799 align:start position:0%
you are because why should you create a
 
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
different class of of Citizen getting
 
00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
paid different so when we calculate a
 
00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:24.640 align:start position:0%
pension in three years we always
 
00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
calculate penion three that is until
 
00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:30.520 align:start position:0%
2011 when we overreacted and some of
 
00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:33.640 align:start position:0%
this Bill had some drastic benefit
 
00:55:36.910 --> 00:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
reduction to uh as a cost saving that
 
00:55:38.349 --> 00:55:38.359 align:start position:0%
this you know disproportionately
 
00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
affected a number of people that have
 
00:55:42.789 --> 00:55:42.799 align:start position:0%
been a promised and were performing in
 
00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
their jobs with the expectation that
 
00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
they're going to have some benefits so I
 
00:55:50.470 --> 00:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
think the right thing to do is fix what
 
00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
we broke and I think the fix isn't the
 
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
legislature we can do this
 
00:55:59.390 --> 00:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
thank you okay Senator Susi thank you
 
00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
madam chair I I just have to
 
00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
respectfully disagree with my colleague
 
00:56:07.789 --> 00:56:07.799 align:start position:0%
from the Senate um the threeyear to
 
00:56:11.870 --> 00:56:11.880 align:start position:0%
fiveyear was not what eliminated spiking
 
00:56:13.950 --> 00:56:13.960 align:start position:0%
yet another term that we don't actually
 
00:56:17.950 --> 00:56:17.960 align:start position:0%
Define but the idea was that there was a
 
00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:20.920 align:start position:0%
period of time where people were working
 
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
extra details or working more
 
00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
overtime reducing that and capping that
 
00:56:30.750 --> 00:56:30.760 align:start position:0%
is what reduced increasing your pension
 
00:56:32.670 --> 00:56:32.680 align:start position:0%
it's not whether you calculate the years
 
00:56:35.190 --> 00:56:35.200 align:start position:0%
over three years or five years so I just
 
00:56:37.710 --> 00:56:37.720 align:start position:0%
respectfully disagree um they're two
 
00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
very different things and I I certainly
 
00:56:43.109 --> 00:56:43.119 align:start position:0%
would be open to considering this
 
00:56:48.510 --> 00:56:48.520 align:start position:0%
proposal okay anyone else Mr BR uh I
 
00:56:50.349 --> 00:56:50.359 align:start position:0%
have a question for Mr Carlin if he was
 
00:56:54.150 --> 00:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
willing to take it um the when we saw
 
00:56:57.230 --> 00:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
the the the higher pensions back prior
 
00:57:00.510 --> 00:57:00.520 align:start position:0%
to the 2011 changes um it was my
 
00:57:02.029 --> 00:57:02.039 align:start position:0%
understanding that a lot of those
 
00:57:05.109 --> 00:57:05.119 align:start position:0%
changes came from uh or excuse me a lot
 
00:57:08.029 --> 00:57:08.039 align:start position:0%
of the increases at the end of the
 
00:57:10.309 --> 00:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
career over a top
 
00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
three uh had a lot to do with the buyout
 
00:57:18.549 --> 00:57:18.559 align:start position:0%
for unused vacation and sick leave is
 
00:57:21.549 --> 00:57:21.559 align:start position:0%
that accurate uh there were some I I I
 
00:57:23.190 --> 00:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
can't speak for all you know the
 
00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
pensions back then but there were some
 
00:57:28.670 --> 00:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
high-profile incidents of Fairly large
 
00:57:31.829 --> 00:57:31.839 align:start position:0%
pensions that were driven by the way
 
00:57:35.630 --> 00:57:35.640 align:start position:0%
those those payouts were um timed out
 
00:57:37.589 --> 00:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
over a period of years so they wouldn't
 
00:57:40.349 --> 00:57:40.359 align:start position:0%
exceed the 150% cap and then there was a
 
00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
case where possibly the person their
 
00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
pension was L larger than their base
 
00:57:47.549 --> 00:57:47.559 align:start position:0%
salary because the the way that the
 
00:57:49.109 --> 00:57:49.119 align:start position:0%
community allowed it to be structured
 
00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
the payouts things like that so so that
 
00:57:53.789 --> 00:57:53.799 align:start position:0%
was definitely one of the driving pieces
 
00:57:56.549 --> 00:57:56.559 align:start position:0%
in the debate um you know back in the
 
00:58:00.589 --> 00:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
late 2000s early 2010s for sure follow
 
00:58:03.069 --> 00:58:03.079 align:start position:0%
up M follow uh are
 
00:58:05.190 --> 00:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
there uh it's kind of a loaded question
 
00:58:06.430 --> 00:58:06.440 align:start position:0%
because I think I know the answer to it
 
00:58:09.349 --> 00:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
but uh there are other safeguards in
 
00:58:11.789 --> 00:58:11.799 align:start position:0%
place um to prevent what Senator
 
00:58:14.589 --> 00:58:14.599 align:start position:0%
Bradley's worried about um what we
 
00:58:16.750 --> 00:58:16.760 align:start position:0%
referred to commonly as spiking are
 
00:58:19.349 --> 00:58:19.359 align:start position:0%
there other safeguards in place whether
 
00:58:21.870 --> 00:58:21.880 align:start position:0%
it be contribution or excuse me uh
 
00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
limits or the way we use our calcul
 
00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:27.200 align:start position:0%
ations to determine whether or not
 
00:58:29.589 --> 00:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
spiking is going to occur or not yeah
 
00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
yes and and I I I'll concur with with
 
00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
Senator Susi that there is really no
 
00:58:36.109 --> 00:58:36.119 align:start position:0%
mutually agreed upon definition of of
 
00:58:38.109 --> 00:58:38.119 align:start position:0%
spiking it there was a lot of eye on the
 
00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:40.760 align:start position:0%
beholder there I I neither I nor the
 
00:58:42.789 --> 00:58:42.799 align:start position:0%
retirement system would be willing to
 
00:58:45.549 --> 00:58:45.559 align:start position:0%
Define it um for different people but
 
00:58:48.069 --> 00:58:48.079 align:start position:0%
but what you're asking about is the 150%
 
00:58:50.670 --> 00:58:50.680 align:start position:0%
earnings limitation uh and this is a
 
00:58:53.029 --> 00:58:53.039 align:start position:0%
provision that was put in back in the
 
00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
early 90s uh and what it says is your
 
00:58:58.630 --> 00:58:58.640 align:start position:0%
last year of earnable compensation that
 
00:59:02.230 --> 00:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
last 12-month block um can't be more
 
00:59:05.630 --> 00:59:05.640 align:start position:0%
than 150% of your next highest year you
 
00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
know in in your AFC any earnings over
 
00:59:11.589 --> 00:59:11.599 align:start position:0%
that 150% limit are excluded from the
 
00:59:14.430 --> 00:59:14.440 align:start position:0%
pension formula obviously if you made
 
00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
more money you'd be paid for that um and
 
00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
for the the tier a people that last 12
 
00:59:23.309 --> 00:59:23.319 align:start position:0%
months includes any end of career
 
00:59:25.109 --> 00:59:25.119 align:start position:0%
payouts those get folded into to that
 
00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
last year so that's where that kind of
 
00:59:29.589 --> 00:59:29.599 align:start position:0%
drove that up people could kiss the cap
 
00:59:31.630 --> 00:59:31.640 align:start position:0%
you know the sort of the first way
 
00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
people might sort of picture that is I'm
 
00:59:36.069 --> 00:59:36.079 align:start position:0%
going to work you know 20 hours of
 
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
overtime and double my salary in my last
 
00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
you know every week in my last year
 
00:59:41.710 --> 00:59:41.720 align:start position:0%
that's that's one way of increasing your
 
00:59:43.870 --> 00:59:43.880 align:start position:0%
benefit you know but for that TR some of
 
00:59:45.630 --> 00:59:45.640 align:start position:0%
it was those payouts any anything that's
 
00:59:47.829 --> 00:59:47.839 align:start position:0%
we call trailing wages they get folded
 
00:59:49.230 --> 00:59:49.240 align:start position:0%
into that final year so those are the
 
00:59:51.549 --> 00:59:51.559 align:start position:0%
two things that could increase that
 
00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
higher final year and then there's at
 
00:59:57.470 --> 00:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
150% cap to capture that um or to
 
00:59:59.309 --> 00:59:59.319 align:start position:0%
capture some of that and mitigate it if
 
01:00:02.190 --> 01:00:02.200 align:start position:0%
if they go over that and there's still
 
01:00:05.470 --> 01:00:05.480 align:start position:0%
the 85 I'm sorry follow uh there's still
 
01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
the 85% Rule and the
 
01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:10.640 align:start position:0%
120,000 yes yeah there is there is a
 
01:00:12.510 --> 01:00:12.520 align:start position:0%
maximum benefit limit this was added
 
01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
back in
 
01:00:18.109 --> 01:00:18.119 align:start position:0%
2011 um for anyone who was hired after
 
01:00:21.670 --> 01:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
71 of9 and not vested by one one of 12
 
01:00:23.349 --> 01:00:23.359 align:start position:0%
because it was a built on a previous
 
01:00:24.670 --> 01:00:24.680 align:start position:0%
maximum benefit that's why it has the
 
01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:27.200 align:start position:0%
weird dates um and for anybody in that
 
01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
situation that's all of tier B and C the
 
01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:34.200 align:start position:0%
maximum is 85% of their AFC or
 
01:00:37.549 --> 01:00:37.559 align:start position:0%
$120,000 whichever is lower so for
 
01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
instance a you know in group one 40 85%
 
01:00:44.109 --> 01:00:44.119 align:start position:0%
of AFC is very difficult the multiplier
 
01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
is lower so you got to work like 50
 
01:00:48.109 --> 01:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
years to get there you're more likely to
 
01:00:50.670 --> 01:00:50.680 align:start position:0%
have a the 120 is going to be what's
 
01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:53.200 align:start position:0%
going to bump up in group two it's it's
 
01:00:55.589 --> 01:00:55.599 align:start position:0%
it's less it's in the 30 to 40 year
 
01:00:59.549 --> 01:00:59.559 align:start position:0%
range to get to the 8 85% but that's um
 
01:01:01.349 --> 01:01:01.359 align:start position:0%
you know there are there are limits on
 
01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
that as well if you had a a 50-year
 
01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
employee um you know there's there's a
 
01:01:08.430 --> 01:01:08.440 align:start position:0%
point at which they'll no longer be
 
01:01:09.990 --> 01:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
contributing because they've recruited
 
01:01:12.190 --> 01:01:12.200 align:start position:0%
100% of their AFC you know through the
 
01:01:14.430 --> 01:01:14.440 align:start position:0%
years of service that that's happened
 
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's rare but not unheard
 
01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:19.589 align:start position:0%
it's it's rare but not unheard
of

01:01:19.589 --> 01:01:19.599 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
okay Mr martines thank you this is a to
 
01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
me a good reminder as to why we need to
 
01:01:28.990 --> 01:01:29.000 align:start position:0%
fix this back then we did hear a lot of
 
01:01:31.630 --> 01:01:31.640 align:start position:0%
rhetoric about a particular case of
 
01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
somebody who had a huge pent payout and
 
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
then the rhetoric was we got to fix the
 
01:01:39.309 --> 01:01:39.319 align:start position:0%
spiking the bleeding and we got to fix
 
01:01:41.349 --> 01:01:41.359 align:start position:0%
this now
 
01:01:43.829 --> 01:01:43.839 align:start position:0%
hypocritically everything was done
 
01:01:47.309 --> 01:01:47.319 align:start position:0%
except fix that problem if still today
 
01:01:50.309 --> 01:01:50.319 align:start position:0%
that classification of workers Chiefs
 
01:01:53.549 --> 01:01:53.559 align:start position:0%
can get a bonus Troopers can get bonus
 
01:01:55.589 --> 01:01:55.599 align:start position:0%
firefighters can get bonus they workers
 
01:01:58.029 --> 01:01:58.039 align:start position:0%
don't get bonus when you get out but
 
01:02:00.670 --> 01:02:00.680 align:start position:0%
that still happens so it's not even a
 
01:02:02.670 --> 01:02:02.680 align:start position:0%
case of a collateral damage where you
 
01:02:04.910 --> 01:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
fix the problem and then you have we
 
01:02:07.230 --> 01:02:07.240 align:start position:0%
didn't even fix the problem here this is
 
01:02:09.990 --> 01:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
a classic case of if it was medicine
 
01:02:12.190 --> 01:02:12.200 align:start position:0%
would be malpractice you know we went
 
01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
out and removed the wrong limb this here
 
01:02:18.789 --> 01:02:18.799 align:start position:0%
fix it was done where fix wasn't needed
 
01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
this is exactly what happened and we're
 
01:02:23.789 --> 01:02:23.799 align:start position:0%
given an opportunity to repair the the
 
01:02:25.990 --> 01:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
the problem that we cause and it can be
 
01:02:28.190 --> 01:02:28.200 align:start position:0%
done and the legislature is a plan
 
01:02:32.230 --> 01:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
sponsor and can do this thank
 
01:02:35.309 --> 01:02:35.319 align:start position:0%
you Senator
 
01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
Waters thanks Madam chair a question for
 
01:02:42.269 --> 01:02:42.279 align:start position:0%
uh Marty on on this issue of the 85% and
 
01:02:44.829 --> 01:02:44.839 align:start position:0%
120,000 um as time goes by with
 
01:02:46.910 --> 01:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
inflation and salary increases are we
 
01:02:49.510 --> 01:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
seeing any increase in the number of
 
01:02:51.430 --> 01:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
people who are hitting one of the other
 
01:02:54.510 --> 01:02:54.520 align:start position:0%
limits uh not yet Senator because
 
01:02:57.950 --> 01:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
anybody up until February of this year
 
01:03:01.309 --> 01:03:01.319 align:start position:0%
um was vested prior to 11 one of2 to be
 
01:03:04.069 --> 01:03:04.079 align:start position:0%
eligible to retire so they you know
 
01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
there there theirs can be higher we've
 
01:03:07.710 --> 01:03:07.720 align:start position:0%
we've had some retirements that were in
 
01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
excess of those amounts because they
 
01:03:11.269 --> 01:03:11.279 align:start position:0%
weren't covered under this maximum
 
01:03:13.710 --> 01:03:13.720 align:start position:0%
benefit limit um ultimately you'll
 
01:03:15.829 --> 01:03:15.839 align:start position:0%
probably start seeing that if if if
 
01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
there is a pattern or an issue it's it's
 
01:03:19.309 --> 01:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
going to present itself over the next
 
01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:22.559 align:start position:0%
few years and then going going forward
 
01:03:25.470 --> 01:03:25.480 align:start position:0%
uh there was in in House Bill 43 36
 
01:03:28.549 --> 01:03:28.559 align:start position:0%
which um got folded into hp2 there was
 
01:03:30.510 --> 01:03:30.520 align:start position:0%
there was an inflation escalator added
 
01:03:33.870 --> 01:03:33.880 align:start position:0%
to that uh maximum benefit and it was
 
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
amended out because it it added some
 
01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
bottom line cost to the uh to the to the
 
01:03:41.950 --> 01:03:41.960 align:start position:0%
proposal um you know I forget the exact
 
01:03:43.470 --> 01:03:43.480 align:start position:0%
percentage I think it was one and a half
 
01:03:45.230 --> 01:03:45.240 align:start position:0%
percent a year the
 
01:03:49.630 --> 01:03:49.640 align:start position:0%
120 120,000 would go up um so that that
 
01:03:52.029 --> 01:03:52.039 align:start position:0%
and certainly if you think think out 20
 
01:03:54.829 --> 01:03:54.839 align:start position:0%
30 years with just inflation and and you
 
01:03:56.269 --> 01:03:56.279 align:start position:0%
know what people were making 20 years
 
01:03:57.829 --> 01:03:57.839 align:start position:0%
ago what what they might be making
 
01:03:59.670 --> 01:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
though at some point that's probably
 
01:04:01.829 --> 01:04:01.839 align:start position:0%
going to be subject of of legislative
 
01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
debate yes in the future as we talked
 
01:04:07.549 --> 01:04:07.559 align:start position:0%
about that inflation escalator was worth
 
01:04:10.870 --> 01:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
60 million and that would apply to all
 
01:04:14.309 --> 01:04:14.319 align:start position:0%
employers of group two it wouldn't be a
 
01:04:18.829 --> 01:04:18.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
expense okay anyone else Senator gray um
 
01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
I guess to get my support to moving from
 
01:04:30.589 --> 01:04:30.599 align:start position:0%
5 to three there would have to be
 
01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
limitations on what would be calculated
 
01:04:38.589 --> 01:04:38.599 align:start position:0%
into the salaries for that three okay if
 
01:04:41.269 --> 01:04:41.279 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at somebody who doesn't have
 
01:04:44.309 --> 01:04:44.319 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to work details or other
 
01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
things it could be very beneficial to
 
01:04:51.150 --> 01:04:51.160 align:start position:0%
those people to be at three okay but
 
01:04:53.470 --> 01:04:53.480 align:start position:0%
someone who can whether we call it
 
01:04:56.910 --> 01:04:56.920 align:start position:0%
spiking or increase their final three
 
01:05:00.349 --> 01:05:00.359 align:start position:0%
years or whatever because of working you
 
01:05:02.589 --> 01:05:02.599 align:start position:0%
know there would need to be something in
 
01:05:05.230 --> 01:05:05.240 align:start position:0%
there that that at least got me some
 
01:05:09.430 --> 01:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
kind of a compromise okay
 
01:05:12.750 --> 01:05:12.760 align:start position:0%
um in in you know whether we're talking
 
01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
you know tier b or whether we're talking
 
01:05:17.589 --> 01:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
whatever else there you know if I'm
 
01:05:19.829 --> 01:05:19.839 align:start position:0%
going to go to three I got to get
 
01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
something back somewhere else okay uh
 
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
other than than that you know I got to
 
01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
stick with
 
01:05:30.190 --> 01:05:30.200 align:start position:0%
five because the things that we've done
 
01:05:31.829 --> 01:05:31.839 align:start position:0%
and the way we've costed this and the
 
01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
way we've looked at it you know was
 
01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
based on
 
01:05:37.789 --> 01:05:37.799 align:start position:0%
five so you know if there is some kind
 
01:05:39.829 --> 01:05:39.839 align:start position:0%
of other proposal that comes back and
 
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
says well um those three years as long
 
01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
as you're looking at the the full
 
01:05:48.910 --> 01:05:48.920 align:start position:0%
Baseline salary and your compensation
 
01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
will be based on that full line salary
 
01:05:55.150 --> 01:05:55.160 align:start position:0%
for you know without any other ads for
 
01:05:59.710 --> 01:05:59.720 align:start position:0%
years you know one two three at the end
 
01:06:01.309 --> 01:06:01.319 align:start position:0%
that that sounds like a reasonable
 
01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
compromise but again something like that
 
01:06:05.269 --> 01:06:05.279 align:start position:0%
would have to be worked out to get my
 
01:06:07.069 --> 01:06:07.079 align:start position:0%
support on
 
01:06:10.510 --> 01:06:10.520 align:start position:0%
that Mr martines thank you m chair and
 
01:06:12.269 --> 01:06:12.279 align:start position:0%
this is a quick question to the senator
 
01:06:14.549 --> 01:06:14.559 align:start position:0%
to The Honorable Senator and others can
 
01:06:17.670 --> 01:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
correct me but I would ask this would
 
01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
then instead of we use the word detail
 
01:06:22.589 --> 01:06:22.599 align:start position:0%
would you agree then that a mandatory
 
01:06:25.549 --> 01:06:25.559 align:start position:0%
overtime should be calulated in the base
 
01:06:27.269 --> 01:06:27.279 align:start position:0%
mandatory where you don't have an option
 
01:06:30.029 --> 01:06:30.039 align:start position:0%
you have to do it like in any
 
01:06:32.109 --> 01:06:32.119 align:start position:0%
negotiation uh that certainly could be
 
01:06:33.950 --> 01:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
one of the points that's brought up
 
01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:36.029 align:start position:0%
one of the points that's brought up
thank

01:06:36.029 --> 01:06:36.039 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr car just one other thing about
 
01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
AFC I it occurred to me pretty obvious
 
01:06:45.069 --> 01:06:45.079 align:start position:0%
but there there also is a formula in
 
01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
place for anybody who wasn't invested by
 
01:06:48.990 --> 01:06:49.000 align:start position:0%
one one of 12 it's called the
 
01:06:51.309 --> 01:06:51.319 align:start position:0%
compensation over base versus base pay
 
01:06:54.029 --> 01:06:54.039 align:start position:0%
this was the subject of House Bill 1587
 
01:06:56.269 --> 01:06:56.279 align:start position:0%
last year uh and it's it's
 
01:06:59.309 --> 01:06:59.319 align:start position:0%
another another layer in the benefit
 
01:07:01.510 --> 01:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
calculation formula employers now have
 
01:07:04.470 --> 01:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
to report since 2011 base pay and then
 
01:07:06.510 --> 01:07:06.520 align:start position:0%
everything else is a separate bucket and
 
01:07:08.990 --> 01:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
then that's averaged out over the the
 
01:07:10.710 --> 01:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
period for which we have data which was
 
01:07:13.829 --> 01:07:13.839 align:start position:0%
you know January 1 to 12 so that that's
 
01:07:16.750 --> 01:07:16.760 align:start position:0%
another cap issue it was it was modified
 
01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
for group two tier B last year to be a
 
01:07:20.589 --> 01:07:20.599 align:start position:0%
little more
 
01:07:23.670 --> 01:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
um favorable than the that it is for you
 
01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
know for the other group so that that's
 
01:07:27.829 --> 01:07:27.839 align:start position:0%
another along with the 150% cap and
 
01:07:30.589 --> 01:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
other things all right thank
 
01:07:33.829 --> 01:07:33.839 align:start position:0%
you one point is that if someone is
 
01:07:36.309 --> 01:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
toward the end of their career and they
 
01:07:38.349 --> 01:07:38.359 align:start position:0%
get a promotion
 
01:07:42.390 --> 01:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
which is likely toward the end of one's
 
01:07:46.349 --> 01:07:46.359 align:start position:0%
career having fiveyear AFC calculations
 
01:07:49.589 --> 01:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
would be an inducement to stay for five
 
01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
years after the promotion rather than
 
01:07:53.630 --> 01:07:53.640 align:start position:0%
three I don't know how often that
 
01:07:55.549 --> 01:07:55.559 align:start position:0%
applies wise but that's
 
01:07:59.549 --> 01:07:59.559 align:start position:0%
a yeah I I I I we
 
01:08:02.190 --> 01:08:02.200 align:start position:0%
don't I mean we have salary history for
 
01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
you know thous tens of thousands of
 
01:08:06.069 --> 01:08:06.079 align:start position:0%
members but we don't chart that or or
 
01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
the actual doesn't because it doesn't
 
01:08:09.549 --> 01:08:09.559 align:start position:0%
play in but you know it is fair to say
 
01:08:12.750 --> 01:08:12.760 align:start position:0%
unless you're maxed out on a in a
 
01:08:14.549 --> 01:08:14.559 align:start position:0%
salaried position and you're on the same
 
01:08:16.910 --> 01:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
band you know for five years typically
 
01:08:19.269 --> 01:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
people's salaries tend to increase over
 
01:08:22.950 --> 01:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
time so okay not always uh and for with
 
01:08:24.430 --> 01:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
the fiveyear too
 
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
um it is the highest five years in the
 
01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
career you know for a lot of people it
 
01:08:30.269 --> 01:08:30.279 align:start position:0%
is towards the end but if somebody was
 
01:08:32.669 --> 01:08:32.679 align:start position:0%
in a higher paying position and for
 
01:08:35.430 --> 01:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
lifestyle or Reon other reasons chose to
 
01:08:37.309 --> 01:08:37.319 align:start position:0%
take a lower paying less stressful
 
01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
position you know we're going to look at
 
01:08:40.630 --> 01:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
the entirety of their salary record and
 
01:08:42.510 --> 01:08:42.520 align:start position:0%
find those highest three or high five
 
01:08:44.550 --> 01:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
wherever they may fall if they switched
 
01:08:46.910 --> 01:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
employers things it's you know it's not
 
01:08:49.349 --> 01:08:49.359 align:start position:0%
always the last five okay thank you
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
that's just just another
 
01:08:55.149 --> 01:08:55.159 align:start position:0%
complication anyone
 
01:09:02.550 --> 01:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
else okay moving on to colas Mr uh F Mr
 
01:09:05.550 --> 01:09:05.560 align:start position:0%
Fuller you had a
 
01:09:10.870 --> 01:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh a proposal yes thank you uh let's get
 
01:09:13.709 --> 01:09:13.719 align:start position:0%
back up to number one yeah there we go
 
01:09:16.349 --> 01:09:16.359 align:start position:0%
yes so uh so colus
 
01:09:20.470 --> 01:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
um so I mean I know colas have been a
 
01:09:22.510 --> 01:09:22.520 align:start position:0%
topic that's been discussed for um for
 
01:09:25.630 --> 01:09:25.640 align:start position:0%
quite some time but um and what was
 
01:09:27.309 --> 01:09:27.319 align:start position:0%
being proposed here too again just kind
 
01:09:29.309 --> 01:09:29.319 align:start position:0%
of looking at similar States because
 
01:09:31.590 --> 01:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
again looking at so obviously be able to
 
01:09:33.309 --> 01:09:33.319 align:start position:0%
attract employees and then also retain
 
01:09:35.070 --> 01:09:35.080 align:start position:0%
them and this is kind of borrowed a lot
 
01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
from uh vermonts just so to give a
 
01:09:38.829 --> 01:09:38.839 align:start position:0%
little bit of perspective to folks so
 
01:09:40.630 --> 01:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
along with this and then just some
 
01:09:43.070 --> 01:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
thoughts here just maybe what would
 
01:09:45.510 --> 01:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
obviously what the fund would consist of
 
01:09:46.669 --> 01:09:46.679 align:start position:0%
because I mean I know there's definitely
 
01:09:48.590 --> 01:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
a problem I mean I'm not looking to it
 
01:09:50.269 --> 01:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
would be be nice to snap my fingers and
 
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
be oh yeah everyone's got a cola but you
 
01:09:53.470 --> 01:09:53.480 align:start position:0%
know there's no money there so we need
 
01:09:54.950 --> 01:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
obviously kind of raise some money to
 
01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
put some some money into it so um some
 
01:10:00.590 --> 01:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
general fund Surplus potentially um any
 
01:10:02.590 --> 01:10:02.600 align:start position:0%
other General front Appropriations and
 
01:10:05.630 --> 01:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
then looking at um investment earnings
 
01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
generated by the account as well so just
 
01:10:09.390 --> 01:10:09.400 align:start position:0%
trying to borrow from how some things
 
01:10:11.550 --> 01:10:11.560 align:start position:0%
were similarly done for other accounts
 
01:10:12.630 --> 01:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
even kind of looking at you know
 
01:10:14.470 --> 01:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
potential medical subsidies it's kind of
 
01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
IDE I'm still throwing around but just
 
01:10:17.830 --> 01:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
don't really quite all did the details
 
01:10:20.669 --> 01:10:20.679 align:start position:0%
worked out but and at the same time too
 
01:10:23.189 --> 01:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
we're looking to uh terally fund this
 
01:10:24.590 --> 01:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
because I I I know this has been
 
01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
something that's been talked about a lot
 
01:10:28.750 --> 01:10:28.760 align:start position:0%
and and I wholeheartedly agree that um
 
01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
you know things you know termly funding
 
01:10:33.149 --> 01:10:33.159 align:start position:0%
things is very important so um this is
 
01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
also why looking to do at half of CPI I
 
01:10:38.229 --> 01:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
mean in an ideal world I mean I'd love
 
01:10:40.950 --> 01:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
to propose all of CPI but I recognize
 
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
that you know um there might not be
 
01:10:44.390 --> 01:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
quite the appetite for that and again
 
01:10:46.510 --> 01:10:46.520 align:start position:0%
just kind of looking at Vermont so even
 
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
to have you know essentially like you
 
01:10:50.709 --> 01:10:50.719 align:start position:0%
know half of CPI and again this is also
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
if the funds are available so
 
01:10:56.669 --> 01:10:56.679 align:start position:0%
and really what they ask here is again
 
01:10:59.430 --> 01:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
for the nhrs kind of looking at some
 
01:11:01.709 --> 01:11:01.719 align:start position:0%
kind of assessment of what to be the
 
01:11:03.390 --> 01:11:03.400 align:start position:0%
cost of doing this and you know again
 
01:11:04.830 --> 01:11:04.840 align:start position:0%
just throwing out there five years
 
01:11:06.229 --> 01:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
because naturally it would take some
 
01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
time to be able to you know raise some
 
01:11:11.110 --> 01:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
funds to be able to to do this and to be
 
01:11:13.510 --> 01:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
able to to provide this and I just again
 
01:11:16.189 --> 01:11:16.199 align:start position:0%
just along with these other thoughts
 
01:11:17.510 --> 01:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
happened to think this would would be a
 
01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
really great tool to both for attraction
 
01:11:22.350 --> 01:11:22.360 align:start position:0%
and retention of uh state
 
01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
employees thank thank you any comments
 
01:11:30.189 --> 01:11:30.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:30.199 --> 01:11:31.790 align:start position:0%
 
Bradley

01:11:31.790 --> 01:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
Bradley
 
01:11:35.510 --> 01:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
so use of the general fund I think at
 
01:11:38.910 --> 01:11:38.920 align:start position:0%
this point in time given the YDC
 
01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
settlements which um I think most
 
01:11:46.669 --> 01:11:46.679 align:start position:0%
observers to that process think that
 
01:11:50.990 --> 01:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
the1 million that we've allocated for
 
01:11:54.629 --> 01:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
those settlements and the litigation
 
01:11:56.669 --> 01:11:56.679 align:start position:0%
is not going to be
 
01:12:02.310 --> 01:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
adequate I think that anything that um
 
01:12:06.189 --> 01:12:06.199 align:start position:0%
undermines the ability to fulfill the
 
01:12:08.950 --> 01:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
settlements that are likely to come
 
01:12:10.910 --> 01:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
forward that comes out of the general
 
01:12:15.070 --> 01:12:15.080 align:start position:0%
fund is going to be problematic so um I
 
01:12:17.669 --> 01:12:17.679 align:start position:0%
would just say that on proposal number
 
01:12:22.030 --> 01:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
one and in terms of investment um
 
01:12:24.270 --> 01:12:24.280 align:start position:0%
earnings and this is how we got into
 
01:12:27.950 --> 01:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
problems in the past where we had you
 
01:12:30.709 --> 01:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
know several good years and then the
 
01:12:33.510 --> 01:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
gain sharing happened and then suddenly
 
01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:36.280 align:start position:0%
investment returns went down and rates
 
01:12:39.990 --> 01:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
had to go up so I I that's why the
 
01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.709 align:start position:0%
had to go up so I I that's why the
actuaries

01:12:41.709 --> 01:12:41.719 align:start position:0%
actuaries
 
01:12:45.310 --> 01:12:45.320 align:start position:0%
um analyze the rates over generally a 5
 
01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
to 10 year period of time because
 
01:12:49.669 --> 01:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
there'll be fluctuations in the market
 
01:12:53.030 --> 01:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
and just trying to take Surplus in any
 
01:12:55.990 --> 01:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
given year of investment earnings and
 
01:12:58.950 --> 01:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
putting it into a cola account I think
 
01:13:02.590 --> 01:13:02.600 align:start position:0%
is problematic um to me if we're going
 
01:13:05.870 --> 01:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
to fund a cola it is something that has
 
01:13:10.149 --> 01:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
to be an agreement between employers and
 
01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:13.480 align:start position:0%
employees as to how a rate structure for
 
01:13:16.590 --> 01:13:16.600 align:start position:0%
both sides of the equation um is going
 
01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
to change
 
01:13:21.629 --> 01:13:21.639 align:start position:0%
obviously um you know there would be
 
01:13:24.669 --> 01:13:24.679 align:start position:0%
some pain for employers and employees
 
01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
but that to me is the way if we're going
 
01:13:32.510 --> 01:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:34.590 --> 01:13:34.600 align:start position:0%
for Mr
 
01:13:36.790 --> 01:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
martines thank you madam
 
01:13:40.390 --> 01:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
chair uh I'm looking at this at a much
 
01:13:44.950 --> 01:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
simpler way the way I look at it is in
 
01:13:48.510 --> 01:13:48.520 align:start position:0%
2011 we raised contribution by 2% with
 
01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
no actra
 
01:13:53.189 --> 01:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
benefits we are more than a decade after
 
01:13:55.470 --> 01:13:55.480 align:start position:0%
this is as far as I'm concerned this
 
01:13:58.430 --> 01:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
Coler is already paid for we paid it
 
01:14:00.669 --> 01:14:00.679 align:start position:0%
already that's that's the way I look at
 
01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
it another alternative to my thought
 
01:14:06.470 --> 01:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
number two would be to refund the 2% to
 
01:14:08.189 --> 01:14:08.199 align:start position:0%
the workers that paid that without the
 
01:14:11.390 --> 01:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
actual benefit at that point we did
 
01:14:13.510 --> 01:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
close the coal account we talked about
 
01:14:15.709 --> 01:14:15.719 align:start position:0%
coming up with a fix and with a solution
 
01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
with that and everybody really thought
 
01:14:19.950 --> 01:14:19.960 align:start position:0%
this was going to happen but here we are
 
01:14:23.910 --> 01:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
in 2022 2020 23 thinking about we need
 
01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
to take a collection and raise taxes and
 
01:14:30.390 --> 01:14:30.400 align:start position:0%
then you know this is a a way to get rid
 
01:14:33.110 --> 01:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
of it with a sticker shock I'd simply
 
01:14:37.510 --> 01:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
say we got this we paid and we should do
 
01:14:40.750 --> 01:14:40.760 align:start position:0%
this thank you
 
01:14:44.510 --> 01:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
okay yes Senator Waters thank Madam
 
01:14:47.310 --> 01:14:47.320 align:start position:0%
chair this a a question for Senator
 
01:14:49.350 --> 01:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
Bradley I mean I I hear your concerns
 
01:14:52.270 --> 01:14:52.280 align:start position:0%
about this and you know frankly we can
 
01:14:53.790 --> 01:14:53.800 align:start position:0%
any given year do we want with the
 
01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
general fund just and put the money
 
01:15:00.189 --> 01:15:00.199 align:start position:0%
where we want but um I wondered Senator
 
01:15:02.709 --> 01:15:02.719 align:start position:0%
Bradley that if we had a proposal that
 
01:15:04.550 --> 01:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
said that you know given all the
 
01:15:06.709 --> 01:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
concerns about the
 
01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
employers that if such a plan were set
 
01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
up that the match of the employee
 
01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
contribution would be made by the state
 
01:15:18.030 --> 01:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
and that would be a way of not passing
 
01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
the burden Shifting the burden down to
 
01:15:22.270 --> 01:15:22.280 align:start position:0%
the employers but the state would have
 
01:15:23.709 --> 01:15:23.719 align:start position:0%
the option of deciding
 
01:15:27.390 --> 01:15:27.400 align:start position:0%
in a given year whether um you know
 
01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
there would be funding that could be put
 
01:15:30.790 --> 01:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
into such an account I I think we kind
 
01:15:33.629 --> 01:15:33.639 align:start position:0%
of need to know from Mr Carlin at some
 
01:15:35.709 --> 01:15:35.719 align:start position:0%
point I mean how much money do we have
 
01:15:39.990 --> 01:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
to get into this such an account over
 
01:15:42.510 --> 01:15:42.520 align:start position:0%
how what period of time in order to do
 
01:15:44.149 --> 01:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
any kind of terminal funding if I is
 
01:15:45.709 --> 01:15:45.719 align:start position:0%
Meaningful but that would be another way
 
01:15:47.310 --> 01:15:47.320 align:start position:0%
to go the state would match with the
 
01:15:50.149 --> 01:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
employees go forward
 
01:15:53.310 --> 01:15:53.320 align:start position:0%
so um Marty maybe you can refresh my
 
01:15:56.910 --> 01:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
memory when I think it was in 2019 or 20
 
01:15:59.750 --> 01:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
there was uh 1.5%
 
01:16:05.189 --> 01:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
Cola um what was the cost of
 
01:16:08.550 --> 01:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
that uh that the the unfunded piece of
 
01:16:10.390 --> 01:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
that was I
 
01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:13.679 align:start position:0%
um I I pretty comfortable in saying it
 
01:16:16.709 --> 01:16:16.719 align:start position:0%
was in the vicinity of 67 to70 million
 
01:16:19.669 --> 01:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
and and I was just looking up that Cola
 
01:16:23.229 --> 01:16:23.239 align:start position:0%
that the one passed in 2019 effective 7
 
01:16:26.830 --> 01:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
one of 20 was 1 a half% on the first
 
01:16:29.870 --> 01:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
50,000 of annual benefit to all members
 
01:16:33.270 --> 01:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
who retired honor before uh July 1st of
 
01:16:35.830 --> 01:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
14 so would been retired five years or
 
01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
more and that was about again 67 to 70
 
01:16:44.830 --> 01:16:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:47.310 --> 01:16:47.320 align:start position:0%
prefunding into the employer rates to be
 
01:16:49.189 --> 01:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
paid off in a 20-year layer so we're a
 
01:16:50.790 --> 01:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
few years into paying paying that one
 
01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:52.070 align:start position:0%
few years into paying paying that one
off

01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
off
 
01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:53.590 align:start position:0%
off
now

01:16:53.590 --> 01:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:16:57.510 --> 01:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
so I guess my point Senator is that it's
 
01:17:00.070 --> 01:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
pretty expensive and
 
01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:03.550 align:start position:0%
pretty expensive and
to

01:17:03.550 --> 01:17:03.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:06.270 --> 01:17:06.280 align:start position:0%
um dedicate
 
01:17:09.910 --> 01:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
prospectively um a general fund match
 
01:17:12.830 --> 01:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
would be I think problematic
 
01:17:15.790 --> 01:17:15.800 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to also comment that this
 
01:17:17.950 --> 01:17:17.960 align:start position:0%
depends on the general fund having a
 
01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:19.189 align:start position:0%
depends on the general fund having a
significant

01:17:19.189 --> 01:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
significant
 
01:17:22.430 --> 01:17:22.440 align:start position:0%
Surplus and this bium I believe it
 
01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:24.910 align:start position:0%
Surplus and this bium I believe it
doesn't

01:17:24.910 --> 01:17:24.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
01:17:27.270 --> 01:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
um and we never know what's going to
 
01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
happen in the next bium so this would
 
01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
be even if it were set up it would be a
 
01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:35.149 align:start position:0%
be even if it were set up it would be a
very

01:17:35.149 --> 01:17:35.159 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
chancy form of a cost of living increase
 
01:17:39.870 --> 01:17:39.880 align:start position:0%
because my expectation would be the
 
01:17:41.790 --> 01:17:41.800 align:start position:0%
Surplus would go down when inflation
 
01:17:44.430 --> 01:17:44.440 align:start position:0%
goes up so you'd have less money when
 
01:17:45.790 --> 01:17:45.800 align:start position:0%
you needed it
 
01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:50.590 align:start position:0%
you needed it
more

01:17:50.590 --> 01:17:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:56.750 --> 01:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:59.390 --> 01:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
okay I mean again I'll
 
01:18:02.470 --> 01:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
reiterate I think your Co is a good idea
 
01:18:04.990 --> 01:18:05.000 align:start position:0%
but it's something that has to be
 
01:18:07.950 --> 01:18:07.960 align:start position:0%
reflected in an agreement between in my
 
01:18:09.830 --> 01:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
opinion employers and
 
01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
employees on how the contribution levels
 
01:18:16.430 --> 01:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
would be set to pay for
 
01:18:19.430 --> 01:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
it okay
 
01:18:23.790 --> 01:18:23.800 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to reiterate that
 
01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
there are tax advantage savings plans
 
01:18:29.070 --> 01:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
available to everybody no matter whether
 
01:18:31.830 --> 01:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
they work for the state or for a
 
01:18:34.629 --> 01:18:34.639 align:start position:0%
different place and many employees are
 
01:18:37.350 --> 01:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
using them and that's a worthwhile way
 
01:18:42.110 --> 01:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
to save for a postretirement cost of
 
01:18:46.270 --> 01:18:46.280 align:start position:0%
living um matches are dependent
 
01:18:51.390 --> 01:18:51.400 align:start position:0%
on negotiations or in the case of state
 
01:18:54.590 --> 01:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
employees a stat statute change to to
 
01:18:58.510 --> 01:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
authorize that but they they can be made
 
01:19:00.310 --> 01:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
and it's not
 
01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:02.270 align:start position:0%
and it's not
as

01:19:02.270 --> 01:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:19:05.550 --> 01:19:05.560 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't require a great deal of
 
01:19:08.110 --> 01:19:08.120 align:start position:0%
effort to set something like that
 
01:19:12.110 --> 01:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
up the current plan is ad hoc payments
 
01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
from the retirement system that when the
 
01:19:18.510 --> 01:19:18.520 align:start position:0%
legislature is concerned enough that the
 
01:19:21.550 --> 01:19:21.560 align:start position:0%
retirees need a benef an increase we
 
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
come up with something
 
01:19:25.669 --> 01:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
sometimes we pay for it sometimes we
 
01:19:28.189 --> 01:19:28.199 align:start position:0%
dump it on the towns and other
 
01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
employers but it's a onetime payment and
 
01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:33.110 align:start position:0%
employers but it's a onetime payment and
it

01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:19:36.350 --> 01:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
is for the last decade or so most of
 
01:19:38.629 --> 01:19:38.639 align:start position:0%
them have not been in increases in the
 
01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
base pension they've been one-time
 
01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
payments of some sort and they've been
 
01:19:45.310 --> 01:19:45.320 align:start position:0%
limited generally to the
 
01:19:48.030 --> 01:19:48.040 align:start position:0%
lower lower paid
 
01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
retirees and then there are a whole lot
 
01:19:53.870 --> 01:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
of other plans uh Mr Fullers being one
 
01:19:56.790 --> 01:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
being one type the sep the special
 
01:19:59.229 --> 01:19:59.239 align:start position:0%
account that we used to have is a
 
01:20:01.350 --> 01:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
different type
 
01:20:04.470 --> 01:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
um but those all get relatively
 
01:20:06.830 --> 01:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
complicated to do what what you
 
01:20:12.390 --> 01:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
want um anyone else have a comment on Co
 
01:20:14.470 --> 01:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
colas Senator
 
01:20:17.110 --> 01:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
Waters thank thank you madam chair and
 
01:20:21.030 --> 01:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh you know as you know from the desal
 
01:20:23.030 --> 01:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
commission both you and I kind of and
 
01:20:25.870 --> 01:20:25.880 align:start position:0%
your subsequent bills on the ideas about
 
01:20:29.350 --> 01:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
an opt out instead of an opt in um
 
01:20:32.550 --> 01:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
haven't gotten much traction but um you
 
01:20:34.790 --> 01:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
know I do think there is potentially
 
01:20:37.910 --> 01:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
another option where we set up a you
 
01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:40.679 align:start position:0%
know kind of um postretirement type of
 
01:20:44.470 --> 01:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
supplemental account and that
 
01:20:47.870 --> 01:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
um have the opt out option on it and
 
01:20:50.350 --> 01:20:50.360 align:start position:0%
that here again that it might be set at
 
01:20:52.910 --> 01:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
a fairly low level but that the employes
 
01:20:55.550 --> 01:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
the contribution might be matched by a
 
01:20:57.550 --> 01:20:57.560 align:start position:0%
state contribution particularly to that
 
01:20:59.430 --> 01:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
I don't think it would be a lot of money
 
01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
over you know in a given year but that
 
01:21:04.149 --> 01:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
is another way to to get at people to
 
01:21:06.830 --> 01:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
participate in in something that I
 
01:21:08.310 --> 01:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
personally think everybody should do but
 
01:21:11.070 --> 01:21:11.080 align:start position:0%
you know that we we haven't gotten a
 
01:21:14.229 --> 01:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
traction on that one concern is that
 
01:21:16.270 --> 01:21:16.280 align:start position:0%
most of the members of retirement system
 
01:21:17.950 --> 01:21:17.960 align:start position:0%
do not work for the
 
01:21:21.390 --> 01:21:21.400 align:start position:0%
state the largest group is
 
01:21:24.030 --> 01:21:24.040 align:start position:0%
Teachers um then there's state employees
 
01:21:27.149 --> 01:21:27.159 align:start position:0%
and other local employees group two is
 
01:21:29.310 --> 01:21:29.320 align:start position:0%
almost entirely working for the towns
 
01:21:32.030 --> 01:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
and cities I mean we've got the state
 
01:21:34.510 --> 01:21:34.520 align:start position:0%
police and the conservation officers in
 
01:21:36.189 --> 01:21:36.199 align:start position:0%
corrections but most of the rest are
 
01:21:39.350 --> 01:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
working for other units so we can't make
 
01:21:42.750 --> 01:21:42.760 align:start position:0%
a blanket agreement unless we get all of
 
01:21:46.310 --> 01:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
the re relevant employers to do so yeah
 
01:21:48.750 --> 01:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
if I may I I I understand that but it
 
01:21:51.149 --> 01:21:51.159 align:start position:0%
also kind of is a backd door way of
 
01:21:52.830 --> 01:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
getting at the concerns of of
 
01:21:55.590 --> 01:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities about downshifting and
 
01:21:57.950 --> 01:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
you know the original kind of pullback
 
01:21:59.590 --> 01:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
of the state from providing certain
 
01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
kinds of funding and this is you know
 
01:22:04.149 --> 01:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
another way of kind of recognizing that
 
01:22:07.350 --> 01:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
but perhaps a simpler and less expensive
 
01:22:09.310 --> 01:22:09.320 align:start position:0%
way of getting out a very particular
 
01:22:13.310 --> 01:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
issue well if you have a specific
 
01:22:16.669 --> 01:22:16.679 align:start position:0%
plan we would love to hear hear it and
 
01:22:19.070 --> 01:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll analyze it and throw darts
 
01:22:21.550 --> 01:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
at it just like we have the
 
01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:23.149 align:start position:0%
at it just like we have the
others

01:22:23.149 --> 01:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
others
 
01:22:26.070 --> 01:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
but we we it would be a good idea to
 
01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
have a some other plans that we could
 
01:22:31.189 --> 01:22:31.199 align:start position:0%
see see what they're looking for how
 
01:22:32.709 --> 01:22:32.719 align:start position:0%
much they
 
01:22:32.719 --> 01:22:35.709 align:start position:0%
much they
cost

01:22:35.709 --> 01:22:35.719 align:start position:0%
