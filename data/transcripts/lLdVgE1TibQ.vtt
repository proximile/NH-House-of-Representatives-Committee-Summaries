Austin with our Administration we have

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 align:start position:0%
federal intergovernmental unit

thank you
 
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.510 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:52.259 align:start position:0%
so our
 
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
um it's really the mission of the Bureau
 
00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:57.419 align:start position:0%
of Child Support Services to encourage
 
00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
responsible parenting and Family
 
00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 align:start position:0%
self-sufficiency and Child well-being
 
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
and we do this by providing our core
 
00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:08.039 align:start position:0%
services to the our families and that's
 
00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:10.919 align:start position:0%
with locating parents establishing
 
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220 align:start position:0%
paternity or legal fatherhood modifying
 
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 align:start position:0%
enforcing child support obligations and
 
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 align:start position:0%
obtaining child and medical support for
 
00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.810 align:start position:0%
obtaining child and medical support for
children

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:20.820 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340 align:start position:0%
so we really believe that it's the
 
00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:25.919 align:start position:0%
responsibility of parents to financially
 
00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
support their children and we aim to
 
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
provide quality service to helping
 
00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:32.759 align:start position:0%
parents through challenging
 
00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:34.210 align:start position:0%
parents through challenging
circumstances

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:34.220 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020 align:start position:0%
concerning child support
 
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180 align:start position:0%
one of our primary roles is to help
 
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
families navigate child support which
 
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:44.220 align:start position:0%
can be at times complex and so we find
 
00:06:47.809 --> 00:06:47.819 align:start position:0%
our a lot of our work around educating
 
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
our parents and our families and trying
 
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:54.180 align:start position:0%
to connect them with the correct means
 
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
of services within the community and in
 
00:06:59.570 --> 00:06:59.580 align:start position:0%
to be able to provide the best outcomes
 
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:05.809 --> 00:07:05.819 align:start position:0%
so as I mentioned that you know the
 
00:07:08.809 --> 00:07:08.819 align:start position:0%
child support every state is required by
 
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
our federal government to have a child
 
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
support program and to implement a state
 
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
plan to provide those services and
 
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:17.940 align:start position:0%
really the child support program was
 
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
created to ensure that children and
 
00:07:22.249 --> 00:07:22.259 align:start position:0%
single parent family households received
 
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:24.300 align:start position:0%
a reliable source of Private Financial
 
00:07:26.409 --> 00:07:26.419 align:start position:0%
and medical support
 
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:29.340 align:start position:0%
the child support program really serves
 
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
you know all families from all
 
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic backgrounds and in our
 
00:07:38.029 --> 00:07:38.039 align:start position:0%
federal fiscal year of 2021 here in New
 
00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire our child support program
 
00:07:41.529 --> 00:07:41.539 align:start position:0%
served about 33
 
00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
650 Children and Families
 
00:07:47.749 --> 00:07:47.759 align:start position:0%
so our federal office of Child Support
 
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
Administration really oversees the child
 
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
support program and provides a
 
00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:55.020 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of support to our
 
00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:55.990 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of support to our
states

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:07:59.210 --> 00:07:59.220 align:start position:0%
to help us develop manage and operate
 
00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:01.620 align:start position:0%
our program according to our federal
 
00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.409 align:start position:0%
our program according to our federal
laws

00:08:03.409 --> 00:08:03.419 align:start position:0%
laws
 
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
um and the child support program has
 
00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:09.900 align:start position:0%
really evolved over the years to become
 
00:08:13.129 --> 00:08:13.139 align:start position:0%
more flexible more efficient more
 
00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
modernized and our federal government
 
00:08:19.089 --> 00:08:19.099 align:start position:0%
has issued rulings to help
 
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:22.500 align:start position:0%
support the states in being able to
 
00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:25.460 align:start position:0%
provide that flexibility to families
 
00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
you know families have um interest have
 
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
differences in structures and supports
 
00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:34.740 align:start position:0%
and needs and so the child support
 
00:08:36.889 --> 00:08:36.899 align:start position:0%
programs recognize the need to be able
 
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
to be flexible and to modernize and to
 
00:08:41.089 --> 00:08:41.099 align:start position:0%
keep up with the changes and the
 
00:08:42.649 --> 00:08:42.659 align:start position:0%
challenges that families are facing
 
00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
today so
 
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:48.540 align:start position:0%
um you know in New Hampshire
 
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:51.720 align:start position:0%
um our child support program is
 
00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
um working to be able to fulfill those
 
00:08:58.490 --> 00:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
needs for our families here and
 
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
um just to note that you know our
 
00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:02.519 align:start position:0%
program is um
 
00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
we collect and distribute private and
 
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
not government funds to families so to
 
00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
help them pay and support their children
 
00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:13.380 align:start position:0%
and meet the basic needs
 
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:14.210 align:start position:0%
and meet the basic needs
um

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:14.220 align:start position:0%

00:09:17.389 --> 00:09:17.399 align:start position:0%
we our services are provided to families
 
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
whose parents or caretakers don't reside
 
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
in the household and so we spend time
 
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
trying to ensure that families are aware
 
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:29.640 align:start position:0%

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
there are part of our role is to ensure
 
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
that those parents who are unwilling to
 
00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:49.620 align:start position:0%
pay child support who are obligated to
 
00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:51.060 align:start position:0%
do so
 
00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:51.790 align:start position:0%
do so
um

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:51.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
that we work to try to compel them to
 
00:09:59.570 --> 00:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
pay and provide that support we
 
00:10:02.509 --> 00:10:02.519 align:start position:0%
certainly have a number of tools
 
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
available to us to assist the program
 
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
um in doing so and sometimes there are
 
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
circumstances where parents are willing
 
00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:14.940 align:start position:0%
but unable to and so there may be a
 
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:16.860 align:start position:0%
barrier that is
 
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
um interfering with their ability to pay
 
00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
so the program really focuses on trying
 
00:10:24.769 --> 00:10:24.779 align:start position:0%
to identify what those barriers are to
 
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:28.140 align:start position:0%
help reduce those and provide any
 
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
um services or referrals to area
 
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
agencies or local services within the
 
00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:36.959 align:start position:0%
communities to help families reduce some
 
00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:39.660 align:start position:0%
of those barriers so the program is
 
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
really uh has to be pretty equipped with
 
00:10:44.329 --> 00:10:44.339 align:start position:0%
understanding what services are
 
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
available to families to help them to
 
00:10:50.269 --> 00:10:50.279 align:start position:0%
overcome some of those challenges
 
00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
um certainly you know we do run into
 
00:10:54.889 --> 00:10:54.899 align:start position:0%
circumstances where parents are just
 
00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
unwilling but are able and in those
 
00:10:59.389 --> 00:10:59.399 align:start position:0%
circumstances we do have enforcement
 
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
authorities that assist us in being able
 
00:11:03.949 --> 00:11:03.959 align:start position:0%
to compel them to comply with their
 
00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
child support order
 
00:11:08.569 --> 00:11:08.579 align:start position:0%
so the child support program also
 
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
services and helps to reduce families
 
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
needs to rely on or need Public
 
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
Assistance whenever possible certainly
 
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
in circumstances where families are in
 
00:11:23.449 --> 00:11:23.459 align:start position:0%
need of a temporary Public Assistance
 
00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:27.060 align:start position:0%
through any of our benefit programs that
 
00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
you know child support is a requirement
 
00:11:32.269 --> 00:11:32.279 align:start position:0%
of their eligibility and so we will work
 
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
with them and assist them with obtaining
 
00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:38.060 align:start position:0%
child support orders and assisting to
 
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:40.860 align:start position:0%
offset some of the costs that the state
 
00:11:43.009 --> 00:11:43.019 align:start position:0%
may incur as a result of that through
 
00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:45.540 align:start position:0%
their child support orders
 
00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
you know in uh I think it's important to
 
00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
also note and sometimes that
 
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
um in in order for an individual to
 
00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
receive our services through um the
 
00:11:59.090 --> 00:11:59.100 align:start position:0%
Bureau of child support that they do in
 
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
fact have to apply for our services so
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
even with a court ordered obligation
 
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
that may be payable through the Bureau
 
00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
of Child Support Services our program
 
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:10.740 align:start position:0%
does require an application process and
 
00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:13.980 align:start position:0%
we are doing we have uh opportunities
 
00:12:17.569 --> 00:12:17.579 align:start position:0%
for folks to access information and
 
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
resources that are available to them out
 
00:12:22.009 --> 00:12:22.019 align:start position:0%
on our website to help guide them in
 
00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
accessing the services that we might be
 
00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:27.180 align:start position:0%
able to provide we do also provide
 
00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:28.150 align:start position:0%
able to provide we do also provide
services

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
to parents that live across state
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
borders in tribal communities and
 
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
internationally so we're not
 
00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:38.389 align:start position:0%
internationally so we're not
um

00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:42.180 align:start position:0%
uh so we we try to provide services on a
 
00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:43.620 align:start position:0%
global basis
 
00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
so I would like to just um highlight
 
00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
um a little bit of some of the again
 
00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
some of the core functions that the
 
00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:52.970 align:start position:0%
some of the core functions that the
program

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:52.980 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:12:56.269 --> 00:12:56.279 align:start position:0%
um provides one of the programs one of
 
00:12:58.610 --> 00:12:58.620 align:start position:0%
the services we offers is we locate
 
00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:01.860 align:start position:0%
parents so parents who are outside of
 
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
the single family household if they need
 
00:13:07.069 --> 00:13:07.079 align:start position:0%
assistance we can use a variety of
 
00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:09.240 align:start position:0%
systems that we interface with to try to
 
00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
locate parents so that they can become
 
00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
involved in their child's life and or we
 
00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:16.860 align:start position:0%
can work to establish uh paternity or
 
00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
legal fatherhood in circumstances where
 
00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:24.060 align:start position:0%
that may be needed and that is again one
 
00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:27.180 align:start position:0%
of the poor services that we provide we
 
00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:30.300 align:start position:0%
also work with our
 
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
our families to establish the child
 
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
support orders and medical support
 
00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
orders here in New Hampshire all of that
 
00:13:40.129 --> 00:13:40.139 align:start position:0%
is done in collaboration with our New
 
00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:42.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Circuit Family Division
 
00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
the since uh here in New Hampshire we
 
00:13:47.629 --> 00:13:47.639 align:start position:0%
use a judicial process the port is
 
00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
really a a good collaborator with the
 
00:13:53.269 --> 00:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
bureau and we work very closely with our
 
00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:55.740 align:start position:0%
court partners
 
00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
and as I mentioned we enforce child
 
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
support and medical support orders
 
00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:03.300 align:start position:0%
um and it you know again it's really the
 
00:14:05.389 --> 00:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the parent that's
 
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
obligated to pay to be able to comply
 
00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:09.720 align:start position:0%
with that and we really see that it's
 
00:14:11.629 --> 00:14:11.639 align:start position:0%
our role and responsibility when we're
 
00:14:14.629 --> 00:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
working with families to ensure that
 
00:14:18.769 --> 00:14:18.779 align:start position:0%
they uh have uh the means to be able to
 
00:14:21.949 --> 00:14:21.959 align:start position:0%
do so and if they are unable to do so
 
00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:25.740 align:start position:0%
then we can act on some of the
 
00:14:27.949 --> 00:14:27.959 align:start position:0%
enforcement authorities that we have
 
00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:30.180 align:start position:0%
available to us
 
00:14:32.269 --> 00:14:32.279 align:start position:0%
um such as you know a recreational
 
00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:34.940 align:start position:0%
professional license revocation
 
00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:39.839 align:start position:0%
liens on income withholding order for
 
00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:43.980 align:start position:0%
wage garnishments and payments and if
 
00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
needed and necessary we can certainly
 
00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
utilize the court to assist us in
 
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
ensuring that an oblivore or a person
 
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
responsible to pay support
 
00:14:59.569 --> 00:14:59.579 align:start position:0%
is able to do so through those means
 
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
I think what's important to note here is
 
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
that the bureau really tries to take a
 
00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:07.100 align:start position:0%
progressive approach to engaging our um
 
00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
obligor or obligated population to pay
 
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
we really try to engage with our
 
00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:15.959 align:start position:0%
customers to comply and as I mentioned
 
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:19.740 align:start position:0%
previously to really be able to identify
 
00:15:22.009 --> 00:15:22.019 align:start position:0%
what those barriers might be and make
 
00:15:24.889 --> 00:15:24.899 align:start position:0%
sure they have the resources to access
 
00:15:26.629 --> 00:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
those um
 
00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
to access them to be able to alleviate
 
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
those barriers so they can be in
 
00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
compliance and provide them with the
 
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:34.980 align:start position:0%
choices that they need to be able to be
 
00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:36.660 align:start position:0%
successful for the benefit of their
 
00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:37.670 align:start position:0%
successful for the benefit of their
children

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
and of course our program collects and
 
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
disperses child support payments we have
 
00:15:46.189 --> 00:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
a sophisticated
 
00:15:50.389 --> 00:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
um child support system automated system
 
00:15:54.769 --> 00:15:54.779 align:start position:0%
that interfaces with a variety of
 
00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
of um different state and federal
 
00:15:59.519 --> 00:16:00.769 align:start position:0%
of um different state and federal
um

00:16:00.769 --> 00:16:00.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
um partners that allows us to be able to
 
00:16:05.329 --> 00:16:05.339 align:start position:0%
collect and distribute and keep accurate
 
00:16:07.689 --> 00:16:07.699 align:start position:0%
records of our
 
00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:10.980 align:start position:0%
payments for the our families
 
00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:14.100 align:start position:0%
and here in New Hampshire as in many in
 
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
all states we have a state disbursement
 
00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:19.100 align:start position:0%
unit where all those payments are
 
00:16:23.449 --> 00:16:23.459 align:start position:0%
collected and um dispersed from
 
00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
and we have a provision in place where
 
00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
all payments are required to be
 
00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
distributed and dispersed within 48
 
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
hours to our families
 
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:41.820 align:start position:0%
in addition to the court being a um a
 
00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
stakeholder that um The Bureau works
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
with certainly our employer Community is
 
00:16:50.449 --> 00:16:50.459 align:start position:0%
also a big stakeholder for the Bureau of
 
00:16:52.189 --> 00:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
Child Support Services where we want to
 
00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:54.660 align:start position:0%
work really closely with our employers
 
00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire specifically in
 
00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
our last Federal fiscal year of 2021 71
 
00:17:05.169 --> 00:17:05.179 align:start position:0%
percent of our collections that we
 
00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
collect are from income withholding
 
00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
orders so it's really important that our
 
00:17:14.809 --> 00:17:14.819 align:start position:0%
program continue to work closely with
 
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
our employer community
 
00:17:20.809 --> 00:17:20.819 align:start position:0%
and we also of course as I mentioned
 
00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:23.339 align:start position:0%
um collaborate with many other state
 
00:17:26.289 --> 00:17:26.299 align:start position:0%
department agencies as well as other
 
00:17:28.669 --> 00:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
non-governmental agencies as well to
 
00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:34.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:35.150 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
you know the child support program as I
 
00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:39.900 align:start position:0%
mentioned has been transforming and
 
00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:42.140 align:start position:0%
we're really promoting a real
 
00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:44.700 align:start position:0%
family-centered approach to strengthen
 
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
parents abilities to become more
 
00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:51.720 align:start position:0%
self-sufficient and to be able to
 
00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:53.940 align:start position:0%
support and care for their children try
 
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
to reduce any stressors that may be
 
00:17:58.610 --> 00:17:58.620 align:start position:0%
impacting but really you know at the
 
00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:01.020 align:start position:0%
core in the heart of it our role is to
 
00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:02.940 align:start position:0%
really ensure that the child and medical
 
00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:05.340 align:start position:0%
support obligations that are ordered
 
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire are being
 
00:18:09.549 --> 00:18:09.559 align:start position:0%
fulfilled and are being
 
00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
provided to to the children and families
 
00:18:15.669 --> 00:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
we do work with a number of Outreach
 
00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:18.620 align:start position:0%
groups and
 
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
individuals to help promote the services
 
00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
that we offer because we recognize that
 
00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
families are in
 
00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:29.700 align:start position:0%
have a number of challenges in raising
 
00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:32.580 align:start position:0%
children today so we really want to be
 
00:18:35.289 --> 00:18:35.299 align:start position:0%
able to provide assistance to both
 
00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:39.720 align:start position:0%
families both both parents excuse me and
 
00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
really assist them through navigating
 
00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:43.919 align:start position:0%
the child support process wherever we
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
can so we have a very dedicated and
 
00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
confident and professional Workforce and
 
00:18:54.049 --> 00:18:54.059 align:start position:0%
you know really as I mentioned just here
 
00:18:58.909 --> 00:18:58.919 align:start position:0%
to be a a resource to all of you and to
 
00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:02.700 align:start position:0%
the families that we serve and we want
 
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
to be able to you know help our
 
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
community understand
 
00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
whatever we can to assist them in
 
00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:13.380 align:start position:0%
educating them in relation to the child
 
00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
support program as that also extends an
 
00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:20.700 align:start position:0%
offer to all of you so understanding
 
00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
that our time is limited that is just a
 
00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:26.940 align:start position:0%
basic overview and a general overview of
 
00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:29.960 align:start position:0%
the child Support Program certainly
 
00:19:33.289 --> 00:19:33.299 align:start position:0%
attorney Hayes and I are available to
 
00:19:35.029 --> 00:19:35.039 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that the committee
 
00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:40.020 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:41.390 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
questions

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:19:43.789 --> 00:19:43.799 align:start position:0%
representative McMahon thank you Mr
 
00:19:43.799 --> 00:19:45.409 align:start position:0%
representative McMahon thank you Mr
chairman

00:19:45.409 --> 00:19:45.419 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh if I just clarification on appreciate
 
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
the data you provided when it says 71
 
00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
percent from the parents check one of
 
00:19:55.789 --> 00:19:55.799 align:start position:0%
the parents is that first a court order
 
00:19:58.850 --> 00:19:58.860 align:start position:0%
before garnishment can be implied or
 
00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:02.390 align:start position:0%
before garnishment can be implied or
done

00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:07.020 align:start position:0%
that is so the 71 percent uh collections
 
00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
of income wage garnishment
 
00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:11.210 align:start position:0%
of income wage garnishment
um

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:11.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:15.660 align:start position:0%
um is in relation to our total number of
 
00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:17.460 align:start position:0%
collections through the federal fiscal
 
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
year of 2021 any any orders that we were
 
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
collecting on and or enforcing on work
 
00:20:27.169 --> 00:20:27.179 align:start position:0%
collected by an income withholding order
 
00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:31.380 align:start position:0%
which is uh part of our child support
 
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
orders here in New Hampshire
 
00:20:36.529 --> 00:20:36.539 align:start position:0%
and and follow-up two things that is
 
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
just your guidance both of you on the
 
00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
the timeline once there's an application
 
00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
to the court and how long does it take
 
00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:45.660 align:start position:0%
to facilitate it when you have a need
 
00:20:48.409 --> 00:20:48.419 align:start position:0%
like tomorrow you know for the for the
 
00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
the family but also is um
 
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
when it's 29 from other sources
 
00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
what are the other sources to make up
 
00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:04.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for your questions
 
00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
um and if I understand what your
 
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
questions are so the um the first
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
question is the timeline from when our
 
00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:16.380 align:start position:0%
program receives an order for child
 
00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
support services to enforce from an
 
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
income uh and try to implement an income
 
00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
withholding order if one is available
 
00:21:27.289 --> 00:21:27.299 align:start position:0%
again I think it depends upon the timing
 
00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:29.460 align:start position:0%
we try to
 
00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
um we try to
 
00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
uh in by way of practice enter orders as
 
00:21:38.029 --> 00:21:38.039 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible onto the system it
 
00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:40.620 align:start position:0%
could be up to a couple of weeks before
 
00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:43.380 align:start position:0%
our staff can process those orders and
 
00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
get them up once we're able to issue an
 
00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
income with folding order it's up to the
 
00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:51.780 align:start position:0%
employer to be able to process that
 
00:21:54.409 --> 00:21:54.419 align:start position:0%
income withholding order what we try to
 
00:21:57.169 --> 00:21:57.179 align:start position:0%
tell our families is to be patient with
 
00:21:58.789 --> 00:21:58.799 align:start position:0%
their employer and that it could
 
00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:01.260 align:start position:0%
potentially take up to four weeks before
 
00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
they could get that income withholding
 
00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:05.820 align:start position:0%
order set up on their payroll if they
 
00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
have or if they're working with a
 
00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:09.900 align:start position:0%
payroll provider but we certainly
 
00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
encourage our paying parents to reach
 
00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:14.340 align:start position:0%
out to their employer to inform them
 
00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:16.820 align:start position:0%
that income withholding order may be
 
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
forthcoming and then our program will
 
00:22:22.909 --> 00:22:22.919 align:start position:0%
follow up within a 30-day time frame to
 
00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:25.740 align:start position:0%
see if you know if payments haven't been
 
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
received so we'll try to monitor to make
 
00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:31.380 align:start position:0%
sure that payments are received Timely
 
00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:34.140 align:start position:0%
and to answer your second question in
 
00:22:37.789 --> 00:22:37.799 align:start position:0%
relation to what the other sources of so
 
00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
that might be sources from unemployment
 
00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:44.900 align:start position:0%
that may be sources from self uh payors
 
00:22:48.529 --> 00:22:48.539 align:start position:0%
it may be sources of employment from any
 
00:22:51.169 --> 00:22:51.179 align:start position:0%
liens or
 
00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:55.260 align:start position:0%
um or Lottery intercepts it may also
 
00:22:57.950 --> 00:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
include payments from our federal offset
 
00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.510 align:start position:0%
include payments from our federal offset
program

00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:01.740 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:03.900 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
 
00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:05.390 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative

um
 
00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:12.900 align:start position:0%
chocolate study is possible Human
 
00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:14.700 align:start position:0%
Services required to do a child support
 
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
study every four years
 
00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
um can you get us
 
00:23:21.649 --> 00:23:21.659 align:start position:0%
the last one or do you know when the
 
00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:23.580 align:start position:0%
last one was
 
00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:26.340 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bickford Yes
 
00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:29.940 align:start position:0%
actually our program just completed a
 
00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
review of the child support guidelines
 
00:23:36.169 --> 00:23:36.179 align:start position:0%
in just of this past month that is
 
00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
published and is currently out on our
 
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
website but I would be happy to
 
00:23:45.169 --> 00:23:45.179 align:start position:0%
provide a copy of that to the committee
 
00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
um Not only would I like to see that I
 
00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
would like to see the last time the
 
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
legislator led a study committee was
 
00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:54.350 align:start position:0%
legislator led a study committee was
done

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:56.280 align:start position:0%
we used to do it legislatively and then
 
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
we allowed Human Service to do it on
 
00:24:00.529 --> 00:24:00.539 align:start position:0%
their own if the legislative
 
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
one didn't get done
 
00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:04.010 align:start position:0%
one didn't get done
um

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:06.360 align:start position:0%
and then just one other follow-up on
 
00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.390 align:start position:0%
and then just one other follow-up on
page

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
give you a chance to write
 
00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
um on your
 
00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:16.500 align:start position:0%
Pages uh with the
 
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
after page eight so I guess with page
 
00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.430 align:start position:0%
after page eight so I guess with page
nine

00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
nine
 
00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
this shows
 
00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:23.400 align:start position:0%
near the bottom there that New Hampshire
 
00:24:24.649 --> 00:24:24.659 align:start position:0%
spends a dollar
 
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
for every 3.15 collected and yet you go
 
00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
to the next page it shows nationally
 
00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:32.340 align:start position:0%
one dollar spent and they collect five
 
00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
dollars twenty seven cents so it's like
 
00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:37.020 align:start position:0%
wow that's kind of a wise disparity why
 
00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:38.340 align:start position:0%
does it cost so much in New Hampshire to
 
00:24:42.529 --> 00:24:42.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your questions
 
00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
um so the cost of um the
 
00:24:56.149 --> 00:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
for every dollar that is spent on the
 
00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
child support program the child support
 
00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
program here in New Hampshire based on
 
00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:02.220 align:start position:0%
our cost Effectiveness ratio collects
 
00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:04.380 align:start position:0%
three dollars and fifteen cents
 
00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
and then nationally for federal fiscal
 
00:25:09.529 --> 00:25:09.539 align:start position:0%
year as you correctly noted was for
 
00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:10.980 align:start position:0%
every dollar spent on the national
 
00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:12.409 align:start position:0%
every dollar spent on the national
program

00:25:12.409 --> 00:25:12.419 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:14.220 align:start position:0%
um throughout
 
00:25:16.669 --> 00:25:16.679 align:start position:0%
um that's five dollars and 27 cents
 
00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:18.900 align:start position:0%
which is certainly
 
00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:19.789 align:start position:0%
which is certainly
um

00:25:19.789 --> 00:25:19.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:22.669 --> 00:25:22.679 align:start position:0%
a there is a Formula behind the cost
 
00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:25.020 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness ratio here in New
 
00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:25.750 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness ratio here in New
Hampshire

00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:25:27.909 --> 00:25:27.919 align:start position:0%
that I could
 
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
certainly provide more information to
 
00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:32.340 align:start position:0%
you on if that's something that the
 
00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
committee would like
 
00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
to do it just looks like we're not doing
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
that well compared to the rest of the
 
00:25:40.789 --> 00:25:40.799 align:start position:0%
nation so I'll leave you with that and
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
if you can give me any information I I'd
 
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you thank you
 
00:25:48.649 --> 00:25:48.659 align:start position:0%
any further questions uh representative
 
00:25:48.659 --> 00:25:49.970 align:start position:0%
any further questions uh representative
Raymond

00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:49.980 align:start position:0%
Raymond
 
00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chairman and thank you so
 
00:25:54.049 --> 00:25:54.059 align:start position:0%
much for coming this morning I'm curious
 
00:25:54.059 --> 00:25:56.029 align:start position:0%
much for coming this morning I'm curious
about

00:25:56.029 --> 00:25:56.039 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:25:59.390 --> 00:25:59.400 align:start position:0%
um timing of the collecting of child
 
00:26:02.029 --> 00:26:02.039 align:start position:0%
support child support payments and the
 
00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
distribution of those payments to the
 
00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
other parent so
 
00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:07.860 align:start position:0%
um we've been talking in this committee
 
00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:09.529 align:start position:0%
um we've been talking in this committee
about

00:26:09.529 --> 00:26:09.539 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
um the potential of having a date like
 
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
on the first or the 15th of the month
 
00:26:16.669 --> 00:26:16.679 align:start position:0%
that child support payments would be
 
00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:19.380 align:start position:0%
collected and then dispersed how does
 
00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:22.020 align:start position:0%
that work now is there like does
 
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
everyone getting child support payments
 
00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:26.100 align:start position:0%
get them on the first of the month or is
 
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
it dependent upon the employer the
 
00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:32.820 align:start position:0%
whoever is employed when they get paid
 
00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:34.980 align:start position:0%
or is there some other mechanism by
 
00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:38.460 align:start position:0%
which the payments are dispersed on a
 
00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
you know regular basis as soon as the
 
00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
payment is received thank you for your
 
00:26:45.169 --> 00:26:45.179 align:start position:0%
question as soon as the payment is
 
00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:46.980 align:start position:0%
received we disperse those payments out
 
00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
to the other um to the parent receiving
 
00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:50.700 align:start position:0%
it within 48 hours
 
00:26:53.029 --> 00:26:53.039 align:start position:0%
okay so it all depends on when the
 
00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
payments are received by the program
 
00:26:57.409 --> 00:26:57.419 align:start position:0%
okay thank you yes
 
00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
further questions I have I have a couple
 
00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
um you you mentioned uh child support in
 
00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:05.450 align:start position:0%
um you you mentioned uh child support in
medical

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:05.460 align:start position:0%
medical
 
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
okay so my first question is your um
 
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
you receive payments
 
00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
from those that are just garnished I
 
00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:16.860 align:start position:0%
know there are some parents that are
 
00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:20.820 align:start position:0%
paying directly to their spouses to pay
 
00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
is your payments are just by garnish or
 
00:27:27.529 --> 00:27:27.539 align:start position:0%
do some parents send a check into you
 
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
other than an employee
 
00:27:31.909 --> 00:27:31.919 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
um yes we received payments from so we
 
00:27:38.269 --> 00:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
receive and collect payments from
 
00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
individuals who apply for our services
 
00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
in the first instance not all families
 
00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:47.220 align:start position:0%
apply for our services so the ones that
 
00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
the families that do we collect and
 
00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:52.260 align:start position:0%
receive payments in all sorts of of
 
00:27:54.169 --> 00:27:54.179 align:start position:0%
manners either through income
 
00:27:57.470 --> 00:27:57.480 align:start position:0%
withholding they can pay by check they
 
00:27:59.710 --> 00:27:59.720 align:start position:0%
can pay through money order through
 
00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
MoneyGram we through our contracted
 
00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:07.620 align:start position:0%
State Disbursement Unit we have a an
 
00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:10.740 align:start position:0%
option for electronic fund transfers so
 
00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:12.500 align:start position:0%
that they can do direct
 
00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:14.580 align:start position:0%
payments through their banking
 
00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:17.220 align:start position:0%
institution there are multiple ways that
 
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
families can pay for their support not
 
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
just by an income withholding order
 
00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
although that is the preferred and uh
 
00:28:32.029 --> 00:28:32.039 align:start position:0%
ordered way if it is available great and
 
00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:34.500 align:start position:0%
uh my other question is with respect to
 
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
Medical is it just
 
00:28:39.649 --> 00:28:39.659 align:start position:0%
those that are in your system
 
00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's those that are both child
 
00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
support and you also
 
00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:47.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:50.700 align:start position:0%
yeah so so it's not if I if I'm not
 
00:28:53.149 --> 00:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
required to pay child support but as a
 
00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:55.380 align:start position:0%
medical would you be involved in that
 
00:28:57.529 --> 00:28:57.539 align:start position:0%
medical or is it just because of the
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
child support
 
00:29:00.529 --> 00:29:00.539 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
representative Wong and if I could just
 
00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:04.919 align:start position:0%
clarify so in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:07.140 align:start position:0%
we have our uniform support order
 
00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:09.720 align:start position:0%
process requires that both a child
 
00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
support a financial obligation if it's
 
00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:14.820 align:start position:0%
applicable and a medical support
 
00:29:18.049 --> 00:29:18.059 align:start position:0%
provision of parents responsibility to
 
00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:20.100 align:start position:0%
provide Health Care coverage to their
 
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
dependent if the agency if the bureau is
 
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
collecting and enforcing on that child
 
00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:29.100 align:start position:0%
support order because a family has
 
00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:32.100 align:start position:0%
applied for our services we will look to
 
00:29:34.909 --> 00:29:34.919 align:start position:0%
enforce both child support and Health
 
00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
Care coverage provisions
 
00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:38.340 align:start position:0%
Health Care coverage in New Hampshire
 
00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
can be provided in a multiple of ways it
 
00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:44.460 align:start position:0%
can be through satisfied through public
 
00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:46.500 align:start position:0%
health insurance through for example
 
00:29:48.409 --> 00:29:48.419 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and or through Private health
 
00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:52.200 align:start position:0%
insurance so if we have a obligated
 
00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
parent who is required to provide health
 
00:29:57.649 --> 00:29:57.659 align:start position:0%
insurance to their dependent and let's
 
00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:01.020 align:start position:0%
say perhaps their employer provides
 
00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
health insurance as a option for
 
00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:07.980 align:start position:0%
employment and that health insurance is
 
00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:12.140 align:start position:0%
covered under the amount that the
 
00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
person responsible to pay is a
 
00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
reasonable cost here in New Hampshire
 
00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:19.620 align:start position:0%
then we will work to the employer to get
 
00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:22.020 align:start position:0%
that dependent rolled enrolled in that
 
00:30:24.169 --> 00:30:24.179 align:start position:0%
Health Care coverage so we try to ensure
 
00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:26.580 align:start position:0%
that both the child support and the
 
00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
health care coverage are covered great
 
00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
hi thanks for coming sorry I missed your
 
00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:40.860 align:start position:0%
presentation I was in another meeting
 
00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:43.140 align:start position:0%
um I have a question somebody recently
 
00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:44.700 align:start position:0%
asked me
 
00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:46.980 align:start position:0%
when you have a situation does child
 
00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:50.340 align:start position:0%
support always end at 18 and the
 
00:30:52.909 --> 00:30:52.919 align:start position:0%
situation that someone came to me when
 
00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:55.740 align:start position:0%
you have a child that become you gained
 
00:30:58.090 --> 00:30:58.100 align:start position:0%
guardianship of because of a disability
 
00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:02.940 align:start position:0%
after 18 where does that are there any
 
00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:04.980 align:start position:0%
child support
 
00:31:09.169 --> 00:31:09.179 align:start position:0%
like the medical after 18 if you have
 
00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
guardianship or if there's a adult child
 
00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
so like meaning you have lifelong care
 
00:31:21.289 --> 00:31:21.299 align:start position:0%
of that dependent
 
00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
there's a divorce does it end at 18 I
 
00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:26.149 align:start position:0%
there's a divorce does it end at 18 I
guess

00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
guess
 
00:31:28.789 --> 00:31:28.799 align:start position:0%
somebody just recently reached out about
 
00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:32.820 align:start position:0%
two dependents that that's the situation
 
00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:34.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for that
 
00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:35.630 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for that
question

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:35.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:38.220 align:start position:0%
um I I think that there's kind of two
 
00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:40.020 align:start position:0%
parts in your question there and I don't
 
00:31:42.289 --> 00:31:42.299 align:start position:0%
know that I would be um ultimately
 
00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
informed to be able to answer that
 
00:31:46.669 --> 00:31:46.679 align:start position:0%
question for you properly because what
 
00:31:49.130 --> 00:31:49.140 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing you ask about is
 
00:31:50.269 --> 00:31:50.279 align:start position:0%
um does
 
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
does uh child support end at 18 or the
 
00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
provision for health insurance coverage
 
00:31:58.850 --> 00:31:58.860 align:start position:0%
in a child support end at 18 and then
 
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
there's a second half of that which it
 
00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:02.700 align:start position:0%
sounds like continuing Health Care
 
00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
coverage after somebody turns 18. again
 
00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
the the piece that I could really speak
 
00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:13.740 align:start position:0%
to is that you know the uh the we
 
00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
enforce orders
 
00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
both health insurance and child support
 
00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:23.640 align:start position:0%
through high school graduation or age 18
 
00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:28.500 align:start position:0%
whichever comes last and uh unless the
 
00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
court order specifically States
 
00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:34.140 align:start position:0%
differently so I would not to be able to
 
00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
answer your second question I would need
 
00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
to reach out to some of my colleagues in
 
00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
the department to better answer that
 
00:32:43.789 --> 00:32:43.799 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:32:45.409 --> 00:32:45.419 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:47.820 align:start position:0%
see you none thank you very much thank
 
00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:54.350 align:start position:0%
see you none thank you very much thank
you

00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
so uh I believe the behavioral health is
 
00:32:58.250 --> 00:32:58.260 align:start position:0%
Miss Ross
 
00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:37.850 align:start position:0%
Miss Ross
awesome

00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:37.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:39.769 --> 00:33:39.779 align:start position:0%
sorry about that good morning
 
00:33:42.169 --> 00:33:42.179 align:start position:0%
um for the record I'm Rebecca Ross the
 
00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:43.620 align:start position:0%
director of The Bureau for children's
 
00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health which is within the
 
00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:49.380 align:start position:0%
division of Behavioral Health that
 
00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services
 
00:33:56.269 --> 00:33:56.279 align:start position:0%
um I see a bunch of familiar faces and a
 
00:33:58.789 --> 00:33:58.799 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of new ones so I have tried
 
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
to put together a presentation that
 
00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:04.740 align:start position:0%
gives some background current state and
 
00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:08.700 align:start position:0%
next steps I will try my best not to use
 
00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:12.540 align:start position:0%
um acronyms or nicknames in a way that I
 
00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:14.820 align:start position:0%
lose people quickly I do get excited
 
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
about what we do and talking about it so
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
please stop me if um if I slip one in
 
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
and you'd like an explanation I have
 
00:34:25.669 --> 00:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
tried to leave them out of them you get
 
00:34:28.329 --> 00:34:28.339 align:start position:0%
a gimme on DHHS
 
00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
oh boy I could be here a long time
 
00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:35.580 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative Pearson but
 
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
please do stop me
 
00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
um because we have been moving fast over
 
00:34:42.829 --> 00:34:42.839 align:start position:0%
the last few years
 
00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:44.580 align:start position:0%
um does everyone have the presentations
 
00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
now okay great
 
00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:49.070 align:start position:0%
now okay great
so

00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:51.780 align:start position:0%
um I believe I have a half an hour I
 
00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
will try to do my best to to stay on
 
00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:56.149 align:start position:0%
will try to do my best to to stay on
that

00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:34:56.159 --> 00:34:58.490 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:34:58.490 --> 00:34:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:02.290 --> 00:35:02.300 align:start position:0%
the first slide after the cover page
 
00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:03.829 align:start position:0%
the first slide after the cover page
is

00:35:03.829 --> 00:35:03.839 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:06.420 align:start position:0%
um just a representation of our org
 
00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:10.260 align:start position:0%
chart showing that our division is under
 
00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:12.420 align:start position:0%
the same associate commissioner as the
 
00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:14.900 align:start position:0%
division for children youth and families
 
00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:18.540 align:start position:0%
and until very recently we really didn't
 
00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:20.390 align:start position:0%
and until very recently we really didn't
have

00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:21.170 align:start position:0%
have
um

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:21.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:23.220 align:start position:0%
a distinct Bureau for children's
 
00:35:26.569 --> 00:35:26.579 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health there was a lack of
 
00:35:28.609 --> 00:35:28.619 align:start position:0%
access across the board and particularly
 
00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
for high intensity voluntary Services
 
00:35:35.569 --> 00:35:35.579 align:start position:0%
which could only be accessed in dcyf
 
00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
cases through a court order
 
00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:39.290 align:start position:0%
cases through a court order
so

00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:39.300 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
um when we were created we were put
 
00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:42.780 align:start position:0%
within the division of Behavioral Health
 
00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
Services but under the same leadership
 
00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:48.660 align:start position:0%
as dcyf so we continue to work closely
 
00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:51.540 align:start position:0%
with dcyf to serve their population as
 
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
well as individuals that are not court
 
00:35:57.109 --> 00:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
involved that need access to treatment
 
00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:00.900 align:start position:0%
going on to the second slide I work in
 
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
the Bureau for children's Behavioral
 
00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:06.200 align:start position:0%
Health we're broken up into three units
 
00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:09.420 align:start position:0%
our system of care which many of you
 
00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:12.180 align:start position:0%
have seen and heard about over the last
 
00:36:16.069 --> 00:36:16.079 align:start position:0%
few years is made up of five tiers
 
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
our Bureau is broken up into three
 
00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
bureaus and one two and five are within
 
00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:25.140 align:start position:0%
the system of care administration we
 
00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
also have intensive
 
00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:30.540 align:start position:0%
community-based services and the third
 
00:36:32.569 --> 00:36:32.579 align:start position:0%
Bureau is the residential treatment
 
00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
services and so
 
00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:37.980 align:start position:0%
um we'll explain what those tiers are
 
00:36:39.829 --> 00:36:39.839 align:start position:0%
and what's included in them in the next
 
00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:42.060 align:start position:0%
few slides but that's how we've
 
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
organized the work that we have and we
 
00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
have a total of nine people
 
00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:48.200 align:start position:0%
supporting the work throughout the state
 
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
and really
 
00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:54.440 align:start position:0%
driving the work that started in 2016
 
00:36:56.589 --> 00:36:56.599 align:start position:0%
with the first
 
00:36:59.329 --> 00:36:59.339 align:start position:0%
statutory reference to a children's
 
00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:02.820 align:start position:0%
system of care the community and state
 
00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:04.740 align:start position:0%
work started a little bit before that
 
00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:07.500 align:start position:0%
but in the 2016 session
 
00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
the first version of RSA 135 F was
 
00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:13.740 align:start position:0%
adopted which is the children's system
 
00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
of care law it charges both the
 
00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and the
 
00:37:19.930 --> 00:37:19.940 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:22.980 align:start position:0%
with creating an integrated system of
 
00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:23.890 align:start position:0%
with creating an integrated system of
care

00:37:23.890 --> 00:37:23.900 align:start position:0%
care
 
00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:27.060 align:start position:0%
and you'll see that it's developed
 
00:37:28.609 --> 00:37:28.619 align:start position:0%
they've developed a comprehensive plan
 
00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
for improving Effectiveness efficiency
 
00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
and integration of children's Behavioral
 
00:37:36.589 --> 00:37:36.599 align:start position:0%
Health Services and we take that mandate
 
00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
extremely seriously that in everything
 
00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:41.220 align:start position:0%
we build we're trying to eliminate those
 
00:37:43.069 --> 00:37:43.079 align:start position:0%
silos figure out how people are going to
 
00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
access them how people are going to know
 
00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:46.380 align:start position:0%
about them and how they are going to
 
00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:49.140 align:start position:0%
work together to serve the children
 
00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:51.900 align:start position:0%
youth with their families
 
00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:54.660 align:start position:0%
in 2019
 
00:37:58.970 --> 00:37:58.980 align:start position:0%
um the Senate bill 14 was adopted and it
 
00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:03.060 align:start position:0%
not only amended RSA 135f but RSA 170g
 
00:38:05.089 --> 00:38:05.099 align:start position:0%
which is Children's Services which
 
00:38:09.130 --> 00:38:09.140 align:start position:0%
historically was only dcyf services
 
00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
this law change expanded it to really be
 
00:38:16.810 --> 00:38:16.820 align:start position:0%
encompassing of all children accessing
 
00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health Services so we
 
00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
continue to certify those providers
 
00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
under that statute but they're not
 
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
exclusively for dcyf involved families
 
00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:31.020 align:start position:0%
um Additionally the public assistance
 
00:38:33.349 --> 00:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
statute was amended to include the
 
00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:35.220 align:start position:0%
mandates to create a benefit for our
 
00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
High Fidelity wrap around through a
 
00:38:41.589 --> 00:38:41.599 align:start position:0%
Medicaid State Plan Amendment and create
 
00:38:46.089 --> 00:38:46.099 align:start position:0%
mobile crisis Statewide for children
 
00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:49.640 align:start position:0%
and we have Incorporated that into
 
00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
Statewide rapid response and we'll talk
 
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
a little bit more about that but that
 
00:38:55.849 --> 00:38:55.859 align:start position:0%
was one of the major drivers when we
 
00:38:58.010 --> 00:38:58.020 align:start position:0%
built the rapid response system
 
00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
the statutory framework includes the
 
00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
values for the system which are that
 
00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:06.180 align:start position:0%
services our family and youth driven
 
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
Community Based culturally and
 
00:39:11.089 --> 00:39:11.099 align:start position:0%
linguistically competent and
 
00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed was added in 2019. and
 
00:39:17.089 --> 00:39:17.099 align:start position:0%
we incorporate that into everything we
 
00:39:20.450 --> 00:39:20.460 align:start position:0%
do it's incorporated as a requirement in
 
00:39:22.569 --> 00:39:22.579 align:start position:0%
all of the contracts with providers
 
00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:25.380 align:start position:0%
consultants and other individuals that
 
00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:28.140 align:start position:0%
we work with to ensure that we have that
 
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
consistency and integration across every
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
tier and every type of service that is
 
00:39:37.609 --> 00:39:37.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
um so what does a system of care include
 
00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
going back to 135 F it's not just
 
00:39:46.370 --> 00:39:46.380 align:start position:0%
children's Behavioral Health it's not
 
00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:48.300 align:start position:0%
just dcyf involved youth but it's
 
00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:50.460 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities the special
 
00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
education statute
 
00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:56.220 align:start position:0%
um Services under 135c which is the
 
00:39:58.270 --> 00:39:58.280 align:start position:0%
traditional mental health statute
 
00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:01.380 align:start position:0%
early intervention including our child
 
00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:03.560 align:start position:0%
development Bureau for example
 
00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:06.660 align:start position:0%
and the child care scholarship program
 
00:40:09.650 --> 00:40:09.660 align:start position:0%
in early supports and services so
 
00:40:12.349 --> 00:40:12.359 align:start position:0%
essentially anywhere starting from that
 
00:40:14.810 --> 00:40:14.820 align:start position:0%
very early assessment and contact with
 
00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:17.640 align:start position:0%
families the services that we are
 
00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
supporting for families
 
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
should be consistent with those system
 
00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
of care values and built and improved in
 
00:40:28.849 --> 00:40:28.859 align:start position:0%
an integrated way
 
00:40:32.589 --> 00:40:32.599 align:start position:0%
the framework requires us to have a
 
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
uniform or Universal assessment in those
 
00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
contracts we've selected the cans so
 
00:40:42.410 --> 00:40:42.420 align:start position:0%
that is the child in adolescent needs
 
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
and strengths tool historically it was
 
00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:46.140 align:start position:0%
done at the community mental health
 
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
centers which are a tier 2 service
 
00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:52.380 align:start position:0%
and we have included it in our
 
00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:54.900 align:start position:0%
residential programming our contract
 
00:40:57.250 --> 00:40:57.260 align:start position:0%
with the operators of Hampstead Hospital
 
00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:00.180 align:start position:0%
the dcyf child protection protection
 
00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:02.700 align:start position:0%
workers and juvenile probation and
 
00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:05.940 align:start position:0%
parole officers have been trained so now
 
00:41:07.730 --> 00:41:07.740 align:start position:0%
we have information on strengths and
 
00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
needs of children throughout the system
 
00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:12.900 align:start position:0%
that we can look at how they are
 
00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
improving or not as well as how
 
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
providers are performing over time it's
 
00:41:20.569 --> 00:41:20.579 align:start position:0%
going to be a lot of work to refine
 
00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
those Data Systems to make sure that
 
00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:25.140 align:start position:0%
we're best using that information which
 
00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:27.780 align:start position:0%
is a goal of ours but for the first time
 
00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:29.820 align:start position:0%
we can really start to look at
 
00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
measurable data on on how we're doing
 
00:41:34.069 --> 00:41:34.079 align:start position:0%
and how healthy our children and
 
00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:35.940 align:start position:0%
families are
 
00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:39.900 align:start position:0%
so I will use cat cans going forward
 
00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
um but uh I've defined it and I think
 
00:41:46.069 --> 00:41:46.079 align:start position:0%
that it'll make sense in the future
 
00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:48.540 align:start position:0%
context but that's becoming a very
 
00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:50.050 align:start position:0%
context but that's becoming a very
Universal

00:41:50.050 --> 00:41:50.060 align:start position:0%
Universal
 
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
term for our system including as
 
00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:54.900 align:start position:0%
individuals are looking for what level
 
00:41:57.710 --> 00:41:57.720 align:start position:0%
of care asking what did the cat what did
 
00:41:59.750 --> 00:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
the cans identify what are their
 
00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:01.500 align:start position:0%
strengths what are their needs how can
 
00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:02.870 align:start position:0%
strengths what are their needs how can
we

00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:05.640 align:start position:0%
um you know lean on their strengths and
 
00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:07.740 align:start position:0%
what do we do need to do to meet their
 
00:42:09.349 --> 00:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
needs and all of our providers are
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
starting to talk in that same language
 
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
there are some additional drivers of the
 
00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:17.220 align:start position:0%
system of care work that we're doing
 
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
Beyond just the
 
00:42:22.609 --> 00:42:22.619 align:start position:0%
system of care laws in New Hampshire we
 
00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:25.140 align:start position:0%
also have the 10-year mental health plan
 
00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
which in 2019 it was the first plan that
 
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
included Children and Youth
 
00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:32.940 align:start position:0%
um the Juvenile Justice transformation
 
00:42:35.089 --> 00:42:35.099 align:start position:0%
work that requires an assessment which
 
00:42:37.310 --> 00:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
is a modified version of the cans prior
 
00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:40.380 align:start position:0%
to law enforcement or prosecutors filing
 
00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
a petition for delinquency in court to
 
00:42:45.109 --> 00:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not community
 
00:42:48.290 --> 00:42:48.300 align:start position:0%
supports are more appropriate and
 
00:42:49.730 --> 00:42:49.740 align:start position:0%
available and connect youth before
 
00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:51.900 align:start position:0%
they're ever court involved because we
 
00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:53.640 align:start position:0%
know that once they are court involved
 
00:42:58.430 --> 00:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
it is much harder to step back from that
 
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
court system and if we can get them
 
00:43:02.050 --> 00:43:02.060 align:start position:0%
before that
 
00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
we have a much better success of Never
 
00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:06.300 align:start position:0%
Getting to court or staying court
 
00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
um I have
 
00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
included a little bit more of an
 
00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
explanation of those as well as the
 
00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:18.060 align:start position:0%
family first Prevention Services act
 
00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
which is the federal act that was
 
00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:22.260 align:start position:0%
adopted in 2018 that really changed the
 
00:43:26.410 --> 00:43:26.420 align:start position:0%
way title IV foster care funds follow
 
00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
the services supporting prevention for
 
00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
the first time and putting some guard
 
00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:34.020 align:start position:0%
rails on the use of residential
 
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
placements to require them to be
 
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
treatment could I ask you to call out
 
00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:40.140 align:start position:0%
either the slide number which is in four
 
00:43:42.829 --> 00:43:42.839 align:start position:0%
point type or better the page number in
 
00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
the lower right hand corner because I I
 
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
fear we're on different pages okay yes I
 
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
am on the bottom of page five and when I
 
00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:52.380 align:start position:0%
realized that my presentation was so
 
00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:54.780 align:start position:0%
long I chose not to do full-size slides
 
00:43:57.710 --> 00:43:57.720 align:start position:0%
I am happy to email them because you can
 
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
see it a lot better if particularly the
 
00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:03.420 align:start position:0%
data and not just the slide numbers so I
 
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
will I will stick with page numbers to
 
00:44:07.370 --> 00:44:07.380 align:start position:0%
to help guide us
 
00:44:09.170 --> 00:44:09.180 align:start position:0%
um so we've also come up with a new
 
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
graphic to really show the big picture
 
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
so so at the top of page six and you
 
00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
cannot read all the tiny little things
 
00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:18.060 align:start position:0%
in the blue boxes but we will be
 
00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:19.740 align:start position:0%
explaining and walking through those and
 
00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
I'll get to the electronic version but
 
00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:24.060 align:start position:0%
essentially we've created a graphic that
 
00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
is a circle with child and family in the
 
00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:27.109 align:start position:0%
is a circle with child and family in the
center

00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
center
 
00:44:27.119 --> 00:44:28.910 align:start position:0%
center
and

00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:44:31.450 --> 00:44:31.460 align:start position:0%
um the five tiers wrapped around
 
00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
with rapid response on the outside of
 
00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:37.260 align:start position:0%
all of that because it can support any
 
00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:41.640 align:start position:0%
level of care these are not rigid tears
 
00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:43.740 align:start position:0%
people will move in and out of systems
 
00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:46.740 align:start position:0%
some providers will primarily fit in one
 
00:44:50.569 --> 00:44:50.579 align:start position:0%
bucket but maybe surveying kids in in
 
00:44:55.490 --> 00:44:55.500 align:start position:0%
multiple tiers it's more of a framework
 
00:44:58.309 --> 00:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
and a concept of how we start and move
 
00:45:00.530 --> 00:45:00.540 align:start position:0%
through the system supporting children
 
00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:03.780 align:start position:0%
and families so starting at the lowest
 
00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
level including
 
00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:08.460 align:start position:0%
every child and youth with assessment
 
00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
screening and treatment moving on to
 
00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:13.500 align:start position:0%
community-based Services which would
 
00:45:16.609 --> 00:45:16.619 align:start position:0%
include outpatient counseling Community
 
00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:19.020 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Centers to the Intensive
 
00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:22.500 align:start position:0%
Care Management Services tier four our
 
00:45:26.569 --> 00:45:26.579 align:start position:0%
residential system and tier V are acute
 
00:45:30.109 --> 00:45:30.119 align:start position:0%
system so originally when we looked at
 
00:45:33.290 --> 00:45:33.300 align:start position:0%
this it was the acute psychiatric care
 
00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
hospitalization but we recognize that we
 
00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
need to ensure that the emergency
 
00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:40.500 align:start position:0%
departments as well as rapid response
 
00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
are really included in one one tier
 
00:45:47.930 --> 00:45:47.940 align:start position:0%
and so because rapid response can serve
 
00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:51.060 align:start position:0%
at any any stage or any phase of a
 
00:45:54.290 --> 00:45:54.300 align:start position:0%
crisis including up to tier five we've
 
00:45:56.510 --> 00:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
included it in tier five for discussion
 
00:45:58.250 --> 00:45:58.260 align:start position:0%
and we know that the emergency
 
00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:00.660 align:start position:0%
departments in our hospitals are doing a
 
00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:02.700 align:start position:0%
lot of work to stabilize and support
 
00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:05.460 align:start position:0%
children and family as they move between
 
00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
the necessary services
 
00:46:10.130 --> 00:46:10.140 align:start position:0%
so moving on to the bottom of page six
 
00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:12.780 align:start position:0%
tier one that assessment screening and
 
00:46:15.370 --> 00:46:15.380 align:start position:0%
treatment is intended to be the services
 
00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
accessed by all children all children
 
00:46:21.410 --> 00:46:21.420 align:start position:0%
are going to school or child care or
 
00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
their pediatrician are we doing those
 
00:46:28.069 --> 00:46:28.079 align:start position:0%
screenings and assessments and sending
 
00:46:30.349 --> 00:46:30.359 align:start position:0%
them and referring to the appropriate
 
00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:35.690 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:46:35.690 --> 00:46:35.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:38.329 --> 00:46:38.339 align:start position:0%
tier two looking at those
 
00:46:40.250 --> 00:46:40.260 align:start position:0%
community-based services including our
 
00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
federally qualified Health Centers some
 
00:46:45.069 --> 00:46:45.079 align:start position:0%
dcyf specific services
 
00:46:47.870 --> 00:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
but primarily Our Community Mental
 
00:46:49.849 --> 00:46:49.859 align:start position:0%
Health Centers which prior to the system
 
00:46:53.089 --> 00:46:53.099 align:start position:0%
of care were really the only place
 
00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:55.020 align:start position:0%
besides private counseling or
 
00:46:56.990 --> 00:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
hospitalization for children and
 
00:46:58.970 --> 00:46:58.980 align:start position:0%
families to go if they were not involved
 
00:47:00.829 --> 00:47:00.839 align:start position:0%
with dcyf
 
00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
the bottom of page seven shows some of
 
00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:05.829 align:start position:0%
the bottom of page seven shows some of
the

00:47:05.829 --> 00:47:05.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
increase or overall growth in the
 
00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:11.220 align:start position:0%
community mental health centers so the
 
00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
bottom red line is that trend line over
 
00:47:17.690 --> 00:47:17.700 align:start position:0%
the last few years
 
00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:19.980 align:start position:0%
um for Youth and you can see that both
 
00:47:22.849 --> 00:47:22.859 align:start position:0%
Youth and adults have seen a substantial
 
00:47:25.309 --> 00:47:25.319 align:start position:0%
increase and we know that there are
 
00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:28.260 align:start position:0%
still capacity issues in community-based
 
00:47:31.730 --> 00:47:31.740 align:start position:0%
services but we also know that capacity
 
00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:33.839 align:start position:0%
has been growing and it doesn't feel
 
00:47:35.569 --> 00:47:35.579 align:start position:0%
like that for the children and families
 
00:47:37.970 --> 00:47:37.980 align:start position:0%
who are on a waitlist who were who still
 
00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:40.740 align:start position:0%
have needs and who can't get them met
 
00:47:43.609 --> 00:47:43.619 align:start position:0%
immediately but we do also have the data
 
00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:45.839 align:start position:0%
that supports that we are expanding
 
00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
access for that population as well as
 
00:47:50.809 --> 00:47:50.819 align:start position:0%
the adult population is just not keeping
 
00:47:53.329 --> 00:47:53.339 align:start position:0%
up with the needs that have grown over
 
00:47:56.109 --> 00:47:56.119 align:start position:0%
the last few years
 
00:47:59.030 --> 00:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
the Intensive community-based Services
 
00:48:04.010 --> 00:48:04.020 align:start position:0%
also driven from RSA 135f started out
 
00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:06.900 align:start position:0%
with what was known as and still is
 
00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:09.240 align:start position:0%
known as fast forward it's New
 
00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:12.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's High Fidelity wrap around it
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
is an evidence-based practice
 
00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
um and we have expanded greatly over the
 
00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
last few years when we provide that
 
00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
service as a Medicaid benefit through a
 
00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:27.420 align:start position:0%
state plan Amendment we have to renew
 
00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:30.680 align:start position:0%
that every five years the first time we
 
00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
submitted it five years ago our
 
00:48:34.010 --> 00:48:34.020 align:start position:0%
projection was that we would be
 
00:48:36.890 --> 00:48:36.900 align:start position:0%
surveying approximately 150 families a
 
00:48:38.890 --> 00:48:38.900 align:start position:0%
year we are well over
 
00:48:42.829 --> 00:48:42.839 align:start position:0%
500 at this point combined with with our
 
00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
truck services that we'll talk about but
 
00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
well over 400 at any point in time which
 
00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
was not anticipated and is a huge impact
 
00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
on Staffing for the agencies that are
 
00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:55.380 align:start position:0%
providing those services our peer
 
00:48:57.109 --> 00:48:57.119 align:start position:0%
support agent agencies that are part of
 
00:48:58.450 --> 00:48:58.460 align:start position:0%
that model
 
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
and essentially everyone else that's
 
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
connected to it serving those families
 
00:49:06.290 --> 00:49:06.300 align:start position:0%
is a is a high intensity service with a
 
00:49:07.329 --> 00:49:07.339 align:start position:0%
lot of contact
 
00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
that takes takes a lot of the workforce
 
00:49:13.130 --> 00:49:13.140 align:start position:0%
and we're very excited about the number
 
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
of families being served that means
 
00:49:17.089 --> 00:49:17.099 align:start position:0%
they're not moving into residential or
 
00:49:19.730 --> 00:49:19.740 align:start position:0%
sitting in our emergency departments or
 
00:49:23.150 --> 00:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
being hospitalized but it does mean that
 
00:49:24.770 --> 00:49:24.780 align:start position:0%
we need more and more Workforce every
 
00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:25.609 align:start position:0%
we need more and more Workforce every
day

00:49:25.609 --> 00:49:25.619 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:29.960 align:start position:0%
so in addition to fast forward
 
00:49:33.349 --> 00:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
we have added Trek was which is
 
00:49:35.089 --> 00:49:35.099 align:start position:0%
Transitional residential enhanced care
 
00:49:37.010 --> 00:49:37.020 align:start position:0%
coordination built on the same model
 
00:49:39.650 --> 00:49:39.660 align:start position:0%
serving individuals in residential care
 
00:49:43.130 --> 00:49:43.140 align:start position:0%
or psychiatric care including at sysc to
 
00:49:44.809 --> 00:49:44.819 align:start position:0%
transition them safely back into the
 
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
community and then most recently we have
 
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
added the Early Childhood component
 
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
which is the zero to five population
 
00:49:56.329 --> 00:49:56.339 align:start position:0%
and based on exposure to Aces as well as
 
00:49:58.670 --> 00:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
a child's diagnosis so really supporting
 
00:50:01.970 --> 00:50:01.980 align:start position:0%
the caregiver and looking at
 
00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
um the environment the child is has been
 
00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
exposed to to meet their needs before we
 
00:50:10.370 --> 00:50:10.380 align:start position:0%
see them later on in their childhood and
 
00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
Adolescence the Care Management entities
 
00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:15.650 align:start position:0%
Adolescence the Care Management entities
are

00:50:15.650 --> 00:50:15.660 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:18.050 align:start position:0%
are
specifically

00:50:18.050 --> 00:50:18.060 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:50:20.809 --> 00:50:20.819 align:start position:0%
um we have two contracted entities in
 
00:50:23.809 --> 00:50:23.819 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire they are conflict-free so
 
00:50:26.510 --> 00:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
they are intended to be able to assess
 
00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:28.260 align:start position:0%
and identify those needs and connect
 
00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
families with those services without
 
00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
referring to themselves and they are
 
00:50:37.550 --> 00:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
looking at the goals of using the Care
 
00:50:39.890 --> 00:50:39.900 align:start position:0%
Management entities are to improve the
 
00:50:42.589 --> 00:50:42.599 align:start position:0%
clinical outcomes enhance efficiencies
 
00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:46.280 align:start position:0%
and control costs and Foster resiliency
 
00:50:50.290 --> 00:50:50.300 align:start position:0%
in the families and youth that we serve
 
00:50:53.569 --> 00:50:53.579 align:start position:0%
and on the first five years and our
 
00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
pilot the data has been very supportive
 
00:50:59.630 --> 00:50:59.640 align:start position:0%
of those fast forward services and we're
 
00:51:01.010 --> 00:51:01.020 align:start position:0%
starting to look at that data as we're
 
00:51:03.170 --> 00:51:03.180 align:start position:0%
building into Trek and the zero to five
 
00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:04.270 align:start position:0%
building into Trek and the zero to five
models

00:51:04.270 --> 00:51:04.280 align:start position:0%
models
 
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
the components include the page number
 
00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:10.740 align:start position:0%
please thank you
 
00:51:13.490 --> 00:51:13.500 align:start position:0%
um page nine the top slide
 
00:51:15.890 --> 00:51:15.900 align:start position:0%
so for all of the services there's some
 
00:51:17.569 --> 00:51:17.579 align:start position:0%
form of enhanced care coordination
 
00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
family and youth peer support obviously
 
00:51:23.569 --> 00:51:23.579 align:start position:0%
the zero to five model is modified that
 
00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:25.140 align:start position:0%
you know they're not receiving youth
 
00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
peer support and the peer support is
 
00:51:28.870 --> 00:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
focused on the caregiver
 
00:51:31.309 --> 00:51:31.319 align:start position:0%
customizable goods and services and the
 
00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:32.700 align:start position:0%
Care Management entities have
 
00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:34.740 align:start position:0%
responsibilities through their contracts
 
00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:37.980 align:start position:0%
to also help
 
00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
develop that provider Network through
 
00:51:43.790 --> 00:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
training through identifying the best
 
00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
practices and collecting data on the
 
00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
services used and the outcomes so they
 
00:51:52.970 --> 00:51:52.980 align:start position:0%
really are Partners in continuing to
 
00:51:54.490 --> 00:51:54.500 align:start position:0%
measure the system
 
00:51:58.670 --> 00:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
and expanding the services because the
 
00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:00.420 align:start position:0%
the Care Management entity and the care
 
00:52:03.010 --> 00:52:03.020 align:start position:0%
coordination isn't the clinical service
 
00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
and they're still engaging and
 
00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:08.220 align:start position:0%
connecting them with those Clinical
 
00:52:11.390 --> 00:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
Services so it's
 
00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
essentially the navigation for the
 
00:52:16.370 --> 00:52:16.380 align:start position:0%
family that has a number of different
 
00:52:18.049 --> 00:52:18.059 align:start position:0%
needs that will be met through different
 
00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:20.280 align:start position:0%
Community providers
 
00:52:23.089 --> 00:52:23.099 align:start position:0%
the bottom of page nine shows the
 
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
history of the system of care
 
00:52:26.770 --> 00:52:26.780 align:start position:0%
development starting with that original
 
00:52:31.970 --> 00:52:31.980 align:start position:0%
pilot and Grant in 2012 and the most
 
00:52:36.170 --> 00:52:36.180 align:start position:0%
recent Law changes in 2021 we have not
 
00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:38.460 align:start position:0%
added the 2022 I think we're going to
 
00:52:40.750 --> 00:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
have to move to two slides eventually
 
00:52:44.030 --> 00:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
but this really does show how much has
 
00:52:46.130 --> 00:52:46.140 align:start position:0%
changed and how many major Milestones
 
00:52:50.329 --> 00:52:50.339 align:start position:0%
we've hit in just about 10 years
 
00:52:53.329 --> 00:52:53.339 align:start position:0%
moving on to the top of page 10 is that
 
00:52:55.790 --> 00:52:55.800 align:start position:0%
fast forward data and through our two
 
00:52:57.950 --> 00:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
Care Management entities you can see
 
00:52:57.960 --> 00:52:59.270 align:start position:0%
Care Management entities you can see
that

00:52:59.270 --> 00:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:53:02.450 --> 00:53:02.460 align:start position:0%
um it was really 20 fall of 2020 that
 
00:53:04.309 --> 00:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
our second Care Management entity came
 
00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:05.880 align:start position:0%
on board
 
00:53:07.790 --> 00:53:07.800 align:start position:0%
um where those purple lines start at the
 
00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:08.710 align:start position:0%
um where those purple lines start at the
bottom

00:53:08.710 --> 00:53:08.720 align:start position:0%
bottom
 
00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
and between the two 130 and 360 we are
 
00:53:18.410 --> 00:53:18.420 align:start position:0%
very close to that 500 number just with
 
00:53:21.410 --> 00:53:21.420 align:start position:0%
those fast forward families
 
00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:21.950 align:start position:0%
those fast forward families
um

00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
the transitional residential enhanced
 
00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
care coordination
 
00:53:29.930 --> 00:53:29.940 align:start position:0%
um on the bottom of page 10 is the same
 
00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:34.020 align:start position:0%
model for youth that are within a
 
00:53:37.549 --> 00:53:37.559 align:start position:0%
program or facility and that started in
 
00:53:41.690 --> 00:53:41.700 align:start position:0%
July of 2021 and we at the end of
 
00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
December of 22 we're serving 140
 
00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
families the goal is to serve All
 
00:53:51.109 --> 00:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
Families or all youth that are in
 
00:53:51.119 --> 00:53:52.690 align:start position:0%
Families or all youth that are in
placement

00:53:52.690 --> 00:53:52.700 align:start position:0%
placement
 
00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
as we build up Workforce we will
 
00:53:58.010 --> 00:53:58.020 align:start position:0%
continue to see that number grow until
 
00:53:59.870 --> 00:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
we start to see the number of Children
 
00:54:03.910 --> 00:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
and Youth in residential going down
 
00:54:08.089 --> 00:54:08.099 align:start position:0%
but right now to prioritize we are
 
00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
serving children and families who are
 
00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:14.220 align:start position:0%
um not in the dcif system that don't
 
00:54:16.069 --> 00:54:16.079 align:start position:0%
otherwise have a caseworker assigned
 
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
that can help do that coordination so
 
00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:21.720 align:start position:0%
the majority of these children and youth
 
00:54:23.870 --> 00:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
are not dcyf involved with the exception
 
00:54:28.250 --> 00:54:28.260 align:start position:0%
of the identified complex cases and the
 
00:54:30.349 --> 00:54:30.359 align:start position:0%
youth at the sununity Services Center
 
00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
who were prioritized to receive that
 
00:54:36.890 --> 00:54:36.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:40.430 --> 00:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
um and then the Early Childhood just
 
00:54:43.609 --> 00:54:43.619 align:start position:0%
rolled out this summer we received money
 
00:54:46.609 --> 00:54:46.619 align:start position:0%
about a year ago and
 
00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
going to the the bottom of page 12
 
00:54:51.890 --> 00:54:51.900 align:start position:0%
um at the end of the year we were
 
00:54:55.250 --> 00:54:55.260 align:start position:0%
serving about 18 families and we know
 
00:54:58.790 --> 00:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
that that is is going up and as we have
 
00:55:01.130 --> 00:55:01.140 align:start position:0%
more coordinators trained for that
 
00:55:04.190 --> 00:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
specific population that we've completed
 
00:55:07.609 --> 00:55:07.619 align:start position:0%
or created specific training on top of
 
00:55:09.109 --> 00:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire wraparound model
 
00:55:11.930 --> 00:55:11.940 align:start position:0%
training we will onboard more and more
 
00:55:14.030 --> 00:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
families for that population
 
00:55:16.849 --> 00:55:16.859 align:start position:0%
it is as I said earlier and it's on the
 
00:55:19.490 --> 00:55:19.500 align:start position:0%
slide on the top of page 12
 
00:55:22.010 --> 00:55:22.020 align:start position:0%
um eligibility can be based on exposure
 
00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
to Aces and the caregiver needs not
 
00:55:26.270 --> 00:55:26.280 align:start position:0%
exclusively the child's needs and that's
 
00:55:30.650 --> 00:55:30.660 align:start position:0%
getting wrapped into our Medicaid State
 
00:55:35.329 --> 00:55:35.339 align:start position:0%
plan to be effective next July 1.
 
00:55:37.549 --> 00:55:37.559 align:start position:0%
right now it's supported with other
 
00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
funds but we're continuing to grow and
 
00:55:42.290 --> 00:55:42.300 align:start position:0%
hopefully as as that grows that Medicaid
 
00:55:44.650 --> 00:55:44.660 align:start position:0%
benefit will come on board
 
00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
tier four is the residential treatment
 
00:55:49.069 --> 00:55:49.079 align:start position:0%
there's been major changes with
 
00:55:51.410 --> 00:55:51.420 align:start position:0%
Residential Treatment including moving
 
00:55:53.150 --> 00:55:53.160 align:start position:0%
to a Contracting model in the summer of
 
00:55:57.109 --> 00:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
2021 adding a whole host of deliberate
 
00:56:00.370 --> 00:56:00.380 align:start position:0%
deliverables including training data
 
00:56:02.569 --> 00:56:02.579 align:start position:0%
incorporating the system of care values
 
00:56:06.170 --> 00:56:06.180 align:start position:0%
where previously it was uh license and
 
00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:09.240 align:start position:0%
certification system where those met the
 
00:56:10.790 --> 00:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
minimum standards and that was the
 
00:56:12.829 --> 00:56:12.839 align:start position:0%
extent of our oversight with the
 
00:56:15.549 --> 00:56:15.559 align:start position:0%
exception of Investigations now we have
 
00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:18.180 align:start position:0%
required contract Provisions that we can
 
00:56:20.030 --> 00:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
monitor and oversee and require
 
00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
additional data including use of the
 
00:56:24.890 --> 00:56:24.900 align:start position:0%
cans so that we really can see how those
 
00:56:27.589 --> 00:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
providers are meeting the needs of
 
00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
Children and Youth additionally we have
 
00:56:33.950 --> 00:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
broken the providers up into levels of
 
00:56:36.109 --> 00:56:36.119 align:start position:0%
care one through five one being
 
00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
independent living five being
 
00:56:40.069 --> 00:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
psychiatric Residential Treatment
 
00:56:43.609 --> 00:56:43.619 align:start position:0%
Facility the most intense the closest to
 
00:56:46.730 --> 00:56:46.740 align:start position:0%
inpatient which is what we are standing
 
00:56:49.010 --> 00:56:49.020 align:start position:0%
up at Hampstead Hospital later this
 
00:56:52.490 --> 00:56:52.500 align:start position:0%
spring so previously
 
00:56:55.790 --> 00:56:55.800 align:start position:0%
there was no access for voluntary
 
00:56:58.430 --> 00:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
Residential Treatment you had to be
 
00:57:00.349 --> 00:57:00.359 align:start position:0%
court involved to access those providers
 
00:57:02.990 --> 00:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
we are now serving directly over 50
 
00:57:04.910 --> 00:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
youth through their families they're
 
00:57:06.829 --> 00:57:06.839 align:start position:0%
quite required to participate with the
 
00:57:09.170 --> 00:57:09.180 align:start position:0%
Care Management entity
 
00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
um in the development of the transition
 
00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
plan home because the goal is to be
 
00:57:17.809 --> 00:57:17.819 align:start position:0%
there for as little time as possible and
 
00:57:19.790 --> 00:57:19.800 align:start position:0%
successfully transition back into the
 
00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:21.530 align:start position:0%
successfully transition back into the
community

00:57:21.530 --> 00:57:21.540 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:57:24.109 --> 00:57:24.119 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to stop fairly soon
 
00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
but I would like to since Hampstead
 
00:57:28.250 --> 00:57:28.260 align:start position:0%
Hospital I live in Hampstead and she
 
00:57:29.890 --> 00:57:29.900 align:start position:0%
lives next door
 
00:57:33.230 --> 00:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
if you would address the question
 
00:57:35.210 --> 00:57:35.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you so
 
00:57:37.490 --> 00:57:37.500 align:start position:0%
much for taking my questions
 
00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:38.510 align:start position:0%
much for taking my questions
um

00:57:38.510 --> 00:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:43.690 --> 00:57:43.700 align:start position:0%
how many beds do you anticipate needing
 
00:57:47.829 --> 00:57:47.839 align:start position:0%
and are necessary at Hampstead Hospital
 
00:57:55.010 --> 00:57:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:57.109 --> 00:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question that's
 
00:57:59.750 --> 00:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
extremely complex
 
00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:00.290 align:start position:0%
extremely complex
um

00:58:00.290 --> 00:58:00.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:02.450 --> 00:58:02.460 align:start position:0%
and I don't have a quick answer for it
 
00:58:03.770 --> 00:58:03.780 align:start position:0%
what I can tell you is we're looking
 
00:58:06.349 --> 00:58:06.359 align:start position:0%
very carefully as the data is moving and
 
00:58:08.750 --> 00:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
doing a much better job tracking that
 
00:58:10.609 --> 00:58:10.619 align:start position:0%
data the psychiatric residential
 
00:58:13.609 --> 00:58:13.619 align:start position:0%
treatment facility that will be added to
 
00:58:18.170 --> 00:58:18.180 align:start position:0%
Hampstead will be 12 beds you are
 
00:58:22.730 --> 00:58:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:25.549 --> 00:58:25.559 align:start position:0%
I don't believe it has not been decided
 
00:58:27.530 --> 00:58:27.540 align:start position:0%
unless something happened yesterday that
 
00:58:29.690 --> 00:58:29.700 align:start position:0%
this will be cited in Hampstead I assume
 
00:58:32.089 --> 00:58:32.099 align:start position:0%
it will be but that has not been decided
 
00:58:33.589 --> 00:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
am I correct
 
00:58:36.049 --> 00:58:36.059 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to clarify what I'm referring
 
00:58:39.530 --> 00:58:39.540 align:start position:0%
to so currently there is
 
00:58:42.770 --> 00:58:42.780 align:start position:0%
um plans and development of a
 
00:58:44.450 --> 00:58:44.460 align:start position:0%
psychiatric residential treatment
 
00:58:48.289 --> 00:58:48.299 align:start position:0%
facility which under federal law is the
 
00:58:51.109 --> 00:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
psych under 21 benefit that is a
 
00:58:54.670 --> 00:58:54.680 align:start position:0%
clinical service that's not the same as
 
00:58:57.170 --> 00:58:57.180 align:start position:0%
the discussion regarding the sununu
 
00:58:59.150 --> 00:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
Youth Services Center thank you I
 
00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
apologize for that no problem so we've
 
00:59:03.049 --> 00:59:03.059 align:start position:0%
been working on the prtf for a couple
 
00:59:04.490 --> 00:59:04.500 align:start position:0%
years now
 
00:59:07.190 --> 00:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
um and as soon as construction is
 
00:59:12.410 --> 00:59:12.420 align:start position:0%
complete to bring the unit up to the the
 
00:59:13.970 --> 00:59:13.980 align:start position:0%
needs for a different type of facility
 
00:59:15.289 --> 00:59:15.299 align:start position:0%
that will be opening in the spring
 
00:59:17.390 --> 00:59:17.400 align:start position:0%
that's the existing building in
 
00:59:19.609 --> 00:59:19.619 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you it's just 12 beds
 
00:59:21.049 --> 00:59:21.059 align:start position:0%
within the existing facility but we
 
00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:22.260 align:start position:0%
don't have that level in New Hampshire
 
00:59:24.410 --> 00:59:24.420 align:start position:0%
now so any youth that needs that level
 
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
of care is required to go out of state
 
00:59:28.789 --> 00:59:28.799 align:start position:0%
so this is a huge step for us to start
 
00:59:31.490 --> 00:59:31.500 align:start position:0%
to have those first 12 bets we hope that
 
00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
those 12 beds will be all we need
 
00:59:34.370 --> 00:59:34.380 align:start position:0%
because we can have much better
 
00:59:34.380 --> 00:59:35.589 align:start position:0%
because we can have much better
engagement

00:59:35.589 --> 00:59:35.599 align:start position:0%
engagement
 
00:59:38.930 --> 00:59:38.940 align:start position:0%
and that we can have a shorter length so
 
00:59:40.789 --> 00:59:40.799 align:start position:0%
stay and ultimately that does meet our
 
00:59:44.030 --> 00:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
needs we we just don't know that yet we
 
00:59:46.450 --> 00:59:46.460 align:start position:0%
also know that there are specialty areas
 
00:59:50.569 --> 00:59:50.579 align:start position:0%
such as dual diagnosis individuals and
 
00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
others who who may still either need
 
00:59:54.349 --> 00:59:54.359 align:start position:0%
out-of-state care or we may need
 
00:59:57.589 --> 00:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
additional four or six bed specialty
 
01:00:00.170 --> 01:00:00.180 align:start position:0%
units but we're going to start with
 
01:00:03.950 --> 01:00:03.960 align:start position:0%
these 12 and and see where it goes
 
01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:08.220 align:start position:0%
um so moving on to the top of page 14
 
01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
our comprehensive assessment for
 
01:00:12.650 --> 01:00:12.660 align:start position:0%
treatment that's how we figure out what
 
01:00:14.569 --> 01:00:14.579 align:start position:0%
level of care and individual needs we
 
01:00:17.470 --> 01:00:17.480 align:start position:0%
take the cans information and add family
 
01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:19.030 align:start position:0%
take the cans information and add family
and

01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:00:21.650 --> 01:00:21.660 align:start position:0%
interviews of other individuals in a
 
01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:23.700 align:start position:0%
child's life including teachers and
 
01:00:27.410 --> 01:00:27.420 align:start position:0%
coaches and other primary caring adults
 
01:00:30.049 --> 01:00:30.059 align:start position:0%
as well as review of Prior documentation
 
01:00:32.510 --> 01:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
to establish whether or not they need
 
01:00:36.109 --> 01:00:36.119 align:start position:0%
Residential Care and what level if they
 
01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
do and then we match that up with the
 
01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
providers who we've changed to the
 
01:00:41.630 --> 01:00:41.640 align:start position:0%
Contracting model on the next couple
 
01:00:44.210 --> 01:00:44.220 align:start position:0%
slides you can see those levels spelled
 
01:00:47.089 --> 01:00:47.099 align:start position:0%
out as well as the first year where our
 
01:00:50.809 --> 01:00:50.819 align:start position:0%
assessor did 768 assessments from
 
01:00:53.809 --> 01:00:53.819 align:start position:0%
October of 21 through September of 22.
 
01:00:55.849 --> 01:00:55.859 align:start position:0%
also another area where for the first
 
01:00:59.329 --> 01:00:59.339 align:start position:0%
time we actually have clinical data that
 
01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
we can start to measure to assess system
 
01:01:04.849 --> 01:01:04.859 align:start position:0%
needs and how many beds we need at each
 
01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
level and shift our contracts and
 
01:01:10.609 --> 01:01:10.619 align:start position:0%
programming to to respond to what we're
 
01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:14.280 align:start position:0%
seeing we've never had this kind of data
 
01:01:16.250 --> 01:01:16.260 align:start position:0%
in our residential system before because
 
01:01:18.170 --> 01:01:18.180 align:start position:0%
we haven't had these Assessments in this
 
01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
kind of tracking
 
01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:20.990 align:start position:0%
kind of tracking
so

01:01:20.990 --> 01:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:24.900 align:start position:0%
um to wrap up we level five is that
 
01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:27.960 align:start position:0%
rapid response and hospital care we have
 
01:01:31.309 --> 01:01:31.319 align:start position:0%
on the bottom of page 16 in the first
 
01:01:34.670 --> 01:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
year of services had amazing
 
01:01:36.589 --> 01:01:36.599 align:start position:0%
um engagement with 25
 
01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:40.260 align:start position:0%
000 callers from people in crisis 6 000
 
01:01:42.049 --> 01:01:42.059 align:start position:0%
Community deployments including children
 
01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
and adults and the biggest difference we
 
01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:46.380 align:start position:0%
see between children and adults served
 
01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
in the system is the rate of deployment
 
01:01:50.809 --> 01:01:50.819 align:start position:0%
is much higher for children
 
01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:53.220 align:start position:0%
um and that's consistent with the
 
01:01:55.370 --> 01:01:55.380 align:start position:0%
national Trends Because by the time a
 
01:01:57.349 --> 01:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
caregiver calls they've exhausted all of
 
01:01:59.329 --> 01:01:59.339 align:start position:0%
the things that they are able to do in
 
01:02:00.770 --> 01:02:00.780 align:start position:0%
that Home and Community and they really
 
01:02:02.569 --> 01:02:02.579 align:start position:0%
are looking for someone to come out and
 
01:02:05.450 --> 01:02:05.460 align:start position:0%
the system is based on as perceived by
 
01:02:07.849 --> 01:02:07.859 align:start position:0%
the individuals and so if the caregiver
 
01:02:10.010 --> 01:02:10.020 align:start position:0%
calls and says I just need someone to
 
01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:12.420 align:start position:0%
come the system is intended to respond
 
01:02:15.170 --> 01:02:15.180 align:start position:0%
to that and go and that happens a lot
 
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
more on the children's services so we're
 
01:02:20.289 --> 01:02:20.299 align:start position:0%
doing a lot of work on system
 
01:02:22.730 --> 01:02:22.740 align:start position:0%
Improvement and measuring and looking at
 
01:02:24.770 --> 01:02:24.780 align:start position:0%
that data and partnering with our
 
01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:26.410 align:start position:0%
that data and partnering with our
universities

01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:26.420 align:start position:0%
universities
 
01:02:29.870 --> 01:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
to to use that data in meaningful ways
 
01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:31.490 align:start position:0%
to to use that data in meaningful ways
and

01:02:31.490 --> 01:02:31.500 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:33.829 --> 01:02:33.839 align:start position:0%
um going forward
 
01:02:36.410 --> 01:02:36.420 align:start position:0%
our biggest goal is to stay the course
 
01:02:38.329 --> 01:02:38.339 align:start position:0%
on the amazing system that's been
 
01:02:40.010 --> 01:02:40.020 align:start position:0%
designed and supported by the
 
01:02:42.010 --> 01:02:42.020 align:start position:0%
legislature and Community stakeholders
 
01:02:45.289 --> 01:02:45.299 align:start position:0%
ensure that we give it the time to grow
 
01:02:48.730 --> 01:02:48.740 align:start position:0%
and develop and work as intended
 
01:02:51.589 --> 01:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
knowing that when we started designing
 
01:02:53.690 --> 01:02:53.700 align:start position:0%
and building this we did not anticipate
 
01:02:57.049 --> 01:02:57.059 align:start position:0%
a pandemic and skyrocketing needs for
 
01:02:59.510 --> 01:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
both caregivers and Children and Youth
 
01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
but we do have the data to show that the
 
01:03:05.210 --> 01:03:05.220 align:start position:0%
system is responding access has
 
01:03:07.609 --> 01:03:07.619 align:start position:0%
increased and we still have a very long
 
01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
way to go and I'm happy to send these
 
01:03:12.049 --> 01:03:12.059 align:start position:0%
slides so they are bigger and you can
 
01:03:15.650 --> 01:03:15.660 align:start position:0%
read all of it and take any questions do
 
01:03:17.870 --> 01:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
you have a business card for each one of
 
01:03:20.089 --> 01:03:20.099 align:start position:0%
us or contact to your office the last
 
01:03:24.049 --> 01:03:24.059 align:start position:0%
page in this slide in set has
 
01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
um a number of different emails and
 
01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
contact information my email is the top
 
01:03:33.289 --> 01:03:33.299 align:start position:0%
one but we also have direct emails for
 
01:03:35.809 --> 01:03:35.819 align:start position:0%
inquiry to our Bureau in general which
 
01:03:37.549 --> 01:03:37.559 align:start position:0%
is checked by multiple people not just
 
01:03:40.010 --> 01:03:40.020 align:start position:0%
me so if it's a client question you
 
01:03:42.289 --> 01:03:42.299 align:start position:0%
might send a family to the one that
 
01:03:44.569 --> 01:03:44.579 align:start position:0%
three or four people check not just me
 
01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
it they'll get back to them faster fast
 
01:03:49.730 --> 01:03:49.740 align:start position:0%
forward cat referrals and then some
 
01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
websites for our partners for the cat
 
01:03:54.069 --> 01:03:54.079 align:start position:0%
assessment the Care Management entities
 
01:03:56.270 --> 01:03:56.280 align:start position:0%

written down I will save for another
 
01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:30.650 --> 01:04:30.660 align:start position:0%
we're about to go into an executive
 
01:04:34.910 --> 01:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
session and to review uh or maybe for
 
01:04:37.990 --> 01:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
the first time in an executive session
 
01:04:42.109 --> 01:04:42.119 align:start position:0%
uh we do not generally take testimony
 
01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
from the audience you've had your
 
01:04:47.809 --> 01:04:47.819 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do that both live and
 
01:04:52.190 --> 01:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
through emails sent to us the chair at
 
01:04:56.569 --> 01:04:56.579 align:start position:0%
his discretion has the opportunity if
 
01:04:59.569 --> 01:04:59.579 align:start position:0%
needed to ask the build sponsor for a
 
01:05:01.970 --> 01:05:01.980 align:start position:0%
clarification and it would be a
 
01:05:05.089 --> 01:05:05.099 align:start position:0%
clarification on a specific point only
 
01:05:09.890 --> 01:05:09.900 align:start position:0%
and not a re-hearing of the bill itself
 
01:05:13.970 --> 01:05:13.980 align:start position:0%
this is the opportunity where we as a
 
01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:16.130 align:start position:0%
this is the opportunity where we as a
committee

01:05:16.130 --> 01:05:16.140 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:05:19.970 --> 01:05:19.980 align:start position:0%
discuss it amongst ourselves and vote on
 
01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:21.829 align:start position:0%
discuss it amongst ourselves and vote on
it

01:05:21.829 --> 01:05:21.839 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
new rules with a very evenly divided
 
01:05:29.650 --> 01:05:29.660 align:start position:0%
house is that the leadership
 
01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:33.540 align:start position:0%
asks that the motion be made
 
01:05:35.930 --> 01:05:35.940 align:start position:0%
is a positive one in other words the
 
01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
motion is OTP I heard on that I forgot
 
01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:40.980 align:start position:0%
that last time and allowed an itl motion
 
01:05:43.490 --> 01:05:43.500 align:start position:0%
to be made first
 
01:05:46.970 --> 01:05:46.980 align:start position:0%
OTP ought to pass and then seconded and
 
01:05:49.130 --> 01:05:49.140 align:start position:0%
then we discuss it and that is the
 
01:05:51.890 --> 01:05:51.900 align:start position:0%
motion we vote on in order for an OTP
 
01:05:55.569 --> 01:05:55.579 align:start position:0%
motion to pass it has to have 50 percent
 
01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
plus one a tie vote is a defeated motion
 
01:06:05.030 --> 01:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
any questions on the process of
 
01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:06.410 align:start position:0%
any questions on the process of
this

01:06:06.410 --> 01:06:06.420 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:08.809 align:start position:0%

01:08:18.050 --> 01:08:18.060 align:start position:0%
capable of Contracting or balanced
 
01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:21.709 align:start position:0%
capable of Contracting or balanced
marriage

01:08:21.709 --> 01:08:21.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
there's some paperwork that just came my
 
01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:24.709 align:start position:0%

01:08:31.249 --> 01:08:31.259 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:34.309 --> 01:08:34.319 align:start position:0%
yeah this is the agenda Fitz coming to
 
01:08:40.610 --> 01:08:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:43.249 --> 01:08:43.259 align:start position:0%
please take a look at the bill as
 
01:08:45.829 --> 01:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
originally filed and the amendment just
 
01:08:50.169 --> 01:08:50.179 align:start position:0%
handed out you will see on the amendment
 
01:08:53.570 --> 01:08:53.580 align:start position:0%
0049h that there's a strikethrough and
 
01:08:56.570 --> 01:08:56.580 align:start position:0%
that is the change that is made we I
 
01:08:59.749 --> 01:08:59.759 align:start position:0%
recall there was a question raised about
 
01:09:04.030 --> 01:09:04.040 align:start position:0%
the null and void so the sponsor has
 
01:09:10.130 --> 01:09:10.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:17.689 --> 01:09:17.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:19.729 --> 01:09:19.739 align:start position:0%
representative Moulton
 
01:09:21.650 --> 01:09:21.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:09:25.189 --> 01:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
um I like the the strikethrough I I
 
01:09:27.910 --> 01:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
think that there could be potentially
 
01:09:30.650 --> 01:09:30.660 align:start position:0%
there is a there is a chance that there
 
01:09:33.349 --> 01:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
could be a a marriage that's that's
 
01:09:36.050 --> 01:09:36.060 align:start position:0%
already underway that that would be
 
01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
more complicated if we just made it null
 
01:09:41.090 --> 01:09:41.100 align:start position:0%
and void so I do I do approve of this
 
01:09:42.890 --> 01:09:42.900 align:start position:0%
amendment where we just keep those ones
 
01:09:46.209 --> 01:09:46.219 align:start position:0%
intact if there's any
 
01:09:49.370 --> 01:09:49.380 align:start position:0%
marriages that are already
 
01:09:53.209 --> 01:09:53.219 align:start position:0%
um you know consummated uh let them go
 
01:09:54.650 --> 01:09:54.660 align:start position:0%
through a normal process if they're
 
01:09:56.450 --> 01:09:56.460 align:start position:0%
going to dissolve those
 
01:09:58.729 --> 01:09:58.739 align:start position:0%
um but from here on out just not
 
01:10:04.250 --> 01:10:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:07.189 --> 01:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to say anything
 
01:10:09.709 --> 01:10:09.719 align:start position:0%
representative Greg
 
01:10:11.630 --> 01:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
sorry I have to ask a question first are
 
01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
we only discussing the amendment are we
 
01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
discussing ought to pass we are
 
01:10:17.090 --> 01:10:17.100 align:start position:0%
discussing and thinking the amendment
 
01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
01:10:26.030 --> 01:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:27.709 --> 01:10:27.719 align:start position:0%
I don't have anything on that I was just
 
01:10:29.209 --> 01:10:29.219 align:start position:0%
getting clarified okay fine thank you
 
01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:33.239 align:start position:0%
anyone else with anything to share
 
01:10:40.669 --> 01:10:40.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:42.350 --> 01:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
01:10:45.050 --> 01:10:45.060 align:start position:0%
yes representative Nelson thank you for
 
01:10:47.090 --> 01:10:47.100 align:start position:0%
taking my question I think people are a
 
01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:49.380 align:start position:0%
little confused as to are we just
 
01:10:51.649 --> 01:10:51.659 align:start position:0%
speaking about the strikethrough
 
01:10:54.470 --> 01:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
specifically or the entire Amendment at
 
01:10:56.390 --> 01:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
this time we are looking at the
 
01:10:58.970 --> 01:10:58.980 align:start position:0%
amendment as it exists before you the
 
01:11:01.370 --> 01:11:01.380 align:start position:0%
strikethrough says the amendment takes
 
01:11:06.010 --> 01:11:06.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:09.169 --> 01:11:09.179 align:start position:0%
we will discuss as amended then we will
 
01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
vote on the amendment and then we will
 
01:11:14.330 --> 01:11:14.340 align:start position:0%
vote if it passes the amendment we will
 
01:11:16.610 --> 01:11:16.620 align:start position:0%
vote on the bill as amended
 
01:11:19.370 --> 01:11:19.380 align:start position:0%
okay there's a
 
01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:26.930 --> 01:11:26.940 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:28.910 align:start position:0%
all right
um

01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:33.530 --> 01:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
I will be voting against the amendment
 
01:11:37.010 --> 01:11:37.020 align:start position:0%
because first of all between the ages of
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
16 and 18
 
01:11:42.430 --> 01:11:42.440 align:start position:0%
depending on who's doing the nose count
 
01:11:45.290 --> 01:11:45.300 align:start position:0%
this three to five marriages that have
 
01:11:47.689 --> 01:11:47.699 align:start position:0%
been done in the last few years that's
 
01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
it it's not that a whole bunch of
 
01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:52.070 align:start position:0%
it it's not that a whole bunch of
um

01:11:52.070 --> 01:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:55.010 --> 01:11:55.020 align:start position:0%
eager 16 year olds are running off to
 
01:11:57.229 --> 01:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
the town clerk to get married it is a
 
01:11:59.090 --> 01:11:59.100 align:start position:0%
very very small number
 
01:12:01.790 --> 01:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
secondly they are married only with
 
01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
permission of the Court
 
01:12:05.810 --> 01:12:05.820 align:start position:0%
and while I certainly do not believe in
 
01:12:09.470 --> 01:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
the infallibility of Judges I do believe
 
01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
that when two youngsters are presenting
 
01:12:16.010 --> 01:12:16.020 align:start position:0%
themselves before the court to ask
 
01:12:18.050 --> 01:12:18.060 align:start position:0%
permission to get married there's
 
01:12:22.130 --> 01:12:22.140 align:start position:0%
probably a very good reason for it
 
01:12:25.669 --> 01:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
also it has been stated in testimony
 
01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
that it is impossible for these
 
01:12:30.890 --> 01:12:30.900 align:start position:0%
marriages to be divorced because they
 
01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
are underage and cannot initiate this
 
01:12:36.290 --> 01:12:36.300 align:start position:0%
kind of a contract whereas the law as I
 
01:12:38.330 --> 01:12:38.340 align:start position:0%
read it the other day seems to indicate
 
01:12:42.110 --> 01:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
that such marriages can be dissolved
 
01:12:47.090 --> 01:12:47.100 align:start position:0%
um so for these reasons plus the fact
 
01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:49.070 align:start position:0%
um so for these reasons plus the fact
um

01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:52.490 --> 01:12:52.500 align:start position:0%
I think the state is wise when it
 
01:12:56.110 --> 01:12:56.120 align:start position:0%
interferes in the rights of individuals
 
01:12:59.149 --> 01:12:59.159 align:start position:0%
unless it is absolutely a clear and
 
01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
present need to do so I don't see the
 
01:13:04.970 --> 01:13:04.980 align:start position:0%
Clear and Present need here and would
 
01:13:08.750 --> 01:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
wish for the state to not be involved in
 
01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
this age 13 yeah I can make a case for
 
01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
that and I'm glad this was voted
 
01:13:17.390 --> 01:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
recently but 16 to 18 I do not see that
 
01:13:20.689 --> 01:13:20.699 align:start position:0%
so I'll be voting against it
 
01:13:24.590 --> 01:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
anyone else yes representative Moulton
 
01:13:27.169 --> 01:13:27.179 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um
 
01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the
 
01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.630 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the
context

01:13:32.630 --> 01:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
context
 
01:13:35.209 --> 01:13:35.219 align:start position:0%
vote down on a 13 year old getting
 
01:13:36.890 --> 01:13:36.900 align:start position:0%
married but we need to draw the line
 
01:13:39.649 --> 01:13:39.659 align:start position:0%
somewhere and right now
 
01:13:44.450 --> 01:13:44.460 align:start position:0%
um the line is at 16 and that is
 
01:13:47.149 --> 01:13:47.159 align:start position:0%
immature and so it needs to be raised
 
01:13:51.470 --> 01:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
and and this amendment would
 
01:13:53.330 --> 01:13:53.340 align:start position:0%
keep in tax
 
01:13:55.870 --> 01:13:55.880 align:start position:0%
the marriages that have already happened
 
01:13:58.970 --> 01:13:58.980 align:start position:0%
and would just prevent any harm going
 
01:14:01.490 --> 01:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
forward to minors to children that we
 
01:14:04.010 --> 01:14:04.020 align:start position:0%
need to protect as Representatives that
 
01:14:05.570 --> 01:14:05.580 align:start position:0%
are making the state law
 
01:14:08.030 --> 01:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
so I still feel that
 
01:14:12.709 --> 01:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
this spill is good as amended thank you
 
01:14:14.510 --> 01:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
01:14:18.410 --> 01:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:23.149 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

01:14:23.149 --> 01:14:23.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:26.570 --> 01:14:26.580 align:start position:0%
you referenced good reason Mr chairman
 
01:14:28.970 --> 01:14:28.980 align:start position:0%
am I allowed to
 
01:14:32.630 --> 01:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
the question wondering who defines what
 
01:14:35.870 --> 01:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
is good reason if two teenagers are
 
01:14:38.030 --> 01:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
going before the court
 
01:14:41.270 --> 01:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
um the court would do that and reference
 
01:14:43.729 --> 01:14:43.739 align:start position:0%
my previous statement about
 
01:14:45.890 --> 01:14:45.900 align:start position:0%
um I do not believe in the infallibility
 
01:14:48.050 --> 01:14:48.060 align:start position:0%
of the Court believe me but every once
 
01:14:49.850 --> 01:14:49.860 align:start position:0%
in a while somebody's got to decide and
 
01:14:53.930 --> 01:14:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:56.870 --> 01:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
um I also believe that between the ages
 
01:14:59.149 --> 01:14:59.159 align:start position:0%
of 16 and 18
 
01:15:01.010 --> 01:15:01.020 align:start position:0%
there should not be a marriage taking
 
01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:02.330 align:start position:0%
there should not be a marriage taking
place

01:15:02.330 --> 01:15:02.340 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:15:06.410 --> 01:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
um I'm a parent to three teenagers and
 
01:15:09.410 --> 01:15:09.420 align:start position:0%
I just I can't
 
01:15:11.930 --> 01:15:11.940 align:start position:0%
see how
 
01:15:13.550 --> 01:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
you can make that kind of a decision
 
01:15:16.010 --> 01:15:16.020 align:start position:0%
between the ages of 16 and 18 when your
 
01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
brain is not even fully developed
 
01:15:23.570 --> 01:15:23.580 align:start position:0%
so I support this amendment
 
01:15:25.729 --> 01:15:25.739 align:start position:0%
representative Greg
 
01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman as somebody who's
 
01:15:34.850 --> 01:15:34.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:37.130 --> 01:15:37.140 align:start position:0%
and also being a committee that is you
 
01:15:38.689 --> 01:15:38.699 align:start position:0%
know for the champion of children and
 
01:15:40.430 --> 01:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
family I think we have to look at the
 
01:15:42.229 --> 01:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
fact that we might only have five but
 
01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
we're also sending a clear message if
 
01:15:47.990 --> 01:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
you look at statistics 86 percent of
 
01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
those under age between 16 and 18
 
01:15:52.370 --> 01:15:52.380 align:start position:0%
getting married are girls young girls
 
01:15:54.709 --> 01:15:54.719 align:start position:0%
they're not women yet you also have to
 
01:15:57.709 --> 01:15:57.719 align:start position:0%
look at the fact that over 80 percent of
 
01:16:00.110 --> 01:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
those males that are marrying the
 
01:16:05.090 --> 01:16:05.100 align:start position:0%
females happen to be over 25 most likely
 
01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:07.260 align:start position:0%
30 and stuff so then we then we run into
 
01:16:09.890 --> 01:16:09.900 align:start position:0%
a situation where we have
 
01:16:12.290 --> 01:16:12.300 align:start position:0%
um you know a grooming type thing or
 
01:16:14.630 --> 01:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
abuse you also look at statistically
 
01:16:16.490 --> 01:16:16.500 align:start position:0%
what happens because I you know I
 
01:16:18.709 --> 01:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
listened to representative
 
01:16:20.570 --> 01:16:20.580 align:start position:0%
um Edwards about what he said in his
 
01:16:22.430 --> 01:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
descent he was the only descent in here
 
01:16:24.110 --> 01:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
he talked about
 
01:16:25.490 --> 01:16:25.500 align:start position:0%
um you know not wanting to give more
 
01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:28.260 align:start position:0%
options as far as abortion goes so I you
 
01:16:29.870 --> 01:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
know kind of delved into what are we
 
01:16:31.610 --> 01:16:31.620 align:start position:0%
looking at when a 16 year old what are
 
01:16:34.910 --> 01:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
the risks if they're pregnant versus
 
01:16:38.030 --> 01:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
um uh single or married what's
 
01:16:39.590 --> 01:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
interesting is the abortion rate really
 
01:16:41.590 --> 01:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't change but what does change
 
01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
dramatically is the fact of them not and
 
01:16:47.209 --> 01:16:47.219 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm focusing on women because we
 
01:16:50.330 --> 01:16:50.340 align:start position:0%
have 86 percent of the girls that are so
 
01:16:51.950 --> 01:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
what changes dramatically is whether or
 
01:16:54.169 --> 01:16:54.179 align:start position:0%
not they finish school once they're
 
01:16:57.110 --> 01:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
married so between 16 and 18 the chance
 
01:16:59.390 --> 01:16:59.400 align:start position:0%
of them not finishing school is over 50
 
01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:01.070 align:start position:0%
of them not finishing school is over 50
percent

01:17:01.070 --> 01:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:17:02.209 --> 01:17:02.219 align:start position:0%
um the chance of them being in a
 
01:17:04.910 --> 01:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
domestic violent relationship is high I
 
01:17:06.410 --> 01:17:06.420 align:start position:0%
have worked in this this has been my
 
01:17:08.810 --> 01:17:08.820 align:start position:0%
focus for years and also
 
01:17:11.090 --> 01:17:11.100 align:start position:0%
um they cannot so if they are in an
 
01:17:13.310 --> 01:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
abusive situation they actually cannot
 
01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
go to a shelter for domestic violence
 
01:17:18.169 --> 01:17:18.179 align:start position:0%
victims if they're under 18 without a
 
01:17:20.209 --> 01:17:20.219 align:start position:0%
parent so I think those are all things
 
01:17:22.250 --> 01:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
we need to really consider as far as
 
01:17:25.010 --> 01:17:25.020 align:start position:0%
what's appropriate for the law we don't
 
01:17:27.290 --> 01:17:27.300 align:start position:0%
even let somebody under 18 vote this is
 
01:17:28.430 --> 01:17:28.440 align:start position:0%
a big deal
 
01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
I question how you get 86 percent of
 
01:17:35.630 --> 01:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
them are girls when the total number
 
01:17:38.209 --> 01:17:38.219 align:start position:0%
is three to five sorry I'm talking about
 
01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
a national statistic and I you know what
 
01:17:42.410 --> 01:17:42.420 align:start position:0%
it is three to five but when you're
 
01:17:45.770 --> 01:17:45.780 align:start position:0%
working on a um a massive epidemic like
 
01:17:48.050 --> 01:17:48.060 align:start position:0%
domestic violence we're still and we're
 
01:17:49.850 --> 01:17:49.860 align:start position:0%
working with you know trafficking is is
 
01:17:52.130 --> 01:17:52.140 align:start position:0%
going up and up we have to look at the
 
01:17:53.689 --> 01:17:53.699 align:start position:0%
fact that yes it might be three to five
 
01:17:56.090 --> 01:17:56.100 align:start position:0%
but if your child was one of those three
 
01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
to five it would be a much bigger
 
01:18:00.830 --> 01:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
statistic my child
 
01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:02.510 align:start position:0%
statistic my child
um

01:18:02.510 --> 01:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:05.630 --> 01:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
would have to have the permission of the
 
01:18:07.189 --> 01:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
court for a reason
 
01:18:10.010 --> 01:18:10.020 align:start position:0%
I don't think domestic violence would be
 
01:18:12.169 --> 01:18:12.179 align:start position:0%
one of those reasons or I don't think
 
01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
trafficking would be so I'm wondering
 
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
how this enters I'm going to call on
 
01:18:18.830 --> 01:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
somebody else we may get back to others
 
01:18:21.709 --> 01:18:21.719 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson
 
01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:18:25.850 --> 01:18:25.860 align:start position:0%
um I have a couple of points here and
 
01:18:28.130 --> 01:18:28.140 align:start position:0%
one of the points is going back to what
 
01:18:28.140 --> 01:18:29.390 align:start position:0%
one of the points is going back to what
you

01:18:29.390 --> 01:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:18:30.610 --> 01:18:30.620 align:start position:0%
um alluded to
 
01:18:33.890 --> 01:18:33.900 align:start position:0%
regarding whether
 
01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:34.669 align:start position:0%
regarding whether
um

01:18:34.669 --> 01:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:38.689 --> 01:18:38.699 align:start position:0%
whether a married person who is a minor
 
01:18:41.390 --> 01:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
between the ages of 16 and 18 would be
 
01:18:45.110 --> 01:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
allowed to seek legal help hire an
 
01:18:47.870 --> 01:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
attorney go to a domestic violence
 
01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
shelter and in this section 21b3 it
 
01:18:55.550 --> 01:18:55.560 align:start position:0%
states that the certificate of marriage
 
01:18:58.570 --> 01:18:58.580 align:start position:0%
shall provide evidence of a Minor's
 
01:19:01.370 --> 01:19:01.380 align:start position:0%
emancipation and the definition of
 
01:19:01.380 --> 01:19:02.930 align:start position:0%
emancipation and the definition of
emancipation

01:19:02.930 --> 01:19:02.940 align:start position:0%
emancipation
 
01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:06.350 align:start position:0%
emancipation
is

01:19:06.350 --> 01:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:08.330 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:19:08.330 --> 01:19:08.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:14.390 --> 01:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
I had it right here the primary benefit
 
01:19:16.669 --> 01:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
of emancipation is legal autonomy
 
01:19:18.770 --> 01:19:18.780 align:start position:0%
regarding one's financial and personal
 
01:19:18.780 --> 01:19:20.090 align:start position:0%
regarding one's financial and personal
affairs

01:19:20.090 --> 01:19:20.100 align:start position:0%
affairs
 
01:19:23.450 --> 01:19:23.460 align:start position:0%
so I do believe that they would have
 
01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
access legally to sign into a contract
 
01:19:31.250 --> 01:19:31.260 align:start position:0%
with an attorney I did check with uh
 
01:19:34.430 --> 01:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
um domestic violence um
 
01:19:37.729 --> 01:19:37.739 align:start position:0%
program here in the state and I was told
 
01:19:40.970 --> 01:19:40.980 align:start position:0%
that no one regardless of age would be
 
01:19:42.590 --> 01:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
turned away
 
01:19:45.830 --> 01:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
so I disagree with with that
 
01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:48.110 align:start position:0%
so I disagree with with that
um

01:19:48.110 --> 01:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:49.490 --> 01:19:49.500 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if we're supposed I'm
 
01:19:50.810 --> 01:19:50.820 align:start position:0%
supposed to disagree but I'm just
 
01:19:53.750 --> 01:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
stating that I believe that what I was
 
01:19:57.169 --> 01:19:57.179 align:start position:0%
the answer that I was given to be true
 
01:19:59.450 --> 01:19:59.460 align:start position:0%
um and that's it thank you for your time
 
01:20:02.330 --> 01:20:02.340 align:start position:0%
thank you representative long
 
01:20:04.850 --> 01:20:04.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh yeah it's not
 
01:20:06.950 --> 01:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
complicated to me the fact that the
 
01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
legal system has to
 
01:20:13.070 --> 01:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
okay a marriage is the problem for me if
 
01:20:14.750 --> 01:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
I had a daughter and she came up to me
 
01:20:16.310 --> 01:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
and said uh
 
01:20:19.130 --> 01:20:19.140 align:start position:0%
or this the gentleman came up to me and
 
01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:20.209 align:start position:0%
or this the gentleman came up to me and
said

01:20:20.209 --> 01:20:20.219 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:20:22.430 --> 01:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
is it okay if I marry your daughter I
 
01:20:25.669 --> 01:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say let the courts decide that
 
01:20:28.130 --> 01:20:28.140 align:start position:0%
okay so the fact that you're not 18
 
01:20:30.050 --> 01:20:30.060 align:start position:0%
years old and you need to go to court to
 
01:20:32.630 --> 01:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
get permission to get married is
 
01:20:35.870 --> 01:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
problematic plain and simple thank you
 
01:20:38.810 --> 01:20:38.820 align:start position:0%
okay uh don't repeat what you've already
 
01:20:41.450 --> 01:20:41.460 align:start position:0%
said if you have new information say it
 
01:20:42.709 --> 01:20:42.719 align:start position:0%
and briefly please representative
 
01:20:45.950 --> 01:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
Moulton thank you Mr chairman to Circle
 
01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
back to the domestic violence portion of
 
01:20:48.239 --> 01:20:49.430 align:start position:0%
back to the domestic violence portion of
this

01:20:49.430 --> 01:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:20:52.970 --> 01:20:52.980 align:start position:0%
um I can tell you that domestic violence
 
01:20:55.070 --> 01:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
abusers they will wait until the
 
01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
relationship is secure in the form of a
 
01:21:01.010 --> 01:21:01.020 align:start position:0%
marriage before they first strike in
 
01:21:03.890 --> 01:21:03.900 align:start position:0%
multiple situations I can tell you that
 
01:21:06.590 --> 01:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
from my personal experience that they
 
01:21:09.890 --> 01:21:09.900 align:start position:0%
wait until they get married first and
 
01:21:12.050 --> 01:21:12.060 align:start position:0%
then they become violent they're not
 
01:21:14.149 --> 01:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
going to show their violent tendencies
 
01:21:17.510 --> 01:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
when the relationship is still frail and
 
01:21:19.910 --> 01:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
someone can break up easily
 
01:21:22.550 --> 01:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
because they want
 
01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a it's the mentality that
 
01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:33.229 --> 01:21:33.239 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative Bickford thank you
 
01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman well based on that that's
 
01:21:36.890 --> 01:21:36.900 align:start position:0%
why I just heard that's a great good
 
01:21:39.350 --> 01:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
reason not to get married
 
01:21:44.030 --> 01:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
ever going beyond that I two things um
 
01:21:48.169 --> 01:21:48.179 align:start position:0%
one uh we do allow people 16 year olds
 
01:21:50.270 --> 01:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
to go hunting and by themselves they can
 
01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
have a rifle if they take a National
 
01:21:55.610 --> 01:21:55.620 align:start position:0%
Rifle Association uh uh class uh we also
 
01:21:57.530 --> 01:21:57.540 align:start position:0%
let them buy automobiles so we do allow
 
01:22:01.250 --> 01:22:01.260 align:start position:0%
them to do uh dangerous things and uh
 
01:22:05.450 --> 01:22:05.460 align:start position:0%
but I I do not understand the
 
01:22:08.270 --> 01:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
strikethrough and how it why it's even
 
01:22:10.490 --> 01:22:10.500 align:start position:0%
in the original one and if anybody
 
01:22:12.649 --> 01:22:12.659 align:start position:0%
helped me with that that would
 
01:22:14.510 --> 01:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
help me representatives of Eck would you
 
01:22:15.950 --> 01:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
explain the strike through please in the
 
01:22:18.830 --> 01:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
amendment uh so the strikethrough is
 
01:22:20.810 --> 01:22:20.820 align:start position:0%
it's happened before I've had to amend
 
01:22:22.729 --> 01:22:22.739 align:start position:0%
it before when I put the spell through
 
01:22:25.310 --> 01:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
uh this would the strikethrough gets rid
 
01:22:27.169 --> 01:22:27.179 align:start position:0%
of all marriages contracted by such
 
01:22:30.770 --> 01:22:30.780 align:start position:0%
persons so being null and void uh what
 
01:22:33.169 --> 01:22:33.179 align:start position:0%
it would do is just making sure that
 
01:22:35.510 --> 01:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
those people that have gotten married
 
01:22:38.209 --> 01:22:38.219 align:start position:0%
before this is enacted their marriages
 
01:22:40.610 --> 01:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
are still intact but it's the
 
01:22:42.830 --> 01:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
this bill would just make sure that
 
01:22:45.229 --> 01:22:45.239 align:start position:0%
there is no further anybody under the
 
01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
age of 18 getting married this just
 
01:22:51.169 --> 01:22:51.179 align:start position:0%
prevents further marriages not ones that
 
01:22:53.689 --> 01:22:53.699 align:start position:0%
are the humorous irony is they would be
 
01:22:57.229 --> 01:22:57.239 align:start position:0%
grandfathered yes at such an age yeah
 
01:22:59.689 --> 01:22:59.699 align:start position:0%
looks the opposite to me okay
 
01:23:06.530 --> 01:23:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:08.689 --> 01:23:08.699 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question Shannon
 
01:23:08.699 --> 01:23:10.250 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question Shannon
Pearson

01:23:10.250 --> 01:23:10.260 align:start position:0%
Pearson
 
01:23:14.209 --> 01:23:14.219 align:start position:0%
usually if a child is getting married at
 
01:23:17.270 --> 01:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
16 and I'm not saying that they're not a
 
01:23:19.550 --> 01:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
little immature it's because the
 
01:23:22.189 --> 01:23:22.199 align:start position:0%
the girl is pregnant and if you're not
 
01:23:23.630 --> 01:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
going to allow
 
01:23:26.090 --> 01:23:26.100 align:start position:0%
this consummation of marriage you're
 
01:23:29.530 --> 01:23:29.540 align:start position:0%
forcing this situation
 
01:23:34.490 --> 01:23:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:37.390 --> 01:23:37.400 align:start position:0%
life and they don't believe in abortion
 
01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
uh you're kind of putting them in a
 
01:23:42.830 --> 01:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
situation to become more dependent on
 
01:23:44.510 --> 01:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:23:47.410 --> 01:23:47.420 align:start position:0%
rather than letting the couple support
 
01:23:50.450 --> 01:23:50.460 align:start position:0%
this welcoming gift
 
01:23:57.530 --> 01:23:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond
 
01:24:02.450 --> 01:24:02.460 align:start position:0%
um thank you thank you for um letting me
 
01:24:04.370 --> 01:24:04.380 align:start position:0%
speak so I have
 
01:24:06.590 --> 01:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
um three main points that I wanted to
 
01:24:07.490 --> 01:24:07.500 align:start position:0%
make here
 
01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
um the first is that um I approve of the
 
01:24:11.870 --> 01:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
amendment the strikethrough
 
01:24:13.910 --> 01:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
um I don't think that
 
01:24:15.830 --> 01:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
um we have any business dissolving
 
01:24:17.870 --> 01:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
marriages that have already occurred um
 
01:24:21.050 --> 01:24:21.060 align:start position:0%
just as a as a as a point in general I
 
01:24:22.310 --> 01:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
don't think that the state should be
 
01:24:24.110 --> 01:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
interfering with legal contracts that
 
01:24:25.790 --> 01:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
have already occurred
 
01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
um the the second thing I would say is
 
01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:29.990 align:start position:0%
um the the second thing I would say is
that

01:24:29.990 --> 01:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:24:32.330 --> 01:24:32.340 align:start position:0%
um regarding having a child out of
 
01:24:36.169 --> 01:24:36.179 align:start position:0%
wedlock it's 2023 more than half of
 
01:24:37.970 --> 01:24:37.980 align:start position:0%
children are born out of wedlock these
 
01:24:42.290 --> 01:24:42.300 align:start position:0%
days it's that's now normal and
 
01:24:45.530 --> 01:24:45.540 align:start position:0%
children under the age of 18 are not
 
01:24:47.149 --> 01:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
able to purchase their own health
 
01:24:49.790 --> 01:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
insurance on the marketplace even if
 
01:24:52.250 --> 01:24:52.260 align:start position:0%
they are emancipated which getting
 
01:24:55.250 --> 01:24:55.260 align:start position:0%
married does but in those cases you are
 
01:24:57.530 --> 01:24:57.540 align:start position:0%
not able to purchase your own health
 
01:25:00.590 --> 01:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
insurance on the marketplace we also
 
01:25:04.490 --> 01:25:04.500 align:start position:0%
have in-state law child labor laws that
 
01:25:08.990 --> 01:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
prevent children ages 16 and 17 from
 
01:25:10.850 --> 01:25:10.860 align:start position:0%
working full-time and thus being
 
01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
eligible for health benefits through
 
01:25:17.090 --> 01:25:17.100 align:start position:0%
their employer therefore the only option
 
01:25:20.570 --> 01:25:20.580 align:start position:0%
for a child who is pregnant under the
 
01:25:23.630 --> 01:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
age of 18 is to a beyond their parents
 
01:25:25.850 --> 01:25:25.860 align:start position:0%
insurance which they are legally
 
01:25:27.470 --> 01:25:27.480 align:start position:0%
required to provide until the child is
 
01:25:31.250 --> 01:25:31.260 align:start position:0%
26 or B Medicaid that's it those are the
 
01:25:33.169 --> 01:25:33.179 align:start position:0%
only options in the entire country of
 
01:25:36.110 --> 01:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
the United States so an argument that we
 
01:25:39.110 --> 01:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
should be allowing children to engage in
 
01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
illegal contract with another person who
 
01:25:44.689 --> 01:25:44.699 align:start position:0%
may or may not not also be a child
 
01:25:47.810 --> 01:25:47.820 align:start position:0%
for the sake of a pregnancy
 
01:25:50.270 --> 01:25:50.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't hold any legal weight here
 
01:25:54.229 --> 01:25:54.239 align:start position:0%
there's no benefit in my opinion one of
 
01:25:55.970 --> 01:25:55.980 align:start position:0%
the biggest
 
01:25:55.980 --> 01:25:56.570 align:start position:0%
the biggest
um

01:25:56.570 --> 01:25:56.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:58.970 --> 01:25:58.980 align:start position:0%
requirements and responsibilities of
 
01:26:02.649 --> 01:26:02.659 align:start position:0%
this committee is to look at every
 
01:26:05.450 --> 01:26:05.460 align:start position:0%
potential bill that comes across our
 
01:26:08.209 --> 01:26:08.219 align:start position:0%
desks and view it through the lens of
 
01:26:10.850 --> 01:26:10.860 align:start position:0%
what is in the best interest of the
 
01:26:14.030 --> 01:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
child in this situation and so when I
 
01:26:15.649 --> 01:26:15.659 align:start position:0%
look at this bill as I'm looking at
 
01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
other bills that we are talking about
 
01:26:20.570 --> 01:26:20.580 align:start position:0%
I'm asking myself what is in the best
 
01:26:22.850 --> 01:26:22.860 align:start position:0%
interest of the child in this
 
01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
circumstance be it a male or a female is
 
01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
it in their best interest to enter into
 
01:26:32.209 --> 01:26:32.219 align:start position:0%
a legally binding contract when they are
 
01:26:34.250 --> 01:26:34.260 align:start position:0%
not allowed to enter into any other
 
01:26:37.189 --> 01:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
legally binding contracts we have laws
 
01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
against child labor we're saying that
 
01:26:42.050 --> 01:26:42.060 align:start position:0%
they're not old enough or developed
 
01:26:43.970 --> 01:26:43.980 align:start position:0%
enough or responsible enough to work
 
01:26:47.570 --> 01:26:47.580 align:start position:0%
more than 30 hours a week therefore
 
01:26:51.530 --> 01:26:51.540 align:start position:0%
we should continue that logic as a
 
01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
society we have been moving towards the
 
01:26:57.530 --> 01:26:57.540 align:start position:0%
idea as we develop that people do not
 
01:27:00.709 --> 01:27:00.719 align:start position:0%
become adults until they have
 
01:27:05.209 --> 01:27:05.219 align:start position:0%
finished high school and or turned 18.
 
01:27:09.110 --> 01:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
that's consistent it's consistent in our
 
01:27:12.050 --> 01:27:12.060 align:start position:0%
child support laws it's consistent in
 
01:27:14.629 --> 01:27:14.639 align:start position:0%
our labor laws it's consistent in our
 
01:27:17.290 --> 01:27:17.300 align:start position:0%
education laws and I don't see why
 
01:27:20.810 --> 01:27:20.820 align:start position:0%
marriage as this random legal contract
 
01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
that is intended for combining the
 
01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
assets of two individuals would be an
 
01:27:28.970 --> 01:27:28.980 align:start position:0%
exception to this rule so thank you
 
01:27:32.870 --> 01:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
anyone who is not spoken the chair is
 
01:27:34.729 --> 01:27:34.739 align:start position:0%
going to call the question which means
 
01:27:37.189 --> 01:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
we vote on ending discussion I think
 
01:27:39.169 --> 01:27:39.179 align:start position:0%
we've heard everything I'd like to see a
 
01:27:42.770 --> 01:27:42.780 align:start position:0%
show of hands how many support the
 
01:27:44.930 --> 01:27:44.940 align:start position:0%
calling of the question I.E we now
 
01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:48.840 align:start position:0%

01:32:32.090 --> 01:32:32.100 align:start position:0%
want a positive motion but when it goes
 
01:32:34.490 --> 01:32:34.500 align:start position:0%
to calendar there's no igl like it used
 
01:32:35.810 --> 01:32:37.070 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:32:37.070 --> 01:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:39.050 --> 01:32:39.060 align:start position:0%
you should take a motion behind here
 
01:32:39.060 --> 01:32:41.870 align:start position:0%
you should take a motion behind here
something

01:32:41.870 --> 01:32:41.880 align:start position:0%

to be OTP in the calendar
 
01:32:48.010 --> 01:32:48.020 align:start position:0%

01:32:50.450 --> 01:32:50.460 align:start position:0%
it makes sense let's do it we may not
 
01:32:52.310 --> 01:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
need it but just to make sure let's do
 
01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:53.209 align:start position:0%

I all right I will accept your motion on
 
01:32:57.530 --> 01:32:57.540 align:start position:0%

and it's coming around
 
01:36:03.310 --> 01:36:03.320 align:start position:0%
it's coming it should be coming around

01:36:38.209 --> 01:36:38.219 align:start position:0%
have a different Amendment because we
 
01:36:41.570 --> 01:36:41.580 align:start position:0%
were unsure about
 
01:36:41.580 --> 01:36:42.649 align:start position:0%
were unsure about
um

01:36:42.649 --> 01:36:42.659 align:start position:0%

01:36:48.709 --> 01:36:48.719 align:start position:0%

Upham

01:37:00.830 --> 01:37:00.840 align:start position:0%

01:37:08.149 --> 01:37:08.159 align:start position:0%
there were a couple questions that came
 
01:37:11.090 --> 01:37:11.100 align:start position:0%
up last time and former representative
 
01:37:14.510 --> 01:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
Mel Moran who runs several therapy
 
01:37:17.689 --> 01:37:17.699 align:start position:0%
agencies answered
 
01:37:20.510 --> 01:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
um quite well the question of insurance
 
01:37:22.610 --> 01:37:22.620 align:start position:0%
because he said any child in New
 
01:37:25.250 --> 01:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who doesn't have insurance his
 
01:37:27.709 --> 01:37:27.719 align:start position:0%
their the companies will help them apply
 
01:37:29.570 --> 01:37:29.580 align:start position:0%
for insurance because they're eligible
 
01:37:32.570 --> 01:37:32.580 align:start position:0%
for insurance so I didn't feel that it
 
01:37:35.270 --> 01:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
was needed to put it in the amendment
 
01:37:37.970 --> 01:37:37.980 align:start position:0%
because it it already exists so the
 
01:37:40.129 --> 01:37:40.139 align:start position:0%
people who would be directly involved
 
01:37:42.530 --> 01:37:42.540 align:start position:0%
with the issue at hand say there is no
 
01:37:42.540 --> 01:37:43.729 align:start position:0%

01:38:28.679 --> 01:38:30.169 align:start position:0%
thank you for addressing the question
regarding

01:38:30.169 --> 01:38:30.179 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
01:38:32.689 --> 01:38:32.699 align:start position:0%
um the insurance comp uh coverage
 
01:38:34.910 --> 01:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to speak towards this
 
01:38:37.070 --> 01:38:37.080 align:start position:0%
um bill I think that
 
01:38:38.870 --> 01:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
um we had quite a bit of public
 
01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:40.430 align:start position:0%
um we had quite a bit of public
testimony

01:38:40.430 --> 01:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:38:42.169 --> 01:38:42.179 align:start position:0%
um and I've had constituents reach out
 
01:38:43.430 --> 01:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
to me
 
01:38:46.790 --> 01:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
um indicating that this bill would have
 
01:38:49.669 --> 01:38:49.679 align:start position:0%
made a difference to them during their
 
01:38:52.970 --> 01:38:52.980 align:start position:0%
custody proceedings and so for that
 
01:38:56.090 --> 01:38:56.100 align:start position:0%
reason I am convinced that passing this
 
01:38:58.610 --> 01:38:58.620 align:start position:0%
is the right thing to do
 
01:39:01.490 --> 01:39:01.500 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:02.810 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
I

01:39:02.810 --> 01:39:02.820 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:39:02.820 --> 01:39:04.490 align:start position:0%
I
I hear

01:39:04.490 --> 01:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
I hear
 
01:39:07.010 --> 01:39:07.020 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry right here oh representative
 
01:39:09.470 --> 01:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
Bickford I am
 
01:39:10.970 --> 01:39:10.980 align:start position:0%
as you may know
 
01:39:10.980 --> 01:39:12.310 align:start position:0%

um
 
01:39:15.649 --> 01:39:15.659 align:start position:0%
uh bewilderment over the clause or in
 
01:39:17.450 --> 01:39:17.460 align:start position:0%
the event that a finding of abuse has
 
01:39:19.129 --> 01:39:19.139 align:start position:0%
been made and why that would disqualify
 
01:39:21.350 --> 01:39:21.360 align:start position:0%
them from agreeing with
 
01:39:25.370 --> 01:39:25.380 align:start position:0%
their uh former partner
 
01:39:29.030 --> 01:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
may I call the prime sponsor back for a
 
01:39:31.310 --> 01:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
clarification because you know my
 
01:39:32.930 --> 01:39:32.940 align:start position:0%
liberal arts mind could read this three
 
01:39:34.790 --> 01:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
different ways and it's a blessing but
 
01:39:38.209 --> 01:39:38.219 align:start position:0%
it's often a curse so what does it mean
 
01:39:39.649 --> 01:39:39.659 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
01:39:39.659 --> 01:39:40.490 align:start position:0%

the concern was and I spoke with
 
01:39:48.470 --> 01:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
um Catherine Coco who is the head of New
 
01:39:50.330 --> 01:39:50.340 align:start position:0%

the Children's Advocacy group in New in
 
01:40:02.510 --> 01:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and their concern was they
 
01:40:07.030 --> 01:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
didn't want an abusive parent
 
01:40:09.709 --> 01:40:09.719 align:start position:0%
overwhelming the other parent in
 
01:40:13.310 --> 01:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
choosing a counselor so only in the case
 
01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
of abuse one of the parents is abusive
 
01:40:19.610 --> 01:40:19.620 align:start position:0%
it is likely that the the two parents
 
01:40:22.370 --> 01:40:22.380 align:start position:0%
would not agree on a counselor and so
 
01:40:24.770 --> 01:40:24.780 align:start position:0%
only in that instance would then the
 
01:40:27.890 --> 01:40:27.900 align:start position:0%
court make the decision about who making
 
01:40:30.830 --> 01:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
a fair and even decision about who the
 
01:40:33.290 --> 01:40:33.300 align:start position:0%
counselor would be
 
01:40:34.850 --> 01:40:34.860 align:start position:0%
follow up for representative you okay
 
01:40:36.830 --> 01:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
okay okay and I think it would
 
01:40:40.610 --> 01:40:40.620 align:start position:0%
discourage marital Wars over what
 
01:40:41.990 --> 01:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
counselor that they were going to pick
 
01:40:45.770 --> 01:40:45.780 align:start position:0%

of the committee
 
01:44:11.830 --> 01:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:14.990 --> 01:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
it it's uh
 
01:44:18.649 --> 01:44:18.659 align:start position:0%
just trying to speed up the process
 
01:44:21.709 --> 01:44:21.719 align:start position:0%
um as far as or encourage the judicial
 
01:44:23.990 --> 01:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
system and the lawyers to speed up the
 
01:44:25.970 --> 01:44:25.980 align:start position:0%
process and reach a conclusion in
 
01:44:28.790 --> 01:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
divorce cases by
 
01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:29.410 align:start position:0%
divorce cases by
um

01:44:29.410 --> 01:44:29.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:33.649 --> 01:44:33.659 align:start position:0%
when a temporary order is given that the
 
01:44:35.350 --> 01:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
court shall
 
01:44:38.930 --> 01:44:38.940 align:start position:0%
schedule a final disposition hearing
 
01:44:41.689 --> 01:44:41.699 align:start position:0%
and they would be able to reschedule
 
01:44:44.030 --> 01:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
that for Just Cause
 
01:44:47.689 --> 01:44:47.699 align:start position:0%
um but the uh there's a couple of things
 
01:44:50.390 --> 01:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:44:55.010 --> 01:44:55.020 align:start position:0%
at the uh temporary order they have some
 
01:44:58.010 --> 01:44:58.020 align:start position:0%
sense of the case and so they should be
 
01:45:02.149 --> 01:45:02.159 align:start position:0%
able to know or have a better idea of of
 
01:45:04.850 --> 01:45:04.860 align:start position:0%
how long the case is actually going to
 
01:45:08.030 --> 01:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
need and so there is uh so that they
 
01:45:10.070 --> 01:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
would be able to schedule it because
 
01:45:13.310 --> 01:45:13.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes that a case may be an hour
 
01:45:15.950 --> 01:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
long or multiple days long and so at
 
01:45:17.990 --> 01:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
this um
 
01:45:20.090 --> 01:45:20.100 align:start position:0%
temporary order they would have some
 
01:45:22.910 --> 01:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
evidence of the complex complexity of
 
01:45:26.030 --> 01:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
the case and then also
 
01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:26.810 align:start position:0%
the case and then also
um

01:45:26.810 --> 01:45:26.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:31.910 --> 01:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
in uh hb124 from rep D Simone that you
 
01:45:36.169 --> 01:45:36.179 align:start position:0%
guys heard on the 10th there is uh
 
01:45:40.609 --> 01:45:40.619 align:start position:0%
not uh for for alimony temporary alimony
 
01:45:44.030 --> 01:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
it is not counted towards your time for
 
01:45:44.040 --> 01:45:45.590 align:start position:0%
it is not counted towards your time for
uh

01:45:45.590 --> 01:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:45:48.290 --> 01:45:48.300 align:start position:0%
total duration of alimony
 
01:45:51.050 --> 01:45:51.060 align:start position:0%
which is set right now to be half the
 
01:45:53.390 --> 01:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
time of the the marriage the maximum
 
01:45:57.050 --> 01:45:57.060 align:start position:0%
time so if you drag on uh having
 
01:45:59.030 --> 01:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
temporary alimony for a year or two
 
01:46:01.729 --> 01:46:01.739 align:start position:0%
years then that's really eating into
 
01:46:04.189 --> 01:46:04.199 align:start position:0%
um it's it's not really making
 
01:46:07.250 --> 01:46:07.260 align:start position:0%
um our limit of the temporary alimony or
 
01:46:09.350 --> 01:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
the limit of alimony being half of the
 
01:46:11.090 --> 01:46:11.100 align:start position:0%
marriage really
 
01:46:11.100 --> 01:46:12.229 align:start position:0%
marriage really
um

01:46:12.229 --> 01:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:12.239 --> 01:46:14.689 align:start position:0%
um
appropriate

01:46:14.689 --> 01:46:14.699 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
um hopefully
 
01:46:19.129 --> 01:46:19.139 align:start position:0%
um I don't I'm not sure if you guys
 
01:46:21.050 --> 01:46:21.060 align:start position:0%
voted that one uh
 
01:46:25.850 --> 01:46:25.860 align:start position:0%
uh hb124 uh odd to pass but hopefully
 
01:46:28.430 --> 01:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
that will be another way of of
 
01:46:28.440 --> 01:46:30.410 align:start position:0%
that will be another way of of
addressing

01:46:30.410 --> 01:46:30.420 align:start position:0%
addressing
 
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
um kind of ongoing uh temporary
 
01:46:36.890 --> 01:46:36.900 align:start position:0%
alimonies that just live in uh for you
 
01:46:38.689 --> 01:46:38.699 align:start position:0%
know a year or more
 
01:46:41.270 --> 01:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
um but the idea of this is just to have
 
01:46:43.490 --> 01:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
something on the books so that everyone
 
01:46:45.830 --> 01:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
knows kind of like we're shooting for
 
01:46:50.209 --> 01:46:50.219 align:start position:0%
this date as far as ending this ending
 
01:46:52.790 --> 01:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
this uh proceeding so that the courts
 
01:46:55.189 --> 01:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
are not tied up as long and
 
01:46:55.199 --> 01:46:55.910 align:start position:0%
are not tied up as long and
um

01:46:55.910 --> 01:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:58.550 --> 01:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
and also just have everyone kind of on
 
01:46:59.990 --> 01:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
the same page and shooting for the same
 
01:47:03.070 --> 01:47:03.080 align:start position:0%
goal instead of just
 
01:47:05.870 --> 01:47:05.880 align:start position:0%
issuing the order and then
 
01:47:08.390 --> 01:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh it just be kind of out in the void
 
01:47:10.430 --> 01:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
about whether or not when this divorce
 
01:47:12.109 --> 01:47:12.119 align:start position:0%
is actually going to end like the
 
01:47:14.570 --> 01:47:14.580 align:start position:0%
divorce proceeding is going to end
 
01:47:17.330 --> 01:47:17.340 align:start position:0%
um and so that's kind of my my gist of
 
01:47:19.609 --> 01:47:19.619 align:start position:0%
this this bill
 
01:47:19.619 --> 01:47:20.270 align:start position:0%
this this bill
um

01:47:20.270 --> 01:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:26.270 --> 01:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
and there was some suggestion of uh
 
01:47:29.390 --> 01:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
um the judicial branch
 
01:47:32.030 --> 01:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
uh using their scheduling conference
 
01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:33.590 align:start position:0%
uh using their scheduling conference
order

01:47:33.590 --> 01:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
order
 
01:47:35.270 --> 01:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
um and and
 
01:47:38.209 --> 01:47:38.219 align:start position:0%
from from a constituent but I don't
 
01:47:40.010 --> 01:47:40.020 align:start position:0%
believe that this the the scheduling
 
01:47:41.270 --> 01:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
conference order
 
01:47:42.709 --> 01:47:42.719 align:start position:0%
um it's kind of like a checklist of
 
01:47:44.390 --> 01:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
things that they that they could order
 
01:47:47.270 --> 01:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
and so I don't think it's appropriate it
 
01:47:49.070 --> 01:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
to what I'm trying to do which is
 
01:47:51.770 --> 01:47:51.780 align:start position:0%
actually get a final hearing scheduled
 
01:47:53.450 --> 01:47:53.460 align:start position:0%
on the book so everyone's shooting for
 
01:47:56.209 --> 01:47:56.219 align:start position:0%
that that date and so
 
01:47:59.750 --> 01:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully you will be uh in favor of
 
01:48:02.090 --> 01:48:02.100 align:start position:0%
this and voted off to pass I'm happy to
 
01:48:04.430 --> 01:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
01:48:09.830 --> 01:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:11.930 --> 01:48:11.940 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford
 
01:48:14.270 --> 01:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm not that
 
01:48:17.390 --> 01:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
familiar with what happens now
 
01:48:19.070 --> 01:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
um but I have heard people say it takes
 
01:48:20.930 --> 01:48:20.940 align:start position:0%
a long time and is that what we're
 
01:48:23.090 --> 01:48:23.100 align:start position:0%
trying to address here is the on and on
 
01:48:25.490 --> 01:48:25.500 align:start position:0%
and on so if you can elaborate on that
 
01:48:29.629 --> 01:48:29.639 align:start position:0%
please yes thank you for the question I
 
01:48:32.030 --> 01:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
it is my understanding from the from the
 
01:48:34.010 --> 01:48:34.020 align:start position:0%
testimony that I've heard before when I
 
01:48:36.649 --> 01:48:36.659 align:start position:0%
was on this committee and then also from
 
01:48:39.530 --> 01:48:39.540 align:start position:0%
uh from lawyers that they do see that
 
01:48:41.990 --> 01:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
that cases are dragging unnecessarily
 
01:48:45.109 --> 01:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
long and one of the reasons is that
 
01:48:48.290 --> 01:48:48.300 align:start position:0%
there is no like set final date and so
 
01:48:51.109 --> 01:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
they're just they're just making motions
 
01:48:54.530 --> 01:48:54.540 align:start position:0%
whenever they they feel like it and
 
01:48:56.510 --> 01:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
um not really trying to reach a
 
01:48:58.370 --> 01:48:58.380 align:start position:0%
resolution by a specific date you know
 
01:48:59.990 --> 01:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
the lawyers
 
01:49:02.390 --> 01:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
if it drags on for a longer amount of
 
01:49:04.669 --> 01:49:04.679 align:start position:0%
time they're going to get more money so
 
01:49:07.970 --> 01:49:07.980 align:start position:0%
there's no real uh incentive for them to
 
01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
call for a final hearing
 
01:49:12.890 --> 01:49:12.900 align:start position:0%
um and so that's that's one of the
 
01:49:14.330 --> 01:49:14.340 align:start position:0%
reasons why we're trying to kind of
 
01:49:17.209 --> 01:49:17.219 align:start position:0%
incentivize the courts to say hey this
 
01:49:19.010 --> 01:49:19.020 align:start position:0%
may not be the final day because they
 
01:49:21.229 --> 01:49:21.239 align:start position:0%
could motion to say hey we need a longer
 
01:49:23.030 --> 01:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
time frame you scheduled this for a
 
01:49:24.530 --> 01:49:24.540 align:start position:0%
two-day hearing and it's going to be you
 
01:49:25.910 --> 01:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
know four days or something like that so
 
01:49:28.609 --> 01:49:28.619 align:start position:0%
we need to reschedule or you know
 
01:49:30.530 --> 01:49:30.540 align:start position:0%
there's a legit reason that we need to
 
01:49:32.510 --> 01:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
reschedule and it needs to be pushed out
 
01:49:34.129 --> 01:49:34.139 align:start position:0%
further but
 
01:49:34.139 --> 01:49:35.570 align:start position:0%
further but
um

01:49:35.570 --> 01:49:35.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:37.970 --> 01:49:37.980 align:start position:0%
it's my opinion that they should kind of
 
01:49:39.530 --> 01:49:39.540 align:start position:0%
have to prove that that's that's
 
01:49:42.430 --> 01:49:42.440 align:start position:0%
necessary otherwise they should you know
 
01:49:46.010 --> 01:49:46.020 align:start position:0%
try and resolve this within
 
01:49:47.990 --> 01:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
um a reasonable amount of time thank you
 
01:49:49.430 --> 01:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:49:53.090 --> 01:49:53.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:55.129 --> 01:49:55.139 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond
 
01:49:58.250 --> 01:49:58.260 align:start position:0%
thank you so currently
 
01:50:01.250 --> 01:50:01.260 align:start position:0%
um when people seeking divorce go to
 
01:50:03.649 --> 01:50:03.659 align:start position:0%
court the court issues
 
01:50:05.450 --> 01:50:05.460 align:start position:0%
um the temporary relief and then they
 
01:50:08.810 --> 01:50:08.820 align:start position:0%
order the parties to mediation and they
 
01:50:10.310 --> 01:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
have their court ordered time for
 
01:50:13.070 --> 01:50:13.080 align:start position:0%
mediation you want them to also at that
 
01:50:16.609 --> 01:50:16.619 align:start position:0%
time before mediation happens order a
 
01:50:18.109 --> 01:50:18.119 align:start position:0%
basically a trial date for the
 
01:50:19.910 --> 01:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
dispositional hearing
 
01:50:22.129 --> 01:50:22.139 align:start position:0%
is that just so I'm understanding what
 
01:50:23.870 --> 01:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
you're asked what the Bill's intention
 
01:50:23.880 --> 01:50:26.390 align:start position:0%
you're asked what the Bill's intention
is

01:50:26.390 --> 01:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:29.810 --> 01:50:29.820 align:start position:0%
I am not a hundred percent sure that
 
01:50:31.669 --> 01:50:31.679 align:start position:0%
that is the
 
01:50:33.649 --> 01:50:33.659 align:start position:0%
um normal flow like I think that they
 
01:50:36.290 --> 01:50:36.300 align:start position:0%
could go to mediation before the the
 
01:50:38.629 --> 01:50:38.639 align:start position:0%
temporary temporary order I don't I'm
 
01:50:40.850 --> 01:50:40.860 align:start position:0%
not sure that that is
 
01:50:40.860 --> 01:50:42.169 align:start position:0%
not sure that that is
um

01:50:42.169 --> 01:50:42.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:44.870 --> 01:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
completely like the exact flow and
 
01:50:47.090 --> 01:50:47.100 align:start position:0%
there's they're obviously uh Richard
 
01:50:48.830 --> 01:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
head is here and he'll be able to answer
 
01:50:51.470 --> 01:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
kind of like that flow as as far as that
 
01:50:53.689 --> 01:50:53.699 align:start position:0%
and he's more of an expert on that thank
 
01:50:53.699 --> 01:50:56.209 align:start position:0%
and he's more of an expert on that thank
you

01:50:56.209 --> 01:50:56.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:58.729 --> 01:50:58.739 align:start position:0%
yes representative McMahon thank you Mr
 
01:51:00.890 --> 01:51:00.900 align:start position:0%
chairman just one question sir sure do
 
01:51:02.450 --> 01:51:02.460 align:start position:0%
you disagree with the methodology
 
01:51:05.390 --> 01:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
description that's that states
 
01:51:07.669 --> 01:51:07.679 align:start position:0%
when temporary orders are issued
 
01:51:10.149 --> 01:51:10.159 align:start position:0%
that it's going to cost more money it's
 
01:51:14.990 --> 01:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
at the there's not a due process time if
 
01:51:19.010 --> 01:51:19.020 align:start position:0%
uh uh attendant should there be
 
01:51:22.129 --> 01:51:22.139 align:start position:0%
conflicts and and espresso implied
 
01:51:24.169 --> 01:51:24.179 align:start position:0%
agreement on what happens next if
 
01:51:26.330 --> 01:51:26.340 align:start position:0%
something else comes up
 
01:51:28.430 --> 01:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
I I know there's a class issue there as
 
01:51:30.490 --> 01:51:30.500 align:start position:0%
well but it's where it's saying with
 
01:51:32.689 --> 01:51:32.699 align:start position:0%
insufficiency inefficiencies in the
 
01:51:36.290 --> 01:51:36.300 align:start position:0%
course schedule to then hear complaints
 
01:51:39.950 --> 01:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
or disagreements in the be prior to the
 
01:51:44.090 --> 01:51:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:46.070 --> 01:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question I think
 
01:51:48.290 --> 01:51:48.300 align:start position:0%
you're talking about this the um the
 
01:51:49.609 --> 01:51:49.619 align:start position:0%
sentence that says the branch states
 
01:51:51.770 --> 01:51:51.780 align:start position:0%
that the bill may result in
 
01:51:54.050 --> 01:51:54.060 align:start position:0%
um significant inefficiencies in the
 
01:51:54.060 --> 01:51:55.370 align:start position:0%
um significant inefficiencies in the
court

01:51:55.370 --> 01:51:55.380 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:51:57.109 --> 01:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
um scheduled by booking hearings without
 
01:51:59.930 --> 01:51:59.940 align:start position:0%
knowing time restraints or if hearings
 
01:52:03.169 --> 01:52:03.179 align:start position:0%
are needed no if I may be it's the third
 
01:52:05.090 --> 01:52:05.100 align:start position:0%
sentence less likely to know what issues
 
01:52:06.890 --> 01:52:06.900 align:start position:0%
if any will be contested by the time of
 
01:52:08.149 --> 01:52:08.159 align:start position:0%
the final hearing
 
01:52:10.550 --> 01:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh doesn't due process then affected I
 
01:52:14.570 --> 01:52:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:17.510 --> 01:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question uh
 
01:52:20.149 --> 01:52:20.159 align:start position:0%
I don't believe so because if there was
 
01:52:23.090 --> 01:52:23.100 align:start position:0%
an issue with that you needed to address
 
01:52:26.390 --> 01:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
before the disposition you could then
 
01:52:29.629 --> 01:52:29.639 align:start position:0%
just request uh the hearing be moved
 
01:52:32.450 --> 01:52:32.460 align:start position:0%
under this under the the language of the
 
01:52:32.460 --> 01:52:33.649 align:start position:0%
under this under the the language of the
bill

01:52:33.649 --> 01:52:33.659 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:52:33.659 --> 01:52:34.250 align:start position:0%
bill
um

01:52:34.250 --> 01:52:34.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:36.410 --> 01:52:36.420 align:start position:0%
the second sentence says the court May
 
01:52:38.270 --> 01:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
reschedule the final disappearing for
 
01:52:40.129 --> 01:52:40.139 align:start position:0%
just cause so that the lawyers could
 
01:52:42.830 --> 01:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
just ask and say hey this I need you
 
01:52:44.689 --> 01:52:44.699 align:start position:0%
know to have a hearing on this and it
 
01:52:46.609 --> 01:52:46.619 align:start position:0%
needs to be heard before the
 
01:52:49.250 --> 01:52:49.260 align:start position:0%
um the final disposition hearing and so
 
01:52:51.410 --> 01:52:51.420 align:start position:0%
we need to push this final disposition
 
01:52:53.689 --> 01:52:53.699 align:start position:0%
hearing out you know another three
 
01:52:56.810 --> 01:52:56.820 align:start position:0%
months or whatever so so I do believe
 
01:52:59.870 --> 01:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
that all of those issues
 
01:53:02.090 --> 01:53:02.100 align:start position:0%
um would be able to be addressed
 
01:53:04.729 --> 01:53:04.739 align:start position:0%
and and it wouldn't you know
 
01:53:04.739 --> 01:53:06.250 align:start position:0%
and and it wouldn't you know
uh

01:53:06.250 --> 01:53:06.260 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:53:10.070 --> 01:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
be contrary to either the person's
 
01:53:13.550 --> 01:53:13.560 align:start position:0%
rights for what they can can have
 
01:53:17.090 --> 01:53:17.100 align:start position:0%
hearings on or contrary to
 
01:53:19.490 --> 01:53:19.500 align:start position:0%
like the best interest of of you know
 
01:53:22.070 --> 01:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
Finding Justice
 
01:53:23.470 --> 01:53:23.480 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
01:53:25.189 --> 01:53:25.199 align:start position:0%
anyone else with a question
 
01:53:27.470 --> 01:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
representative Greg
 
01:53:29.149 --> 01:53:29.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:53:31.129 --> 01:53:31.139 align:start position:0%
being here today and uh presenting this
 
01:53:34.430 --> 01:53:34.440 align:start position:0%
so I just wonder if you know there's no
 
01:53:36.470 --> 01:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
it says that they can reschedule with
 
01:53:39.229 --> 01:53:39.239 align:start position:0%
just cause or whatever how does this tie
 
01:53:41.390 --> 01:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
the courts if like the day before they
 
01:53:43.790 --> 01:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
decide oh we can't do it tomorrow you
 
01:53:45.709 --> 01:53:45.719 align:start position:0%
know the courts have this date reserved
 
01:53:47.810 --> 01:53:47.820 align:start position:0%
and what that does with like costs
 
01:53:49.370 --> 01:53:49.380 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness all that kind of stuff
 
01:53:51.410 --> 01:53:51.420 align:start position:0%
like there's no
 
01:53:53.450 --> 01:53:53.460 align:start position:0%
you need to like if we're going to say
 
01:53:55.609 --> 01:53:55.619 align:start position:0%
okay you have to set this date there's
 
01:53:57.709 --> 01:53:57.719 align:start position:0%
no like cancellation policy of like we
 
01:53:59.629 --> 01:53:59.639 align:start position:0%
need to change it you know like thinking
 
01:54:02.030 --> 01:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
in today's terms like what what does
 
01:54:03.890 --> 01:54:03.900 align:start position:0%
that do as far as like I would think
 
01:54:05.450 --> 01:54:05.460 align:start position:0%
that that could actually complicate it
 
01:54:08.629 --> 01:54:08.639 align:start position:0%
and back up the court more because if we
 
01:54:10.669 --> 01:54:10.679 align:start position:0%
have dates reserved and then we're not
 
01:54:13.430 --> 01:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
using them you know too close to time
 
01:54:15.770 --> 01:54:15.780 align:start position:0%
does that make sense
 
01:54:18.530 --> 01:54:18.540 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:54:20.990 --> 01:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
um I believe that that you know just
 
01:54:23.450 --> 01:54:23.460 align:start position:0%
cause like you got hit by a bus and
 
01:54:24.890 --> 01:54:24.900 align:start position:0%
you're in the hospital and you can't
 
01:54:28.070 --> 01:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
attend the hearing that seems like a
 
01:54:31.310 --> 01:54:31.320 align:start position:0%
that could happen at any hearing for if
 
01:54:33.649 --> 01:54:33.659 align:start position:0%
you know the day before
 
01:54:35.390 --> 01:54:35.400 align:start position:0%
um and so I'm not sure that this would
 
01:54:37.729 --> 01:54:37.739 align:start position:0%
necessarily be any different than any
 
01:54:39.410 --> 01:54:39.420 align:start position:0%
other time and you would it would need
 
01:54:40.790 --> 01:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:54:42.709 --> 01:54:42.719 align:start position:0%
um appropriate the judge would make a
 
01:54:44.570 --> 01:54:44.580 align:start position:0%
call if it's not if it's because you
 
01:54:46.129 --> 01:54:46.139 align:start position:0%
know you wouldn't weren't able to find a
 
01:54:48.050 --> 01:54:48.060 align:start position:0%
babysitter but you had nine months
 
01:54:50.450 --> 01:54:50.460 align:start position:0%
notice the the judge would probably be
 
01:54:52.310 --> 01:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
like that's just too bad you're gonna
 
01:54:53.629 --> 01:54:53.639 align:start position:0%
have to
 
01:54:55.189 --> 01:54:55.199 align:start position:0%
um you know we're not rescheduling for
 
01:54:57.350 --> 01:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
that that's not just cause
 
01:54:59.990 --> 01:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
right so it would be up to the judge to
 
01:55:01.370 --> 01:55:01.380 align:start position:0%
make that determination
 
01:55:04.129 --> 01:55:04.139 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:55:04.139 --> 01:55:06.530 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
follow-up

01:55:06.530 --> 01:55:06.540 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:55:08.870 --> 01:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
um so I guess I it's not so much like
 
01:55:10.729 --> 01:55:10.739 align:start position:0%
hit by a bus obviously we can't help
 
01:55:12.770 --> 01:55:12.780 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff it's more like so
 
01:55:14.450 --> 01:55:14.460 align:start position:0%
there are certain times um let's just
 
01:55:16.250 --> 01:55:16.260 align:start position:0%
say in contested divorces or whatever
 
01:55:17.330 --> 01:55:17.340 align:start position:0%
where you're supposed to have Financial
 
01:55:19.729 --> 01:55:19.739 align:start position:0%
disclosures but maybe if you already
 
01:55:21.410 --> 01:55:21.420 align:start position:0%
have the state set sometimes Financial
 
01:55:23.870 --> 01:55:23.880 align:start position:0%
disclosures come you know a month before
 
01:55:26.030 --> 01:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
or whatever two weeks before you have a
 
01:55:27.470 --> 01:55:27.480 align:start position:0%
grace period okay you have to get that
 
01:55:29.209 --> 01:55:29.219 align:start position:0%
in there but the financial disclosures
 
01:55:31.250 --> 01:55:31.260 align:start position:0%
aren't coming I mean divorce is never
 
01:55:33.950 --> 01:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
really a happy thing so there's a lot of
 
01:55:36.169 --> 01:55:36.179 align:start position:0%
times a lot of um you know kind of
 
01:55:37.910 --> 01:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
conflict in one party or another not
 
01:55:39.649 --> 01:55:39.659 align:start position:0%
giving what they need to give and so I
 
01:55:42.109 --> 01:55:42.119 align:start position:0%
can see actually just cause being pretty
 
01:55:44.810 --> 01:55:44.820 align:start position:0%
broad as far as okay well this party
 
01:55:48.229 --> 01:55:48.239 align:start position:0%
didn't give this and so it I I
 
01:55:51.109 --> 01:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm just wondering like um what
 
01:55:52.850 --> 01:55:52.860 align:start position:0%
the provision would be like if there
 
01:55:54.830 --> 01:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
would be any kind of like time frame
 
01:55:56.810 --> 01:55:56.820 align:start position:0%
just so we're not hanging up our courts
 
01:55:58.970 --> 01:55:58.980 align:start position:0%
and stuff I just that's my only thing
 
01:56:01.250 --> 01:56:01.260 align:start position:0%
with that car accidents totally
 
01:56:01.260 --> 01:56:03.470 align:start position:0%
with that car accidents totally
different

01:56:03.470 --> 01:56:03.480 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:56:05.629 --> 01:56:05.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for the follow-up
 
01:56:05.639 --> 01:56:09.050 align:start position:0%
thank you for the follow-up
um

01:56:09.050 --> 01:56:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:12.649 --> 01:56:12.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:14.450 --> 01:56:14.460 align:start position:0%
I guess
 
01:56:18.229 --> 01:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure how the courts are are
 
01:56:21.470 --> 01:56:21.480 align:start position:0%
tied up if they are not having the
 
01:56:21.480 --> 01:56:22.570 align:start position:0%
tied up if they are not having the
hearing

01:56:22.570 --> 01:56:22.580 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:56:26.149 --> 01:56:26.159 align:start position:0%
if they know you know multiple
 
01:56:27.970 --> 01:56:27.980 align:start position:0%
weeks in advance
 
01:56:30.410 --> 01:56:30.420 align:start position:0%
because they're supposed to be you know
 
01:56:30.420 --> 01:56:32.810 align:start position:0%
because they're supposed to be you know
exchanging

01:56:32.810 --> 01:56:32.820 align:start position:0%
exchanging
 
01:56:35.930 --> 01:56:35.940 align:start position:0%
um you know evidence multiple like weeks
 
01:56:37.910 --> 01:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
in advance and and all of these
 
01:56:39.950 --> 01:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
disclosures now
 
01:56:43.310 --> 01:56:43.320 align:start position:0%
there's a bigger problem of of people
 
01:56:45.709 --> 01:56:45.719 align:start position:0%
not actually exchanging those and no
 
01:56:48.470 --> 01:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanisms happening as far
 
01:56:48.480 --> 01:56:51.290 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanisms happening as far
as

01:56:51.290 --> 01:56:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:53.330 --> 01:56:53.340 align:start position:0%
as far as that and I do think that that
 
01:56:55.010 --> 01:56:55.020 align:start position:0%
kind of goes back to the question about
 
01:56:56.510 --> 01:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
whether or not you can actually
 
01:56:59.209 --> 01:56:59.219 align:start position:0%
represent yourself or or defend yourself
 
01:57:01.970 --> 01:57:01.980 align:start position:0%
or is is Justice being served if these
 
01:57:04.310 --> 01:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
things are not actually happening
 
01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:05.030 align:start position:0%
things are not actually happening
um

01:57:05.030 --> 01:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:07.010 --> 01:57:07.020 align:start position:0%
and so I'm more definitely more
 
01:57:09.649 --> 01:57:09.659 align:start position:0%
concerned about that than
 
01:57:09.659 --> 01:57:10.310 align:start position:0%
concerned about that than
um

01:57:10.310 --> 01:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:13.310 --> 01:57:13.320 align:start position:0%
then scheduling out because I assume
 
01:57:16.189 --> 01:57:16.199 align:start position:0%
that they're going to be scheduling out
 
01:57:18.530 --> 01:57:18.540 align:start position:0%
of a decent amount of time like six or
 
01:57:19.910 --> 01:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
eight months it's not going to be like
 
01:57:21.229 --> 01:57:21.239 align:start position:0%
next week we're going to do the final
 
01:57:23.209 --> 01:57:23.219 align:start position:0%
deposition hearing and so you'll have
 
01:57:26.629 --> 01:57:26.639 align:start position:0%
plenty of time to know what
 
01:57:28.689 --> 01:57:28.699 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:57:31.910 --> 01:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
what the final date is and be shooting
 
01:57:33.350 --> 01:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
for that and trying to get things
 
01:57:36.530 --> 01:57:36.540 align:start position:0%
resolved you know months in advance and
 
01:57:38.750 --> 01:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
if you're not able to then you would be
 
01:57:41.629 --> 01:57:41.639 align:start position:0%
requesting a continuance and say that
 
01:57:43.370 --> 01:57:43.380 align:start position:0%
you know just cause we haven't been able
 
01:57:45.169 --> 01:57:45.179 align:start position:0%
to resolve this we thought we were going
 
01:57:47.270 --> 01:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
to be able to resolve
 
01:57:51.229 --> 01:57:51.239 align:start position:0%
um you know my Bahama house and I and
 
01:57:53.209 --> 01:57:53.219 align:start position:0%
we're not able to and so we're gonna
 
01:57:54.709 --> 01:57:54.719 align:start position:0%
need to push it out another three months
 
01:57:57.890 --> 01:57:57.900 align:start position:0%
or something like that I think that it
 
01:58:01.490 --> 01:58:01.500 align:start position:0%
it would be rare that it would be in
 
01:58:03.530 --> 01:58:03.540 align:start position:0%
such a short time frame before the
 
01:58:05.750 --> 01:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
hearing that the court would essentially
 
01:58:09.169 --> 01:58:09.179 align:start position:0%
be forced to be empty for that
 
01:58:10.490 --> 01:58:10.500 align:start position:0%
um because
 
01:58:12.770 --> 01:58:12.780 align:start position:0%
uh you know there's no there's no cases
 
01:58:15.169 --> 01:58:15.179 align:start position:0%
to schedule in that time frame because
 
01:58:16.669 --> 01:58:16.679 align:start position:0%
there was such short notice kind of a
 
01:58:19.189 --> 01:58:19.199 align:start position:0%
thing I'm not sure that
 
01:58:19.199 --> 01:58:20.570 align:start position:0%
thing I'm not sure that
um

01:58:20.570 --> 01:58:20.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:22.010 --> 01:58:22.020 align:start position:0%
how often that that would be the case
 
01:58:23.870 --> 01:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
but obviously Richard head will be here
 
01:58:28.310 --> 01:58:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:34.089 --> 01:58:34.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:37.790 --> 01:58:37.800 align:start position:0%
representative DeSimone
 
01:58:39.950 --> 01:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:58:41.270 --> 01:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you question and welcome back
 
01:58:44.390 --> 01:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:48.410 --> 01:58:48.420 align:start position:0%
I just want to be clear that this bill
 
01:58:52.669 --> 01:58:52.679 align:start position:0%
does in no way prevent anybody from
 
01:58:54.890 --> 01:58:54.900 align:start position:0%
applying for
 
01:58:54.900 --> 01:58:55.669 align:start position:0%
applying for
um

01:58:55.669 --> 01:58:55.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:58.490 --> 01:58:58.500 align:start position:0%
a continuance
 
01:59:01.550 --> 01:59:01.560 align:start position:0%
at any time am I correct
 
01:59:05.089 --> 01:59:05.099 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question yes this this
 
01:59:07.310 --> 01:59:07.320 align:start position:0%
uh does not mandate that the courts
 
01:59:09.470 --> 01:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
schedule a specific time frame it
 
01:59:11.149 --> 01:59:11.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that
 
01:59:13.129 --> 01:59:13.139 align:start position:0%
um you're not able to get a continuance
 
01:59:15.589 --> 01:59:15.599 align:start position:0%
it's just trying to put something on the
 
01:59:17.689 --> 01:59:17.699 align:start position:0%
book so that everyone is shooting for a
 
01:59:20.330 --> 01:59:20.340 align:start position:0%
goal and not mandating that you have to
 
01:59:22.310 --> 01:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
do it within six months or a year or
 
01:59:25.250 --> 01:59:25.260 align:start position:0%
whatever you if if the courts you know
 
01:59:27.890 --> 01:59:27.900 align:start position:0%
were able to schedule out five years in
 
01:59:30.169 --> 01:59:30.179 align:start position:0%
advance they could schedule it out five
 
01:59:33.290 --> 01:59:33.300 align:start position:0%
years with my and be in compliance with
 
01:59:35.510 --> 01:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
my bill there's no
 
01:59:37.609 --> 01:59:37.619 align:start position:0%
um it's just trying to have an end date
 
01:59:41.649 --> 01:59:41.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:44.209 --> 01:59:44.219 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions
 
01:59:45.709 --> 01:59:45.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
01:59:48.709 --> 01:59:48.719 align:start position:0%
representative thank you and
 
01:59:51.229 --> 01:59:51.239 align:start position:0%
now we call on
 
02:00:06.589 --> 02:00:06.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:08.270 --> 02:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman members of the
 
02:00:09.709 --> 02:00:09.719 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Richard head I'm
 
02:00:11.510 --> 02:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
the government Affairs coordinator for
 
02:00:14.510 --> 02:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch we do not support
 
02:00:16.609 --> 02:00:16.619 align:start position:0%
this bill and and I just want to briefly
 
02:00:19.129 --> 02:00:19.139 align:start position:0%
explain why that is
 
02:00:21.830 --> 02:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
one of the sort of what I would describe
 
02:00:23.810 --> 02:00:23.820 align:start position:0%
as the most important and valuable
 
02:00:26.629 --> 02:00:26.639 align:start position:0%
resources the court system has is the
 
02:00:29.089 --> 02:00:29.099 align:start position:0%
Court's docket that's the the place
 
02:00:31.669 --> 02:00:31.679 align:start position:0%
where people's where everyone's hearing
 
02:00:33.950 --> 02:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
is going to be scheduled and when a
 
02:00:35.810 --> 02:00:35.820 align:start position:0%
hearing is scheduled someone else is
 
02:00:38.629 --> 02:00:38.639 align:start position:0%
hearing cannot be scheduled obviously
 
02:00:41.990 --> 02:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
um so you know to the extent somebody is
 
02:00:44.030 --> 02:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
getting a hearing it means somebody else
 
02:00:46.970 --> 02:00:46.980 align:start position:0%
is not getting a hearing it's just sort
 
02:00:49.970 --> 02:00:49.980 align:start position:0%
of the inevitable process of blocking
 
02:00:53.030 --> 02:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
off time on a docket
 
02:00:54.890 --> 02:00:54.900 align:start position:0%
the other aspect of this bill is that
 
02:00:56.810 --> 02:00:56.820 align:start position:0%
not we
 
02:00:59.330 --> 02:00:59.340 align:start position:0%
one size does not fit all cases are
 
02:00:59.340 --> 02:01:00.470 align:start position:0%
one size does not fit all cases are
different

02:01:00.470 --> 02:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:01:04.550 --> 02:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
um and each case has its own sort of
 
02:01:10.970 --> 02:01:10.980 align:start position:0%
issues and uh uh process and and
 
02:01:13.430 --> 02:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
early on in a case we do not know what
 
02:01:14.990 --> 02:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
all the issues are that are going to be
 
02:01:18.050 --> 02:01:18.060 align:start position:0%
heard at the end of the case there is a
 
02:01:20.570 --> 02:01:20.580 align:start position:0%
a process and a goal of the courts to
 
02:01:23.750 --> 02:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
have the parties reach agreement and to
 
02:01:27.050 --> 02:01:27.060 align:start position:0%
try to resolve issues and as issues get
 
02:01:30.589 --> 02:01:30.599 align:start position:0%
resolved the the time necessary for a
 
02:01:32.570 --> 02:01:32.580 align:start position:0%
final hearing which is essentially the
 
02:01:35.410 --> 02:01:35.420 align:start position:0%
the final trial
 
02:01:38.810 --> 02:01:38.820 align:start position:0%
hopefully become less less complex and
 
02:01:40.609 --> 02:01:40.619 align:start position:0%
the the amount of time needed for the
 
02:01:43.250 --> 02:01:43.260 align:start position:0%
hearing is reduced
 
02:01:45.890 --> 02:01:45.900 align:start position:0%
so the question one question is early on
 
02:01:47.629 --> 02:01:47.639 align:start position:0%
in the case how long do we schedule the
 
02:01:50.330 --> 02:01:50.340 align:start position:0%
case for a final dispositional hearing
 
02:01:52.910 --> 02:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
can take an hour it could take two days
 
02:01:55.310 --> 02:01:55.320 align:start position:0%
it could take five days it really
 
02:01:57.229 --> 02:01:57.239 align:start position:0%
depends on who are the witnesses what
 
02:01:59.629 --> 02:01:59.639 align:start position:0%
are the issues what needs to be heard
 
02:02:02.450 --> 02:02:02.460 align:start position:0%
and they're not sort of known early on
 
02:02:04.070 --> 02:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
in the process
 
02:02:07.430 --> 02:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
and and the other aspect of this is this
 
02:02:09.169 --> 02:02:09.179 align:start position:0%
bill would trigger the Court's
 
02:02:11.629 --> 02:02:11.639 align:start position:0%
obligation to schedule a hearing or the
 
02:02:12.890 --> 02:02:12.900 align:start position:0%
final hearing
 
02:02:15.770 --> 02:02:15.780 align:start position:0%
of some length of time whether it's an
 
02:02:17.709 --> 02:02:17.719 align:start position:0%
hour two days five days
 
02:02:20.930 --> 02:02:20.940 align:start position:0%
at the point of a of the issuance of a
 
02:02:23.209 --> 02:02:23.219 align:start position:0%
temporary order and it's amending RSA
 
02:02:27.350 --> 02:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
458 16. so I think it is important to
 
02:02:29.750 --> 02:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
understand what is a temporary order and
 
02:02:32.390 --> 02:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
when does it happen so a temporary order
 
02:02:36.070 --> 02:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
under in a sort of a list in in RSA
 
02:02:36.080 --> 02:02:37.870 align:start position:0%
under in a sort of a list in in RSA
45816

02:02:37.870 --> 02:02:37.880 align:start position:0%
45816
 
02:02:40.070 --> 02:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
and also says very specifically
 
02:02:42.950 --> 02:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
temporary orders can be ex parte these
 
02:02:45.050 --> 02:02:45.060 align:start position:0%
can happen very early in the process
 
02:02:48.070 --> 02:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
essentially at the point of filing
 
02:02:50.629 --> 02:02:50.639 align:start position:0%
directing any party to refrain from
 
02:02:52.850 --> 02:02:52.860 align:start position:0%
abusing or interfering in any way with a
 
02:02:55.189 --> 02:02:55.199 align:start position:0%
person or Liberty of the other party in
 
02:02:56.810 --> 02:02:56.820 align:start position:0%
joining any party from entering the
 
02:02:59.530 --> 02:02:59.540 align:start position:0%
premises enjoying any party from
 
02:03:01.669 --> 02:03:01.679 align:start position:0%
contacting any other party and partially
 
02:03:04.010 --> 02:03:04.020 align:start position:0%
reading these for time enjoining any
 
02:03:05.810 --> 02:03:05.820 align:start position:0%
other party from harassing intimidating
 
02:03:07.270 --> 02:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
or threatening
 
02:03:09.709 --> 02:03:09.719 align:start position:0%
determining the temporary custody and
 
02:03:11.629 --> 02:03:11.639 align:start position:0%
maintenance of minor children ordering
 
02:03:14.390 --> 02:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
temporary allowance and joining a party
 
02:03:16.010 --> 02:03:16.020 align:start position:0%
from transferring and cumbering
 
02:03:18.169 --> 02:03:18.179 align:start position:0%
hypothecating concealing someone et
 
02:03:19.850 --> 02:03:19.860 align:start position:0%
cetera property
 
02:03:22.310 --> 02:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
those are the temporary orders that get
 
02:03:24.470 --> 02:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
issued so some of these might even occur
 
02:03:26.810 --> 02:03:26.820 align:start position:0%
before parties appeared we don't know
 
02:03:28.310 --> 02:03:28.320 align:start position:0%
anything about the case we only know
 
02:03:31.870 --> 02:03:31.880 align:start position:0%
that there's a an initial uh
 
02:03:34.370 --> 02:03:34.380 align:start position:0%
filing there's a request for a temporary
 
02:03:36.410 --> 02:03:36.420 align:start position:0%
order it may be export date maybe with
 
02:03:38.330 --> 02:03:38.340 align:start position:0%
the parties exporting meaning the other
 
02:03:40.430 --> 02:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
party is not there
 
02:03:40.440 --> 02:03:41.089 align:start position:0%
party is not there
um

02:03:41.089 --> 02:03:41.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:43.250 --> 02:03:43.260 align:start position:0%
we don't know anything about the case at
 
02:03:45.790 --> 02:03:45.800 align:start position:0%
that point in terms of being able to
 
02:03:48.890 --> 02:03:48.900 align:start position:0%
intelligently identify when how long
 
02:03:50.810 --> 02:03:50.820 align:start position:0%
sort of who are the witnesses what's
 
02:03:53.510 --> 02:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
going on in that in that final hearing
 
02:03:55.430 --> 02:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
even if we got a little bit later into
 
02:03:59.450 --> 02:03:59.460 align:start position:0%
the process there are a potentially in
 
02:04:01.790 --> 02:04:01.800 align:start position:0%
in not all cases some cases can in fact
 
02:04:04.790 --> 02:04:04.800 align:start position:0%
be be scheduled relatively early
 
02:04:07.550 --> 02:04:07.560 align:start position:0%
um but you know types of issues that
 
02:04:10.850 --> 02:04:10.860 align:start position:0%
judges see in in divorce cases you know
 
02:04:12.589 --> 02:04:12.599 align:start position:0%
are there abuse and neglect issues when
 
02:04:14.629 --> 02:04:14.639 align:start position:0%
you get into the financials is there a
 
02:04:15.830 --> 02:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
business does there have to be a
 
02:04:17.570 --> 02:04:17.580 align:start position:0%
business valuation
 
02:04:20.089 --> 02:04:20.099 align:start position:0%
if somebody is self-employed is there a
 
02:04:22.669 --> 02:04:22.679 align:start position:0%
self-employment valuation needed is
 
02:04:24.050 --> 02:04:24.060 align:start position:0%
there a house at issue does the house
 
02:04:26.689 --> 02:04:26.699 align:start position:0%
need to be appraised if there's a
 
02:04:29.450 --> 02:04:29.460 align:start position:0%
guardian ad litem how extensive is the
 
02:04:31.370 --> 02:04:31.380 align:start position:0%
guardian item's involvement going to be
 
02:04:33.470 --> 02:04:33.480 align:start position:0%
in a final hearing what are the support
 
02:04:33.480 --> 02:04:34.689 align:start position:0%
in a final hearing what are the support
issues

02:04:34.689 --> 02:04:34.699 align:start position:0%
issues
 
02:04:36.830 --> 02:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
income and expense calculations
 
02:04:39.790 --> 02:04:39.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes require some iterations
 
02:04:42.530 --> 02:04:42.540 align:start position:0%
asset valuation generally if they have
 
02:04:45.410 --> 02:04:45.420 align:start position:0%
our IRAs Roth standards stock options
 
02:04:47.930 --> 02:04:47.940 align:start position:0%
those need to be potentially evaluated
 
02:04:50.330 --> 02:04:50.340 align:start position:0%
and valued during the course of the
 
02:04:53.629 --> 02:04:53.639 align:start position:0%
discovery in these cases if there's an
 
02:04:55.450 --> 02:04:55.460 align:start position:0%
underemployment issue somebody is
 
02:04:59.149 --> 02:04:59.159 align:start position:0%
underemployed uh you know how do we how
 
02:05:00.830 --> 02:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
is that information and evidence going
 
02:05:02.209 --> 02:05:02.219 align:start position:0%
to be discovered and ultimately
 
02:05:04.030 --> 02:05:04.040 align:start position:0%
presented to the court
 
02:05:06.890 --> 02:05:06.900 align:start position:0%
are there child counseling issues does
 
02:05:08.629 --> 02:05:08.639 align:start position:0%
the child do we need to get through a
 
02:05:11.089 --> 02:05:11.099 align:start position:0%
process with a child or does there have
 
02:05:13.790 --> 02:05:13.800 align:start position:0%
to be a temporary parenting order
 
02:05:16.910 --> 02:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
in which the really the parties in the
 
02:05:19.250 --> 02:05:19.260 align:start position:0%
court need to evaluate is that temporary
 
02:05:21.950 --> 02:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
process ordered working in a way that
 
02:05:24.129 --> 02:05:24.139 align:start position:0%
can be put into a final order
 
02:05:26.570 --> 02:05:26.580 align:start position:0%
or the adjustments need to be made
 
02:05:28.189 --> 02:05:28.199 align:start position:0%
because ultimately adjustments are
 
02:05:30.709 --> 02:05:30.719 align:start position:0%
easier in a temporary order than coming
 
02:05:34.129 --> 02:05:34.139 align:start position:0%
back after a final order is issued it is
 
02:05:35.810 --> 02:05:35.820 align:start position:0%
it is there are a lot of moving Parts
 
02:05:39.169 --> 02:05:39.179 align:start position:0%
it's complicated and what this bill
 
02:05:41.750 --> 02:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
would propose is that in all cases
 
02:05:45.169 --> 02:05:45.179 align:start position:0%
we have to schedule a final hearing at
 
02:05:47.450 --> 02:05:47.460 align:start position:0%
the point of temporary uh at the point
 
02:05:49.330 --> 02:05:49.340 align:start position:0%
of a temporary order
 
02:05:53.030 --> 02:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
and just creates a significant burden on
 
02:05:55.970 --> 02:05:55.980 align:start position:0%
the courts and and our ability to move
 
02:05:58.070 --> 02:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
things quickly and we do think at the
 
02:05:59.570 --> 02:05:59.580 align:start position:0%
end of the day this would create
 
02:06:02.570 --> 02:06:02.580 align:start position:0%
potential delays because if we get a
 
02:06:05.930 --> 02:06:05.940 align:start position:0%
motion to continue that trial
 
02:06:08.750 --> 02:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
three weeks four weeks before you know
 
02:06:10.729 --> 02:06:10.739 align:start position:0%
if we have two days set up for the for
 
02:06:13.010 --> 02:06:13.020 align:start position:0%
for a trial here yes we can fill it with
 
02:06:14.930 --> 02:06:14.940 align:start position:0%
stuff but it's not going to be somebody
 
02:06:16.490 --> 02:06:16.500 align:start position:0%
else's final order because that's
 
02:06:17.810 --> 02:06:17.820 align:start position:0%
already been scheduled because we
 
02:06:19.790 --> 02:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
scheduled it a long time ago and also
 
02:06:21.169 --> 02:06:21.179 align:start position:0%
parties are not necessarily going to be
 
02:06:22.910 --> 02:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
ready on that day and time when they
 
02:06:24.649 --> 02:06:24.659 align:start position:0%
already have another hearing scheduled
 
02:06:27.709 --> 02:06:27.719 align:start position:0%
so it is it is
 
02:06:27.719 --> 02:06:28.370 align:start position:0%
so it is it is
um

02:06:28.370 --> 02:06:28.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:31.430 --> 02:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
a potential where we are setting aside
 
02:06:33.649 --> 02:06:33.659 align:start position:0%
time that ultimately does not get used
 
02:06:36.169 --> 02:06:36.179 align:start position:0%
it's not being used as efficiently as as
 
02:06:38.870 --> 02:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
it can so I don't think simply saying
 
02:06:40.790 --> 02:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
that the parties have their Authority or
 
02:06:43.970 --> 02:06:43.980 align:start position:0%
the ability to see continuances uh
 
02:06:47.930 --> 02:06:47.940 align:start position:0%
really provides inefficiency and in fact
 
02:06:50.089 --> 02:06:50.099 align:start position:0%
you'll hear from some judges that
 
02:06:52.070 --> 02:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
motions to continue are really
 
02:06:54.410 --> 02:06:54.420 align:start position:0%
discouraged because again we're talking
 
02:06:57.050 --> 02:06:57.060 align:start position:0%
about a very valuable asset in the
 
02:06:59.270 --> 02:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
Court's docket and once we've scheduled
 
02:07:01.129 --> 02:07:01.139 align:start position:0%
something we want it to happen when it
 
02:07:02.810 --> 02:07:02.820 align:start position:0%
occurs because it can be very difficult
 
02:07:05.030 --> 02:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
to sort of backfill that space
 
02:07:07.370 --> 02:07:07.380 align:start position:0%
especially if there's not that much time
 
02:07:07.380 --> 02:07:08.770 align:start position:0%
especially if there's not that much time
available

02:07:08.770 --> 02:07:08.780 align:start position:0%
available
 
02:07:12.890 --> 02:07:12.900 align:start position:0%
so I think you know it does create some
 
02:07:17.030 --> 02:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:17.040 --> 02:07:18.649 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:07:18.649 --> 02:07:18.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:20.990 --> 02:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
if there is a specific issue as as was
 
02:07:23.689 --> 02:07:23.699 align:start position:0%
discussed with regard to alimony you
 
02:07:25.370 --> 02:07:25.380 align:start position:0%
know we didn't take a position on it if
 
02:07:27.050 --> 02:07:27.060 align:start position:0%
there are if there are specific issues
 
02:07:29.209 --> 02:07:29.219 align:start position:0%
that need to be addressed I think those
 
02:07:31.970 --> 02:07:31.980 align:start position:0%
can be addressed on on your sort of
 
02:07:34.550 --> 02:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
issue by issue basis but to sort of
 
02:07:38.030 --> 02:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
mandate on all cases and all time in all
 
02:07:40.910 --> 02:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
circumstances a final hearing be blocked
 
02:07:43.129 --> 02:07:43.139 align:start position:0%
off on the Court's calendar that
 
02:07:45.010 --> 02:07:45.020 align:start position:0%
blocking off creates
 
02:07:48.109 --> 02:07:48.119 align:start position:0%
a a significant number of scheduling
 
02:07:50.930 --> 02:07:50.940 align:start position:0%
problems what we do want to see is when
 
02:07:52.370 --> 02:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
the parties know what the issues are
 
02:07:55.070 --> 02:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
when those issues have been identified
 
02:07:57.290 --> 02:07:57.300 align:start position:0%
by the parties and we've been hopefully
 
02:07:59.689 --> 02:07:59.699 align:start position:0%
successful in narrowing those issues
 
02:08:02.450 --> 02:08:02.460 align:start position:0%
which is our ultimate goal
 
02:08:05.089 --> 02:08:05.099 align:start position:0%
um we can then set the the the final
 
02:08:06.709 --> 02:08:06.719 align:start position:0%
trial date we know how long it's going
 
02:08:08.689 --> 02:08:08.699 align:start position:0%
to take we know that we get a pretty
 
02:08:10.250 --> 02:08:10.260 align:start position:0%
good idea who the Witnesses are going to
 
02:08:10.260 --> 02:08:11.270 align:start position:0%
good idea who the Witnesses are going to
be

02:08:11.270 --> 02:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:08:14.330 --> 02:08:14.340 align:start position:0%
um and and ultimately the parties
 
02:08:16.370 --> 02:08:16.380 align:start position:0%
um really do have a better sense of of
 
02:08:18.050 --> 02:08:18.060 align:start position:0%
what they need to do and when they can
 
02:08:19.550 --> 02:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
do it by
 
02:08:21.470 --> 02:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
um and and that's how we do schedule
 
02:08:21.480 --> 02:08:22.729 align:start position:0%
um and and that's how we do schedule
things

02:08:22.729 --> 02:08:22.739 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:08:24.410 --> 02:08:24.420 align:start position:0%
um with that
 
02:08:26.089 --> 02:08:26.099 align:start position:0%
um I'll conclude my comments but I'd be
 
02:08:31.330 --> 02:08:31.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:35.149 --> 02:08:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:37.129 --> 02:08:37.139 align:start position:0%
where are we good morning Tony head
 
02:08:39.430 --> 02:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here sir uh
 
02:08:41.390 --> 02:08:41.400 align:start position:0%
specifically to go and what you just
 
02:08:43.129 --> 02:08:43.139 align:start position:0%
provided your guidance on
 
02:08:46.729 --> 02:08:46.739 align:start position:0%
if um and and with this the statement in
 
02:08:47.810 --> 02:08:47.820 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:08:50.089 --> 02:08:50.099 align:start position:0%
stating upon the issuance of temporary
 
02:08:51.830 --> 02:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
orders and then that timeline you
 
02:08:53.870 --> 02:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
implied was to know what what are the
 
02:08:56.870 --> 02:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
issues in dispute that's my word but in
 
02:08:59.470 --> 02:08:59.480 align:start position:0%
dispute is that once that is known
 
02:09:02.089 --> 02:09:02.099 align:start position:0%
uh would you
 
02:09:04.250 --> 02:09:04.260 align:start position:0%
consider to facilitate an orderly
 
02:09:07.189 --> 02:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
progression of resolution that a
 
02:09:09.050 --> 02:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
timeline as set by the judge knowing
 
02:09:11.089 --> 02:09:11.099 align:start position:0%
what the schedule is would be the final
 
02:09:13.970 --> 02:09:13.980 align:start position:0%
disposition shall be on this date
 
02:09:15.790 --> 02:09:15.800 align:start position:0%
and is that not an appropriate
 
02:09:19.370 --> 02:09:19.380 align:start position:0%
incentivization of completing the
 
02:09:22.970 --> 02:09:22.980 align:start position:0%
uh the proposal at hand so so thank you
 
02:09:24.950 --> 02:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
for the question a couple issues one is
 
02:09:26.450 --> 02:09:26.460 align:start position:0%
that as I mentioned at the time of
 
02:09:29.209 --> 02:09:29.219 align:start position:0%
temporary orders which essentially can
 
02:09:31.609 --> 02:09:31.619 align:start position:0%
be you know essentially shortly after
 
02:09:34.129 --> 02:09:34.139 align:start position:0%
the filing of the right petition
 
02:09:36.169 --> 02:09:36.179 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot of information but
 
02:09:38.629 --> 02:09:38.639 align:start position:0%
once we are scheduling something for a
 
02:09:41.810 --> 02:09:41.820 align:start position:0%
final hearing or final trial that's now
 
02:09:44.030 --> 02:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
blocked off on our calendar and sort of
 
02:09:46.189 --> 02:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
nobody else is touching that time
 
02:09:48.470 --> 02:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
at the time of the temporary orders we
 
02:09:50.209 --> 02:09:50.219 align:start position:0%
don't have information and enough
 
02:09:51.830 --> 02:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
information to
 
02:09:54.109 --> 02:09:54.119 align:start position:0%
to be able to establish how long do the
 
02:09:56.330 --> 02:09:56.340 align:start position:0%
parties need for for Discovery how long
 
02:09:58.669 --> 02:09:58.679 align:start position:0%
do the uh will the parties ultimately
 
02:10:01.370 --> 02:10:01.380 align:start position:0%
need in terms of trial time
 
02:10:05.330 --> 02:10:05.340 align:start position:0%
um and and it it really is not
 
02:10:07.550 --> 02:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate at that early stage to be
 
02:10:09.950 --> 02:10:09.960 align:start position:0%
able to set it what we do look for is we
 
02:10:09.960 --> 02:10:11.270 align:start position:0%
able to set it what we do look for is we
have

02:10:11.270 --> 02:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:10:11.280 --> 02:10:12.530 align:start position:0%
have
um

02:10:12.530 --> 02:10:12.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:15.109 --> 02:10:15.119 align:start position:0%
we have at the the initial sort of
 
02:10:17.649 --> 02:10:17.659 align:start position:0%
conference uh
 
02:10:20.570 --> 02:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
parties are are with some exemption
 
02:10:20.580 --> 02:10:22.189 align:start position:0%
parties are are with some exemption
exceptions

02:10:22.189 --> 02:10:22.199 align:start position:0%
exceptions
 
02:10:22.199 --> 02:10:22.910 align:start position:0%
exceptions
um

02:10:22.910 --> 02:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:25.250 --> 02:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
told to go into mediation we need to we
 
02:10:26.870 --> 02:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
work on trying to resolve these issues
 
02:10:29.810 --> 02:10:29.820 align:start position:0%
they're told to work with a court staff
 
02:10:33.890 --> 02:10:33.900 align:start position:0%
person to try to to identify what
 
02:10:35.870 --> 02:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
ultimately is at issue in in the trial
 
02:10:38.089 --> 02:10:38.099 align:start position:0%
and then they come back after they've
 
02:10:39.890 --> 02:10:39.900 align:start position:0%
had the opportunity to exchange the
 
02:10:42.470 --> 02:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
documents to try to mediate to work with
 
02:10:45.109 --> 02:10:45.119 align:start position:0%
court staff to reduce and identify the
 
02:10:47.270 --> 02:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
issues then they'll come back to the
 
02:10:50.930 --> 02:10:50.940 align:start position:0%
judge and uh at a at a pre-trial or a
 
02:10:53.209 --> 02:10:53.219 align:start position:0%
scheduling conference when those things
 
02:10:56.209 --> 02:10:56.219 align:start position:0%
are are resolved and identified and at
 
02:10:59.209 --> 02:10:59.219 align:start position:0%
that point the trial is scheduled and
 
02:11:00.649 --> 02:11:00.659 align:start position:0%
depending on the Court's docket whether
 
02:11:03.050 --> 02:11:03.060 align:start position:0%
it be three four months from then or two
 
02:11:04.729 --> 02:11:04.739 align:start position:0%
months you know it just depends on what
 
02:11:06.370 --> 02:11:06.380 align:start position:0%
is available at that time
 
02:11:09.649 --> 02:11:09.659 align:start position:0%
but there is a process we do try to
 
02:11:11.990 --> 02:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
resolve these cases within a year if
 
02:11:13.609 --> 02:11:13.619 align:start position:0%
there are no parenting issues they're
 
02:11:15.770 --> 02:11:15.780 align:start position:0%
generally we're in we're at around 92
 
02:11:18.830 --> 02:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
percent if there are parenting issues in
 
02:11:21.950 --> 02:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
the low 80 percent uh in terms of being
 
02:11:24.890 --> 02:11:24.900 align:start position:0%
able to to have these cases hit their
 
02:11:27.290 --> 02:11:27.300 align:start position:0%
final hearing within a year doesn't mean
 
02:11:28.790 --> 02:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
they all do it doesn't mean we can't
 
02:11:31.490 --> 02:11:31.500 align:start position:0%
sort of do better what I think really
 
02:11:35.030 --> 02:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
what is is Paramount is is getting some
 
02:11:37.250 --> 02:11:37.260 align:start position:0%
more resources into the court so we have
 
02:11:40.310 --> 02:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
more staff more judges available so then
 
02:11:43.129 --> 02:11:43.139 align:start position:0%
we have more essentially docket times
 
02:11:43.139 --> 02:11:44.050 align:start position:0%
we have more essentially docket times
available

02:11:44.050 --> 02:11:44.060 align:start position:0%
available
 
02:11:47.330 --> 02:11:47.340 align:start position:0%
in order to fill more cases into our
 
02:11:47.340 --> 02:11:53.390 align:start position:0%
in order to fill more cases into our
dockets

02:11:53.390 --> 02:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:55.729 --> 02:11:55.739 align:start position:0%
seeing no more questions thank you
 
02:11:59.629 --> 02:11:59.639 align:start position:0%
attorney head and the chair calls rich
 
02:12:01.490 --> 02:12:01.500 align:start position:0%
or Rick
 
02:12:01.500 --> 02:12:03.350 align:start position:0%
or Rick
Clark

02:12:03.350 --> 02:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
Clark
 
02:12:03.360 --> 02:12:04.790 align:start position:0%
Clark
rich

02:12:04.790 --> 02:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
rich
 
02:12:09.370 --> 02:12:09.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:12.169 --> 02:12:12.179 align:start position:0%
all right the chair recognizes me oh
 
02:12:13.790 --> 02:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
wait a minute
 
02:12:17.450 --> 02:12:17.460 align:start position:0%
and it's a Rockingham 32 Portsmouth
 
02:12:17.460 --> 02:12:19.850 align:start position:0%
and it's a Rockingham 32 Portsmouth
right

02:12:19.850 --> 02:12:19.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:24.229 --> 02:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:27.350 --> 02:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
you may not only sit but engage your
 
02:12:27.360 --> 02:12:28.609 align:start position:0%
you may not only sit but engage your
microphone

02:12:28.609 --> 02:12:28.619 align:start position:0%
microphone
 
02:12:33.109 --> 02:12:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:34.970 --> 02:12:34.980 align:start position:0%
so my name is Rich Clark I've practiced
 
02:12:38.390 --> 02:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
law in uh in in Portsmouth and have
 
02:12:41.270 --> 02:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
practiced family law in most courts in
 
02:12:45.890 --> 02:12:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:48.350 --> 02:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
and I'm here today because I have a lot
 
02:12:51.410 --> 02:12:51.420 align:start position:0%
of clients friends family
 
02:12:53.270 --> 02:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
that tell me the horror stories about
 
02:12:55.129 --> 02:12:55.139 align:start position:0%
our New Hampshire family courts taking
 
02:12:58.609 --> 02:12:58.619 align:start position:0%
years and years and they go on and on
 
02:13:02.089 --> 02:13:02.099 align:start position:0%
and people are tired of it and we want
 
02:13:05.149 --> 02:13:05.159 align:start position:0%
closure to our divorces and
 
02:13:07.069 --> 02:13:07.079 align:start position:0%
that is why I'm here
 
02:13:11.450 --> 02:13:11.460 align:start position:0%
so the the temporary order hearing
 
02:13:14.270 --> 02:13:14.280 align:start position:0%
addresses two things IT addresses money
 
02:13:16.129 --> 02:13:16.139 align:start position:0%
and custody
 
02:13:18.169 --> 02:13:18.179 align:start position:0%
I can't think of much else that it
 
02:13:20.270 --> 02:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't follow in but those are the two
 
02:13:24.109 --> 02:13:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:26.149 --> 02:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
when I meet my clients in that first
 
02:13:26.159 --> 02:13:27.229 align:start position:0%
when I meet my clients in that first
hour

02:13:27.229 --> 02:13:27.239 align:start position:0%
hour
 
02:13:28.790 --> 02:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
no matter whether they have
 
02:13:31.550 --> 02:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
multi-million dollar businesses or
 
02:13:34.550 --> 02:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
whatever they're doing the size of their
 
02:13:36.770 --> 02:13:36.780 align:start position:0%
estate doesn't matter I know in an hour
 
02:13:38.390 --> 02:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
how to resolve the case
 
02:13:41.030 --> 02:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
in in the last three years I think every
 
02:13:43.310 --> 02:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
case I've resolved once the client comes
 
02:13:45.709 --> 02:13:45.719 align:start position:0%
to me within three within 65 days of
 
02:13:47.510 --> 02:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
meeting the client
 
02:13:51.350 --> 02:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
so the complexity of the case to me
 
02:13:53.209 --> 02:13:53.219 align:start position:0%
doesn't change by how much money
 
02:13:55.609 --> 02:13:55.619 align:start position:0%
somebody has
 
02:13:57.950 --> 02:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
those temporary orders
 
02:14:00.350 --> 02:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
they sound temporary in nature but
 
02:14:01.970 --> 02:14:01.980 align:start position:0%
they're not temporary those temporary
 
02:14:04.129 --> 02:14:04.139 align:start position:0%
orders stay in effect until the divorce
 
02:14:05.510 --> 02:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
is finalized
 
02:14:08.450 --> 02:14:08.460 align:start position:0%
the court is well aware of what will
 
02:14:10.370 --> 02:14:10.380 align:start position:0%
happen and they know the facts of the
 
02:14:12.290 --> 02:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
case and how complex or simple it is
 
02:14:14.510 --> 02:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
after the temporary order hearing
 
02:14:16.729 --> 02:14:16.739 align:start position:0%
because custody issues and money is
 
02:14:18.589 --> 02:14:18.599 align:start position:0%
addressed all of those things are
 
02:14:18.599 --> 02:14:20.629 align:start position:0%
addressed all of those things are
outlined

02:14:20.629 --> 02:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
outlined
 
02:14:23.510 --> 02:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
and quite often the court has already
 
02:14:25.729 --> 02:14:25.739 align:start position:0%
tried these facts so they'll adopt the
 
02:14:27.169 --> 02:14:27.179 align:start position:0%
temporary orders into their final
 
02:14:27.179 --> 02:14:31.790 align:start position:0%
temporary orders into their final
hearing

02:14:31.790 --> 02:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:34.010 --> 02:14:34.020 align:start position:0%
the time that it takes for New Hampshire
 
02:14:34.020 --> 02:14:35.930 align:start position:0%
the time that it takes for New Hampshire
divorces

02:14:35.930 --> 02:14:35.940 align:start position:0%
divorces
 
02:14:37.490 --> 02:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
some of these
 
02:14:39.169 --> 02:14:39.179 align:start position:0%
to go on and on for years it's
 
02:14:39.179 --> 02:14:41.750 align:start position:0%
to go on and on for years it's
unreasonable

02:14:41.750 --> 02:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
unreasonable
 
02:14:44.089 --> 02:14:44.099 align:start position:0%
myself including other attorneys other
 
02:14:46.310 --> 02:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
litigants have filed for scheduling
 
02:14:48.290 --> 02:14:48.300 align:start position:0%
conference just to get a final hearing
 
02:14:51.050 --> 02:14:51.060 align:start position:0%
date people want to get them done
 
02:14:53.629 --> 02:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
I filed them six months after the
 
02:14:56.330 --> 02:14:56.340 align:start position:0%
petition was filed the court will deny
 
02:14:58.669 --> 02:14:58.679 align:start position:0%
it we're only asking for a final hearing
 
02:15:00.290 --> 02:15:00.300 align:start position:0%
date because we want to get this past us
 
02:15:02.209 --> 02:15:02.219 align:start position:0%
we want the damage to stop and we wanted
 
02:15:03.709 --> 02:15:03.719 align:start position:0%
to move on
 
02:15:05.810 --> 02:15:05.820 align:start position:0%
others have filed them one year after
 
02:15:08.270 --> 02:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
their divorce was petitioned and the
 
02:15:10.430 --> 02:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
court will deny just getting a final
 
02:15:11.870 --> 02:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
hearing date
 
02:15:13.910 --> 02:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
it's outrageous and these are the things
 
02:15:16.490 --> 02:15:16.500 align:start position:0%
that need to change and I'll address the
 
02:15:19.370 --> 02:15:19.380 align:start position:0%
money issues of saying this is going to
 
02:15:21.350 --> 02:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
create a burden to our court I think
 
02:15:22.910 --> 02:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
that's wrong
 
02:15:25.490 --> 02:15:25.500 align:start position:0%
it's wrong because in the criminal court
 
02:15:27.530 --> 02:15:27.540 align:start position:0%
system in New Hampshire
 
02:15:29.270 --> 02:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
the court will automatically schedule
 
02:15:31.430 --> 02:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
many things including the final hearing
 
02:15:31.440 --> 02:15:32.750 align:start position:0%
many things including the final hearing
date

02:15:32.750 --> 02:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
date
 
02:15:35.870 --> 02:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
yes most of these I think 98 of them are
 
02:15:38.089 --> 02:15:38.099 align:start position:0%
put out and they're put out and the
 
02:15:41.330 --> 02:15:41.340 align:start position:0%
clerk simply removes that final hearing
 
02:15:41.340 --> 02:15:42.589 align:start position:0%
clerk simply removes that final hearing
date

02:15:42.589 --> 02:15:42.599 align:start position:0%
date
 
02:15:45.589 --> 02:15:45.599 align:start position:0%
and someone else takes that spot
 
02:15:47.750 --> 02:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
something else will always fill the spot
 
02:15:49.910 --> 02:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
and to say this is going to be wasted
 
02:15:52.490 --> 02:15:52.500 align:start position:0%
time I think that's wrong and I think we
 
02:15:54.109 --> 02:15:54.119 align:start position:0%
can look to our Criminal Courts because
 
02:15:55.729 --> 02:15:55.739 align:start position:0%
they automatically schedule those and
 
02:15:59.149 --> 02:15:59.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:02.689 --> 02:16:02.699 align:start position:0%
this bill simply requires
 
02:16:05.330 --> 02:16:05.340 align:start position:0%
the court to schedule a date
 
02:16:07.669 --> 02:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
the court can say this is a complex case
 
02:16:10.370 --> 02:16:10.380 align:start position:0%
we're going to schedule out in a year
 
02:16:12.229 --> 02:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
they could say it's this bill doesn't
 
02:16:14.450 --> 02:16:14.460 align:start position:0%
limit the time they could say we're
 
02:16:16.669 --> 02:16:16.679 align:start position:0%
going to schedule out in two years it's
 
02:16:19.609 --> 02:16:19.619 align:start position:0%
just giving us a date of when we know
 
02:16:24.410 --> 02:16:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:27.229 --> 02:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
the final hearing notice there was there
 
02:16:29.930 --> 02:16:29.940 align:start position:0%
was a question that one posed and that
 
02:16:32.509 --> 02:16:32.519 align:start position:0%
was about deadlines and Discovery the
 
02:16:35.629 --> 02:16:35.639 align:start position:0%
final hearing notice tells you what is
 
02:16:38.750 --> 02:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
due when it's to be sent so we're aware
 
02:16:40.910 --> 02:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
we are aware of the deadlines that's not
 
02:16:43.070 --> 02:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
an issue
 
02:16:44.870 --> 02:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
the continuance
 
02:16:46.790 --> 02:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
of the hearing date
 
02:16:48.709 --> 02:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
you know I had a I had a hearing once
 
02:16:50.270 --> 02:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
and my mother died
 
02:16:52.250 --> 02:16:52.260 align:start position:0%
and so I requested the court on an
 
02:16:54.049 --> 02:16:54.059 align:start position:0%
emergency basis to continue it and the
 
02:16:55.370 --> 02:16:55.380 align:start position:0%
court granted it
 
02:16:57.110 --> 02:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
the court is very reasonable when it
 
02:16:59.810 --> 02:16:59.820 align:start position:0%
comes to granting continuances but they
 
02:17:03.290 --> 02:17:03.300 align:start position:0%
have to be for just cause it can be
 
02:17:05.509 --> 02:17:05.519 align:start position:0%
a health reason whatever the reason is
 
02:17:08.089 --> 02:17:08.099 align:start position:0%
for continuance it's not something that
 
02:17:10.009 --> 02:17:10.019 align:start position:0%
should give you any concern because I
 
02:17:11.570 --> 02:17:11.580 align:start position:0%
find that the courts are very reasonable
 
02:17:14.469 --> 02:17:14.479 align:start position:0%
in how they deal with continuances
 
02:17:17.209 --> 02:17:17.219 align:start position:0%
to address the issue of the cost to the
 
02:17:17.219 --> 02:17:19.549 align:start position:0%
to address the issue of the cost to the
court

02:17:19.549 --> 02:17:19.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:21.589 --> 02:17:21.599 align:start position:0%
upon the temporary order hearing which
 
02:17:24.110 --> 02:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
is typically heard within four months
 
02:17:26.330 --> 02:17:26.340 align:start position:0%
and my guess is that they would schedule
 
02:17:28.790 --> 02:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
the final hearing a year after so that's
 
02:17:31.070 --> 02:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
a year and four months
 
02:17:34.009 --> 02:17:34.019 align:start position:0%
so to address the cost issue
 
02:17:36.410 --> 02:17:36.420 align:start position:0%
I can tell you from my experience that
 
02:17:38.209 --> 02:17:38.219 align:start position:0%
the time
 
02:17:40.730 --> 02:17:40.740 align:start position:0%
weight going between the temporary order
 
02:17:43.129 --> 02:17:43.139 align:start position:0%
hearing and the final hearing there are
 
02:17:45.349 --> 02:17:45.359 align:start position:0%
needless motions that are filed when
 
02:17:47.330 --> 02:17:47.340 align:start position:0%
these motions are filed objections are
 
02:17:47.340 --> 02:17:48.349 align:start position:0%
these motions are filed objections are
filed

02:17:48.349 --> 02:17:48.359 align:start position:0%
filed
 
02:17:51.349 --> 02:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
and then responses are filed and I can't
 
02:17:53.330 --> 02:17:53.340 align:start position:0%
tell you in a typical case how many
 
02:17:55.429 --> 02:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
hours are wasted of the Court's time and
 
02:17:57.349 --> 02:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
judicial resources because we don't
 
02:17:59.209 --> 02:17:59.219 align:start position:0%
schedule a final hearing
 
02:18:01.490 --> 02:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
if we simply simply schedule the final
 
02:18:05.570 --> 02:18:05.580 align:start position:0%
hearing the cost to the court staff to
 
02:18:10.610 --> 02:18:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:13.190 --> 02:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
if there is needed more time for a
 
02:18:15.290 --> 02:18:15.300 align:start position:0%
hearing a party can always request to
 
02:18:17.629 --> 02:18:17.639 align:start position:0%
schedule that you can do a motion to
 
02:18:19.849 --> 02:18:19.859 align:start position:0%
exceed time limits so you can request it
 
02:18:21.530 --> 02:18:21.540 align:start position:0%
to be an hour and a half or two hours
 
02:18:25.129 --> 02:18:25.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:27.709 --> 02:18:27.719 align:start position:0%
I'm here to represent the general public
 
02:18:29.629 --> 02:18:29.639 align:start position:0%
I'm not here to represent the New
 
02:18:31.790 --> 02:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire bar and what I can tell you is
 
02:18:35.330 --> 02:18:35.340 align:start position:0%
that in my opinion if this were done in
 
02:18:37.250 --> 02:18:37.260 align:start position:0%
these cases were expedited and a final
 
02:18:39.469 --> 02:18:39.479 align:start position:0%
hearing was scheduled it would lower the
 
02:18:41.750 --> 02:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
litigants attorneys fees that I'm
 
02:18:44.330 --> 02:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
certain of when a case is done they
 
02:18:47.030 --> 02:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
don't drag on and on and who it helps is
 
02:18:49.730 --> 02:18:49.740 align:start position:0%
it helps the litigants so that they're
 
02:18:51.709 --> 02:18:51.719 align:start position:0%
not charged because these cases
 
02:18:55.730 --> 02:18:55.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:59.209 --> 02:18:59.219 align:start position:0%
my clients have anxiety and stress when
 
02:19:02.209 --> 02:19:02.219 align:start position:0%
they're going through their divorces
 
02:19:04.310 --> 02:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
I'm still smoking cigarettes for my
 
02:19:06.950 --> 02:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
divorce two years ago and I can tell you
 
02:19:08.450 --> 02:19:08.460 align:start position:0%
that I went through a remarkable amount
 
02:19:10.490 --> 02:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
of stress because my case alone went on
 
02:19:14.990 --> 02:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
for years for years it's too long is
 
02:19:17.209 --> 02:19:17.219 align:start position:0%
that reasonable I can tell you it wasn't
 
02:19:19.610 --> 02:19:19.620 align:start position:0%
reasonable and I went through it and I
 
02:19:21.950 --> 02:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
see others go through it and it's not
 
02:19:21.960 --> 02:19:23.990 align:start position:0%
see others go through it and it's not
right

02:19:23.990 --> 02:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:19:27.230 --> 02:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
most importantly the damage is done to
 
02:19:29.389 --> 02:19:29.399 align:start position:0%
our minor children
 
02:19:32.030 --> 02:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
maybe you won't go through a divorce
 
02:19:34.250 --> 02:19:34.260 align:start position:0%
but maybe your kids will
 
02:19:36.709 --> 02:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
maybe your grandchildren will and who am
 
02:19:39.169 --> 02:19:39.179 align:start position:0%
I here to support mostly it's the minor
 
02:19:41.509 --> 02:19:41.519 align:start position:0%
children that go through a remarkable
 
02:19:44.509 --> 02:19:44.519 align:start position:0%
amount of trauma when these cases go on
 
02:19:46.070 --> 02:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
and on because they know their parents
 
02:19:48.290 --> 02:19:48.300 align:start position:0%
are fighting they can sense it at home
 
02:19:50.810 --> 02:19:50.820 align:start position:0%
and it's our courts that allow this to
 
02:19:53.210 --> 02:19:53.220 align:start position:0%
go on and on for years
 
02:19:55.190 --> 02:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
and what happens to the mental health of
 
02:19:57.290 --> 02:19:57.300 align:start position:0%
our children when these cases go on and
 
02:19:58.450 --> 02:19:58.460 align:start position:0%
on for years
 
02:20:01.969 --> 02:20:01.979 align:start position:0%
clinical studies they show that they
 
02:20:04.450 --> 02:20:04.460 align:start position:0%
become addicted to drugs and alcohol
 
02:20:07.550 --> 02:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
crime is more prevalent
 
02:20:10.130 --> 02:20:10.140 align:start position:0%
why do we need this to go on for years
 
02:20:13.610 --> 02:20:13.620 align:start position:0%
we're asking for a simple cause here and
 
02:20:15.349 --> 02:20:15.359 align:start position:0%
that's just to schedule it the court
 
02:20:17.150 --> 02:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
could even schedule it 10 years out if
 
02:20:19.010 --> 02:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
they want by the way this is written but
 
02:20:23.630 --> 02:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:27.950 --> 02:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
one in two marriages will end in divorce
 
02:20:30.830 --> 02:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
two of mine have
 
02:20:33.770 --> 02:20:33.780 align:start position:0%
so it happens to many people and the
 
02:20:35.750 --> 02:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
probability of it happening to us or
 
02:20:39.710 --> 02:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:44.630 --> 02:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:47.150 --> 02:20:47.160 align:start position:0%
to protect our children to limit the
 
02:20:49.309 --> 02:20:49.319 align:start position:0%
injuries the injury that and the trauma
 
02:20:51.110 --> 02:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
they will go through to help our
 
02:20:53.030 --> 02:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
litigants just seek resolution and
 
02:20:55.010 --> 02:20:55.020 align:start position:0%
finality at a reasonable time frame and
 
02:20:57.770 --> 02:20:57.780 align:start position:0%
that's all we're asking thank you
 
02:21:00.170 --> 02:21:00.180 align:start position:0%
attorney Clark would you take questions
 
02:21:04.429 --> 02:21:04.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:07.010 --> 02:21:07.020 align:start position:0%
representative Grossman
 
02:21:10.429 --> 02:21:10.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm just curious so
 
02:21:13.070 --> 02:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
when you mentioned
 
02:21:16.429 --> 02:21:16.439 align:start position:0%
people are getting denied requests for
 
02:21:18.610 --> 02:21:18.620 align:start position:0%
that final hearing
 
02:21:21.110 --> 02:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
are they given a reason
 
02:21:24.290 --> 02:21:24.300 align:start position:0%
are there reasons for those denials
 
02:21:26.929 --> 02:21:26.939 align:start position:0%
um to quote a few it says denied and
 
02:21:30.530 --> 02:21:30.540 align:start position:0%
that's the reason and to me in those
 
02:21:32.510 --> 02:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
cases that I was have been involved with
 
02:21:35.870 --> 02:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
there's no cause to deny them other than
 
02:21:38.870 --> 02:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
the court docket maybe I'm just assuming
 
02:21:40.429 --> 02:21:40.439 align:start position:0%
they're busy or they don't want to deal
 
02:21:41.330 --> 02:21:41.340 align:start position:0%
with it
 
02:21:43.849 --> 02:21:43.859 align:start position:0%
but to file those a year after the
 
02:21:46.250 --> 02:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
petition has been filed and for me to
 
02:21:48.770 --> 02:21:48.780 align:start position:0%
hear stories of those that are denied
 
02:21:52.550 --> 02:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
I just I that's why you can you can have
 
02:21:54.050 --> 02:21:54.060 align:start position:0%
a good judge
 
02:21:56.210 --> 02:21:56.220 align:start position:0%
that will make a good decision
 
02:21:58.010 --> 02:21:58.020 align:start position:0%
I hail from one of the best family
 
02:21:59.809 --> 02:21:59.819 align:start position:0%
courts in the state of New Hampshire and
 
02:22:01.130 --> 02:22:01.140 align:start position:0%
that support Smith but we have a great
 
02:22:04.010 --> 02:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
judge but if you trust the discretion of
 
02:22:06.170 --> 02:22:06.180 align:start position:0%
those judges that aren't some of them
 
02:22:09.290 --> 02:22:09.300 align:start position:0%
aren't competent in my opinion and this
 
02:22:12.290 --> 02:22:12.300 align:start position:0%
we need to create law so that we just
 
02:22:14.270 --> 02:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
get a final hearing because to deny them
 
02:22:17.270 --> 02:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
a year after that's unreasonable a year
 
02:22:19.250 --> 02:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
after the petition is filed
 
02:22:21.349 --> 02:22:21.359 align:start position:0%
knowing that we're going to get typical
 
02:22:23.750 --> 02:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
trial data year after that
 
02:22:25.969 --> 02:22:25.979 align:start position:0%
so that's what I'm trying to hopefully
 
02:22:25.979 --> 02:22:27.230 align:start position:0%
so that's what I'm trying to hopefully
prevent

02:22:27.230 --> 02:22:27.240 align:start position:0%
prevent
 
02:22:29.929 --> 02:22:29.939 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:22:32.090 --> 02:22:32.100 align:start position:0%
um and another question not related to
 
02:22:33.770 --> 02:22:33.780 align:start position:0%
that one but
 
02:22:36.230 --> 02:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
so are you finding that more emotions
 
02:22:39.110 --> 02:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
are being filed
 
02:22:43.250 --> 02:22:43.260 align:start position:0%
because that final hearing is not set so
 
02:22:45.830 --> 02:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
instead they're going back to court to
 
02:22:48.710 --> 02:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
try to make things but without question
 
02:22:52.070 --> 02:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
and and those those filings and motions
 
02:22:54.530 --> 02:22:54.540 align:start position:0%
and then objections and then responses
 
02:22:56.990 --> 02:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
and hearings often take longer than the
 
02:23:00.170 --> 02:23:00.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:03.170 --> 02:23:03.180 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else representative
 
02:23:03.180 --> 02:23:04.550 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else representative
Raymond

02:23:04.550 --> 02:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
Raymond
 
02:23:07.010 --> 02:23:07.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and um thank you
 
02:23:09.110 --> 02:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
attorney Clark for coming and speaking
 
02:23:11.990 --> 02:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
to us today so I have to apologize my
 
02:23:14.330 --> 02:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
experience is mostly with the dcyf end
 
02:23:17.270 --> 02:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
of things so my experience in court has
 
02:23:19.910 --> 02:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
been you you file a petition and then
 
02:23:19.920 --> 02:23:21.170 align:start position:0%
been you you file a petition and then
there's

02:23:21.170 --> 02:23:21.180 align:start position:0%
there's
 
02:23:23.210 --> 02:23:23.220 align:start position:0%
timelines like three months later you go
 
02:23:24.410 --> 02:23:24.420 align:start position:0%
to court and then three months after
 
02:23:25.730 --> 02:23:25.740 align:start position:0%
that you know you're going back to court
 
02:23:29.389 --> 02:23:29.399 align:start position:0%
again and again until a tpr so
 
02:23:31.790 --> 02:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
obviously divorce is very different from
 
02:23:34.610 --> 02:23:34.620 align:start position:0%
that are there any trigger points that
 
02:23:38.030 --> 02:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
bring uh where somebody involved in a
 
02:23:40.309 --> 02:23:40.319 align:start position:0%
divorce would know the upcoming they're
 
02:23:41.870 --> 02:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
going to be going back to court so that
 
02:23:43.910 --> 02:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
there's not or is it just like a lag
 
02:23:45.349 --> 02:23:45.359 align:start position:0%
like you get your temporary orders and
 
02:23:46.790 --> 02:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
then you just kind of like wait and
 
02:23:48.469 --> 02:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
Never Land until
 
02:23:50.270 --> 02:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
something happens it's the neverland
 
02:23:52.610 --> 02:23:52.620 align:start position:0%
okay absolutely
 
02:23:54.110 --> 02:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:23:56.870 --> 02:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bickford
 
02:23:58.910 --> 02:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:24:01.309 --> 02:24:01.319 align:start position:0%
um do you think this is because the
 
02:24:03.650 --> 02:24:03.660 align:start position:0%
court is now overloaded do we have more
 
02:24:06.290 --> 02:24:06.300 align:start position:0%
divorces going on now uh we don't have
 
02:24:08.090 --> 02:24:08.100 align:start position:0%
marital masses anymore did those get
 
02:24:10.490 --> 02:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
replaced is there a reason for this to
 
02:24:14.929 --> 02:24:14.939 align:start position:0%
go on uh an attorney had said that
 
02:24:17.389 --> 02:24:17.399 align:start position:0%
um um at this temporary level it's too
 
02:24:19.790 --> 02:24:19.800 align:start position:0%
early it's too premature that's when I
 
02:24:21.710 --> 02:24:21.720 align:start position:0%
get out of what he said and maybe
 
02:24:23.270 --> 02:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
there's another point where it should as
 
02:24:24.950 --> 02:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
I hear a trigger
 
02:24:27.230 --> 02:24:27.240 align:start position:0%
um so those those are my questions if
 
02:24:30.050 --> 02:24:30.060 align:start position:0%
you can help I've been practicing for 15
 
02:24:31.849 --> 02:24:31.859 align:start position:0%
years and this has been happening that
 
02:24:34.550 --> 02:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
long so the cases in New Hampshire
 
02:24:36.830 --> 02:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
family courts drag on and on it's not a
 
02:24:39.110 --> 02:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
recent problem this has been ongoing
 
02:24:41.630 --> 02:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
it's been long term
 
02:24:43.670 --> 02:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
and I think the complexity of the case
 
02:24:46.250 --> 02:24:46.260 align:start position:0%
issue is a very weak one was
 
02:24:48.710 --> 02:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
respectfully said this is just in my
 
02:24:51.349 --> 02:24:51.359 align:start position:0%
opinion of practicing because
 
02:24:53.690 --> 02:24:53.700 align:start position:0%
I can tell you in the first hour in
 
02:24:56.270 --> 02:24:56.280 align:start position:0%
meeting the client what the issues are
 
02:24:58.550 --> 02:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
how to resolve them and again it's
 
02:25:00.950 --> 02:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
always two things how do we split your
 
02:25:04.070 --> 02:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
assets in half typically and let's do a
 
02:25:05.750 --> 02:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
parenting plan and the parenting plan
 
02:25:07.490 --> 02:25:07.500 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire has compared to
 
02:25:09.110 --> 02:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts when I was practicing
 
02:25:12.770 --> 02:25:12.780 align:start position:0%
family law there are very often is it's
 
02:25:14.330 --> 02:25:14.340 align:start position:0%
nine pages
 
02:25:17.750 --> 02:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
it's done very well a layperson can look
 
02:25:19.429 --> 02:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
at the at the parenting plan that's half
 
02:25:22.190 --> 02:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
of the divorce very simple very well
 
02:25:24.290 --> 02:25:24.300 align:start position:0%
done you don't need an attorney for it
 
02:25:27.170 --> 02:25:27.180 align:start position:0%
our issues in that temporary order
 
02:25:29.870 --> 02:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
hearing they are fleshed out I already
 
02:25:30.950 --> 02:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
know what they are in the first hour
 
02:25:33.290 --> 02:25:33.300 align:start position:0%
meeting the client
 
02:25:35.330 --> 02:25:35.340 align:start position:0%
always and that's why I resolved I think
 
02:25:38.270 --> 02:25:38.280 align:start position:0%
every case I've done within 65 days of
 
02:25:39.710 --> 02:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
meeting the client
 
02:25:41.929 --> 02:25:41.939 align:start position:0%
completely because I already know in the
 
02:25:43.730 --> 02:25:43.740 align:start position:0%
first hour what I'm going to do
 
02:25:46.130 --> 02:25:46.140 align:start position:0%
and I can tell you if I know it I would
 
02:25:47.510 --> 02:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
think that the courts do because they're
 
02:25:49.250 --> 02:25:49.260 align:start position:0%
more intelligent than I am so they
 
02:25:50.809 --> 02:25:50.819 align:start position:0%
should be able to flush these issues out
 
02:25:50.819 --> 02:25:51.950 align:start position:0%
should be able to flush these issues out
quicker

02:25:51.950 --> 02:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
quicker
 
02:25:53.750 --> 02:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
thank you we can hear about parenting
 
02:25:56.809 --> 02:25:56.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:59.450 --> 02:25:59.460 align:start position:0%
I see no more questions and I have no
 
02:26:01.790 --> 02:26:01.800 align:start position:0%
more pink cards so thank you for coming
 
02:26:04.130 --> 02:26:04.140 align:start position:0%
counselor thank you and I will close the
 
02:26:08.929 --> 02:26:08.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:08.939 --> 02:26:33.050 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:26:33.050 --> 02:26:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:36.050 --> 02:26:36.060 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping it opening hearing on uh
 
02:26:40.309 --> 02:26:40.319 align:start position:0%
House Bill 438 FN and call Mr chairman
 
02:26:41.870 --> 02:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson
 
02:26:46.790 --> 02:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:51.670 --> 02:26:51.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman this bill simply
 
02:26:55.130 --> 02:26:55.140 align:start position:0%
wants to ensure
 
02:26:56.870 --> 02:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
that a youngster
 
02:26:58.730 --> 02:26:58.740 align:start position:0%
is represented
 
02:27:01.969 --> 02:27:01.979 align:start position:0%
with a friend companion when testifying
 
02:27:04.010 --> 02:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
or being deposed
 
02:27:05.809 --> 02:27:05.819 align:start position:0%
if you look at the bill you will see
 
02:27:05.819 --> 02:27:07.010 align:start position:0%
if you look at the bill you will see
that

02:27:07.010 --> 02:27:07.020 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:27:10.849 --> 02:27:10.859 align:start position:0%
there are Advocate employees who help
 
02:27:10.859 --> 02:27:12.349 align:start position:0%
there are Advocate employees who help
out

02:27:12.349 --> 02:27:12.359 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:27:14.330 --> 02:27:14.340 align:start position:0%
but that's not the same as having a
 
02:27:16.730 --> 02:27:16.740 align:start position:0%
buddy there
 
02:27:20.270 --> 02:27:20.280 align:start position:0%
we have come to learn the value of
 
02:27:23.510 --> 02:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
having companion animals
 
02:27:26.030 --> 02:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
they're very very important for numbers
 
02:27:27.650 --> 02:27:27.660 align:start position:0%
of people
 
02:27:29.750 --> 02:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
I think we can understand having a
 
02:27:31.910 --> 02:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
companion person
 
02:27:34.910 --> 02:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
when a child is scared because this
 
02:27:38.090 --> 02:27:38.100 align:start position:0%
child has to give testimony
 
02:27:43.190 --> 02:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
I'm in my 48th year of ordained Ministry
 
02:27:46.370 --> 02:27:46.380 align:start position:0%
and on many occasions I've been present
 
02:27:47.690 --> 02:27:47.700 align:start position:0%
in the back
 
02:27:49.910 --> 02:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
of a courtroom
 
02:27:53.690 --> 02:27:53.700 align:start position:0%
when a youngster had to give testimony
 
02:27:57.590 --> 02:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
in some cases I was the companion person
 
02:28:01.429 --> 02:28:01.439 align:start position:0%
that child wanted to be next to him or
 
02:28:01.439 --> 02:28:02.450 align:start position:0%
that child wanted to be next to him or
her

02:28:02.450 --> 02:28:02.460 align:start position:0%
her
 
02:28:04.429 --> 02:28:04.439 align:start position:0%
and I can tell you
 
02:28:06.830 --> 02:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
it's scary if you've ever been deposed
 
02:28:09.469 --> 02:28:09.479 align:start position:0%
if you've ever given testimony it's a
 
02:28:11.210 --> 02:28:11.220 align:start position:0%
scary thing
 
02:28:14.510 --> 02:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
imagine how scary it is for a child to
 
02:28:17.210 --> 02:28:17.220 align:start position:0%
have a friend next to you can alleviate
 
02:28:19.309 --> 02:28:19.319 align:start position:0%
some of the fear
 
02:28:23.330 --> 02:28:23.340 align:start position:0%
one question that one may
 
02:28:28.429 --> 02:28:28.439 align:start position:0%
consider is what if the child picks a
 
02:28:31.790 --> 02:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
bad egg and that person sitting next to
 
02:28:35.870 --> 02:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
the child is signaling to others who are
 
02:28:37.730 --> 02:28:37.740 align:start position:0%
giving testimony
 
02:28:40.250 --> 02:28:40.260 align:start position:0%
the judge has discretion to throw
 
02:28:44.090 --> 02:28:44.100 align:start position:0%
anybody out of court who's misbehaving
 
02:28:46.910 --> 02:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
so in the very unlikely event I think
 
02:28:49.010 --> 02:28:49.020 align:start position:0%
that there would be such a person
 
02:28:52.429 --> 02:28:52.439 align:start position:0%
wrongly chosen to be the friend I think
 
02:28:54.530 --> 02:28:54.540 align:start position:0%
the Judge could deal with that if the
 
02:28:56.750 --> 02:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
judge saw this was taking place
 
02:29:00.950 --> 02:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
so I encourage this committee to pass
 
02:29:03.050 --> 02:29:03.060 align:start position:0%
this bill and I'll be happy to take
 
02:29:03.060 --> 02:29:04.250 align:start position:0%
this bill and I'll be happy to take
questions

02:29:04.250 --> 02:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:29:05.690 --> 02:29:05.700 align:start position:0%
are there any questions representative
 
02:29:05.700 --> 02:29:08.270 align:start position:0%
are there any questions representative
disamoni

02:29:08.270 --> 02:29:08.280 align:start position:0%
disamoni
 
02:29:10.309 --> 02:29:10.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chair and thank you Mr
 
02:29:12.590 --> 02:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
chairman for taking my question
 
02:29:14.450 --> 02:29:14.460 align:start position:0%
um you're talking about children in your
 
02:29:16.490 --> 02:29:16.500 align:start position:0%
testimony and I don't see anywhere in
 
02:29:20.690 --> 02:29:20.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:26.270 --> 02:29:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:29.510 --> 02:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:32.270 --> 02:29:32.280 align:start position:0%
broaden it to anyone I did I because
 
02:29:34.190 --> 02:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
this is children and family law I got on
 
02:29:36.530 --> 02:29:36.540 align:start position:0%
that track in my mind I'm thinking they
 
02:29:38.870 --> 02:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
may particularly need a companion but
 
02:29:41.150 --> 02:29:41.160 align:start position:0%
you are quite right anyone could need a
 
02:29:43.790 --> 02:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
companion so thank you for improving my
 
02:29:43.800 --> 02:29:45.170 align:start position:0%
companion so thank you for improving my
testimony

02:29:45.170 --> 02:29:45.180 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:29:47.750 --> 02:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
no thank you for helping me to
 
02:29:51.230 --> 02:29:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:53.389 --> 02:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond
 
02:29:55.190 --> 02:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
02:29:55.200 --> 02:29:56.389 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
um

02:29:56.389 --> 02:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:58.730 --> 02:29:58.740 align:start position:0%
will there be any
 
02:30:03.610 --> 02:30:03.620 align:start position:0%
um restrictions on age of the individual
 
02:30:06.830 --> 02:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
that the child or victim chooses as
 
02:30:08.410 --> 02:30:08.420 align:start position:0%
their support person
 
02:30:08.420 --> 02:30:09.969 align:start position:0%
their support person
and

02:30:09.969 --> 02:30:09.979 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:30:12.530 --> 02:30:12.540 align:start position:0%
would like a support or therapeutic
 
02:30:16.450 --> 02:30:16.460 align:start position:0%
animal also be allowed under this bill
 
02:30:20.290 --> 02:30:20.300 align:start position:0%
I don't see any age restriction on this
 
02:30:24.050 --> 02:30:24.060 align:start position:0%
and I don't see the mention of an animal
 
02:30:25.790 --> 02:30:25.800 align:start position:0%
one way or the other that would fall
 
02:30:28.969 --> 02:30:28.979 align:start position:0%
under existing law where support animals
 
02:30:31.309 --> 02:30:31.319 align:start position:0%
may be mandated under various federal
 
02:30:34.130 --> 02:30:34.140 align:start position:0%
and state legislation
 
02:30:36.650 --> 02:30:36.660 align:start position:0%
one quick follow-up
 
02:30:38.770 --> 02:30:38.780 align:start position:0%
sure are you anticipating anticipating
 
02:30:38.780 --> 02:30:40.550 align:start position:0%
sure are you anticipating anticipating
any

02:30:40.550 --> 02:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
any
 
02:30:43.910 --> 02:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
um training or otherwise support for
 
02:30:46.010 --> 02:30:46.020 align:start position:0%
this support individual so that they
 
02:30:47.990 --> 02:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
understand what their role would be in
 
02:30:49.969 --> 02:30:49.979 align:start position:0%
the courtroom
 
02:30:53.210 --> 02:30:53.220 align:start position:0%
I wasn't but it sounds like a pretty
 
02:30:56.030 --> 02:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
good idea that if you're going to come
 
02:30:58.190 --> 02:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
to court to be that you should know how
 
02:30:59.809 --> 02:30:59.819 align:start position:0%
to behave
 
02:31:02.809 --> 02:31:02.819 align:start position:0%
um I managed to get to be age 73 before
 
02:31:06.110 --> 02:31:06.120 align:start position:0%
I was deposed and you'd think I'd know
 
02:31:08.570 --> 02:31:08.580 align:start position:0%
by now I've watched 21 years of Law and
 
02:31:13.929 --> 02:31:13.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:17.090 --> 02:31:17.100 align:start position:0%
but in point of fact I was given some
 
02:31:20.030 --> 02:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
instruction before the deposition and I
 
02:31:23.389 --> 02:31:23.399 align:start position:0%
would assume that anyone who came to
 
02:31:25.969 --> 02:31:25.979 align:start position:0%
testify would be given instruction by
 
02:31:28.429 --> 02:31:28.439 align:start position:0%
that person's lawyer
 
02:31:30.530 --> 02:31:30.540 align:start position:0%
and I would assume a companion would as
 
02:31:35.210 --> 02:31:35.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:38.990 --> 02:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:40.130 align:start position:0%
 
chairman

02:31:40.130 --> 02:31:40.140 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:31:43.610 --> 02:31:43.620 align:start position:0%
um so my question is related to Children
 
02:31:47.630 --> 02:31:47.640 align:start position:0%
versus adults I was a support person for
 
02:31:50.630 --> 02:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
someone in their domestic violence
 
02:31:50.640 --> 02:31:51.410 align:start position:0%
someone in their domestic violence
um

02:31:51.410 --> 02:31:51.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:51.420 --> 02:31:53.389 align:start position:0%
um
case

02:31:53.389 --> 02:31:53.399 align:start position:0%
case
 
02:31:55.790 --> 02:31:55.800 align:start position:0%
in which they asked the judge if I could
 
02:31:57.230 --> 02:31:57.240 align:start position:0%
be there
 
02:31:57.240 --> 02:31:58.910 align:start position:0%
be there
um

02:31:58.910 --> 02:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:58.920 --> 02:32:01.429 align:start position:0%
um
initially

02:32:01.429 --> 02:32:01.439 align:start position:0%
initially
 
02:32:04.309 --> 02:32:04.319 align:start position:0%
so for children
 
02:32:07.010 --> 02:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
absolutely however do you think it could
 
02:32:09.469 --> 02:32:09.479 align:start position:0%
potentially be contentious
 
02:32:12.530 --> 02:32:12.540 align:start position:0%
for those that are adults even though I
 
02:32:16.010 --> 02:32:16.020 align:start position:0%
believe it's a helpful thing to have in
 
02:32:18.170 --> 02:32:18.180 align:start position:0%
the court system I just wouldn't want
 
02:32:21.110 --> 02:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
this to become another contentious piece
 
02:32:24.650 --> 02:32:24.660 align:start position:0%
in a in a situation where there's
 
02:32:28.130 --> 02:32:28.140 align:start position:0%
domestic violence or control issues
 
02:32:30.650 --> 02:32:30.660 align:start position:0%
of having that person bring someone to
 
02:32:33.170 --> 02:32:33.180 align:start position:0%
court because it is this is applying to
 
02:32:37.010 --> 02:32:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:41.469 --> 02:32:41.479 align:start position:0%
again if it looks like somebody is
 
02:32:44.270 --> 02:32:44.280 align:start position:0%
signaling whether they're from the back
 
02:32:47.750 --> 02:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
or sitting past the bar
 
02:32:50.330 --> 02:32:50.340 align:start position:0%
or causing A disruption
 
02:32:52.910 --> 02:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
or clearly
 
02:32:52.920 --> 02:32:54.650 align:start position:0%
or clearly
is

02:32:54.650 --> 02:32:54.660 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:32:56.570 --> 02:32:56.580 align:start position:0%
um ganging up
 
02:32:58.429 --> 02:32:58.439 align:start position:0%
I'm sure the judge would take care of
 
02:32:59.990 --> 02:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
that because they already have when
 
02:33:01.670 --> 02:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
there's disruptive people behind the bar
 
02:33:03.830 --> 02:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
so I would assume that this would
 
02:33:03.840 --> 02:33:07.550 align:start position:0%
so I would assume that this would
continue

02:33:07.550 --> 02:33:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:09.889 --> 02:33:09.899 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Nelson
 
02:33:12.230 --> 02:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chairman and thank you
 
02:33:15.590 --> 02:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman for taking my question do we
 
02:33:16.969 --> 02:33:16.979 align:start position:0%
have President
 
02:33:18.889 --> 02:33:18.899 align:start position:0%
um in Criminal Court
 
02:33:22.670 --> 02:33:22.680 align:start position:0%
um are there any people who are
 
02:33:22.680 --> 02:33:23.330 align:start position:0%
um are there any people who are
um

02:33:23.330 --> 02:33:23.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:25.790 --> 02:33:25.800 align:start position:0%
campaign I'm sorry
 
02:33:29.330 --> 02:33:29.340 align:start position:0%
the correct terminology it would be a
 
02:33:31.490 --> 02:33:31.500 align:start position:0%
support person sorry about that
 
02:33:36.410 --> 02:33:36.420 align:start position:0%
um it are there um support people aloud
 
02:33:39.230 --> 02:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
in criminal court cases do you know I do
 
02:33:41.929 --> 02:33:41.939 align:start position:0%
not know that but I know that attorney
 
02:33:44.510 --> 02:33:44.520 align:start position:0%
had is turned in a pink card so he might
 
02:33:47.450 --> 02:33:47.460 align:start position:0%
be able to address that thank you I was
 
02:33:49.790 --> 02:33:49.800 align:start position:0%
a support person in a criminal case to
 
02:33:53.630 --> 02:33:53.640 align:start position:0%
someone in one state an adult in another
 
02:33:56.830 --> 02:33:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:00.530 --> 02:34:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:04.250 --> 02:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:16.790 --> 02:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:18.290 --> 02:34:18.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
02:34:19.670 --> 02:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Richard head I'm
 
02:34:21.290 --> 02:34:21.300 align:start position:0%
the government Affairs coordinator for
 
02:34:23.230 --> 02:34:23.240 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch
 
02:34:25.610 --> 02:34:25.620 align:start position:0%
I'm here to testify with some concerns
 
02:34:27.590 --> 02:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
about the bill as written
 
02:34:29.150 --> 02:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
um and I would be happy to work with the
 
02:34:31.130 --> 02:34:31.140 align:start position:0%
chairman and the uh or the sponsor and
 
02:34:33.469 --> 02:34:33.479 align:start position:0%
the and the committee if if changes are
 
02:34:33.479 --> 02:34:35.630 align:start position:0%
the and the committee if if changes are
appropriate

02:34:35.630 --> 02:34:35.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
02:34:37.969 --> 02:34:37.979 align:start position:0%
um the bill as written would allow any
 
02:34:41.030 --> 02:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
party uh in any family court proceeding
 
02:34:44.330 --> 02:34:44.340 align:start position:0%
on 173 B to be permitted a support
 
02:34:46.969 --> 02:34:46.979 align:start position:0%
person and
 
02:34:48.889 --> 02:34:48.899 align:start position:0%
um says explicitly such use of a support
 
02:34:50.870 --> 02:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
person shall not be denied by the
 
02:34:53.570 --> 02:34:53.580 align:start position:0%
presiding judge at least that language
 
02:34:55.969 --> 02:34:55.979 align:start position:0%
is written I think has the potential to
 
02:34:58.070 --> 02:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
create additional litigation and
 
02:34:59.870 --> 02:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
additional conflict
 
02:35:02.929 --> 02:35:02.939 align:start position:0%
um because Eve as the as the sponsor
 
02:35:05.510 --> 02:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
suggested the court tries to control the
 
02:35:07.250 --> 02:35:07.260 align:start position:0%
courtroom if there's disruptive behavior
 
02:35:12.050 --> 02:35:12.060 align:start position:0%
if there is an attempt to try to guide a
 
02:35:16.010 --> 02:35:16.020 align:start position:0%
witness in terms of their testimony
 
02:35:18.110 --> 02:35:18.120 align:start position:0%
I think you're going to see that
 
02:35:22.969 --> 02:35:22.979 align:start position:0%
language as as being used in
 
02:35:26.750 --> 02:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
in an effort to retain the position of
 
02:35:29.870 --> 02:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
um of of the support person I think the
 
02:35:31.849 --> 02:35:31.859 align:start position:0%
issue of domestic violence and control
 
02:35:34.250 --> 02:35:34.260 align:start position:0%
issues is a significant potential
 
02:35:36.650 --> 02:35:36.660 align:start position:0%
problem and again the bill as written
 
02:35:38.750 --> 02:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
says there so the judge has no
 
02:35:40.550 --> 02:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
discretion essentially in allowing that
 
02:35:44.450 --> 02:35:44.460 align:start position:0%
support person in if there are uh if
 
02:35:46.070 --> 02:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a potential for
 
02:35:49.370 --> 02:35:49.380 align:start position:0%
intimidation from the support person if
 
02:35:51.410 --> 02:35:51.420 align:start position:0%
the support person is not truly there to
 
02:35:55.790 --> 02:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
support but is there as a strategic move
 
02:35:59.030 --> 02:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
by a party we would not as the as the
 
02:36:01.190 --> 02:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
court necessarily be aware of that and
 
02:36:04.250 --> 02:36:04.260 align:start position:0%
again we would not have discretion
 
02:36:06.469 --> 02:36:06.479 align:start position:0%
um simply saying that a person person is
 
02:36:08.809 --> 02:36:08.819 align:start position:0%
a support person I think would trigger
 
02:36:10.429 --> 02:36:10.439 align:start position:0%
the statute we don't know anything about
 
02:36:11.450 --> 02:36:11.460 align:start position:0%
that person we don't know the
 
02:36:13.790 --> 02:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
relationship we don't know sort of how
 
02:36:15.349 --> 02:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
it is they're there to sport why they're
 
02:36:18.349 --> 02:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
there to support it simply says the
 
02:36:20.630 --> 02:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
court you must allow it I think the the
 
02:36:22.910 --> 02:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
potential for additional conflict
 
02:36:22.920 --> 02:36:24.130 align:start position:0%
potential for additional conflict
additional

02:36:24.130 --> 02:36:24.140 align:start position:0%
additional
 
02:36:27.110 --> 02:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
problems additional disruption and
 
02:36:29.630 --> 02:36:29.640 align:start position:0%
potential additional control issues is
 
02:36:31.910 --> 02:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
significant in the way that this bill is
 
02:36:34.370 --> 02:36:34.380 align:start position:0%
written one thing I I guess I would say
 
02:36:39.230 --> 02:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
though is is to the extent they're
 
02:36:41.510 --> 02:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
let me take a step back I think judges
 
02:36:44.450 --> 02:36:44.460 align:start position:0%
in general if there is a request to have
 
02:36:47.690 --> 02:36:47.700 align:start position:0%
a support person at the at Council table
 
02:36:49.910 --> 02:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
or at proceeding
 
02:36:51.889 --> 02:36:51.899 align:start position:0%
the court would at least listen to why
 
02:36:53.330 --> 02:36:53.340 align:start position:0%
it is that that's appropriate and how
 
02:36:55.130 --> 02:36:55.140 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate and how it would not
 
02:36:59.210 --> 02:36:59.220 align:start position:0%
interfere with the proceedings what
 
02:37:01.010 --> 02:37:01.020 align:start position:0%
um if there is a concern or if there's
 
02:37:04.190 --> 02:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
experience by judges saying you know we
 
02:37:05.750 --> 02:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
we can't allow you past the bar
 
02:37:07.730 --> 02:37:07.740 align:start position:0%
essentially the rail
 
02:37:09.650 --> 02:37:09.660 align:start position:0%
there would certainly be nothing wrong
 
02:37:12.050 --> 02:37:12.060 align:start position:0%
with legislation that says the court in
 
02:37:13.730 --> 02:37:13.740 align:start position:0%
its discretion
 
02:37:16.250 --> 02:37:16.260 align:start position:0%
um may allow a support person to sit
 
02:37:18.710 --> 02:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
with with the party you know once you
 
02:37:21.830 --> 02:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
allow and in fact mandate touching you
 
02:37:23.510 --> 02:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
can use touching as a way of signaling
 
02:37:26.570 --> 02:37:26.580 align:start position:0%
testimony you can use that as a way of
 
02:37:28.309 --> 02:37:28.319 align:start position:0%
signaling in a way that the judge may
 
02:37:31.190 --> 02:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
not even recognize as happening because
 
02:37:33.469 --> 02:37:33.479 align:start position:0%
it may not be visible I think there are
 
02:37:35.990 --> 02:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of variables that that this bill
 
02:37:39.050 --> 02:37:39.060 align:start position:0%
at least has written does not take into
 
02:37:41.990 --> 02:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
account and and just creates a absolute
 
02:37:45.410 --> 02:37:45.420 align:start position:0%
right of a party any party and an
 
02:37:47.809 --> 02:37:47.819 align:start position:0%
absolute sort of prohibition against the
 
02:37:52.550 --> 02:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
judge from from restricting that so all
 
02:37:54.590 --> 02:37:54.600 align:start position:0%
that said I'd be happy to work with the
 
02:37:56.450 --> 02:37:56.460 align:start position:0%
sponsor and the committee if if there is
 
02:37:57.650 --> 02:37:57.660 align:start position:0%
additional language or if there's
 
02:37:59.809 --> 02:37:59.819 align:start position:0%
another way of presenting this but I
 
02:38:02.270 --> 02:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
think as written it creates such
 
02:38:04.490 --> 02:38:04.500 align:start position:0%
significant barriers for the court to
 
02:38:07.790 --> 02:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
control the courtroom the proceeding and
 
02:38:10.190 --> 02:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
uh in the way in which the parties are
 
02:38:12.770 --> 02:38:12.780 align:start position:0%
interacting that we would not support it
 
02:38:14.990 --> 02:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
as written with that I conclude my
 
02:38:16.309 --> 02:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
comments but be happy to take any
 
02:38:16.319 --> 02:38:17.450 align:start position:0%
comments but be happy to take any
questions

02:38:17.450 --> 02:38:17.460 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:38:23.450 --> 02:38:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:27.190 --> 02:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:30.469 --> 02:38:30.479 align:start position:0%
in the first paragraph the preface
 
02:38:32.990 --> 02:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
the finding just says it talks about the
 
02:38:35.210 --> 02:38:35.220 align:start position:0%
uh what we call the coalition
 
02:38:35.220 --> 02:38:36.349 align:start position:0%
uh what we call the coalition
uh

02:38:36.349 --> 02:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:38:40.309 --> 02:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
being there for people and
 
02:38:43.730 --> 02:38:43.740 align:start position:0%
um so this is sort of looking back to
 
02:38:45.349 --> 02:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
them and say Well they're doing it so
 
02:38:46.969 --> 02:38:46.979 align:start position:0%
why can't we
 
02:38:48.469 --> 02:38:48.479 align:start position:0%
and I'm not
 
02:38:50.510 --> 02:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
sure to what extent they're allowed to
 
02:38:53.510 --> 02:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
do that is someone have to be actually a
 
02:38:56.510 --> 02:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
victim uh no not a victim but
 
02:38:58.730 --> 02:38:58.740 align:start position:0%
um proven that they've been a victim or
 
02:39:01.790 --> 02:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
do they make a claim that they are
 
02:39:01.800 --> 02:39:03.410 align:start position:0%
do they make a claim that they are
um

02:39:03.410 --> 02:39:03.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:05.570 --> 02:39:05.580 align:start position:0%
so I guess I would leave it to the the
 
02:39:07.190 --> 02:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
Coalition and the folks who were
 
02:39:09.530 --> 02:39:09.540 align:start position:0%
involved in in sort of matching people
 
02:39:13.849 --> 02:39:13.859 align:start position:0%
uh we would we would as a court upon the
 
02:39:15.650 --> 02:39:15.660 align:start position:0%
filing of a of a domestic violence
 
02:39:18.170 --> 02:39:18.180 align:start position:0%
petition give them resources
 
02:39:20.690 --> 02:39:20.700 align:start position:0%
um to contact and try to have The
 
02:39:20.700 --> 02:39:21.889 align:start position:0%
um to contact and try to have The
Advocates

02:39:21.889 --> 02:39:21.899 align:start position:0%
Advocates
 
02:39:24.349 --> 02:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
um assigned but in terms of the details
 
02:39:26.030 --> 02:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
I would leave it to the to the advocate
 
02:39:29.330 --> 02:39:29.340 align:start position:0%
groups to describe that process
 
02:39:31.849 --> 02:39:31.859 align:start position:0%
um sure no that's the answer I'm looking
 
02:39:34.070 --> 02:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
for there's a it just takes a filing it
 
02:39:36.530 --> 02:39:36.540 align:start position:0%
doesn't take a conviction or any finding
 
02:39:39.170 --> 02:39:39.180 align:start position:0%
it's just a filing right a referral from
 
02:39:41.450 --> 02:39:41.460 align:start position:0%
us is the filing what in terms of the
 
02:39:43.309 --> 02:39:43.319 align:start position:0%
the process beyond that I would not
 
02:39:46.610 --> 02:39:46.620 align:start position:0%
comment on it okay thank you
 
02:39:48.469 --> 02:39:48.479 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
02:39:50.690 --> 02:39:50.700 align:start position:0%
see you none thank you Mr head thank you
 
02:39:53.270 --> 02:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
very much I'll call uh
 
02:39:55.070 --> 02:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
Lynn Charlotte
 
02:40:10.630 --> 02:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:13.190 --> 02:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
hi all right good morning Mr chairman
 
02:40:15.469 --> 02:40:15.479 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is Lynn
 
02:40:16.670 --> 02:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
schillette and I'm the executive
 
02:40:18.170 --> 02:40:18.180 align:start position:0%
director of the New Hampshire Coalition
 
02:40:20.929 --> 02:40:20.939 align:start position:0%
against Domestic and Sexual Violence the
 
02:40:22.849 --> 02:40:22.859 align:start position:0%
Coalition is the umbrella Organization
 
02:40:25.190 --> 02:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
for 12 community-based crisis centers
 
02:40:26.330 --> 02:40:26.340 align:start position:0%
throughout the state of New Hampshire
 
02:40:28.610 --> 02:40:28.620 align:start position:0%
that provide free and confidential
 
02:40:30.469 --> 02:40:30.479 align:start position:0%
services to approximately fifteen
 
02:40:32.270 --> 02:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
thousand victims of sexual assault
 
02:40:34.550 --> 02:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
domestic violence and human trafficking
 
02:40:37.190 --> 02:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
every year
 
02:40:39.469 --> 02:40:39.479 align:start position:0%
I'm here to speak in opposition to House
 
02:40:42.230 --> 02:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
Bill 438 but also to suggest an
 
02:40:44.450 --> 02:40:44.460 align:start position:0%
alternate way that perhaps the sponsor's
 
02:40:47.270 --> 02:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
goal with this bill could be achieved we
 
02:40:49.010 --> 02:40:49.020 align:start position:0%
very much appreciate the intent of this
 
02:40:51.469 --> 02:40:51.479 align:start position:0%
legislation in ensuring that victims
 
02:40:53.450 --> 02:40:53.460 align:start position:0%
receive the support they need After
 
02:40:56.150 --> 02:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
experiencing abuse however there are two
 
02:40:58.309 --> 02:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
specific points we would like to address
 
02:41:00.889 --> 02:41:00.899 align:start position:0%
the first relates to the introduction of
 
02:41:02.570 --> 02:41:02.580 align:start position:0%
the bill should the committee move
 
02:41:04.130 --> 02:41:04.140 align:start position:0%
forward with this bill we would ask that
 
02:41:06.170 --> 02:41:06.180 align:start position:0%
you remove section one
 
02:41:09.410 --> 02:41:09.420 align:start position:0%
which references nhca dsv Advocate
 
02:41:11.690 --> 02:41:11.700 align:start position:0%
employees because it is not accurate the
 
02:41:13.550 --> 02:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
Coalition does not employ any Advocates
 
02:41:15.650 --> 02:41:15.660 align:start position:0%
who provide Direct Services to victims
 
02:41:18.469 --> 02:41:18.479 align:start position:0%
those crisis center Advocates are hired
 
02:41:21.170 --> 02:41:21.180 align:start position:0%
and trained and employed by the
 
02:41:22.910 --> 02:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
individual community-based crisis
 
02:41:24.710 --> 02:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
centers throughout the state and they
 
02:41:27.349 --> 02:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
provide critical life-saving services to
 
02:41:29.510 --> 02:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
victims including safety planning 24
 
02:41:32.210 --> 02:41:32.220 align:start position:0%
hours a day around the year
 
02:41:33.770 --> 02:41:33.780 align:start position:0%
to the point that was raised earlier
 
02:41:36.349 --> 02:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
Advocates receive extensive training in
 
02:41:38.330 --> 02:41:38.340 align:start position:0%
fact it's mandated by Statute that they
 
02:41:41.330 --> 02:41:41.340 align:start position:0%
receive a 30-hour training course and
 
02:41:43.550 --> 02:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
the content of that is very specifically
 
02:41:46.190 --> 02:41:46.200 align:start position:0%
dictated in that way those Advocates are
 
02:41:48.530 --> 02:41:48.540 align:start position:0%
able to help victims navigate the family
 
02:41:50.330 --> 02:41:50.340 align:start position:0%
court process
 
02:41:52.309 --> 02:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
the second concern I'd like to raise is
 
02:41:53.809 --> 02:41:53.819 align:start position:0%
I don't think the statute is the right
 
02:41:56.210 --> 02:41:56.220 align:start position:0%
place to address this issue there are
 
02:41:57.830 --> 02:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
protocols in place which have been in
 
02:41:59.809 --> 02:41:59.819 align:start position:0%
place for over 20 years in the state of
 
02:42:01.790 --> 02:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire through the family and
 
02:42:04.610 --> 02:42:04.620 align:start position:0%
District divisions of the Circuit Court
 
02:42:07.969 --> 02:42:07.979 align:start position:0%
to be used in domestic violence cases
 
02:42:10.309 --> 02:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
these protocols were developed with wide
 
02:42:12.469 --> 02:42:12.479 align:start position:0%
input from a multi-disciplinary group of
 
02:42:14.510 --> 02:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
professionals who are part of the court
 
02:42:17.030 --> 02:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
process in family law cases
 
02:42:19.550 --> 02:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
the protocols reflect best practices in
 
02:42:21.410 --> 02:42:21.420 align:start position:0%
the courtroom and they're regularly
 
02:42:23.270 --> 02:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
updated to ensure that they are in
 
02:42:25.190 --> 02:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
compliance with both state and federal
 
02:42:25.200 --> 02:42:26.330 align:start position:0%
compliance with both state and federal
law

02:42:26.330 --> 02:42:26.340 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:42:28.130 --> 02:42:28.140 align:start position:0%
moreover as the other Witnesses have
 
02:42:29.690 --> 02:42:29.700 align:start position:0%
referenced these protocols were
 
02:42:31.790 --> 02:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
intentionally designed with victim
 
02:42:34.730 --> 02:42:34.740 align:start position:0%
safety in mind unfortunately as we know
 
02:42:36.530 --> 02:42:36.540 align:start position:0%
one of the most dangerous times for
 
02:42:38.990 --> 02:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
victims is when they seek to leave an
 
02:42:41.389 --> 02:42:41.399 align:start position:0%
abusive relationship for that reason a
 
02:42:43.190 --> 02:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
trained Advocate is able to provide
 
02:42:46.429 --> 02:42:46.439 align:start position:0%
options and information and resources at
 
02:42:48.830 --> 02:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
this very risky time
 
02:42:51.050 --> 02:42:51.060 align:start position:0%
currently these protocols allow a victim
 
02:42:53.570 --> 02:42:53.580 align:start position:0%
of domestic violence to have a trained
 
02:42:55.790 --> 02:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
crisis center Advocate present with them
 
02:42:57.469 --> 02:42:57.479 align:start position:0%
during a protective order hearing
 
02:43:00.110 --> 02:43:00.120 align:start position:0%
however these Protocols are not in law
 
02:43:02.270 --> 02:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
and therefore Advocates don't currently
 
02:43:05.389 --> 02:43:05.399 align:start position:0%
have a statutory authority to attend a
 
02:43:07.250 --> 02:43:07.260 align:start position:0%
hearing with a victim and I'd like to
 
02:43:08.809 --> 02:43:08.819 align:start position:0%
share some specific language from the
 
02:43:12.170 --> 02:43:12.180 align:start position:0%
protocol the protocol set section 7-7
 
02:43:14.450 --> 02:43:14.460 align:start position:0%
provides that if the plaintiff is
 
02:43:16.849 --> 02:43:16.859 align:start position:0%
accompanied by an advocate The Advocate
 
02:43:19.190 --> 02:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
should be allowed at Council table and
 
02:43:21.770 --> 02:43:21.780 align:start position:0%
may be allowed limited participation in
 
02:43:23.450 --> 02:43:23.460 align:start position:0%
the proceedings at the request of the
 
02:43:25.010 --> 02:43:25.020 align:start position:0%
plaintiff so some of the questions
 
02:43:26.690 --> 02:43:26.700 align:start position:0%
you've been raising about the parameters
 
02:43:28.550 --> 02:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
of the role of that person are already
 
02:43:31.370 --> 02:43:31.380 align:start position:0%
defined in this protocol
 
02:43:33.830 --> 02:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
and even when Advocates are present in
 
02:43:35.870 --> 02:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
the courtroom the protocol has specific
 
02:43:37.910 --> 02:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
limitations when it comes to the scope
 
02:43:40.730 --> 02:43:40.740 align:start position:0%
of their role in working with the victim
 
02:43:42.349 --> 02:43:42.359 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned previously these
 
02:43:44.510 --> 02:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
Protocols are routinely updated and in
 
02:43:46.790 --> 02:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
fact are undergoing a revision right now
 
02:43:49.010 --> 02:43:49.020 align:start position:0%
so I would suggest to you that that
 
02:43:50.990 --> 02:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
revisionary process would be the
 
02:43:53.929 --> 02:43:53.939 align:start position:0%
appropriate place for a dialogue if the
 
02:43:55.910 --> 02:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
scope of a support person for a victim
 
02:43:57.710 --> 02:43:57.720 align:start position:0%
of domestic violence is going to change
 
02:43:59.809 --> 02:43:59.819 align:start position:0%
there's already a document it's being
 
02:44:01.849 --> 02:44:01.859 align:start position:0%
used by the courts Court Personnel
 
02:44:04.429 --> 02:44:04.439 align:start position:0%
judges crisis centers throughout the
 
02:44:04.439 --> 02:44:05.510 align:start position:0%
judges crisis centers throughout the
state

02:44:05.510 --> 02:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:44:07.190 --> 02:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
so in conclusion we would ask the
 
02:44:09.650 --> 02:44:09.660 align:start position:0%
committee to vote itl on this bill we
 
02:44:11.030 --> 02:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
agree with the Bill's sponsor that
 
02:44:12.590 --> 02:44:12.600 align:start position:0%
victims should be allowed to have
 
02:44:14.630 --> 02:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
critical support during protective order
 
02:44:16.670 --> 02:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
hearings however that Authority is
 
02:44:18.530 --> 02:44:18.540 align:start position:0%
granted by the court protocols and not
 
02:44:20.750 --> 02:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
in state law so thank you very much I'm
 
02:44:24.950 --> 02:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:27.410 --> 02:44:27.420 align:start position:0%
I have one if I may
 
02:44:27.420 --> 02:44:28.250 align:start position:0%
I have one if I may
um

02:44:28.250 --> 02:44:28.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:30.349 --> 02:44:30.359 align:start position:0%
be satisfied with a Carvel for domestic
 
02:44:34.969 --> 02:44:34.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:36.770 --> 02:44:36.780 align:start position:0%
are you uh thank you for the question
 
02:44:39.889 --> 02:44:39.899 align:start position:0%
representative anybody else could get a
 
02:44:42.650 --> 02:44:42.660 align:start position:0%
support person except for a domestic
 
02:44:43.969 --> 02:44:43.979 align:start position:0%
violence Victim Because that's already
 
02:44:45.469 --> 02:44:45.479 align:start position:0%
been worked out with the court system is
 
02:44:46.670 --> 02:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing
 
02:44:48.469 --> 02:44:48.479 align:start position:0%
it's I'd have to think through that a
 
02:44:49.849 --> 02:44:49.859 align:start position:0%
little it strikes me that would be hard
 
02:44:52.309 --> 02:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
to administer because this is talking
 
02:44:54.950 --> 02:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
about family law cases but also sexual
 
02:44:56.809 --> 02:44:56.819 align:start position:0%
assault victims have access to Advocates
 
02:44:58.550 --> 02:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
and trafficking victims I think we'd
 
02:44:59.690 --> 02:44:59.700 align:start position:0%
have to think through that it might be
 
02:45:00.889 --> 02:45:00.899 align:start position:0%
might take a little longer to answer
 
02:45:04.070 --> 02:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
that question okay thank you any further
 
02:45:06.050 --> 02:45:06.060 align:start position:0%
questions representative Bickford thank
 
02:45:08.210 --> 02:45:08.220 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
 
02:45:11.510 --> 02:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
um again at what level
 
02:45:13.670 --> 02:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
um does someone come in be called a
 
02:45:17.809 --> 02:45:17.819 align:start position:0%
victim it can it be just on a claim
 
02:45:19.370 --> 02:45:19.380 align:start position:0%
or it doesn't have to be a finding
 
02:45:21.110 --> 02:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
before they get that kind of support
 
02:45:22.730 --> 02:45:22.740 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I'm actually
 
02:45:24.590 --> 02:45:24.600 align:start position:0%
glad you brought it up again so there
 
02:45:26.450 --> 02:45:26.460 align:start position:0%
are a variety of ways that people reach
 
02:45:29.030 --> 02:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
crisis centers to seek support sometimes
 
02:45:30.650 --> 02:45:30.660 align:start position:0%
someone who was raped or battered just
 
02:45:32.330 --> 02:45:32.340 align:start position:0%
picks up the hotline or walks in the
 
02:45:34.550 --> 02:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
front door as attorney had said
 
02:45:36.050 --> 02:45:36.060 align:start position:0%
sometimes they show up at the courthouse
 
02:45:37.790 --> 02:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
and the referral is made by the court
 
02:45:40.130 --> 02:45:40.140 align:start position:0%
staff we also get referrals from a
 
02:45:41.630 --> 02:45:41.640 align:start position:0%
variety of other professionals law
 
02:45:43.910 --> 02:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement in particular but there's no
 
02:45:46.250 --> 02:45:46.260 align:start position:0%
factual showing that has to be made for
 
02:45:48.230 --> 02:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
someone to get help at a crisis center
 
02:45:50.150 --> 02:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
they just have to come in and say I need
 
02:45:50.160 --> 02:45:51.530 align:start position:0%
they just have to come in and say I need
help

02:45:51.530 --> 02:45:51.540 align:start position:0%
help
 
02:45:53.990 --> 02:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
so uh I'm not talking about a question
 
02:45:55.969 --> 02:45:55.979 align:start position:0%
I'm talking now about having someone in
 
02:45:57.230 --> 02:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
court with them in the family court is
 
02:45:58.969 --> 02:45:58.979 align:start position:0%
this bill is about well in this case
 
02:46:01.490 --> 02:46:01.500 align:start position:0%
they would be a party in the family law
 
02:46:03.530 --> 02:46:03.540 align:start position:0%
proceeding so yes the proceeding is
 
02:46:05.630 --> 02:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
going on it has not concluded they're
 
02:46:07.309 --> 02:46:07.319 align:start position:0%
not has not necessarily been a certain
 
02:46:09.710 --> 02:46:09.720 align:start position:0%
finding but my reading of the language
 
02:46:11.929 --> 02:46:11.939 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:46:14.510 --> 02:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
um that anyone in a family court
 
02:46:16.190 --> 02:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
proceeding an adult or a child would
 
02:46:18.290 --> 02:46:18.300 align:start position:0%
have the right to this if they wanted to
 
02:46:22.190 --> 02:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about your organization
 
02:46:25.429 --> 02:46:25.439 align:start position:0%
your the first paragraphs
 
02:46:28.190 --> 02:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
okay it does not require a finding
 
02:46:30.889 --> 02:46:30.899 align:start position:0%
before you get help from the Coalition
 
02:46:33.110 --> 02:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct in fact the vast
 
02:46:35.450 --> 02:46:35.460 align:start position:0%
majority of victims that we serve do not
 
02:46:37.010 --> 02:46:37.020 align:start position:0%
engage in the criminal legal system or
 
02:46:38.450 --> 02:46:38.460 align:start position:0%
the family system they're never in a
 
02:46:40.490 --> 02:46:40.500 align:start position:0%
courtroom at all
 
02:46:42.950 --> 02:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:46:45.050 --> 02:46:45.060 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
02:46:46.849 --> 02:46:46.859 align:start position:0%
see you none thank you thank you very
 
02:46:48.650 --> 02:46:48.660 align:start position:0%
much representative I'll leave copies of
 
02:46:52.910 --> 02:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:55.010 --> 02:46:55.020 align:start position:0%
a call up to the honorable uh Betty Gray
 
02:46:56.690 --> 02:46:56.700 align:start position:0%
Betty gay
 
02:46:56.700 --> 02:47:04.849 align:start position:0%
Betty gay
foreign

02:47:04.849 --> 02:47:04.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:07.010 --> 02:47:07.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:47:07.020 --> 02:47:08.090 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

02:47:08.090 --> 02:47:08.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:10.849 --> 02:47:10.859 align:start position:0%
in no particular order I will address
 
02:47:13.190 --> 02:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
many issues that have been brought up
 
02:47:15.950 --> 02:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
this is the second time to bring this
 
02:47:18.230 --> 02:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
proposed Bill up
 
02:47:21.429 --> 02:47:21.439 align:start position:0%
um so I've heard the arguments before
 
02:47:24.469 --> 02:47:24.479 align:start position:0%
I was a little puzzled as to that they
 
02:47:27.050 --> 02:47:27.060 align:start position:0%
thought this needed an FN
 
02:47:29.510 --> 02:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
because I don't think it costs the court
 
02:47:32.510 --> 02:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
anything to have someone stand with you
 
02:47:34.809 --> 02:47:34.819 align:start position:0%
when you testify
 
02:47:37.790 --> 02:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
other states that authorize a support
 
02:47:37.800 --> 02:47:39.370 align:start position:0%
other states that authorize a support
person

02:47:39.370 --> 02:47:39.380 align:start position:0%
person
 
02:47:42.410 --> 02:47:42.420 align:start position:0%
do clarify that that's what a support
 
02:47:45.429 --> 02:47:45.439 align:start position:0%
person does they don't do anything else
 
02:47:48.770 --> 02:47:48.780 align:start position:0%
they just stand there with them wherever
 
02:47:51.790 --> 02:47:51.800 align:start position:0%
the person who asks for the support
 
02:47:54.710 --> 02:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
request whether that's sitting where
 
02:47:56.809 --> 02:47:56.819 align:start position:0%
they can see them or whether it's
 
02:47:58.849 --> 02:47:58.859 align:start position:0%
standing right with them or whether it's
 
02:48:00.650 --> 02:48:00.660 align:start position:0%
touching them
 
02:48:04.910 --> 02:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
um one of the counselors in Salem had a
 
02:48:09.650 --> 02:48:09.660 align:start position:0%
client who had been severely beaten by a
 
02:48:13.250 --> 02:48:13.260 align:start position:0%
partner and she got brave enough to
 
02:48:15.889 --> 02:48:15.899 align:start position:0%
testify and bring charges
 
02:48:19.969 --> 02:48:19.979 align:start position:0%
but when she was faced face to face with
 
02:48:22.790 --> 02:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
this person who had assaulted her so
 
02:48:26.750 --> 02:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
seriously she was terrified so I think
 
02:48:29.929 --> 02:48:29.939 align:start position:0%
we would say that was PTSD
 
02:48:34.130 --> 02:48:34.140 align:start position:0%
in the courts by federal law
 
02:48:37.610 --> 02:48:37.620 align:start position:0%
apart a victim of PTSD can have a dog
 
02:48:39.770 --> 02:48:39.780 align:start position:0%
and we all know that that you don't just
 
02:48:42.290 --> 02:48:42.300 align:start position:0%
go get a dog you know that has to be
 
02:48:44.450 --> 02:48:44.460 align:start position:0%
prescribed and recognized that you
 
02:48:46.790 --> 02:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
deserve to get a dog and then you have
 
02:48:49.130 --> 02:48:49.140 align:start position:0%
to spend or get some people to help you
 
02:48:52.309 --> 02:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
spend a lot of money to get a dog
 
02:48:56.809 --> 02:48:56.819 align:start position:0%
so when a person is a victim of a crime
 
02:48:59.030 --> 02:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
whether it's personal nature or whether
 
02:49:02.809 --> 02:49:02.819 align:start position:0%
it's you know a stranger they can still
 
02:49:05.929 --> 02:49:05.939 align:start position:0%
have the same PTSD and that doesn't mean
 
02:49:08.750 --> 02:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
that they have time to recognize that
 
02:49:10.250 --> 02:49:10.260 align:start position:0%
they need a dog
 
02:49:12.889 --> 02:49:12.899 align:start position:0%
or they have the opportunity to get one
 
02:49:16.010 --> 02:49:16.020 align:start position:0%
probably hoping that they won't need
 
02:49:18.710 --> 02:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
this forever but court can come up
 
02:49:20.630 --> 02:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly and we've done our best
 
02:49:23.450 --> 02:49:23.460 align:start position:0%
to help victims be brave enough to press
 
02:49:23.460 --> 02:49:24.770 align:start position:0%
to help victims be brave enough to press
charges

02:49:24.770 --> 02:49:24.780 align:start position:0%
charges
 
02:49:27.950 --> 02:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
but when they get to court and suddenly
 
02:49:31.570 --> 02:49:31.580 align:start position:0%
their their gut instinct is to be
 
02:49:35.389 --> 02:49:35.399 align:start position:0%
scared to death to be in the presence of
 
02:49:38.450 --> 02:49:38.460 align:start position:0%
the attacker it's understandable and
 
02:49:41.690 --> 02:49:41.700 align:start position:0%
sadly one of the cases I know of even
 
02:49:43.730 --> 02:49:43.740 align:start position:0%
though they had all kind of proof
 
02:49:46.610 --> 02:49:46.620 align:start position:0%
against the representative you're a
 
02:49:49.690 --> 02:49:49.700 align:start position:0%
little off track I'm kind of losing well
 
02:49:53.570 --> 02:49:53.580 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to say is that let's see
 
02:49:56.210 --> 02:49:56.220 align:start position:0%
maybe I've wandered off on dogs
 
02:50:00.410 --> 02:50:00.420 align:start position:0%
the point is when a person is in court
 
02:50:03.889 --> 02:50:03.899 align:start position:0%
and scared very deeply frightened of the
 
02:50:05.570 --> 02:50:05.580 align:start position:0%
person that they're trying to testify
 
02:50:05.580 --> 02:50:06.950 align:start position:0%
person that they're trying to testify
against

02:50:06.950 --> 02:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
against
 
02:50:08.929 --> 02:50:08.939 align:start position:0%
they should have the same kind of
 
02:50:11.330 --> 02:50:11.340 align:start position:0%
support somebody who's been given a dog
 
02:50:13.309 --> 02:50:13.319 align:start position:0%
can have
 
02:50:15.290 --> 02:50:15.300 align:start position:0%
um and which is you know a federally
 
02:50:18.590 --> 02:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
allowed program in any place you can go
 
02:50:21.469 --> 02:50:21.479 align:start position:0%
in court that dog can go with you I
 
02:50:23.630 --> 02:50:23.640 align:start position:0%
verified that because last year one of
 
02:50:26.210 --> 02:50:26.220 align:start position:0%
the criticisms a level that made by a
 
02:50:28.670 --> 02:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
former judge no less was well we don't
 
02:50:31.610 --> 02:50:31.620 align:start position:0%
let dogs in the court either
 
02:50:36.110 --> 02:50:36.120 align:start position:0%
and I boy was he wrong
 
02:50:38.570 --> 02:50:38.580 align:start position:0%
um this law does not say that you have
 
02:50:42.110 --> 02:50:42.120 align:start position:0%
to prove that you are a victim that
 
02:50:43.610 --> 02:50:43.620 align:start position:0%
hasn't been proved yet you have to go
 
02:50:46.130 --> 02:50:46.140 align:start position:0%
through Court to prove that there was a
 
02:50:48.530 --> 02:50:48.540 align:start position:0%
victim and there was an attacker so you
 
02:50:51.170 --> 02:50:51.180 align:start position:0%
can't make that a criteria to get a
 
02:50:52.490 --> 02:50:52.500 align:start position:0%
support person because you haven't
 
02:50:55.610 --> 02:50:55.620 align:start position:0%
proven that it even happened yet
 
02:50:58.490 --> 02:50:58.500 align:start position:0%
uh and if you don't what happened in the
 
02:51:00.770 --> 02:51:00.780 align:start position:0%
case before that I referred to the
 
02:51:03.650 --> 02:51:03.660 align:start position:0%
person walks scot-free because the judge
 
02:51:08.270 --> 02:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
insisted that not only the the uh
 
02:51:11.150 --> 02:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
not only the evidence
 
02:51:14.150 --> 02:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
but the person he demanded that the
 
02:51:18.170 --> 02:51:18.180 align:start position:0%
victim testify and she just couldn't
 
02:51:18.180 --> 02:51:19.150 align:start position:0%
victim testify and she just couldn't
um

02:51:19.150 --> 02:51:19.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:20.889 --> 02:51:20.899 align:start position:0%
that is
 
02:51:23.210 --> 02:51:23.220 align:start position:0%
obviously the wording does need to be
 
02:51:25.790 --> 02:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
changed where it says that uh an
 
02:51:25.800 --> 02:51:27.290 align:start position:0%
changed where it says that uh an
advocate

02:51:27.290 --> 02:51:27.300 align:start position:0%
advocate
 
02:51:31.270 --> 02:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
an nhca dsv advocate would be the person
 
02:51:33.950 --> 02:51:33.960 align:start position:0%
I'm under the impression that all the
 
02:51:36.230 --> 02:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
crisis centers are linked together in
 
02:51:40.010 --> 02:51:40.020 align:start position:0%
members of the nhca dsv
 
02:51:40.020 --> 02:51:41.270 align:start position:0%
members of the nhca dsv
um

02:51:41.270 --> 02:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:45.650 --> 02:51:45.660 align:start position:0%
The Advocate is very valuable and in the
 
02:51:47.990 --> 02:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
case that I'm referring to the advocate
 
02:51:50.450 --> 02:51:50.460 align:start position:0%
was present and had been very helpful
 
02:51:53.690 --> 02:51:53.700 align:start position:0%
but there is no way an advocate that
 
02:51:54.710 --> 02:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
you've met
 
02:51:58.750 --> 02:51:58.760 align:start position:0%
to help you is the same as a deeply
 
02:52:02.990 --> 02:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
strongly related person that is an
 
02:52:05.150 --> 02:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
emotional support for you
 
02:52:07.550 --> 02:52:07.560 align:start position:0%
so we're not advocating against
 
02:52:10.130 --> 02:52:10.140 align:start position:0%
Advocates we're just saying they can't
 
02:52:13.849 --> 02:52:13.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:13.859 --> 02:52:15.010 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:52:15.010 --> 02:52:15.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:17.269 --> 02:52:17.279 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
02:52:23.090 --> 02:52:23.100 align:start position:0%
I do have a handout that shows you know
 
02:52:27.290 --> 02:52:27.300 align:start position:0%
the proof that the proof that uh support
 
02:52:31.010 --> 02:52:31.020 align:start position:0%
animals are guaranteed
 
02:52:34.190 --> 02:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
access and I think that people deserve
 
02:52:40.849 --> 02:52:40.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:42.710 --> 02:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:52:45.769 --> 02:52:45.779 align:start position:0%
any questions uh representative Nelson
 
02:52:48.110 --> 02:52:48.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chair and thank you
 
02:52:51.110 --> 02:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
honorable gay for taking my question I'm
 
02:52:53.450 --> 02:52:53.460 align:start position:0%
a little confused because it seems to me
 
02:52:56.510 --> 02:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
that the example that you're giving is a
 
02:53:03.889 --> 02:53:03.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:05.510 --> 02:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
may you address
 
02:53:09.290 --> 02:53:09.300 align:start position:0%
uh well sadly the the lines get blurred
 
02:53:12.230 --> 02:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
in family court so there can be some
 
02:53:14.590 --> 02:53:14.600 align:start position:0%
real criminal activities
 
02:53:21.769 --> 02:53:21.779 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:25.070 --> 02:53:25.080 align:start position:0%
thank you oh you're good any further
 
02:53:25.080 --> 02:53:26.210 align:start position:0%
thank you oh you're good any further
questions

02:53:26.210 --> 02:53:26.220 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:53:28.429 --> 02:53:28.439 align:start position:0%
see you none thank you for your
 
02:53:31.670 --> 02:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you uh see no more cards
 
02:53:38.510 --> 02:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:40.969 --> 02:53:40.979 align:start position:0%
to be back here at one
 
02:53:55.969 --> 02:53:55.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:59.510 --> 02:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
yeah no this was for uh this was uh yeah
 
02:53:59.520 --> 02:54:13.429 align:start position:0%
yeah no this was for uh this was uh yeah
bitties

02:54:13.429 --> 02:54:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:13.439 --> 02:54:28.429 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:54:28.429 --> 02:54:28.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:31.969 --> 02:54:31.979 align:start position:0%
never ever again say this is just a very
 
03:35:29.269 --> 03:35:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:32.630 --> 03:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
any oversight by a judge to make that
 
03:35:32.640 --> 03:35:33.950 align:start position:0%
any oversight by a judge to make that
determination

03:35:33.950 --> 03:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
determination
 
03:35:36.290 --> 03:35:36.300 align:start position:0%
but for the rest of the time
 
03:35:38.570 --> 03:35:38.580 align:start position:0%
whether it's Harmony Montgomery's mom or
 
03:35:39.950 --> 03:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
somebody else who's asking for
 
03:35:42.290 --> 03:35:42.300 align:start position:0%
information from the Department the
 
03:35:43.849 --> 03:35:43.859 align:start position:0%
department shouldn't be able to squash
 
03:35:46.309 --> 03:35:46.319 align:start position:0%
what records are being requested
 
03:35:50.510 --> 03:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
and in one in section 170-g colon 8-a
 
03:35:52.309 --> 03:35:52.319 align:start position:0%
right which is has to do with
 
03:35:54.530 --> 03:35:54.540 align:start position:0%
confidential records by the department
 
03:35:56.630 --> 03:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
the commissioner is granted Authority in
 
03:35:59.210 --> 03:35:59.220 align:start position:0%
three places to deal with this right and
 
03:36:01.429 --> 03:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
the and the third section is rules so
 
03:36:03.290 --> 03:36:03.300 align:start position:0%
this addresses the two sections where
 
03:36:06.349 --> 03:36:06.359 align:start position:0%
the commissioner can just arbitrarily
 
03:36:10.670 --> 03:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:12.349 --> 03:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
we're seeing a growing number of cases
 
03:36:14.690 --> 03:36:14.700 align:start position:0%
where children right
 
03:36:14.700 --> 03:36:16.070 align:start position:0%
where children right
um

03:36:16.070 --> 03:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:18.349 --> 03:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
may have been abused
 
03:36:21.010 --> 03:36:21.020 align:start position:0%
um or are being abused either way right
 
03:36:23.809 --> 03:36:23.819 align:start position:0%
and a parent's trying to find out what's
 
03:36:25.790 --> 03:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
going on whether it's a contentious
 
03:36:28.429 --> 03:36:28.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:30.830 --> 03:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
whether it's a separation that already
 
03:36:32.870 --> 03:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
happened and one parent wants to know
 
03:36:34.190 --> 03:36:34.200 align:start position:0%
what's going on
 
03:36:35.809 --> 03:36:35.819 align:start position:0%
the Department's not sharing the
 
03:36:38.030 --> 03:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
information and that's the root cause
 
03:36:40.010 --> 03:36:40.020 align:start position:0%
that needs to be solved in no other
 
03:36:43.309 --> 03:36:43.319 align:start position:0%
place do we have effectively to use the
 
03:36:45.650 --> 03:36:45.660 align:start position:0%
vernacular right the the fox guarding
 
03:36:47.809 --> 03:36:47.819 align:start position:0%
the hen house the information is there
 
03:36:50.570 --> 03:36:50.580 align:start position:0%
the department creates the information
 
03:36:52.190 --> 03:36:52.200 align:start position:0%
but the commissioner can turn around and
 
03:36:53.809 --> 03:36:53.819 align:start position:0%
say this information that we found we're
 
03:36:56.290 --> 03:36:56.300 align:start position:0%
not going to share so this would open up
 
03:36:58.670 --> 03:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
that making sure that there's an
 
03:37:00.830 --> 03:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
independent oversight committee or in
 
03:37:03.130 --> 03:37:03.140 align:start position:0%
this case the judicial branch over
 
03:37:06.710 --> 03:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
overseeing the record sharing and then
 
03:37:08.570 --> 03:37:08.580 align:start position:0%
would allow the commissioner sorry the
 
03:37:10.849 --> 03:37:10.859 align:start position:0%
department to share the information in a
 
03:37:13.190 --> 03:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
timely manner
 
03:37:15.950 --> 03:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
that's it for the bill the need if
 
03:37:17.150 --> 03:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
there's any questions please give me
 
03:37:19.910 --> 03:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
please I'm willing to take them right
 
03:37:19.920 --> 03:37:22.610 align:start position:0%
please I'm willing to take them right
now

03:37:22.610 --> 03:37:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:24.650 --> 03:37:24.660 align:start position:0%
any questions for the representative
 
03:37:27.830 --> 03:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond uh thank you um
 
03:37:30.889 --> 03:37:30.899 align:start position:0%
chairman and uh thank you honorable
 
03:37:34.670 --> 03:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:36.889 --> 03:37:36.899 align:start position:0%
um the process is that a parent writes
 
03:37:38.870 --> 03:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
to the division of children youth and
 
03:37:40.550 --> 03:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
families and requests a copy of the
 
03:37:43.070 --> 03:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
record but they have to wait until the
 
03:37:44.809 --> 03:37:44.819 align:start position:0%
case is closed like that there's some
 
03:37:46.309 --> 03:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
outcome to it they're not getting in
 
03:37:49.670 --> 03:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
progress in progress notes is that
 
03:37:52.190 --> 03:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
correct so the parent does in fact have
 
03:37:54.170 --> 03:37:54.180 align:start position:0%
to request the records I don't know
 
03:37:56.690 --> 03:37:56.700 align:start position:0%
whether there's rules about disclosure
 
03:38:00.050 --> 03:38:00.060 align:start position:0%
during some court level thing
 
03:38:00.060 --> 03:38:02.570 align:start position:0%
during some court level thing
um

03:38:02.570 --> 03:38:02.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:06.530 --> 03:38:06.540 align:start position:0%
for the record right I had a I was
 
03:38:09.590 --> 03:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
our family actually was accused um by
 
03:38:12.590 --> 03:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
dcyf of neglect the judge ultimately
 
03:38:14.450 --> 03:38:14.460 align:start position:0%
found that we were very good loving
 
03:38:16.490 --> 03:38:16.500 align:start position:0%
parents and there was no evidence of any
 
03:38:16.500 --> 03:38:17.750 align:start position:0%
parents and there was no evidence of any
type

03:38:17.750 --> 03:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
type
 
03:38:20.809 --> 03:38:20.819 align:start position:0%
um of any neglect of our of our family
 
03:38:23.030 --> 03:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
but it took a fair amount of time to go
 
03:38:24.650 --> 03:38:24.660 align:start position:0%
through the court to get the records as
 
03:38:26.690 --> 03:38:26.700 align:start position:0%
opposed to going directly to dcyf I
 
03:38:28.790 --> 03:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
couldn't request the records to dcyf I
 
03:38:30.229 --> 03:38:30.239 align:start position:0%
ended up having to go through their
 
03:38:32.630 --> 03:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
legal team to get the records right on
 
03:38:35.210 --> 03:38:35.220 align:start position:0%
kind of as a Court Discovery but that
 
03:38:37.309 --> 03:38:37.319 align:start position:0%
was already into the process of the
 
03:38:39.469 --> 03:38:39.479 align:start position:0%
court so for that when you're in the
 
03:38:41.750 --> 03:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
court system there may be other rules
 
03:38:43.910 --> 03:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
about discovery on how records are
 
03:38:47.269 --> 03:38:47.279 align:start position:0%
shared but if we haven't gotten there
 
03:38:49.010 --> 03:38:49.020 align:start position:0%
why can't a parent have access to the
 
03:38:51.889 --> 03:38:51.899 align:start position:0%
records right let's say
 
03:38:54.110 --> 03:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
I'll use a hypothetical a child's in
 
03:38:54.120 --> 03:38:55.210 align:start position:0%
I'll use a hypothetical a child's in
school

03:38:55.210 --> 03:38:55.220 align:start position:0%
school
 
03:38:58.070 --> 03:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
comes home with a pretty nasty bruise
 
03:39:00.130 --> 03:39:00.140 align:start position:0%
parent wants to know what happened
 
03:39:02.510 --> 03:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
someone at the school makes a phone call
 
03:39:05.690 --> 03:39:05.700 align:start position:0%
to dcyf that child is now taken in for a
 
03:39:07.490 --> 03:39:07.500 align:start position:0%
medical examination where did this
 
03:39:09.650 --> 03:39:09.660 align:start position:0%
bruise come from right was this done at
 
03:39:11.450 --> 03:39:11.460 align:start position:0%
school was this done on sports or was
 
03:39:13.190 --> 03:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
this done at home type thing
 
03:39:15.110 --> 03:39:15.120 align:start position:0%
why can't the parent have access to
 
03:39:16.490 --> 03:39:16.500 align:start position:0%
those records why
 
03:39:17.809 --> 03:39:17.819 align:start position:0%
right we shouldn't allow the
 
03:39:19.670 --> 03:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner just to turn around and say
 
03:39:21.710 --> 03:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
no we're going to withhold sharing that
 
03:39:24.110 --> 03:39:24.120 align:start position:0%
information okay uh
 
03:39:28.729 --> 03:39:28.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:30.650 --> 03:39:30.660 align:start position:0%
very uh thoughtful of you to share that
 
03:39:32.090 --> 03:39:32.100 align:start position:0%
with us
 
03:39:35.389 --> 03:39:35.399 align:start position:0%
um in this particular case
 
03:39:38.929 --> 03:39:38.939 align:start position:0%
um you're asking that instead of writing
 
03:39:41.570 --> 03:39:41.580 align:start position:0%
to the local office and saying I would
 
03:39:43.969 --> 03:39:43.979 align:start position:0%
like a copy of my family's record with
 
03:39:47.210 --> 03:39:47.220 align:start position:0%
dcyf you would like that's still the
 
03:39:49.729 --> 03:39:49.739 align:start position:0%
process but then you want dcyf to have
 
03:39:51.969 --> 03:39:51.979 align:start position:0%
to demonstrate to a judge if they say no
 
03:39:54.229 --> 03:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
instead of the commissioner just saying
 
03:39:55.370 --> 03:39:55.380 align:start position:0%
no we're not going to share the
 
03:39:58.070 --> 03:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
information and we're aware of of cases
 
03:39:59.990 --> 03:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
where that has happened
 
03:40:02.030 --> 03:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
um the the commissioner would have to
 
03:40:05.450 --> 03:40:05.460 align:start position:0%
petition the court for the ability to to
 
03:40:07.550 --> 03:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
not share that information what's the
 
03:40:10.790 --> 03:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
recourse now if someone were to be
 
03:40:13.370 --> 03:40:13.380 align:start position:0%
denied access by the commissioner is
 
03:40:14.870 --> 03:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
there like do they go to the Ombudsman
 
03:40:16.910 --> 03:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
where do they go it's not real clear
 
03:40:19.429 --> 03:40:19.439 align:start position:0%
it's a great question thank you it's not
 
03:40:21.290 --> 03:40:21.300 align:start position:0%
real clear what happens when someone is
 
03:40:22.910 --> 03:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
denied information do they have to go to
 
03:40:25.729 --> 03:40:25.739 align:start position:0%
the court to get to order this right the
 
03:40:28.130 --> 03:40:28.140 align:start position:0%
process gets really muddy very quickly
 
03:40:29.990 --> 03:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
in no other case whether it's government
 
03:40:32.330 --> 03:40:32.340 align:start position:0%
creating records and then not sharing
 
03:40:34.910 --> 03:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
them okay where that same Department
 
03:40:36.469 --> 03:40:36.479 align:start position:0%
gets to say no we're not going to share
 
03:40:38.150 --> 03:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
them right typically it goes to the
 
03:40:40.070 --> 03:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
judicial branch for the sole purpose of
 
03:40:41.750 --> 03:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
being able to have an independent
 
03:40:43.790 --> 03:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
oversight whether this is information
 
03:40:46.190 --> 03:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
that could put the the child in further
 
03:40:48.170 --> 03:40:48.180 align:start position:0%
danger and that's the that should be the
 
03:40:49.910 --> 03:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
threshold right is this in the best
 
03:40:51.590 --> 03:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
interests of the child disclosing this
 
03:40:53.570 --> 03:40:53.580 align:start position:0%
information well the commissioner who
 
03:40:54.889 --> 03:40:54.899 align:start position:0%
has that information wouldn't
 
03:40:57.530 --> 03:40:57.540 align:start position:0%
necessarily be an unbiased person to
 
03:40:59.030 --> 03:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
make that claim
 
03:41:01.429 --> 03:41:01.439 align:start position:0%
the judge would
 
03:41:03.710 --> 03:41:03.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I appreciate it
 
03:41:06.349 --> 03:41:06.359 align:start position:0%
representative D Simone
 
03:41:10.849 --> 03:41:10.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:14.269 --> 03:41:14.279 align:start position:0%
sure I'm reading section one
 
03:41:19.190 --> 03:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:21.950 --> 03:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
parentheses open and close parentheses a
 
03:41:25.190 --> 03:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
the department shall provide access to
 
03:41:27.530 --> 03:41:27.540 align:start position:0%
the case records to the following
 
03:41:27.540 --> 03:41:29.630 align:start position:0%
the case records to the following
persons

03:41:29.630 --> 03:41:29.640 align:start position:0%
persons
 
03:41:34.250 --> 03:41:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:36.889 --> 03:41:36.899 align:start position:0%
petitions the court but there's no list
 
03:41:39.410 --> 03:41:39.420 align:start position:0%
of persons what persons okay so you
 
03:41:41.269 --> 03:41:41.279 align:start position:0%
would have to go back to the rest of
 
03:41:43.070 --> 03:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
that section of Statute there's a list
 
03:41:47.110 --> 03:41:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:51.830 --> 03:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
may I sug follow up yeah may I suggest
 
03:41:53.570 --> 03:41:53.580 align:start position:0%
that they'd be listed here as well
 
03:41:55.490 --> 03:41:55.500 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't seem like the thought
 
03:41:57.469 --> 03:41:57.479 align:start position:0%
was finished is my
 
03:41:57.479 --> 03:41:59.450 align:start position:0%
was finished is my
point

03:41:59.450 --> 03:41:59.460 align:start position:0%
point
 
03:41:59.460 --> 03:42:00.790 align:start position:0%
point
um

03:42:00.790 --> 03:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:04.969 --> 03:42:04.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:04.979 --> 03:42:06.490 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:42:06.490 --> 03:42:06.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:09.650 --> 03:42:09.660 align:start position:0%
there is a right the case records of the
 
03:42:11.690 --> 03:42:11.700 align:start position:0%
department shall be confidential
 
03:42:14.750 --> 03:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
um the record shall be available
 
03:42:16.910 --> 03:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
um to there's a list of people further
 
03:42:18.769 --> 03:42:18.779 align:start position:0%
down in this section and I want to find
 
03:42:20.150 --> 03:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
it right
 
03:42:22.250 --> 03:42:22.260 align:start position:0%
already laid out
 
03:42:24.830 --> 03:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
so this is not the complete section of
 
03:42:29.030 --> 03:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
170 g8-a right there there's it would be
 
03:42:32.030 --> 03:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
two pages worth of text this is just two
 
03:42:34.729 --> 03:42:34.739 align:start position:0%
sections of that text
 
03:42:36.830 --> 03:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
um I can ask that the committee
 
03:42:40.490 --> 03:42:40.500 align:start position:0%
researcher I can send it to you in
 
03:42:40.500 --> 03:42:42.469 align:start position:0%
researcher I can send it to you in
foreign

03:42:42.469 --> 03:42:42.479 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:42:46.130 --> 03:42:46.140 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry may I yeah go ahead I I can
 
03:42:49.849 --> 03:42:49.859 align:start position:0%
get that my thought is that
 
03:42:53.830 --> 03:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
the sentence just was not finished okay
 
03:42:58.070 --> 03:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
and that's my concern I I prefer it to
 
03:42:58.080 --> 03:42:58.969 align:start position:0%
and that's my concern I I prefer it to
be

03:42:58.969 --> 03:42:58.979 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:43:01.969 --> 03:43:01.979 align:start position:0%
more clear okay thank you thank you so
 
03:43:06.130 --> 03:43:06.140 align:start position:0%
under two parentheses a there is
 
03:43:09.410 --> 03:43:09.420 align:start position:0%
parentheses one through nine below that
 
03:43:12.229 --> 03:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
the child the parent the guardian the
 
03:43:13.910 --> 03:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
custody right another member of the
 
03:43:15.769 --> 03:43:15.779 align:start position:0%
family employees of the department legal
 
03:43:18.229 --> 03:43:18.239 align:start position:0%
counsel for dcyf there's a whole list of
 
03:43:20.870 --> 03:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
people that are part of Who records are
 
03:43:23.570 --> 03:43:23.580 align:start position:0%
disclosed to that's already past that
 
03:43:25.849 --> 03:43:25.859 align:start position:0%
colon so the colon is the end of this
 
03:43:27.889 --> 03:43:27.899 align:start position:0%
sentence but there's an entire list of
 
03:43:30.769 --> 03:43:30.779 align:start position:0%
people and in some cases organizations
 
03:43:32.750 --> 03:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
below that that have access to the
 
03:43:32.760 --> 03:43:35.750 align:start position:0%
below that that have access to the
records

03:43:35.750 --> 03:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:35.760 --> 03:43:41.690 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:43:41.690 --> 03:43:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:44.210 --> 03:43:44.220 align:start position:0%
let me read that from the book here the
 
03:43:46.190 --> 03:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
case records of the department shall be
 
03:43:49.670 --> 03:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
confidential sub a the department shall
 
03:43:52.190 --> 03:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
provide access to the case records to
 
03:43:54.710 --> 03:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
the following persons and parents are
 
03:43:58.490 --> 03:43:58.500 align:start position:0%
listed into Sub sub 2. unless the
 
03:44:01.190 --> 03:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner or designee determines that
 
03:44:02.990 --> 03:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
the harm to the child named in the case
 
03:44:06.010 --> 03:44:06.020 align:start position:0%
record resulting from the disclosure
 
03:44:08.990 --> 03:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
outweighs the need for the disclosure so
 
03:44:12.010 --> 03:44:12.020 align:start position:0%
if the commissioner or one assigned
 
03:44:14.750 --> 03:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
believes that releasing the records
 
03:44:17.030 --> 03:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
would harm the child they shall not be
 
03:44:19.010 --> 03:44:19.020 align:start position:0%
released that that's what we have that
 
03:44:20.990 --> 03:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
is currently today is that a status quo
 
03:44:21.000 --> 03:44:21.769 align:start position:0%
is currently today is that a status quo
here

03:44:21.769 --> 03:44:21.779 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:44:24.170 --> 03:44:24.180 align:start position:0%
so in this case we have the executive
 
03:44:28.250 --> 03:44:28.260 align:start position:0%
branch or right a supporting function of
 
03:44:30.170 --> 03:44:30.180 align:start position:0%
the executive branch who's us with
 
03:44:32.290 --> 03:44:32.300 align:start position:0%
administering the Justice side of things
 
03:44:35.150 --> 03:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
and and enacting and administering the
 
03:44:37.550 --> 03:44:37.560 align:start position:0%
policy who finds and produces the
 
03:44:40.550 --> 03:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
records the problem is they also get
 
03:44:42.110 --> 03:44:42.120 align:start position:0%
the say
 
03:44:43.670 --> 03:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
um whether they're released or not and
 
03:44:45.710 --> 03:44:45.720 align:start position:0%
normally the judicial process would kick
 
03:44:47.929 --> 03:44:47.939 align:start position:0%
in then about an independent oversight
 
03:44:49.610 --> 03:44:49.620 align:start position:0%
for record release
 
03:44:52.610 --> 03:44:52.620 align:start position:0%
so in other words
 
03:44:54.410 --> 03:44:54.420 align:start position:0%
if we say you're not going to get them
 
03:44:55.670 --> 03:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get them you would
 
03:44:58.550 --> 03:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
like that to be changed to if we want
 
03:45:00.650 --> 03:45:00.660 align:start position:0%
them we get them unless you prove
 
03:45:00.660 --> 03:45:01.910 align:start position:0%
them we get them unless you prove
otherwise

03:45:01.910 --> 03:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
03:45:04.190 --> 03:45:04.200 align:start position:0%
it's it's something let me reiterate
 
03:45:05.990 --> 03:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
that slightly differently okay
 
03:45:09.469 --> 03:45:09.479 align:start position:0%
if a if a parent or the child or the
 
03:45:11.330 --> 03:45:11.340 align:start position:0%
list of one through nine request the
 
03:45:14.150 --> 03:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
records the record shall be handed out
 
03:45:17.150 --> 03:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
if the commissioner doesn't me believes
 
03:45:19.729 --> 03:45:19.739 align:start position:0%
that these are in fact dangerous to the
 
03:45:22.190 --> 03:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
best interest of the child or to right
 
03:45:24.469 --> 03:45:24.479 align:start position:0%
could cause harm
 
03:45:27.290 --> 03:45:27.300 align:start position:0%
the child the the design sorry the
 
03:45:28.969 --> 03:45:28.979 align:start position:0%
commissioner designee can then say to
 
03:45:30.950 --> 03:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
the court I have a reason I have good
 
03:45:33.110 --> 03:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
evidence why these records should not go
 
03:45:36.050 --> 03:45:36.060 align:start position:0%
out right now and I would like a judge
 
03:45:38.450 --> 03:45:38.460 align:start position:0%
to confirm that and then the judge gets
 
03:45:40.130 --> 03:45:40.140 align:start position:0%
to look at that evidence independently
 
03:45:41.990 --> 03:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure that there could be no
 
03:45:45.710 --> 03:45:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:47.750 --> 03:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
got it
 
03:45:50.150 --> 03:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
representative Greg thank you Mr
 
03:45:51.710 --> 03:45:51.720 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for being here in
 
03:45:53.570 --> 03:45:53.580 align:start position:0%
your testimony today and for taking my
 
03:45:53.580 --> 03:45:54.650 align:start position:0%
your testimony today and for taking my
question

03:45:54.650 --> 03:45:54.660 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:45:56.750 --> 03:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
um I just the one question I have is
 
03:45:56.760 --> 03:45:57.889 align:start position:0%
um I just the one question I have is
what

03:45:57.889 --> 03:45:57.899 align:start position:0%
what
 
03:45:59.929 --> 03:45:59.939 align:start position:0%
um my brain just totally like stalled
 
03:46:01.370 --> 03:46:01.380 align:start position:0%
out on me
 
03:46:01.380 --> 03:46:05.110 align:start position:0%
out on me
um

03:46:05.110 --> 03:46:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:07.550 --> 03:46:07.560 align:start position:0%
what would be the reasoning that the
 
03:46:10.670 --> 03:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
parent if this is in a case like um
 
03:46:12.410 --> 03:46:12.420 align:start position:0%
in somebody's case where they're trying
 
03:46:14.330 --> 03:46:14.340 align:start position:0%
to either look and see if there is
 
03:46:17.150 --> 03:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
findings for abuse or not
 
03:46:19.250 --> 03:46:19.260 align:start position:0%
um what would be the reason that the
 
03:46:22.610 --> 03:46:22.620 align:start position:0%
parent would have to have uh this report
 
03:46:25.570 --> 03:46:25.580 align:start position:0%
before I mean seemingly the entire
 
03:46:28.610 --> 03:46:28.620 align:start position:0%
investigation is done so I'm going to
 
03:46:30.229 --> 03:46:30.239 align:start position:0%
use this
 
03:46:32.389 --> 03:46:32.399 align:start position:0%
since it was Front Page News the case
 
03:46:34.370 --> 03:46:34.380 align:start position:0%
study about Harmony Montgomery along the
 
03:46:36.710 --> 03:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
way right where the mom had numerous
 
03:46:38.809 --> 03:46:38.819 align:start position:0%
requests into the department for updates
 
03:46:40.670 --> 03:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
what's going on those that information
 
03:46:43.429 --> 03:46:43.439 align:start position:0%
wasn't being shared this went on for a
 
03:46:45.349 --> 03:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
very long period of time
 
03:46:47.929 --> 03:46:47.939 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately the lack of action in
 
03:46:49.849 --> 03:46:49.859 align:start position:0%
some cases would have been obvious if
 
03:46:52.130 --> 03:46:52.140 align:start position:0%
you had the records right would have
 
03:46:53.510 --> 03:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
been something that she could have then
 
03:46:57.410 --> 03:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
escalated the issue I think in terms of
 
03:46:59.269 --> 03:46:59.279 align:start position:0%
transparency we want to make sure the
 
03:47:00.889 --> 03:47:00.899 align:start position:0%
Department's doing the best possible job
 
03:47:02.090 --> 03:47:02.100 align:start position:0%
and the way to make sure that's
 
03:47:04.010 --> 03:47:04.020 align:start position:0%
happening is people who care about the
 
03:47:06.050 --> 03:47:06.060 align:start position:0%
children right and there's a list of one
 
03:47:07.969 --> 03:47:07.979 align:start position:0%
through nine that would be people and
 
03:47:09.469 --> 03:47:09.479 align:start position:0%
groups and organizations that care about
 
03:47:11.570 --> 03:47:11.580 align:start position:0%
their children can get access to the
 
03:47:14.030 --> 03:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
rear to the records
 
03:47:16.490 --> 03:47:16.500 align:start position:0%
the current system incentivizes if
 
03:47:18.530 --> 03:47:18.540 align:start position:0%
there's a problem oh we messed up we
 
03:47:20.090 --> 03:47:20.100 align:start position:0%
don't want to share that information and
 
03:47:21.710 --> 03:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying the department does that
 
03:47:24.650 --> 03:47:24.660 align:start position:0%
but it wouldn't the the currents the
 
03:47:26.690 --> 03:47:26.700 align:start position:0%
current structure actually could allow
 
03:47:28.429 --> 03:47:28.439 align:start position:0%
for that to happen because if there was
 
03:47:30.110 --> 03:47:30.120 align:start position:0%
a mistake they wouldn't want to share it
 
03:47:32.030 --> 03:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
as opposed to letting an independent
 
03:47:35.290 --> 03:47:35.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:38.090 --> 03:47:38.100 align:start position:0%
uh representative Raymond
 
03:47:40.370 --> 03:47:40.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for indulging me
 
03:47:41.929 --> 03:47:41.939 align:start position:0%
that questioning has led to another
 
03:47:44.150 --> 03:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
question popping in my head
 
03:47:46.309 --> 03:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
um and that is
 
03:47:50.210 --> 03:47:50.220 align:start position:0%
um is there a way to
 
03:47:53.510 --> 03:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
um address the goal of this which is to
 
03:47:57.410 --> 03:47:57.420 align:start position:0%
have oversight of the answer no through
 
03:47:58.690 --> 03:47:58.700 align:start position:0%
some other
 
03:48:01.849 --> 03:48:01.859 align:start position:0%
mechanisms such as an appeals process
 
03:48:04.130 --> 03:48:04.140 align:start position:0%
for someone who's told no if you request
 
03:48:06.110 --> 03:48:06.120 align:start position:0%
a record and you're said and the
 
03:48:08.210 --> 03:48:08.220 align:start position:0%
commissioner says no we don't want to
 
03:48:10.490 --> 03:48:10.500 align:start position:0%
release it because it's harmful or
 
03:48:12.889 --> 03:48:12.899 align:start position:0%
because the reports aren't ready or
 
03:48:16.070 --> 03:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
whatever the reason is is there
 
03:48:18.530 --> 03:48:18.540 align:start position:0%
um would it not be more efficient
 
03:48:21.070 --> 03:48:21.080 align:start position:0%
instead of changing state law to
 
03:48:26.030 --> 03:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
initiate a system within dcyf or within
 
03:48:28.010 --> 03:48:28.020 align:start position:0%
the office of the child advocate or
 
03:48:30.290 --> 03:48:30.300 align:start position:0%
someone else to take a look at this and
 
03:48:32.690 --> 03:48:32.700 align:start position:0%
say okay I'm going to appeal this
 
03:48:35.030 --> 03:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
decision of the commissioner
 
03:48:36.769 --> 03:48:36.779 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question that is a
 
03:48:39.590 --> 03:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
another way to address the same core
 
03:48:41.750 --> 03:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
issue right I think both processes that
 
03:48:43.490 --> 03:48:43.500 align:start position:0%
you just the one that's been proposed
 
03:48:45.590 --> 03:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
here and what you just talked about
 
03:48:47.929 --> 03:48:47.939 align:start position:0%
are allowing an independent agency in
 
03:48:49.729 --> 03:48:49.739 align:start position:0%
this case the judicial branch or maybe
 
03:48:52.670 --> 03:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
it's the child advocate office to be to
 
03:48:55.610 --> 03:48:55.620 align:start position:0%
to do the review and it only questions
 
03:48:58.190 --> 03:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
who prompts that action whether it's the
 
03:49:00.710 --> 03:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
department saying I have information
 
03:49:00.720 --> 03:49:02.630 align:start position:0%
department saying I have information
that

03:49:02.630 --> 03:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:49:04.790 --> 03:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
well I we believe that this information
 
03:49:07.910 --> 03:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
in this document here if release would
 
03:49:10.670 --> 03:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
further harm the child right versus the
 
03:49:12.290 --> 03:49:12.300 align:start position:0%
parent saying well I was just denied
 
03:49:14.510 --> 03:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
right routinely I'm I'm now going to
 
03:49:16.370 --> 03:49:16.380 align:start position:0%
appeal it either way there's going to be
 
03:49:18.469 --> 03:49:18.479 align:start position:0%
that presentation before the judicial
 
03:49:21.530 --> 03:49:21.540 align:start position:0%
branch and I think in most cases
 
03:49:23.150 --> 03:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
the bulk of these are the information
 
03:49:26.330 --> 03:49:26.340 align:start position:0%
should be shared there there needs to be
 
03:49:29.570 --> 03:49:29.580 align:start position:0%
some judicial carve out that allows for
 
03:49:31.969 --> 03:49:31.979 align:start position:0%
the commissioner and or designee to say
 
03:49:33.650 --> 03:49:33.660 align:start position:0%
hey I have a concern
 
03:49:36.110 --> 03:49:36.120 align:start position:0%
if this
 
03:49:37.490 --> 03:49:37.500 align:start position:0%
it's a sexual abuse case or something
 
03:49:39.530 --> 03:49:39.540 align:start position:0%
there's there's certain information here
 
03:49:41.330 --> 03:49:41.340 align:start position:0%
that we don't want shared for some
 
03:49:42.769 --> 03:49:42.779 align:start position:0%
reason we believe that this is going to
 
03:49:45.170 --> 03:49:45.180 align:start position:0%
create further harm to the child we want
 
03:49:48.650 --> 03:49:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:50.750 --> 03:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
so both are acceptable process this is
 
03:49:52.550 --> 03:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
just one way to solve it
 
03:49:54.769 --> 03:49:54.779 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson
 
03:49:57.290 --> 03:49:57.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:49:59.150 --> 03:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:50:00.889 --> 03:50:00.899 align:start position:0%
um my question is just
 
03:50:00.899 --> 03:50:01.790 align:start position:0%
um my question is just
um

03:50:01.790 --> 03:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:03.590 --> 03:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
are there any um
 
03:50:07.490 --> 03:50:07.500 align:start position:0%
time frames or Time guidelines or
 
03:50:07.500 --> 03:50:09.229 align:start position:0%
time frames or Time guidelines or
um

03:50:09.229 --> 03:50:09.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:09.239 --> 03:50:10.729 align:start position:0%
um
any

03:50:10.729 --> 03:50:10.739 align:start position:0%
any
 
03:50:12.790 --> 03:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
I'm just a little bit
 
03:50:15.410 --> 03:50:15.420 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
03:50:15.420 --> 03:50:17.090 align:start position:0%
concerned about
um

03:50:17.090 --> 03:50:17.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:21.530 --> 03:50:21.540 align:start position:0%
delays in being provided the information
 
03:50:25.010 --> 03:50:25.020 align:start position:0%
so there are time frames
 
03:50:29.450 --> 03:50:29.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:29.460 --> 03:50:30.469 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:50:30.469 --> 03:50:30.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:34.429 --> 03:50:34.439 align:start position:0%
I believe it's 30 days and 60 days
 
03:50:34.439 --> 03:50:36.950 align:start position:0%
I believe it's 30 days and 60 days
um

03:50:36.950 --> 03:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:36.960 --> 03:50:38.090 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:50:38.090 --> 03:50:38.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:40.070 --> 03:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
there are some time frames in statutes I
 
03:50:41.690 --> 03:50:41.700 align:start position:0%
need to go back and get you that answer
 
03:50:43.849 --> 03:50:43.859 align:start position:0%
how that applies
 
03:50:46.070 --> 03:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
um this section of Statute does I don't
 
03:50:47.950 --> 03:50:47.960 align:start position:0%
believe has a timeline driving
 
03:50:50.030 --> 03:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
disclosure of records and maybe that's
 
03:50:53.750 --> 03:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:57.110 --> 03:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you and um I guess also
 
03:50:59.450 --> 03:50:59.460 align:start position:0%
um thank you because I quickly skip um
 
03:51:00.889 --> 03:51:00.899 align:start position:0%
scan it and I couldn't find it so I
 
03:51:04.550 --> 03:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
appreciate that but also too would you
 
03:51:04.560 --> 03:51:05.809 align:start position:0%
appreciate that but also too would you
consider

03:51:05.809 --> 03:51:05.819 align:start position:0%
consider
 
03:51:05.819 --> 03:51:06.849 align:start position:0%
consider
um

03:51:06.849 --> 03:51:06.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:11.389 --> 03:51:11.399 align:start position:0%
a time frame for the petition and a time
 
03:51:11.399 --> 03:51:12.729 align:start position:0%
a time frame for the petition and a time
frame

03:51:12.729 --> 03:51:12.739 align:start position:0%
frame
 
03:51:17.570 --> 03:51:17.580 align:start position:0%
for a decision on this day like so my
 
03:51:19.910 --> 03:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
question is can
 
03:51:19.920 --> 03:51:21.590 align:start position:0%
question is can
um

03:51:21.590 --> 03:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:26.330 --> 03:51:26.340 align:start position:0%
can document just disclosure be delayed
 
03:51:28.849 --> 03:51:28.859 align:start position:0%
because of a backup in the court system
 
03:51:30.349 --> 03:51:30.359 align:start position:0%
and how could you prevent that from
 
03:51:30.359 --> 03:51:32.030 align:start position:0%
and how could you prevent that from
happening

03:51:32.030 --> 03:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
happening
 
03:51:35.510 --> 03:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
so theoretically it is possible right
 
03:51:37.309 --> 03:51:37.319 align:start position:0%
that the court system could right
 
03:51:39.349 --> 03:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
because they have their own schedule and
 
03:51:41.690 --> 03:51:41.700 align:start position:0%
scheduling of a hearing
 
03:51:41.700 --> 03:51:42.950 align:start position:0%
scheduling of a hearing
um

03:51:42.950 --> 03:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:46.250 --> 03:51:46.260 align:start position:0%
this might not the reason I did it this
 
03:51:49.309 --> 03:51:49.319 align:start position:0%
way is if the Department's the one
 
03:51:51.769 --> 03:51:51.779 align:start position:0%
saying these records are so important
 
03:51:53.870 --> 03:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
and would potentially damage the child
 
03:51:55.969 --> 03:51:55.979 align:start position:0%
they can go directly to the judge would
 
03:51:57.590 --> 03:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
be a lot easier than scheduling it the
 
03:51:59.690 --> 03:51:59.700 align:start position:0%
other way where the petition the family
 
03:52:01.790 --> 03:52:01.800 align:start position:0%
starts the request now you're going to
 
03:52:02.990 --> 03:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
have you have to schedule a court
 
03:52:04.130 --> 03:52:04.140 align:start position:0%
hearing there's a bunch of other things
 
03:52:06.110 --> 03:52:06.120 align:start position:0%
that happens making it even more
 
03:52:08.690 --> 03:52:08.700 align:start position:0%
difficult time wise if an independent
 
03:52:10.309 --> 03:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
judge turns around looks at the records
 
03:52:12.590 --> 03:52:12.600 align:start position:0%
and says yes this I could see the
 
03:52:13.849 --> 03:52:13.859 align:start position:0%
argument why the commissioner doesn't
 
03:52:15.410 --> 03:52:15.420 align:start position:0%
want to release these these need to stay
 
03:52:17.330 --> 03:52:17.340 align:start position:0%
confidential that might kick off an
 
03:52:19.610 --> 03:52:19.620 align:start position:0%
appeal process to to kind of to
 
03:52:21.590 --> 03:52:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond's question or
 
03:52:23.630 --> 03:52:23.640 align:start position:0%
earlier comment about do we need an
 
03:52:26.090 --> 03:52:26.100 align:start position:0%
appeal process
 
03:52:28.070 --> 03:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
um I didn't get into the nitty-gritty in
 
03:52:30.110 --> 03:52:30.120 align:start position:0%
terms of the details what I saw though
 
03:52:32.330 --> 03:52:32.340 align:start position:0%
the fundamental problem that needs to be
 
03:52:34.990 --> 03:52:35.000 align:start position:0%
solved is we have the same Department
 
03:52:37.670 --> 03:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
overseeing their work being the one who
 
03:52:38.990 --> 03:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
gets the ultimate Authority whether
 
03:52:40.790 --> 03:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
their work should ever be disclosed and
 
03:52:43.250 --> 03:52:43.260 align:start position:0%
and and we should do our best job
 
03:52:45.469 --> 03:52:45.479 align:start position:0%
protecting the children and if that is
 
03:52:47.690 --> 03:52:47.700 align:start position:0%
the goal of us as a state it would be
 
03:52:51.110 --> 03:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
wise to make sure that if there's ever
 
03:52:53.809 --> 03:52:53.819 align:start position:0%
a failure to act maybe or an
 
03:52:56.150 --> 03:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
overreaction maybe
 
03:52:59.030 --> 03:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
um a misdiagnosis something all of that
 
03:53:01.429 --> 03:53:01.439 align:start position:0%
information is available and that it has
 
03:53:04.550 --> 03:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
an independent oversight group
 
03:53:06.530 --> 03:53:06.540 align:start position:0%
I will take and get back to you
 
03:53:08.450 --> 03:53:08.460 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson on time frame I
 
03:53:10.070 --> 03:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
got to go through it's been a couple
 
03:53:11.269 --> 03:53:11.279 align:start position:0%
years since I've actually read through
 
03:53:14.809 --> 03:53:14.819 align:start position:0%
all of 170. thank you appreciate it
 
03:53:16.250 --> 03:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
any further questions for the
 
03:53:18.349 --> 03:53:18.359 align:start position:0%
representative representative Bickford
 
03:53:21.590 --> 03:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman my uh concern with
 
03:53:24.130 --> 03:53:24.140 align:start position:0%
this is it looks like
 
03:53:27.170 --> 03:53:27.180 align:start position:0%
dcyf will go to the court and ask them
 
03:53:28.429 --> 03:53:28.439 align:start position:0%
if they can
 
03:53:32.929 --> 03:53:32.939 align:start position:0%
uh not we give it out but the parent
 
03:53:35.210 --> 03:53:35.220 align:start position:0%
that wants it is not there so it's kind
 
03:53:38.330 --> 03:53:38.340 align:start position:0%
of a one-sided Affair which is kind of
 
03:53:41.410 --> 03:53:41.420 align:start position:0%
unusual in a court setting
 
03:53:44.809 --> 03:53:44.819 align:start position:0%
so this thank you for the question it's
 
03:53:46.550 --> 03:53:46.560 align:start position:0%
a great question that goes to should
 
03:53:48.290 --> 03:53:48.300 align:start position:0%
there be an appeal process the first
 
03:53:50.870 --> 03:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
review could be a judicial review of
 
03:53:53.330 --> 03:53:53.340 align:start position:0%
this information and if the parent then
 
03:53:55.729 --> 03:53:55.739 align:start position:0%
believes that that judicial review
 
03:53:57.950 --> 03:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
wasn't done correctly then you could
 
03:54:01.910 --> 03:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
kick off some sort of appeal
 
03:54:04.010 --> 03:54:04.020 align:start position:0%
in the port system where the parent says
 
03:54:05.510 --> 03:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
well the judge looked at it and they
 
03:54:07.070 --> 03:54:07.080 align:start position:0%
came up with the same conclusion but
 
03:54:09.170 --> 03:54:09.180 align:start position:0%
I've got to believe that the that the
 
03:54:11.210 --> 03:54:11.220 align:start position:0%
judge looking at this would be is
 
03:54:13.010 --> 03:54:13.020 align:start position:0%
supposed to be fair and impartial that
 
03:54:14.990 --> 03:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
if the information is truly that
 
03:54:17.630 --> 03:54:17.640 align:start position:0%
dangerous to release that
 
03:54:19.010 --> 03:54:19.020 align:start position:0%
um the judicial review would be pretty
 
03:54:19.020 --> 03:54:20.990 align:start position:0%
um the judicial review would be pretty
simple

03:54:20.990 --> 03:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
simple
 
03:54:23.330 --> 03:54:23.340 align:start position:0%
follow up but dcyf has got there yeah
 
03:54:24.349 --> 03:54:24.359 align:start position:0%
they're the ones that are going there
 
03:54:26.990 --> 03:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
and saying by the way it's a step in the
 
03:54:28.490 --> 03:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
right direction does it solve every case
 
03:54:31.610 --> 03:54:31.620 align:start position:0%
maybe not right but at least we have the
 
03:54:32.870 --> 03:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
chance that there's an independent
 
03:54:34.910 --> 03:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
review today there is no independent
 
03:54:36.889 --> 03:54:36.899 align:start position:0%
review the same agency producing the
 
03:54:39.410 --> 03:54:39.420 align:start position:0%
information gets to say well trust me I
 
03:54:41.689 --> 03:54:41.699 align:start position:0%
have this and it's really damaging to
 
03:54:43.670 --> 03:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
the child but I'm not going to show you
 
03:54:46.010 --> 03:54:46.020 align:start position:0%
what's here because I'm I've decided to
 
03:54:49.070 --> 03:54:49.080 align:start position:0%
keep it hidden that doesn't that type of
 
03:54:50.750 --> 03:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
thing doesn't work in our society in
 
03:54:52.250 --> 03:54:52.260 align:start position:0%
terms of openness and transparency
 
03:54:53.809 --> 03:54:53.819 align:start position:0%
that's why I said this should be a
 
03:54:56.030 --> 03:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
reasonably non-partisan issue to make
 
03:54:58.610 --> 03:54:58.620 align:start position:0%
sure that when there is information
 
03:55:00.950 --> 03:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
that's available that it be given to the
 
03:55:04.250 --> 03:55:04.260 align:start position:0%
list of nine nine people in groups and
 
03:55:06.530 --> 03:55:06.540 align:start position:0%
only in the rare case where it would be
 
03:55:09.469 --> 03:55:09.479 align:start position:0%
harmful to the child would it be kept
 
03:55:11.630 --> 03:55:11.640 align:start position:0%
confidential and only when there's a
 
03:55:13.729 --> 03:55:13.739 align:start position:0%
judicial review
 
03:55:15.530 --> 03:55:15.540 align:start position:0%
to make that happen
 
03:55:18.349 --> 03:55:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:20.330 --> 03:55:20.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Representatives seeing no more
 
03:55:23.389 --> 03:55:23.399 align:start position:0%
questions the chair recognizes Beth it
 
03:55:27.469 --> 03:55:27.479 align:start position:0%
looks like Morgan from dcyf
 
03:55:30.650 --> 03:55:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:33.110 --> 03:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
not chair I am Beth margison I'm sorry I
 
03:55:34.790 --> 03:55:34.800 align:start position:0%

going to be Beth Morganson on all of
 
03:55:38.689 --> 03:55:38.699 align:start position:0%

03:55:42.530 --> 03:55:42.540 align:start position:0%

oh you did it okay sorry that's good so
 
03:55:51.349 --> 03:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chair and vice chair and
 
03:55:52.490 --> 03:55:52.500 align:start position:0%
the members of the committee for the
 
03:55:53.870 --> 03:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak here tonight on
 
03:55:56.450 --> 03:55:56.460 align:start position:0%
this today on this bill I just wanted to
 
03:56:00.290 --> 03:56:00.300 align:start position:0%
give the the committee some background
 
03:56:02.570 --> 03:56:02.580 align:start position:0%
um just sort of starting from going back
 
03:56:06.469 --> 03:56:06.479 align:start position:0%
and then forward 170 g8a requires the
 
03:56:08.510 --> 03:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
division to produce all records to the
 
03:56:10.610 --> 03:56:10.620 align:start position:0%
people representative wholes exactly
 
03:56:12.950 --> 03:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
right there are nine entities to which
 
03:56:15.950 --> 03:56:15.960 align:start position:0%
records can be released the exemptions
 
03:56:18.050 --> 03:56:18.060 align:start position:0%
from those records are things like third
 
03:56:20.269 --> 03:56:20.279 align:start position:0%
party records doctors records school
 
03:56:22.849 --> 03:56:22.859 align:start position:0%
records things that are submitted to
 
03:56:24.530 --> 03:56:24.540 align:start position:0%
courts I forget what the other
 
03:56:27.050 --> 03:56:27.060 align:start position:0%
exemptions are there is no exemption for
 
03:56:29.389 --> 03:56:29.399 align:start position:0%
the division to not divulge information
 
03:56:31.969 --> 03:56:31.979 align:start position:0%
that might be damaging to to it we do
 
03:56:34.790 --> 03:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
not withhold that those go whatever is
 
03:56:38.330 --> 03:56:38.340 align:start position:0%
in the case File that we have to furnish
 
03:56:41.570 --> 03:56:41.580 align:start position:0%
to any of those entities goes out the
 
03:56:44.090 --> 03:56:44.100 align:start position:0%
time frame for producing those records
 
03:56:47.929 --> 03:56:47.939 align:start position:0%
is 60 days however the division is very
 
03:56:50.090 --> 03:56:50.100 align:start position:0%
behind on records requests because we
 
03:56:51.950 --> 03:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
have been trying to set up a records
 
03:56:54.250 --> 03:56:54.260 align:start position:0%
request unit for years in order to
 
03:56:57.229 --> 03:56:57.239 align:start position:0%
facilitate and expedite records to
 
03:56:59.150 --> 03:56:59.160 align:start position:0%
individuals whose right it is to have
 
03:57:01.790 --> 03:57:01.800 align:start position:0%
those records and we feel very strongly
 
03:57:03.950 --> 03:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
about getting those records to them
 
03:57:07.070 --> 03:57:07.080 align:start position:0%
as to the legislation itself
 
03:57:11.510 --> 03:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
the division does not withhold records
 
03:57:14.330 --> 03:57:14.340 align:start position:0%
unless there is an open assessment going
 
03:57:16.849 --> 03:57:16.859 align:start position:0%
on or a concurrent criminal
 
03:57:19.189 --> 03:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
investigation at the request of the
 
03:57:21.170 --> 03:57:21.180 align:start position:0%
police when the investigate when a
 
03:57:23.389 --> 03:57:23.399 align:start position:0%
criminal investigation or an assessment
 
03:57:26.809 --> 03:57:26.819 align:start position:0%
is closed then we're able to to release
 
03:57:30.050 --> 03:57:30.060 align:start position:0%
records that is the harm to the child
 
03:57:32.630 --> 03:57:32.640 align:start position:0%
it's whether we need to make sure that
 
03:57:34.550 --> 03:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
the assessment is done without any kind
 
03:57:34.560 --> 03:57:35.870 align:start position:0%
the assessment is done without any kind
of

03:57:35.870 --> 03:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:57:38.330 --> 03:57:38.340 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't say interference but just
 
03:57:40.610 --> 03:57:40.620 align:start position:0%
making sure that the assessment is done
 
03:57:42.650 --> 03:57:42.660 align:start position:0%
by the division and if there's any
 
03:57:45.650 --> 03:57:45.660 align:start position:0%
criminal investigation that is is part
 
03:57:47.210 --> 03:57:47.220 align:start position:0%
of that you know is sort of going
 
03:57:49.189 --> 03:57:49.199 align:start position:0%
alongside the division the assessment
 
03:57:51.469 --> 03:57:51.479 align:start position:0%
then with that's the only time that we
 
03:57:55.130 --> 03:57:55.140 align:start position:0%
actually withhold uh releasing records
 
03:57:56.990 --> 03:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
so I have any questions if anyone like
 
03:57:59.870 --> 03:57:59.880 align:start position:0%
to would uh ask me something I mean
 
03:58:03.590 --> 03:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
there are there is this is a records
 
03:58:05.450 --> 03:58:05.460 align:start position:0%
request but there are instances where
 
03:58:07.750 --> 03:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
the division is in court with a parent
 
03:58:11.150 --> 03:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
and uh parents are actually provided
 
03:58:14.570 --> 03:58:14.580 align:start position:0%
Discovery and that is a fuller uh set of
 
03:58:16.309 --> 03:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
case records that does include third
 
03:58:18.110 --> 03:58:18.120 align:start position:0%
party records
 
03:58:20.870 --> 03:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
um so that is that in that case the
 
03:58:22.610 --> 03:58:22.620 align:start position:0%
parent if the parent is court involved
 
03:58:24.830 --> 03:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
with dcyf they do receive all of the
 
03:58:27.410 --> 03:58:27.420 align:start position:0%
records because it's discovery
 
03:58:30.290 --> 03:58:30.300 align:start position:0%
let me read section B after the nine
 
03:58:33.110 --> 03:58:33.120 align:start position:0%
people mentioned section B says the
 
03:58:35.510 --> 03:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
department shall disclose information
 
03:58:38.090 --> 03:58:38.100 align:start position:0%
from case records or provide access to
 
03:58:40.790 --> 03:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
case records to the following persons or
 
03:58:44.210 --> 03:58:44.220 align:start position:0%
entities I will jump down to sub 4 the
 
03:58:46.010 --> 03:58:46.020 align:start position:0%
person or entity with whom the child
 
03:58:48.349 --> 03:58:48.359 align:start position:0%
resides if that person is not the
 
03:58:50.650 --> 03:58:50.660 align:start position:0%
child's parent guardian or custodian
 
03:58:53.269 --> 03:58:53.279 align:start position:0%
continues if such information or access
 
03:58:55.550 --> 03:58:55.560 align:start position:0%
is not harmful to the child and is
 
03:58:57.469 --> 03:58:57.479 align:start position:0%
necessary in order to enable the person
 
03:59:01.010 --> 03:59:01.020 align:start position:0%
or entity to act to evaluate provide
 
03:59:02.689 --> 03:59:02.699 align:start position:0%
services and so on
 
03:59:06.469 --> 03:59:06.479 align:start position:0%
I think the question that is begged is
 
03:59:09.170 --> 03:59:09.180 align:start position:0%
who determines
 
03:59:10.670 --> 03:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
um harmful
 
03:59:12.769 --> 03:59:12.779 align:start position:0%
that is the commissioner harmful is an
 
03:59:14.929 --> 03:59:14.939 align:start position:0%
open assessment in that case um I don't
 
03:59:16.910 --> 03:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
have the statute in front of me but I
 
03:59:19.189 --> 03:59:19.199 align:start position:0%
believe four is our foster parents and
 
03:59:22.670 --> 03:59:22.680 align:start position:0%
we are allowed to release limit
 
03:59:24.769 --> 03:59:24.779 align:start position:0%
information to foster parents in order
 
03:59:26.830 --> 03:59:26.840 align:start position:0%
to help with the provision of services
 
03:59:30.830 --> 03:59:30.840 align:start position:0%
for children and the key point in that
 
03:59:32.990 --> 03:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
statute is the department shall it's
 
03:59:35.929 --> 03:59:35.939 align:start position:0%
mandatory we have to do it
 
03:59:40.309 --> 03:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
the only block on you have to release is
 
03:59:42.590 --> 03:59:42.600 align:start position:0%
if in your determination to do so would
 
03:59:45.469 --> 03:59:45.479 align:start position:0%
to be harmful yes so it's a part it's a
 
03:59:47.510 --> 03:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
positive push statement here it's not an
 
03:59:49.490 --> 03:59:49.500 align:start position:0%
allowance you must do it we must do it
 
03:59:54.590 --> 03:59:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:57.650 --> 03:59:57.660 align:start position:0%
then we have a I have a quandary because
 
04:00:00.290 --> 04:00:00.300 align:start position:0%
the bill before me at least in my mind
 
04:00:03.349 --> 04:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
seems to indicate this hasn't been done
 
04:00:07.370 --> 04:00:07.380 align:start position:0%
at least in some instances and the
 
04:00:09.950 --> 04:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
um Prime sponsor wishes to make
 
04:00:11.809 --> 04:00:11.819 align:start position:0%
something happen so I'm not quite sure
 
04:00:14.809 --> 04:00:14.819 align:start position:0%
why we're here I don't either I think
 
04:00:16.309 --> 04:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
that's probably a better question for
 
04:00:17.929 --> 04:00:17.939 align:start position:0%
the sponsor I'm going to ask the him
 
04:00:19.729 --> 04:00:19.739 align:start position:0%
that in a minute when we're done asking
 
04:00:21.530 --> 04:00:21.540 align:start position:0%
you I'll give him another bite at the
 
04:00:24.889 --> 04:00:24.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:26.929 --> 04:00:26.939 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond
 
04:00:29.689 --> 04:00:29.699 align:start position:0%
uh thank you and um thank you so much
 
04:00:31.969 --> 04:00:31.979 align:start position:0%
Miss Morganson for being here
 
04:00:33.710 --> 04:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
um you said that there's a bit of a
 
04:00:36.590 --> 04:00:36.600 align:start position:0%
delay happening on records requests um
 
04:00:38.710 --> 04:00:38.720 align:start position:0%
and I remember that from my time
 
04:00:41.689 --> 04:00:41.699 align:start position:0%
although five ten years ago
 
04:00:43.130 --> 04:00:43.140 align:start position:0%
um that it took some time but sometimes
 
04:00:44.689 --> 04:00:44.699 align:start position:0%
we had parents come in and read the file
 
04:00:47.210 --> 04:00:47.220 align:start position:0%
or whatever do you know what that delay
 
04:00:50.870 --> 04:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
is on average Statewide I don't okay I
 
04:00:50.880 --> 04:00:51.590 align:start position:0%
is on average Statewide I don't okay I
don't

04:00:51.590 --> 04:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
don't
 
04:00:54.170 --> 04:00:54.180 align:start position:0%
it's uh but I think it's we're past the
 
04:00:56.750 --> 04:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
60 days I just know that we have you
 
04:00:59.450 --> 04:00:59.460 align:start position:0%
know the attorneys have to do the review
 
04:01:01.010 --> 04:01:01.020 align:start position:0%
of the records before they're sent out
 
04:01:03.349 --> 04:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
to make sure that those those other
 
04:01:05.570 --> 04:01:05.580 align:start position:0%
records are not included in it
 
04:01:08.809 --> 04:01:08.819 align:start position:0%
um and uh it you know we're
 
04:01:10.610 --> 04:01:10.620 align:start position:0%
short staffed in the legal services
 
04:01:13.729 --> 04:01:13.739 align:start position:0%
right now so and then uh follow-up
 
04:01:16.250 --> 04:01:16.260 align:start position:0%
regarding follow-up thank you so much
 
04:01:19.250 --> 04:01:19.260 align:start position:0%
um regarding open assessments and open
 
04:01:22.189 --> 04:01:22.199 align:start position:0%
concurrent police investigations I
 
04:01:24.530 --> 04:01:24.540 align:start position:0%
recall that a number of cases have
 
04:01:26.330 --> 04:01:26.340 align:start position:0%
concurrent police investigations and
 
04:01:27.889 --> 04:01:27.899 align:start position:0%
there's uh at least in Nashville there
 
04:01:29.570 --> 04:01:29.580 align:start position:0%
was a high level of cooperation between
 
04:01:34.030 --> 04:01:34.040 align:start position:0%
the police and dcyf what would happen if
 
04:01:37.610 --> 04:01:37.620 align:start position:0%
dcyf were to release records while
 
04:01:40.130 --> 04:01:40.140 align:start position:0%
there's a police investigation
 
04:01:41.750 --> 04:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you can say generally
 
04:01:43.130 --> 04:01:43.140 align:start position:0%
what would happen I think everything's
 
04:01:46.010 --> 04:01:46.020 align:start position:0%
on a case-by-case basis I I don't I mean
 
04:01:47.570 --> 04:01:47.580 align:start position:0%
again I don't want to generalize because
 
04:01:51.469 --> 04:01:51.479 align:start position:0%
I don't know the full landscape here but
 
04:01:53.330 --> 04:01:53.340 align:start position:0%
I think it would be unlikely that the
 
04:01:54.769 --> 04:01:54.779 align:start position:0%
division would actually release records
 
04:01:56.269 --> 04:01:56.279 align:start position:0%
while there was a criminal investigation
 
04:01:59.330 --> 04:01:59.340 align:start position:0%
ongoing okay thank you Mr representative
 
04:02:02.030 --> 04:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
long thank you Mr chairman a couple of
 
04:02:04.130 --> 04:02:04.140 align:start position:0%
questions have I made following uh
 
04:02:07.070 --> 04:02:07.080 align:start position:0%
representative uh Raymond's question
 
04:02:07.080 --> 04:02:07.670 align:start position:0%
representative uh Raymond's question
um

04:02:07.670 --> 04:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:10.370 --> 04:02:10.380 align:start position:0%
would you assume that the update of
 
04:02:12.710 --> 04:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
Investigations would also be released or
 
04:02:14.510 --> 04:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
would that be another request
 
04:02:17.570 --> 04:02:17.580 align:start position:0%
If This Were to pass and and you would
 
04:02:21.229 --> 04:02:21.239 align:start position:0%
be required to give that information
 
04:02:24.110 --> 04:02:24.120 align:start position:0%
well as I understand it we would have to
 
04:02:25.670 --> 04:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
petition the court to make an
 
04:02:27.769 --> 04:02:27.779 align:start position:0%
independent verification as to whether
 
04:02:30.410 --> 04:02:30.420 align:start position:0%
or not we can release the records okay
 
04:02:32.769 --> 04:02:32.779 align:start position:0%
and if it were released would
 
04:02:36.889 --> 04:02:36.899 align:start position:0%
updated investigations be uh
 
04:02:39.769 --> 04:02:39.779 align:start position:0%
required in your opinion or would that
 
04:02:41.450 --> 04:02:41.460 align:start position:0%
any update would have to go back to
 
04:02:44.750 --> 04:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
court well generally when we do records
 
04:02:47.210 --> 04:02:47.220 align:start position:0%
requests we generally include all the
 
04:02:49.370 --> 04:02:49.380 align:start position:0%
information you know sometimes parents
 
04:02:51.530 --> 04:02:51.540 align:start position:0%
will say this referral but we'll find
 
04:02:53.450 --> 04:02:53.460 align:start position:0%
out that there's other records or some
 
04:02:55.670 --> 04:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
you know and we generally will include
 
04:02:58.189 --> 04:02:58.199 align:start position:0%
all the records um we you know we have
 
04:03:01.010 --> 04:03:01.020 align:start position:0%
11 district offices and oftentimes we
 
04:03:02.510 --> 04:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
will have
 
04:03:04.849 --> 04:03:04.859 align:start position:0%
um cases that go across all the district
 
04:03:07.670 --> 04:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
offices and so we have a policy in our
 
04:03:10.849 --> 04:03:10.859 align:start position:0%
in our office that the whatever office
 
04:03:13.429 --> 04:03:13.439 align:start position:0%
gets the request has to gather all other
 
04:03:16.070 --> 04:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
requests from other district offices I'm
 
04:03:17.510 --> 04:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
gonna fall off I mean this chairman
 
04:03:18.590 --> 04:03:18.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:03:18.600 --> 04:03:19.429 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

04:03:19.429 --> 04:03:19.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:22.510 --> 04:03:22.520 align:start position:0%
so a physical health
 
04:03:26.510 --> 04:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
entity would get this information are
 
04:03:29.090 --> 04:03:29.100 align:start position:0%
there are there deductions for example
 
04:03:30.889 --> 04:03:30.899 align:start position:0%
if the child had a psychological
 
04:03:33.410 --> 04:03:33.420 align:start position:0%
evaluation would the physical health
 
04:03:36.050 --> 04:03:36.060 align:start position:0%
doctor get that that would be for a
 
04:03:38.450 --> 04:03:38.460 align:start position:0%
child generally you know I I don't have
 
04:03:39.769 --> 04:03:39.779 align:start position:0%
the statue in front of me that would be
 
04:03:43.729 --> 04:03:43.739 align:start position:0%
for a child who is in our custody or we
 
04:03:45.530 --> 04:03:45.540 align:start position:0%
have perhaps legal supervision for and
 
04:03:47.990 --> 04:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
we're trying to provide services for
 
04:03:49.189 --> 04:03:49.199 align:start position:0%
them we would give live ended
 
04:03:51.410 --> 04:03:51.420 align:start position:0%
information to that doctor to provide
 
04:03:54.590 --> 04:03:54.600 align:start position:0%
services when we're doing just a records
 
04:03:55.969 --> 04:03:55.979 align:start position:0%
request I know this is a little
 
04:03:58.070 --> 04:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
confusing it's there was no case the
 
04:04:00.110 --> 04:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
assessment closed we handed over
 
04:04:03.889 --> 04:04:03.899 align:start position:0%
generally to the parents if we do have
 
04:04:06.530 --> 04:04:06.540 align:start position:0%
information from a medical provider we
 
04:04:08.630 --> 04:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
can't release that under this current
 
04:04:12.110 --> 04:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
statute but what we do is we provide the
 
04:04:15.650 --> 04:04:15.660 align:start position:0%
parent with the name address the
 
04:04:17.330 --> 04:04:17.340 align:start position:0%
information that they would need so that
 
04:04:19.370 --> 04:04:19.380 align:start position:0%
they could go get that that information
 
04:04:20.990 --> 04:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
generally is from their own child's
 
04:04:23.269 --> 04:04:23.279 align:start position:0%
pediatrician so it's it's they generally
 
04:04:26.870 --> 04:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
are able to get it okay thank you
 
04:04:28.790 --> 04:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I would like to call
 
04:04:31.490 --> 04:04:31.500 align:start position:0%
Representative holback because I do have
 
04:04:34.729 --> 04:04:34.739 align:start position:0%
this um conundrum here the given section
 
04:04:38.870 --> 04:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
B of 170 G8 uh that the department shall
 
04:04:41.110 --> 04:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
disclose information
 
04:04:46.689 --> 04:04:46.699 align:start position:0%

consideration necessitated this bill
representative

04:04:51.050 --> 04:04:51.060 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:04:53.090 --> 04:04:53.100 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:04:55.849 --> 04:04:55.859 align:start position:0%
um so key study of one I hate case
 
04:04:58.070 --> 04:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
studies level one I'm an engineer I like
 
04:05:01.070 --> 04:05:01.080 align:start position:0%
looking at larger data sets than one so
 
04:05:03.170 --> 04:05:03.180 align:start position:0%
maybe I'm maybe our family was the
 
04:05:05.469 --> 04:05:05.479 align:start position:0%
anomaly and the other
 
04:05:08.750 --> 04:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
99.9999 of families that have
 
04:05:10.250 --> 04:05:10.260 align:start position:0%
experienced their
 
04:05:12.530 --> 04:05:12.540 align:start position:0%
an interaction with dcyf have never had
 
04:05:15.110 --> 04:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
any issues getting information from the
 
04:05:15.120 --> 04:05:17.269 align:start position:0%
any issues getting information from the
Department

04:05:17.269 --> 04:05:17.279 align:start position:0%
Department
 
04:05:18.830 --> 04:05:18.840 align:start position:0%
I thought this would be pretty simple
 
04:05:21.710 --> 04:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
the statute was pretty obvious right I
 
04:05:22.610 --> 04:05:22.620 align:start position:0%
should be able to request the
 
04:05:25.670 --> 04:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
information it there was it was withheld
 
04:05:27.070 --> 04:05:27.080 align:start position:0%
in our case
 
04:05:29.689 --> 04:05:29.699 align:start position:0%
and in talking with some other families
 
04:05:31.849 --> 04:05:31.859 align:start position:0%
I'm now understanding that there's a
 
04:05:34.670 --> 04:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
reluctance to share the information that
 
04:05:36.410 --> 04:05:36.420 align:start position:0%
the department has
 
04:05:39.290 --> 04:05:39.300 align:start position:0%
so yes it says shall
 
04:05:41.210 --> 04:05:41.220 align:start position:0%
but there's a carve out that allows the
 
04:05:41.220 --> 04:05:42.650 align:start position:0%
but there's a carve out that allows the
department

04:05:42.650 --> 04:05:42.660 align:start position:0%
department
 
04:05:45.530 --> 04:05:45.540 align:start position:0%
today to turn around and say we're going
 
04:05:49.429 --> 04:05:49.439 align:start position:0%
to ignore the shall because we can via
 
04:05:51.469 --> 04:05:51.479 align:start position:0%
the Commissioner's Office determining
 
04:05:54.410 --> 04:05:54.420 align:start position:0%
that this is not right determines right
 
04:05:55.729 --> 04:05:55.739 align:start position:0%
that's the word that's in statute
 
04:05:57.530 --> 04:05:57.540 align:start position:0%
determines that this could harm the
 
04:06:00.050 --> 04:06:00.060 align:start position:0%
child but there's no metric no standard
 
04:06:02.090 --> 04:06:02.100 align:start position:0%
for the word determines there and
 
04:06:04.969 --> 04:06:04.979 align:start position:0%
there's no independent oversight
 
04:06:06.769 --> 04:06:06.779 align:start position:0%
I don't see how we do this in other
 
04:06:08.809 --> 04:06:08.819 align:start position:0%
branches when there's a when there's a
 
04:06:10.670 --> 04:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
decision-making body in other branches
 
04:06:13.130 --> 04:06:13.140 align:start position:0%
and someone says that's not fair we
 
04:06:15.229 --> 04:06:15.239 align:start position:0%
typically kick it over to the judicial
 
04:06:18.170 --> 04:06:18.180 align:start position:0%
branch for an independent evaluation
 
04:06:19.849 --> 04:06:19.859 align:start position:0%
representative it goes back to my
 
04:06:24.229 --> 04:06:24.239 align:start position:0%
question under 178 g eight a uh excuse
 
04:06:27.530 --> 04:06:27.540 align:start position:0%
me B that the department shall disclose
 
04:06:31.370 --> 04:06:31.380 align:start position:0%
unless and it's the unless is not
 
04:06:33.710 --> 04:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
harmful to the child
 
04:06:36.469 --> 04:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
and that begs the question as to what
 
04:06:38.269 --> 04:06:38.279 align:start position:0%
constitutes that and who makes that
 
04:06:41.389 --> 04:06:41.399 align:start position:0%
decision so it is the people making the
 
04:06:43.670 --> 04:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
decisions themselves without independent
 
04:06:46.070 --> 04:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
review am I tracking with you here yes
 
04:06:46.080 --> 04:06:49.849 align:start position:0%
review am I tracking with you here yes
okay

04:06:49.849 --> 04:06:49.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:52.250 --> 04:06:52.260 align:start position:0%
anything you want to add I think I'm all
 
04:06:56.150 --> 04:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
set okay good thank you and that's it in
 
04:06:59.330 --> 04:06:59.340 align:start position:0%
terms of pink cards and don't run away
 
04:07:00.469 --> 04:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
because we're going to start something
 
04:07:04.610 --> 04:07:04.620 align:start position:0%
else this ends the hearing on
 
04:07:06.650 --> 04:07:06.660 align:start position:0%
uh whatever we are having a hearing on
 
04:07:12.229 --> 04:07:12.239 align:start position:0%
497. 497 and now we open the hearing on
 
04:07:15.590 --> 04:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
what's next and I'm all over the place
 
04:07:15.600 --> 04:07:16.750 align:start position:0%
what's next and I'm all over the place
here

04:07:16.750 --> 04:07:16.760 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:07:22.130 --> 04:07:22.140 align:start position:0%
5 35 open the hearing on HP 535 and
 
04:07:24.650 --> 04:07:24.660 align:start position:0%
representative Hull
 
04:07:26.689 --> 04:07:26.699 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman members of children
 
04:07:28.750 --> 04:07:28.760 align:start position:0%

04:07:31.969 --> 04:07:31.979 align:start position:0%
representative hole Dunbarton former

member of children family law about a
 
04:07:38.510 --> 04:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
decade ago the bill before you has to do
 
04:07:41.290 --> 04:07:41.300 align:start position:0%
with whether a child
 
04:07:44.990 --> 04:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
and child in our statutes is everybody
 
04:07:48.710 --> 04:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
from 0 through 18 and I will bring I
 
04:07:51.110 --> 04:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
will come back to that point is entitled
 
04:07:56.269 --> 04:07:56.279 align:start position:0%
to have their view represented in court
 
04:07:57.830 --> 04:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
um I believe the committee researcher
 
04:08:00.590 --> 04:08:00.600 align:start position:0%
has turned in a packet that looks like
 
04:08:03.110 --> 04:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
this that you guys were given I would
 
04:08:04.429 --> 04:08:04.439 align:start position:0%
like to see if I can get the electronic
 
04:08:07.490 --> 04:08:07.500 align:start position:0%
copy of this yes that packet
 
04:08:09.410 --> 04:08:09.420 align:start position:0%
I would like you to flip to this chart
 
04:08:09.420 --> 04:08:10.969 align:start position:0%
I would like you to flip to this chart
here

04:08:10.969 --> 04:08:10.979 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:08:14.870 --> 04:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
page I don't know about four four
 
04:08:17.150 --> 04:08:17.160 align:start position:0%
there's a large map of the US it's
 
04:08:19.370 --> 04:08:19.380 align:start position:0%
another page four because there's
 
04:08:21.050 --> 04:08:21.060 align:start position:0%
several page fours
 
04:08:23.269 --> 04:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
it's the fourth piece of paper in our
 
04:08:26.750 --> 04:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
fifth piece of paper or so in the packet
 
04:08:26.760 --> 04:08:27.849 align:start position:0%
fifth piece of paper or so in the packet
foreign

04:08:27.849 --> 04:08:27.859 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:08:30.349 --> 04:08:30.359 align:start position:0%
I discovered the issue that this bill
 
04:08:32.630 --> 04:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
tries to address
 
04:08:37.189 --> 04:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:39.830 --> 04:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
paid last year
 
04:08:41.809 --> 04:08:41.819 align:start position:0%
in that case we had a teenager who
 
04:08:43.490 --> 04:08:43.500 align:start position:0%
wanted to have their own view shared in
 
04:08:45.410 --> 04:08:45.420 align:start position:0%
the courtroom and that wasn't allowed
 
04:08:47.389 --> 04:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
and I said well wait a minute so we
 
04:08:49.429 --> 04:08:49.439 align:start position:0%
ended up hiring an attorney for him that
 
04:08:50.630 --> 04:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
was the easiest way to take care of it
 
04:08:52.429 --> 04:08:52.439 align:start position:0%
we hired an attorney we paid the bills
 
04:08:53.929 --> 04:08:53.939 align:start position:0%
and he got to go talk to the attorney
 
04:08:55.670 --> 04:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
and the attorney showed up in court on
 
04:08:58.969 --> 04:08:58.979 align:start position:0%
our behalf on our son's behalf but I
 
04:09:00.830 --> 04:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
found out in in speaking with this
 
04:09:03.110 --> 04:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
attorney and others that were one of the
 
04:09:05.030 --> 04:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
few states that does not allow children
 
04:09:07.429 --> 04:09:07.439 align:start position:0%
to have representation in court there
 
04:09:10.070 --> 04:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
are apparently considered a substandard
 
04:09:12.710 --> 04:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
class of citizens and I think that's
 
04:09:12.720 --> 04:09:14.330 align:start position:0%
class of citizens and I think that's
offensive

04:09:14.330 --> 04:09:14.340 align:start position:0%
offensive
 
04:09:14.340 --> 04:09:15.590 align:start position:0%
offensive
okay

04:09:15.590 --> 04:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:09:18.830 --> 04:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
a 15 year old is very capable of sharing
 
04:09:21.769 --> 04:09:21.779 align:start position:0%
how they feel about what's going on in
 
04:09:25.189 --> 04:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:27.530 --> 04:09:27.540 align:start position:0%
why can't they get access to counsel
 
04:09:30.170 --> 04:09:30.180 align:start position:0%
well they can't pay for it well how do
 
04:09:31.490 --> 04:09:31.500 align:start position:0%
we deal with that with the rest of
 
04:09:33.170 --> 04:09:33.180 align:start position:0%
society if the person can't pay for a
 
04:09:35.389 --> 04:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
council we at the state level provide
 
04:09:39.050 --> 04:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:41.210 --> 04:09:41.220 align:start position:0%
now this is different for a two-year-old
 
04:09:43.910 --> 04:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
I understand that but in this case we
 
04:09:47.090 --> 04:09:47.100 align:start position:0%
don't okay we have Casa volunteers we
 
04:09:51.590 --> 04:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
appoint gals but the there is no one who
 
04:09:54.050 --> 04:09:54.060 align:start position:0%
is actually arguing on behalf of the
 
04:09:56.510 --> 04:09:56.520 align:start position:0%
child's wishes themselves the casa can
 
04:09:58.309 --> 04:09:58.319 align:start position:0%
do their best job but they're not
 
04:10:00.590 --> 04:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
obligated to represent
 
04:10:03.170 --> 04:10:03.180 align:start position:0%
the child's wishes they're obligated by
 
04:10:05.689 --> 04:10:05.699 align:start position:0%
Statute today to represent what they
 
04:10:07.370 --> 04:10:07.380 align:start position:0%
think is the best interest of the child
 
04:10:11.269 --> 04:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:13.309 --> 04:10:13.319 align:start position:0%
the child is really without any counsel
 
04:10:14.990 --> 04:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
and then the one place that it does show
 
04:10:17.210 --> 04:10:17.220 align:start position:0%
up in our statutes is that the
 
04:10:19.370 --> 04:10:19.380 align:start position:0%
dispositional hearing well we're pretty
 
04:10:21.469 --> 04:10:21.479 align:start position:0%
far down the process and if this is a
 
04:10:23.870 --> 04:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
reassignment from a family to a foster
 
04:10:23.880 --> 04:10:25.070 align:start position:0%
reassignment from a family to a foster
family

04:10:25.070 --> 04:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
family
 
04:10:27.410 --> 04:10:27.420 align:start position:0%
or from one parent to another there
 
04:10:30.110 --> 04:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
could be a lot of a lot of situations
 
04:10:32.210 --> 04:10:32.220 align:start position:0%
the child really doesn't get any say
 
04:10:34.130 --> 04:10:34.140 align:start position:0%
they just
 
04:10:36.050 --> 04:10:36.060 align:start position:0%
get shoved around and I don't think
 
04:10:38.030 --> 04:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
that's fair so
 
04:10:40.910 --> 04:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
the issue here is a lot of states have
 
04:10:43.429 --> 04:10:43.439 align:start position:0%
started to go down the process where the
 
04:10:46.010 --> 04:10:46.020 align:start position:0%
child is entitled to legal counsel to
 
04:10:48.290 --> 04:10:48.300 align:start position:0%
represent their wishes we don't do that
 
04:10:51.229 --> 04:10:51.239 align:start position:0%
even Massachusetts does that I would
 
04:10:52.790 --> 04:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
argue that the best thing we could do
 
04:10:55.969 --> 04:10:55.979 align:start position:0%
and maybe it's not for all ages I can I
 
04:10:57.710 --> 04:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
can have that conversation right there's
 
04:10:59.269 --> 04:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
a big difference between a five-year-old
 
04:11:02.150 --> 04:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
and a 15 year old in terms of being able
 
04:11:03.710 --> 04:11:03.720 align:start position:0%
to represent their views and
 
04:11:06.229 --> 04:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
understanding what's going on
 
04:11:09.469 --> 04:11:09.479 align:start position:0%
but by the time we get to a teenager
 
04:11:11.510 --> 04:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
they should have their say they should
 
04:11:13.490 --> 04:11:13.500 align:start position:0%
be allowed to discuss what's going on
 
04:11:14.929 --> 04:11:14.939 align:start position:0%
and how it impacts their lives because
 
04:11:16.490 --> 04:11:16.500 align:start position:0%
no matter what happens at the end of the
 
04:11:18.349 --> 04:11:18.359 align:start position:0%
day the decisions that the court is
 
04:11:20.090 --> 04:11:20.100 align:start position:0%
making the decisions that all the other
 
04:11:22.250 --> 04:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
interested parties are making
 
04:11:25.490 --> 04:11:25.500 align:start position:0%
affects them significantly so they
 
04:11:27.290 --> 04:11:27.300 align:start position:0%
should have their say in court
 
04:11:28.610 --> 04:11:28.620 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
04:11:30.889 --> 04:11:30.899 align:start position:0%
thank you for your presentation I have a
 
04:11:34.389 --> 04:11:34.399 align:start position:0%
question here in section
 
04:11:36.830 --> 04:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
Roman 2
 
04:11:36.840 --> 04:11:38.090 align:start position:0%
Roman 2
yeah

04:11:38.090 --> 04:11:38.100 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:11:41.870 --> 04:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
um after the strikeout the court May
 
04:11:45.110 --> 04:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
appoint an attorney go down four more
 
04:11:48.170 --> 04:11:48.180 align:start position:0%
lines in addition the court May appoint
 
04:11:50.870 --> 04:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
an attorney but then go down to the
 
04:11:54.170 --> 04:11:54.180 align:start position:0%
bottom of the page under 490 d3a
 
04:11:58.130 --> 04:11:58.140 align:start position:0%
shall be entitled to representation how
 
04:12:00.410 --> 04:12:00.420 align:start position:0%
do you harmonize the court may do it
 
04:12:03.290 --> 04:12:03.300 align:start position:0%
with the court better do it so this is a
 
04:12:04.670 --> 04:12:04.680 align:start position:0%
great question
 
04:12:06.650 --> 04:12:06.660 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure I was not the only
 
04:12:09.710 --> 04:12:09.720 align:start position:0%
legislator who put in an LSR who in the
 
04:12:11.630 --> 04:12:11.640 align:start position:0%
week between Christmas and New Year saw
 
04:12:15.110 --> 04:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
various redrafts and whatever and oh
 
04:12:17.269 --> 04:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
please sign off before we get this bill
 
04:12:19.490 --> 04:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
done and I'm not blaming them they they
 
04:12:23.630 --> 04:12:23.640 align:start position:0%
had a huge number of requests but this I
 
04:12:25.070 --> 04:12:25.080 align:start position:0%
think we need to do a scrub of the
 
04:12:26.630 --> 04:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
languages to make sure the shells and
 
04:12:29.750 --> 04:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
Maize are in sync in this case the goal
 
04:12:32.990 --> 04:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
would be if the child the child shall be
 
04:12:35.870 --> 04:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
appointed counsel and
 
04:12:37.729 --> 04:12:37.739 align:start position:0%
um that may cost the state some money
 
04:12:41.090 --> 04:12:41.100 align:start position:0%
but we should allow all citizens access
 
04:12:43.070 --> 04:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
to an attorney to represent their view
 
04:12:45.050 --> 04:12:45.060 align:start position:0%
in court so when you scrub the language
 
04:12:47.210 --> 04:12:47.220 align:start position:0%
and come back with an amendment when we
 
04:12:50.689 --> 04:12:50.699 align:start position:0%
exec this we could assume that the
 
04:12:53.929 --> 04:12:53.939 align:start position:0%
language the court May appoint will be
 
04:12:56.929 --> 04:12:56.939 align:start position:0%
moved to the courtship yes also on page
 
04:13:00.590 --> 04:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
two it talks about fiscal notes again it
 
04:13:02.110 --> 04:13:02.120 align:start position:0%
was a busy time
 
04:13:06.290 --> 04:13:06.300 align:start position:0%
they were not ready has the fiscal notes
 
04:13:07.969 --> 04:13:07.979 align:start position:0%
since come forward I have not seen the
 
04:13:10.370 --> 04:13:10.380 align:start position:0%
fiscal note it is an FN Bill I'm sure
 
04:13:12.050 --> 04:13:12.060 align:start position:0%
it's going to finance because it would
 
04:13:15.229 --> 04:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
impact State spending so that being the
 
04:13:17.210 --> 04:13:17.220 align:start position:0%
case I'm sure it's coming to a second
 
04:13:18.830 --> 04:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
committee this is probably an early bill
 
04:13:21.110 --> 04:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
it's not been given to me as an early
 
04:13:22.969 --> 04:13:22.979 align:start position:0%
bill but I could assume they might
 
04:13:26.389 --> 04:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
change their mind so given the
 
04:13:28.070 --> 04:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
possibility we may have to get it out
 
04:13:30.830 --> 04:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
the door by the middle of February would
 
04:13:32.929 --> 04:13:32.939 align:start position:0%
you come back as soon as you could with
 
04:13:36.170 --> 04:13:36.180 align:start position:0%
an amendment the language based on this
 
04:13:38.830 --> 04:13:38.840 align:start position:0%
and anything else that we might
 
04:13:42.590 --> 04:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely anybody else want to help him
 
04:13:49.969 --> 04:13:49.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:51.830 --> 04:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
04:13:54.110 --> 04:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh you brought up
 
04:13:55.429 --> 04:13:55.439 align:start position:0%
a good point
 
04:13:56.870 --> 04:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
you know appointed attorney for a
 
04:13:56.880 --> 04:13:58.550 align:start position:0%
you know appointed attorney for a
two-year-old

04:13:58.550 --> 04:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
two-year-old
 
04:14:01.250 --> 04:14:01.260 align:start position:0%
um so should
 
04:14:05.870 --> 04:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
we Define that what you know it's a
 
04:14:07.250 --> 04:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
great representative long thank you it's
 
04:14:11.269 --> 04:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
a great question and there is a there is
 
04:14:13.269 --> 04:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
a point where a child has enough
 
04:14:15.469 --> 04:14:15.479 align:start position:0%
capability to be able to make
 
04:14:17.389 --> 04:14:17.399 align:start position:0%
recommendations and understand what's
 
04:14:19.610 --> 04:14:19.620 align:start position:0%
going on and a two-year-old is not at
 
04:14:21.769 --> 04:14:21.779 align:start position:0%
the same place as a 12 year old right
 
04:14:23.689 --> 04:14:23.699 align:start position:0%
there are some guidelines in other
 
04:14:26.210 --> 04:14:26.220 align:start position:0%
statutes about when children are allowed
 
04:14:28.429 --> 04:14:28.439 align:start position:0%
to testify in court for instance I
 
04:14:30.950 --> 04:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
believe that's 13 or 14 I have to go
 
04:14:32.330 --> 04:14:32.340 align:start position:0%
back and look at the statutes there are
 
04:14:35.389 --> 04:14:35.399 align:start position:0%
some other things but
 
04:14:38.269 --> 04:14:38.279 align:start position:0%
um we can we can move the bar from 18
 
04:14:42.830 --> 04:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
down what the right threshold is is
 
04:14:44.510 --> 04:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
clearly something worth debating whether
 
04:14:49.309 --> 04:14:49.319 align:start position:0%
that's 16 14 12 10 8 2 is probably at
 
04:14:51.530 --> 04:14:51.540 align:start position:0%
the other end of the spectrum right
 
04:14:53.269 --> 04:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
um at that point they're not capable of
 
04:14:57.110 --> 04:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
fully taking care of themselves so
 
04:14:59.269 --> 04:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
a window that seems reasonable somewhere
 
04:15:01.130 --> 04:15:01.140 align:start position:0%
between 8 and 14 I don't know what the
 
04:15:02.870 --> 04:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
right number is but there is a point in
 
04:15:05.630 --> 04:15:05.640 align:start position:0%
time where children are cognizant of
 
04:15:08.110 --> 04:15:08.120 align:start position:0%
what's going on around them to make
 
04:15:10.790 --> 04:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
well-informed decisions in something
 
04:15:12.170 --> 04:15:12.180 align:start position:0%
that dramatically is going to impact
 
04:15:15.229 --> 04:15:15.239 align:start position:0%
their life very good thank you
 
04:15:17.809 --> 04:15:17.819 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond
 
04:15:20.150 --> 04:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chairman and thank you
 
04:15:22.189 --> 04:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
representative for being here
 
04:15:26.110 --> 04:15:26.120 align:start position:0%
um are you wanting the court to appoint
 
04:15:28.990 --> 04:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
or have the ability to appoint
 
04:15:32.630 --> 04:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
representation for the child prior to a
 
04:15:36.530 --> 04:15:36.540 align:start position:0%
disposition on a case so currently they
 
04:15:38.330 --> 04:15:38.340 align:start position:0%
get if they're in foster care or
 
04:15:42.950 --> 04:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
whatever they get a casa or you know a
 
04:15:46.010 --> 04:15:46.020 align:start position:0%
parent could get a jail once there is a
 
04:15:47.929 --> 04:15:47.939 align:start position:0%
finding of abuser neglect and a case is
 
04:15:51.050 --> 04:15:51.060 align:start position:0%
opened but up to that point the dcyf
 
04:15:52.610 --> 04:15:52.620 align:start position:0%
hasn't determined the court hasn't
 
04:15:54.349 --> 04:15:54.359 align:start position:0%
determined abuse or neglected so you're
 
04:15:56.630 --> 04:15:56.640 align:start position:0%
asking for representation to them before
 
04:15:59.450 --> 04:15:59.460 align:start position:0%
a case has started so so my
 
04:16:01.429 --> 04:16:01.439 align:start position:0%
understanding of the process having gone
 
04:16:03.290 --> 04:16:03.300 align:start position:0%
and throw it only once I don't claim to
 
04:16:05.210 --> 04:16:05.220 align:start position:0%
be an expert yet
 
04:16:08.870 --> 04:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
um is there is a preliminary hearing and
 
04:16:11.330 --> 04:16:11.340 align:start position:0%
then there's an adjudicatory hearing and
 
04:16:13.010 --> 04:16:13.020 align:start position:0%
then there is a dispositional hearing
 
04:16:13.020 --> 04:16:14.630 align:start position:0%
then there is a dispositional hearing
yes

04:16:14.630 --> 04:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:16:16.849 --> 04:16:16.859 align:start position:0%
um clearly by the adjudicatory hearing
 
04:16:18.830 --> 04:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
the child should have representation
 
04:16:20.450 --> 04:16:20.460 align:start position:0%
because that's where the facts of what's
 
04:16:25.070 --> 04:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
going on are discussed and the child may
 
04:16:27.650 --> 04:16:27.660 align:start position:0%
have information that would be relevant
 
04:16:30.050 --> 04:16:30.060 align:start position:0%
to the adjudication decision as opposed
 
04:16:32.210 --> 04:16:32.220 align:start position:0%
to just the dispositional this is
 
04:16:33.889 --> 04:16:33.899 align:start position:0%
drafted all the way back to the
 
04:16:36.469 --> 04:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
preliminary hearing because that's where
 
04:16:38.510 --> 04:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
in our personal case
 
04:16:40.610 --> 04:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to I don't want the
 
04:16:42.170 --> 04:16:42.180 align:start position:0%
bill to be about our personal case but
 
04:16:44.030 --> 04:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
that's where the case went off the rail
 
04:16:46.849 --> 04:16:46.859 align:start position:0%
significantly okay
 
04:16:48.950 --> 04:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
um and a little bit of additional
 
04:16:50.450 --> 04:16:50.460 align:start position:0%
information in that hearing would have
 
04:16:52.370 --> 04:16:52.380 align:start position:0%
been very different
 
04:16:52.380 --> 04:16:52.969 align:start position:0%
been very different
um

04:16:52.969 --> 04:16:52.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:57.830 --> 04:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
so I think it's worthwhile that there at
 
04:17:00.290 --> 04:17:00.300 align:start position:0%
least be the door opened for at the
 
04:17:01.849 --> 04:17:01.859 align:start position:0%
preliminary hearing but definitely move
 
04:17:03.889 --> 04:17:03.899 align:start position:0%
the bar back from dispositional to the
 
04:17:06.229 --> 04:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
adjudicatory face and quick follow-up
 
04:17:06.239 --> 04:17:07.610 align:start position:0%
adjudicatory face and quick follow-up
follow-up

04:17:07.610 --> 04:17:07.620 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:17:10.189 --> 04:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
um I'm five years out of date Now with
 
04:17:14.210 --> 04:17:14.220 align:start position:0%
uh and Casa so I apologize but back when
 
04:17:17.150 --> 04:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
I was involved in DCF and Casa there was
 
04:17:20.210 --> 04:17:20.220 align:start position:0%
the youth and Court protocols where
 
04:17:23.750 --> 04:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
um children were invited to all of the
 
04:17:25.729 --> 04:17:25.739 align:start position:0%
Court hearings and I I know that that
 
04:17:27.050 --> 04:17:27.060 align:start position:0%
was happening because I drove some
 
04:17:29.630 --> 04:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
myself and had an opportunity to speak
 
04:17:31.670 --> 04:17:31.680 align:start position:0%
to judge like pretty much whenever they
 
04:17:33.050 --> 04:17:33.060 align:start position:0%
want or otherwise meaningfully
 
04:17:35.570 --> 04:17:35.580 align:start position:0%
participate by writing a letter or I
 
04:17:36.710 --> 04:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
mean we had two-year-olds drawing
 
04:17:39.469 --> 04:17:39.479 align:start position:0%
pictures for the judge is that not
 
04:17:42.050 --> 04:17:42.060 align:start position:0%
happening now so my understanding the
 
04:17:44.510 --> 04:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
rules are slightly different and there
 
04:17:47.389 --> 04:17:47.399 align:start position:0%
is a provision I believe it's 13
 
04:17:50.269 --> 04:17:50.279 align:start position:0%
um the dcif worker or the rate we can
 
04:17:51.349 --> 04:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
find out from
 
04:17:52.910 --> 04:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
um with the committee researcher but
 
04:17:55.130 --> 04:17:55.140 align:start position:0%
there is a threshold and it's either 13
 
04:17:58.010 --> 04:17:58.020 align:start position:0%
or 14 before the child is entitled to be
 
04:17:59.570 --> 04:17:59.580 align:start position:0%
appear in court for the first time so
 
04:18:02.809 --> 04:18:02.819 align:start position:0%
the there's now a Prohibition there you
 
04:18:04.910 --> 04:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
can set up
 
04:18:04.920 --> 04:18:05.809 align:start position:0%
can set up
um

04:18:05.809 --> 04:18:05.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:07.969 --> 04:18:07.979 align:start position:0%
and forgive me I don't know the legal
 
04:18:10.610 --> 04:18:10.620 align:start position:0%
term but an appearance with the judge
 
04:18:10.620 --> 04:18:12.769 align:start position:0%
term but an appearance with the judge
directly

04:18:12.769 --> 04:18:12.779 align:start position:0%
directly
 
04:18:12.779 --> 04:18:16.250 align:start position:0%
directly
um

04:18:16.250 --> 04:18:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:19.429 --> 04:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
we actually petitioned for said thing
 
04:18:22.729 --> 04:18:22.739 align:start position:0%
dcyf came back and said no
 
04:18:25.670 --> 04:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
and it would be front page news if I use
 
04:18:28.309 --> 04:18:28.319 align:start position:0%
the language they said
 
04:18:31.849 --> 04:18:31.859 align:start position:0%
um about their reasons it was it was
 
04:18:31.859 --> 04:18:32.990 align:start position:0%
um about their reasons it was it was
appalling

04:18:32.990 --> 04:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
appalling
 
04:18:33.000 --> 04:18:34.429 align:start position:0%
appalling
so

04:18:34.429 --> 04:18:34.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:18:37.010 --> 04:18:37.020 align:start position:0%
allowing the child
 
04:18:38.929 --> 04:18:38.939 align:start position:0%
they're a person at the end of the day
 
04:18:41.389 --> 04:18:41.399 align:start position:0%
we we should protect the children in the
 
04:18:43.910 --> 04:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
state to the best of our ability if a
 
04:18:45.469 --> 04:18:45.479 align:start position:0%
child says
 
04:18:47.630 --> 04:18:47.640 align:start position:0%
I don't think this is fair there's
 
04:18:50.210 --> 04:18:50.220 align:start position:0%
something wrong I want to talk to the
 
04:18:52.490 --> 04:18:52.500 align:start position:0%
judge we should make sure that happens
 
04:18:56.929 --> 04:18:56.939 align:start position:0%
in any any way possible and in our case
 
04:18:59.990 --> 04:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
that couldn't happen
 
04:19:01.849 --> 04:19:01.859 align:start position:0%
um rarely do you get to file a piece of
 
04:19:01.859 --> 04:19:03.769 align:start position:0%
um rarely do you get to file a piece of
legislation

04:19:03.769 --> 04:19:03.779 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:19:05.689 --> 04:19:05.699 align:start position:0%
for a family member but in this case
 
04:19:07.250 --> 04:19:07.260 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm a little emotional I do
 
04:19:10.550 --> 04:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
because I watch firsthand the trauma
 
04:19:13.070 --> 04:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
okay that my child experienced through
 
04:19:15.710 --> 04:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
all of this because he was denied access
 
04:19:21.170 --> 04:19:21.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:25.070 --> 04:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:26.570 --> 04:19:26.580 align:start position:0%
any further questions for the
 
04:19:29.030 --> 04:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
representative thank you
 
04:19:31.370 --> 04:19:31.380 align:start position:0%
my suggestion is since you have to go
 
04:19:34.550 --> 04:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
testify in another committee that if
 
04:19:36.349 --> 04:19:36.359 align:start position:0%
driving home tonight we get this
 
04:19:38.750 --> 04:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
brainstorm that begins with oh I should
 
04:19:40.969 --> 04:19:40.979 align:start position:0%
have asked him
 
04:19:43.309 --> 04:19:43.319 align:start position:0%
um would you welcome them to email or
 
04:19:44.689 --> 04:19:44.699 align:start position:0%
call you absolutely while you're
 
04:19:46.790 --> 04:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
undergoing your little Bill scrubbing
 
04:19:49.309 --> 04:19:49.319 align:start position:0%
absolutely so please contact me we can
 
04:19:51.830 --> 04:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
add some of our wisdom okay good thank
 
04:19:53.090 --> 04:19:53.100 align:start position:0%
you everyone
 
04:19:57.290 --> 04:19:57.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:01.849 --> 04:20:01.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:04.490 --> 04:20:04.500 align:start position:0%
that's Norwegian isn't it
 
04:20:06.170 --> 04:20:06.180 align:start position:0%
actually Scottish
 
04:20:09.830 --> 04:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
well I'm Scottish and I know where a lot
 
04:20:12.650 --> 04:20:12.660 align:start position:0%
of my ancestors came from is from Norway
 
04:20:12.660 --> 04:20:14.150 align:start position:0%
of my ancestors came from is from Norway
so

04:20:14.150 --> 04:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:20:17.269 --> 04:20:17.279 align:start position:0%
I am actually Norwegian marjison is my
 
04:20:19.250 --> 04:20:19.260 align:start position:0%
husband's name whoa but he is not
 
04:20:19.260 --> 04:20:22.130 align:start position:0%
husband's name whoa but he is not
Norwegian

04:20:22.130 --> 04:20:22.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:25.250 --> 04:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
so as I understand it it's Scottish but
 
04:20:28.030 --> 04:20:28.040 align:start position:0%
but we'll have to talk later exactly
 
04:20:31.729 --> 04:20:31.739 align:start position:0%
so again uh thank you chair Vice chair
 
04:20:32.809 --> 04:20:32.819 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee for
 
04:20:34.729 --> 04:20:34.739 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak here today I am
 
04:20:36.830 --> 04:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
Beth margison either Norwegian or
 
04:20:40.429 --> 04:20:40.439 align:start position:0%
Scottish and I am here on behalf of dcyf
 
04:20:43.429 --> 04:20:43.439 align:start position:0%
to provide testimony on this bill
 
04:20:44.929 --> 04:20:44.939 align:start position:0%
um a couple of things just sort of
 
04:20:47.469 --> 04:20:47.479 align:start position:0%
working backwards again uh
 
04:20:50.150 --> 04:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
representative Poole is is correct in
 
04:20:50.160 --> 04:20:51.050 align:start position:0%
representative Poole is is correct in
that

04:20:51.050 --> 04:20:51.060 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:20:51.060 --> 04:20:51.889 align:start position:0%
that
um

04:20:51.889 --> 04:20:51.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:51.899 --> 04:20:52.690 align:start position:0%
um
the

04:20:52.690 --> 04:20:52.700 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:20:52.700 --> 04:20:54.229 align:start position:0%
the
[Music]

04:20:54.229 --> 04:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:20:54.239 --> 04:20:55.610 align:start position:0%
[Music]
children

04:20:55.610 --> 04:20:55.620 align:start position:0%
children
 
04:20:57.290 --> 04:20:57.300 align:start position:0%
or perhaps it was you representative
 
04:20:59.570 --> 04:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
Raymond I'm mature but uh according to
 
04:21:01.250 --> 04:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
protocols that were developed between
 
04:21:03.590 --> 04:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
Casa and other people in the model core
 
04:21:06.830 --> 04:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
project children 14 and above in the
 
04:21:09.410 --> 04:21:09.420 align:start position:0%
dispositional phrase going forward can
 
04:21:11.630 --> 04:21:11.640 align:start position:0%
speak to the judge directly and that can
 
04:21:13.969 --> 04:21:13.979 align:start position:0%
sometimes be off the record with their
 
04:21:16.010 --> 04:21:16.020 align:start position:0%
Casa present tell the judge anything
 
04:21:18.769 --> 04:21:18.779 align:start position:0%
that they speak want to or they can
 
04:21:20.510 --> 04:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
speak directly in open court it's
 
04:21:22.969 --> 04:21:22.979 align:start position:0%
generally up to the judge to decide how
 
04:21:25.670 --> 04:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
he wants to take that testimony and also
 
04:21:27.889 --> 04:21:27.899 align:start position:0%
yes children as young as two can send
 
04:21:29.809 --> 04:21:29.819 align:start position:0%
pictures and
 
04:21:32.030 --> 04:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
um information to the judge to tell them
 
04:21:35.150 --> 04:21:35.160 align:start position:0%
how they're doing I think the consensus
 
04:21:37.550 --> 04:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
was the 14 was probably the youngest age
 
04:21:39.290 --> 04:21:39.300 align:start position:0%
it was children it is important for
 
04:21:40.849 --> 04:21:40.859 align:start position:0%
children to have voice in court and
 
04:21:42.849 --> 04:21:42.859 align:start position:0%
proceedings but that they had reached a
 
04:21:45.650 --> 04:21:45.660 align:start position:0%
physician sufficient maturity to speak
 
04:21:48.889 --> 04:21:48.899 align:start position:0%
in court at that age and notably the age
 
04:21:51.170 --> 04:21:51.180 align:start position:0%
of consent for adoption for a child is
 
04:21:53.050 --> 04:21:53.060 align:start position:0%
also 14 years
 
04:21:55.550 --> 04:21:55.560 align:start position:0%
the division would have a lot of
 
04:21:57.349 --> 04:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
concerns about having a child present
 
04:21:59.590 --> 04:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
during an adjudicatory hearing
 
04:22:03.110 --> 04:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
the division has never called the child
 
04:22:04.570 --> 04:22:04.580 align:start position:0%
to the witness in any kind of
 
04:22:07.189 --> 04:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
adjudicatory hearing I remember one
 
04:22:09.650 --> 04:22:09.660 align:start position:0%
child was asked to testify and a judge
 
04:22:13.030 --> 04:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
would not allow It ultimately who is
 
04:22:15.830 --> 04:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
allowed to speak in a courtroom is up to
 
04:22:18.769 --> 04:22:18.779 align:start position:0%
a judge but in general children do have
 
04:22:21.170 --> 04:22:21.180 align:start position:0%
a voice when they are over 14 years from
 
04:22:25.849 --> 04:22:25.859 align:start position:0%
the dispositional phase of the case on
 
04:22:27.830 --> 04:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
um as to the the merits of the
 
04:22:27.840 --> 04:22:29.510 align:start position:0%
um as to the the merits of the
legislation

04:22:29.510 --> 04:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:22:31.490 --> 04:22:31.500 align:start position:0%
um representative who is right that New
 
04:22:33.830 --> 04:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is but one of a few states
 
04:22:35.630 --> 04:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
that do not have representation for
 
04:22:35.640 --> 04:22:36.429 align:start position:0%
that do not have representation for
children

04:22:36.429 --> 04:22:36.439 align:start position:0%
children
 
04:22:39.229 --> 04:22:39.239 align:start position:0%
the vision is not necessarily opposed to
 
04:22:42.290 --> 04:22:42.300 align:start position:0%
that not opposed to providing
 
04:22:45.530 --> 04:22:45.540 align:start position:0%
representation for children our concerns
 
04:22:47.990 --> 04:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
are is that it would be extremely
 
04:22:50.750 --> 04:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
expensive the pool of attorneys that
 
04:22:52.130 --> 04:22:52.140 align:start position:0%
would likely be able to work with
 
04:22:56.929 --> 04:22:56.939 align:start position:0%
children would be somewhat uh small and
 
04:22:58.670 --> 04:22:58.680 align:start position:0%
there would be a lot of conflict with
 
04:23:01.010 --> 04:23:01.020 align:start position:0%
parents attorneys and that parents
 
04:23:02.689 --> 04:23:02.699 align:start position:0%
attorneys would also be representing
 
04:23:05.389 --> 04:23:05.399 align:start position:0%
individuals in the same case so you
 
04:23:06.950 --> 04:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
would probably see a lot of conflicts in
 
04:23:09.590 --> 04:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
their interest it would cost quite a bit
 
04:23:12.550 --> 04:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
of money again we're not opposed to that
 
04:23:15.769 --> 04:23:15.779 align:start position:0%
but we think that in terms of the money
 
04:23:18.830 --> 04:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
that we need to to build up our system
 
04:23:21.290 --> 04:23:21.300 align:start position:0%
and improve it at this time that money
 
04:23:23.030 --> 04:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
probably would be better spent on
 
04:23:24.950 --> 04:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
assessment treatment and services for
 
04:23:27.410 --> 04:23:27.420 align:start position:0%
children in but it is correct and as the
 
04:23:29.389 --> 04:23:29.399 align:start position:0%
committee your committee researcher has
 
04:23:32.689 --> 04:23:32.699 align:start position:0%
noted in her in her materials which I
 
04:23:34.130 --> 04:23:34.140 align:start position:0%
haven't had a chance to go through we
 
04:23:36.170 --> 04:23:36.180 align:start position:0%
are but one of a few states that do not
 
04:23:38.650 --> 04:23:38.660 align:start position:0%
represent children to have appoint
 
04:23:41.330 --> 04:23:41.340 align:start position:0%
attorneys for children
 
04:23:44.630 --> 04:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
another issue with the with the uh
 
04:23:47.330 --> 04:23:47.340 align:start position:0%
legislations that is drafted is that
 
04:23:48.889 --> 04:23:48.899 align:start position:0%
where the child's expressed interest
 
04:23:51.710 --> 04:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
conflict with any recommendation we're
 
04:23:54.050 --> 04:23:54.060 align:start position:0%
concerned that this could be this could
 
04:23:56.570 --> 04:23:56.580 align:start position:0%
be potentially trivial things which are
 
04:23:58.429 --> 04:23:58.439 align:start position:0%
big things to a child
 
04:24:01.550 --> 04:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
limitations on cell phone use curfew use
 
04:24:04.189 --> 04:24:04.199 align:start position:0%
that this could perhaps
 
04:24:06.110 --> 04:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
first of all it would probably certainly
 
04:24:09.469 --> 04:24:09.479 align:start position:0%
create more litigation but that every
 
04:24:12.830 --> 04:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
single aspect of where the child wants
 
04:24:15.349 --> 04:24:15.359 align:start position:0%
to do something would become a you know
 
04:24:17.870 --> 04:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
a lawsuit based not a lawsuit but it
 
04:24:20.990 --> 04:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
would actually create litigation it
 
04:24:23.330 --> 04:24:23.340 align:start position:0%
would prolong permanency it would make
 
04:24:26.330 --> 04:24:26.340 align:start position:0%
for a very difficult case to to
 
04:24:28.790 --> 04:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
um to handle going forward you know
 
04:24:31.070 --> 04:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
again dispositional orders
 
04:24:33.290 --> 04:24:33.300 align:start position:0%
um the the bigger portions of the case
 
04:24:35.630 --> 04:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
the bigger parts of the case placement
 
04:24:38.349 --> 04:24:38.359 align:start position:0%
Treatment Services psycho valves
 
04:24:41.090 --> 04:24:41.100 align:start position:0%
uh visitation with parents and whatnot
 
04:24:42.830 --> 04:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
those are things that are routinely
 
04:24:45.050 --> 04:24:45.060 align:start position:0%
hashed out in court not only the
 
04:24:47.269 --> 04:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
dispositional hearing but at the three
 
04:24:49.490 --> 04:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
six and nine month hearings prior to
 
04:24:51.769 --> 04:24:51.779 align:start position:0%
getting to the permanency hearing at
 
04:24:54.229 --> 04:24:54.239 align:start position:0%
that point the child is represented by a
 
04:24:57.530 --> 04:24:57.540 align:start position:0%
gal no I'm sorry the child does have a
 
04:25:01.370 --> 04:25:01.380 align:start position:0%
gal or a casa appointed to the child to
 
04:25:03.290 --> 04:25:03.300 align:start position:0%
represent their best was it with their
 
04:25:05.210 --> 04:25:05.220 align:start position:0%
best interests
 
04:25:05.220 --> 04:25:05.809 align:start position:0%
best interests
um

04:25:05.809 --> 04:25:05.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:07.610 --> 04:25:07.620 align:start position:0%
I think that's about all we have to say
 
04:25:10.490 --> 04:25:10.500 align:start position:0%
on the legislation if I'm here to take
 
04:25:13.790 --> 04:25:13.800 align:start position:0%
any questions if anyone has them
 
04:25:16.309 --> 04:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
representative long thank you Mr
 
04:25:16.319 --> 04:25:17.269 align:start position:0%
representative long thank you Mr
chairman

04:25:17.269 --> 04:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
04:25:20.630 --> 04:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
do you ever recommend recommended age
 
04:25:24.710 --> 04:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
If This Were to pass at what
 
04:25:27.950 --> 04:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
I I I don't I don't think you can put an
 
04:25:29.269 --> 04:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
age on it because I don't think other
 
04:25:31.490 --> 04:25:31.500 align:start position:0%
states have put an age on it
 
04:25:33.469 --> 04:25:33.479 align:start position:0%
um I think you either appoint attorneys
 
04:25:35.870 --> 04:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
for children or or you don't all right
 
04:25:35.880 --> 04:25:40.689 align:start position:0%
for children or or you don't all right
thanks

04:25:40.689 --> 04:25:40.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:44.389 --> 04:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
yes representative ball
 
04:25:46.250 --> 04:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:25:48.469 --> 04:25:48.479 align:start position:0%
um a question about the casa is it
 
04:25:50.630 --> 04:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
possible for the casa to represent both
 
04:25:54.530 --> 04:25:54.540 align:start position:0%
issues the issue of what the child would
 
04:25:57.649 --> 04:25:57.659 align:start position:0%
like versus the um what the casa would
 
04:25:59.630 --> 04:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
like so that they could present both
 
04:26:01.790 --> 04:26:01.800 align:start position:0%
sides of the issue because the casa does
 
04:26:03.950 --> 04:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
spend a lot of time with the child and
 
04:26:06.050 --> 04:26:06.060 align:start position:0%
I'm sure they've talked about what the
 
04:26:07.670 --> 04:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
child wants worth
 
04:26:09.649 --> 04:26:09.659 align:start position:0%
versus what the cost of fields would be
 
04:26:11.450 --> 04:26:11.460 align:start position:0%
in the child's best interest I'm a
 
04:26:12.649 --> 04:26:12.659 align:start position:0%
little reluctant to answer that because
 
04:26:15.349 --> 04:26:15.359 align:start position:0%
I don't represent Casa in general I will
 
04:26:17.269 --> 04:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
say it cost us here okay good if I found
 
04:26:20.750 --> 04:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
a casa over your left shoulder nodding
 
04:26:23.149 --> 04:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
up and down and she were to fill out a
 
04:26:25.370 --> 04:26:25.380 align:start position:0%
pink card could we take her expert
 
04:26:27.950 --> 04:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
testimony I would defer to the expert
 
04:26:30.830 --> 04:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
testimony of Casa I was a casa just so
 
04:26:32.630 --> 04:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
you know that's why I'm asking because
 
04:26:34.010 --> 04:26:34.020 align:start position:0%
it seems like it would have been a
 
04:26:46.809 --> 04:26:46.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:49.130 --> 04:26:49.140 align:start position:0%
stretch it out while she's filling out
 
04:26:51.530 --> 04:26:51.540 align:start position:0%
her card okay
 
04:26:55.130 --> 04:26:55.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:56.990 --> 04:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
I think that's all I can do Mr well you
 
04:26:59.510 --> 04:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
know yeah I kind of I can fill some time
 
04:26:59.520 --> 04:27:00.530 align:start position:0%
know yeah I kind of I can fill some time
in

04:27:00.530 --> 04:27:00.540 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:27:03.290 --> 04:27:03.300 align:start position:0%
um given the fact a lot of states listed
 
04:27:06.050 --> 04:27:06.060 align:start position:0%
as doing this are states that we could
 
04:27:06.060 --> 04:27:07.990 align:start position:0%
as doing this are states that we could
call

04:27:07.990 --> 04:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
call
 
04:27:12.889 --> 04:27:12.899 align:start position:0%
impecunious or stingy or frugal
 
04:27:14.809 --> 04:27:14.819 align:start position:0%
they seem to have found the money to
 
04:27:17.809 --> 04:27:17.819 align:start position:0%
make it possible so I wonder how much
 
04:27:21.349 --> 04:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
money this would actually cost after all
 
04:27:23.269 --> 04:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
I don't know we don't have a fiscal note
 
04:27:25.969 --> 04:27:25.979 align:start position:0%
on the bill so I I actually I really
 
04:27:28.429 --> 04:27:28.439 align:start position:0%
don't know okay
 
04:27:32.149 --> 04:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes
 
04:27:36.410 --> 04:27:36.420 align:start position:0%
the person who is signing the pink card
 
04:27:38.450 --> 04:27:38.460 align:start position:0%
and is handing it to representative
 
04:27:38.460 --> 04:27:40.010 align:start position:0%
and is handing it to representative
Bickford

04:27:40.010 --> 04:27:40.020 align:start position:0%
Bickford
 
04:27:43.070 --> 04:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
who is walking it up to me
 
04:27:45.950 --> 04:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
and um if we could vacate the seat just
 
04:27:45.960 --> 04:27:53.450 align:start position:0%
and um if we could vacate the seat just
momentarily

04:27:53.450 --> 04:27:53.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:56.450 --> 04:27:56.460 align:start position:0%
thank you and I apologize we recognize
 
04:27:59.750 --> 04:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
Marcia sink from Manchester to speak to
 
04:28:02.870 --> 04:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
the question yes um thank you for the
 
04:28:02.880 --> 04:28:03.950 align:start position:0%
the question yes um thank you for the
opportunity

04:28:03.950 --> 04:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
04:28:06.349 --> 04:28:06.359 align:start position:0%
um I'm Marcia sink I'm the CEO of Casa
 
04:28:08.689 --> 04:28:08.699 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and
 
04:28:12.010 --> 04:28:12.020 align:start position:0%
um to fill in a couple of the blanks
 
04:28:15.349 --> 04:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
there is uh there are Court protocols
 
04:28:18.229 --> 04:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
that allow any child to attend court and
 
04:28:21.469 --> 04:28:21.479 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to say that our judges are
 
04:28:23.870 --> 04:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
encouraging and inviting children to
 
04:28:25.910 --> 04:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
attend their Court hearings and it would
 
04:28:27.950 --> 04:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
be as as
 
04:28:31.210 --> 04:28:31.220 align:start position:0%
attorney Martin represented it is after
 
04:28:34.370 --> 04:28:34.380 align:start position:0%
the dispositional phase of the hearing
 
04:28:36.590 --> 04:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
so it is during those review hearings
 
04:28:39.170 --> 04:28:39.180 align:start position:0%
when a child can be invited to attend
 
04:28:41.870 --> 04:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
the court hearing also it under the
 
04:28:44.689 --> 04:28:44.699 align:start position:0%
guardian ad litem rules any gal whether
 
04:28:47.750 --> 04:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
it's a casa or a pay gal is obligated to
 
04:28:50.149 --> 04:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
bring to the Court's attention when the
 
04:28:53.630 --> 04:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
child's wishes are in direct conflict
 
04:28:56.030 --> 04:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
with their best interest and we are
 
04:28:58.729 --> 04:28:58.739 align:start position:0%
required to do that under again the
 
04:29:02.030 --> 04:29:02.040 align:start position:0%
guardian ad litem rules so there is that
 
04:29:04.670 --> 04:29:04.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the court to be made
 
04:29:08.149 --> 04:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
aware at any point in time what the
 
04:29:11.630 --> 04:29:11.640 align:start position:0%
child's best what their wishes are there
 
04:29:13.070 --> 04:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
is also the opportunity for the
 
04:29:15.290 --> 04:29:15.300 align:start position:0%
appointment of an attorney for those
 
04:29:18.530 --> 04:29:18.540 align:start position:0%
children if the court determines that it
 
04:29:21.590 --> 04:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
is necessary so we have right now about
 
04:29:25.070 --> 04:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
20 cases on our caseload which our
 
04:29:27.889 --> 04:29:27.899 align:start position:0%
caseload right now is 639
 
04:29:30.189 --> 04:29:30.199 align:start position:0%
Active Child Abuse and neglect cases
 
04:29:33.110 --> 04:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
there are about 20 cases right now on
 
04:29:35.510 --> 04:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
our caseload where there has been an
 
04:29:37.790 --> 04:29:37.800 align:start position:0%
attorney appointed for the child for a
 
04:29:39.830 --> 04:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
variety of reasons and
 
04:29:42.710 --> 04:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
um but that's that's at the request of
 
04:29:45.229 --> 04:29:45.239 align:start position:0%
the typically of the casa Guardian Ad
 
04:29:47.510 --> 04:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
Litem or other guardian ad litem
 
04:29:51.110 --> 04:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
and yet that being granted we are
 
04:29:54.010 --> 04:29:54.020 align:start position:0%
colored white in this map one of the few
 
04:29:57.710 --> 04:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
so although let's stipulate all of those
 
04:30:01.370 --> 04:30:01.380 align:start position:0%
things are true what what could we do
 
04:30:03.950 --> 04:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps that we have not been doing in
 
04:30:05.929 --> 04:30:05.939 align:start position:0%
order to change our color on the map if
 
04:30:08.149 --> 04:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
we desired to well I think the resource
 
04:30:10.630 --> 04:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
issue is a huge issue for for the state
 
04:30:12.849 --> 04:30:12.859 align:start position:0%
the way this
 
04:30:15.889 --> 04:30:15.899 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation reads the way I'm
 
04:30:19.070 --> 04:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
reading it is that in fact it's looking
 
04:30:20.750 --> 04:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
for an attorney's attorney appointment
 
04:30:23.030 --> 04:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
for every child who comes into the
 
04:30:25.910 --> 04:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
family court system which goes which is
 
04:30:28.550 --> 04:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
much broader than just those coming in
 
04:30:31.790 --> 04:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
under the 169 C statute which is just
 
04:30:33.950 --> 04:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
the abuse and neglect proceedings so
 
04:30:36.229 --> 04:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
that that opens up number one a huge
 
04:30:38.929 --> 04:30:38.939 align:start position:0%
door to other types of cases marital
 
04:30:42.469 --> 04:30:42.479 align:start position:0%
cases also are heard in the in the um in
 
04:30:45.469 --> 04:30:45.479 align:start position:0%
the family court so but our caseload
 
04:30:47.330 --> 04:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
alone right now we have over over a
 
04:30:50.090 --> 04:30:50.100 align:start position:0%
thousand children on our caseload and
 
04:30:52.429 --> 04:30:52.439 align:start position:0%
again this looks at appointing an
 
04:30:55.490 --> 04:30:55.500 align:start position:0%
attorney for every single child I beg to
 
04:30:58.790 --> 04:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
differ the section 2A of the bill before
 
04:31:02.210 --> 04:31:02.220 align:start position:0%
us in cases involving a neglected or
 
04:31:03.889 --> 04:31:03.899 align:start position:0%
abused child
 
04:31:05.870 --> 04:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
yes it states that in the beginning but
 
04:31:08.269 --> 04:31:08.279 align:start position:0%
I believe it further goes on to
 
04:31:11.170 --> 04:31:11.180 align:start position:0%
um but I could have read it misread it
 
04:31:14.210 --> 04:31:14.220 align:start position:0%
yeah maybe I am too because down in 490
 
04:31:17.269 --> 04:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
d3a in all proceedings in the judicial
 
04:31:19.729 --> 04:31:19.739 align:start position:0%
Family Division
 
04:31:22.490 --> 04:31:22.500 align:start position:0%
a minor child who is the subject of such
 
04:31:25.130 --> 04:31:25.140 align:start position:0%
proceedings which begs definition so
 
04:31:27.050 --> 04:31:27.060 align:start position:0%
that may broaden it
 
04:31:29.689 --> 04:31:29.699 align:start position:0%
um considerably so we may have a
 
04:31:32.149 --> 04:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
conflict possibly there I will give him
 
04:31:35.389 --> 04:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
a call on that let's just say that that
 
04:31:39.050 --> 04:31:39.060 align:start position:0%
is not the case and it's only in cases
 
04:31:41.570 --> 04:31:41.580 align:start position:0%
involving neglected or abused child that
 
04:31:43.130 --> 04:31:43.140 align:start position:0%
should bring the number considerably
 
04:31:46.969 --> 04:31:46.979 align:start position:0%
down correct if if in fact it's we have
 
04:31:50.929 --> 04:31:50.939 align:start position:0%
639 open cases but involved on all those
 
04:31:53.210 --> 04:31:53.220 align:start position:0%
open cases are over a thousand children
 
04:31:53.220 --> 04:31:54.769 align:start position:0%
open cases are over a thousand children
so

04:31:54.769 --> 04:31:54.779 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:31:56.630 --> 04:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
um and again the way
 
04:31:58.490 --> 04:31:58.500 align:start position:0%
we're seeing reading this is that it
 
04:32:00.769 --> 04:32:00.779 align:start position:0%
would be an attorney appointed for each
 
04:32:03.229 --> 04:32:03.239 align:start position:0%
of those individual children and
 
04:32:06.170 --> 04:32:06.180 align:start position:0%
sometimes our sibling groups are
 
04:32:07.910 --> 04:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
um need have very different needs and
 
04:32:10.309 --> 04:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
and desires um the other thing I would
 
04:32:13.849 --> 04:32:13.859 align:start position:0%
say is that the first part which in the
 
04:32:17.809 --> 04:32:17.819 align:start position:0%
um Roman 2 uh the elimination of of the
 
04:32:19.429 --> 04:32:19.439 align:start position:0%
appointment only being able to happen
 
04:32:23.990 --> 04:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
during after the dispositional orders we
 
04:32:26.269 --> 04:32:26.279 align:start position:0%
would ask I mean we would what we would
 
04:32:28.729 --> 04:32:28.739 align:start position:0%
love to see is that broadened that at
 
04:32:31.189 --> 04:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
any point as as they're suggesting here
 
04:32:33.590 --> 04:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
that at any point during the preceding
 
04:32:35.809 --> 04:32:35.819 align:start position:0%
uh the request for an attorney could be
 
04:32:38.389 --> 04:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
made by the guardian ad litem so you
 
04:32:40.070 --> 04:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
would approve of the strikethroughs yes
 
04:32:43.750 --> 04:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:46.370 --> 04:32:46.380 align:start position:0%
representative Levesque
 
04:32:53.389 --> 04:32:53.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:55.969 --> 04:32:55.979 align:start position:0%
with uh it's been mentioned before about
 
04:32:58.550 --> 04:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
kids sending in letters and drawings to
 
04:33:01.370 --> 04:33:01.380 align:start position:0%
the judges has that helped a lot when uh
 
04:33:03.410 --> 04:33:03.420 align:start position:0%
dealing with children's cases like in
 
04:33:05.689 --> 04:33:05.699 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect and helping figure out
 
04:33:07.551 --> 04:33:07.561 align:start position:0%
what's especially for younger kids like
 
04:33:09.650 --> 04:33:09.660 align:start position:0%
what's going on in their mind and seeing
 
04:33:11.570 --> 04:33:11.580 align:start position:0%
that it's been it's been remarkable
 
04:33:11.580 --> 04:33:12.650 align:start position:0%
that it's been it's been remarkable
really

04:33:12.650 --> 04:33:12.660 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:33:14.869 --> 04:33:14.879 align:start position:0%
um how I think one of the the things
 
04:33:17.390 --> 04:33:17.400 align:start position:0%
that we've that's been so powerful is
 
04:33:19.670 --> 04:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
the relationship then between the judge
 
04:33:21.650 --> 04:33:21.660 align:start position:0%
and the child and how
 
04:33:23.869 --> 04:33:23.879 align:start position:0%
um attending court hearing or writing
 
04:33:27.170 --> 04:33:27.180 align:start position:0%
the judge a letter sort of demystifies
 
04:33:29.510 --> 04:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
things for some of our kids
 
04:33:29.520 --> 04:33:30.109 align:start position:0%
things for some of our kids
um

04:33:30.109 --> 04:33:30.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:32.330 --> 04:33:32.340 align:start position:0%
I could share a real quick little story
 
04:33:37.131 --> 04:33:37.141 align:start position:0%
now yes oh okay so we had um we had a
 
04:33:38.631 --> 04:33:38.641 align:start position:0%
six-year-old little boy who was coming
 
04:33:41.269 --> 04:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
home to his foster home and um asking
 
04:33:43.250 --> 04:33:43.260 align:start position:0%
his mum if after school if he could
 
04:33:45.769 --> 04:33:45.779 align:start position:0%
watch Judge Judy on TV this was a while
 
04:33:49.369 --> 04:33:49.379 align:start position:0%
ago and Mom kind of foster mom kind of
 
04:33:50.869 --> 04:33:50.879 align:start position:0%
allowed him to do it for a couple of
 
04:33:52.730 --> 04:33:52.740 align:start position:0%
days and then said but wait a second how
 
04:33:55.330 --> 04:33:55.340 align:start position:0%
about Sesame Street today and he said
 
04:33:58.730 --> 04:33:58.740 align:start position:0%
well I wanna I wanna look for Bob my
 
04:34:02.090 --> 04:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
casa volunteer in the courtroom
 
04:34:04.910 --> 04:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
and so the casa made arrangements for
 
04:34:07.670 --> 04:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
the judge to meet the child and um you
 
04:34:09.230 --> 04:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
know played beanie babies or something
 
04:34:11.090 --> 04:34:11.100 align:start position:0%
on the floor with a child but just but
 
04:34:13.730 --> 04:34:13.740 align:start position:0%
that demystification of and for some of
 
04:34:15.170 --> 04:34:15.180 align:start position:0%
our older children who are given the
 
04:34:17.689 --> 04:34:17.699 align:start position:0%
opportunity to talk to a judge and they
 
04:34:19.910 --> 04:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
feel they've been disempowered by not
 
04:34:22.189 --> 04:34:22.199 align:start position:0%
being able to be present finally
 
04:34:23.810 --> 04:34:23.820 align:start position:0%
um can be there and feel like their
 
04:34:25.970 --> 04:34:25.980 align:start position:0%
voices are truly heard I draw the line
 
04:34:28.010 --> 04:34:28.020 align:start position:0%
at watching Night Court all right yep
 
04:34:30.949 --> 04:34:30.959 align:start position:0%
I'm good with that too yeah it's back by
 
04:34:33.070 --> 04:34:33.080 align:start position:0%
the way yeah
 
04:34:35.750 --> 04:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
have you talked to representative hole
 
04:34:39.230 --> 04:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
about this bill we have not
 
04:34:41.689 --> 04:34:41.699 align:start position:0%
I might suggest it would really kind of
 
04:34:44.869 --> 04:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
improve it if you would okay
 
04:34:44.879 --> 04:34:45.709 align:start position:0%
improve it if you would okay
um

04:34:45.709 --> 04:34:45.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:48.830 --> 04:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to rat you out to him so
 
04:34:52.070 --> 04:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
it's in the book of reps and I think
 
04:34:54.230 --> 04:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
he's on to something here and he told me
 
04:34:56.449 --> 04:34:56.459 align:start position:0%
over the lunch hour that it's a rough
 
04:34:59.150 --> 04:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
draft and he invoked the I'm going to
 
04:35:01.209 --> 04:35:01.219 align:start position:0%
scrub this provision
 
04:35:03.949 --> 04:35:03.959 align:start position:0%
so I think this could really improve it
 
04:35:05.750 --> 04:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
and I think there are there are certain
 
04:35:07.730 --> 04:35:07.740 align:start position:0%
situations and certain types of cases
 
04:35:10.510 --> 04:35:10.520 align:start position:0%
where appointment for a child
 
04:35:13.250 --> 04:35:13.260 align:start position:0%
the division talked about 14 and older
 
04:35:16.609 --> 04:35:16.619 align:start position:0%
or some of our children are youth that
 
04:35:18.349 --> 04:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
are in out of stone out of state
 
04:35:18.359 --> 04:35:20.029 align:start position:0%
are in out of stone out of state
placements

04:35:20.029 --> 04:35:20.039 align:start position:0%
placements
 
04:35:22.670 --> 04:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
um sometimes their voices are ones that
 
04:35:25.250 --> 04:35:25.260 align:start position:0%
could really help and have an attorney
 
04:35:27.650 --> 04:35:27.660 align:start position:0%
who's advocating for them representative
 
04:35:30.890 --> 04:35:30.900 align:start position:0%
D Simone is it for the CEO or for the
 
04:35:33.230 --> 04:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
attorney are you attorney too no okay
 
04:35:36.830 --> 04:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
good the CEO attorney which one I would
 
04:35:41.570 --> 04:35:41.580 align:start position:0%
like to ask the CEO a question please do
 
04:35:44.269 --> 04:35:44.279 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that
 
04:35:46.910 --> 04:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
the younger the child the less apt they
 
04:35:52.010 --> 04:35:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:54.709 --> 04:35:54.719 align:start position:0%
I mean to do two-year-olds know how to
 
04:35:57.890 --> 04:35:57.900 align:start position:0%
lie do one-year-olds know how to lie I'm
 
04:35:59.990 --> 04:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
not a clinician but I'd be hard-pressed
 
04:36:00.000 --> 04:36:01.131 align:start position:0%
not a clinician but I'd be hard-pressed
to

04:36:01.131 --> 04:36:01.141 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:36:04.070 --> 04:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
um unless they've really been coached
 
04:36:07.131 --> 04:36:07.141 align:start position:0%
follow-up please yeah I mean yes you may
 
04:36:11.269 --> 04:36:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:14.810 --> 04:36:14.820 align:start position:0%
as as young as a child is
 
04:36:19.429 --> 04:36:19.439 align:start position:0%
if they were to be appointed an attorney
 
04:36:21.949 --> 04:36:21.959 align:start position:0%
and have the assistance of a casa
 
04:36:26.330 --> 04:36:26.340 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it Aid them Aid the court in
 
04:36:29.269 --> 04:36:29.279 align:start position:0%
determining abuse and neglect to the
 
04:36:34.551 --> 04:36:34.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:38.150 --> 04:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not sure I guess I
 
04:36:40.551 --> 04:36:40.561 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to get at it
 
04:36:43.189 --> 04:36:43.199 align:start position:0%
may I follow up follow up what I'm
 
04:36:46.310 --> 04:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
trying to get at is we've had discussion
 
04:36:49.269 --> 04:36:49.279 align:start position:0%
and questions about age limitations
 
04:36:51.109 --> 04:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
I'm not
 
04:36:53.689 --> 04:36:53.699 align:start position:0%
sure that I'm in tune with an age
 
04:36:56.709 --> 04:36:56.719 align:start position:0%
limitation especially when it comes to
 
04:37:01.010 --> 04:37:01.020 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect and the ability of a
 
04:37:03.529 --> 04:37:03.539 align:start position:0%
very young child to report what's
 
04:37:06.769 --> 04:37:06.779 align:start position:0%
happening to them in a variety of ways
 
04:37:09.349 --> 04:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
they don't have to be able to verbalize
 
04:37:12.830 --> 04:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
yes this is what happened to me they can
 
04:37:16.429 --> 04:37:16.439 align:start position:0%
do it by hand motions
 
04:37:16.439 --> 04:37:18.289 align:start position:0%
do it by hand motions
pictures

04:37:18.289 --> 04:37:18.299 align:start position:0%
pictures
 
04:37:22.090 --> 04:37:22.100 align:start position:0%
whatever is that correct I we don't do
 
04:37:24.830 --> 04:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
investigationary investigative work on
 
04:37:27.650 --> 04:37:27.660 align:start position:0%
our cases that's really dcyf's job so
 
04:37:30.650 --> 04:37:30.660 align:start position:0%
and I'm not a clinician so I'm I'm sort
 
04:37:33.109 --> 04:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
of it's kind of a murky area for me to
 
04:37:34.849 --> 04:37:34.859 align:start position:0%
be entertaining thank you for sure
 
04:37:34.859 --> 04:37:38.570 align:start position:0%
be entertaining thank you for sure
absolutely

04:37:38.570 --> 04:37:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:40.730 --> 04:37:40.740 align:start position:0%
representative long thank you Mr
 
04:37:42.830 --> 04:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for your testimony
 
04:37:47.810 --> 04:37:47.820 align:start position:0%
sure um do you see any duplication of
 
04:37:50.390 --> 04:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
Casa specifically not
 
04:37:52.551 --> 04:37:52.561 align:start position:0%
not a guardian Adel item appointed but
 
04:37:54.230 --> 04:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
it costs are appointed Guardian Apple
 
04:37:54.240 --> 04:37:56.029 align:start position:0%
it costs are appointed Guardian Apple
item

04:37:56.029 --> 04:37:56.039 align:start position:0%
item
 
04:37:58.551 --> 04:37:58.561 align:start position:0%
um or a possible conflict with an
 
04:38:01.789 --> 04:38:01.799 align:start position:0%
attorney of the child because you're the
 
04:38:03.650 --> 04:38:03.660 align:start position:0%
best interest of a child the attorney
 
04:38:06.590 --> 04:38:06.600 align:start position:0%
would be the best interest of the child
 
04:38:10.369 --> 04:38:10.379 align:start position:0%
well do you see where it may conf yeah
 
04:38:12.289 --> 04:38:12.299 align:start position:0%
yeah I guess that there is that a
 
04:38:15.529 --> 04:38:15.539 align:start position:0%
possibility I think um if the if the
 
04:38:17.269 --> 04:38:17.279 align:start position:0%
attorney is appointed as Council for
 
04:38:19.131 --> 04:38:19.141 align:start position:0%
they're really
 
04:38:22.250 --> 04:38:22.260 align:start position:0%
um sharing what the child wants so it's
 
04:38:25.490 --> 04:38:25.500 align:start position:0%
which is can be and can be very
 
04:38:28.010 --> 04:38:28.020 align:start position:0%
different from what the casa would be
 
04:38:29.810 --> 04:38:29.820 align:start position:0%
representing as what's in their best
 
04:38:29.820 --> 04:38:31.310 align:start position:0%
representing as what's in their best
interest

04:38:31.310 --> 04:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
interest
 
04:38:32.990 --> 04:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
um and I think so I think there there is
 
04:38:34.670 --> 04:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
that clear Line in the Sand that should
 
04:38:36.051 --> 04:38:36.061 align:start position:0%
be adhered to
 
04:38:37.910 --> 04:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
um but there may potentially be conflict
 
04:38:40.189 --> 04:38:40.199 align:start position:0%
I would think um thank you and maybe
 
04:38:42.551 --> 04:38:42.561 align:start position:0%
that's part of the point here is that
 
04:38:45.830 --> 04:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
section two in cases involving where the
 
04:38:49.131 --> 04:38:49.141 align:start position:0%
child's expressed interests conflict
 
04:38:51.650 --> 04:38:51.660 align:start position:0%
with the recommendation of the Guardian
 
04:38:55.150 --> 04:38:55.160 align:start position:0%
Ad Litem you do have by definition here
 
04:38:57.590 --> 04:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
oppositional that's right and that's
 
04:38:59.570 --> 04:38:59.580 align:start position:0%
when we're required under the guardian
 
04:39:02.750 --> 04:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
ad litem rules to
 
04:39:04.750 --> 04:39:04.760 align:start position:0%
um share that with the court
 
04:39:08.510 --> 04:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
repeatedly if need be two anyone else
 
04:39:11.090 --> 04:39:11.100 align:start position:0%
representative McMahon thank you Mr
 
04:39:13.789 --> 04:39:13.799 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you Ms Ms sink do I
 
04:39:16.189 --> 04:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
get that right yes thank you uh two
 
04:39:18.410 --> 04:39:18.420 align:start position:0%
questions for you um we have received a
 
04:39:21.470 --> 04:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
report here and it said uh what
 
04:39:23.929 --> 04:39:23.939 align:start position:0%
separates us as the
 
04:39:26.890 --> 04:39:26.900 align:start position:0%
chair in the uh chairman McPherson
 
04:39:29.390 --> 04:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
Pearson stated was that New Hampshire
 
04:39:31.551 --> 04:39:31.561 align:start position:0%
was in is not part of states that
 
04:39:34.789 --> 04:39:34.799 align:start position:0%
provide representation but it says here
 
04:39:36.109 --> 04:39:36.119 align:start position:0%
um in its statement says it doesn't
 
04:39:38.330 --> 04:39:38.340 align:start position:0%
guarantee the right to counsel although
 
04:39:39.948 --> 04:39:39.958 align:start position:0%
we would have the option
 
04:39:42.110 --> 04:39:42.120 align:start position:0%
do you uh my first question based on
 
04:39:44.330 --> 04:39:44.340 align:start position:0%
that is should we guarantee the right to
 
04:39:46.368 --> 04:39:46.378 align:start position:0%
counsel as part of this bill
 
04:39:49.788 --> 04:39:49.798 align:start position:0%
I I would I would suggest that well I
 
04:39:51.530 --> 04:39:51.540 align:start position:0%
think as as I said earlier I don't think
 
04:39:53.930 --> 04:39:53.940 align:start position:0%
it's necessary on all cases
 
04:39:55.970 --> 04:39:55.980 align:start position:0%
um I do think at times there are certain
 
04:39:57.830 --> 04:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
types of cases where attorney
 
04:40:00.650 --> 04:40:00.660 align:start position:0%
representation for example we deal with
 
04:40:02.330 --> 04:40:02.340 align:start position:0%
immigration cases
 
04:40:04.190 --> 04:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
um at times of children who are trying
 
04:40:07.190 --> 04:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
to get their green card they need they
 
04:40:08.448 --> 04:40:08.458 align:start position:0%
need an attorney to help them through
 
04:40:11.330 --> 04:40:11.340 align:start position:0%
that process so we've we've had pro bono
 
04:40:13.730 --> 04:40:13.740 align:start position:0%
support from some immigration attorneys
 
04:40:15.410 --> 04:40:15.420 align:start position:0%
to help that happen but there are
 
04:40:17.930 --> 04:40:17.940 align:start position:0%
certain types of cases where I think
 
04:40:20.510 --> 04:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
um legal representation for the child
 
04:40:23.570 --> 04:40:23.580 align:start position:0%
could be a valuable thing for them but I
 
04:40:26.208 --> 04:40:26.218 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say all cases understood one
 
04:40:28.070 --> 04:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up Mr chairman thank you thank
 
04:40:30.650 --> 04:40:30.660 align:start position:0%
you sir specific to the bill it's it's
 
04:40:34.448 --> 04:40:34.458 align:start position:0%
focusing on abuse and neglect
 
04:40:36.948 --> 04:40:36.958 align:start position:0%
by by narrative
 
04:40:40.430 --> 04:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
uh you referred to protocols for any
 
04:40:42.230 --> 04:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
child to attend court within your
 
04:40:44.448 --> 04:40:44.458 align:start position:0%
construct of how you do business is
 
04:40:45.890 --> 04:40:45.900 align:start position:0%
language that
 
04:40:47.750 --> 04:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
was within the protocol should should
 
04:40:50.930 --> 04:40:50.940 align:start position:0%
any of that be applicable or applied to
 
04:40:54.110 --> 04:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
the bill that is to be adjusted as the
 
04:40:55.730 --> 04:40:55.740 align:start position:0%
chair has recommended that's an
 
04:40:57.650 --> 04:40:57.660 align:start position:0%
interesting idea
 
04:40:59.750 --> 04:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if the division feels
 
04:41:02.208 --> 04:41:02.218 align:start position:0%
how they feel about that but um
 
04:41:04.430 --> 04:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
there may be and I I guess I never
 
04:41:06.050 --> 04:41:06.060 align:start position:0%
looked at it through that haven't looked
 
04:41:08.510 --> 04:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
at through that lens of is there a
 
04:41:10.670 --> 04:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
protocol that could be incorporated in
 
04:41:10.680 --> 04:41:12.230 align:start position:0%
protocol that could be incorporated in
this

04:41:12.230 --> 04:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:41:13.910 --> 04:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
um just one final clarification thanks
 
04:41:15.470 --> 04:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
04:41:17.150 --> 04:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
um can you provide what your those
 
04:41:19.490 --> 04:41:19.500 align:start position:0%
Protocols are there in writing yeah so I
 
04:41:21.050 --> 04:41:21.060 align:start position:0%
would love to be at the same
 
04:41:22.670 --> 04:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
intelligentia level you are on that
 
04:41:24.830 --> 04:41:24.840 align:start position:0%
issue sure you can make an informed
 
04:41:26.650 --> 04:41:26.660 align:start position:0%
decision sure yeah
 
04:41:29.030 --> 04:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
or I'm sure
 
04:41:30.770 --> 04:41:30.780 align:start position:0%
um the court could share those as well
 
04:41:32.930 --> 04:41:32.940 align:start position:0%
so they are a document that we is used
 
04:41:35.150 --> 04:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
regularly and would you be prepared to
 
04:41:36.948 --> 04:41:36.958 align:start position:0%
share that with the committee yes okay
 
04:41:38.868 --> 04:41:38.878 align:start position:0%
good thank you
 
04:41:40.010 --> 04:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
I think we have a member of the
 
04:41:41.570 --> 04:41:41.580 align:start position:0%
committee that has already
 
04:41:44.390 --> 04:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
found the materials we require your
 
04:41:44.400 --> 04:41:45.530 align:start position:0%
found the materials we require your
honor

04:41:45.530 --> 04:41:45.540 align:start position:0%
honor
 
04:41:47.990 --> 04:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
they are that will not put you out of a
 
04:41:49.910 --> 04:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
job However the fact no he's done that
 
04:41:51.350 --> 04:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
too well they are in the court website
 
04:41:53.930 --> 04:41:53.940 align:start position:0%
yes yes Miss Miss sink knows very well
 
04:41:55.990 --> 04:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
that I would never put her out of a job
 
04:41:58.850 --> 04:41:58.860 align:start position:0%
but yes they're on the court website if
 
04:42:01.310 --> 04:42:01.320 align:start position:0%
you just Google protocols relative to
 
04:42:02.868 --> 04:42:02.878 align:start position:0%
Children and Youth in court New
 
04:42:02.878 --> 04:42:04.010 align:start position:0%

um it goes through RSA 169 C and all of
 
04:42:09.650 --> 04:42:09.660 align:start position:0%
the protocols could you send that to me
 
04:42:13.190 --> 04:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
directly so I maybe committee send it to
 
04:42:15.070 --> 04:42:15.080 align:start position:0%

04:42:40.920 --> 04:42:42.948 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:42:42.948 --> 04:42:42.958 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:42:44.868 --> 04:42:44.878 align:start position:0%
she's back if you have any further
 
04:42:46.128 --> 04:42:46.138 align:start position:0%
questions anybody has any further
 
04:42:46.138 --> 04:42:50.150 align:start position:0%
questions anybody has any further
questions

04:42:50.150 --> 04:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:52.910 --> 04:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
representative DeSimone
 
04:42:56.628 --> 04:42:56.638 align:start position:0%
the question that I asked the CEO and
 
04:42:58.610 --> 04:42:58.620 align:start position:0%
could not be answered I noticed you were
 
04:43:04.810 --> 04:43:04.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:10.610 --> 04:43:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:12.708 --> 04:43:12.718 align:start position:0%
I was smiling because I'm also not a
 
04:43:12.718 --> 04:43:13.730 align:start position:0%
I was smiling because I'm also not a
clinician

04:43:13.730 --> 04:43:13.740 align:start position:0%
clinician
 
04:43:17.410 --> 04:43:17.420 align:start position:0%
um so uh we
 
04:43:20.868 --> 04:43:20.878 align:start position:0%
minor age children do not testify the
 
04:43:24.770 --> 04:43:24.780 align:start position:0%
information that has that about the
 
04:43:26.810 --> 04:43:26.820 align:start position:0%
child whether it's abuse or neglect
 
04:43:30.050 --> 04:43:30.060 align:start position:0%
comes in through the cpsw who has
 
04:43:32.390 --> 04:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
conducted her assessment by talking to
 
04:43:35.090 --> 04:43:35.100 align:start position:0%
the child the parents and any other sort
 
04:43:36.708 --> 04:43:36.718 align:start position:0%
of collateral contact
 
04:43:39.948 --> 04:43:39.958 align:start position:0%
so uh we do not allow children to
 
04:43:42.250 --> 04:43:42.260 align:start position:0%
testify in proceedings
 
04:43:45.830 --> 04:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
and I would not want the division would
 
04:43:50.868 --> 04:43:50.878 align:start position:0%
not be supportive of uh any any change
 
04:43:53.810 --> 04:43:53.820 align:start position:0%
to the law that would require child that
 
04:43:55.430 --> 04:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
children Could children should
 
04:43:57.650 --> 04:43:57.660 align:start position:0%
participate in their cases they didn't
 
04:43:59.868 --> 04:43:59.878 align:start position:0%
need a voice but from the dispositional
 
04:44:03.410 --> 04:44:03.420 align:start position:0%
phase on not to be involved with the
 
04:44:05.150 --> 04:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
fact-finding surrounding what has
 
04:44:07.788 --> 04:44:07.798 align:start position:0%
happened to them you would also asked
 
04:44:09.770 --> 04:44:09.780 align:start position:0%
about you know and I'm not a clinician
 
04:44:11.810 --> 04:44:11.820 align:start position:0%
so I'm going a little bit out on a limb
 
04:44:15.110 --> 04:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
here but about whether or not children
 
04:44:18.350 --> 04:44:18.360 align:start position:0%
lie if they've been coached uh generally
 
04:44:18.360 --> 04:44:20.930 align:start position:0%
lie if they've been coached uh generally
I

04:44:20.930 --> 04:44:20.940 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:44:23.270 --> 04:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
the division cannot repeatedly question
 
04:44:23.280 --> 04:44:24.910 align:start position:0%
the division cannot repeatedly question
children

04:44:24.910 --> 04:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
children
 
04:44:28.250 --> 04:44:28.260 align:start position:0%
they will actually refer them to a was
 
04:44:30.770 --> 04:44:30.780 align:start position:0%
the Child Advocacy Center for and also
 
04:44:32.750 --> 04:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
do forensic interviews of them
 
04:44:36.770 --> 04:44:36.780 align:start position:0%
and I think this consensus is is that a
 
04:44:39.708 --> 04:44:39.718 align:start position:0%
child who has been coached that becomes
 
04:44:41.690 --> 04:44:41.700 align:start position:0%
somewhat apparent
 
04:44:43.788 --> 04:44:43.798 align:start position:0%
um on a further interview because they
 
04:44:43.798 --> 04:44:44.570 align:start position:0%
um on a further interview because they
just

04:44:44.570 --> 04:44:44.580 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:44:47.690 --> 04:44:47.700 align:start position:0%
you know they I don't want to say this
 
04:44:49.368 --> 04:44:49.378 align:start position:0%
about kids but they can't keep the story
 
04:44:51.350 --> 04:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
straight you know it's
 
04:44:54.590 --> 04:44:54.600 align:start position:0%
um when a child is consistent about an
 
04:44:56.208 --> 04:44:56.218 align:start position:0%
event to two or three different people
 
04:44:58.510 --> 04:44:58.520 align:start position:0%
that is compelling
 
04:45:01.190 --> 04:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
again we do not repeatedly question
 
04:45:03.230 --> 04:45:03.240 align:start position:0%
children about things that happen to
 
04:45:05.030 --> 04:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
them thank you that's what I was looking
 
04:45:10.010 --> 04:45:10.020 align:start position:0%
for okay thank you any further questions
 
04:45:14.510 --> 04:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:16.190 --> 04:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
you know it's so hard to get good
 
04:45:19.390 --> 04:45:19.400 align:start position:0%
lutefisk in New Hampshire
 
04:45:25.128 --> 04:45:25.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:27.050 --> 04:45:27.060 align:start position:0%
my wife almost fainted when I told her
 
04:45:28.490 --> 04:45:28.500 align:start position:0%

04:45:31.070 --> 04:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
yeah the chair recognizes Attorney

um we do as written
 
04:45:59.448 --> 04:45:59.458 align:start position:0%
um have some concerns we don't have any
 
04:46:01.070 --> 04:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
issues and we're not providing any
 
04:46:03.708 --> 04:46:03.718 align:start position:0%

04:46:20.570 --> 04:46:20.580 align:start position:0%
don't have any concerns
 
04:46:23.330 --> 04:46:23.340 align:start position:0%
part two of the of the bill is a new
 
04:46:26.448 --> 04:46:26.458 align:start position:0%
section in RSA 490d and and there are
 
04:46:28.910 --> 04:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
some questions earlier about
 
04:46:30.770 --> 04:46:30.780 align:start position:0%
um this being related to abuse and
 
04:46:33.890 --> 04:46:33.900 align:start position:0%
neglect 490d is the statute that creates
 
04:46:36.410 --> 04:46:36.420 align:start position:0%
Family Division so everything in Family
 
04:46:39.470 --> 04:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
Division is 490d 490d just establishes
 
04:46:42.170 --> 04:46:42.180 align:start position:0%
that so if and we would appreciate if
 
04:46:43.970 --> 04:46:43.980 align:start position:0%
there was some narrowing of that so that
 
04:46:45.948 --> 04:46:45.958 align:start position:0%
there's a specific issue abuse and
 
04:46:47.930 --> 04:46:47.940 align:start position:0%
neglect or what it may be that'd be
 
04:46:51.650 --> 04:46:51.660 align:start position:0%
placed in that section 490d would
 
04:46:53.448 --> 04:46:53.458 align:start position:0%
suggest that every child in Every Family
 
04:46:55.610 --> 04:46:55.620 align:start position:0%
Division case is entitled by a matter of
 
04:46:58.970 --> 04:46:58.980 align:start position:0%
right to it to a lawyer
 
04:47:01.730 --> 04:47:01.740 align:start position:0%
um the other aspect of the bill that has
 
04:47:04.850 --> 04:47:04.860 align:start position:0%
as written became is is very unclear is
 
04:47:06.948 --> 04:47:06.958 align:start position:0%
it doesn't talk about
 
04:47:09.890 --> 04:47:09.900 align:start position:0%
how that lawyer is being brought to that
 
04:47:11.150 --> 04:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
child how they're connecting who's
 
04:47:13.970 --> 04:47:13.980 align:start position:0%
paying how sort of a processed a new
 
04:47:17.510 --> 04:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
Standalone sentence that has no
 
04:47:21.350 --> 04:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
particular connection to a court
 
04:47:24.770 --> 04:47:24.780 align:start position:0%
um referral a court order and and a
 
04:47:26.990 --> 04:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
payment Source
 
04:47:29.750 --> 04:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
um so unsure in terms of what is
 
04:47:31.850 --> 04:47:31.860 align:start position:0%
intended there we would have a great
 
04:47:34.850 --> 04:47:34.860 align:start position:0%
deal of concern if the parties were
 
04:47:37.128 --> 04:47:37.138 align:start position:0%
selecting or a party was selecting a
 
04:47:39.830 --> 04:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
lawyer for a child where the there's a
 
04:47:42.708 --> 04:47:42.718 align:start position:0%
significant opportunity to manipulate
 
04:47:46.970 --> 04:47:46.980 align:start position:0%
that child in the proceeding so if a
 
04:47:49.550 --> 04:47:49.560 align:start position:0%
party is paying for the attorney and
 
04:47:51.948 --> 04:47:51.958 align:start position:0%
that party then has a has some form of
 
04:47:55.448 --> 04:47:55.458 align:start position:0%
relationship with the attorney
 
04:47:59.150 --> 04:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
it creates significant issues in terms
 
04:48:01.070 --> 04:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
of of the independence of that lawyer
 
04:48:02.410 --> 04:48:02.420 align:start position:0%
the child
 
04:48:05.530 --> 04:48:05.540 align:start position:0%
and within the proceeding
 
04:48:08.090 --> 04:48:08.100 align:start position:0%
but as written and it's a simple
 
04:48:10.730 --> 04:48:10.740 align:start position:0%
Standalone sentence that seems to be
 
04:48:13.128 --> 04:48:13.138 align:start position:0%
almost jurisdictional it just says if a
 
04:48:15.170 --> 04:48:15.180 align:start position:0%
lawyer appears for a child the court has
 
04:48:16.330 --> 04:48:16.340 align:start position:0%
no right
 
04:48:19.610 --> 04:48:19.620 align:start position:0%
to to interfere with that and at that
 
04:48:21.890 --> 04:48:21.900 align:start position:0%
point we have concerns just who's paying
 
04:48:23.208 --> 04:48:23.218 align:start position:0%
for that lawyer what's the relationship
 
04:48:25.368 --> 04:48:25.378 align:start position:0%
of the lawyer to the to a party in the
 
04:48:27.530 --> 04:48:27.540 align:start position:0%
proceeding or to someone outside of the
 
04:48:30.910 --> 04:48:30.920 align:start position:0%
parties but who may still have a role
 
04:48:34.730 --> 04:48:34.740 align:start position:0%
in sort of affecting how that child is
 
04:48:38.030 --> 04:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
is being presented so just significant
 
04:48:41.208 --> 04:48:41.218 align:start position:0%
concerns as written we're always happy
 
04:48:42.650 --> 04:48:42.660 align:start position:0%
to work with a sponsor with the
 
04:48:44.628 --> 04:48:44.638 align:start position:0%
advocates in terms of additional
 
04:48:47.030 --> 04:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
language or changing uh or modifying the
 
04:48:51.368 --> 04:48:51.378 align:start position:0%
bill but as written we would suggest
 
04:48:54.350 --> 04:48:54.360 align:start position:0%
itl but that doesn't mean that there
 
04:48:57.708 --> 04:48:57.718 align:start position:0%
can't be changes that that improve it
 
04:48:59.390 --> 04:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
um and we'd be happy to work with with
 
04:49:01.368 --> 04:49:01.378 align:start position:0%
the committee and the sponsor to do that
 
04:49:03.708 --> 04:49:03.718 align:start position:0%
yeah counselor while you were at another
 
04:49:07.670 --> 04:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
meeting the prime sponsor opened up by
 
04:49:10.310 --> 04:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
saying this is really a draft job this
 
04:49:13.670 --> 04:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
was done on the fast and I trust that
 
04:49:17.090 --> 04:49:17.100 align:start position:0%
now he who is at another committee will
 
04:49:19.250 --> 04:49:19.260 align:start position:0%
review the the
 
04:49:20.868 --> 04:49:20.878 align:start position:0%
I almost said tape I don't know what
 
04:49:23.150 --> 04:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
it's called now but the you know
 
04:49:26.628 --> 04:49:26.638 align:start position:0%
recording of this hearing to pick up the
 
04:49:29.330 --> 04:49:29.340 align:start position:0%
various comments some of these issues I
 
04:49:30.970 --> 04:49:30.980 align:start position:0%
think he's quite aware of
 
04:49:33.170 --> 04:49:33.180 align:start position:0%
there's some good stuff in here and I
 
04:49:35.990 --> 04:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
think he's very amenable to uh rewriting
 
04:49:38.150 --> 04:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
with the input of people who've been
 
04:49:40.190 --> 04:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
testifying today terrific and I
 
04:49:42.050 --> 04:49:42.060 align:start position:0%
appreciate that and again apologize for
 
04:49:43.730 --> 04:49:43.740 align:start position:0%
for being late in coming into the
 
04:49:46.190 --> 04:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
hearing and I don't know I know back in
 
04:49:48.170 --> 04:49:48.180 align:start position:0%
the day there were the work sessions
 
04:49:49.970 --> 04:49:49.980 align:start position:0%
were created I don't know if the if the
 
04:49:51.410 --> 04:49:51.420 align:start position:0%
chair has any interest in in doing a
 
04:49:53.390 --> 04:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
work session on this bill given sort of
 
04:49:55.070 --> 04:49:55.080 align:start position:0%
the number of people that they may have
 
04:49:57.410 --> 04:49:57.420 align:start position:0%
been interested My Hope Is that they'll
 
04:50:00.170 --> 04:50:00.180 align:start position:0%
key into him at this point and he will
 
04:50:03.110 --> 04:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
produce a draft Amendment and perhaps
 
04:50:06.110 --> 04:50:06.120 align:start position:0%
some of us might take a look at it I do
 
04:50:07.788 --> 04:50:07.798 align:start position:0%
work sessions differently than some
 
04:50:07.798 --> 04:50:09.410 align:start position:0%
work sessions differently than some
chairs

04:50:09.410 --> 04:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
chairs
 
04:50:09.420 --> 04:50:10.670 align:start position:0%
chairs
great

04:50:10.670 --> 04:50:10.680 align:start position:0%
great
 
04:50:12.708 --> 04:50:12.718 align:start position:0%
um with that I've concluded my testimony
 
04:50:14.570 --> 04:50:14.580 align:start position:0%
if there any other questions I'd be
 
04:50:18.050 --> 04:50:18.060 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any uh questions of
 
04:50:18.060 --> 04:50:19.788 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any uh questions of
counselor

04:50:19.788 --> 04:50:19.798 align:start position:0%
counselor
 
04:50:22.310 --> 04:50:22.320 align:start position:0%
had representative
 
04:50:22.320 --> 04:50:23.750 align:start position:0%
had representative
Raymond

04:50:23.750 --> 04:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
Raymond
 
04:50:26.868 --> 04:50:26.878 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and um thank you
 
04:50:28.970 --> 04:50:28.980 align:start position:0%
um attorney hid
 
04:50:31.730 --> 04:50:31.740 align:start position:0%
um I have a question and it's kind of a
 
04:50:36.410 --> 04:50:36.420 align:start position:0%
general legal lease kind of question so
 
04:50:40.430 --> 04:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
in this in section two here it says well
 
04:50:42.350 --> 04:50:42.360 align:start position:0%
section one under
 
04:50:44.810 --> 04:50:44.820 align:start position:0%
um Roman numeral two it says an attorney
 
04:50:47.448 --> 04:50:47.458 align:start position:0%
to represent the interest of a child and
 
04:50:49.970 --> 04:50:49.980 align:start position:0%
today in testimony many people have
 
04:50:51.830 --> 04:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
talked about the best interest of a
 
04:50:53.990 --> 04:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
child and so now it's gotten me thinking
 
04:50:56.090 --> 04:50:56.100 align:start position:0%
about what's the difference
 
04:50:58.430 --> 04:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
legally speaking
 
04:51:00.948 --> 04:51:00.958 align:start position:0%
between the interest of the child and
 
04:51:03.650 --> 04:51:03.660 align:start position:0%
the best interest of a child like
 
04:51:07.190 --> 04:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
what what what's a demarcation there so
 
04:51:07.200 --> 04:51:08.390 align:start position:0%
what what what's a demarcation there so
I

04:51:08.390 --> 04:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:51:10.070 --> 04:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I think the
 
04:51:13.128 --> 04:51:13.138 align:start position:0%
the demarcation I might make differently
 
04:51:14.930 --> 04:51:14.940 align:start position:0%
best interest of the child is the legal
 
04:51:17.448 --> 04:51:17.458 align:start position:0%
standard for the judge to apply when
 
04:51:19.610 --> 04:51:19.620 align:start position:0%
making a decision relative to the to the
 
04:51:22.910 --> 04:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
child and that's laid out statute and
 
04:51:24.650 --> 04:51:24.660 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to sort of are you
 
04:51:25.788 --> 04:51:25.798 align:start position:0%
going through the statute partly because
 
04:51:27.350 --> 04:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
I don't have in front of me I think the
 
04:51:29.030 --> 04:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
testimony was
 
04:51:31.550 --> 04:51:31.560 align:start position:0%
um the difference between what are the
 
04:51:33.170 --> 04:51:33.180 align:start position:0%
best interests of the child which is
 
04:51:34.970 --> 04:51:34.980 align:start position:0%
done through testimony in the
 
04:51:37.310 --> 04:51:37.320 align:start position:0%
investigation and and the process and
 
04:51:40.070 --> 04:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
what the child wants and what the child
 
04:51:43.550 --> 04:51:43.560 align:start position:0%
wants can uh be dramatically different
 
04:51:46.430 --> 04:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
than the best interest of the child
 
04:51:48.770 --> 04:51:48.780 align:start position:0%
um you know child children obviously are
 
04:51:51.410 --> 04:51:51.420 align:start position:0%
not always interested in their long-term
 
04:51:53.628 --> 04:51:53.638 align:start position:0%
best interest but something that's
 
04:51:55.610 --> 04:51:55.620 align:start position:0%
happening tomorrow
 
04:51:59.390 --> 04:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
um or or now so you know it those two
 
04:52:01.788 --> 04:52:01.798 align:start position:0%
are very different concepts you know the
 
04:52:03.050 --> 04:52:03.060 align:start position:0%
interests of the child in the best
 
04:52:05.270 --> 04:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
interest of the child
 
04:52:07.310 --> 04:52:07.320 align:start position:0%
um I I don't think there's a legal
 
04:52:09.050 --> 04:52:09.060 align:start position:0%
difference per se I think best interest
 
04:52:10.850 --> 04:52:10.860 align:start position:0%
of the child is the standard that that
 
04:52:13.550 --> 04:52:13.560 align:start position:0%
we're applying when evaluating the facts
 
04:52:17.750 --> 04:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
expertise and and reports as courts
 
04:52:19.430 --> 04:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
um when making decisions
 
04:52:21.470 --> 04:52:21.480 align:start position:0%
may not answer a question I apologize if
 
04:52:23.390 --> 04:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
it didn't
 
04:52:27.170 --> 04:52:27.180 align:start position:0%
inline one of 2A in cases involving a
 
04:52:29.330 --> 04:52:29.340 align:start position:0%
neglected or abused child under this
 
04:52:32.628 --> 04:52:32.638 align:start position:0%
chapter with the child's expressed
 
04:52:35.930 --> 04:52:35.940 align:start position:0%
interests conflict with any
 
04:52:40.070 --> 04:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the gal I we've been
 
04:52:42.890 --> 04:52:42.900 align:start position:0%
circling around that just now that the
 
04:52:45.410 --> 04:52:45.420 align:start position:0%
child's expressed interest could be I
 
04:52:47.510 --> 04:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
want to have a pizza at midnight and the
 
04:52:50.448 --> 04:52:50.458 align:start position:0%
gal says no way I I thought the earlier
 
04:52:52.788 --> 04:52:52.798 align:start position:0%
comment from DC wife was was appropriate
 
04:52:56.510 --> 04:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of any does mean any uh and it
 
04:52:59.810 --> 04:52:59.820 align:start position:0%
become and can become quite trivial
 
04:52:59.820 --> 04:53:00.970 align:start position:0%
become and can become quite trivial
um

04:53:00.970 --> 04:53:00.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:05.208 --> 04:53:05.218 align:start position:0%
so I I think I think that's a fair point
 
04:53:07.010 --> 04:53:07.020 align:start position:0%
we're just not taking a position in
 
04:53:08.810 --> 04:53:08.820 align:start position:0%
terms one way the other have input in
 
04:53:10.670 --> 04:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
terms of what the right language should
 
04:53:13.430 --> 04:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
be and yet changing the word there too
 
04:53:16.670 --> 04:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
the child's best interests
 
04:53:19.550 --> 04:53:19.560 align:start position:0%
kind of to me May moderately
 
04:53:21.890 --> 04:53:21.900 align:start position:0%
disenfranchise the child from having a
 
04:53:24.470 --> 04:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
different opinion from a gal because if
 
04:53:26.570 --> 04:53:26.580 align:start position:0%
the gal thinks this is the best interest
 
04:53:28.250 --> 04:53:28.260 align:start position:0%
of the child then it really doesn't
 
04:53:29.930 --> 04:53:29.940 align:start position:0%
matter what the expressed interest of
 
04:53:33.230 --> 04:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
the child is and to me that's just a
 
04:53:35.570 --> 04:53:35.580 align:start position:0%
little bit too much pushing away so I
 
04:53:37.850 --> 04:53:37.860 align:start position:0%
don't think and and I think I better
 
04:53:39.530 --> 04:53:39.540 align:start position:0%
understand the question that was asked
 
04:53:41.690 --> 04:53:41.700 align:start position:0%
before you know I I would
 
04:53:44.208 --> 04:53:44.218 align:start position:0%
I would say one represents the interest
 
04:53:47.690 --> 04:53:47.700 align:start position:0%
of the child is a want of the child as a
 
04:53:49.250 --> 04:53:49.260 align:start position:0%
practical matter in terms of of that
 
04:53:51.590 --> 04:53:51.600 align:start position:0%
sentence in terms of the best interest
 
04:53:53.330 --> 04:53:53.340 align:start position:0%
of the child it's not only the guardian
 
04:53:55.610 --> 04:53:55.620 align:start position:0%
ad litem report that obviously is a
 
04:53:57.590 --> 04:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
significant contributor to the
 
04:53:59.628 --> 04:53:59.638 align:start position:0%
information that is received by the
 
04:54:01.788 --> 04:54:01.798 align:start position:0%
court but there may be other information
 
04:54:05.030 --> 04:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
and experts or factual testimony that's
 
04:54:07.610 --> 04:54:07.620 align:start position:0%
presented that are taken collectively
 
04:54:09.830 --> 04:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
together to do for the for the court to
 
04:54:12.470 --> 04:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
make an ultimate decision on what are
 
04:54:14.090 --> 04:54:14.100 align:start position:0%
the best interests of the child the
 
04:54:17.090 --> 04:54:17.100 align:start position:0%
guardian ad litem is a significant but
 
04:54:18.948 --> 04:54:18.958 align:start position:0%
only one aspect
 
04:54:20.628 --> 04:54:20.638 align:start position:0%
um in in terms of that decision making
 
04:54:23.868 --> 04:54:23.878 align:start position:0%
but that would then render the child's
 
04:54:23.878 --> 04:54:25.270 align:start position:0%
but that would then render the child's
interests

04:54:25.270 --> 04:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
interests
 
04:54:27.708 --> 04:54:27.718 align:start position:0%
irrelevant the child's expressed
 
04:54:29.930 --> 04:54:29.940 align:start position:0%
interests so they're not a participant
 
04:54:31.970 --> 04:54:31.980 align:start position:0%
in that group I'm looking for a word
 
04:54:35.510 --> 04:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
between expressed and best
 
04:54:38.150 --> 04:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
where the child does have a say and it
 
04:54:40.010 --> 04:54:40.020 align:start position:0%
may not necessarily be what the gal
 
04:54:43.850 --> 04:54:43.860 align:start position:0%
wants and that's tough on the gal in a
 
04:54:46.910 --> 04:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
few cases maybe so I think the if you
 
04:54:49.970 --> 04:54:49.980 align:start position:0%
look at the rule that was referenced
 
04:54:49.980 --> 04:54:50.990 align:start position:0%
look at the rule that was referenced
um

04:54:50.990 --> 04:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:54.170 --> 04:54:54.180 align:start position:0%
earlier in terms of of one of the
 
04:54:56.208 --> 04:54:56.218 align:start position:0%
obligations of the guardian of item and
 
04:54:59.090 --> 04:54:59.100 align:start position:0%
Casa is that if the guardian and this is
 
04:55:01.250 --> 04:55:01.260 align:start position:0%
what the rule says if a guardian ad
 
04:55:03.110 --> 04:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
litem is aware that a recipient of the
 
04:55:05.410 --> 04:55:05.420 align:start position:0%
services disagrees with a recommendation
 
04:55:08.448 --> 04:55:08.458 align:start position:0%
being made by the guardian ad litem the
 
04:55:10.490 --> 04:55:10.500 align:start position:0%
guardian ad litem shall fully advise the
 
04:55:12.770 --> 04:55:12.780 align:start position:0%
appointing Court of this fact I think
 
04:55:15.590 --> 04:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
that that is good language in terms of
 
04:55:17.570 --> 04:55:17.580 align:start position:0%
good language of what I think you're
 
04:55:19.910 --> 04:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
trying to address that's just for
 
04:55:23.570 --> 04:55:23.580 align:start position:0%
reference purpose it's gal rules Jal
 
04:55:23.580 --> 04:55:29.810 align:start position:0%
reference purpose it's gal rules Jal

04:55:33.010 --> 04:55:33.020 align:start position:0%
thank you that's very helpful great
 
04:55:37.190 --> 04:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:39.650 --> 04:55:39.660 align:start position:0%
we have one final pink card and after
 
04:55:41.810 --> 04:55:41.820 align:start position:0%

04:56:10.550 --> 04:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
okay I'm just going to give you some
 
04:56:13.368 --> 04:56:13.378 align:start position:0%
observations from working with children
 
04:56:16.910 --> 04:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
who have had bad experiences in Family
 
04:56:16.920 --> 04:56:18.170 align:start position:0%
who have had bad experiences in Family
Court

04:56:18.170 --> 04:56:18.180 align:start position:0%
Court
 
04:56:21.830 --> 04:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
I share the same concern that attorney
 
04:56:25.690 --> 04:56:25.700 align:start position:0%
had just expressed about attorneys being
 
04:56:30.170 --> 04:56:30.180 align:start position:0%
appointed for children who's paying them
 
04:56:30.180 --> 04:56:31.610 align:start position:0%
appointed for children who's paying them
because

04:56:31.610 --> 04:56:31.620 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:56:34.610 --> 04:56:34.620 align:start position:0%
that can have a lot to do with what the
 
04:56:36.890 --> 04:56:36.900 align:start position:0%
attorney recommends
 
04:56:39.948 --> 04:56:39.958 align:start position:0%
it also is the same problem that we have
 
04:56:44.510 --> 04:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
now with court appointed gals
 
04:56:47.090 --> 04:56:47.100 align:start position:0%
so I'm not surprised to see that some
 
04:56:49.910 --> 04:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
child children have expressed a
 
04:56:53.330 --> 04:56:53.340 align:start position:0%
different opinion from the gal that they
 
04:56:56.330 --> 04:56:56.340 align:start position:0%
were assigned and have heard some pretty
 
04:56:59.570 --> 04:56:59.580 align:start position:0%
bad horror stories so
 
04:57:02.208 --> 04:57:02.218 align:start position:0%
um it's the same situation who's paying
 
04:57:06.708 --> 04:57:06.718 align:start position:0%
the gal often has the most Sway in the
 
04:57:09.890 --> 04:57:09.900 align:start position:0%
decisions of the gal the recommendations
 
04:57:13.810 --> 04:57:13.820 align:start position:0%
of the gal I really don't like to hear
 
04:57:16.010 --> 04:57:16.020 align:start position:0%
it said that
 
04:57:19.490 --> 04:57:19.500 align:start position:0%
we can't afford to be fair
 
04:57:22.550 --> 04:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
I've heard this excuse before on
 
04:57:24.708 --> 04:57:24.718 align:start position:0%
recommended changes in the court system
 
04:57:27.530 --> 04:57:27.540 align:start position:0%
while we can't afford it well we're
 
04:57:29.868 --> 04:57:29.878 align:start position:0%
guaranteed rights
 
04:57:32.090 --> 04:57:32.100 align:start position:0%
they didn't put it in the Constitution
 
04:57:34.970 --> 04:57:34.980 align:start position:0%
either one that we don't get the rights
 
04:57:36.770 --> 04:57:36.780 align:start position:0%
if the government doesn't feel like
 
04:57:38.208 --> 04:57:38.218 align:start position:0%
paying for them
 
04:57:41.208 --> 04:57:41.218 align:start position:0%
so that's our job is to fight for the
 
04:57:44.990 --> 04:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:45.000 --> 04:57:48.890 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:57:48.890 --> 04:57:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:50.948 --> 04:57:50.958 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure that I don't repeat
 
04:57:52.970 --> 04:57:52.980 align:start position:0%
some things
 
04:57:52.980 --> 04:57:53.628 align:start position:0%
some things
um

04:57:53.628 --> 04:57:53.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:57.830 --> 04:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
I'm curious too that on lines 15
 
04:58:00.650 --> 04:58:00.660 align:start position:0%
when it says the minor child who is the
 
04:58:03.170 --> 04:58:03.180 align:start position:0%
subject of such proceedings
 
04:58:05.990 --> 04:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
is they referring right then to this
 
04:58:08.770 --> 04:58:08.780 align:start position:0%
subject of neglected and abused children
 
04:58:11.270 --> 04:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
because if it is that needs to be
 
04:58:11.280 --> 04:58:12.910 align:start position:0%
because if it is that needs to be
specified

04:58:12.910 --> 04:58:12.920 align:start position:0%
specified
 
04:58:17.510 --> 04:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
because otherwise it does sound like all
 
04:58:19.550 --> 04:58:19.560 align:start position:0%
minor children shall be entitled to
 
04:58:23.470 --> 04:58:23.480 align:start position:0%
representation by counsel well right now
 
04:58:26.448 --> 04:58:26.458 align:start position:0%
almost all children who get involved in
 
04:58:28.850 --> 04:58:28.860 align:start position:0%
Family Court like in a divorce
 
04:58:28.860 --> 04:58:30.350 align:start position:0%
Family Court like in a divorce
proceedings

04:58:30.350 --> 04:58:30.360 align:start position:0%
proceedings
 
04:58:33.590 --> 04:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
there's no choice they get assigned a
 
04:58:33.600 --> 04:58:34.550 align:start position:0%
there's no choice they get assigned a
gal

04:58:34.550 --> 04:58:34.560 align:start position:0%
gal
 
04:58:37.250 --> 04:58:37.260 align:start position:0%
only the court doesn't have to pay for
 
04:58:37.260 --> 04:58:38.570 align:start position:0%
only the court doesn't have to pay for
it

04:58:38.570 --> 04:58:38.580 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:58:41.690 --> 04:58:41.700 align:start position:0%
so they can be very generous in ordering
 
04:58:41.700 --> 04:58:42.470 align:start position:0%
so they can be very generous in ordering
it

04:58:42.470 --> 04:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:58:45.350 --> 04:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
and then the parents get stuck paying
 
04:58:47.750 --> 04:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
and often the services can just go on
 
04:58:50.090 --> 04:58:50.100 align:start position:0%
and on and on and on so that's another
 
04:58:52.550 --> 04:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
subject right for
 
04:58:52.560 --> 04:58:55.310 align:start position:0%
subject right for
reform

04:58:55.310 --> 04:58:55.320 align:start position:0%
reform
 
04:58:57.830 --> 04:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
so many bad experiences have been
 
04:58:59.330 --> 04:58:59.340 align:start position:0%
reported to me
 
04:59:03.170 --> 04:59:03.180 align:start position:0%
when the gal does not represent the
 
04:59:05.868 --> 04:59:05.878 align:start position:0%
child so I don't have any solutions here
 
04:59:08.448 --> 04:59:08.458 align:start position:0%
I just see some places that we could
 
04:59:12.770 --> 04:59:12.780 align:start position:0%
tighten up the wording to be clearer but
 
04:59:16.070 --> 04:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
it's my experience my conclusion is my
 
04:59:18.070 --> 04:59:18.080 align:start position:0%
experience is that children
 
04:59:21.350 --> 04:59:21.360 align:start position:0%
often want to be heard have been
 
04:59:25.010 --> 04:59:25.020 align:start position:0%
absolutely refused to be heard maybe not
 
04:59:27.230 --> 04:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
in this kind of case maybe neglect and
 
04:59:30.110 --> 04:59:30.120 align:start position:0%
abuse they always get hurt
 
04:59:32.448 --> 04:59:32.458 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't sound like it and
 
04:59:35.390 --> 04:59:35.400 align:start position:0%
definitely in divorce proceedings that
 
04:59:38.208 --> 04:59:38.218 align:start position:0%
can get carried on forever
 
04:59:42.708 --> 04:59:42.718 align:start position:0%
I've definitely met kids who were very
 
04:59:45.650 --> 04:59:45.660 align:start position:0%
bright who would write letters they sent
 
04:59:47.990 --> 04:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
letters to the judge but they were never
 
04:59:50.270 --> 04:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
permitted to speak and they really
 
04:59:53.030 --> 04:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:55.910 --> 04:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative America
 
04:59:55.920 --> 05:00:00.890 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative America
gay

05:00:00.890 --> 05:00:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:03.470 --> 05:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you so much and I
 
05:00:06.410 --> 05:00:06.420 align:start position:0%
would strongly suggest that folks both
 
05:00:09.530 --> 05:00:09.540 align:start position:0%
who testified and of the committee
 
05:00:11.448 --> 05:00:11.458 align:start position:0%
um share your thoughts with
 
05:00:14.150 --> 05:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
representative hole it may be that this
 
05:00:16.010 --> 05:00:16.020 align:start position:0%
becomes an early bill when the fiscal
 
05:00:18.590 --> 05:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
note shows up so we don't have very long
 
05:00:22.670 --> 05:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
to do it this concludes the hearing on
 
05:00:25.550 --> 05:00:25.560 align:start position:0%
House Bill 535 and before you go
 
05:00:25.560 --> 05:00:27.708 align:start position:0%
House Bill 535 and before you go
anywhere

05:00:27.708 --> 05:00:27.718 align:start position:0%
anywhere
 
05:00:30.890 --> 05:00:30.900 align:start position:0%
um we have another bill to hear and let
 
05:00:33.170 --> 05:00:33.180 align:start position:0%
me give you the background story to it
 
05:00:37.490 --> 05:00:37.500 align:start position:0%
as you know the sununu youth center is
 
05:00:41.208 --> 05:00:41.218 align:start position:0%
scheduled to close very soon
 
05:00:42.770 --> 05:00:42.780 align:start position:0%
and by law
 
05:00:48.410 --> 05:00:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:50.930 --> 05:00:50.940 align:start position:0%
even in the design phase
 
05:00:54.110 --> 05:00:54.120 align:start position:0%
so the Senate and the house have been
 
05:00:57.410 --> 05:00:57.420 align:start position:0%
working very much behind the scenes as
 
05:01:01.430 --> 05:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
quickly as we can to come up with a bill
 
05:01:04.490 --> 05:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
and we have been given house bill 120.
 
05:01:10.850 --> 05:01:10.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:10.860 --> 05:01:11.810 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:01:11.810 --> 05:01:11.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:14.930 --> 05:01:14.940 align:start position:0%
what I am about to pass out to you is
 
05:01:18.190 --> 05:01:18.200 align:start position:0%
House Bill 120 Amendment
 
05:01:23.628 --> 05:01:23.638 align:start position:0%
0084 this language is identical to what
 
05:01:26.990 --> 05:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
the Senate just passed
 
05:01:29.690 --> 05:01:29.700 align:start position:0%
like a day or two ago
 
05:01:32.390 --> 05:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
and so this is the current Senate
 
05:01:36.590 --> 05:01:36.600 align:start position:0%
version what we will be asked to do down
 
05:01:41.208 --> 05:01:41.218 align:start position:0%
the road fairly soon is to go along with
 
05:01:44.750 --> 05:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
it thank you and that would happen to be
 
05:01:49.730 --> 05:01:49.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:49.740 --> 05:01:51.050 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:01:51.050 --> 05:01:51.060 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:01:55.368 --> 05:01:55.378 align:start position:0%
did he indicate when this was voted on
 
05:01:57.230 --> 05:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
by the Senate
 
05:01:59.330 --> 05:01:59.340 align:start position:0%
I would appreciate that because they're
 
05:02:01.510 --> 05:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
supposed to be today the Senate is
 
05:02:05.628 --> 05:02:05.638 align:start position:0%
taking a look at it in finance
 
05:02:10.490 --> 05:02:10.500 align:start position:0%
so 120 FN the amended thing that I'm
 
05:02:15.230 --> 05:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
about to give you may be a good document
 
05:02:18.650 --> 05:02:18.660 align:start position:0%
to have and maybe what was just handed
 
05:02:23.150 --> 05:02:23.160 align:start position:0%
to me is an amendment to this
 
05:02:25.490 --> 05:02:25.500 align:start position:0%
does it sound complicated to anybody
 
05:02:29.150 --> 05:02:29.160 align:start position:0%
yeah and confusing too what we're trying
 
05:02:31.670 --> 05:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
to do is come to an agreement between
 
05:02:33.650 --> 05:02:33.660 align:start position:0%
the house and the Senate through the
 
05:02:35.030 --> 05:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
Committees through the financial
 
05:02:37.788 --> 05:02:37.798 align:start position:0%
committees through the floor in voting
 
05:02:40.670 --> 05:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
and out the door and signed within the
 
05:02:42.470 --> 05:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
next few weeks I mean this is head
 
05:02:42.480 --> 05:02:43.810 align:start position:0%
next few weeks I mean this is head
spinning

05:02:43.810 --> 05:02:43.820 align:start position:0%
spinning
 
05:02:46.490 --> 05:02:46.500 align:start position:0%
but that's the only way we can have
 
05:02:49.128 --> 05:02:49.138 align:start position:0%
something legal to extend the life of
 
05:02:53.150 --> 05:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
the sununu center and go forward to what
 
05:02:57.410 --> 05:02:57.420 align:start position:0%
the department really needs so I'm going
 
05:03:01.788 --> 05:03:01.798 align:start position:0%
to hand out these documents to you uh
 
05:03:03.830 --> 05:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
House Bill 120
 
05:03:06.708 --> 05:03:06.718 align:start position:0%
and then I'm going to hand out Senate
 
05:03:06.718 --> 05:03:08.470 align:start position:0%
and then I'm going to hand out Senate
bill

05:03:08.470 --> 05:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:03:12.470 --> 05:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
Senate bill one Amendment these you're
 
05:03:16.128 --> 05:03:16.138 align:start position:0%
going to have two different documents
 
05:03:17.930 --> 05:03:17.940 align:start position:0%
no you're not you're going to have three
 
05:03:19.550 --> 05:03:19.560 align:start position:0%
different documents
 
05:03:21.288 --> 05:03:21.298 align:start position:0%
um msdaya
 
05:03:23.510 --> 05:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
you've given me two different amendments
 
05:03:30.288 --> 05:03:30.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:34.430 --> 05:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
okay and you were
 
05:03:36.708 --> 05:03:36.718 align:start position:0%
right there on the spot so you're going
 
05:03:38.868 --> 05:03:38.878 align:start position:0%
to get free documents
 
05:03:41.448 --> 05:03:41.458 align:start position:0%
and I just ask you to read them
 
05:03:45.050 --> 05:03:45.060 align:start position:0%
make little smiley faces all over them
 
05:03:45.060 --> 05:03:51.050 align:start position:0%
make little smiley faces all over them
doodle

05:03:51.050 --> 05:03:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:54.530 --> 05:03:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:57.948 --> 05:03:57.958 align:start position:0%
and it said somebody with his hand up
 
05:03:59.628 --> 05:03:59.638 align:start position:0%
well I don't see anybody with his hand
 
05:04:02.570 --> 05:04:02.580 align:start position:0%
up because I'm looking down but now once
 
05:04:05.150 --> 05:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
you have all three documents in front of
 
05:04:05.160 --> 05:04:06.350 align:start position:0%
you have all three documents in front of
you

05:04:06.350 --> 05:04:06.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:04:08.270 --> 05:04:08.280 align:start position:0%
the kindly gentleman with his hand up
 
05:04:18.050 --> 05:04:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:21.310 --> 05:04:21.320 align:start position:0%
instead of finances
 
05:04:28.610 --> 05:04:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:32.708 --> 05:04:32.718 align:start position:0%
so take the next 25 minutes or so and
 
05:04:34.750 --> 05:04:34.760 align:start position:0%
read through
 
05:04:44.830 --> 05:04:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:44.840 --> 05:04:46.390 align:start position:0%
 
if

05:04:46.390 --> 05:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:04:49.128 --> 05:04:49.138 align:start position:0%
this is a new bill we're looking at then
 
05:04:51.410 --> 05:04:51.420 align:start position:0%
I don't think we can are we not going to
 
05:04:53.930 --> 05:04:53.940 align:start position:0%
have a public hearing on 120. we are
 
05:04:55.910 --> 05:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
having a public hearing on the documents
 
05:04:58.010 --> 05:04:58.020 align:start position:0%
before us this is a very unusual thing
 
05:05:01.330 --> 05:05:01.340 align:start position:0%
yes I don't know how that can be if we
 
05:05:03.530 --> 05:05:03.540 align:start position:0%
if we advertise it we'll have a public
 
05:05:05.990 --> 05:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
hearing on 120 how we can jump into
 
05:05:07.670 --> 05:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
another bill
 
05:05:09.410 --> 05:05:09.420 align:start position:0%
we're going to do it without doing a
 
05:05:11.810 --> 05:05:11.820 align:start position:0%
without posting another
 
05:05:11.820 --> 05:05:14.230 align:start position:0%
without posting another
hearing

05:05:14.230 --> 05:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
05:05:16.190 --> 05:05:16.200 align:start position:0%
amendments we can do but I don't know if
 
05:05:17.690 --> 05:05:17.700 align:start position:0%
we can go to another bill particularly
 
05:05:19.430 --> 05:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
one from another chamber of the Senate
 
05:05:21.170 --> 05:05:21.180 align:start position:0%
without advertising we're going to hear
 
05:05:23.510 --> 05:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
another bill well I take what you've
 
05:05:25.190 --> 05:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
said under advisement and my ruling is
 
05:05:27.470 --> 05:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
we will do this and the only way we
 
05:05:29.810 --> 05:05:29.820 align:start position:0%
won't is by a challenge to the chair and
 
05:05:32.090 --> 05:05:32.100 align:start position:0%
I would not recommend it do what of the
 
05:05:34.128 --> 05:05:34.138 align:start position:0%
chair challenge of the ruling of the
 
05:05:38.090 --> 05:05:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:40.070 --> 05:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to discuss it this is going
 
05:05:42.948 --> 05:05:42.958 align:start position:0%
to be a discussion 120 as you know it is
 
05:05:45.410 --> 05:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
dead it is now followed by some other
 
05:05:50.810 --> 05:05:50.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:50.820 --> 05:05:52.128 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:05:52.128 --> 05:05:52.138 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:05:55.970 --> 05:05:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:57.948 --> 05:05:57.958 align:start position:0%
I mean these amendments haven't been
 
05:06:00.830 --> 05:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
noticed so I'm wondering
 
05:06:05.570 --> 05:06:05.580 align:start position:0%
if it's proper to uh
 
05:06:09.170 --> 05:06:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:10.910 --> 05:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
and it's properly even though these
 
05:06:13.128 --> 05:06:13.138 align:start position:0%
amendments haven't been noted
 
05:06:20.150 --> 05:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:22.850 --> 05:06:22.860 align:start position:0%
right you can't
 
05:06:50.390 --> 05:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:50.400 --> 05:06:51.650 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:06:51.650 --> 05:06:51.660 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:07:22.730 --> 05:07:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:22.740 --> 05:30:38.708 align:start position:0%
 
earlier

05:30:38.708 --> 05:30:38.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:38.718 --> 05:30:40.430 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:30:40.430 --> 05:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
05:30:42.970 --> 05:30:42.980 align:start position:0%
the hearing on House Bill
 
05:30:47.410 --> 05:30:47.420 align:start position:0%
120 on the sununu Youth Services Center
 
05:30:50.690 --> 05:30:50.700 align:start position:0%
and as we all know this is a work that's
 
05:30:52.610 --> 05:30:52.620 align:start position:0%
going at warp speed
 
05:30:57.050 --> 05:30:57.060 align:start position:0%
to try to accomplish some good work in a
 
05:30:59.690 --> 05:30:59.700 align:start position:0%
very short period of time and both the
 
05:31:02.868 --> 05:31:02.878 align:start position:0%
house and the Senate are working on this
 
05:31:05.750 --> 05:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
and we hope to have something on the
 
05:31:07.788 --> 05:31:07.798 align:start position:0%
governor's desk in four to six weeks
 
05:31:11.030 --> 05:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes the chairman of
 
05:31:14.390 --> 05:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
division three of Finance
 
05:31:17.150 --> 05:31:17.160 align:start position:0%
the representative Jesse Edwards who is
 
05:31:20.708 --> 05:31:20.718 align:start position:0%
going to present his bill and comment on
 
05:31:24.410 --> 05:31:24.420 align:start position:0%
the amendment to it to make sure that
 
05:31:26.150 --> 05:31:26.160 align:start position:0%
we're getting the latest updates
 
05:31:29.030 --> 05:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh thank you Mr
 
05:31:30.708 --> 05:31:30.718 align:start position:0%
chair for the record I'm representative
 
05:31:32.628 --> 05:31:32.638 align:start position:0%
Jess Edwards representing Rock cam
 
05:31:35.990 --> 05:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
District 31. I live in Auburn but
 
05:31:38.890 --> 05:31:38.900 align:start position:0%
represent three other towns as well
 
05:31:42.350 --> 05:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
I have been tracking on the sununu issue
 
05:31:45.590 --> 05:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
for quite a while I was appointed to a
 
05:31:47.890 --> 05:31:47.900 align:start position:0%
special committee that was chaired by
 
05:31:51.170 --> 05:31:51.180 align:start position:0%
Senator Gary Daniels to take a look at
 
05:31:52.990 --> 05:31:53.000 align:start position:0%
options for
 
05:31:55.930 --> 05:31:55.940 align:start position:0%
closing and replacing the sununu center
 
05:31:58.550 --> 05:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
we did a lot of work on that published
 
05:32:02.690 --> 05:32:02.700 align:start position:0%
final report I plus plus this this hit
 
05:32:06.730 --> 05:32:06.740 align:start position:0%
division three after it passed the house
 
05:32:08.708 --> 05:32:08.718 align:start position:0%
last year
 
05:32:14.330 --> 05:32:14.340 align:start position:0%
and and so so we had a pretty good bill
 
05:32:17.410 --> 05:32:17.420 align:start position:0%
that we took into committee a conference
 
05:32:21.050 --> 05:32:21.060 align:start position:0%
and there was I I'd call it
 
05:32:24.590 --> 05:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
miscommunication and the the the the the
 
05:32:27.110 --> 05:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
the Fatal flaw in the miscommunication
 
05:32:30.830 --> 05:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
is that the the bill to replace the
 
05:32:32.810 --> 05:32:32.820 align:start position:0%
sununu center died in committee
 
05:32:35.750 --> 05:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
conference and that was a really bad
 
05:32:39.230 --> 05:32:39.240 align:start position:0%
thing because as it left our current law
 
05:32:41.810 --> 05:32:41.820 align:start position:0%
to say that
 
05:32:44.990 --> 05:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
um the sununu center must close on the
 
05:32:47.750 --> 05:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
1st of March and so those of you with
 
05:32:49.788 --> 05:32:49.798 align:start position:0%
the calendar clicking in your head you
 
05:32:53.110 --> 05:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
know that's like five weeks from now
 
05:32:56.208 --> 05:32:56.218 align:start position:0%
we have looked at alternatives on what
 
05:33:00.288 --> 05:33:00.298 align:start position:0%
to do with these kids one of them just
 
05:33:02.750 --> 05:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
to give you a worst case scenario one of
 
05:33:06.590 --> 05:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
them is uh is uh being detained because
 
05:33:10.490 --> 05:33:10.500 align:start position:0%
of uh allegation of murdering parents
 
05:33:14.150 --> 05:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
so these can be pretty serious cases in
 
05:33:18.110 --> 05:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
there and uh and and it isn't really
 
05:33:20.150 --> 05:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
clear to me what happens on one March if
 
05:33:22.070 --> 05:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
we don't pass something
 
05:33:24.350 --> 05:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
um I I I don't think the commissioner
 
05:33:26.570 --> 05:33:26.580 align:start position:0%
has good Alternatives and it may include
 
05:33:28.850 --> 05:33:28.860 align:start position:0%
having to send some kids out of state
 
05:33:30.890 --> 05:33:30.900 align:start position:0%
could cost a lot of money to do that
 
05:33:32.990 --> 05:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
could could could be bad for their
 
05:33:33.000 --> 05:33:34.070 align:start position:0%
could could could be bad for their
therapy

05:33:34.070 --> 05:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
therapy
 
05:33:34.080 --> 05:33:35.448 align:start position:0%
therapy
so

05:33:35.448 --> 05:33:35.458 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:33:39.410 --> 05:33:39.420 align:start position:0%
um so what I'm really imploring this
 
05:33:42.230 --> 05:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
committee to do is to understand that
 
05:33:45.948 --> 05:33:45.958 align:start position:0%
we're on a very short window here and
 
05:33:49.610 --> 05:33:49.620 align:start position:0%
that the people who disagreed in the
 
05:33:52.010 --> 05:33:52.020 align:start position:0%
committee of conference last year are
 
05:33:53.990 --> 05:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
either completely in sync with one
 
05:33:57.948 --> 05:33:57.958 align:start position:0%
another now or are no longer serving so
 
05:34:02.150 --> 05:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
we um So based on some of that I I wrote
 
05:34:05.330 --> 05:34:05.340 align:start position:0%
HB 120
 
05:34:08.930 --> 05:34:08.940 align:start position:0%
um simultaneously there was an sb1 done
 
05:34:11.330 --> 05:34:11.340 align:start position:0%
by Senator Carson
 
05:34:14.208 --> 05:34:14.218 align:start position:0%
um she had me work on an amendment for
 
05:34:17.090 --> 05:34:17.100 align:start position:0%
her which is how closely I share that
 
05:34:18.650 --> 05:34:18.660 align:start position:0%
just to let you know how closely we've
 
05:34:20.448 --> 05:34:20.458 align:start position:0%
been working with one another she asked
 
05:34:23.448 --> 05:34:23.458 align:start position:0%
me to to write an amendment that took
 
05:34:25.490 --> 05:34:25.500 align:start position:0%
some of the best part of hers and the
 
05:34:28.610 --> 05:34:28.620 align:start position:0%
best part of mine and build one and so
 
05:34:33.530 --> 05:34:33.540 align:start position:0%
so although I'm introducing HP 120 today
 
05:34:37.090 --> 05:34:37.100 align:start position:0%
I would I would draw your attention to
 
05:34:40.750 --> 05:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
amendment to HP 120
 
05:34:40.760 --> 05:34:44.288 align:start position:0%
amendment to HP 120
to

05:34:44.288 --> 05:34:44.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:48.288 --> 05:34:48.298 align:start position:0%
2023-084 hotel and that I think that has
 
05:34:51.530 --> 05:34:51.540 align:start position:0%
all been distributed before today
 
05:34:54.430 --> 05:34:54.440 align:start position:0%
um and so this was an amendment
 
05:35:00.288 --> 05:35:00.298 align:start position:0%
that is a replace all of HB 120 with
 
05:35:04.430 --> 05:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
this document so HB 120 as we used to
 
05:35:06.708 --> 05:35:06.718 align:start position:0%
say in the military is Obe it's been
 
05:35:10.910 --> 05:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
overcome by events uh the the version uh
 
05:35:13.730 --> 05:35:13.740 align:start position:0%
that that we're going after now in the
 
05:35:16.970 --> 05:35:16.980 align:start position:0%
in the house is this amendment which
 
05:35:22.190 --> 05:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
mirrors what the Senate passed 22-2 and
 
05:35:24.110 --> 05:35:24.120 align:start position:0%
and one of the vital things we're doing
 
05:35:27.288 --> 05:35:27.298 align:start position:0%
and have to do is we Fast Track This is
 
05:35:29.868 --> 05:35:29.878 align:start position:0%
we have to keep this the the both houses
 
05:35:33.288 --> 05:35:33.298 align:start position:0%
uh in sync with one another because if
 
05:35:35.750 --> 05:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
we get out of sync and all the way down
 
05:35:38.330 --> 05:35:38.340 align:start position:0%
to a comma they have to be identical to
 
05:35:41.570 --> 05:35:41.580 align:start position:0%
help us facilitate rapid approval by
 
05:35:43.070 --> 05:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
both houses and getting it to the
 
05:35:45.170 --> 05:35:45.180 align:start position:0%
governor that that's really that's
 
05:35:47.448 --> 05:35:47.458 align:start position:0%
really where we
 
05:35:50.448 --> 05:35:50.458 align:start position:0%
achieve our success criteria is to get
 
05:35:52.610 --> 05:35:52.620 align:start position:0%
the governor to sign this before the end
 
05:35:55.128 --> 05:35:55.138 align:start position:0%
of February so that the one March
 
05:35:57.948 --> 05:35:57.958 align:start position:0%
closure date is obviated
 
05:35:57.958 --> 05:35:59.150 align:start position:0%
closure date is obviated
so

05:35:59.150 --> 05:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:36:02.030 --> 05:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
um so with that I I will begin to talk
 
05:36:04.550 --> 05:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
about some of the more interesting
 
05:36:08.930 --> 05:36:08.940 align:start position:0%
aspects of of the amendment
 
05:36:11.750 --> 05:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
um and although much of this is
 
05:36:14.690 --> 05:36:14.700 align:start position:0%
consistent with HB 120 I I just think
 
05:36:17.448 --> 05:36:17.458 align:start position:0%
for the committee's purpose it would be
 
05:36:20.150 --> 05:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
worth highlighting these and and I
 
05:36:23.090 --> 05:36:23.100 align:start position:0%
should have mentioned that the committee
 
05:36:25.970 --> 05:36:25.980 align:start position:0%
had a chair had invited division three
 
05:36:29.570 --> 05:36:29.580 align:start position:0%
to to join us and could you raise your
 
05:36:31.250 --> 05:36:31.260 align:start position:0%
hand if you're division three so I could
 
05:36:31.260 --> 05:36:33.288 align:start position:0%
hand if you're division three so I could
one

05:36:33.288 --> 05:36:33.298 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:36:35.930 --> 05:36:35.940 align:start position:0%
okay and and thank you thank you for
 
05:36:39.110 --> 05:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
coming uh I I wanted division three to
 
05:36:41.750 --> 05:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
be paying attention to the questions and
 
05:36:45.230 --> 05:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
the and the introduction of this so that
 
05:36:48.230 --> 05:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
um we're better prepared as a finance
 
05:36:51.770 --> 05:36:51.780 align:start position:0%
committee to receive this product once
 
05:36:54.350 --> 05:36:54.360 align:start position:0%
if it clears the house that we can we
 
05:36:57.470 --> 05:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
can handle it more quickly so
 
05:36:57.480 --> 05:36:59.510 align:start position:0%
can handle it more quickly so
um

05:36:59.510 --> 05:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:03.110 --> 05:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
the main issue in committee a conference
 
05:37:06.670 --> 05:37:06.680 align:start position:0%
was the capacity some people wanted six
 
05:37:11.390 --> 05:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
uh others wanted to plan the facility to
 
05:37:14.390 --> 05:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
be able to operationally intend to
 
05:37:18.708 --> 05:37:18.718 align:start position:0%
support 12 with a maximum ability to
 
05:37:24.010 --> 05:37:24.020 align:start position:0%
handle 18 for sort of exigent reasons
 
05:37:28.128 --> 05:37:28.138 align:start position:0%
I was talking to the director just a
 
05:37:31.730 --> 05:37:31.740 align:start position:0%
little while ago and uh and and although
 
05:37:35.330 --> 05:37:35.340 align:start position:0%
I had known that our census is has
 
05:37:38.208 --> 05:37:38.218 align:start position:0%
ranged very in a very kind of consistent
 
05:37:41.690 --> 05:37:41.700 align:start position:0%
manner around 12 to 14 he mentioned to
 
05:37:44.150 --> 05:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
me that we hit 18 for the first time in
 
05:37:47.390 --> 05:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
a couple of years so so to me I'm I
 
05:37:50.330 --> 05:37:50.340 align:start position:0%
think it's validated that the 12 with
 
05:37:54.770 --> 05:37:54.780 align:start position:0%
the potential to go up to 18 is is is a
 
05:37:59.330 --> 05:37:59.340 align:start position:0%
good census data-driven Target now in
 
05:38:02.830 --> 05:38:02.840 align:start position:0%
order to maximize the use of that space
 
05:38:06.110 --> 05:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
we're asking that the the Interior Space
 
05:38:08.990 --> 05:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
be designed so that there's some
 
05:38:11.750 --> 05:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
flexibility so like for example if
 
05:38:14.750 --> 05:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
you've got a combination of men and
 
05:38:18.170 --> 05:38:18.180 align:start position:0%
women in there it's easier to divide the
 
05:38:20.690 --> 05:38:20.700 align:start position:0%
you know the sleeping areas and the
 
05:38:23.890 --> 05:38:23.900 align:start position:0%
common areas as appropriate if you have
 
05:38:28.250 --> 05:38:28.260 align:start position:0%
members of competing gangs for example
 
05:38:31.070 --> 05:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
it would be easier to segregate them to
 
05:38:33.650 --> 05:38:33.660 align:start position:0%
increase safety so so the design is
 
05:38:37.368 --> 05:38:37.378 align:start position:0%
going to have to create or be capable of
 
05:38:39.650 --> 05:38:39.660 align:start position:0%
being somewhat flexible
 
05:38:42.230 --> 05:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
now the location of where this thing
 
05:38:47.510 --> 05:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
goes is a topic of a lot of rumor and
 
05:38:47.520 --> 05:38:48.550 align:start position:0%
goes is a topic of a lot of rumor and
concern

05:38:48.550 --> 05:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
concern
 
05:38:51.288 --> 05:38:51.298 align:start position:0%
three places have been named I'll let
 
05:38:53.208 --> 05:38:53.218 align:start position:0%
the director talk about that but I just
 
05:38:54.948 --> 05:38:54.958 align:start position:0%
want to tell you that from the
 
05:38:58.128 --> 05:38:58.138 align:start position:0%
legislation's perspective we presume
 
05:39:01.310 --> 05:39:01.320 align:start position:0%
that a location has not yet been picked
 
05:39:03.470 --> 05:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
there are there are some good ideas on
 
05:39:06.470 --> 05:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
where it may go but but officially and
 
05:39:10.550 --> 05:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
technically no place has been picked yet
 
05:39:14.510 --> 05:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
um so but because there are Community
 
05:39:18.310 --> 05:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
concerns if you drop down to line 23
 
05:39:21.470 --> 05:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
you'll note that this amendment says
 
05:39:23.628 --> 05:39:23.638 align:start position:0%
that we will Implement any reasonable
 
05:39:25.730 --> 05:39:25.740 align:start position:0%
requests by the communities to ensure
 
05:39:29.150 --> 05:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
safe operation of the facility that is
 
05:39:31.310 --> 05:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
future work that is work to be done
 
05:39:33.948 --> 05:39:33.958 align:start position:0%
after you know we get deeper into the
 
05:39:37.250 --> 05:39:37.260 align:start position:0%
site selection mode it's it's premature
 
05:39:40.128 --> 05:39:40.138 align:start position:0%
to have done that at this point another
 
05:39:42.110 --> 05:39:42.120 align:start position:0%
key point and I know this is really
 
05:39:45.708 --> 05:39:45.718 align:start position:0%
important to The Advocates is is covered
 
05:39:50.390 --> 05:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
at line 25 and 26 at the end of 20 line
 
05:39:53.690 --> 05:39:53.700 align:start position:0%
25 it says the facility shall not be
 
05:39:56.030 --> 05:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
administered by any non-governmental
 
05:39:58.970 --> 05:39:58.980 align:start position:0%
entity what does that mean there there
 
05:40:01.788 --> 05:40:01.798 align:start position:0%
was there has been discussion because
 
05:40:03.590 --> 05:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
it's important to discuss all
 
05:40:06.050 --> 05:40:06.060 align:start position:0%
Alternatives there has been discussion
 
05:40:08.330 --> 05:40:08.340 align:start position:0%
about well should we consider
 
05:40:11.448 --> 05:40:11.458 align:start position:0%
Contracting the entire operation out to
 
05:40:15.350 --> 05:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
uh a for-profit entity that runs these
 
05:40:18.530 --> 05:40:18.540 align:start position:0%
kinds of things and categorically every
 
05:40:21.530 --> 05:40:21.540 align:start position:0%
conclusion has been no we do not want to
 
05:40:24.350 --> 05:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
do that we will not do that and so so
 
05:40:27.830 --> 05:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
what what 25 is meant to say is given
 
05:40:30.288 --> 05:40:30.298 align:start position:0%
that it shall not be an administered by
 
05:40:32.750 --> 05:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
any non-governmental entity it goes on
 
05:40:35.390 --> 05:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
to say it shall be administered by the
 
05:40:37.070 --> 05:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
05:40:40.490 --> 05:40:40.500 align:start position:0%
now keep in mind that the location is
 
05:40:42.350 --> 05:40:42.360 align:start position:0%
being considered are on State Property
 
05:40:44.470 --> 05:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
it's going to be built with State money
 
05:40:48.770 --> 05:40:48.780 align:start position:0%
it's going to be in law administered by
 
05:40:49.970 --> 05:40:49.980 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
05:40:52.788 --> 05:40:52.798 align:start position:0%
Services and so for those who may be
 
05:40:55.990 --> 05:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
concerned about the ownership or control
 
05:40:58.788 --> 05:40:58.798 align:start position:0%
I I believe it's pretty clear that the
 
05:41:01.490 --> 05:41:01.500 align:start position:0%
legislative intent is that this is uh
 
05:41:04.250 --> 05:41:04.260 align:start position:0%
the state the state is accountable and
 
05:41:07.250 --> 05:41:07.260 align:start position:0%
is responsible for making sure that all
 
05:41:11.390 --> 05:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
operations are are done properly now
 
05:41:14.090 --> 05:41:14.100 align:start position:0%
we'll see later but it's it's it's good
 
05:41:16.550 --> 05:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
to mention now that
 
05:41:16.560 --> 05:41:17.270 align:start position:0%
to mention now that
um

05:41:17.270 --> 05:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:20.030 --> 05:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
one of the drivers for wanting to close
 
05:41:21.948 --> 05:41:21.958 align:start position:0%
the current's new new center
 
05:41:24.650 --> 05:41:24.660 align:start position:0%
is because there has been frustration
 
05:41:28.250 --> 05:41:28.260 align:start position:0%
over building for maybe 10 years that
 
05:41:30.890 --> 05:41:30.900 align:start position:0%
the sununu center is pretty expensive on
 
05:41:33.350 --> 05:41:33.360 align:start position:0%
a on an annual basis we spent about 13
 
05:41:35.750 --> 05:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year you can do the
 
05:41:38.330 --> 05:41:38.340 align:start position:0%
quick math if you've got census of 12 to
 
05:41:41.150 --> 05:41:41.160 align:start position:0%
14 what that works out to be now it's
 
05:41:44.750 --> 05:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
not the same 12 to 14 year round it's
 
05:41:46.970 --> 05:41:46.980 align:start position:0%
there's there's movement in and out of
 
05:41:49.310 --> 05:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
the facility but the the daily average
 
05:41:52.070 --> 05:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
census tends to stay between 12 and 14.
 
05:41:54.350 --> 05:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
13 million dollars a year that's quite a
 
05:41:57.250 --> 05:41:57.260 align:start position:0%
lot so we think we can do
 
05:42:01.430 --> 05:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
a a more efficient job in a facility
 
05:42:05.330 --> 05:42:05.340 align:start position:0%
built and designed to create a
 
05:42:08.208 --> 05:42:08.218 align:start position:0%
therapeutic environment when we first
 
05:42:12.110 --> 05:42:12.120 align:start position:0%
built the 144 person facility that we're
 
05:42:13.868 --> 05:42:13.878 align:start position:0%
currently in
 
05:42:17.690 --> 05:42:17.700 align:start position:0%
144. what we built that for was more of
 
05:42:20.570 --> 05:42:20.580 align:start position:0%
a juvenile incarceration Center the
 
05:42:24.050 --> 05:42:24.060 align:start position:0%
model was very much about jail and and
 
05:42:26.628 --> 05:42:26.638 align:start position:0%
imprisonment and what this legislation
 
05:42:29.448 --> 05:42:29.458 align:start position:0%
does is it says it's it's going to be
 
05:42:32.030 --> 05:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
the policy of the state to to worry
 
05:42:34.850 --> 05:42:34.860 align:start position:0%
about the therapeutic treatment of these
 
05:42:37.330 --> 05:42:37.340 align:start position:0%
kids and the you know basically the
 
05:42:40.730 --> 05:42:40.740 align:start position:0%
restoration of them back to civil
 
05:42:40.740 --> 05:42:44.270 align:start position:0%
restoration of them back to civil
Behavior

05:42:44.270 --> 05:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:47.330 --> 05:42:47.340 align:start position:0%
um if you go to the next page page two
 
05:42:50.628 --> 05:42:50.638 align:start position:0%
very first line it's mentioned that once
 
05:42:52.730 --> 05:42:52.740 align:start position:0%
we we open the new facility it'll be
 
05:42:55.610 --> 05:42:55.620 align:start position:0%
called the YDC and not the sununu Youth
 
05:42:58.190 --> 05:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
Development Center I've gotten feedback
 
05:43:00.590 --> 05:43:00.600 align:start position:0%
by interested parties that they don't
 
05:43:05.330 --> 05:43:05.340 align:start position:0%
like YDC and and rather than introduce a
 
05:43:07.430 --> 05:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
little bit of chaos between keeping the
 
05:43:10.010 --> 05:43:10.020 align:start position:0%
Senate and the house in sync what I've
 
05:43:12.890 --> 05:43:12.900 align:start position:0%
what I've asked is for these things that
 
05:43:15.770 --> 05:43:15.780 align:start position:0%
are rarely not relevant to pushing out
 
05:43:17.868 --> 05:43:17.878 align:start position:0%
the the deadline and getting them
 
05:43:21.288 --> 05:43:21.298 align:start position:0%
started on on architectural design let's
 
05:43:23.810 --> 05:43:23.820 align:start position:0%
let's let's keep that separate so that
 
05:43:27.230 --> 05:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
we can pass a bill in January of 2024 or
 
05:43:29.390 --> 05:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
at least begin to the naming of the
 
05:43:32.750 --> 05:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
facility is not on the critical path I
 
05:43:34.970 --> 05:43:34.980 align:start position:0%
don't think and I I hope you would agree
 
05:43:38.030 --> 05:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
with that as soon as the new center is
 
05:43:40.190 --> 05:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
open on line seven it basically says
 
05:43:42.650 --> 05:43:42.660 align:start position:0%
we're going to close the old system for
 
05:43:46.310 --> 05:43:46.320 align:start position:0%
detention or admissions
 
05:43:49.670 --> 05:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
um starting on line 10 it talks about
 
05:43:53.208 --> 05:43:53.218 align:start position:0%
some facility design issues uh Alpha
 
05:43:53.218 --> 05:43:54.490 align:start position:0%
some facility design issues uh Alpha
through

05:43:54.490 --> 05:43:54.500 align:start position:0%
through
 
05:44:00.230 --> 05:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
India down from lines 10 to 26. I think
 
05:44:03.650 --> 05:44:03.660 align:start position:0%
the first bullet is critical that we
 
05:44:05.628 --> 05:44:05.638 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do is complement a
 
05:44:08.628 --> 05:44:08.638 align:start position:0%
therapeutic and trauma-informed care of
 
05:44:11.750 --> 05:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
the children there to try to make it a
 
05:44:14.030 --> 05:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
home-like interior and exterior to the
 
05:44:18.410 --> 05:44:18.420 align:start position:0%
maximum extent practical now the
 
05:44:21.048 --> 05:44:21.058 align:start position:0%
um that this also has to be done to make
 
05:44:23.750 --> 05:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
sure that physical security is is
 
05:44:26.868 --> 05:44:26.878 align:start position:0%
clearly in place and that these kids are
 
05:44:30.650 --> 05:44:30.660 align:start position:0%
are detained in a controlled environment
 
05:44:33.410 --> 05:44:33.420 align:start position:0%
where they cannot leave the premises
 
05:44:36.530 --> 05:44:36.540 align:start position:0%
without proper authorization and escort
 
05:44:39.230 --> 05:44:39.240 align:start position:0%
and the like so
 
05:44:42.110 --> 05:44:42.120 align:start position:0%
um so so one of the major transition
 
05:44:44.208 --> 05:44:44.218 align:start position:0%
points that you don't really see in this
 
05:44:44.218 --> 05:44:45.048 align:start position:0%
points that you don't really see in this
bill

05:44:45.048 --> 05:44:45.058 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:44:50.270 --> 05:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
is that SB 14 back in 2019 which has
 
05:44:53.650 --> 05:44:53.660 align:start position:0%
since become law established an acronym
 
05:44:57.650 --> 05:44:57.660 align:start position:0%
cat and I think that's a comprehensive
 
05:44:57.660 --> 05:44:59.570 align:start position:0%
cat and I think that's a comprehensive
assessment

05:44:59.570 --> 05:44:59.580 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
05:45:01.090 --> 05:45:01.100 align:start position:0%
therapy plan
 
05:45:03.590 --> 05:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
treatment plan
 
05:45:07.610 --> 05:45:07.620 align:start position:0%
um and so so the cat is something that
 
05:45:12.010 --> 05:45:12.020 align:start position:0%
is an assessment of uh of somebody who
 
05:45:14.590 --> 05:45:14.600 align:start position:0%
contacts the behavioral health system
 
05:45:19.490 --> 05:45:19.500 align:start position:0%
and needs some some treatment plans and
 
05:45:22.670 --> 05:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
so some portion of the the kids that end
 
05:45:26.270 --> 05:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
up at the new YDC are going to have
 
05:45:29.510 --> 05:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
these initial assessments and so so
 
05:45:32.048 --> 05:45:32.058 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to hit the ground running
 
05:45:33.910 --> 05:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
in theory
 
05:45:37.368 --> 05:45:37.378 align:start position:0%
that with the continuity of care for
 
05:45:40.070 --> 05:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
what what these youth need
 
05:45:42.708 --> 05:45:42.718 align:start position:0%
that's different than if you had walked
 
05:45:46.490 --> 05:45:46.500 align:start position:0%
in a a year ago to see what happened all
 
05:45:48.890 --> 05:45:48.900 align:start position:0%
the initial assessment and stuff took
 
05:45:51.890 --> 05:45:51.900 align:start position:0%
place on day one and it wasn't until
 
05:45:55.250 --> 05:45:55.260 align:start position:0%
later that it was clear what kind of a
 
05:45:57.368 --> 05:45:57.378 align:start position:0%
treatment plan was appropriate
 
05:46:01.128 --> 05:46:01.138 align:start position:0%
and there was not a connection to the
 
05:46:03.410 --> 05:46:03.420 align:start position:0%
community and so
 
05:46:05.750 --> 05:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
um so I think one of the things that we
 
05:46:07.850 --> 05:46:07.860 align:start position:0%
have going in our favor and this
 
05:46:09.890 --> 05:46:09.900 align:start position:0%
redesign is that it's anticipated the
 
05:46:12.590 --> 05:46:12.600 align:start position:0%
integration with the system of care tied
 
05:46:15.288 --> 05:46:15.298 align:start position:0%
together by this cat and so that when
 
05:46:18.530 --> 05:46:18.540 align:start position:0%
they get to the new YDC we're going to
 
05:46:20.810 --> 05:46:20.820 align:start position:0%
be working on a therapeutic and
 
05:46:24.110 --> 05:46:24.120 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed Care basis so so so so
 
05:46:26.930 --> 05:46:26.940 align:start position:0%
so that's uh so that's good and and
 
05:46:30.548 --> 05:46:30.558 align:start position:0%
later if you jump down the line 28
 
05:46:34.128 --> 05:46:34.138 align:start position:0%
it'll it says operations May utilize
 
05:46:37.670 --> 05:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
virtual and shared services so what the
 
05:46:39.470 --> 05:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
hope is there and what the
 
05:46:42.170 --> 05:46:42.180 align:start position:0%
communications have been is that
 
05:46:47.448 --> 05:46:47.458 align:start position:0%
telemedicine can be used to link the the
 
05:46:50.990 --> 05:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
youth that are at the YDC back with
 
05:46:53.030 --> 05:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
their Community providers so that
 
05:46:56.090 --> 05:46:56.100 align:start position:0%
there's more continuity and and that
 
05:46:58.970 --> 05:46:58.980 align:start position:0%
should result in a better outcome
 
05:47:02.868 --> 05:47:02.878 align:start position:0%
um so the but but the telemedicine is
 
05:47:04.670 --> 05:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
not the only thing that can be delivered
 
05:47:07.128 --> 05:47:07.138 align:start position:0%
with a remote or virtual Services as
 
05:47:08.810 --> 05:47:08.820 align:start position:0%
we've learned the last couple of years
 
05:47:12.288 --> 05:47:12.298 align:start position:0%
you know educational augmentation may be
 
05:47:14.890 --> 05:47:14.900 align:start position:0%
a possibility
 
05:47:18.948 --> 05:47:18.958 align:start position:0%
nice interaction with their family who
 
05:47:20.510 --> 05:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
may not be able to travel to the center
 
05:47:24.230 --> 05:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
but can still engage with them using you
 
05:47:26.410 --> 05:47:26.420 align:start position:0%
know good high-end
 
05:47:26.420 --> 05:47:28.090 align:start position:0%
know good high-end
equipment

05:47:28.090 --> 05:47:28.100 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
05:47:31.730 --> 05:47:31.740 align:start position:0%
so so emphasizing the virtual
 
05:47:35.090 --> 05:47:35.100 align:start position:0%
and now on the shared side if we can
 
05:47:37.190 --> 05:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
co-locate this facility with another
 
05:47:39.650 --> 05:47:39.660 align:start position:0%
facility that is operating under
 
05:47:42.350 --> 05:47:42.360 align:start position:0%
essentially the same model
 
05:47:45.590 --> 05:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
that opens up the possibility of sharing
 
05:47:48.650 --> 05:47:48.660 align:start position:0%
services like one of the most scarce
 
05:47:51.170 --> 05:47:51.180 align:start position:0%
things we have in this state are trained
 
05:47:54.470 --> 05:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
Manpower and so so by having a
 
05:47:57.230 --> 05:47:57.240 align:start position:0%
co-location with a similar facility it's
 
05:48:00.170 --> 05:48:00.180 align:start position:0%
hoped that any Manpower shortages might
 
05:48:03.590 --> 05:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
be able to be compensated for by having
 
05:48:06.708 --> 05:48:06.718 align:start position:0%
better sharing Arrangements but but the
 
05:48:08.570 --> 05:48:08.580 align:start position:0%
care model isn't the only part that can
 
05:48:10.730 --> 05:48:10.740 align:start position:0%
be shared you can share very fundamental
 
05:48:13.090 --> 05:48:13.100 align:start position:0%
things like laundry services
 
05:48:17.170 --> 05:48:17.180 align:start position:0%
warehouse and Logistics Services
 
05:48:20.868 --> 05:48:20.878 align:start position:0%
you can share some security services so
 
05:48:25.190 --> 05:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
so by emphasizing that the plan should
 
05:48:28.010 --> 05:48:28.020 align:start position:0%
include virtual and shared services what
 
05:48:30.350 --> 05:48:30.360 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do particularly with the
 
05:48:32.390 --> 05:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
capacity reduction of an operational
 
05:48:34.850 --> 05:48:34.860 align:start position:0%
size of 12 is we're trying to
 
05:48:38.810 --> 05:48:38.820 align:start position:0%
dramatically shift that cost basis from
 
05:48:41.810 --> 05:48:41.820 align:start position:0%
13 million dollars a year to a much
 
05:48:43.670 --> 05:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
lower number and I'm not prepared to
 
05:48:46.670 --> 05:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
give you an estimate but I I've got to
 
05:48:49.730 --> 05:48:49.740 align:start position:0%
imagine it's it'll be on the order of a
 
05:48:53.090 --> 05:48:53.100 align:start position:0%
third of what it is now the director may
 
05:48:56.810 --> 05:48:56.820 align:start position:0%
have a better wag than me but a lot of
 
05:48:58.730 --> 05:48:58.740 align:start position:0%
this analysis hasn't been done but it's
 
05:49:01.190 --> 05:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
just got to be less expensive
 
05:49:01.200 --> 05:49:02.510 align:start position:0%
just got to be less expensive
so

05:49:02.510 --> 05:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:49:02.520 --> 05:49:05.390 align:start position:0%
so
um

05:49:05.390 --> 05:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:07.970 --> 05:49:07.980 align:start position:0%
for the community that receives this I
 
05:49:11.390 --> 05:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
think line H is important line h on line
 
05:49:11.400 --> 05:49:12.430 align:start position:0%
think line H is important line h on line
24

05:49:12.430 --> 05:49:12.440 align:start position:0%
24
 
05:49:15.170 --> 05:49:15.180 align:start position:0%
where it says necessary elements to be
 
05:49:16.850 --> 05:49:16.860 align:start position:0%
architecturally secure and equipped with
 
05:49:18.770 --> 05:49:18.780 align:start position:0%
video surveillance in compliance with
 
05:49:22.250 --> 05:49:22.260 align:start position:0%
that RSA statute what that RSA statute
 
05:49:24.770 --> 05:49:24.780 align:start position:0%
is is something that the legislature
 
05:49:26.930 --> 05:49:26.940 align:start position:0%
passed last year and was signed into law
 
05:49:29.810 --> 05:49:29.820 align:start position:0%
which says that their their shell was
 
05:49:31.850 --> 05:49:31.860 align:start position:0%
essentially it says there shall be no
 
05:49:34.670 --> 05:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
blind spots so wherever there's a common
 
05:49:34.680 --> 05:49:35.708 align:start position:0%
blind spots so wherever there's a common
area

05:49:35.708 --> 05:49:35.718 align:start position:0%
area
 
05:49:40.070 --> 05:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
it's it's capable of having the Acuity
 
05:49:43.548 --> 05:49:43.558 align:start position:0%
to pick up individuals to know who's who
 
05:49:45.948 --> 05:49:45.958 align:start position:0%
and to be able to monitor behavior in
 
05:49:49.310 --> 05:49:49.320 align:start position:0%
common areas now of course the privacy
 
05:49:51.410 --> 05:49:51.420 align:start position:0%
concerns are also built into this you
 
05:49:54.350 --> 05:49:54.360 align:start position:0%
don't want to have you know bathrooms in
 
05:49:56.628 --> 05:49:56.638 align:start position:0%
the wrong place or excuse me cameras in
 
05:49:58.730 --> 05:49:58.740 align:start position:0%
the wrong place in the bathroom or in
 
05:50:01.670 --> 05:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
their bedrooms for example but but I'm
 
05:50:03.410 --> 05:50:03.420 align:start position:0%
going to leave leave that to the
 
05:50:04.970 --> 05:50:04.980 align:start position:0%
engineers who are going to look at that
 
05:50:08.990 --> 05:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
lawn apply some real world expertise to
 
05:50:11.628 --> 05:50:11.638 align:start position:0%
giving us something we need that law
 
05:50:14.090 --> 05:50:14.100 align:start position:0%
also says that we are going to Archive
 
05:50:18.530 --> 05:50:18.540 align:start position:0%
these videos for years until the data
 
05:50:20.990 --> 05:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
retention period expires and that the
 
05:50:24.170 --> 05:50:24.180 align:start position:0%
equipment must maintain a 98 uptime or
 
05:50:27.048 --> 05:50:27.058 align:start position:0%
better that was done at the request of
 
05:50:30.708 --> 05:50:30.718 align:start position:0%
the AG himself who who has taken a look
 
05:50:33.530 --> 05:50:33.540 align:start position:0%
at our video evidence in cases in the
 
05:50:36.288 --> 05:50:36.298 align:start position:0%
last few years and realizes that our
 
05:50:38.628 --> 05:50:38.638 align:start position:0%
uptime isn't what it really needs to be
 
05:50:38.638 --> 05:50:40.190 align:start position:0%
uptime isn't what it really needs to be
so

05:50:40.190 --> 05:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:50:40.200 --> 05:50:43.070 align:start position:0%
so
um

05:50:43.070 --> 05:50:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:47.330 --> 05:50:47.340 align:start position:0%
we start into line 27 and 28 where it
 
05:50:49.850 --> 05:50:49.860 align:start position:0%
talks about staff qualifications I I
 
05:50:51.948 --> 05:50:51.958 align:start position:0%
think everyone in the community feels
 
05:50:54.368 --> 05:50:54.378 align:start position:0%
good that we're looking to primarily
 
05:50:58.930 --> 05:50:58.940 align:start position:0%
bring in therapeutic staff uh in here
 
05:51:01.788 --> 05:51:01.798 align:start position:0%
we're going to make sure that they are
 
05:51:04.910 --> 05:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
trained to also protect themselves and
 
05:51:06.890 --> 05:51:06.900 align:start position:0%
others in a group we're going to make
 
05:51:08.330 --> 05:51:08.340 align:start position:0%
sure that they're trained in
 
05:51:12.350 --> 05:51:12.360 align:start position:0%
de-escalation techniques so so that we
 
05:51:15.350 --> 05:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
can keep a safe environment internally
 
05:51:17.930 --> 05:51:17.940 align:start position:0%
for every individual and every employee
 
05:51:20.990 --> 05:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
and then also reduce the need for
 
05:51:24.230 --> 05:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
external law enforcement to get involved
 
05:51:26.628 --> 05:51:26.638 align:start position:0%
and reduce the anxiety the community
 
05:51:29.030 --> 05:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
that these people may leave the premises
 
05:51:32.030 --> 05:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
and become a threat to Public Safety so
 
05:51:34.970 --> 05:51:34.980 align:start position:0%
so that's going to be looked at
 
05:51:37.850 --> 05:51:37.860 align:start position:0%
um there has been some discussion that
 
05:51:40.430 --> 05:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
this bill this version of this amendment
 
05:51:42.470 --> 05:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't go far enough that we ought to
 
05:51:45.170 --> 05:51:45.180 align:start position:0%
get a commission together composed of uh
 
05:51:47.330 --> 05:51:47.340 align:start position:0%
some reps some Senators some local
 
05:51:51.948 --> 05:51:51.958 align:start position:0%
people uh to to Really build out a plan
 
05:51:55.070 --> 05:51:55.080 align:start position:0%
that you know dives into the procedures
 
05:51:58.190 --> 05:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
and practices that would be followed so
 
05:52:01.010 --> 05:52:01.020 align:start position:0%
so you don't see it in this version but
 
05:52:04.250 --> 05:52:04.260 align:start position:0%
I could anticipate that in uh that by
 
05:52:06.590 --> 05:52:06.600 align:start position:0%
the time this Fleet gets ready for the
 
05:52:09.890 --> 05:52:09.900 align:start position:0%
house floor the last time it will have
 
05:52:13.490 --> 05:52:13.500 align:start position:0%
Provisions for a commission to look at
 
05:52:15.770 --> 05:52:15.780 align:start position:0%
the security issues
 
05:52:15.780 --> 05:52:16.368 align:start position:0%
the security issues
um

05:52:16.368 --> 05:52:16.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:52:19.970 --> 05:52:19.980 align:start position:0%
you'll notice on page three
 
05:52:22.670 --> 05:52:22.680 align:start position:0%
on line three and four it talks about
 
05:52:25.070 --> 05:52:25.080 align:start position:0%
the wrap around support upon admission
 
05:52:27.890 --> 05:52:27.900 align:start position:0%
to plan for discharge so the whole
 
05:52:31.070 --> 05:52:31.080 align:start position:0%
system is being again to make the point
 
05:52:33.170 --> 05:52:33.180 align:start position:0%
this is being built on a therapeutic
 
05:52:36.410 --> 05:52:36.420 align:start position:0%
model where the the juveniles coming in
 
05:52:40.610 --> 05:52:40.620 align:start position:0%
should more than likely have some sort
 
05:52:42.470 --> 05:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
of contact with the behavioral health
 
05:52:45.490 --> 05:52:45.500 align:start position:0%
specialist and having this cat form
 
05:52:50.150 --> 05:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
come in to keeping them engaged with
 
05:52:53.270 --> 05:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
their providers during their stay to
 
05:52:55.850 --> 05:52:55.860 align:start position:0%
when they get discharged have a graceful
 
05:52:59.570 --> 05:52:59.580 align:start position:0%
transition of the discharge so so we're
 
05:53:01.788 --> 05:53:01.798 align:start position:0%
talk we're we're imagining an entire
 
05:53:04.610 --> 05:53:04.620 align:start position:0%
wraparound support system with the hope
 
05:53:07.448 --> 05:53:07.458 align:start position:0%
that this is going to
 
05:53:11.090 --> 05:53:11.100 align:start position:0%
improve the behavioral health aspects of
 
05:53:14.628 --> 05:53:14.638 align:start position:0%
each individual and certainly address
 
05:53:17.628 --> 05:53:17.638 align:start position:0%
some concerns about recidivism
 
05:53:19.910 --> 05:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
and I practice that word Hall last night
 
05:53:21.890 --> 05:53:21.900 align:start position:0%
I think I got it right
 
05:53:25.910 --> 05:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh recidivism okay so further on page
 
05:53:25.920 --> 05:53:27.288 align:start position:0%
uh recidivism okay so further on page
three

05:53:27.288 --> 05:53:27.298 align:start position:0%
three
 
05:53:27.298 --> 05:53:28.010 align:start position:0%
three
um

05:53:28.010 --> 05:53:28.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:53:30.350 --> 05:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
we have
 
05:53:32.750 --> 05:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
a paragraph here
 
05:53:32.760 --> 05:53:34.190 align:start position:0%
a paragraph here
that

05:53:34.190 --> 05:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:53:37.250 --> 05:53:37.260 align:start position:0%
um is is is pretty good about telling
 
05:53:40.128 --> 05:53:40.138 align:start position:0%
the department what they need to do to
 
05:53:42.830 --> 05:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
give us quarterly reports
 
05:53:46.610 --> 05:53:46.620 align:start position:0%
um in in this in this version it says
 
05:53:48.350 --> 05:53:48.360 align:start position:0%
that those quarterly reports would go to
 
05:53:49.910 --> 05:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
the Joint legislative oversight
 
05:53:52.910 --> 05:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
committee and also to the office of the
 
05:53:55.010 --> 05:53:55.020 align:start position:0%
child advocate
 
05:53:58.190 --> 05:53:58.200 align:start position:0%
um and and then there was an aha moment
 
05:54:00.470 --> 05:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
where it should obviously also go to the
 
05:54:03.110 --> 05:54:03.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee so I can imagine that
 
05:54:05.628 --> 05:54:05.638 align:start position:0%
by the time this this gets ready to go
 
05:54:07.910 --> 05:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
to the house floor for the final time
 
05:54:10.190 --> 05:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
we're gonna we're gonna see
 
05:54:10.200 --> 05:54:10.788 align:start position:0%
we're gonna we're gonna see
um

05:54:10.788 --> 05:54:10.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:54:13.190 --> 05:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee mentioned as well
 
05:54:15.288 --> 05:54:15.298 align:start position:0%
we're also going to make sure that any
 
05:54:17.628 --> 05:54:17.638 align:start position:0%
money that we give them for this purpose
 
05:54:20.030 --> 05:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
can't be transferred into any other
 
05:54:23.390 --> 05:54:23.400 align:start position:0%
purpose that's not clear in this you
 
05:54:29.990 --> 05:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:32.288 --> 05:54:32.298 align:start position:0%
um I think of Interest maybe
 
05:54:35.270 --> 05:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
on page four
 
05:54:39.410 --> 05:54:39.420 align:start position:0%
um line 13 on down essentially what
 
05:54:42.250 --> 05:54:42.260 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do to the between
 
05:54:46.970 --> 05:54:46.980 align:start position:0%
13 and 22 is is uh to talk about
 
05:54:49.850 --> 05:54:49.860 align:start position:0%
potential disposal now when when we
 
05:54:52.730 --> 05:54:52.740 align:start position:0%
vacate the sununu center it's going to
 
05:54:55.070 --> 05:54:55.080 align:start position:0%
turn over to be under the control of the
 
05:54:56.690 --> 05:54:56.700 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative Services
 
05:54:58.910 --> 05:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
the administrative services department
 
05:55:01.128 --> 05:55:01.138 align:start position:0%
is going to start looking for the best
 
05:55:03.350 --> 05:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
alternative uses they may get a head
 
05:55:05.150 --> 05:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
start on it but officially that clock
 
05:55:07.010 --> 05:55:07.020 align:start position:0%
doesn't start until they become
 
05:55:09.230 --> 05:55:09.240 align:start position:0%
accountable and and what this
 
05:55:12.170 --> 05:55:12.180 align:start position:0%
legislation does is it encourages a
 
05:55:14.390 --> 05:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
prioritization of having that key
 
05:55:16.250 --> 05:55:16.260 align:start position:0%
property if you've never been to the
 
05:55:18.430 --> 05:55:18.440 align:start position:0%
sununu center it's on some of the most
 
05:55:21.708 --> 05:55:21.718 align:start position:0%
important valuable property I think in
 
05:55:23.448 --> 05:55:23.458 align:start position:0%
the state due to its proximity to
 
05:55:23.458 --> 05:55:24.430 align:start position:0%
the state due to its proximity to
commercial

05:55:24.430 --> 05:55:24.440 align:start position:0%
commercial
 
05:55:28.208 --> 05:55:28.218 align:start position:0%
life and routes of access
 
05:55:31.548 --> 05:55:31.558 align:start position:0%
and so so we're encouraging that they
 
05:55:34.670 --> 05:55:34.680 align:start position:0%
look at the next use to improve the tax
 
05:55:37.190 --> 05:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
and business rules of the City in the
 
05:55:37.200 --> 05:55:40.490 align:start position:0%
and business rules of the City in the
state

05:55:40.490 --> 05:55:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:43.190 --> 05:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
there's an appropriation of 15 million
 
05:55:48.070 --> 05:55:48.080 align:start position:0%
dollars to begin all of this analysis
 
05:55:52.970 --> 05:55:52.980 align:start position:0%
we direct that the governor shall look
 
05:55:56.270 --> 05:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
at some discretionary funds like in the
 
05:55:58.850 --> 05:55:58.860 align:start position:0%
American Rescue plan act to see if they
 
05:56:02.270 --> 05:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
can be allocated to put a dent in that
 
05:56:05.030 --> 05:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
15 million dollars to reduce the burden
 
05:56:10.788 --> 05:56:10.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:15.110 --> 05:56:15.120 align:start position:0%
so so that's kind of a walk through uh
 
05:56:18.170 --> 05:56:18.180 align:start position:0%
the amendment to HB 120
 
05:56:22.910 --> 05:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
0084 hotel with a couple of of of rubs
 
05:56:27.410 --> 05:56:27.420 align:start position:0%
that um probably need to be fixed uh and
 
05:56:29.510 --> 05:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
an amendment to the amendment but I'm
 
05:56:32.628 --> 05:56:32.638 align:start position:0%
I'm not here to to advocate for those
 
05:56:34.368 --> 05:56:34.378 align:start position:0%
yet because I don't have a house
 
05:56:35.930 --> 05:56:35.940 align:start position:0%
amendment to share with you at this
 
05:56:38.510 --> 05:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
point just concerns that are on the
 
05:56:38.520 --> 05:56:39.410 align:start position:0%
point just concerns that are on the
radar

05:56:39.410 --> 05:56:39.420 align:start position:0%
radar
 
05:56:43.430 --> 05:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
so you know in summary I really need you
 
05:56:46.250 --> 05:56:46.260 align:start position:0%
we need you the kids need you a
 
05:56:48.410 --> 05:56:48.420 align:start position:0%
community needs you we got to get this
 
05:56:52.010 --> 05:56:52.020 align:start position:0%
passed so that we don't end up with a
 
05:56:55.970 --> 05:56:55.980 align:start position:0%
forced closure on one March so and it's
 
05:56:58.910 --> 05:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
important that anything that we disagree
 
05:57:02.750 --> 05:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
with on this we look to really align
 
05:57:05.150 --> 05:57:05.160 align:start position:0%
closely with the Senate so that we can
 
05:57:08.628 --> 05:57:08.638 align:start position:0%
get this bill passed expeditiously and I
 
05:57:10.730 --> 05:57:10.740 align:start position:0%
swear I'll keep a list of things that
 
05:57:12.948 --> 05:57:12.958 align:start position:0%
you think are issues so that we can
 
05:57:16.628 --> 05:57:16.638 align:start position:0%
introduce it in a new bill January of 24
 
05:57:20.570 --> 05:57:20.580 align:start position:0%
if needed so so with that I'm I'm
 
05:57:22.970 --> 05:57:22.980 align:start position:0%
willing to take questions Mr chair
 
05:57:25.670 --> 05:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative you have done a
 
05:57:28.490 --> 05:57:28.500 align:start position:0%
lot of work on this and you have done
 
05:57:31.850 --> 05:57:31.860 align:start position:0%
Henry Kissinger level shuttle diplomacy
 
05:57:34.490 --> 05:57:34.500 align:start position:0%
with the Senate how's that huh
 
05:57:37.330 --> 05:57:37.340 align:start position:0%
um and I don't have his accent
 
05:57:41.868 --> 05:57:41.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:43.190 --> 05:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
um we will
 
05:57:46.310 --> 05:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
keep a slot open on Tuesday afternoons
 
05:57:48.530 --> 05:57:48.540 align:start position:0%
in this committee
 
05:57:51.350 --> 05:57:51.360 align:start position:0%
so that if you have something to bring
 
05:57:54.048 --> 05:57:54.058 align:start position:0%
to us especially in light of what the
 
05:57:56.510 --> 05:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
Senate is passing will be able to be
 
05:58:00.708 --> 05:58:00.718 align:start position:0%
ready right away to exec what comes to
 
05:58:03.170 --> 05:58:03.180 align:start position:0%
us yes yes sir I appreciate that and
 
05:58:05.448 --> 05:58:05.458 align:start position:0%
just to give you a foreshadow a little
 
05:58:08.810 --> 05:58:08.820 align:start position:0%
bit I think the amendment that I have is
 
05:58:11.090 --> 05:58:11.100 align:start position:0%
going to be amended one more time it's
 
05:58:13.070 --> 05:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
going to be very much like this with the
 
05:58:16.070 --> 05:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
points that I just verbally mentioned so
 
05:58:17.628 --> 05:58:17.638 align:start position:0%
that there's still just one Amendment
 
05:58:20.330 --> 05:58:20.340 align:start position:0%
overall but it'll really be the one that
 
05:58:23.750 --> 05:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
I advocate for us to pass will that as
 
05:58:25.208 --> 05:58:25.218 align:start position:0%
much as possible
 
05:58:28.190 --> 05:58:28.200 align:start position:0%
mimic what the Senate is doing and the
 
05:58:30.048 --> 05:58:30.058 align:start position:0%
Amendments that they've been working on
 
05:58:32.448 --> 05:58:32.458 align:start position:0%
down to the comma so there will be no
 
05:58:36.350 --> 05:58:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:39.590 --> 05:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
um okay I've never fast tracked a bill
 
05:58:41.810 --> 05:58:41.820 align:start position:0%
neither have I I don't mind making it up
 
05:58:44.750 --> 05:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
too I don't know how that works I I sort
 
05:58:47.390 --> 05:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
of feel like I'm uh running a relay race
 
05:58:49.670 --> 05:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
and I'm just running as fast as I can
 
05:58:51.410 --> 05:58:51.420 align:start position:0%
grabbing the Baton and getting ready to
 
05:58:53.208 --> 05:58:53.218 align:start position:0%
hand it to the next one I have no idea
 
05:58:55.250 --> 05:58:55.260 align:start position:0%
how this race ends
 
05:58:58.190 --> 05:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
that's why we get the big bucks yeah
 
05:59:01.150 --> 05:59:01.160 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative Edwards
 
05:59:05.510 --> 05:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:07.368 --> 05:59:07.378 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:59:08.708 --> 05:59:08.718 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:59:12.410 --> 05:59:12.420 align:start position:0%
in reading the amendment in the Bill
 
05:59:15.470 --> 05:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
um I didn't see anywhere that the state
 
05:59:17.570 --> 05:59:17.580 align:start position:0%
would Implement a system
 
05:59:20.030 --> 05:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
that any surrounding communities
 
05:59:25.190 --> 05:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
wherever the facility is is placed
 
05:59:28.010 --> 05:59:28.020 align:start position:0%
um their support please fire whatever
 
05:59:31.368 --> 05:59:31.378 align:start position:0%
would be reimbursed at all is that in
 
05:59:34.070 --> 05:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
the bill am I missing it
 
05:59:36.288 --> 05:59:36.298 align:start position:0%
it's in the amendment that you've not
 
05:59:39.530 --> 05:59:39.540 align:start position:0%
seen yet it's it's it's absolutely
 
05:59:43.190 --> 05:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
agreed that uh the amendment I just
 
05:59:46.070 --> 05:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
introduced to you is is missing a key
 
05:59:46.080 --> 05:59:49.490 align:start position:0%
introduced to you is is missing a key
component

05:59:49.490 --> 05:59:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:57.110 --> 05:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:00.288 --> 06:00:00.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:05.750 --> 06:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
oh okay so uh so uh thank you and I'll
 
06:00:08.448 --> 06:00:08.458 align:start position:0%
I'll integrate your um your correction
 
06:00:11.930 --> 06:00:11.940 align:start position:0%
and your teaching point but um but there
 
06:00:14.510 --> 06:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
there there will be a commission that
 
06:00:16.368 --> 06:00:16.378 align:start position:0%
will work with
 
06:00:18.470 --> 06:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
um like the municipal governing board
 
06:00:21.310 --> 06:00:21.320 align:start position:0%
local law enforcement the sheriff's
 
06:00:24.110 --> 06:00:24.120 align:start position:0%
Association the child advocate the
 
06:00:27.230 --> 06:00:27.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner Department of Safety and uh
 
06:00:30.128 --> 06:00:30.138 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's it's it's my belief in in
 
06:00:33.770 --> 06:00:33.780 align:start position:0%
Mr ribson points out that on lines 22 to
 
06:00:36.530 --> 06:00:36.540 align:start position:0%
I think 25 or so
 
06:00:38.930 --> 06:00:38.940 align:start position:0%
um it says that the department shall to
 
06:00:41.810 --> 06:00:41.820 align:start position:0%
the extent practical uh Implement any
 
06:00:43.850 --> 06:00:43.860 align:start position:0%
reasonable requests by the communities I
 
06:00:45.708 --> 06:00:45.718 align:start position:0%
I did highlight that in my uh
 
06:00:47.930 --> 06:00:47.940 align:start position:0%
introduction to ensure safe operations
 
06:00:50.090 --> 06:00:50.100 align:start position:0%
Implement a payment okay there you go
 
06:00:51.890 --> 06:00:51.900 align:start position:0%
that's the money line you're looking for
 
06:00:55.970 --> 06:00:55.980 align:start position:0%
line 24. uh Implement a payment in lieu
 
06:00:58.368 --> 06:00:58.378 align:start position:0%
of taxes arrangement to prevent the
 
06:01:00.708 --> 06:01:00.718 align:start position:0%
shifting across the local taxpayer years
 
06:01:02.868 --> 06:01:02.878 align:start position:0%
and to ensure the cooperation of the
 
06:01:05.330 --> 06:01:05.340 align:start position:0%
prospective community so that so that's
 
06:01:08.270 --> 06:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
our strategic Direction the commission
 
06:01:11.330 --> 06:01:11.340 align:start position:0%
is going to be the required vehicle to
 
06:01:13.610 --> 06:01:13.620 align:start position:0%
get us there representative I might
 
06:01:16.070 --> 06:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
suggest in terms of that that you look
 
06:01:19.190 --> 06:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
at the changing of the word Community to
 
06:01:22.970 --> 06:01:22.980 align:start position:0%
communities just for the sake of
 
06:01:25.128 --> 06:01:25.138 align:start position:0%
argument let's suppose this is cited in
 
06:01:28.490 --> 06:01:28.500 align:start position:0%
Hampstead we already know with the use
 
06:01:31.010 --> 06:01:31.020 align:start position:0%
of Hampstead Hospital there's memoranda
 
06:01:33.590 --> 06:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
of understanding between the state and
 
06:01:36.170 --> 06:01:36.180 align:start position:0%
the town and so on and one would assume
 
06:01:38.208 --> 06:01:38.218 align:start position:0%
the same would happen no matter where
 
06:01:41.150 --> 06:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
this facility is cited but should this
 
06:01:43.850 --> 06:01:43.860 align:start position:0%
be cited in Hampstead there would need
 
06:01:45.708 --> 06:01:45.718 align:start position:0%
to be an arrangement to your point
 
06:01:48.830 --> 06:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
representative for Mutual aid for from
 
06:01:52.250 --> 06:01:52.260 align:start position:0%
police and fire for towns a budding
 
06:01:55.490 --> 06:01:55.500 align:start position:0%
Hampstead so I might suggest that that
 
06:01:58.070 --> 06:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
be changed from Community to communities
 
06:02:00.170 --> 06:02:00.180 align:start position:0%
so you know what they say great minds
 
06:02:03.110 --> 06:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
think alike I I didn't consider that at
 
06:02:06.770 --> 06:02:06.780 align:start position:0%
all but Senator Abbas did and and so
 
06:02:09.048 --> 06:02:09.058 align:start position:0%
somewhere he's mentioned that we should
 
06:02:11.570 --> 06:02:11.580 align:start position:0%
be talking about uh and and in one of
 
06:02:14.270 --> 06:02:14.280 align:start position:0%
these versions We had the phrase
 
06:02:17.810 --> 06:02:17.820 align:start position:0%
um adjacent or contiguous communities
 
06:02:19.970 --> 06:02:19.980 align:start position:0%
whichever you can spell is fine with me
 
06:02:23.930 --> 06:02:23.940 align:start position:0%
and and I you know with uh Mr Liam uh
 
06:02:25.730 --> 06:02:25.740 align:start position:0%
helping I can probably spell them all
 
06:02:25.740 --> 06:02:26.868 align:start position:0%
helping I can probably spell them all
but

06:02:26.868 --> 06:02:26.878 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:02:28.970 --> 06:02:28.980 align:start position:0%
um but the uh
 
06:02:30.890 --> 06:02:30.900 align:start position:0%
but I have to go back through here I'm
 
06:02:32.810 --> 06:02:32.820 align:start position:0%
juggling like four different documents
 
06:02:34.250 --> 06:02:34.260 align:start position:0%
and I don't I don't know where it is
 
06:02:36.610 --> 06:02:36.620 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a good point
 
06:02:39.770 --> 06:02:39.780 align:start position:0%
representative McMahon but thank you for
 
06:02:41.150 --> 06:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
your work on this
 
06:02:43.670 --> 06:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
um by the way as well uh relative to
 
06:02:45.830 --> 06:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
your comments earlier of the previous
 
06:02:48.530 --> 06:02:48.540 align:start position:0%
conference committee that begat no
 
06:02:52.250 --> 06:02:52.260 align:start position:0%
decision does do the Amendments and the
 
06:02:54.590 --> 06:02:54.600 align:start position:0%
ones come and meet the challenges that
 
06:02:56.208 --> 06:02:56.218 align:start position:0%
were expressed during that conference
 
06:02:56.218 --> 06:02:57.708 align:start position:0%
were expressed during that conference
committee

06:02:57.708 --> 06:02:57.718 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:03:00.048 --> 06:03:00.058 align:start position:0%
okay I'm gonna I'm gonna do what may
 
06:03:02.090 --> 06:03:02.100 align:start position:0%
sound like some marketing here
 
06:03:05.750 --> 06:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
the the committee of conference got into
 
06:03:07.850 --> 06:03:07.860 align:start position:0%
the crunch time and there were some
 
06:03:10.970 --> 06:03:10.980 align:start position:0%
opportunities to improve it but because
 
06:03:13.310 --> 06:03:13.320 align:start position:0%
the clock was running a lot of the
 
06:03:15.530 --> 06:03:15.540 align:start position:0%
improvements didn't really make it in
 
06:03:18.110 --> 06:03:18.120 align:start position:0%
the committee conference failed around
 
06:03:21.048 --> 06:03:21.058 align:start position:0%
the capacity issue primarily that was
 
06:03:22.850 --> 06:03:22.860 align:start position:0%
that was the big elephant that that
 
06:03:25.010 --> 06:03:25.020 align:start position:0%
crushed the boat but
 
06:03:28.010 --> 06:03:28.020 align:start position:0%
um but what we have done
 
06:03:32.208 --> 06:03:32.218 align:start position:0%
is Senator Carson she came up with some
 
06:03:33.590 --> 06:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
improvements to the committee a
 
06:03:35.330 --> 06:03:35.340 align:start position:0%
conference I had come up with some
 
06:03:37.310 --> 06:03:37.320 align:start position:0%
improvements the community econ or
 
06:03:39.350 --> 06:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
committee a conference these things got
 
06:03:42.048 --> 06:03:42.058 align:start position:0%
integrated and the Senate passed their
 
06:03:45.410 --> 06:03:45.420 align:start position:0%
Amendment 22 to 2 to take the committee
 
06:03:47.628 --> 06:03:47.638 align:start position:0%
conference as the Baseline and make it
 
06:03:47.638 --> 06:03:48.548 align:start position:0%
conference as the Baseline and make it
better

06:03:48.548 --> 06:03:48.558 align:start position:0%
better
 
06:03:52.128 --> 06:03:52.138 align:start position:0%
so so I I would use the term new and
 
06:03:52.138 --> 06:03:53.208 align:start position:0%
so so I I would use the term new and
improved

06:03:53.208 --> 06:03:53.218 align:start position:0%
improved
 
06:03:55.490 --> 06:03:55.500 align:start position:0%
I just want to follow on the 22-2 vote
 
06:03:57.170 --> 06:03:57.180 align:start position:0%
is that what just happened this past
 
06:03:57.180 --> 06:03:58.670 align:start position:0%
is that what just happened this past
month

06:03:58.670 --> 06:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
month
 
06:04:00.830 --> 06:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
um I think it was just last week I'm
 
06:04:03.410 --> 06:04:03.420 align:start position:0%
losing track of time but
 
06:04:05.510 --> 06:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
um but this
 
06:04:08.770 --> 06:04:08.780 align:start position:0%
Edward's Amendment uh
 
06:04:12.530 --> 06:04:12.540 align:start position:0%
zero zero eight four is exactly what
 
06:04:15.230 --> 06:04:15.240 align:start position:0%
passed 22-2 got it all right thank you
 
06:04:17.930 --> 06:04:17.940 align:start position:0%
yes sir however it is fair to say that
 
06:04:19.548 --> 06:04:19.558 align:start position:0%
the Senate has made two amendments today
 
06:04:22.128 --> 06:04:22.138 align:start position:0%
yes some finance and that will work its
 
06:04:24.170 --> 06:04:24.180 align:start position:0%
way into what you may present to us next
 
06:04:26.208 --> 06:04:26.218 align:start position:0%
week right I have one more Amendment to
 
06:04:27.350 --> 06:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
06:04:31.368 --> 06:04:31.378 align:start position:0%
wonderful representative long
 
06:04:33.048 --> 06:04:33.058 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
06:04:34.788 --> 06:04:34.798 align:start position:0%
representative for your due diligence I
 
06:04:37.190 --> 06:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
I know the headache that this has
 
06:04:39.890 --> 06:04:39.900 align:start position:0%
created and I you did a great job
 
06:04:42.590 --> 06:04:42.600 align:start position:0%
um my my only concern is you had
 
06:04:48.430 --> 06:04:48.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:50.750 --> 06:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
I have to see it
 
06:04:55.128 --> 06:04:55.138 align:start position:0%
okay first page 25 and 26. right yes sir
 
06:04:55.138 --> 06:04:57.288 align:start position:0%
okay first page 25 and 26. right yes sir
I

06:04:57.288 --> 06:04:57.298 align:start position:0%
I
 
06:04:59.510 --> 06:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
I'm unfamiliar with administered I'd
 
06:05:03.288 --> 06:05:03.298 align:start position:0%
like to see operated owned and operated
 
06:05:07.788 --> 06:05:07.798 align:start position:0%
and administered by DHHS I I you know
 
06:05:10.730 --> 06:05:10.740 align:start position:0%
can can can I tell you that that would
 
06:05:14.750 --> 06:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
be a great thing to put into like a
 
06:05:18.650 --> 06:05:18.660 align:start position:0%
January 24 bill I I and and the reason I
 
06:05:21.910 --> 06:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
think I'm okay with this is that our
 
06:05:26.208 --> 06:05:26.218 align:start position:0%
legislative intent is that this is going
 
06:05:28.850 --> 06:05:28.860 align:start position:0%
to be on State Property built with State
 
06:05:31.430 --> 06:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
money administered by the department
 
06:05:33.708 --> 06:05:33.718 align:start position:0%
with the Department encouraged to look
 
06:05:37.010 --> 06:05:37.020 align:start position:0%
for sharing and virtual Services I I
 
06:05:39.110 --> 06:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
don't I don't think there's any doubt
 
06:05:41.810 --> 06:05:41.820 align:start position:0%
that the intent is
 
06:05:44.750 --> 06:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
um to to to go ahead and have the
 
06:05:47.208 --> 06:05:47.218 align:start position:0%
control exercised by the department and
 
06:05:48.890 --> 06:05:48.900 align:start position:0%
I I think that's what your concern is
 
06:05:51.110 --> 06:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
does the word administrated versus
 
06:05:54.350 --> 06:05:54.360 align:start position:0%
operated or the use of them both uh
 
06:05:58.610 --> 06:05:58.620 align:start position:0%
connote that control better I you know
 
06:06:02.570 --> 06:06:02.580 align:start position:0%
I'm not an English major so so I in the
 
06:06:06.048 --> 06:06:06.058 align:start position:0%
in the discussions we agreed that
 
06:06:08.350 --> 06:06:08.360 align:start position:0%
administered was sort of a more
 
06:06:11.330 --> 06:06:11.340 align:start position:0%
enveloping term than operated that
 
06:06:15.048 --> 06:06:15.058 align:start position:0%
operated feels more like a day-to-day
 
06:06:18.530 --> 06:06:18.540 align:start position:0%
operations a more you know you know more
 
06:06:21.170 --> 06:06:21.180 align:start position:0%
employees fewer shared services for
 
06:06:25.368 --> 06:06:25.378 align:start position:0%
fewer shared contracts so so so we we
 
06:06:28.610 --> 06:06:28.620 align:start position:0%
chose administered uh intentionally
 
06:06:28.620 --> 06:06:30.110 align:start position:0%
chose administered uh intentionally
now

06:06:30.110 --> 06:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
now
 
06:06:34.970 --> 06:06:34.980 align:start position:0%
I I'm reluctant to take on changes that
 
06:06:37.970 --> 06:06:37.980 align:start position:0%
the Senate isn't in sync with for fear
 
06:06:41.570 --> 06:06:41.580 align:start position:0%
that if it's not comma for period for
 
06:06:44.150 --> 06:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
word uh we have a problem with getting
 
06:06:47.208 --> 06:06:47.218 align:start position:0%
this passed fast and so what I would
 
06:06:49.368 --> 06:06:49.378 align:start position:0%
have what I'd like to ask you Mr Vice
 
06:06:53.030 --> 06:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
chair is the addition of the word and
 
06:06:55.070 --> 06:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
operated that term
 
06:06:56.948 --> 06:06:56.958 align:start position:0%
is that
 
06:07:00.368 --> 06:07:00.378 align:start position:0%
significant enough to you to wear
 
06:07:02.690 --> 06:07:02.700 align:start position:0%
it has to be there before you can
 
06:07:06.170 --> 06:07:06.180 align:start position:0%
support this bill can it wait until sort
 
06:07:11.570 --> 06:07:11.580 align:start position:0%
of a cleanup Bill January of 24.
 
06:07:13.730 --> 06:07:13.740 align:start position:0%
find the answer thank you
 
06:07:17.090 --> 06:07:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:19.670 --> 06:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
I mean as far as supporting this I I get
 
06:07:23.750 --> 06:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
it that this is an emergency and it
 
06:07:25.128 --> 06:07:25.138 align:start position:0%
needs to be done
 
06:07:29.208 --> 06:07:29.218 align:start position:0%
uh however I would prefer to know that
 
06:07:32.990 --> 06:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
it'll be operated by DHHS could you help
 
06:07:34.850 --> 06:07:34.860 align:start position:0%
me understand the word operated does
 
06:07:37.030 --> 06:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
that mean a hundred percent
 
06:07:40.128 --> 06:07:40.138 align:start position:0%
oh okay I cannot all right I was hoping
 
06:07:41.570 --> 06:07:41.580 align:start position:0%
to build something with you that would
 
06:07:45.170 --> 06:07:45.180 align:start position:0%
stand the test of time but uh but but my
 
06:07:47.510 --> 06:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
eye and work of mine says operated means
 
06:07:47.520 --> 06:07:49.250 align:start position:0%
eye and work of mine says operated means
operated

06:07:49.250 --> 06:07:49.260 align:start position:0%
operated
 
06:07:51.350 --> 06:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
administered I don't know where that
 
06:07:55.850 --> 06:07:55.860 align:start position:0%
gray is yeah so I would prefer I
 
06:07:59.208 --> 06:07:59.218 align:start position:0%
will I vote for this I
 
06:08:01.670 --> 06:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
I still have small yeah testimony I need
 
06:08:03.170 --> 06:08:03.180 align:start position:0%
to hear yeah right right
 
06:08:04.970 --> 06:08:04.980 align:start position:0%
um however I
 
06:08:06.770 --> 06:08:06.780 align:start position:0%
I would be comfortable with operated
 
06:08:08.628 --> 06:08:08.638 align:start position:0%
that tells me that it's going to be
 
06:08:11.690 --> 06:08:11.700 align:start position:0%
operated by does the word operator do
 
06:08:15.590 --> 06:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
you mean that there can't be contracting
 
06:08:19.010 --> 06:08:19.020 align:start position:0%
of subordinate parts of the operation to
 
06:08:22.190 --> 06:08:22.200 align:start position:0%
private entities oh they can be they can
 
06:08:25.010 --> 06:08:25.020 align:start position:0%
be yeah okay so yeah so conceptually we
 
06:08:26.628 --> 06:08:26.638 align:start position:0%
agree it's just it's just getting the
 
06:08:29.390 --> 06:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
words right right uh you know like the
 
06:08:31.570 --> 06:08:31.580 align:start position:0%
facility shall not be administered by an
 
06:08:33.830 --> 06:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
non-governmental entity yeah that's what
 
06:08:38.150 --> 06:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
so I mean does that mean that a barber I
 
06:08:40.250 --> 06:08:40.260 align:start position:0%
can't hire a barber to come in and cut
 
06:08:42.770 --> 06:08:42.780 align:start position:0%
people's hair yeah so so I'll tell you
 
06:08:44.270 --> 06:08:44.280 align:start position:0%
what I'll I'll
 
06:08:46.128 --> 06:08:46.138 align:start position:0%
because we have such a long history and
 
06:08:49.190 --> 06:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
I I trust your judgment I I will try to
 
06:08:51.110 --> 06:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
find a spot to work that in with the
 
06:08:53.570 --> 06:08:53.580 align:start position:0%
Senate and then the chairman has said he
 
06:08:57.110 --> 06:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
prefers communities plural instead of
 
06:08:58.310 --> 06:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
communities well that's what my friends
 
06:08:59.930 --> 06:08:59.940 align:start position:0%
in Atkinson
 
06:08:59.940 --> 06:09:01.570 align:start position:0%
in Atkinson
um

06:09:01.570 --> 06:09:01.580 align:start position:0%

06:09:04.490 --> 06:09:04.500 align:start position:0%

and check me when I come back with the
 
06:09:15.048 --> 06:09:15.058 align:start position:0%
amendment to the amendment any further
 
06:09:17.390 --> 06:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
questions for the representative however
 
06:09:20.448 --> 06:09:20.458 align:start position:0%
abstruse they may be
 
06:09:27.590 --> 06:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:31.010 --> 06:09:31.020 align:start position:0%
you were selected here for a reason sir
 
06:09:32.570 --> 06:09:32.580 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
06:09:33.948 --> 06:09:33.958 align:start position:0%
over here
 
06:09:38.448 --> 06:09:38.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:41.150 --> 06:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Edwards
 
06:09:41.160 --> 06:09:42.410 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Edwards
um

06:09:42.410 --> 06:09:42.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:09:44.208 --> 06:09:44.218 align:start position:0%
I have a series of things to do I'm
 
06:09:45.650 --> 06:09:45.660 align:start position:0%
wondering about because I haven't been
 
06:09:47.750 --> 06:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
here for a little while I was here when
 
06:09:50.690 --> 06:09:50.700 align:start position:0%
we created the synonym Center I went to
 
06:09:53.090 --> 06:09:53.100 align:start position:0%
the inauguration office we were looking
 
06:09:54.970 --> 06:09:54.980 align:start position:0%
for someone to blame
 
06:09:57.830 --> 06:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
well I I and I'm glad you said that
 
06:09:59.270 --> 06:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
because I don't know what's wrong it was
 
06:10:01.190 --> 06:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
state of the art building we even named
 
06:10:03.048 --> 06:10:03.058 align:start position:0%
a portion of it after Lionel Johnson who
 
06:10:06.830 --> 06:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
totally totally a joke sorry oh Dad
 
06:10:06.840 --> 06:10:08.330 align:start position:0%
totally totally a joke sorry oh Dad
okay

06:10:08.330 --> 06:10:08.340 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:10:10.310 --> 06:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
um so I'm I'm gonna watch what's so bad
 
06:10:12.470 --> 06:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
about it except 13 million dollars to
 
06:10:14.448 --> 06:10:14.458 align:start position:0%
run it yeah I thought it was a beautiful
 
06:10:17.330 --> 06:10:17.340 align:start position:0%
building it's it's more than that uh oh
 
06:10:19.250 --> 06:10:19.260 align:start position:0%
are you have you answered it well asked
 
06:10:20.868 --> 06:10:20.878 align:start position:0%
the question so at some point I'd like
 
06:10:22.548 --> 06:10:22.558 align:start position:0%
you to know what the differential and
 
06:10:24.650 --> 06:10:24.660 align:start position:0%
cost is going to be I didn't see that
 
06:10:26.270 --> 06:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
here you said 13 million dollars so
 
06:10:28.190 --> 06:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
therefore we need to do something then
 
06:10:29.390 --> 06:10:29.400 align:start position:0%
that's the only thing I've heard so far
 
06:10:31.430 --> 06:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
that says we got to get into a different
 
06:10:33.170 --> 06:10:33.180 align:start position:0%
building because this one costs too much
 
06:10:34.970 --> 06:10:34.980 align:start position:0%
to operate which I expect most of the
 
06:10:39.470 --> 06:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
operational costs were uh uh people
 
06:10:41.750 --> 06:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
people that run the place because the
 
06:10:43.670 --> 06:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
facility we got most of the money from
 
06:10:44.810 --> 06:10:44.820 align:start position:0%
the federal government that's why it's
 
06:10:47.030 --> 06:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
called the sununusa right because sununu
 
06:10:50.810 --> 06:10:50.820 align:start position:0%
was able to procure the funds uh forest
 
06:10:54.230 --> 06:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
for that building and I I wonder if that
 
06:10:56.690 --> 06:10:56.700 align:start position:0%
uh building could be used for uh mental
 
06:10:59.270 --> 06:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
health or uh homeless problems that we
 
06:10:59.280 --> 06:11:00.650 align:start position:0%
health or uh homeless problems that we
have

06:11:00.650 --> 06:11:00.660 align:start position:0%
have
 
06:11:03.948 --> 06:11:03.958 align:start position:0%
um I guess we don't need as much we used
 
06:11:05.690 --> 06:11:05.700 align:start position:0%
to use the king cottages
 
06:11:07.850 --> 06:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
uh prior to the student who said and the
 
06:11:09.170 --> 06:11:09.180 align:start position:0%
Court ruled that we had to do something
 
06:11:10.490 --> 06:11:10.500 align:start position:0%
different and that's why we went into
 
06:11:13.548 --> 06:11:13.558 align:start position:0%
the shinuno center
 
06:11:13.558 --> 06:11:14.510 align:start position:0%
the shinuno center
um

06:11:14.510 --> 06:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:11:16.250 --> 06:11:16.260 align:start position:0%
and a lot of people thought that that
 
06:11:18.048 --> 06:11:18.058 align:start position:0%
wasn't going to be big enough
 
06:11:21.708 --> 06:11:21.718 align:start position:0%
uh but apparently it's too big now
 
06:11:21.718 --> 06:11:23.448 align:start position:0%
uh but apparently it's too big now
so

06:11:23.448 --> 06:11:23.458 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:11:23.458 --> 06:11:24.288 align:start position:0%
so
um

06:11:24.288 --> 06:11:24.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:11:26.990 --> 06:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
and I if this
 
06:11:29.750 --> 06:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
emergency so far all I can understand is
 
06:11:32.690 --> 06:11:32.700 align:start position:0%
because we have a date to sell it
 
06:11:35.570 --> 06:11:35.580 align:start position:0%
and that if it's just a date to get rid
 
06:11:38.090 --> 06:11:38.100 align:start position:0%
of it we can that's an easy Bill to push
 
06:11:40.310 --> 06:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
that through without worrying about
 
06:11:41.628 --> 06:11:41.638 align:start position:0%
getting the new one bill we can come
 
06:11:43.070 --> 06:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
back and do that
 
06:11:45.830 --> 06:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
so if any of that you can help me with
 
06:11:48.410 --> 06:11:48.420 align:start position:0%
to understand I I'd say it's the
 
06:11:51.110 --> 06:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
opposite the you know the problem isn't
 
06:11:53.448 --> 06:11:53.458 align:start position:0%
disposing of the building this this this
 
06:11:57.650 --> 06:11:57.660 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't say how it will uh how it
 
06:11:59.810 --> 06:11:59.820 align:start position:0%
will be used in the future just simply
 
06:12:01.910 --> 06:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
says we'll turn it over to das and
 
06:12:03.948 --> 06:12:03.958 align:start position:0%
they'll figure it out once we're done
 
06:12:06.410 --> 06:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
with it but we're not done with it until
 
06:12:10.128 --> 06:12:10.138 align:start position:0%
we can move the kids into an appropriate
 
06:12:13.850 --> 06:12:13.860 align:start position:0%
setting and so so you know just to put
 
06:12:16.730 --> 06:12:16.740 align:start position:0%
it in a you know the financial terms you
 
06:12:19.490 --> 06:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
got to look at it from an efficiency and
 
06:12:21.650 --> 06:12:21.660 align:start position:0%
an Effectiveness perspective we're
 
06:12:24.048 --> 06:12:24.058 align:start position:0%
looking to gain efficiency by
 
06:12:26.090 --> 06:12:26.100 align:start position:0%
consolidating the amount of space that
 
06:12:28.670 --> 06:12:28.680 align:start position:0%
needs to be controlled and supervised
 
06:12:31.190 --> 06:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
and cleaned and heated and all of that
 
06:12:33.470 --> 06:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
and and and get an appropriate size
 
06:12:37.190 --> 06:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
staff a staff built for 12 instead of a
 
06:12:38.570 --> 06:12:38.580 align:start position:0%
much larger number so we're trying to
 
06:12:42.170 --> 06:12:42.180 align:start position:0%
gain efficiency but but that that takes
 
06:12:43.970 --> 06:12:43.980 align:start position:0%
our eye off the other ball and the other
 
06:12:46.010 --> 06:12:46.020 align:start position:0%
ball is the effectiveness what we've
 
06:12:49.690 --> 06:12:49.700 align:start position:0%
determined is that sort of the the hard
 
06:12:54.048 --> 06:12:54.058 align:start position:0%
wall concrete cinder block prison feel
 
06:12:57.708 --> 06:12:57.718 align:start position:0%
of the sununu center is not appropriate
 
06:12:59.530 --> 06:12:59.540 align:start position:0%
to the kind of
 
06:13:02.530 --> 06:13:02.540 align:start position:0%
therapy-centric care that we want to
 
06:13:07.208 --> 06:13:07.218 align:start position:0%
provide to these kids so so the the the
 
06:13:10.010 --> 06:13:10.020 align:start position:0%
environmental setting will become much
 
06:13:12.410 --> 06:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
more home-like and I think I pointed out
 
06:13:15.170 --> 06:13:15.180 align:start position:0%
that that particular paragraph where we
 
06:13:16.810 --> 06:13:16.820 align:start position:0%
talked about that
 
06:13:19.750 --> 06:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
it's uh on page two
 
06:13:24.110 --> 06:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
line 12 and it just kind of goes a
 
06:13:26.930 --> 06:13:26.940 align:start position:0%
physical design including a home-like
 
06:13:29.330 --> 06:13:29.340 align:start position:0%
interior and exterior to the maximum
 
06:13:32.270 --> 06:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
extent practical what we're building is
 
06:13:35.208 --> 06:13:35.218 align:start position:0%
is more like a treatment center and less
 
06:13:37.670 --> 06:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
like a prison and that and and that's
 
06:13:40.250 --> 06:13:40.260 align:start position:0%
what sununu is now it's a facility
 
06:13:43.670 --> 06:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate to prison it's a prison that
 
06:13:47.930 --> 06:13:47.940 align:start position:0%
can hold up to 144. I I don't know how
 
06:13:50.930 --> 06:13:50.940 align:start position:0%
we ever thought we would keep 144 kids
 
06:13:53.810 --> 06:13:53.820 align:start position:0%
in there you know I I wasn't here then
 
06:13:55.850 --> 06:13:55.860 align:start position:0%
um but as I've seen the census provided
 
06:13:57.190 --> 06:13:57.200 align:start position:0%
by the department
 
06:13:59.810 --> 06:13:59.820 align:start position:0%
it wasn't all that long ago eight years
 
06:14:02.628 --> 06:14:02.638 align:start position:0%
maybe where we were having a census like
 
06:14:05.990 --> 06:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
80 or something and and that that has
 
06:14:08.150 --> 06:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
trailed off in the last two three years
 
06:14:12.110 --> 06:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
to where the range of of 12 to 14 seems
 
06:14:15.230 --> 06:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
to be the steady state so
 
06:14:15.240 --> 06:14:16.610 align:start position:0%
to be the steady state so
um

06:14:16.610 --> 06:14:16.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:14:19.670 --> 06:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
so we're building a facility more
 
06:14:22.430 --> 06:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
suitable we're building a facility where
 
06:14:24.170 --> 06:14:24.180 align:start position:0%
we can co-locate it with a similar
 
06:14:27.350 --> 06:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
facility to leverage capabilities uh
 
06:14:29.810 --> 06:14:29.820 align:start position:0%
gain some efficiency and some expertise
 
06:14:32.448 --> 06:14:32.458 align:start position:0%
and and Child Development Behavioral
 
06:14:35.150 --> 06:14:35.160 align:start position:0%
Health so
 
06:14:37.548 --> 06:14:37.558 align:start position:0%
um the what I what I meant to
 
06:14:39.708 --> 06:14:39.718 align:start position:0%
communicate when I talked about the 13
 
06:14:43.570 --> 06:14:43.580 align:start position:0%
million dollar a year Bill Bill
 
06:14:48.948 --> 06:14:48.958 align:start position:0%
it cost uh is that over the years more
 
06:14:50.930 --> 06:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
senior members of the finance committee
 
06:14:52.788 --> 06:14:52.798 align:start position:0%
than I am and this is only my second
 
06:14:56.110 --> 06:14:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:00.650 --> 06:15:00.660 align:start position:0%
grew very frustrated that they weren't
 
06:15:02.868 --> 06:15:02.878 align:start position:0%
getting from the Department what they
 
06:15:06.890 --> 06:15:06.900 align:start position:0%
thought they needed in terms of a cost
 
06:15:10.128 --> 06:15:10.138 align:start position:0%
reduction plan and and so
 
06:15:13.070 --> 06:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
there was this pent-up
 
06:15:16.788 --> 06:15:16.798 align:start position:0%
urgency to basically force the issue
 
06:15:18.770 --> 06:15:18.780 align:start position:0%
to be fair if you went over to the
 
06:15:20.810 --> 06:15:20.820 align:start position:0%
department and you asked them they go
 
06:15:22.730 --> 06:15:22.740 align:start position:0%
well legislature never told us to do
 
06:15:24.830 --> 06:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
that or where's the bill where's the
 
06:15:27.890 --> 06:15:27.900 align:start position:0%
where's the you know HP to that made us
 
06:15:31.610 --> 06:15:31.620 align:start position:0%
go do that and and so I I don't know I
 
06:15:34.670 --> 06:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
wasn't here I it sounds in retrospect
 
06:15:37.070 --> 06:15:37.080 align:start position:0%
like you know entities talking past each
 
06:15:41.330 --> 06:15:41.340 align:start position:0%
other and and now the department the two
 
06:15:43.250 --> 06:15:43.260 align:start position:0%
houses of the legislature I haven't
 
06:15:45.350 --> 06:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned the governor's office they're
 
06:15:48.650 --> 06:15:48.660 align:start position:0%
they're all I think in sync on what the
 
06:15:48.660 --> 06:15:49.430 align:start position:0%
they're all I think in sync on what the
replacement

06:15:49.430 --> 06:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
replacement
 
06:15:50.810 --> 06:15:50.820 align:start position:0%
ought to look like and we can't close
 
06:15:52.910 --> 06:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
what we have until we can replace what
 
06:15:55.490 --> 06:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
we have and so this bill is about the
 
06:15:58.128 --> 06:15:58.138 align:start position:0%
replacement so it's a long answer is it
 
06:16:00.410 --> 06:16:00.420 align:start position:0%
is it on point
 
06:16:02.510 --> 06:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
do you wish a follow-up representative
 
06:16:04.390 --> 06:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
Bickford no not this time thank you okay
 
06:16:07.208 --> 06:16:07.218 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
06:16:10.250 --> 06:16:10.260 align:start position:0%
representative Levesque
 
06:16:11.930 --> 06:16:11.940 align:start position:0%
I don't know if
 
06:16:14.090 --> 06:16:14.100 align:start position:0%
the uh Mr chairman thank you for taking
 
06:16:15.530 --> 06:16:15.540 align:start position:0%
my question I don't know if you can
 
06:16:17.208 --> 06:16:17.218 align:start position:0%
answer this or is someone else that's
 
06:16:18.410 --> 06:16:18.420 align:start position:0%
going to speak
 
06:16:18.420 --> 06:16:18.948 align:start position:0%
going to speak
um

06:16:18.948 --> 06:16:18.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:23.510 --> 06:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
when discussing the uh de-escalation
 
06:16:26.270 --> 06:16:26.280 align:start position:0%
techniques uh what exactly would those
 
06:16:26.280 --> 06:16:27.530 align:start position:0%
techniques uh what exactly would those
entail

06:16:27.530 --> 06:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
entail
 
06:16:30.530 --> 06:16:30.540 align:start position:0%
uh because as we know like dealing with
 
06:16:33.110 --> 06:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
children it's hard to
 
06:16:36.530 --> 06:16:36.540 align:start position:0%
cross that line between uh making sure
 
06:16:39.890 --> 06:16:39.900 align:start position:0%
that they are safe for themselves and
 
06:16:43.368 --> 06:16:43.378 align:start position:0%
when I it's like of abuse almost and
 
06:16:45.890 --> 06:16:45.900 align:start position:0%
what those uh de-escalate student
 
06:16:49.128 --> 06:16:49.138 align:start position:0%
techniques look like and what they are I
 
06:16:50.628 --> 06:16:50.638 align:start position:0%
don't know if you could answer that or
 
06:16:53.390 --> 06:16:53.400 align:start position:0%
someone else can so okay so I'll do I'll
 
06:16:55.610 --> 06:16:55.620 align:start position:0%
give you the big picture and then the
 
06:16:59.150 --> 06:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
department can provide uh detail but you
 
06:17:00.650 --> 06:17:00.660 align:start position:0%
know there's sort of in engineering
 
06:17:02.330 --> 06:17:02.340 align:start position:0%
there's this top-down structured
 
06:17:05.270 --> 06:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
approach to to building things and and
 
06:17:07.910 --> 06:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
and we're kind of at a higher level we
 
06:17:11.208 --> 06:17:11.218 align:start position:0%
know that we have to get to the depth in
 
06:17:13.368 --> 06:17:13.378 align:start position:0%
order to answer your question and so
 
06:17:14.810 --> 06:17:14.820 align:start position:0%
what we've done at this higher level
 
06:17:18.368 --> 06:17:18.378 align:start position:0%
which is in this bill is to to include
 
06:17:21.708 --> 06:17:21.718 align:start position:0%
de-escalation as a technique and and we
 
06:17:23.208 --> 06:17:23.218 align:start position:0%
kind of feel ourselves to be a bit
 
06:17:25.910 --> 06:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
enlightened because the whole concept of
 
06:17:28.490 --> 06:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
de-escalation in law enforcement I think
 
06:17:30.948 --> 06:17:30.958 align:start position:0%
is is just more or less of a relatively
 
06:17:33.890 --> 06:17:33.900 align:start position:0%
current topic now now what the details
 
06:17:36.048 --> 06:17:36.058 align:start position:0%
of that are there's going to be an
 
06:17:38.510 --> 06:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity long before the new facility
 
06:17:42.670 --> 06:17:42.680 align:start position:0%
is reopened to to to work that out
 
06:17:46.548 --> 06:17:46.558 align:start position:0%
so I think we also said in here that to
 
06:17:48.650 --> 06:17:48.660 align:start position:0%
the extent that they can begin this new
 
06:17:51.288 --> 06:17:51.298 align:start position:0%
operational model of therapeutic help
 
06:17:53.930 --> 06:17:53.940 align:start position:0%
that they can begin implementing it so I
 
06:17:57.470 --> 06:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
so that T it's the answer to your
 
06:18:01.010 --> 06:18:01.020 align:start position:0%
question is still TBD but it's obviously
 
06:18:03.350 --> 06:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
going to be on our critical path to
 
06:18:03.360 --> 06:18:05.750 align:start position:0%
going to be on our critical path to
opening

06:18:05.750 --> 06:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
opening
 
06:18:08.628 --> 06:18:08.638 align:start position:0%
representative Grossman
 
06:18:10.788 --> 06:18:10.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
06:18:13.368 --> 06:18:13.378 align:start position:0%
representative for coming before us and
 
06:18:16.190 --> 06:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
um my question is related also to those
 
06:18:16.200 --> 06:18:17.750 align:start position:0%
um my question is related also to those
therapeutic

06:18:17.750 --> 06:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
therapeutic
 
06:18:22.368 --> 06:18:22.378 align:start position:0%
has so have the therapeutic changes
 
06:18:24.410 --> 06:18:24.420 align:start position:0%
happened I know we're talking about the
 
06:18:27.590 --> 06:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
structure of the build you know and but
 
06:18:30.890 --> 06:18:30.900 align:start position:0%
at the current sununu Center the
 
06:18:33.788 --> 06:18:33.798 align:start position:0%
movement from incarceration towards
 
06:18:36.470 --> 06:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
community-based therapeutic changes have
 
06:18:37.970 --> 06:18:37.980 align:start position:0%
those begun
 
06:18:41.690 --> 06:18:41.700 align:start position:0%
happening already at the sununu center
 
06:18:47.090 --> 06:18:47.100 align:start position:0%
or are these changes these movements
 
06:18:49.310 --> 06:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
happening once we get a new facility
 
06:18:51.948 --> 06:18:51.958 align:start position:0%
excellent question excellent question I
 
06:18:55.070 --> 06:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
I miss ribson will have the the details
 
06:18:56.510 --> 06:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
of the exact status of the
 
06:18:58.730 --> 06:18:58.740 align:start position:0%
implementation but I but I do understand
 
06:19:01.390 --> 06:19:01.400 align:start position:0%
I think that the context where we're at
 
06:19:05.330 --> 06:19:05.340 align:start position:0%
the the legislature was obligated to get
 
06:19:07.430 --> 06:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
this bill to the governor for passage
 
06:19:11.030 --> 06:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
back in June we didn't do that so if
 
06:19:13.150 --> 06:19:13.160 align:start position:0%
you're an employee at the sununu center
 
06:19:16.250 --> 06:19:16.260 align:start position:0%
what we just did was we unleashed a
 
06:19:18.708 --> 06:19:18.718 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of uncertainty and one
 
06:19:20.810 --> 06:19:20.820 align:start position:0%
of the things you may have tracked is
 
06:19:23.690 --> 06:19:23.700 align:start position:0%
that they've had both attrition problems
 
06:19:26.750 --> 06:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
and and recruiting problems and to the
 
06:19:29.930 --> 06:19:29.940 align:start position:0%
point to where they've had some violence
 
06:19:31.788 --> 06:19:31.798 align:start position:0%
erupt inside because they're just not
 
06:19:34.190 --> 06:19:34.200 align:start position:0%
adequately staffed and so there's a
 
06:19:36.110 --> 06:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
saying this is something like it's it's
 
06:19:38.150 --> 06:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
hard to remember you went into during
 
06:19:40.070 --> 06:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
the swamp when you're wrestling with
 
06:19:43.570 --> 06:19:43.580 align:start position:0%
alligators and so I I think that the the
 
06:19:47.510 --> 06:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
declining staff has it has made it more
 
06:19:49.368 --> 06:19:49.378 align:start position:0%
challenging for them to begin
 
06:19:51.230 --> 06:19:51.240 align:start position:0%
implementing the therapeutic model
 
06:19:54.350 --> 06:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
changes but to the extent that they have
 
06:19:57.110 --> 06:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
I'd give them Kudos because it's you
 
06:20:00.470 --> 06:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
know it's tough to do it in the face of
 
06:20:00.480 --> 06:20:01.970 align:start position:0%
know it's tough to do it in the face of
massive

06:20:01.970 --> 06:20:01.980 align:start position:0%
massive
 
06:20:01.980 --> 06:20:04.190 align:start position:0%
massive
attrition

06:20:04.190 --> 06:20:04.200 align:start position:0%
attrition
 
06:20:07.548 --> 06:20:07.558 align:start position:0%
further questions for the representative
 
06:20:09.770 --> 06:20:09.780 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you and we'll see you
 
06:20:11.448 --> 06:20:11.458 align:start position:0%
again next week all right thank you so
 
06:20:13.910 --> 06:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
much for the time the chair recognizes
 
06:20:16.128 --> 06:20:16.138 align:start position:0%
Cassandra Sanchez Office of the child
 
06:20:18.830 --> 06:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
advocate she wants to speak for between
 
06:20:20.990 --> 06:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
two and five minutes in support of the
 
06:20:30.410 --> 06:20:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:32.270 --> 06:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chair and thank you
 
06:20:33.650 --> 06:20:33.660 align:start position:0%
for your time
 
06:20:36.830 --> 06:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
I am here in support of the bill and I
 
06:20:37.970 --> 06:20:37.980 align:start position:0%
may be able to answer some prior
 
06:20:39.288 --> 06:20:39.298 align:start position:0%
questions that were asked as well about
 
06:20:41.208 --> 06:20:41.218 align:start position:0%
the treatment model the office of the
 
06:20:43.788 --> 06:20:43.798 align:start position:0%
child advocate has been very vocal in
 
06:20:46.910 --> 06:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
pushing for a treatment Approach at the
 
06:20:50.390 --> 06:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
facility and moving to a therapeutic
 
06:20:53.530 --> 06:20:53.540 align:start position:0%
home-like facility away from as
 
06:20:55.788 --> 06:20:55.798 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards mentioned away
 
06:20:58.310 --> 06:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
from the brick walls the heavy metal
 
06:21:01.430 --> 06:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
doors to a facility that will feel more
 
06:21:03.350 --> 06:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
like a treatment center
 
06:21:05.090 --> 06:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
and so in this bill we have been very
 
06:21:07.670 --> 06:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
supportive of all of the aspects that
 
06:21:09.708 --> 06:21:09.718 align:start position:0%
include those treatment modalities to be
 
06:21:11.750 --> 06:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
used and especially the implementation
 
06:21:14.690 --> 06:21:14.700 align:start position:0%
of them now at the current facility
 
06:21:16.128 --> 06:21:16.138 align:start position:0%
I do spend quite some time at the
 
06:21:17.930 --> 06:21:17.940 align:start position:0%
current facility I've met with the
 
06:21:19.730 --> 06:21:19.740 align:start position:0%
children talked to them about their the
 
06:21:21.910 --> 06:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
current therapeutic treatment as well as
 
06:21:25.730 --> 06:21:25.740 align:start position:0%
the psychologist that oversees the
 
06:21:25.740 --> 06:21:27.230 align:start position:0%
the psychologist that oversees the
clinical

06:21:27.230 --> 06:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
clinical
 
06:21:29.030 --> 06:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
um therapeutic components that already
 
06:21:31.310 --> 06:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
exist within the program
 
06:21:34.070 --> 06:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
and currently at this time the children
 
06:21:36.770 --> 06:21:36.780 align:start position:0%
are receiving one-on-one therapy they
 
06:21:39.350 --> 06:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
have opportunities for family therapy as
 
06:21:42.830 --> 06:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
well as group therapy the group therapy
 
06:21:45.650 --> 06:21:45.660 align:start position:0%
was not consistently happening prior to
 
06:21:47.208 --> 06:21:47.218 align:start position:0%
this current time frame because of the
 
06:21:49.628 --> 06:21:49.638 align:start position:0%
staffing issues that were mentioned
 
06:21:52.368 --> 06:21:52.378 align:start position:0%
by representative Edwards Pryor so there
 
06:21:54.230 --> 06:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
was with this the crisis in the facility
 
06:21:56.330 --> 06:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
in the unknown there was departure of
 
06:21:57.830 --> 06:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
clinical staff and there was need for
 
06:21:59.810 --> 06:21:59.820 align:start position:0%
hiring of clinical staff they now have
 
06:22:01.310 --> 06:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
more adequate clinical staff and are
 
06:22:02.750 --> 06:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
able to meet those needs by offering
 
06:22:04.850 --> 06:22:04.860 align:start position:0%
more of that therapeutic component
 
06:22:07.910 --> 06:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
I don't believe they are where we would
 
06:22:10.190 --> 06:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
like to see them when this fully rolls
 
06:22:11.510 --> 06:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
out and they're able to further
 
06:22:14.090 --> 06:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
Implement that therapeutic approach but
 
06:22:15.948 --> 06:22:15.958 align:start position:0%
they are on the way already with the
 
06:22:20.030 --> 06:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:21.770 --> 06:22:21.780 align:start position:0%
um what I do see for in speaking to the
 
06:22:24.530 --> 06:22:24.540 align:start position:0%
de-escalation question that was asked in
 
06:22:26.090 --> 06:22:26.100 align:start position:0%
my understanding
 
06:22:28.250 --> 06:22:28.260 align:start position:0%
um of the science behind de-escalation
 
06:22:30.110 --> 06:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
in in therapeutic settings for children
 
06:22:33.230 --> 06:22:33.240 align:start position:0%
it is about using approaches where you
 
06:22:35.448 --> 06:22:35.458 align:start position:0%
are talking to them in the moment it is
 
06:22:37.310 --> 06:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
having the treatment plans in place that
 
06:22:39.470 --> 06:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
identify coping skills for the child so
 
06:22:41.750 --> 06:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
if they are in crisis it's offering them
 
06:22:43.970 --> 06:22:43.980 align:start position:0%
their coping skills first getting down
 
06:22:45.350 --> 06:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
on their level meeting them where
 
06:22:47.510 --> 06:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
they're at and understanding what may be
 
06:22:49.368 --> 06:22:49.378 align:start position:0%
triggering to them in that moment so
 
06:22:51.470 --> 06:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
that that is not that approach isn't
 
06:22:53.448 --> 06:22:53.458 align:start position:0%
utilized so if it is somebody coming too
 
06:22:54.830 --> 06:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
close in contact with them it may be
 
06:22:56.330 --> 06:22:56.340 align:start position:0%
taking a step back and showing them that
 
06:22:57.530 --> 06:22:57.540 align:start position:0%
you're giving them the space that they
 
06:22:59.208 --> 06:22:59.218 align:start position:0%
need and so that's what we see for
 
06:23:00.830 --> 06:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
de-escalation techniques and other
 
06:23:02.810 --> 06:23:02.820 align:start position:0%
therapeutic settings and we would like
 
06:23:04.070 --> 06:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
to see that carry through at the
 
06:23:06.048 --> 06:23:06.058 align:start position:0%
facility some of that has been
 
06:23:07.730 --> 06:23:07.740 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the treatment plans
 
06:23:10.310 --> 06:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
already but there is a training
 
06:23:13.010 --> 06:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
component that would come with this bill
 
06:23:15.310 --> 06:23:15.320 align:start position:0%
that would allow further training for
 
06:23:18.350 --> 06:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
the Direct Care staff because right now
 
06:23:20.448 --> 06:23:20.458 align:start position:0%
the clinical staff are on site but
 
06:23:21.948 --> 06:23:21.958 align:start position:0%
they're not on the floor with the kids
 
06:23:24.288 --> 06:23:24.298 align:start position:0%
at all times and so they the training
 
06:23:25.670 --> 06:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
needs to happen with the staff that are
 
06:23:27.890 --> 06:23:27.900 align:start position:0%
directly working with the children on
 
06:23:30.890 --> 06:23:30.900 align:start position:0%
their units in the the lunchrooms when
 
06:23:32.208 --> 06:23:32.218 align:start position:0%
they're mixing when they're socializing
 
06:23:33.830 --> 06:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
and also in the education setting so
 
06:23:36.048 --> 06:23:36.058 align:start position:0%
really carrying that through and that
 
06:23:37.970 --> 06:23:37.980 align:start position:0%
can happen through enhanced training
 
06:23:39.590 --> 06:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
they're doing some of those trauma
 
06:23:42.590 --> 06:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
trainings now but with the roll out and
 
06:23:46.010 --> 06:23:46.020 align:start position:0%
the Prime Focus shifting from detention
 
06:23:48.230 --> 06:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
center to treatment center that will be
 
06:23:50.510 --> 06:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
able to enhance
 
06:23:54.770 --> 06:23:54.780 align:start position:0%
I will point out one aspect of of this
 
06:23:57.770 --> 06:23:57.780 align:start position:0%
amendment which I did vocalize to the
 
06:23:59.628 --> 06:23:59.638 align:start position:0%
Senate as well
 
06:24:01.310 --> 06:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
um one area of concern otherwise I
 
06:24:05.090 --> 06:24:05.100 align:start position:0%
support this amendment in full the area
 
06:24:08.090 --> 06:24:08.100 align:start position:0%
of concern is in speaking to the
 
06:24:10.788 --> 06:24:10.798 align:start position:0%
utilization of virtual and shared
 
06:24:10.798 --> 06:24:11.930 align:start position:0%
utilization of virtual and shared
services

06:24:11.930 --> 06:24:11.940 align:start position:0%
services
 
06:24:14.030 --> 06:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
and this is not saying that I don't
 
06:24:15.650 --> 06:24:15.660 align:start position:0%
believe that that should be offered to
 
06:24:18.048 --> 06:24:18.058 align:start position:0%
the children at the facility but I do
 
06:24:20.090 --> 06:24:20.100 align:start position:0%
believe that it should be considered an
 
06:24:22.368 --> 06:24:22.378 align:start position:0%
add-on to the services already in place
 
06:24:24.890 --> 06:24:24.900 align:start position:0%
understanding the amount of work that
 
06:24:28.070 --> 06:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
has gone into the face-to-face Clinical
 
06:24:30.230 --> 06:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
Services that are happening now I would
 
06:24:32.090 --> 06:24:32.100 align:start position:0%
not like to see the facility take a step
 
06:24:36.110 --> 06:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
backwards and utilize virtual therapy or
 
06:24:39.048 --> 06:24:39.058 align:start position:0%
virtual schooling for children with IEPs
 
06:24:40.490 --> 06:24:40.500 align:start position:0%
if it's not going to truly meet their
 
06:24:42.048 --> 06:24:42.058 align:start position:0%
needs so really taking a look at the
 
06:24:44.330 --> 06:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
virtual component as an add-on to the
 
06:24:45.708 --> 06:24:45.718 align:start position:0%
in-person services that will be
 
06:24:47.150 --> 06:24:47.160 align:start position:0%
happening face to face with the children
 
06:24:49.430 --> 06:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
I absolutely see that it can be an
 
06:24:51.830 --> 06:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
enhancement by having a therapist in the
 
06:24:53.330 --> 06:24:53.340 align:start position:0%
community who has followed the child
 
06:24:55.548 --> 06:24:55.558 align:start position:0%
over time to have access to them while
 
06:24:56.930 --> 06:24:56.940 align:start position:0%
they're in the facility and communicate
 
06:24:58.670 --> 06:24:58.680 align:start position:0%
with their treatment team
 
06:25:00.470 --> 06:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
but they should still have that because
 
06:25:01.850 --> 06:25:01.860 align:start position:0%
they will not have the opportunity to
 
06:25:03.650 --> 06:25:03.660 align:start position:0%
meet with that person face to face they
 
06:25:05.090 --> 06:25:05.100 align:start position:0%
should still have the opportunity to
 
06:25:07.610 --> 06:25:07.620 align:start position:0%
meet with a clinician on-site face to
 
06:25:10.070 --> 06:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
face and have that treatment come
 
06:25:13.310 --> 06:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
together as one and not two separate
 
06:25:15.770 --> 06:25:15.780 align:start position:0%
um options for for therapeutic care for
 
06:25:19.670 --> 06:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:22.788 --> 06:25:22.798 align:start position:0%
I read that line to mean if the facility
 
06:25:25.548 --> 06:25:25.558 align:start position:0%
were cited right next to another
 
06:25:27.890 --> 06:25:27.900 align:start position:0%
facility doing similar work that could
 
06:25:29.448 --> 06:25:29.458 align:start position:0%
share Food Service since they'll not
 
06:25:31.490 --> 06:25:31.500 align:start position:0%
have to have two completely separate
 
06:25:34.670 --> 06:25:34.680 align:start position:0%
ones and that if let's say Hampstead
 
06:25:37.548 --> 06:25:37.558 align:start position:0%
Hospital has certain staff people gifted
 
06:25:39.948 --> 06:25:39.958 align:start position:0%
in certain areas of mental health those
 
06:25:42.490 --> 06:25:42.500 align:start position:0%
people could actually work at both
 
06:25:45.650 --> 06:25:45.660 align:start position:0%
under that heading I would see that
 
06:25:48.470 --> 06:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
shared services could be an advantage
 
06:25:50.510 --> 06:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
and not a disadvantage
 
06:25:53.090 --> 06:25:53.100 align:start position:0%
in that aspect yes I'm speaking more to
 
06:25:54.830 --> 06:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
the virtual component not necessarily
 
06:25:56.448 --> 06:25:56.458 align:start position:0%
the shared services thank you for that
 
06:25:58.368 --> 06:25:58.378 align:start position:0%
clarification thank you representative
 
06:25:58.378 --> 06:25:59.570 align:start position:0%
clarification thank you representative
McMahon

06:25:59.570 --> 06:25:59.580 align:start position:0%
McMahon
 
06:26:02.868 --> 06:26:02.878 align:start position:0%
Ms Sanchez uh this is specific to what
 
06:26:04.850 --> 06:26:04.860 align:start position:0%
the chair just referred to as well
 
06:26:07.850 --> 06:26:07.860 align:start position:0%
would wording saying operations shall
 
06:26:10.128 --> 06:26:10.138 align:start position:0%
include utilization
 
06:26:14.330 --> 06:26:14.340 align:start position:0%
of virtual shared and in-person services
 
06:26:16.788 --> 06:26:16.798 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry can you point me to the the
 
06:26:21.048 --> 06:26:21.058 align:start position:0%
line that was on uh page 2 line 26. oh
 
06:26:23.030 --> 06:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
yes yep
 
06:26:25.910 --> 06:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
and in in the interest of inclusion so
 
06:26:28.250 --> 06:26:28.260 align:start position:0%
that the three disciplines can be
 
06:26:29.868 --> 06:26:29.878 align:start position:0%
recognized based on need of the
 
06:26:29.878 --> 06:26:30.948 align:start position:0%
recognized based on need of the
individual

06:26:30.948 --> 06:26:30.958 align:start position:0%
individual
 
06:26:33.410 --> 06:26:33.420 align:start position:0%
is is that do I understand that's what
 
06:26:35.208 --> 06:26:35.218 align:start position:0%
you're recommending those suggesting
 
06:26:37.788 --> 06:26:37.798 align:start position:0%
should be included
 
06:26:39.350 --> 06:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
those three options or should one of
 
06:26:40.850 --> 06:26:40.860 align:start position:0%
them be
 
06:26:44.750 --> 06:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:47.048 --> 06:26:47.058 align:start position:0%
I believe there's another location
 
06:26:49.910 --> 06:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
where it touches on
 
06:26:52.010 --> 06:26:52.020 align:start position:0%
um a virtual component and I believe
 
06:26:54.890 --> 06:26:54.900 align:start position:0%
it's in the education area
 
06:26:58.128 --> 06:26:58.138 align:start position:0%
um what page in line would that be
 
06:27:05.628 --> 06:27:05.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:09.590 --> 06:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:11.510 --> 06:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
Shelby yes right there it notes virtual
 
06:27:13.010 --> 06:27:13.020 align:start position:0%
education opportunity shall be leveraged
 
06:27:14.150 --> 06:27:14.160 align:start position:0%
appropriately to help meet the
 
06:27:16.070 --> 06:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
resident's needs so ensuring that this
 
06:27:18.830 --> 06:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
would not allow this language would not
 
06:27:20.868 --> 06:27:20.878 align:start position:0%
allow it to be
 
06:27:24.230 --> 06:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
used instead of but as an option if it
 
06:27:26.330 --> 06:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
is a good fit for that specific child
 
06:27:29.090 --> 06:27:29.100 align:start position:0%
but not that if there's not access to an
 
06:27:30.410 --> 06:27:30.420 align:start position:0%
educator that they will be able to
 
06:27:32.930 --> 06:27:32.940 align:start position:0%
supplement by offering virtual only to
 
06:27:36.190 --> 06:27:36.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:36.200 --> 06:27:37.910 align:start position:0%
 
uh

06:27:37.910 --> 06:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:27:41.330 --> 06:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
uh well well the question was specific
 
06:27:43.850 --> 06:27:43.860 align:start position:0%
to it including the three opportunities
 
06:27:46.190 --> 06:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
and what is the best uh therapy to
 
06:27:46.200 --> 06:27:47.150 align:start position:0%
and what is the best uh therapy to
utilize

06:27:47.150 --> 06:27:47.160 align:start position:0%
utilize
 
06:27:50.330 --> 06:27:50.340 align:start position:0%
would would then go to the the second uh
 
06:27:54.170 --> 06:27:54.180 align:start position:0%
the second uh page there you were just
 
06:27:57.048 --> 06:27:57.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:59.330 --> 06:27:59.340 align:start position:0%
I mean should that not be included as a
 
06:28:01.490 --> 06:28:01.500 align:start position:0%
as you know so the options there's the
 
06:28:04.330 --> 06:28:04.340 align:start position:0%
three options are available
 
06:28:07.070 --> 06:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
not restricted
 
06:28:08.750 --> 06:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
you know it's I mean leverage can
 
06:28:10.548 --> 06:28:10.558 align:start position:0%
Leverage is a matter of leveraging
 
06:28:14.030 --> 06:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
multiple entities yes so yes it can be
 
06:28:16.250 --> 06:28:16.260 align:start position:0%
utilized it's just I'm making note to
 
06:28:18.948 --> 06:28:18.958 align:start position:0%
ensure that it could not be intended
 
06:28:22.548 --> 06:28:22.558 align:start position:0%
instead of but that it joining in both
 
06:28:24.230 --> 06:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
or in addition to what is already
 
06:28:26.448 --> 06:28:26.458 align:start position:0%
offered on site then yes I am in
 
06:28:27.890 --> 06:28:27.900 align:start position:0%
agreement with that opportunity being
 
06:28:29.868 --> 06:28:29.878 align:start position:0%
available to the children so is there
 
06:28:31.730 --> 06:28:31.740 align:start position:0%
any further language change versus what
 
06:28:34.910 --> 06:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
was offered here by representative
 
06:28:34.920 --> 06:28:36.708 align:start position:0%
was offered here by representative
Edwards

06:28:36.708 --> 06:28:36.718 align:start position:0%
Edwards
 
06:28:40.310 --> 06:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
I have not offered any additional
 
06:28:42.590 --> 06:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
specific language to that I did speak in
 
06:28:44.750 --> 06:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
the Senate with asking as they're
 
06:28:46.610 --> 06:28:46.620 align:start position:0%
considering to look at amendments to
 
06:28:49.850 --> 06:28:49.860 align:start position:0%
have that language say in addition to
 
06:28:52.128 --> 06:28:52.138 align:start position:0%
um but further than that I have not had
 
06:28:53.570 --> 06:28:53.580 align:start position:0%
further conversation with representative
 
06:28:56.930 --> 06:28:56.940 align:start position:0%
Edwards as to Amendment language
 
06:28:59.330 --> 06:28:59.340 align:start position:0%
my guess would be that this would be
 
06:29:02.090 --> 06:29:02.100 align:start position:0%
unpacked by the department as it
 
06:29:05.628 --> 06:29:05.638 align:start position:0%
implements it and we can trust that they
 
06:29:07.010 --> 06:29:07.020 align:start position:0%
know how to do it
 
06:29:08.868 --> 06:29:08.878 align:start position:0%
as opposed to making sure it's written
 
06:29:11.330 --> 06:29:11.340 align:start position:0%
right in the bill
 
06:29:13.430 --> 06:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
that wasn't a question but it could have
 
06:29:13.440 --> 06:29:14.448 align:start position:0%
that wasn't a question but it could have
been

06:29:14.448 --> 06:29:14.458 align:start position:0%
been
 
06:29:17.750 --> 06:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
anybody else uh Mr chairman you're on a
 
06:29:20.090 --> 06:29:20.100 align:start position:0%
roll go I am do you trust what the chair
 
06:29:24.830 --> 06:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:28.150 --> 06:29:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:28.160 --> 06:29:29.990 align:start position:0%
 
uh

06:29:29.990 --> 06:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:29:33.530 --> 06:29:33.540 align:start position:0%
so respectfully I do I do trust that
 
06:29:33.540 --> 06:29:34.610 align:start position:0%
so respectfully I do I do trust that
that

06:29:34.610 --> 06:29:34.620 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:29:36.890 --> 06:29:36.900 align:start position:0%
they can do their duty but I would like
 
06:29:38.930 --> 06:29:38.940 align:start position:0%
to be cautious knowing that there have
 
06:29:40.490 --> 06:29:40.500 align:start position:0%
been times where staffing has been an
 
06:29:43.128 --> 06:29:43.138 align:start position:0%
issue and have seen that the virtual
 
06:29:45.890 --> 06:29:45.900 align:start position:0%
option had been the only option for
 
06:29:47.690 --> 06:29:47.700 align:start position:0%
children so that is why I brought that
 
06:29:49.010 --> 06:29:49.020 align:start position:0%
forward because I did speak with
 
06:29:50.810 --> 06:29:50.820 align:start position:0%
children over the summer months where
 
06:29:52.788 --> 06:29:52.798 align:start position:0%
the Staffing was not in place and there
 
06:29:56.750 --> 06:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
was virtual therapy offered to them and
 
06:29:58.430 --> 06:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
many children at that time voiced that
 
06:30:00.110 --> 06:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
it was not enough to meet their needs
 
06:30:02.270 --> 06:30:02.280 align:start position:0%
and that they needed further therapeutic
 
06:30:04.910 --> 06:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
care in the facility just one closings
 
06:30:07.490 --> 06:30:07.500 align:start position:0%
comment Mr chairman my attempted human
 
06:30:11.270 --> 06:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding the uh point is well
 
06:30:13.250 --> 06:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
taken here and then our past experience
 
06:30:15.470 --> 06:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
with my past experience working with the
 
06:30:18.650 --> 06:30:18.660 align:start position:0%
chair and other committees is to
 
06:30:20.868 --> 06:30:20.878 align:start position:0%
anticipate what not what's happening
 
06:30:23.330 --> 06:30:23.340 align:start position:0%
what what may happen and what does
 
06:30:26.030 --> 06:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
happen and you'll be working them with
 
06:30:28.430 --> 06:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
the Senate and with represent the
 
06:30:30.890 --> 06:30:30.900 align:start position:0%
representative to have a language that
 
06:30:33.590 --> 06:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
provides that the structure for these
 
06:30:38.270 --> 06:30:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:40.670 --> 06:30:40.680 align:start position:0%
in blackletta law
 
06:30:44.628 --> 06:30:44.638 align:start position:0%
and on page 3 line 29 it indicates the
 
06:30:46.310 --> 06:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
06:30:49.310 --> 06:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
shall submit quarterly progress reports
 
06:30:53.208 --> 06:30:53.218 align:start position:0%
to the Joint legislative committee on
 
06:30:57.170 --> 06:30:57.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:58.730 --> 06:30:58.740 align:start position:0%
I'll make sure
 
06:31:01.070 --> 06:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
06:31:03.948 --> 06:31:03.958 align:start position:0%
anyone else we take do we take minutes
 
06:31:15.948 --> 06:31:15.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:17.930 --> 06:31:17.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
06:31:19.788 --> 06:31:19.798 align:start position:0%
um and thank you Miss uh Sanchez for
 
06:31:21.650 --> 06:31:21.660 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
06:31:22.730 --> 06:31:22.740 align:start position:0%
um on
 
06:31:25.070 --> 06:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
page three
 
06:31:25.080 --> 06:31:26.030 align:start position:0%
page three
um

06:31:26.030 --> 06:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:31:28.670 --> 06:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
number five which uh Roman numeral five
 
06:31:30.230 --> 06:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
which is line 26. it says the Department
 
06:31:31.910 --> 06:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services shell began
 
06:31:34.250 --> 06:31:34.260 align:start position:0%
to implement the programming changes and
 
06:31:37.010 --> 06:31:37.020 align:start position:0%
subparagraphs for a through K without
 
06:31:38.750 --> 06:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
regard to whether children are at the
 
06:31:41.750 --> 06:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
syfc or the new facility as soon as a
 
06:31:44.030 --> 06:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
reasonably practical
 
06:31:45.830 --> 06:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
um and that I have to say is my favorite
 
06:31:48.048 --> 06:31:48.058 align:start position:0%
line in this entire Bell
 
06:31:52.368 --> 06:31:52.378 align:start position:0%
um but I'm curious as to whether or not
 
06:31:55.670 --> 06:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
um it is practical to implement some of
 
06:31:59.030 --> 06:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
these programming changes in the current
 
06:32:01.070 --> 06:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
environment are there things in here
 
06:32:04.368 --> 06:32:04.378 align:start position:0%
that simply cannot happen until a new
 
06:32:07.970 --> 06:32:07.980 align:start position:0%
facility is built because I know that
 
06:32:09.708 --> 06:32:09.718 align:start position:0%
we're in the middle of a big renovation
 
06:32:11.868 --> 06:32:11.878 align:start position:0%
in Nashua and I know how long these
 
06:32:13.490 --> 06:32:13.500 align:start position:0%
things take
 
06:32:15.948 --> 06:32:15.958 align:start position:0%
um so you know are there things that we
 
06:32:17.990 --> 06:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
need to be concerned about that the kids
 
06:32:20.810 --> 06:32:20.820 align:start position:0%
need now that they may not be able to
 
06:32:22.070 --> 06:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
get yet
 
06:32:24.890 --> 06:32:24.900 align:start position:0%
I do believe that it is practicable to
 
06:32:26.990 --> 06:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
roll this out now for the children in
 
06:32:28.850 --> 06:32:28.860 align:start position:0%
the facility a lot of it as I had
 
06:32:30.530 --> 06:32:30.540 align:start position:0%
mentioned comes down to training of the
 
06:32:34.850 --> 06:32:34.860 align:start position:0%
staff and the current
 
06:32:36.770 --> 06:32:36.780 align:start position:0%
um so changing some of the current
 
06:32:39.350 --> 06:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
policy that aligns with the way in which
 
06:32:41.330 --> 06:32:41.340 align:start position:0%
the facility operates which can be done
 
06:32:43.250 --> 06:32:43.260 align:start position:0%
in the current facility of course with
 
06:32:45.830 --> 06:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic full facility built
 
06:32:45.840 --> 06:32:47.270 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic full facility built
therapeutically

06:32:47.270 --> 06:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
therapeutically
 
06:32:49.730 --> 06:32:49.740 align:start position:0%
it will offer more opportunities for
 
06:32:51.350 --> 06:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
children to
 
06:32:53.750 --> 06:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
um de-escalate potentially on their own
 
06:32:53.760 --> 06:32:54.948 align:start position:0%
um de-escalate potentially on their own
or

06:32:54.948 --> 06:32:54.958 align:start position:0%
or
 
06:32:58.070 --> 06:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
um and also we understand the the impact
 
06:33:01.430 --> 06:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
of being in a facility that appears like
 
06:33:03.110 --> 06:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
a Detention Facility like they are in
 
06:33:05.570 --> 06:33:05.580 align:start position:0%
now which can be further traumatizing
 
06:33:06.890 --> 06:33:06.900 align:start position:0%
for the children so by pulling that
 
06:33:09.288 --> 06:33:09.298 align:start position:0%
aspect away that will help with the
 
06:33:11.330 --> 06:33:11.340 align:start position:0%
treatment progress but that will not
 
06:33:13.548 --> 06:33:13.558 align:start position:0%
derail the ability to start that
 
06:33:15.288 --> 06:33:15.298 align:start position:0%
therapeutic process now and start making
 
06:33:16.850 --> 06:33:16.860 align:start position:0%
some of those changes to the policies
 
06:33:19.128 --> 06:33:19.138 align:start position:0%
and and the practices that occur in the
 
06:33:21.970 --> 06:33:21.980 align:start position:0%
facility okay thank you
 
06:33:24.230 --> 06:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford
 
06:33:26.208 --> 06:33:26.218 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
06:33:28.250 --> 06:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
we've heard this therapeutic word for
 
06:33:30.890 --> 06:33:30.900 align:start position:0%
years in fact when we started the sununu
 
06:33:32.448 --> 06:33:32.458 align:start position:0%
center we heard it's going to be
 
06:33:33.948 --> 06:33:33.958 align:start position:0%
therapeutic so don't worry about
 
06:33:36.230 --> 06:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
anything and here we are
 
06:33:36.240 --> 06:33:37.430 align:start position:0%
anything and here we are
um

06:33:37.430 --> 06:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:33:40.250 --> 06:33:40.260 align:start position:0%
now you commented that
 
06:33:42.110 --> 06:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
uh you didn't like the idea of the
 
06:33:46.310 --> 06:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
bricks and mortar and Buzz on it how do
 
06:33:49.128 --> 06:33:49.138 align:start position:0%
you envision Envision this to
 
06:33:51.230 --> 06:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
be constructed
 
06:33:53.270 --> 06:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
I envisioned the facility to look more
 
06:33:55.250 --> 06:33:55.260 align:start position:0%
of what we see when we would visit a
 
06:33:57.890 --> 06:33:57.900 align:start position:0%
residential facility in the state where
 
06:33:59.868 --> 06:33:59.878 align:start position:0%
they do there's it's a smaller building
 
06:34:02.628 --> 06:34:02.638 align:start position:0%
some of them may even be a house and
 
06:34:05.868 --> 06:34:05.878 align:start position:0%
they're able to outfit the inside with
 
06:34:08.208 --> 06:34:08.218 align:start position:0%
the necessary video cameras But the
 
06:34:10.310 --> 06:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
rooms won't don't necessarily have those
 
06:34:12.948 --> 06:34:12.958 align:start position:0%
heavy doors that that lock in the same
 
06:34:14.930 --> 06:34:14.940 align:start position:0%
way and moving through the the building
 
06:34:16.788 --> 06:34:16.798 align:start position:0%
also would not necessarily have those
 
06:34:18.610 --> 06:34:18.620 align:start position:0%
though it would be a locked facility
 
06:34:20.868 --> 06:34:20.878 align:start position:0%
unlike the residential facilities but it
 
06:34:23.510 --> 06:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have those locks in in between
 
06:34:26.448 --> 06:34:26.458 align:start position:0%
as they're entering or moving about the
 
06:34:29.990 --> 06:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
facility and it would have a space where
 
06:34:33.110 --> 06:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
children can join and mix together that
 
06:34:34.730 --> 06:34:34.740 align:start position:0%
would feel more like your living room at
 
06:34:37.250 --> 06:34:37.260 align:start position:0%
home than being in what feels like an
 
06:34:39.350 --> 06:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
office space right now
 
06:34:41.570 --> 06:34:41.580 align:start position:0%
okay so that's kind of follow-up
 
06:34:43.730 --> 06:34:43.740 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you yes
 
06:34:46.190 --> 06:34:46.200 align:start position:0%
that's kind of where we came from from a
 
06:34:47.510 --> 06:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
king cottages
 
06:34:49.970 --> 06:34:49.980 align:start position:0%
where they had Cottages or large
 
06:34:51.650 --> 06:34:51.660 align:start position:0%
Cottages actually
 
06:34:53.628 --> 06:34:53.638 align:start position:0%
so we're going full circle
 
06:34:55.970 --> 06:34:55.980 align:start position:0%
so do you happen to know
 
06:34:58.548 --> 06:34:58.558 align:start position:0%
what the cost will be to run this
 
06:34:58.558 --> 06:34:59.990 align:start position:0%
what the cost will be to run this
facility

06:34:59.990 --> 06:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
facility
 
06:35:02.208 --> 06:35:02.218 align:start position:0%
the new facility
 
06:35:04.430 --> 06:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
I do not have the operating costs I will
 
06:35:08.628 --> 06:35:08.638 align:start position:0%
defer to DHHS for that oh okay thank you
 
06:35:10.910 --> 06:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:35:13.430 --> 06:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
I see no hands up
 
06:35:20.990 --> 06:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:24.048 --> 06:35:24.058 align:start position:0%
sure recognizes Karen Rosenberg
 
06:35:25.910 --> 06:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
disability rights Center of New
 
06:35:28.490 --> 06:35:28.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and up here she writes she
 
06:35:31.788 --> 06:35:31.798 align:start position:0%
supports the bill but requests
 
06:35:43.730 --> 06:35:43.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:45.708 --> 06:35:45.718 align:start position:0%
um good afternoon I'm Karen Rosenberg
 
06:35:47.090 --> 06:35:47.100 align:start position:0%
I'm the policy director at the
 
06:35:48.350 --> 06:35:48.360 align:start position:0%
disability rights Center of New
 
06:35:50.690 --> 06:35:50.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm here to testify on behalf
 
06:35:52.250 --> 06:35:52.260 align:start position:0%
of the disability rights Center as well
 
06:35:54.230 --> 06:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
as the juvenile rights policy Group
 
06:35:57.230 --> 06:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
which is a coalition of several advocacy
 
06:35:58.910 --> 06:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
organizations who advocate for children
 
06:36:01.788 --> 06:36:01.798 align:start position:0%
including Waypoint New Hampshire legal
 
06:36:04.310 --> 06:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
assistance the ACLU New Hampshire and
 
06:36:05.570 --> 06:36:05.580 align:start position:0%
new futures
 
06:36:08.930 --> 06:36:08.940 align:start position:0%
so first of all yes this has to happen
 
06:36:12.110 --> 06:36:12.120 align:start position:0%
and you all and representative Edwards
 
06:36:13.970 --> 06:36:13.980 align:start position:0%
and Folks at the Senate have done a
 
06:36:16.930 --> 06:36:16.940 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of work really rapidly
 
06:36:21.590 --> 06:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
to advance what will hopefully be a bill
 
06:36:23.330 --> 06:36:23.340 align:start position:0%
that will cross the finish line this
 
06:36:26.628 --> 06:36:26.638 align:start position:0%
time that will keep Kids Safe that will
 
06:36:30.288 --> 06:36:30.298 align:start position:0%
result in a therapeutic treatment model
 
06:36:33.890 --> 06:36:33.900 align:start position:0%
for children who need to be detained or
 
06:36:36.170 --> 06:36:36.180 align:start position:0%
committed to a secure facility for a
 
06:36:38.510 --> 06:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
brief period of time both for their
 
06:36:40.010 --> 06:36:40.020 align:start position:0%
treatment needs as well as for Community
 
06:36:42.048 --> 06:36:42.058 align:start position:0%
safety and you're well on your way to
 
06:36:43.368 --> 06:36:43.378 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
06:36:48.530 --> 06:36:48.540 align:start position:0%
so in part my request is that you
 
06:36:51.288 --> 06:36:51.298 align:start position:0%
um adopt what's in representative
 
06:36:53.930 --> 06:36:53.940 align:start position:0%
Edwards proposed amendment which mirrors
 
06:36:58.970 --> 06:36:58.980 align:start position:0%
the Senate bill with one tweak
 
06:37:01.610 --> 06:37:01.620 align:start position:0%
um The Tweak is that we want to make
 
06:37:05.810 --> 06:37:05.820 align:start position:0%
sure that this facility is owned and
 
06:37:11.030 --> 06:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
operated by the department and I I think
 
06:37:14.628 --> 06:37:14.638 align:start position:0%
that it's really the intent of the
 
06:37:18.410 --> 06:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
Senate and hopefully the house that that
 
06:37:20.930 --> 06:37:20.940 align:start position:0%
be the case but
 
06:37:23.990 --> 06:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
being an attorney you know who went
 
06:37:25.548 --> 06:37:25.558 align:start position:0%
through that whole you know law school
 
06:37:27.830 --> 06:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
lives her entire life a you know worst
 
06:37:29.628 --> 06:37:29.638 align:start position:0%
case scenario
 
06:37:29.638 --> 06:37:30.650 align:start position:0%
case scenario
um

06:37:30.650 --> 06:37:30.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:37:33.110 --> 06:37:33.120 align:start position:0%
we would encourage you to make sure that
 
06:37:35.448 --> 06:37:35.458 align:start position:0%
it's absolutely clear I mean this is
 
06:37:38.330 --> 06:37:38.340 align:start position:0%
important because with State ownership
 
06:37:41.890 --> 06:37:41.900 align:start position:0%
and operation we have transparency right
 
06:37:47.030 --> 06:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
we have unconditional oversight we have
 
06:37:49.548 --> 06:37:49.558 align:start position:0%
the applicability of our state right to
 
06:37:53.690 --> 06:37:53.700 align:start position:0%
know law we know with ownership that if
 
06:37:56.448 --> 06:37:56.458 align:start position:0%
there is a contract and the contract
 
06:37:58.850 --> 06:37:58.860 align:start position:0%
goes south that we will have a facility
 
06:38:00.590 --> 06:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
we're not just throwing 15 million
 
06:38:03.230 --> 06:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
dollars at some other entity
 
06:38:04.670 --> 06:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
um you know who we're Contracting with
 
06:38:08.690 --> 06:38:08.700 align:start position:0%
so I understand that that's the intent
 
06:38:10.610 --> 06:38:10.620 align:start position:0%
um but like I said in that worst case
 
06:38:13.548 --> 06:38:13.558 align:start position:0%
scenario game that you know some of us
 
06:38:14.810 --> 06:38:14.820 align:start position:0%
who went to law school can't get our
 
06:38:17.330 --> 06:38:17.340 align:start position:0%
heads out of it would be really clear to
 
06:38:19.030 --> 06:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
tighten up that language
 
06:38:22.208 --> 06:38:22.218 align:start position:0%
similarly with operate versus
 
06:38:25.128 --> 06:38:25.138 align:start position:0%
administrate the buck needs to stop with
 
06:38:27.830 --> 06:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
the state the state needs to be overall
 
06:38:30.048 --> 06:38:30.058 align:start position:0%
responsible for the operations to
 
06:38:32.150 --> 06:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
maintain this safety of the children
 
06:38:34.850 --> 06:38:34.860 align:start position:0%
there to make sure that this facility
 
06:38:34.860 --> 06:38:36.350 align:start position:0%
there to make sure that this facility
that

06:38:36.350 --> 06:38:36.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:38:40.250 --> 06:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
we all are going to create here is
 
06:38:42.470 --> 06:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
actually going to do what it says it's
 
06:38:44.868 --> 06:38:44.878 align:start position:0%
going to do in this bill right we want
 
06:38:46.610 --> 06:38:46.620 align:start position:0%
those kids to be safe we want to make
 
06:38:47.810 --> 06:38:47.820 align:start position:0%
sure that the office of the child
 
06:38:50.090 --> 06:38:50.100 align:start position:0%
advocate has appropriate access to this
 
06:38:51.530 --> 06:38:51.540 align:start position:0%
facility and the children that they're
 
06:38:53.390 --> 06:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
actually getting the therapeutic
 
06:38:56.150 --> 06:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
services that they need and that and and
 
06:38:57.948 --> 06:38:57.958 align:start position:0%
we can hold the state accountable to
 
06:39:00.530 --> 06:39:00.540 align:start position:0%
that so
 
06:39:02.510 --> 06:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
this is why the language is really
 
06:39:04.368 --> 06:39:04.378 align:start position:0%
important and it actually is not
 
06:39:06.410 --> 06:39:06.420 align:start position:0%
anything new I mean when you think about
 
06:39:08.810 --> 06:39:08.820 align:start position:0%
it the state already owns and operates
 
06:39:10.548 --> 06:39:10.558 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital this is not to
 
06:39:13.310 --> 06:39:13.320 align:start position:0%
preclude Contracting Services when
 
06:39:15.048 --> 06:39:15.058 align:start position:0%
appropriate right that's not the
 
06:39:16.430 --> 06:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
intention here we're not saying like
 
06:39:20.930 --> 06:39:20.940 align:start position:0%
state has to you know basically do every
 
06:39:23.570 --> 06:39:23.580 align:start position:0%
single thing ever all the minutiaev of
 
06:39:26.150 --> 06:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
actually running the facility but as we
 
06:39:27.708 --> 06:39:27.718 align:start position:0%
do with like New Hampshire hospital the
 
06:39:29.810 --> 06:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
state owns that facility they contract
 
06:39:31.310 --> 06:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
with Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center
 
06:39:33.048 --> 06:39:33.058 align:start position:0%
for Medical Services and Psychiatric
 
06:39:34.910 --> 06:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
Services so this has been done before
 
06:39:37.970 --> 06:39:37.980 align:start position:0%
similarly with Hampstead Hospital the
 
06:39:40.070 --> 06:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
arrangement is that the state owns it
 
06:39:43.128 --> 06:39:43.138 align:start position:0%
and operates it and I looked up recently
 
06:39:45.288 --> 06:39:45.298 align:start position:0%
the contract that we have that the
 
06:39:47.570 --> 06:39:47.580 align:start position:0%
request that the department filed with
 
06:39:49.970 --> 06:39:49.980 align:start position:0%
on the executive Council for permission
 
06:39:52.310 --> 06:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
to contract with an entity that provides
 
06:39:55.430 --> 06:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
services for Hampstead and it says the
 
06:39:57.048 --> 06:39:57.058 align:start position:0%
department will be the owner and
 
06:39:59.448 --> 06:39:59.458 align:start position:0%
operator responsible for all functions
 
06:40:01.430 --> 06:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
of this Hospital this includes
 
06:40:03.590 --> 06:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
developing overall Strategic Mission of
 
06:40:05.750 --> 06:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
Hampstead ensuring quality services are
 
06:40:07.730 --> 06:40:07.740 align:start position:0%
provided by the contractor in compliance
 
06:40:09.650 --> 06:40:09.660 align:start position:0%
with all contractual requirements as
 
06:40:11.690 --> 06:40:11.700 align:start position:0%
well as all federal and state laws and
 
06:40:13.730 --> 06:40:13.740 align:start position:0%
regulations I mean that's the kind of
 
06:40:15.650 --> 06:40:15.660 align:start position:0%
thing the assurance that we're looking
 
06:40:17.628 --> 06:40:17.638 align:start position:0%
for here and it could be accomplished
 
06:40:20.628 --> 06:40:20.638 align:start position:0%
with a really simple tweak which is just
 
06:40:23.030 --> 06:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
changing the word along the lines of
 
06:40:25.368 --> 06:40:25.378 align:start position:0%
what representative long was saying he's
 
06:40:28.430 --> 06:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
the tweaker so um and to make it clear
 
06:40:30.830 --> 06:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
that this facility would be owned
 
06:40:33.470 --> 06:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
operated and administered by the
 
06:40:33.480 --> 06:40:34.910 align:start position:0%
operated and administered by the
department

06:40:34.910 --> 06:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
department
 
06:40:37.250 --> 06:40:37.260 align:start position:0%
um but allowing for them I think the
 
06:40:39.288 --> 06:40:39.298 align:start position:0%
language that's already in the um
 
06:40:41.030 --> 06:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
Edwards Amendment
 
06:40:44.270 --> 06:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
um so if you look at page one lines
 
06:40:45.490 --> 06:40:45.500 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
06:40:48.170 --> 06:40:48.180 align:start position:0%
26 and like I guess it goes from lines
 
06:40:50.208 --> 06:40:50.218 align:start position:0%
25 to 27.
 
06:40:52.250 --> 06:40:52.260 align:start position:0%
um if you replace the sentence starting
 
06:40:53.990 --> 06:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
with the fiscal delete shall not be
 
06:40:55.850 --> 06:40:55.860 align:start position:0%
administered by you know and then it
 
06:40:57.048 --> 06:40:57.058 align:start position:0%
continues to another sentence the
 
06:40:58.910 --> 06:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
facility shall be administered by the
 
06:40:59.930 --> 06:40:59.940 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
06:41:03.110 --> 06:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
you could replace those two sentences
 
06:41:05.090 --> 06:41:05.100 align:start position:0%
with something like
 
06:41:08.090 --> 06:41:08.100 align:start position:0%
um that the facility shall be owned and
 
06:41:09.830 --> 06:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
operated by the Department of Health and
 
06:41:12.350 --> 06:41:12.360 align:start position:0%
Human Services with support and shared
 
06:41:14.690 --> 06:41:14.700 align:start position:0%
service contracts as appropriate I think
 
06:41:17.810 --> 06:41:17.820 align:start position:0%
that would address this concept that yes
 
06:41:20.570 --> 06:41:20.580 align:start position:0%
it is appropriate at times to Contract
 
06:41:22.930 --> 06:41:22.940 align:start position:0%
Services I believe that this new center
 
06:41:25.850 --> 06:41:25.860 align:start position:0%
currently contracts Services Clinical
 
06:41:27.410 --> 06:41:27.420 align:start position:0%
Services and I think maybe even some
 
06:41:31.128 --> 06:41:31.138 align:start position:0%
Educational Services when appropriate so
 
06:41:33.708 --> 06:41:33.718 align:start position:0%
um that's that's my pitch would you
 
06:41:36.230 --> 06:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
believe on my bucket list just crossed
 
06:41:39.410 --> 06:41:39.420 align:start position:0%
out is wanting to see a lawyer and an
 
06:41:42.970 --> 06:41:42.980 align:start position:0%
iron worker come to Unity
 
06:41:46.610 --> 06:41:46.620 align:start position:0%
wow yeah I'm glad I could help you out
 
06:41:49.270 --> 06:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:51.470 --> 06:41:51.480 align:start position:0%
lawyers and iron workers we're all
 
06:41:54.230 --> 06:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
playing the worst case scenario game
 
06:41:56.090 --> 06:41:56.100 align:start position:0%
the curse
 
06:41:57.770 --> 06:41:57.780 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to entertain anything I don't
 
06:41:59.690 --> 06:41:59.700 align:start position:0%
know how anybody could top that but if
 
06:42:02.690 --> 06:42:02.700 align:start position:0%
you have a question I bet the uh the
 
06:42:02.700 --> 06:42:03.708 align:start position:0%
you have a question I bet the uh the
lawyer

06:42:03.708 --> 06:42:03.718 align:start position:0%
lawyer
 
06:42:07.788 --> 06:42:07.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:10.310 --> 06:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
what the guy
 
06:42:11.990 --> 06:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
no I'm saying none thank you so much
 
06:42:14.570 --> 06:42:14.580 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:42:14.580 --> 06:42:17.230 align:start position:0%
thank you
foreign

06:42:17.230 --> 06:42:17.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:20.448 --> 06:42:20.458 align:start position:0%
recognizes another lawyer
 
06:42:22.730 --> 06:42:22.740 align:start position:0%
and and a New Jersey
 
06:42:26.810 --> 06:42:26.820 align:start position:0%
born and raised and educated
 
06:42:29.990 --> 06:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:32.090 --> 06:42:32.100 align:start position:0%
Eastern New Jersey
 
06:42:36.170 --> 06:42:36.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:38.810 --> 06:42:38.820 align:start position:0%
answer that question too
 
06:42:42.730 --> 06:42:42.740 align:start position:0%
he is a lawyer and not but a good guy
 
06:42:44.868 --> 06:42:44.878 align:start position:0%
thank you good afternoon everybody Joe
 
06:42:48.110 --> 06:42:48.120 align:start position:0%
ripsom director dcof in fact I I'm sorry
 
06:42:50.090 --> 06:42:50.100 align:start position:0%
to to correct you but I'm actually no
 
06:42:52.128 --> 06:42:52.138 align:start position:0%
longer a lawyer when I moved to New
 
06:42:54.288 --> 06:42:54.298 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and took this job I let my
 
06:42:56.150 --> 06:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
license in New Jersey expire because I
 
06:42:57.590 --> 06:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
wasn't going to be practicing law any
 
06:42:59.868 --> 06:42:59.878 align:start position:0%
longer and there wasn't reciprocity and
 
06:43:01.430 --> 06:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
I didn't feel like taking the bar again
 
06:43:04.548 --> 06:43:04.558 align:start position:0%
so it's not like ordination then no okay
 
06:43:04.558 --> 06:43:06.350 align:start position:0%
so it's not like ordination then no okay
no

06:43:06.350 --> 06:43:06.360 align:start position:0%
no
 
06:43:08.090 --> 06:43:08.100 align:start position:0%
um so it's on suspense my license is on
 
06:43:09.890 --> 06:43:09.900 align:start position:0%
suspended status in New Jersey and at
 
06:43:10.670 --> 06:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
some point I'm going to have to
 
06:43:12.708 --> 06:43:12.718 align:start position:0%
reconcile that before it before it
 
06:43:14.990 --> 06:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely is you know but I'll cross
 
06:43:17.570 --> 06:43:17.580 align:start position:0%
that bridge some other day so we are
 
06:43:19.548 --> 06:43:19.558 align:start position:0%
here in support of of the Bill of the
 
06:43:19.558 --> 06:43:20.868 align:start position:0%
here in support of of the Bill of the
amendment

06:43:20.868 --> 06:43:20.878 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
06:43:23.150 --> 06:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
um I originally was thinking I'd do a
 
06:43:24.590 --> 06:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
line by line but you guys have had that
 
06:43:26.330 --> 06:43:26.340 align:start position:0%
opportunity already so I don't want to
 
06:43:26.340 --> 06:43:28.190 align:start position:0%
opportunity already so I don't want to
exhaust

06:43:28.190 --> 06:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
exhaust
 
06:43:29.750 --> 06:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
um you know everybody's time any more
 
06:43:31.670 --> 06:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
than necessary
 
06:43:32.810 --> 06:43:32.820 align:start position:0%
um you know a couple just big key
 
06:43:34.310 --> 06:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
components right the first section of
 
06:43:36.708 --> 06:43:36.718 align:start position:0%
the bill really just talks about the
 
06:43:39.048 --> 06:43:39.058 align:start position:0%
facility besides the facility to go cope
 
06:43:40.190 --> 06:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
with the facility there's a little bit
 
06:43:41.868 --> 06:43:41.878 align:start position:0%
of data that I wanted to share which was
 
06:43:43.430 --> 06:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
in the PowerPoint that I shared a couple
 
06:43:45.110 --> 06:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
weeks ago but we didn't make it that far
 
06:43:47.650 --> 06:43:47.660 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to hand this document out
 
06:43:49.970 --> 06:43:49.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:43:49.980 --> 06:43:56.090 align:start position:0%
thank you
so

06:43:56.090 --> 06:43:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:59.208 --> 06:43:59.218 align:start position:0%
this is just data being passed around
 
06:44:02.448 --> 06:44:02.458 align:start position:0%
showing the census of sysc
 
06:44:06.230 --> 06:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
it is the actual daily census which is
 
06:44:08.628 --> 06:44:08.638 align:start position:0%
why you see it jumping around so much
 
06:44:16.430 --> 06:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
from July 1 2016 through January 1 2023
 
06:44:19.610 --> 06:44:19.620 align:start position:0%
and you do see the actual census back in
 
06:44:22.670 --> 06:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
2016 and 17 sometimes peaking into that
 
06:44:24.530 --> 06:44:24.540 align:start position:0%
mid 70s level
 
06:44:27.048 --> 06:44:27.058 align:start position:0%
and then you see kind of this you know
 
06:44:29.510 --> 06:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
this kind of crash
 
06:44:32.930 --> 06:44:32.940 align:start position:0%
um around like 2019 and 2020 where you
 
06:44:35.270 --> 06:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
start hovering into this kind of 20s 30s
 
06:44:37.548 --> 06:44:37.558 align:start position:0%
and then kind of staying within those
 
06:44:40.250 --> 06:44:40.260 align:start position:0%
teens from that point that was around
 
06:44:41.510 --> 06:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
the time that two different things
 
06:44:43.970 --> 06:44:43.980 align:start position:0%
happened one the Advent of the
 
06:44:45.590 --> 06:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
children's system of care
 
06:44:49.010 --> 06:44:49.020 align:start position:0%
and two changes in law around who could
 
06:44:51.410 --> 06:44:51.420 align:start position:0%
be detained and committed at sysc so
 
06:44:52.970 --> 06:44:52.980 align:start position:0%
those two things kind of happened at the
 
06:44:54.470 --> 06:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
same time around then and that's really
 
06:44:57.470 --> 06:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
when the census of sysc dropped to what
 
06:45:00.110 --> 06:45:00.120 align:start position:0%
it is that we see today which on average
 
06:45:03.048 --> 06:45:03.058 align:start position:0%
is 12 but on any given day could be as
 
06:45:07.128 --> 06:45:07.138 align:start position:0%
low as five and as of two days ago for
 
06:45:09.770 --> 06:45:09.780 align:start position:0%
the first time in two years actually did
 
06:45:13.128 --> 06:45:13.138 align:start position:0%
get up to 18 for two days before two
 
06:45:15.830 --> 06:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
days ago the highest we had seen was 17
 
06:45:19.310 --> 06:45:19.320 align:start position:0%
for for a few days but so the census can
 
06:45:21.110 --> 06:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
get and it was as low as five in
 
06:45:23.330 --> 06:45:23.340 align:start position:0%
November right so the census can move
 
06:45:25.910 --> 06:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly pretty you know and
 
06:45:27.470 --> 06:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
pretty you know dynamically between
 
06:45:30.110 --> 06:45:30.120 align:start position:0%
those numbers but it hasn't exceeded
 
06:45:34.730 --> 06:45:34.740 align:start position:0%
that number of 18 since early 2020 and
 
06:45:37.490 --> 06:45:37.500 align:start position:0%
that's kind of what we're banking on the
 
06:45:40.430 --> 06:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
um really next portion of this bill goes
 
06:45:42.288 --> 06:45:42.298 align:start position:0%
into kind of what we're talking about in
 
06:45:45.530 --> 06:45:45.540 align:start position:0%
terms of what we want the facility does
 
06:45:48.230 --> 06:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
designed to look like and what we want
 
06:45:50.750 --> 06:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
um you know the the facility itself
 
06:45:52.910 --> 06:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
physically to have right both in terms
 
06:45:54.830 --> 06:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
of the number of kids that it can serve
 
06:45:56.810 --> 06:45:56.820 align:start position:0%
but also you know that we need
 
06:45:58.730 --> 06:45:58.740 align:start position:0%
visibility for staff that's one way that
 
06:46:00.470 --> 06:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
you're able to kind of
 
06:46:02.090 --> 06:46:02.100 align:start position:0%
um be a little more efficient with your
 
06:46:03.708 --> 06:46:03.718 align:start position:0%
Staffing patterns is ensuring visibility
 
06:46:05.510 --> 06:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
one of the challenges of working within
 
06:46:08.448 --> 06:46:08.458 align:start position:0%
144 bed facility that's spread out quite
 
06:46:11.030 --> 06:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
far is you have poor visibility and
 
06:46:12.410 --> 06:46:12.420 align:start position:0%
therefore you have to have sometimes
 
06:46:13.788 --> 06:46:13.798 align:start position:0%
depending on how you're Staffing and
 
06:46:15.830 --> 06:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
your youth are structured more people in
 
06:46:17.750 --> 06:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
the building to spread out than you
 
06:46:19.128 --> 06:46:19.138 align:start position:0%
would if you were in a space that you
 
06:46:20.690 --> 06:46:20.700 align:start position:0%
have better visibility in kind of Staff
 
06:46:23.530 --> 06:46:23.540 align:start position:0%
within a and youth within a closer space
 
06:46:25.910 --> 06:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
talking about having you know just
 
06:46:27.530 --> 06:46:27.540 align:start position:0%
things for medical physical Behavior
 
06:46:29.990 --> 06:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
Health Care needs flexibility in space
 
06:46:33.110 --> 06:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
so we're talking about 18 beds it's not
 
06:46:34.850 --> 06:46:34.860 align:start position:0%
that we anticipate having 18 kids there
 
06:46:36.288 --> 06:46:36.298 align:start position:0%
typically as I said we're typically
 
06:46:39.350 --> 06:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
looking at an average of 12 but we often
 
06:46:40.850 --> 06:46:40.860 align:start position:0%
have kids that need to be separated for
 
06:46:42.410 --> 06:46:42.420 align:start position:0%
different reasons right so it could be
 
06:46:43.910 --> 06:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
separated because you might have male
 
06:46:45.590 --> 06:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
Youth female youth that you don't want
 
06:46:46.730 --> 06:46:46.740 align:start position:0%
to have them sleeping in the same
 
06:46:49.730 --> 06:46:49.740 align:start position:0%
quarters you may also have youth who
 
06:46:50.810 --> 06:46:50.820 align:start position:0%
can't be sleeping in the same quarters
 
06:46:52.310 --> 06:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
because they have court orders that say
 
06:46:53.448 --> 06:46:53.458 align:start position:0%
that these youth have to be separated
 
06:46:54.650 --> 06:46:54.660 align:start position:0%
because maybe they committed common
 
06:46:56.930 --> 06:46:56.940 align:start position:0%
offenses or maybe they have
 
06:46:56.940 --> 06:46:57.948 align:start position:0%
offenses or maybe they have
um

06:46:57.948 --> 06:46:57.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:46:59.930 --> 06:46:59.940 align:start position:0%
um you know maybe they're involved in
 
06:47:01.610 --> 06:47:01.620 align:start position:0%
activities outside or inside the
 
06:47:02.810 --> 06:47:02.820 align:start position:0%
facility that are dangerous to one
 
06:47:04.548 --> 06:47:04.558 align:start position:0%
another sometimes we have kids that are
 
06:47:05.990 --> 06:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
relatively aggressive and kind of pick
 
06:47:08.208 --> 06:47:08.218 align:start position:0%
on other kids who are a little more less
 
06:47:09.948 --> 06:47:09.958 align:start position:0%
you know or a little more vulnerable to
 
06:47:11.270 --> 06:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
those types of situations so we have to
 
06:47:13.850 --> 06:47:13.860 align:start position:0%
separate them so you need to have some
 
06:47:15.410 --> 06:47:15.420 align:start position:0%
space to separate kids even if you're
 
06:47:17.510 --> 06:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
not maximizing every single bed every
 
06:47:20.208 --> 06:47:20.218 align:start position:0%
single night and I do anticipate that we
 
06:47:21.830 --> 06:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
won't be maximizing every bit every
 
06:47:23.448 --> 06:47:23.458 align:start position:0%
night but we still need to have that
 
06:47:23.458 --> 06:47:24.890 align:start position:0%
night but we still need to have that
space

06:47:24.890 --> 06:47:24.900 align:start position:0%
space
 
06:47:25.910 --> 06:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that we've been
 
06:47:27.468 --> 06:47:27.478 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
06:47:30.110 --> 06:47:30.120 align:start position:0%
um with potential Architects is the idea
 
06:47:31.730 --> 06:47:31.740 align:start position:0%
too of being able to have some flexible
 
06:47:35.390 --> 06:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
wall movement in order to move unit size
 
06:47:37.910 --> 06:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
around right so for example you know
 
06:47:40.788 --> 06:47:40.798 align:start position:0%
most nights we only have for the past
 
06:47:42.770 --> 06:47:42.780 align:start position:0%
year we've only had one female in the
 
06:47:44.570 --> 06:47:44.580 align:start position:0%
building at a time now they integrate
 
06:47:47.208 --> 06:47:47.218 align:start position:0%
for programming but for sleeping they're
 
06:47:49.490 --> 06:47:49.500 align:start position:0%
alone but if you have one female at a
 
06:47:51.170 --> 06:47:51.180 align:start position:0%
time and you have say a five bed female
 
06:47:53.690 --> 06:47:53.700 align:start position:0%
unit that that cuts off a lot of other
 
06:47:53.700 --> 06:47:55.368 align:start position:0%
unit that that cuts off a lot of other
beds

06:47:55.368 --> 06:47:55.378 align:start position:0%
beds
 
06:47:57.048 --> 06:47:57.058 align:start position:0%
um and if you end up with say 14 boys
 
06:47:59.208 --> 06:47:59.218 align:start position:0%
one night you're you're in trouble
 
06:47:59.218 --> 06:48:00.770 align:start position:0%
one night you're you're in trouble
so

06:48:00.770 --> 06:48:00.780 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:48:01.850 --> 06:48:01.860 align:start position:0%
um we've been talking about how do you
 
06:48:03.230 --> 06:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
you know with with potential Architects
 
06:48:04.850 --> 06:48:04.860 align:start position:0%
about how do you mitigate and plan for
 
06:48:06.230 --> 06:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
things like that and be able to make an
 
06:48:09.530 --> 06:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
18-bit facility work for these purposes
 
06:48:09.540 --> 06:48:10.548 align:start position:0%
18-bit facility work for these purposes
um

06:48:10.548 --> 06:48:10.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:48:12.948 --> 06:48:12.958 align:start position:0%
uh key things in here around you know
 
06:48:15.288 --> 06:48:15.298 align:start position:0%
educational space medical space for the
 
06:48:17.810 --> 06:48:17.820 align:start position:0%
kids clinical space for the kids
 
06:48:19.368 --> 06:48:19.378 align:start position:0%
um recreational space this is New
 
06:48:20.690 --> 06:48:20.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we need indoor recreational
 
06:48:22.850 --> 06:48:22.860 align:start position:0%
space because we can't always count on
 
06:48:23.990 --> 06:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
being able to go outside with the kids
 
06:48:26.150 --> 06:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
and we definitely need to keep these
 
06:48:28.368 --> 06:48:28.378 align:start position:0%
young folks active if they're not active
 
06:48:30.590 --> 06:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
you do see that play out in in behaviors
 
06:48:32.448 --> 06:48:32.458 align:start position:0%
and other things like that
 
06:48:34.430 --> 06:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
um the last piece of this the last kind
 
06:48:36.410 --> 06:48:36.420 align:start position:0%
of critical piece of this in terms of
 
06:48:38.868 --> 06:48:38.878 align:start position:0%
the facility itself is the next section
 
06:48:40.490 --> 06:48:40.500 align:start position:0%
of the bill that talks more around the
 
06:48:41.868 --> 06:48:41.878 align:start position:0%
programming of the facility kind of
 
06:48:43.910 --> 06:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
moving more towards this trauma-informed
 
06:48:45.350 --> 06:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
treatment clinically informed
 
06:48:47.868 --> 06:48:47.878 align:start position:0%
programming and critically situating
 
06:48:49.910 --> 06:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
sysc within the broader system of care
 
06:48:52.490 --> 06:48:52.500 align:start position:0%
for children so historically one of the
 
06:48:55.788 --> 06:48:55.798 align:start position:0%
big troubles with sysc and probably the
 
06:48:58.430 --> 06:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
prior YDC has been that it's operated
 
06:49:00.468 --> 06:49:00.478 align:start position:0%
kind of on an island separate and apart
 
06:49:02.270 --> 06:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
from the rest of children's Behavioral
 
06:49:03.830 --> 06:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
Health and frankly there wasn't even a
 
06:49:05.030 --> 06:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
children's Behavioral Health as we spoke
 
06:49:06.410 --> 06:49:06.420 align:start position:0%
about last time that I was here and I
 
06:49:08.390 --> 06:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
think I think you all had the benefit of
 
06:49:10.490 --> 06:49:10.500 align:start position:0%
a of a presentation this morning from
 
06:49:11.930 --> 06:49:11.940 align:start position:0%
our colleagues in children's Behavioral
 
06:49:13.010 --> 06:49:13.020 align:start position:0%
Health so some of the terms that
 
06:49:14.170 --> 06:49:14.180 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards spoke about
 
06:49:16.190 --> 06:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
hopefully were somewhat familiar from
 
06:49:17.948 --> 06:49:17.958 align:start position:0%
that presentation this morning
 
06:49:20.390 --> 06:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
but really situating this within that so
 
06:49:22.610 --> 06:49:22.620 align:start position:0%
that the kids at syc have access to the
 
06:49:24.468 --> 06:49:24.478 align:start position:0%
same exact assessments the the cat
 
06:49:26.270 --> 06:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
assessments they have access to the same
 
06:49:27.770 --> 06:49:27.780 align:start position:0%
Care Management entity so that if they
 
06:49:30.170 --> 06:49:30.180 align:start position:0%
get detained at sysc they're then
 
06:49:32.448 --> 06:49:32.458 align:start position:0%
getting the same Care Management entity
 
06:49:34.910 --> 06:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
fast forward or Trek to work with them
 
06:49:36.530 --> 06:49:36.540 align:start position:0%
on how to discharge and get them back to
 
06:49:37.968 --> 06:49:37.978 align:start position:0%
the community and keeping them safe in
 
06:49:40.190 --> 06:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
the community and doing all of that work
 
06:49:41.990 --> 06:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
to really have them be part of that same
 
06:49:44.628 --> 06:49:44.638 align:start position:0%
integrated system so that kids who end
 
06:49:46.968 --> 06:49:46.978 align:start position:0%
up at sysc end up being part of that
 
06:49:48.530 --> 06:49:48.540 align:start position:0%
broader Behavioral Health Care system to
 
06:49:51.468 --> 06:49:51.478 align:start position:0%
keep them safe and out of a place like
 
06:49:53.990 --> 06:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
sysc for the long term
 
06:49:55.310 --> 06:49:55.320 align:start position:0%
um and a host of other important things
 
06:49:57.110 --> 06:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
in here around kind of programming and
 
06:49:59.208 --> 06:49:59.218 align:start position:0%
planning and things like that
 
06:50:01.910 --> 06:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
um I'll just pause and like I said I
 
06:50:03.048 --> 06:50:03.058 align:start position:0%
don't want to go too deep in too long
 
06:50:04.968 --> 06:50:04.978 align:start position:0%
because you guys have had a lot of that
 
06:50:06.530 --> 06:50:06.540 align:start position:0%
already and I I don't want to waste your
 
06:50:09.170 --> 06:50:09.180 align:start position:0%
time and just take questions as you have
 
06:50:14.690 --> 06:50:14.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:17.030 --> 06:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
how long is this day generally
 
06:50:17.040 --> 06:50:17.990 align:start position:0%
how long is this day generally
for

06:50:17.990 --> 06:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:50:20.270 --> 06:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
some of the kids that I know it it's
 
06:50:23.628 --> 06:50:23.638 align:start position:0%
there's no but generally how long
 
06:50:26.330 --> 06:50:26.340 align:start position:0%
yeah it varies um depending on the
 
06:50:29.570 --> 06:50:29.580 align:start position:0%
circumstance so your typical detention
 
06:50:31.610 --> 06:50:31.620 align:start position:0%
right so you have detained kids which
 
06:50:33.230 --> 06:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
are kids who are pending some type of
 
06:50:35.208 --> 06:50:35.218 align:start position:0%
adjudication right
 
06:50:37.128 --> 06:50:37.138 align:start position:0%
um many detained kids could be there for
 
06:50:38.690 --> 06:50:38.700 align:start position:0%
as short as a matter of days meaning
 
06:50:40.070 --> 06:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
like you know they're picked up some
 
06:50:42.048 --> 06:50:42.058 align:start position:0%
things some they've committed some type
 
06:50:44.270 --> 06:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
of offense after a couple days a court
 
06:50:46.128 --> 06:50:46.138 align:start position:0%
will decide you know what things have
 
06:50:47.330 --> 06:50:47.340 align:start position:0%
cooled down we're gonna let you go home
 
06:50:48.770 --> 06:50:48.780 align:start position:0%
and wait to have you know you'll go to
 
06:50:48.780 --> 06:50:49.910 align:start position:0%
and wait to have you know you'll go to
court

06:50:49.910 --> 06:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
court
 
06:50:52.190 --> 06:50:52.200 align:start position:0%
um and that'll get settled later other
 
06:50:54.350 --> 06:50:54.360 align:start position:0%
times kids will stay in detained for a
 
06:50:55.250 --> 06:50:55.260 align:start position:0%
few weeks while they're waiting for
 
06:50:56.990 --> 06:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
their court date
 
06:50:58.968 --> 06:50:58.978 align:start position:0%
um other times if a child is being
 
06:51:00.708 --> 06:51:00.718 align:start position:0%
charged with a really serious offense
 
06:51:02.868 --> 06:51:02.878 align:start position:0%
and potentially pending adult charges
 
06:51:04.670 --> 06:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
and that's unusual we don't see that
 
06:51:05.930 --> 06:51:05.940 align:start position:0%
happen too often in New Hampshire but
 
06:51:08.150 --> 06:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
something like a murder charge those
 
06:51:09.890 --> 06:51:09.900 align:start position:0%
young people will stay in detained
 
06:51:11.750 --> 06:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
status potentially for years
 
06:51:13.788 --> 06:51:13.798 align:start position:0%
right because those cases if they're
 
06:51:15.890 --> 06:51:15.900 align:start position:0%
pending an adult charge can take
 
06:51:17.208 --> 06:51:17.218 align:start position:0%
they'll go through a certification
 
06:51:18.770 --> 06:51:18.780 align:start position:0%
process and a lot of those they'll be
 
06:51:20.150 --> 06:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
waivers on a lot of those kind of time
 
06:51:21.170 --> 06:51:21.180 align:start position:0%
frames and stuff as they're going
 
06:51:23.090 --> 06:51:23.100 align:start position:0%
through all those processes so those
 
06:51:24.590 --> 06:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
kids could stand there for a very very
 
06:51:25.850 --> 06:51:25.860 align:start position:0%
long time and they're probably our
 
06:51:28.250 --> 06:51:28.260 align:start position:0%
longest stairs by far so then the other
 
06:51:30.048 --> 06:51:30.058 align:start position:0%
piece of it is instead of detained is
 
06:51:31.490 --> 06:51:31.500 align:start position:0%
committed kids who have been adjudicated
 
06:51:34.190 --> 06:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
and they've been sentenced and the way
 
06:51:36.890 --> 06:51:36.900 align:start position:0%
the laws Now read in New Hampshire for
 
06:51:38.810 --> 06:51:38.820 align:start position:0%
most offenses it's only a three-month
 
06:51:41.510 --> 06:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
stay prior to parole
 
06:51:43.670 --> 06:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
um so it's three months and they can
 
06:51:45.170 --> 06:51:45.180 align:start position:0%
actually get out sooner than that if
 
06:51:47.090 --> 06:51:47.100 align:start position:0%
they demonstrate that they're that
 
06:51:49.128 --> 06:51:49.138 align:start position:0%
they're kind of stable and able to kind
 
06:51:51.530 --> 06:51:51.540 align:start position:0%
of step down to a another type of
 
06:51:53.270 --> 06:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
program or facility
 
06:51:54.830 --> 06:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
um and and we have the authority to do
 
06:51:55.910 --> 06:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
what's called an administrative release
 
06:51:57.530 --> 06:51:57.540 align:start position:0%
at that point
 
06:51:59.208 --> 06:51:59.218 align:start position:0%
um if not they go to a parole hearing at
 
06:52:00.890 --> 06:52:00.900 align:start position:0%
three months and the parole board makes
 
06:52:02.208 --> 06:52:02.218 align:start position:0%
a decision as to whether they're ready
 
06:52:04.670 --> 06:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
to step down at that point or not and
 
06:52:06.770 --> 06:52:06.780 align:start position:0%
for more serious offenses it's typically
 
06:52:09.708 --> 06:52:09.718 align:start position:0%
a six month before parole so what you
 
06:52:10.670 --> 06:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
typically see if you're a committed
 
06:52:12.948 --> 06:52:12.958 align:start position:0%
population is more often a three-month
 
06:52:15.650 --> 06:52:15.660 align:start position:0%
but sometimes a six month they're really
 
06:52:17.330 --> 06:52:17.340 align:start position:0%
long stairs like I said to those those
 
06:52:19.128 --> 06:52:19.138 align:start position:0%
really serious offenses pending adult
 
06:52:20.930 --> 06:52:20.940 align:start position:0%
charges and they're pretty rare but they
 
06:52:24.430 --> 06:52:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:26.708 --> 06:52:26.718 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
06:52:29.448 --> 06:52:29.458 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford thank you Mr
 
06:52:29.458 --> 06:52:30.590 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford thank you Mr
chairman

06:52:30.590 --> 06:52:30.600 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
06:52:32.090 --> 06:52:32.100 align:start position:0%
what's it going to cost to run this
 
06:52:33.590 --> 06:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
thing what's finance committee going to
 
06:52:37.250 --> 06:52:37.260 align:start position:0%
get for our number sure so as part of
 
06:52:40.190 --> 06:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
the committee that looked at the closure
 
06:52:43.150 --> 06:52:43.160 align:start position:0%
of sysc about 18 months ago
 
06:52:45.830 --> 06:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
we provided some estimates around the
 
06:52:47.448 --> 06:52:47.458 align:start position:0%
operational cost of the current facility
 
06:52:49.250 --> 06:52:49.260 align:start position:0%
versus what the estimate of what the
 
06:52:51.650 --> 06:52:51.660 align:start position:0%
costs could be of operating a smaller
 
06:52:53.510 --> 06:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
co-located facility and it was you know
 
06:52:55.070 --> 06:52:55.080 align:start position:0%
Savings of around two to three million
 
06:52:57.948 --> 06:52:57.958 align:start position:0%
dollars a year to do that
 
06:53:00.530 --> 06:53:00.540 align:start position:0%
you said savings right yes
 
06:53:04.730 --> 06:53:04.740 align:start position:0%
so if I may go on that would be
 
06:53:08.208 --> 06:53:08.218 align:start position:0%
13 000 down to eleven thousand or not
 
06:53:11.690 --> 06:53:11.700 align:start position:0%
thousand million Millions sysc budget I
 
06:53:13.430 --> 06:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
know people like to save 13 million the
 
06:53:15.530 --> 06:53:15.540 align:start position:0%
actual current syac budget was 10.4
 
06:53:15.540 --> 06:53:16.850 align:start position:0%
actual current syac budget was 10.4
million

06:53:16.850 --> 06:53:16.860 align:start position:0%
million
 
06:53:18.708 --> 06:53:18.718 align:start position:0%
why do I like to do that
 
06:53:20.150 --> 06:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
because that's what it was the last
 
06:53:23.208 --> 06:53:23.218 align:start position:0%
biennium not the current biennium okay
 
06:53:26.448 --> 06:53:26.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:26.458 --> 06:53:29.270 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:53:29.270 --> 06:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:32.810 --> 06:53:32.820 align:start position:0%
okay not when you when you gave me that
 
06:53:35.030 --> 06:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
number does that include the bond
 
06:53:35.040 --> 06:53:36.110 align:start position:0%
number does that include the bond
payments

06:53:36.110 --> 06:53:36.120 align:start position:0%
payments
 
06:53:37.368 --> 06:53:37.378 align:start position:0%
I assume there's going to be Bond
 
06:53:40.968 --> 06:53:40.978 align:start position:0%
payments the bill anticipates that the
 
06:53:42.350 --> 06:53:42.360 align:start position:0%
construction costs will be funded
 
06:53:44.810 --> 06:53:44.820 align:start position:0%
through arpa so there would not be Bond
 
06:53:48.110 --> 06:53:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:50.628 --> 06:53:50.638 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
06:53:52.670 --> 06:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
one more
 
06:53:55.070 --> 06:53:55.080 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot of significant savings
 
06:53:58.610 --> 06:53:58.620 align:start position:0%
going on here I think you know a few
 
06:54:00.708 --> 06:54:00.718 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year over potential
 
06:54:00.718 --> 06:54:02.270 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year over potential
decades

06:54:02.270 --> 06:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
decades
 
06:54:05.208 --> 06:54:05.218 align:start position:0%
is I I you know I think that's
 
06:54:06.830 --> 06:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
significant but
 
06:54:11.690 --> 06:54:11.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:14.090 --> 06:54:14.100 align:start position:0%
thank you you could get a new parking
 
06:54:16.968 --> 06:54:16.978 align:start position:0%
garage for the legislature
 
06:54:19.610 --> 06:54:19.620 align:start position:0%
good idea
 
06:54:22.070 --> 06:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond
 
06:54:24.590 --> 06:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman um and uh thank you
 
06:54:26.208 --> 06:54:26.218 align:start position:0%
director for coming and answering our
 
06:54:26.218 --> 06:54:27.650 align:start position:0%
director for coming and answering our
questions

06:54:27.650 --> 06:54:27.660 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:54:30.708 --> 06:54:30.718 align:start position:0%
um on the question of money uh the bill
 
06:54:34.010 --> 06:54:34.020 align:start position:0%
says 15 million to build this facility
 
06:54:34.020 --> 06:54:35.510 align:start position:0%
says 15 million to build this facility
and

06:54:35.510 --> 06:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:54:38.030 --> 06:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm involved in building school
 
06:54:41.270 --> 06:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
facilities right now and our budget is I
 
06:54:43.670 --> 06:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
don't know 90 100 million dollars right
 
06:54:45.468 --> 06:54:45.478 align:start position:0%
now and we're gonna bust it because we
 
06:54:47.570 --> 06:54:47.580 align:start position:0%
can't get what we need now that's for a
 
06:54:49.430 --> 06:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
significantly larger population but
 
06:54:51.430 --> 06:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
you're going to need a lot of the same
 
06:54:54.948 --> 06:54:54.958 align:start position:0%
uh high cost items like
 
06:54:57.288 --> 06:54:57.298 align:start position:0%
um therapeutic facilities and
 
06:54:59.090 --> 06:54:59.100 align:start position:0%
educational facilities which have
 
06:55:01.788 --> 06:55:01.798 align:start position:0%
specific building codes and flex space
 
06:55:05.330 --> 06:55:05.340 align:start position:0%
and interior gym facilities is 15
 
06:55:07.430 --> 06:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
million dollars like was there a study
 
06:55:09.288 --> 06:55:09.298 align:start position:0%
to come up with that number or did is
 
06:55:12.048 --> 06:55:12.058 align:start position:0%
that like a hopeful number so that was
 
06:55:14.390 --> 06:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
you know so DHHS did not come up with
 
06:55:15.650 --> 06:55:15.660 align:start position:0%
that estimate that was an estimate that
 
06:55:17.390 --> 06:55:17.400 align:start position:0%
was provided by department
 
06:55:19.070 --> 06:55:19.080 align:start position:0%
administration our Department
 
06:55:21.530 --> 06:55:21.540 align:start position:0%
administrative Services Public Works 18
 
06:55:25.548 --> 06:55:25.558 align:start position:0%
months go yeah when the study committee
 
06:55:27.110 --> 06:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
first came together right the study
 
06:55:28.128 --> 06:55:28.138 align:start position:0%
committee the representative Edwards
 
06:55:30.708 --> 06:55:30.718 align:start position:0%
referenced the recent fiscal note does
 
06:55:32.750 --> 06:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
have a higher number attached to it that
 
06:55:34.128 --> 06:55:34.138 align:start position:0%
being said
 
06:55:35.690 --> 06:55:35.700 align:start position:0%
um I think there's there's a lot of
 
06:55:38.270 --> 06:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
unknowns right so and there's some
 
06:55:39.350 --> 06:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
things that would be different depending
 
06:55:41.208 --> 06:55:41.218 align:start position:0%
on where facility is located for example
 
06:55:42.830 --> 06:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
if we were to relocate if we were to
 
06:55:45.530 --> 06:55:45.540 align:start position:0%
build this facility in Manchester at its
 
06:55:46.670 --> 06:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
current site we would need to build a
 
06:55:48.590 --> 06:55:48.600 align:start position:0%
commercial kitchen if we were to build
 
06:55:50.628 --> 06:55:50.638 align:start position:0%
this facility next to an existing
 
06:55:51.890 --> 06:55:51.900 align:start position:0%
facility where we could have the food
 
06:55:53.090 --> 06:55:53.100 align:start position:0%
prepared there and brought over we
 
06:55:54.110 --> 06:55:54.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't need to build a commercial
 
06:55:56.570 --> 06:55:56.580 align:start position:0%
kitchen right there's certain things
 
06:55:58.368 --> 06:55:58.378 align:start position:0%
like that that are going to depend upon
 
06:56:00.048 --> 06:56:00.058 align:start position:0%
where the facility is located that are
 
06:56:01.910 --> 06:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
going to impact the cost of the facility
 
06:56:05.868 --> 06:56:05.878 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of unknowns that being
 
06:56:07.788 --> 06:56:07.798 align:start position:0%
said construction costs and labor costs
 
06:56:09.048 --> 06:56:09.058 align:start position:0%
have definitely gone off since the
 
06:56:11.150 --> 06:56:11.160 align:start position:0%
original estimate was was put out so I
 
06:56:13.368 --> 06:56:13.378 align:start position:0%
think there are yes your point is well
 
06:56:14.810 --> 06:56:14.820 align:start position:0%
taken and at the same time there are
 
06:56:16.730 --> 06:56:16.740 align:start position:0%
other variables that are that are
 
06:56:18.830 --> 06:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
unknown thank you 18 months ago is
 
06:56:23.750 --> 06:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:26.208 --> 06:56:26.218 align:start position:0%
are you waving or do you have a question
 
06:56:28.010 --> 06:56:28.020 align:start position:0%
you have a question okay representative
 
06:56:28.020 --> 06:56:30.048 align:start position:0%
you have a question okay representative
Grossman

06:56:30.048 --> 06:56:30.058 align:start position:0%
Grossman
 
06:56:31.730 --> 06:56:31.740 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
06:56:31.740 --> 06:56:32.990 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
um

06:56:32.990 --> 06:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:56:35.030 --> 06:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
oh I just lost my thought
 
06:56:35.040 --> 06:56:37.730 align:start position:0%
oh I just lost my thought
um

06:56:37.730 --> 06:56:37.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:40.788 --> 06:56:40.798 align:start position:0%
do you believe that even though
 
06:56:43.548 --> 06:56:43.558 align:start position:0%
the cost savings may not be this
 
06:56:47.030 --> 06:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
enormous you know three million
 
06:56:50.208 --> 06:56:50.218 align:start position:0%
do you believe that this will be
 
06:56:54.048 --> 06:56:54.058 align:start position:0%
beneficial not just in dollar amounts
 
06:56:56.448 --> 06:56:56.458 align:start position:0%
but in emotional health behavioral
 
06:57:00.350 --> 06:57:00.360 align:start position:0%
health of the population so that
 
06:57:03.948 --> 06:57:03.958 align:start position:0%
the cost benefit we will reap rewards
 
06:57:05.810 --> 06:57:05.820 align:start position:0%
from it yeah I think there's multiple
 
06:57:07.430 --> 06:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
ways to think about it right I think one
 
06:57:09.530 --> 06:57:09.540 align:start position:0%
right there's just what's the right
 
06:57:11.930 --> 06:57:11.940 align:start position:0%
thing to do for kids right I think from
 
06:57:13.730 --> 06:57:13.740 align:start position:0%
that from that perspective it's there's
 
06:57:15.650 --> 06:57:15.660 align:start position:0%
not even an argument on the other side
 
06:57:17.448 --> 06:57:17.458 align:start position:0%
to be made
 
06:57:19.548 --> 06:57:19.558 align:start position:0%
um from the cost of perspective though I
 
06:57:20.990 --> 06:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
think there are multiple things if you
 
06:57:23.270 --> 06:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
want to just talk dollars and cents
 
06:57:25.730 --> 06:57:25.740 align:start position:0%
um in terms of things like you know the
 
06:57:28.490 --> 06:57:28.500 align:start position:0%
success rate of keeping kids from you
 
06:57:30.410 --> 06:57:30.420 align:start position:0%
know recidivism and ending up in the
 
06:57:32.030 --> 06:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
adult system and being able to actually
 
06:57:34.490 --> 06:57:34.500 align:start position:0%
have productive adult lives
 
06:57:35.990 --> 06:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
um you know a lot of research says that
 
06:57:37.490 --> 06:57:37.500 align:start position:0%
these Correctional modalities of
 
06:57:40.128 --> 06:57:40.138 align:start position:0%
treating kids are not effective
 
06:57:42.650 --> 06:57:42.660 align:start position:0%
um so you know why not try try something
 
06:57:43.850 --> 06:57:43.860 align:start position:0%
a little more better and a little more
 
06:57:46.310 --> 06:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
effective and I uh you know so I think
 
06:57:47.868 --> 06:57:47.878 align:start position:0%
you know from a cost perspective you
 
06:57:50.390 --> 06:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
have that I think you also have like I
 
06:57:53.750 --> 06:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
said the um the reality of a few million
 
06:57:55.670 --> 06:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
dollars a year every year for a long
 
06:57:57.708 --> 06:57:57.718 align:start position:0%
period of time is I think
 
06:58:00.770 --> 06:58:00.780 align:start position:0%
meaningful and will you know exceed the
 
06:58:02.390 --> 06:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
cost of the actual building of the new
 
06:58:05.030 --> 06:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
facility in a number of years as well as
 
06:58:06.890 --> 06:58:06.900 align:start position:0%
the value of the property whatever ends
 
06:58:07.968 --> 06:58:07.978 align:start position:0%
up being done with that property which
 
06:58:10.070 --> 06:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
won't be my decision but is something
 
06:58:15.830 --> 06:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:17.270 --> 06:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:58:17.280 --> 06:58:18.830 align:start position:0%
thank you
thank you

06:58:18.830 --> 06:58:18.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:58:23.810 --> 06:58:23.820 align:start position:0%
and this concludes the hearing on House
 
06:58:30.110 --> 06:58:30.120 align:start position:0%
Bill 120 for everyone's purpose we will
 
06:58:33.170 --> 06:58:33.180 align:start position:0%
come back again three o'clock next
 
06:58:33.180 --> 06:58:35.208 align:start position:0%
come back again three o'clock next
Tuesday

06:58:35.208 --> 06:58:35.218 align:start position:0%
Tuesday
 
06:58:37.510 --> 06:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
I have to build that into the calendar
 
06:58:40.628 --> 06:58:40.638 align:start position:0%
so in case we have something
 
06:58:43.070 --> 06:58:43.080 align:start position:0%
to vote on
 
06:58:46.910 --> 06:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
we will be able to and perchance next
 
06:58:48.770 --> 06:58:48.780 align:start position:0%
Tuesday we don't have anything new we'll
