a non- gerain amend amendment to 1150
 
00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:23.479 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1158 let me explain to you
 
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
the way that this came up I'm a member
 
00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:30.280 align:start position:0%
of uh uh jel car uh the administr rules
 
00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:32.840 align:start position:0%
you know sort of oversight committee and
 
00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:36.639 align:start position:0%
during a uh the last proceeding of Jael
 
00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:41.800 align:start position:0%
car an issue came up um about the
 
00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
process of uh the department of safety
 
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
dealing with um people who have a
 
00:06:54.749 --> 00:06:54.759 align:start position:0%
federal license to operate um a a boat
 
00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
or a ship I'm I'm I'm not really into
 
00:06:58.869 --> 00:06:58.879 align:start position:0%
this so I'm gonna I'm G to have somebody
 
00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:01.400 align:start position:0%
who actually knows the details of what
 
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
they're talking about explain in more
 
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
detail but um there there was a a
 
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
question about whether or not the
 
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:13.560 align:start position:0%
department of safety had the authority
 
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
to require somebody who has a federal
 
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
license to operate a boat to take a uh a
 
00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:26.199 align:start position:0%
practical skills for a lack of a better
 
00:07:28.749 --> 00:07:28.759 align:start position:0%
term practical skills test before
 
00:07:31.869 --> 00:07:31.879 align:start position:0%
getting before being allowed to operate
 
00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
um uh in state waters and the department
 
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
of safety apparently is doing that and
 
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:41.960 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me that and I'll let
 
00:07:43.309 --> 00:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
them explain but it seems to me that
 
00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:45.479 align:start position:0%
that that it makes a lot of sense for
 
00:07:47.629 --> 00:07:47.639 align:start position:0%
them to be doing that the problem was
 
00:07:50.749 --> 00:07:50.759 align:start position:0%
that the federal that that our our state
 
00:07:53.589 --> 00:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
statute seems to say if you've got a
 
00:07:55.869 --> 00:07:55.879 align:start position:0%
federal license you you get a state
 
00:07:57.790 --> 00:07:57.800 align:start position:0%
license you don't need this and the
 
00:08:01.469 --> 00:08:01.479 align:start position:0%
state can't do anything anything else um
 
00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:04.120 align:start position:0%
and so the you know the state basically
 
00:08:07.469 --> 00:08:07.479 align:start position:0%
was saying well this this if if that's
 
00:08:09.149 --> 00:08:09.159 align:start position:0%
what the if that's what the state
 
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
statute says that's a problem because we
 
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
think there really is a good reason for
 
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
us to be uh requiring this sort of
 
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
practical uh test and I think most many
 
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:21.720 align:start position:0%
of the people on Jael car agreed that
 
00:08:23.309 --> 00:08:23.319 align:start position:0%
that made that there was good reason for
 
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
them to do that but nonetheless it
 
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
seemed to conflict with the statute and
 
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
so um chairman McGuire of jail car
 
00:08:34.589 --> 00:08:34.599 align:start position:0%
suggested that since I had a bill that
 
00:08:36.509 --> 00:08:36.519 align:start position:0%
was at least somewhat related to this
 
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:37.880 align:start position:0%
that maybe it would make sense to talk
 
00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
about a a a non-g gerain amendment I
 
00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
talked with uh attorney hilz from
 
00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety um who was kind
 
00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
enough to draft something pretty quickly
 
00:08:49.389 --> 00:08:49.399 align:start position:0%
uh and I spoke with the with the chair
 
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:52.200 align:start position:0%
here about that and so as a result you
 
00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
have uh my Amendment 2024
 
00:08:59.910 --> 00:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
87h um
 
00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
and with that I'm happy to take any
 
00:09:03.829 --> 00:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
questions but I think in terms of the
 
00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
details of this you're probably going to
 
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
learn more from attorney hilts or the
 
00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
captain from uh Marine Patrol than you
 
00:09:13.949 --> 00:09:13.959 align:start position:0%
will from me but I'm I'm happy to try to
 
00:09:16.069 --> 00:09:16.079 align:start position:0%
answer any questions if I
 
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:18.760 align:start position:0%
can thank you sir and and for the
 
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
committee I have signed up David hiltz
 
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
from safety who's the attorney of the
 
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
drafted the language and Tim dunlevy
 
00:09:26.949 --> 00:09:26.959 align:start position:0%
also so the questions might be better
 
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
directed towards him any questions for
 
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
for representative Lyn seeing none thank
 
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:33.760 align:start position:0%

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
the bill uh the amendment sorry it's
 
00:10:11.389 --> 00:10:11.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
that good morning um my name is attorney
 
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
Dave hiltz I represent the New Hampshire
 
00:10:18.509 --> 00:10:18.519 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety with me today I
 
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
have Captain uh Tim dunlevy from Marine
 
00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:23.240 align:start position:0%
Patrol uh we're here to testify in
 
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:25.240 align:start position:0%
support of this non- gerain bill and we
 
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:26.920 align:start position:0%
do deeply appreciate this committee's
 
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
willingness to entertain this on short
 
00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
uh such short notice um just to drill
 
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
down a little bit on what representative
 
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:35.800 align:start position:0%
Lynn said um it kind of boils down to we
 
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
had a statute it said two things and um
 
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
as we are going through uh the rules
 
00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:43.880 align:start position:0%
committee on the watercraft safety rules
 
00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:47.160 align:start position:0%
which is the safe C 400 rules it it
 
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
seemed like there was an opportunity to
 
00:10:51.269 --> 00:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
clarify those two points in the statute
 
00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
so the two points being that the um
 
00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:56.720 align:start position:0%
department is authorized to administer
 
00:10:58.990 --> 00:10:59.000 align:start position:0%
an exam for people seeking author
 
00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
ization to operate a a commercial uh
 
00:11:04.829 --> 00:11:04.839 align:start position:0%
boat and the second is what the scope is
 
00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
of any exemption from those examination
 
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
requirements if the person is a holder
 
00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:11.639 align:start position:0%
of a federal license so those are the
 
00:11:14.069 --> 00:11:14.079 align:start position:0%
two things that currently exist in the
 
00:11:16.389 --> 00:11:16.399 align:start position:0%
statute but it seems like it'd be a good
 
00:11:18.829 --> 00:11:18.839 align:start position:0%
idea to clarify those two things so as
 
00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:21.240 align:start position:0%
the representative previously testified
 
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
when the department saw the current
 
00:11:26.509 --> 00:11:26.519 align:start position:0%
authority to administer an examination
 
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
we took that to authorize both both a
 
00:11:32.949 --> 00:11:32.959 align:start position:0%
written exam and practical exam um and
 
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
the captain could speak in Greater
 
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
detail if the um committee were
 
00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:38.360 align:start position:0%
interested but essentially we think that
 
00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
those two parts of the exam are critical
 
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
you know one you did demonstrate the
 
00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
book knowledge you know that you that
 
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
that you need to have to operate a
 
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
commercial vessel but the other is that
 
00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:51.560 align:start position:0%
you can actually demonstrate that you
 
00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
have the skills and the capability to
 
00:11:57.829 --> 00:11:57.839 align:start position:0%
Pilot a commercial boat which the um the
 
00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:00.440 align:start position:0%
amendment would defined as something as
 
00:12:02.829 --> 00:12:02.839 align:start position:0%
34 ft and greater in length to trigger
 
00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:04.760 align:start position:0%
that um practical examination
 
00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
requirement so um it's sort of like the
 
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
difference between if you were in the
 
00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:11.320 align:start position:0%
Navy and you piloted all manner of boats
 
00:12:13.629 --> 00:12:13.639 align:start position:0%
and then when you come out you know you
 
00:12:15.629 --> 00:12:15.639 align:start position:0%
know could you drive the Mount
 
00:12:18.389 --> 00:12:18.399 align:start position:0%
Washington maybe but it's really not the
 
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
same thing as a destroyer or some other
 
00:12:23.069 --> 00:12:23.079 align:start position:0%
you know military craft and so before
 
00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:25.720 align:start position:0%
you know we as the regulating agency
 
00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
would let somebody uh take that step and
 
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
pile it a few hundred people on a uh
 
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:32.240 align:start position:0%
boat like the Mount Washington you need
 
00:12:35.069 --> 00:12:35.079 align:start position:0%
to demonstrate your ability to to Pilot
 
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
that ship um so you know this amendment
 
00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
does two things one it
 
00:12:46.829 --> 00:12:46.839 align:start position:0%
clarifies that the existing examination
 
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
Authority that we have in fact
 
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
authorizes both types a written and a
 
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
practical um and it has the criteria for
 
00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
administering the Practical in the uh in
 
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:00.440 align:start position:0%
the amendment and then also um we
 
00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
clarified the scope of the exemption so
 
00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
that if you did have a federal license
 
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
you know in this subject area that you
 
00:13:10.629 --> 00:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
could be exempt from the uh written
 
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
requirement the written examination but
 
00:13:15.069 --> 00:13:15.079 align:start position:0%
not the Practical because we still feel
 
00:13:18.069 --> 00:13:18.079 align:start position:0%
that it's very important that you know
 
00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:19.880 align:start position:0%
you demonstrate that you can translate
 
00:13:22.509 --> 00:13:22.519 align:start position:0%
any skills that you have so um that's
 
00:13:24.509 --> 00:13:24.519 align:start position:0%
what the amendment does um the
 
00:13:26.189 --> 00:13:26.199 align:start position:0%
department would be deeply appreciative
 
00:13:29.509 --> 00:13:29.519 align:start position:0%
if the committee uh uh passed uh pass
 
00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment and I happy to take your
 
00:13:33.949 --> 00:13:33.959 align:start position:0%
questions or if we'd like to have the
 
00:13:33.959 --> 00:13:37.030 align:start position:0%
questions or if we'd like to have the
captain

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:39.880 align:start position:0%
come I'll do Captain D Levy separate uh
 
00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:41.240 align:start position:0%

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
I'll save my
 
00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:55.480 align:start position:0%
question no I've only got two more
 
00:13:56.829 --> 00:13:56.839 align:start position:0%
people signed up to speak that's from
 
00:13:59.949 --> 00:13:59.959 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety and an organization
 
00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
called Watermark moing construction or
 
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:04.240 align:start position:0%
Marine construction okay can I ask my
 
00:14:07.269 --> 00:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
question now sure okay uh the uh Lakes
 
00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:09.720 align:start position:0%
man management advisory committee was uh
 
00:14:12.749 --> 00:14:12.759 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill because of uh the
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
equity among all the sizes of vessels
 
00:14:18.269 --> 00:14:18.279 align:start position:0%
does is this addressed in the amendment
 
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
is that are they satisfied with
 
00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
this thank you for your question um I
 
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
don't have any knowledge of that not
 
00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
been in touch with anybody from the
 
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
Lakes Region
 
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
um entity that you mentioned um we
 
00:14:36.389 --> 00:14:36.399 align:start position:0%
haven't received any criticism you know
 
00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
either as the department or in the
 
00:14:40.389 --> 00:14:40.399 align:start position:0%
context of being in front of jail car
 
00:14:42.509 --> 00:14:42.519 align:start position:0%
that there's an issue with you know the
 
00:14:45.069 --> 00:14:45.079 align:start position:0%
length of the boats that are captured by
 
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
this um the captain very well may be
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
able to speak to this um so um with your
 
00:14:56.189 --> 00:14:56.199 align:start position:0%
permission I could with his um thank you
 
00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:57.720 align:start position:0%
hold on you'll have another chance at it
 
00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
and and there's another suggestion
 
00:15:00.749 --> 00:15:00.759 align:start position:0%
question too but um we we'll get that in
 
00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
a second anybody else any other
 
00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:05.160 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee ripson
 
00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:08.440 align:start position:0%
sakes thank you Mr chairman thank you uh
 
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
attorney hiltz for taking my question um
 
00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:15.560 align:start position:0%
the thing that I'm struggling with is um
 
00:15:19.069 --> 00:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
in prior testimony for the the original
 
00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
bill that this is being tacked on to
 
00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:24.440 align:start position:0%
there was
 
00:15:27.749 --> 00:15:27.759 align:start position:0%
this concern over how do you define a
 
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
commercial vehicle
 
00:15:32.309 --> 00:15:32.319 align:start position:0%
and I I see all of
 
00:15:32.319 --> 00:15:33.829 align:start position:0%
and I I see all of
this

00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:37.480 align:start position:0%
fine um will this
 
00:15:41.629 --> 00:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
cover the point of
 
00:15:41.639 --> 00:15:43.230 align:start position:0%
cover the point of
the

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:43.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:46.720 align:start position:0%
small as the original bill called you
 
00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:47.590 align:start position:0%
small as the original bill called you
know

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
for uh very small vessels that they
 
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
don't get more than $5,000 worth of
 
00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.150 align:start position:0%
don't get more than $5,000 worth of
whatever

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
and if you if you know if you do these
 
00:15:59.949 --> 00:15:59.959 align:start position:0%
two meld I guess is is the easiest way
 
00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:01.480 align:start position:0%
and ask the question because I want to
 
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
make sure we're F not adding this and
 
00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
creating a further problem for the
 
00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.230 align:start position:0%
creating a further problem for the
original

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:08.240 align:start position:0%
original
 
00:16:10.309 --> 00:16:10.319 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you very much for your
 
00:16:12.309 --> 00:16:12.319 align:start position:0%
question I I have the feeling that the
 
00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
answer to this is going to be a little
 
00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
bit of a team effort um just because of
 
00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
my participation in this has me thinking
 
00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:21.160 align:start position:0%
that I have a little bit of information
 
00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:23.480 align:start position:0%
on that the captain probably does and
 
00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
and I actually think the representative
 
00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:29.240 align:start position:0%
does too but maybe he left um but but
 
00:16:32.509 --> 00:16:32.519 align:start position:0%
the way that I understand it um is that
 
00:16:36.309 --> 00:16:36.319 align:start position:0%
the the original intent of the bill uh
 
00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:38.920 align:start position:0%
is essentially an exemption you know
 
00:16:42.389 --> 00:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
it's an exemption from being required to
 
00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:46.120 align:start position:0%
obtain certification to operate a a boat
 
00:16:46.949 --> 00:16:46.959 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:50.720 align:start position:0%
commercially um and I really don't see
 
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:54.440 align:start position:0%
any reason why there should be any uh
 
00:16:57.629 --> 00:16:57.639 align:start position:0%
conflict between accomplishing that via
 
00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
that language but yet on this on this
 
00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:02.360 align:start position:0%
amendment here this non- gerain
 
00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
amendment we're clarifying what the
 
00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:07.079 align:start position:0%
nature of the examination is for those
 
00:17:09.949 --> 00:17:09.959 align:start position:0%
who must take it you know what I mean so
 
00:17:12.429 --> 00:17:12.439 align:start position:0%
it's like if the if you decide to pass
 
00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:15.919 align:start position:0%
an exemption um that has to do with you
 
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
know a very small length of of the of a
 
00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:20.360 align:start position:0%
boat you know much smaller than the 34
 
00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:22.760 align:start position:0%
feet that this amendment would require
 
00:17:24.909 --> 00:17:24.919 align:start position:0%
and the activities are restricted to
 
00:17:26.789 --> 00:17:26.799 align:start position:0%
certain things you know the prepackaged
 
00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
foods and you know the other asset ects
 
00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:31.400 align:start position:0%
of that exemption then that exemption
 
00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:34.120 align:start position:0%
will be there and those people because
 
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
of the language of the exemption won't
 
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
have to take an exam so it really
 
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter that this amendment
 
00:17:42.669 --> 00:17:42.679 align:start position:0%
defines the nature of the exam if you're
 
00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:45.160 align:start position:0%
required to take it um that's sort of
 
00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
the way I that I see it I hope that I
 
00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
question okay thank you we I'm sure
 
00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
we'll hear some follow-up information
 
00:17:55.549 --> 00:17:55.559 align:start position:0%
from the good
 
00:17:59.549 --> 00:17:59.559 align:start position:0%
Captain OB up Landon thank you Mr chair
 
00:18:02.669 --> 00:18:02.679 align:start position:0%
thank you m um this is obviously for
 
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:05.320 align:start position:0%
vessels registered in New Hampshire
 
00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:07.640 align:start position:0%
saltwater and fresh water so my question
 
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
is to your knowledge to does the state
 
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
of Maine and Massachusetts have similar
 
00:18:16.029 --> 00:18:16.039 align:start position:0%
legislation regarding boats of this size
 
00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:19.919 align:start position:0%
and tests as were outlined here in this
 
00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:21.880 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you for your question
 
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not able to answer that question
 
00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:24.760 align:start position:0%
maybe that's something that the captain
 
00:18:25.909 --> 00:18:25.919 align:start position:0%
could weigh
 
00:18:29.149 --> 00:18:29.159 align:start position:0%
on thank you
 
00:18:31.909 --> 00:18:31.919 align:start position:0%
any other questions seeing none thanks
 
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
very much thank you
 
00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:38.360 align:start position:0%
um going to shake things up a little bit
 
00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
here um Chair recogniz say Paul a good
 
00:18:45.029 --> 00:18:45.039 align:start position:0%
one uh Watermark Marine construction is
 
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:59.470 --> 00:18:59.480 align:start position:0%
suggestions for the record my name is
 
00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:01.240 align:start position:0%
Paul Goodwin I own and operate Watermark
 
00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:03.720 align:start position:0%
Marine construction um little background
 
00:19:05.789 --> 00:19:05.799 align:start position:0%
I uh I've been doing this a long time
 
00:19:07.549 --> 00:19:07.559 align:start position:0%
couple more years than Captain dun Ley
 
00:19:11.149 --> 00:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
but not by much um and uh I've had a
 
00:19:12.669 --> 00:19:12.679 align:start position:0%
commercial boat license in New Hampshire
 
00:19:15.669 --> 00:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
for 40 years give or take a little bit
 
00:19:18.029 --> 00:19:18.039 align:start position:0%
um we operate barges and boats and we
 
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
build docks break Waters boat houses and
 
00:19:22.549 --> 00:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
things like that um relatively involved
 
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
in the lake I was on the wetlands
 
00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
Council for quite a while I was on the
 
00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
Lakes management advisory committee for
 
00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:29.000 align:start position:0%
quite a while
 
00:19:31.549 --> 00:19:31.559 align:start position:0%
um and I would probably guess that I
 
00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:33.320 align:start position:0%
have more time on Lon basaki than
 
00:19:35.149 --> 00:19:35.159 align:start position:0%
anybody working in the industry right
 
00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:37.640 align:start position:0%
now um like I said I've had a commercial
 
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
boat license for all that time and I
 
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
have never been asked to take a
 
00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:44.200 align:start position:0%
practical test so I don't believe that
 
00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:46.520 align:start position:0%
requirement at least in my lifetime has
 
00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:48.760 align:start position:0%
ever come to fruition because I don't
 
00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:50.200 align:start position:0%
know of any none of my guys have ever
 
00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:52.760 align:start position:0%
taken a practical test we all everybody
 
00:19:54.909 --> 00:19:54.919 align:start position:0%
that Ops ores a vessel obviously has a
 
00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:56.440 align:start position:0%
commercial bull
 
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
license um we we have about 30 people
 
00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
and we operate a bunch of workboats a
 
00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:04.120 align:start position:0%
workboat is very similar to driving a
 
00:20:05.669 --> 00:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
just a pleasure boat so there's not a
 
00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:08.200 align:start position:0%
big skill set difference there um but
 
00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:10.120 align:start position:0%
our barges and things are quite
 
00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
different and unique so we're pushing
 
00:20:14.549 --> 00:20:14.559 align:start position:0%
barges with uh smaller vessels called
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
pushbots or or tugboats and uh it's
 
00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:19.480 align:start position:0%
quite a skill set to to operate those
 
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
and so we answer to OSHA and our
 
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
insurance company more than we answered
 
00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:25.400 align:start position:0%
anybody else quite honestly that's
 
00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:27.320 align:start position:0%
pretty true in the construction industry
 
00:20:30.789 --> 00:20:30.799 align:start position:0%
overall but in-house we train our people
 
00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
to drive the boats we don't rely on
 
00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
anybody else and I don't know that
 
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
there's anybody at Marine Patrol that's
 
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
familiar with that type of operation of
 
00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:39.470 align:start position:0%
familiar with that type of operation of
a

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
boat um as I said we've all passed the
 
00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:44.600 align:start position:0%
commercial vat test the written test
 
00:20:46.149 --> 00:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
which I think could have a better study
 
00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
guide but it's a difficult test and
 
00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:50.120 align:start position:0%
there's a note here about a local
 
00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
website Who Says how difficult it is um
 
00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:56.840 align:start position:0%
but uh it it's not easy you do have to
 
00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
understand what's going on
 
00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
this this seems to change things quite a
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
bit by adding the Practical exam um and
 
00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
I have a few questions on that but I I
 
00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
don't understand where the 34 feet came
 
00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
from um seems like an interesting number
 
00:21:11.669 --> 00:21:11.679 align:start position:0%
but um like I said the smaller boats are
 
00:21:13.029 --> 00:21:13.039 align:start position:0%
just like driving a pleasure boat it's
 
00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
not really a big deal but um please
 
00:21:17.269 --> 00:21:17.279 align:start position:0%
understand the US Coast Guard does not
 
00:21:20.029 --> 00:21:20.039 align:start position:0%
require practical exam um same thing you
 
00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
may have OSHA and you may have very
 
00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
strict insurance regulations if you're a
 
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
tug tugboat captain or a tanker captain
 
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
or something like that but the whole the
 
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
whole postard licensing procedures based
 
00:21:32.149 --> 00:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
on your experience and you have to prove
 
00:21:33.909 --> 00:21:33.919 align:start position:0%
that experience you get affidavits from
 
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
people you get recommendations there's
 
00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
so many days that see you have to have
 
00:21:41.149 --> 00:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
um and uh it's it's not an easy license
 
00:21:44.549 --> 00:21:44.559 align:start position:0%
to get um so you're wonder what if if
 
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
the Coast Guard doesn't require it how
 
00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
how would the trainers be trained what
 
00:21:50.909 --> 00:21:50.919 align:start position:0%
would the standards be for that testing
 
00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
I mean we need to know all that as a
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
business ahead of time before we send
 
00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
somebody over for a practical exam uh
 
00:21:58.750 --> 00:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
I'm a pivate pilot and I'm I'm also a
 
00:22:01.149 --> 00:22:01.159 align:start position:0%
tractor trailer driver Class A do
 
00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
license and you you get your license
 
00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
based on what you're doing so for
 
00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:07.240 align:start position:0%
example I'm a single engine land plane
 
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
pilot but you might be a single engine C
 
00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
plane pilot you might be a rotorcraft or
 
00:22:12.549 --> 00:22:12.559 align:start position:0%
helicopter pilot you might be a twin
 
00:22:14.029 --> 00:22:14.039 align:start position:0%
engine pilot you might be a commercial
 
00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
pilot dot tractor trailer is my license
 
00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:19.480 align:start position:0%
it's Class A Class B depends on the
 
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:21.320 align:start position:0%
weights of the vehicle so now we get
 
00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
into I don't know if there will be
 
00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
different testing standards for
 
00:22:27.149 --> 00:22:27.159 align:start position:0%
different vessels especially as it comes
 
00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
to the practice iCal side of the exam um
 
00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
that that would be an interesting
 
00:22:34.669 --> 00:22:34.679 align:start position:0%
question um and also we have a lot of
 
00:22:36.269 --> 00:22:36.279 align:start position:0%
vessels I I don't know how many boats we
 
00:22:37.789 --> 00:22:37.799 align:start position:0%
have I've lost track but maybe we have
 
00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:41.640 align:start position:0%
30 boats um maybe 40 um only a couple of
 
00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:43.480 align:start position:0%
them are over 34 feet because as I said
 
00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:45.080 align:start position:0%
we're operating tug boats and push boats
 
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
that tend to be smaller pushing a barge
 
00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:49.400 align:start position:0%
um but would we have to take multiple
 
00:22:51.269 --> 00:22:51.279 align:start position:0%
tests and get multiple practical
 
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
practical exams from multiple vessels um
 
00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
that would that might be completely
 
00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
different in how they're operated if
 
00:22:58.190 --> 00:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
you're operating a commercial commercial
 
00:23:00.669 --> 00:23:00.679 align:start position:0%
sailboat is much different than bringing
 
00:23:02.269 --> 00:23:02.279 align:start position:0%
a tanker into Portsmouth Harbor or
 
00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:04.520 align:start position:0%
something like that so um I think that
 
00:23:05.789 --> 00:23:05.799 align:start position:0%
that needs some
 
00:23:05.799 --> 00:23:09.310 align:start position:0%
that needs some
work

00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:09.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:12.669 --> 00:23:12.679 align:start position:0%
um the the communication I've had with
 
00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
Captain Dunley seems to lead me to
 
00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:15.880 align:start position:0%
believe that this is mostly being driven
 
00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
by Passenger vessels so the suggestion I
 
00:23:21.269 --> 00:23:21.279 align:start position:0%
have is perhaps adding that caveat that
 
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
you need to be show Proficiency in
 
00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:26.120 align:start position:0%
driving a passenger vessel uh as far as
 
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
the Practical exam goes um noting again
 
00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:30.200 align:start position:0%
that the Coast Guard don't believe Maine
 
00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
or or Massachusetts require I don't know
 
00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
if any state that requires practic those
 
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
S um but I don't pretend to know all the
 
00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:38.840 align:start position:0%
states by any means um you know our
 
00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
barges operate between five and 10 knots
 
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
so you've got plenty of time to react to
 
00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
something going on it's not we're not
 
00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
going fast we tend tend to be heavy and
 
00:23:50.549 --> 00:23:50.559 align:start position:0%
slow um so I think that perhaps
 
00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
specifying that passenger vessels are
 
00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
where we're concerned about public
 
00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:56.360 align:start position:0%
safety and and a practical exam uh
 
00:23:58.190 --> 00:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
secondly because the Coast Guard is
 
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
based on experience I'd suggest adding
 
00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
some sort of a grandfathering clause I
 
00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
mean here I am 40 years in doing this
 
00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
probably nobody has my experience and
 
00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
I'm GNA have to take a test to prove I
 
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
know how to drive something that I do
 
00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:11.200 align:start position:0%
every day you know when the ice is not
 
00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
frozen so I just think there may be a
 
00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:15.320 align:start position:0%
way to add a petition or something like
 
00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:17.000 align:start position:0%
that or some sort of experience where
 
00:24:18.909 --> 00:24:18.919 align:start position:0%
you could get a waiver on that based on
 
00:24:19.909 --> 00:24:19.919 align:start position:0%
how long you've been doing it and I
 
00:24:21.909 --> 00:24:21.919 align:start position:0%
suggest the the window of a commercial
 
00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
boat license is five years so if you've
 
00:24:25.269 --> 00:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
had your license for five years maybe
 
00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
you could be grandfathered to not have
 
00:24:30.549 --> 00:24:30.559 align:start position:0%
to take a practical test um and then I
 
00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
will add one other thing because I do
 
00:24:34.029 --> 00:24:34.039 align:start position:0%
not have a US Coast Guard license I
 
00:24:36.549 --> 00:24:36.559 align:start position:0%
don't need one but the way this reads to
 
00:24:38.669 --> 00:24:38.679 align:start position:0%
me uh in the second section where it
 
00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:41.080 align:start position:0%
says the the license from the federal
 
00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
government you'd be exempt from the
 
00:24:45.389 --> 00:24:45.399 align:start position:0%
written exam it doesn't say exam so that
 
00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:49.480 align:start position:0%
tells me that this might give the Marine
 
00:24:51.269 --> 00:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
Patrol requirement to go down to
 
00:24:53.669 --> 00:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
Portsmith and have a foreign ship
 
00:24:55.389 --> 00:24:55.399 align:start position:0%
captain or tanker or whatever delivering
 
00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
to Portsmith come taken to Hampshire
 
00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
practical exam and I know that I don't
 
00:25:03.269 --> 00:25:03.279 align:start position:0%
believe that's the intent but that's
 
00:25:05.909 --> 00:25:05.919 align:start position:0%
certainly what it says to me as a Layman
 
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
but um the captains of a big ship or the
 
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
captains under the Coast Guard are
 
00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:14.200 align:start position:0%
pretty strictly regulated in experience
 
00:25:16.149 --> 00:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
and medical training fire training
 
00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
safety training and I just don't think
 
00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
there's any reason for the Marine get
 
00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
involved at that level nor do I think
 
00:25:23.389 --> 00:25:23.399 align:start position:0%
they want to but uh Captain Dunley can
 
00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
speak to that um and I've summarized
 
00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
everything in this letter that I handed
 
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
out so thank you thank you very much sir
 
00:25:32.669 --> 00:25:32.679 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
committee represent Coker thank you Mr
 
00:25:38.669 --> 00:25:38.679 align:start position:0%
chair and uh thank you for your time so
 
00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:41.240 align:start position:0%
my understanding is is that literally if
 
00:25:43.549 --> 00:25:43.559 align:start position:0%
it's a US Flagship and your Coast Guard
 
00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:45.720 align:start position:0%
licensed Captain it's kind of almost a
 
00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:47.320 align:start position:0%
self-promoting thing where you just work
 
00:25:50.029 --> 00:25:50.039 align:start position:0%
your way up by vehicle size and
 
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
literally it can go up to like a cruise
 
00:25:53.669 --> 00:25:53.679 align:start position:0%
ship if it was flagged under the US and
 
00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
they would not need a practical exam is
 
00:25:57.269 --> 00:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
that correct is that your understanding
 
00:25:59.230 --> 00:25:59.240 align:start position:0%
of it too it is and um I I didn't
 
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
mention in here about a learner's permit
 
00:26:01.669 --> 00:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
or something like when you're learning
 
00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:03.320 align:start position:0%
to fly you get a student pilot if you're
 
00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:04.520 align:start position:0%
a truck driver you get a learner's
 
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
permit you have to build that experience
 
00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:08.120 align:start position:0%
so the Coast Guard requires basically
 
00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
days at Sea yeah there are separate
 
00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
licenses for say the Mississippi River
 
00:26:13.389 --> 00:26:13.399 align:start position:0%
which is a completely different skill
 
00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
set pushing you know 100 barges at a
 
00:26:18.389 --> 00:26:18.399 align:start position:0%
time so yes it's based on that but those
 
00:26:20.789 --> 00:26:20.799 align:start position:0%
Industries are also very regulated
 
00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
in-house and they are Insurance also is
 
00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:25.640 align:start position:0%
the biggest thank you any other
 
00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:28.240 align:start position:0%
questions representative Hill thank you
 
00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:30.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh and thank you Mr Goodman
 
00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:34.760 align:start position:0%
for taking the time um you are primarily
 
00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
Inland Waters is that um is is there a
 
00:26:41.389 --> 00:26:41.399 align:start position:0%
need do you think to set up different
 
00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
skill sets for Inland versus um Coastal
 
00:26:48.149 --> 00:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
there's probably not a requirement to do
 
00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:50.720 align:start position:0%
it coastally because the requirements of
 
00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
the Coast Guard are I believe it's 26
 
00:26:55.029 --> 00:26:55.039 align:start position:0%
feet um you don't actually need to be a
 
00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
captain but the things I'm talking about
 
00:26:58.029 --> 00:26:58.039 align:start position:0%
are the ships that that come into
 
00:26:59.750 --> 00:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth Harbor those are directly
 
00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:01.240 align:start position:0%
regulated by the Coast Guard and they
 
00:27:02.909 --> 00:27:02.919 align:start position:0%
actively do that so I don't think
 
00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
there's a requirement that this has to
 
00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
have that at all okay I think the
 
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
exemption would be if you have that
 
00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:09.320 align:start position:0%
coast guard license you don't need the
 
00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:10.070 align:start position:0%
coast guard license you don't need the
new

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
new
 
00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
hampire thank you representative C I was
 
00:27:15.669 --> 00:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
just curious since you mentioned
 
00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:17.640 align:start position:0%
Portsmith does this mean that the
 
00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
various Tugboat operators down there
 
00:27:22.149 --> 00:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
would have to go get a
 
00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
license they'd have to take a practical
 
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
exam in Hampshire the way I read this
 
00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:27.320 align:start position:0%
but they already have to have a coast
 
00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:29.919 align:start position:0%
guard license thank
 
00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:33.080 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
questions represent sellers thank you Mr
 
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
chair so you mentioned days at Sea is
 
00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
that would that be similar to number of
 
00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
hours as far as the be certified so I
 
00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:47.320 align:start position:0%
believe the Coast Guard not 100% on this
 
00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
but I believe a 4H hour day is a day at
 
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
se we get a little bit stuck with a
 
00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:53.240 align:start position:0%
regulation that's very weird called the
 
00:27:55.509 --> 00:27:55.519 align:start position:0%
line so in New England New Hampshire and
 
00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:57.240 align:start position:0%
Maine especially you have to go outside
 
00:27:58.909 --> 00:27:58.919 align:start position:0%
a line line that's drawn from Portland
 
00:28:01.389 --> 00:28:01.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Portland Maine to the cape
 
00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
so I've been out in some pretty scary
 
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
stuff inside that line but the Coast
 
00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
Guard doesn't count that as c y so your
 
00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:08.360 align:start position:0%
Inland license is different than your
 
00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:10.029 align:start position:0%
Inland license is different than your
Coastal

00:28:10.029 --> 00:28:10.039 align:start position:0%
Coastal
 
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
license any other questions seeing none
 
00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you very much
 
00:28:17.789 --> 00:28:17.799 align:start position:0%
and I thought this was going to be easy
 
00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes Captain dun Levy from
 
00:28:24.789 --> 00:28:24.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
welcome good morning Mr chairman
 
00:28:28.509 --> 00:28:28.519 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee Tim
 
00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
Dunley I'm representing the Marine
 
00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:33.320 align:start position:0%
Patrol this morning I come in support of
 
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
this bill and um I will I will
 
00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
anticipate some of the questions uh that
 
00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
may be coming from what I heard a moment
 
00:28:44.149 --> 00:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
ago from the perspective of the length
 
00:28:46.509 --> 00:28:46.519 align:start position:0%
that this vessel that this uh amendment
 
00:28:50.149 --> 00:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
is is directing itself toward uh 34 feet
 
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
the state took a look at the types of
 
00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:55.720 align:start position:0%
vessels that we see that give us concern
 
00:28:57.630 --> 00:28:57.640 align:start position:0%
particularly when it comes to the transp
 
00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:01.240 align:start position:0%
ation of the public um the Mount
 
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
Washington is the obvious example but
 
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
when you look at a lot of what our kids
 
00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:08.120 align:start position:0%
summer camps especially on our larger
 
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
Lakes they're getting uh 40 and 50 foot
 
00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:14.200 align:start position:0%
uh Transportation boats for their kids
 
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
camps where a counselor who's 18 years
 
00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:20.200 align:start position:0%
of age can be transporting 50 kids to
 
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
we's Beach to go up to the arcades let's
 
00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
say um so we took it we took a look at
 
00:29:26.909 --> 00:29:26.919 align:start position:0%
what are the types of vessels that we
 
00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:28.440 align:start position:0%
have the greatest concern with that
 
00:29:30.029 --> 00:29:30.039 align:start position:0%
they're transporting the greatest number
 
00:29:34.669 --> 00:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
of people and 34 ft number one could
 
00:29:37.389 --> 00:29:37.399 align:start position:0%
handle a large much larger capacity and
 
00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
number two often times those vessels
 
00:29:42.389 --> 00:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
were at least twin engine which
 
00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:46.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:50.120 align:start position:0%
operation we are not looking to impact
 
00:29:53.029 --> 00:29:53.039 align:start position:0%
the uh uh the the bill that this is
 
00:29:55.389 --> 00:29:55.399 align:start position:0%
attached to whatsoever that bill is
 
00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
dealing with vessels that are less than
 
00:29:59.710 --> 00:29:59.720 align:start position:0%
16 18 ft in length so we're we're we're
 
00:30:01.509 --> 00:30:01.519 align:start position:0%
not even close to being having any
 
00:30:03.389 --> 00:30:03.399 align:start position:0%
impact on on that original
 
00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
pill uh as far as the Coast Guard is
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
concerned the Coast Guard as you heard
 
00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh from Mr Goodwin has a very
 
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
um involved process to be able to
 
00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
achieve a captain's license whatever
 
00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
tonnage your certification may be you do
 
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
need to demonstrate SE time we do not
 
00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
have that mechanism in place on on New
 
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire land Waters we do not get
 
00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
involved with shipping on our Sea Coast
 
00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
because we recognize the Coast Guard and
 
00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
the federal jurisdiction and the things
 
00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
that a person needs to meet before
 
00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
they're even uh in in the Wheelhouse of
 
00:30:43.789 --> 00:30:43.799 align:start position:0%
a vessel of that size we
 
00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
do um uh license smaller uh uh fishing
 
00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:51.320 align:start position:0%
charges and that sort of thing uh but
 
00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
again we're not talking uh commercial
 
00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
shipping or anything like that nor do we
 
00:30:56.909 --> 00:30:56.919 align:start position:0%
want to get involved with that uh Mr
 
00:30:59.310 --> 00:30:59.320 align:start position:0%
Goodwin statement was very accurate uh
 
00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:02.200 align:start position:0%
when it comes to that so um that's what
 
00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
we're looking to do um certainly any
 
00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
process or any practical exam that that
 
00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:10.559 align:start position:0%
this bill would allow us to do is going
 
00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
to have rulem of its own uh we're just
 
00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
trying to clarify that that person who
 
00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
comes to us with that federal
 
00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
license who maybe if you want to use the
 
00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
airline analogy has operated a
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
commercial airliner all their life
 
00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:28.559 align:start position:0%
retires and all of a sudden wants to
 
00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:30.760 align:start position:0%
start taking people up for SE plane
 
00:31:32.789 --> 00:31:32.799 align:start position:0%
rides we just want to make sure that
 
00:31:34.549 --> 00:31:34.559 align:start position:0%
that person can drive the SE plane yeah
 
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
they can drive the 747 but there are
 
00:31:39.149 --> 00:31:39.159 align:start position:0%
differences and that's the difference we
 
00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
want to make sure when somebody gets to
 
00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
behind the wheel of the Mount Washington
 
00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
or the Thomas not the Thomas Leon but
 
00:31:48.629 --> 00:31:48.639 align:start position:0%
the uh Mount sopy or the Big Bear Camp
 
00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
Sandy Island whatever it might be that
 
00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
while they're transporting those people
 
00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
they can do so safely and are proficient
 
00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to answer any other
 
00:31:59.830 --> 00:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
questions that I may have
 
00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
missed thank you sir representative
 
00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
Crawford thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:07.039 align:start position:0%
for taking my question would this
 
00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:09.240 align:start position:0%
require the department of safety to hire
 
00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:13.240 align:start position:0%
extra people to test all these
 
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
um voters uh no uh right now we're doing
 
00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
it um uh we do about 600 inspections
 
00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
about 600 license exams every year when
 
00:32:26.669 --> 00:32:26.679 align:start position:0%
we look at the the number of people who
 
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
are actually
 
00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:30.200 align:start position:0%
operating vessels at this size
 
00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
particularly uh uh uh passenger vessels
 
00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
we might be looking at a half dozen a
 
00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:42.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
lift representative Coker thank you Mr
 
00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:46.840 align:start position:0%
chair thank you Captain um so the
 
00:32:48.909 --> 00:32:48.919 align:start position:0%
question the the Practical exam is kind
 
00:32:50.629 --> 00:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
of where I have the most questions about
 
00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
because when you go over so I'm I'm an
 
00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
airline pilot and every when I over a
 
00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:57.240 align:start position:0%
certain size I have to get individually
 
00:32:59.350 --> 00:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
typ rated on each airplane that I fly
 
00:33:01.470 --> 00:33:01.480 align:start position:0%
commercially so like when I look at this
 
00:33:04.269 --> 00:33:04.279 align:start position:0%
I go a vehicle that's that's maybe 30 to
 
00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
50 feet you know probably they're going
 
00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:08.360 align:start position:0%
to be similar enough that you know you
 
00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:10.600 align:start position:0%
you probably be able to handle if if
 
00:33:11.909 --> 00:33:11.919 align:start position:0%
you're you can handle one you can
 
00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
probably handle the others but about
 
00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
getting over that like the Mount
 
00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:17.240 align:start position:0%
Washington and the bigger vessels that's
 
00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
where I see maybe more individualized
 
00:33:21.629 --> 00:33:21.639 align:start position:0%
practical test so the the big issue I
 
00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
have is I know it would have to go
 
00:33:25.389 --> 00:33:25.399 align:start position:0%
through the rule making but like the do
 
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
you guys have like a format for a
 
00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
practical exam or thoughts or like what
 
00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
what are you actually like what are you
 
00:33:33.789 --> 00:33:33.799 align:start position:0%
looking for on that practical
 
00:33:36.509 --> 00:33:36.519 align:start position:0%
exam we're looking for first of all that
 
00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
the operator has a demonstrated
 
00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:40.360 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the vessel itself the fire
 
00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
extinguishing systems things that an
 
00:33:44.269 --> 00:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
emergency situation would require them
 
00:33:47.549 --> 00:33:47.559 align:start position:0%
to know uh and then we want to see
 
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
anybody can op operate a boat on the
 
00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
open Waters of Lake wiip basaki where
 
00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:55.000 align:start position:0%
where someone's true skill is is is
 
00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
demonstrated is when they are en Tien
 
00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
quarters docking Maneuvers um Close
 
00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
Quarter maneuvering is where we can
 
00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
really tell whether they have a handle
 
00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:06.440 align:start position:0%
on that vessel now open water absolutely
 
00:34:08.349 --> 00:34:08.359 align:start position:0%
you need to know the characteristics of
 
00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
of the vessel how it handles chop and
 
00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
all those things but we're looking at uh
 
00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
seeing a person uh properly deploying an
 
00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
anchor we're not looking for them to
 
00:34:17.629 --> 00:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
deploy the anchor on the Mount
 
00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
Washington but know how um can they
 
00:34:23.869 --> 00:34:23.879 align:start position:0%
bring the boat into the dock in Alton
 
00:34:25.669 --> 00:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
and wolfboro when you've got an East
 
00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
Wind um those are things that we're
 
00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:30.440 align:start position:0%
looking for approaching a buoy making
 
00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
sure that they they have knowledge of
 
00:34:35.109 --> 00:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's uh buoy system it's
 
00:34:37.629 --> 00:34:37.639 align:start position:0%
academic knowledge but do they have that
 
00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
knowledge the ability to read that
 
00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:41.839 align:start position:0%
Compass they come to us with certain
 
00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
licenses and credentials but they've
 
00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
never applied it on New Hampshire's
 
00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
unique navigation system so those are
 
00:34:49.950 --> 00:34:49.960 align:start position:0%
the things we're looking for one more
 
00:34:51.869 --> 00:34:51.879 align:start position:0%
follow real quick yeah follow up thank
 
00:34:55.470 --> 00:34:55.480 align:start position:0%
you chairman um so how would like from
 
00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
just a practical St stand point I would
 
00:34:58.829 --> 00:34:58.839 align:start position:0%
assume like the crew of the Mount
 
00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:00.760 align:start position:0%
Washington would have a a very good
 
00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
working knowledge of the Mount
 
00:35:04.829 --> 00:35:04.839 align:start position:0%
Washington how would the Marine Patrol
 
00:35:06.829 --> 00:35:06.839 align:start position:0%
be able to have a higher level of
 
00:35:08.589 --> 00:35:08.599 align:start position:0%
knowledge to be able to evaluate
 
00:35:10.069 --> 00:35:10.079 align:start position:0%
somebody on on a vehicle on a
 
00:35:11.589 --> 00:35:11.599 align:start position:0%
specialized vehicle like that I mean is
 
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
there or would you guys like contract
 
00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:16.040 align:start position:0%
with somebody who's Captain the Mount
 
00:35:17.589 --> 00:35:17.599 align:start position:0%
Washington to do the Practical test I
 
00:35:19.589 --> 00:35:19.599 align:start position:0%
mean that's those are the details I'm
 
00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:21.400 align:start position:0%
and and and we we've been doing it
 
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
that's why we're here uh it was jail car
 
00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:27.320 align:start position:0%
identified that yeah um we
 
00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:29.240 align:start position:0%
we we communicate with the Mount
 
00:35:32.069 --> 00:35:32.079 align:start position:0%
Washington we jump on the boat when a
 
00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
new person who is ready for their
 
00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
practical exam to be taken is ready um
 
00:35:40.589 --> 00:35:40.599 align:start position:0%
there's a senior captain on board and we
 
00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
go along for the ride we have our
 
00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
checklist uh and and observe them
 
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
bringing the boat along to the dock so
 
00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:48.760 align:start position:0%
this is already somewhat of a process in
 
00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
place it's a process place all right
 
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
Mr representative Hill thank you Mr
 
00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:57.640 align:start position:0%
chairman thank thank you for taking my
 
00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
question if this was specific to
 
00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
passenger carrying vessels would that
 
00:36:05.829 --> 00:36:05.839 align:start position:0%
cause you
 
00:36:05.839 --> 00:36:08.390 align:start position:0%
cause you
heartburn

00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
heartburn
 
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
um you you'd have to look at the
 
00:36:12.309 --> 00:36:12.319 align:start position:0%
definition of a of a commercial vessel
 
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
at that point um and and whether you
 
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
create exemptions certainly uh I would
 
00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
yield to your wisdom um there are people
 
00:36:22.109 --> 00:36:22.119 align:start position:0%
in this room like Mr Goodwin who who
 
00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:25.400 align:start position:0%
have a wealth of experience uh what what
 
00:36:27.309 --> 00:36:27.319 align:start position:0%
other companies do
 
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh bringing someone in to operate a
 
00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
large barge uh are they qualified I I
 
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
can't speak to that but what I can speak
 
00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
to and what he said was certainly yes
 
00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
they are regulated by osher and their
 
00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
insurance companies if they carry
 
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
Insurance um and the exposure to the
 
00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:47.720 align:start position:0%
public certainly is not that of of a a
 
00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
passenger carrying vessel thank
 
00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:54.040 align:start position:0%
you I just have one question we have two
 
00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
people here with a tremendous amount of
 
00:36:58.630 --> 00:36:58.640 align:start position:0%
experience Lake on Lake wab
 
00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:01.960 align:start position:0%
basaki um you're telling me or telling
 
00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:03.839 align:start position:0%
us that this is a process you actually
 
00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
already do we just need a codified and
 
00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:09.839 align:start position:0%
statute as identified and then we have
 
00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:12.920 align:start position:0%
somebody else saying that if this passes
 
00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
it's going to negatively and adversely
 
00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:19.240 align:start position:0%
affect them I just don't know uh where
 
00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:20.920 align:start position:0%
where this is going can you help me with
 
00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:21.710 align:start position:0%
where this is going can you help me with
that

00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:21.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:25.589 align:start position:0%
that
one

00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:29.829 --> 00:37:29.839 align:start position:0%
um Mr Goodwin uh one runs probably the
 
00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:31.400 align:start position:0%
most reputable Marine construction
 
00:37:34.309 --> 00:37:34.319 align:start position:0%
company uh around there are others like
 
00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
him that do different things but with
 
00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
with equal reputation that being said um
 
00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
what as a whole in his industry people
 
00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:48.839 align:start position:0%
operating large barges are they
 
00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
qualified uh that would be my question
 
00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
um he is correct in that they have uh
 
00:37:58.349 --> 00:37:58.359 align:start position:0%
unique push push boats where they're
 
00:37:59.910 --> 00:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
pushing large barges the barge is
 
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
empowered so this isn't even going to be
 
00:38:04.990 --> 00:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
subject to that
 
00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
um I think Al made sound like we're on
 
00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
different pages I I think we're we agree
 
00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
in a lot of sense as to where we need to
 
00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
go no not fair enough thank you I didn't
 
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
mean to put you on the spot
 
00:38:19.109 --> 00:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
representative Gorski thank you Mr
 
00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
question you mentioned that you've been
 
00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
doing this on Lake wiip for for for
 
00:38:28.309 --> 00:38:28.319 align:start position:0%
a while how many of these exams do you
 
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
do in a typical year of these practical
 
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
exams uh we do it Beyond wiip uh
 
00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
again it's been uh vessel specific um it
 
00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
varies on on what kind of turnover those
 
00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
those folks are seeing uh within their
 
00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:43.000 align:start position:0%
ranks of their
 
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.829 align:start position:0%
ranks of their
employees

00:38:44.829 --> 00:38:44.839 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:38:48.349 --> 00:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
um we may do a dozen a year and that
 
00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
includes Camp counselors on on on on
 
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
kids camps the camps even recognize
 
00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:55.400 align:start position:0%
they're going to take the veteran
 
00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
counselor that's returning year after
 
00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
year to operate those big boats so uh we
 
00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
don't see a huge turnover uh necessarily
 
00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:07.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:09.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't representative
 
00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
sellers thank you Mr
 
00:39:14.829 --> 00:39:14.839 align:start position:0%
chair would it be better that we maybe
 
00:39:19.109 --> 00:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
tighten this up to say any vessel that's
 
00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:22.040 align:start position:0%
transporting transporting passengers
 
00:39:24.109 --> 00:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
would make more sense for an exam
 
00:39:25.309 --> 00:39:25.319 align:start position:0%
because you're looking for safety at
 
00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
that point that's what I'm wondering
 
00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
I I would yield to your wisdom as a
 
00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
committee um I I don't feel that I'd be
 
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
in the position without uh speaking to
 
00:39:38.829 --> 00:39:38.839 align:start position:0%
my superiors about their position uh on
 
00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:41.960 align:start position:0%
on sticking with just passenger
 
00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
vessels I'll go in the order I saw them
 
00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
represent PL pandon thank you Mr chair
 
00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:49.240 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question U
 
00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
kind of along the lines of the questions
 
00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
of our chairman I just look for more
 
00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
clarification in your earlier statements
 
00:39:58.910 --> 00:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
you stated that the uh Marine uh uh
 
00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
Excursion vessels deep sea and whale
 
00:40:04.270 --> 00:40:04.280 align:start position:0%
watch and so on you do certify them my
 
00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
question is is the certification process
 
00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:09.800 align:start position:0%
in any way similar to the legislation
 
00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:11.960 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at here or how are
 
00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:12.710 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at here or how are
they

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
certified because those are passenger
 
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
vessels they are and indeed uh if if I
 
00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
said something I I misspoke we do not
 
00:40:22.309 --> 00:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
touch commercial operations on our Sea
 
00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:24.040 align:start position:0%
Coast like a whale watch or a commercial
 
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
fishing vessel those fall under the
 
00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
strict regulations of the Coast Guard
 
00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:33.160 align:start position:0%
and like quick followup follow up uh so
 
00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
this legislation would in would affect
 
00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:37.960 align:start position:0%
them as well going if it
 
00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:41.720 align:start position:0%
passed um we have no intention for it to
 
00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:43.480 align:start position:0%
uh if the language being offered does
 
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
that um it's it's not anything we do
 
00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
because we recognize the federal
 
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction uh is more strict uh more
 
00:40:56.309 --> 00:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
experienced um uh their process is sign
 
00:40:58.069 --> 00:40:58.079 align:start position:0%
significantly more
 
00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
involved due to not only the the nature
 
00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
of the environment but the nature of the
 
00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
vessels that they're overseeing thank
 
00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr
 
00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
chair representative Sykes thank you Mr
 
00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Captain for taking my
 
00:41:16.309 --> 00:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
question is there any practical way for
 
00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
the Marine Patrol to differentiate
 
00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
between a vessel that is generally used
 
00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:27.400 align:start position:0%
for commercial purposes but not carry
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
passengers but then might on a one-off
 
00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
situation suddenly turned into a vessel
 
00:41:37.390 --> 00:41:37.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:39.640 align:start position:0%
passengers I suppose that could happen
 
00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:43.960 align:start position:0%
sure um uh anybody could I guess take a
 
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
construction barge and turn it into you
 
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
know uh a fireworks barge or take people
 
00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:52.640 align:start position:0%
out um obviously there would be an
 
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
investment on their part uh safety
 
00:41:56.589 --> 00:41:56.599 align:start position:0%
equipment wise and that's sort of thing
 
00:41:58.270 --> 00:41:58.280 align:start position:0%
and these vessels aren't necessarily
 
00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
built for for that type of Excursion but
 
00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
I suppose people can get creative and
 
00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:05.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
it that's fine um representative Hill
 
00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:10.200 align:start position:0%
did you still have a
 
00:42:14.589 --> 00:42:14.599 align:start position:0%
question you passed representative C
 
00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:18.200 align:start position:0%
taking the question uh do you have an
 
00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
idea about how much proportion uh are
 
00:42:23.589 --> 00:42:23.599 align:start position:0%
passenger vessels that you do testing
 
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
I would say
 
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
probably 20% of the overall commercial
 
00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:37.400 align:start position:0%
vessels in our state 15 to 20% are
 
00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
probably Marine construction
 
00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:41.549 align:start position:0%
probably Marine construction
related

00:42:41.549 --> 00:42:41.559 align:start position:0%
related
 
00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
um the bigger question is of of those
 
00:42:46.549 --> 00:42:46.559 align:start position:0%
that are not Marine construction related
 
00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:48.200 align:start position:0%
that are classified as commercial how
 
00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
many of those are over 34 feet and we're
 
00:42:52.829 --> 00:42:52.839 align:start position:0%
probably talking
 
00:42:52.839 --> 00:42:55.150 align:start position:0%
probably talking
about

00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:55.160 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:42:59.349 --> 00:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
high all right seeing no other questions
 
00:43:03.359 --> 00:43:04.230 align:start position:0%
high all right seeing no other questions
thank

00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:07.480 align:start position:0%
you oh representative Fox thank you Mr
 
00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
chair I I have an additional question
 
00:43:12.829 --> 00:43:12.839 align:start position:0%
for Mr Goodwin would that be appropriate
 
00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
at some
 
00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:17.839 align:start position:0%
point thank you if he wants to take it
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
but did would you like to take one more
 
00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:27.309 --> 00:43:27.319 align:start position:0%
dunlevy if we were to change the context
 
00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
of the amendment to uh to be more
 
00:43:33.069 --> 00:43:33.079 align:start position:0%
appropriate to just passenger vessels
 
00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:34.760 align:start position:0%
would that affect your
 
00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
opinion yeah I think that's the intent
 
00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
here is to look at the public safety
 
00:43:42.109 --> 00:43:42.119 align:start position:0%
aspect which is transportation of people
 
00:43:44.109 --> 00:43:44.119 align:start position:0%
yes thank
 
00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:46.760 align:start position:0%
you all right seeing no other questions
 
00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:48.200 align:start position:0%
and nobody else signed up to speak I'm
 
00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
going to close the public hearing on
 
00:43:54.349 --> 00:43:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:57.870 --> 00:43:57.880 align:start position:0%
number 08
 
00:43:59.829 --> 00:43:59.839 align:start position:0%
870 okay so this is going to be an
 
00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:03.400 align:start position:0%
unusual day um hold on to some of your
 
00:44:06.589 --> 00:44:06.599 align:start position:0%
thoughts on this uh I've got the work
 
00:44:08.549 --> 00:44:08.559 align:start position:0%
session on the four bills that we have
 
00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:11.640 align:start position:0%
left four house bills at 10:30 I've
 
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
going to do some scrambling to find a
 
00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:15.880 align:start position:0%
few more amendments that I have not seen
 
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
yet so I may be a couple minutes late um
 
00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
and then uh hopefully we can uh go
 
00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:23.720 align:start position:0%
through the work session if we have any
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
ideas that need changing with OS we'll
 
00:44:30.069 --> 00:44:30.079 align:start position:0%
try to get it done today if it can't get
 
00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
done today I'm leaving us a way out for
 
00:44:35.589 --> 00:44:35.599 align:start position:0%
us I've already been told we have at
 
00:44:38.109 --> 00:44:38.119 align:start position:0%
least five Senate bills coming so this
 
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
won't be our last day after all so so
 
00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:43.000 align:start position:0%
bear with me while I try to get the rest
 
00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
of our amendments together and I'll see
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:54.960 --> 01:17:09.350 align:start position:0%
 
possible

01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:11.350 --> 01:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
okay good morning everybody uh sorry for
 
01:17:14.110 --> 01:17:14.120 align:start position:0%
the delay I'm going to open up our uh
 
01:17:15.709 --> 01:17:15.719 align:start position:0%
full committee work
 
01:17:19.110 --> 01:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
session we did hold on to four bills
 
01:17:20.830 --> 01:17:20.840 align:start position:0%
that we were assigned this year we
 
01:17:23.709 --> 01:17:23.719 align:start position:0%
trying to make them work trying to make
 
01:17:23.719 --> 01:17:24.830 align:start position:0%
trying to make them work trying to make
them

01:17:24.830 --> 01:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:17:28.149 --> 01:17:28.159 align:start position:0%
better um I'm going to start I'm not
 
01:17:29.390 --> 01:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
going to go in order I'm going to start
 
01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
with House Bill
 
01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
1457 which is establishing penalties for
 
01:17:35.790 --> 01:17:35.800 align:start position:0%
driving over covered wooden bridges and
 
01:17:38.189 --> 01:17:38.199 align:start position:0%
vehicles that exceed posted limits for
 
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
vehicular damage to covered wooden
 
01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
bridges the reason I held on to that um
 
01:17:46.470 --> 01:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
the clerk informed me that that should
 
01:17:48.350 --> 01:17:48.360 align:start position:0%
have been a second committee bill or two
 
01:17:49.590 --> 01:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
committee Bill and it should have gone
 
01:17:53.590 --> 01:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
to criminal justice after we decided
 
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
policy um so what he asked me to do was
 
01:17:58.750 --> 01:17:58.760 align:start position:0%
get in touch with the chair of Criminal
 
01:18:01.070 --> 01:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
Justice and give him an opportunity to
 
01:18:02.990 --> 01:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
put in any amendments that he thought
 
01:18:05.350 --> 01:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
they would have done if it was in their
 
01:18:08.110 --> 01:18:08.120 align:start position:0%
committee um he did have a couple of
 
01:18:11.149 --> 01:18:11.159 align:start position:0%
ideas uh but I just did confirm with uh
 
01:18:14.110 --> 01:18:14.120 align:start position:0%
ol that none were actually
 
01:18:17.149 --> 01:18:17.159 align:start position:0%
submitted so that's where we're at that
 
01:18:19.750 --> 01:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
right now and you know what let me get a
 
01:18:22.709 --> 01:18:22.719 align:start position:0%
copy of my bill uh and we'll continue
 
01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:51.920 --> 01:19:56.830 align:start position:0%
 
second

01:19:56.830 --> 01:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:59.390 --> 01:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
okay um I guess we'll go on the
 
01:20:00.910 --> 01:20:00.920 align:start position:0%
Assumption we don't have any amendments
 
01:20:02.709 --> 01:20:02.719 align:start position:0%
from criminal justice but I will tell
 
01:20:05.310 --> 01:20:05.320 align:start position:0%
you one of the ones with the one I do
 
01:20:08.149 --> 01:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
remember that he thought was a potential
 
01:20:09.910 --> 01:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
and I'll ask and see if you think it
 
01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
needs to go anywhere he was concerned
 
01:20:14.790 --> 01:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
with the increase in the fines maybe we
 
01:20:17.189 --> 01:20:17.199 align:start position:0%
should amend this to specify that the
 
01:20:18.830 --> 01:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
fines collected
 
01:20:22.110 --> 01:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
from uh violation of the wooden covered
 
01:20:24.350 --> 01:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
bridges would pay for the maintenance of
 
01:20:26.149 --> 01:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
the wooden covered bridges so that it
 
01:20:28.830 --> 01:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't turn into a revenue
 
01:20:31.629 --> 01:20:31.639 align:start position:0%
stream however I did look at the current
 
01:20:33.070 --> 01:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
statute on bridge
 
01:20:35.390 --> 01:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
maintenance and basically they just
 
01:20:38.030 --> 01:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
borrowed what's already in existence in
 
01:20:40.430 --> 01:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
other words yeah you there is no special
 
01:20:42.590 --> 01:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
fund if the if the money is collected
 
01:20:45.350 --> 01:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
for a violation it is there it's not
 
01:20:49.430 --> 01:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
Specialized or particular for any any
 
01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
purpose any thoughts from anybody
 
01:20:53.950 --> 01:20:53.960 align:start position:0%
assuming we have none from the committee
 
01:20:56.229 --> 01:20:56.239 align:start position:0%
I mean from Criminal Justice what how
 
01:20:58.870 --> 01:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
would you like to move forward with 1457
 
01:21:00.910 --> 01:21:00.920 align:start position:0%
we've we've already I believe we're
 
01:21:03.390 --> 01:21:03.400 align:start position:0%
unanimous in support of the policy
 
01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
change so I'm going to leave it up to
 
01:21:07.950 --> 01:21:07.960 align:start position:0%
the discretion of the committee if we
 
01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
would like to look at it anymore or just
 
01:21:13.510 --> 01:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
stick with our policy I'm fine with it
 
01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:18.990 --> 01:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
it represent plon U yeah just a question
 
01:21:22.149 --> 01:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
to you Mr chair at we had had to heard
 
01:21:22.159 --> 01:21:23.310 align:start position:0%
to you Mr chair at we had had to heard
testimony

01:21:23.310 --> 01:21:23.320 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:21:24.950 --> 01:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
that some of these bridges are
 
01:21:26.790 --> 01:21:26.800 align:start position:0%
maintained by the community whereas
 
01:21:29.550 --> 01:21:29.560 align:start position:0%
others a state did we ever identify
 
01:21:31.310 --> 01:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
where these fines would go whether to
 
01:21:33.709 --> 01:21:33.719 align:start position:0%
the community or to the state or I know
 
01:21:36.629 --> 01:21:36.639 align:start position:0%
you were just discussing it but I'm not
 
01:21:40.830 --> 01:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
clear yeah um hold on there is a part of
 
01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
this bill uh
 
01:21:47.350 --> 01:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
specifies uh where the fines are in inur
 
01:21:50.110 --> 01:21:50.120 align:start position:0%
my favorite word hold on one
 
01:21:53.870 --> 01:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
second yeah line 17 All Fins under the
 
01:21:56.030 --> 01:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
section shall endure to the municipality
 
01:21:57.790 --> 01:21:57.800 align:start position:0%
or other agency that is responsible for
 
01:22:00.669 --> 01:22:00.679 align:start position:0%
the bridge thank you sorry Mr that's in
 
01:22:02.790 --> 01:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
the that's in the bill that we passed
 
01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:04.430 align:start position:0%
the that's in the bill that we passed
representative

01:22:04.430 --> 01:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:22:07.189 --> 01:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
Jones thank you um to answer your
 
01:22:10.550 --> 01:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
question Mr chair uh doesn't line 19 and
 
01:22:11.950 --> 01:22:11.960 align:start position:0%
20 say
 
01:22:15.149 --> 01:22:15.159 align:start position:0%
that uh they cover the
 
01:22:17.590 --> 01:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
cost responsibility for full cost of
 
01:22:20.430 --> 01:22:20.440 align:start position:0%
repair set a bridge doesn't that cover
 
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
what the question you asked
 
01:22:25.790 --> 01:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
uh it does but it was also a concern of
 
01:22:28.990 --> 01:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
the chair of Criminal Justice um you
 
01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
know say somebody had a $100,000 policy
 
01:22:33.669 --> 01:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
and they destroyed a million dollar
 
01:22:36.510 --> 01:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
Bridge um the way this is written they
 
01:22:38.189 --> 01:22:38.199 align:start position:0%
got to come up with a million bucks so
 
01:22:41.350 --> 01:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
that a potential cap for damages was
 
01:22:44.590 --> 01:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
also a thought of his Y and again these
 
01:22:45.950 --> 01:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
are the things they were looking at I
 
01:22:47.910 --> 01:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
mean when that's why I went we should
 
01:22:49.350 --> 01:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
have gone there because when you start
 
01:22:51.110 --> 01:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
raising the fines there's always other
 
01:22:53.030 --> 01:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
things that are outside our wheelhouse
 
01:22:54.350 --> 01:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
if you
 
01:22:57.990 --> 01:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
will right sir representa C okay as as I
 
01:23:01.270 --> 01:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
said here on line 17 Roman four that
 
01:23:03.550 --> 01:23:03.560 align:start position:0%
says that the fines are going to the
 
01:23:06.149 --> 01:23:06.159 align:start position:0%
agency that deals with the bridge and
 
01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
then Roman five which starts on line 19
 
01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
deals with u uncovering the damages that
 
01:23:16.709 --> 01:23:16.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:19.470 --> 01:23:19.480 align:start position:0%
occurred and it's I guess it's possible
 
01:23:22.590 --> 01:23:22.600 align:start position:0%
that somebody could uh Drive the wrong
 
01:23:25.070 --> 01:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
kind of vehicle cross the bridge and not
 
01:23:28.830 --> 01:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
damage it but would still be considered
 
01:23:30.550 --> 01:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
fine true I'm just mentioning one of the
 
01:23:35.110 --> 01:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
concerns the other committee had was
 
01:23:37.709 --> 01:23:37.719 align:start position:0%
that do we would we look at a cap for
 
01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
damages as opposed to putting a
 
01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:41.070 align:start position:0%
damages as opposed to putting a
multi-million

01:23:41.070 --> 01:23:41.080 align:start position:0%
multi-million
 
01:23:44.550 --> 01:23:44.560 align:start position:0%
dollar penalty or replacement cost on
 
01:23:45.910 --> 01:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
somebody that might have just had a bad
 
01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:53.270 align:start position:0%
 
example

01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:23:54.590 --> 01:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
I'm just throwing these out this is a
 
01:23:55.750 --> 01:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
work session it's a little different
 
01:23:57.629 --> 01:23:57.639 align:start position:0%
than the way we usually format things
 
01:23:59.270 --> 01:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
I'm throwing the stuff that I learned in
 
01:24:01.470 --> 01:24:01.480 align:start position:0%
my conversations out there and you throw
 
01:24:03.030 --> 01:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
it all back in me and at the end of the
 
01:24:04.910 --> 01:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
day we'll decide what to do represent
 
01:24:09.030 --> 01:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
SES so did I understand you I want to
 
01:24:11.750 --> 01:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
make sure I phrase my question um did I
 
01:24:13.229 --> 01:24:13.239 align:start position:0%
understand that this is now going to go
 
01:24:14.510 --> 01:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
to criminal
 
01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
justice there is no time so we P the
 
01:24:19.030 --> 01:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
deadline for second committee bills is
 
01:24:21.550 --> 01:24:21.560 align:start position:0%
passed that's why we were asked to hold
 
01:24:24.910 --> 01:24:24.920 align:start position:0%
on to it and work with them to come up
 
01:24:26.350 --> 01:24:26.360 align:start position:0%
with any amend we've not and we've not
 
01:24:28.950 --> 01:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
heard from them and we have not so there
 
01:24:31.830 --> 01:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
is another solution to this too um and I
 
01:24:33.990 --> 01:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
do not do this lightly nor am I
 
01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
recommending it but because we are where
 
01:24:37.750 --> 01:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
we are and we didn't get any potential
 
01:24:40.310 --> 01:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
amendments we let it go the way it is
 
01:24:43.470 --> 01:24:43.480 align:start position:0%
and it is going to another body and
 
01:24:45.030 --> 01:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
there is another opportunity for
 
01:24:47.229 --> 01:24:47.239 align:start position:0%
anything to get fixed it's not that we
 
01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
didn't try to do our due diligence we
 
01:24:51.109 --> 01:24:51.119 align:start position:0%
did uh but we don't have anything before
 
01:24:53.830 --> 01:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
us I I'm there's also the floor
 
01:24:56.189 --> 01:24:56.199 align:start position:0%
Amendment route they could come up with
 
01:24:58.070 --> 01:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
a floor Amendment if they wanted to
 
01:24:59.590 --> 01:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
change some of this they could do that
 
01:25:03.550 --> 01:25:03.560 align:start position:0%
too yeah y so my my sense of this whole
 
01:25:06.510 --> 01:25:06.520 align:start position:0%
kurur fluffle about these things is
 
01:25:08.910 --> 01:25:08.920 align:start position:0%
that this committee has made a very
 
01:25:10.990 --> 01:25:11.000 align:start position:0%
positive statement about the
 
01:25:13.310 --> 01:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
policy and we should follow through with
 
01:25:15.109 --> 01:25:15.119 align:start position:0%
that and make sure that we continue to
 
01:25:18.830 --> 01:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
support the policy if there are concerns
 
01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
about the implementation of penalties
 
01:25:24.189 --> 01:25:24.199 align:start position:0%
Etc it more appropriately belongs with
 
01:25:26.510 --> 01:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
either criminal justice or if the Senate
 
01:25:28.390 --> 01:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
gets the bill then they can have their
 
01:25:30.109 --> 01:25:30.119 align:start position:0%
criminal justice committee take up the
 
01:25:32.709 --> 01:25:32.719 align:start position:0%
bill but I think I I see no reason why
 
01:25:35.350 --> 01:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
we can't pass it as it is as we already
 
01:25:39.750 --> 01:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
have they had their chance too bad so
 
01:25:42.510 --> 01:25:42.520 align:start position:0%
sad well I have to
 
01:25:45.669 --> 01:25:45.679 align:start position:0%
agree rumo thank you may ask a question
 
01:25:47.350 --> 01:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
uh based on others experience in the
 
01:25:49.229 --> 01:25:49.239 align:start position:0%
room if if you were going to add a cap
 
01:25:51.270 --> 01:25:51.280 align:start position:0%
or down the road an amendment were going
 
01:25:53.510 --> 01:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
be made to add a cap how how do you
 
01:25:54.870 --> 01:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
reach the determination of the
 
01:25:56.390 --> 01:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate cap when you have you
 
01:25:58.070 --> 01:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
implemented that sort of language and
 
01:25:59.750 --> 01:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
other bills in the past before my time
 
01:26:01.390 --> 01:26:01.400 align:start position:0%
I'm just it seems for us to do it today
 
01:26:02.950 --> 01:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
seems like it would be arbitrary you
 
01:26:04.350 --> 01:26:04.360 align:start position:0%
know potentially and what number we're
 
01:26:06.550 --> 01:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
picking once again great question I
 
01:26:09.149 --> 01:26:09.159 align:start position:0%
don't have the answer to that okay
 
01:26:11.070 --> 01:26:11.080 align:start position:0%
interesting because I do that that is a
 
01:26:12.910 --> 01:26:12.920 align:start position:0%
concern here clearly I mean it was a
 
01:26:14.310 --> 01:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
legitimate Point yeah it is that's why I
 
01:26:17.750 --> 01:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
bring it up yeah uh represent I think
 
01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
isn't there a cap if you're for
 
01:26:21.629 --> 01:26:21.639 align:start position:0%
uninsured vehicle uninsured motorists in
 
01:26:24.030 --> 01:26:24.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire you're you're limited to
 
01:26:29.790 --> 01:26:29.800 align:start position:0%
the total liability if you know I think
 
01:26:31.270 --> 01:26:31.280 align:start position:0%
we might want to look into that and try
 
01:26:33.950 --> 01:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
to see if the language would I'm sure
 
01:26:35.950 --> 01:26:35.960 align:start position:0%
that people smarter than me could find
 
01:26:38.910 --> 01:26:38.920 align:start position:0%
language that would show how to do it um
 
01:26:40.669 --> 01:26:40.679 align:start position:0%
but again I I do agree with
 
01:26:43.550 --> 01:26:43.560 align:start position:0%
representative syes at this point um
 
01:26:46.270 --> 01:26:46.280 align:start position:0%
well let me take that back um I just
 
01:26:49.270 --> 01:26:49.280 align:start position:0%
left the clerk's office one two three
 
01:26:52.590 --> 01:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
four five six seven eight we're up to
 
01:26:53.910 --> 01:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
eight Senate bills and they've just
 
01:26:56.830 --> 01:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
gotten started so if you think there's
 
01:26:58.590 --> 01:26:58.600 align:start position:0%
something we could still do on this it
 
01:27:00.790 --> 01:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
is your choice we'll do stop Pooles on
 
01:27:04.430 --> 01:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
it so I think the choice is now we'll
 
01:27:05.470 --> 01:27:05.480 align:start position:0%
never get anything done for the
 
01:27:07.950 --> 01:27:07.960 align:start position:0%
executive session this afternoon other
 
01:27:09.390 --> 01:27:09.400 align:start position:0%
than leaving it alone and moving it
 
01:27:11.709 --> 01:27:11.719 align:start position:0%
forward that would be one option two
 
01:27:13.310 --> 01:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
would be to not take it up an executive
 
01:27:15.950 --> 01:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
session and come up with more amendments
 
01:27:18.070 --> 01:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
on our own so I think that's where we're
 
01:27:23.229 --> 01:27:23.239 align:start position:0%
at for choice I vot Punk okay
 
01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
and now this is why we don't see a lot
 
01:27:27.830 --> 01:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
of work sessions and
 
01:27:30.590 --> 01:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
Transportation uh representative blondon
 
01:27:34.709 --> 01:27:34.719 align:start position:0%
how are you thank you Mr chair um as far
 
01:27:36.070 --> 01:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
as I'm concerned I think this is still
 
01:27:39.310 --> 01:27:39.320 align:start position:0%
good legislation I'm fine with the fines
 
01:27:40.950 --> 01:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
my concern as I had mentioned in the
 
01:27:44.270 --> 01:27:44.280 align:start position:0%
prior meeting is due notice um you know
 
01:27:47.510 --> 01:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
a sign prior to the bridge whether it's
 
01:27:48.990 --> 01:27:49.000 align:start position:0%
we had heard testimony that some of
 
01:27:51.070 --> 01:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
these bridges are right off the road so
 
01:27:52.870 --> 01:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
just either further down down that same
 
01:27:55.629 --> 01:27:55.639 align:start position:0%
road something stating basically
 
01:27:57.550 --> 01:27:57.560 align:start position:0%
historic bridge ahead oversiz load
 
01:28:00.790 --> 01:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
subject to fines up to $2,000 and 100%
 
01:28:03.470 --> 01:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
cost of repairs so it's due notice
 
01:28:04.950 --> 01:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
01:28:08.070 --> 01:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
excuse most of these bridges are all
 
01:28:09.950 --> 01:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
signed now with the height requirements
 
01:28:12.030 --> 01:28:12.040 align:start position:0%
of people are still driving over
 
01:28:15.270 --> 01:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
them you give them due notice and I
 
01:28:17.590 --> 01:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
think that would hold up in a court of
 
01:28:20.950 --> 01:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
law any way shape or form that's my
 
01:28:22.590 --> 01:28:22.600 align:start position:0%
position on and you know this is why we
 
01:28:25.229 --> 01:28:25.239 align:start position:0%
go through this exercise you just
 
01:28:26.709 --> 01:28:26.719 align:start position:0%
reminded me of the third point the
 
01:28:28.270 --> 01:28:28.280 align:start position:0%
chairman of Criminal Justice brought up
 
01:28:30.830 --> 01:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
was the same thing adequate signage with
 
01:28:32.629 --> 01:28:32.639 align:start position:0%
enough time to turn around prior to
 
01:28:34.750 --> 01:28:34.760 align:start position:0%
going across the bridge however we did
 
01:28:36.070 --> 01:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
hear at the public hearing that there's
 
01:28:37.310 --> 01:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of bridges that don't have that
 
01:28:39.550 --> 01:28:39.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity that aren't and a lot of
 
01:28:42.430 --> 01:28:42.440 align:start position:0%
them are already doing that so again up
 
01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:43.149 align:start position:0%
them are already doing that so again up
to

01:28:43.149 --> 01:28:43.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:28:45.149 --> 01:28:45.159 align:start position:0%
us to follow
 
01:28:48.709 --> 01:28:48.719 align:start position:0%
M again I mean even I understand your
 
01:28:51.669 --> 01:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
point but on the on the road to that
 
01:28:51.679 --> 01:28:52.870 align:start position:0%
point but on the on the road to that
bridge

01:28:52.870 --> 01:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
bridge
 
01:28:55.709 --> 01:28:55.719 align:start position:0%
Fair notice prior to that so one let him
 
01:28:58.109 --> 01:28:58.119 align:start position:0%
know there's a historic Bridge coming up
 
01:29:00.109 --> 01:29:00.119 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have to be directly on the
 
01:29:03.430 --> 01:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
drive to the bridge I think that would
 
01:29:06.189 --> 01:29:06.199 align:start position:0%
be due notice and would comply with with
 
01:29:06.199 --> 01:29:07.270 align:start position:0%
be due notice and would comply with with
in

01:29:07.270 --> 01:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:29:09.870 --> 01:29:09.880 align:start position:0%
court my position thank and I do agree
 
01:29:11.550 --> 01:29:11.560 align:start position:0%
with you the only thing not mentioned is
 
01:29:14.669 --> 01:29:14.679 align:start position:0%
who's paying for the signs
 
01:29:18.350 --> 01:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
um again I was I pride myself in being
 
01:29:20.390 --> 01:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
an organized person and I thought I had
 
01:29:22.270 --> 01:29:22.280 align:start position:0%
everything nailed today and I was
 
01:29:23.790 --> 01:29:23.800 align:start position:0%
waiting for three amendments from
 
01:29:25.149 --> 01:29:25.159 align:start position:0%
criminal justice so that we could
 
01:29:27.470 --> 01:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
discuss them and and decide up and down
 
01:29:30.229 --> 01:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
I don't have them so we're punting uh
 
01:29:32.229 --> 01:29:32.239 align:start position:0%
again the question of this committee is
 
01:29:33.950 --> 01:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
if we're going to move it on today in
 
01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
executive session as is or if we want to
 
01:29:38.590 --> 01:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
hold on to it and work on it some more
 
01:29:41.350 --> 01:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
representative sers thank you Mr chair
 
01:29:43.510 --> 01:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
so I think we should just mooving on the
 
01:29:46.070 --> 01:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
way it is but also I I believe all these
 
01:29:47.870 --> 01:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
bridges are
 
01:29:50.390 --> 01:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
insured and if they're insured they're
 
01:29:51.950 --> 01:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
even if they're not able to collect the
 
01:29:55.109 --> 01:29:55.119 align:start position:0%
the amount due from The Violator at that
 
01:29:57.070 --> 01:29:57.080 align:start position:0%
point because you know their insurance
 
01:29:58.669 --> 01:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't cover it the bridge is still
 
01:29:59.590 --> 01:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
01:30:01.870 --> 01:30:01.880 align:start position:0%
fixed good point I do remember that as
 
01:30:03.590 --> 01:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
well representative
 
01:30:05.629 --> 01:30:05.639 align:start position:0%
Hill I think we
 
01:30:09.990 --> 01:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
can um easily send it on today with the
 
01:30:12.270 --> 01:30:12.280 align:start position:0%
knowledge that all these great ideas
 
01:30:15.030 --> 01:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
that the criminal justice committee has
 
01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
still have opportunities to be heard in
 
01:30:21.550 --> 01:30:21.560 align:start position:0%
the public and and debated um and so I
 
01:30:23.030 --> 01:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
would have no
 
01:30:27.510 --> 01:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
problem um executing it this
 
01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
afternoon represent
 
01:30:32.109 --> 01:30:32.119 align:start position:0%
Jones thank you I think I agree with
 
01:30:34.470 --> 01:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
representative Hill but uh I just want
 
01:30:37.030 --> 01:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
to ask wasn't the criminal justice Bill
 
01:30:39.790 --> 01:30:39.800 align:start position:0%
wasn't that more about allowing cameras
 
01:30:42.229 --> 01:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
and weren't they get jumping into our
 
01:30:45.870 --> 01:30:45.880 align:start position:0%
purview no it was a different bill it
 
01:30:48.109 --> 01:30:48.119 align:start position:0%
was a different Bill and both bills were
 
01:30:50.669 --> 01:30:50.679 align:start position:0%
supposed to go to them eventually they
 
01:30:53.350 --> 01:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
get the one specifically for cameras we
 
01:30:55.750 --> 01:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
got this one for policy first and then
 
01:30:57.470 --> 01:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
it was supposed to go to criminal
 
01:31:00.310 --> 01:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
justice and it was it was it was the
 
01:31:02.350 --> 01:31:02.360 align:start position:0%
office's mistake that it didn't go to
 
01:31:04.790 --> 01:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
the second committee so that's why we
 
01:31:06.270 --> 01:31:06.280 align:start position:0%
were asked to see if we could make the
 
01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
changes here the deadlines have passed
 
01:31:10.830 --> 01:31:10.840 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:31:14.629 --> 01:31:14.639 align:start position:0%
so we did try I understand now thank you
 
01:31:17.189 --> 01:31:17.199 align:start position:0%
and again there as we all know there's
 
01:31:20.229 --> 01:31:20.239 align:start position:0%
more opportunity for the things that
 
01:31:23.709 --> 01:31:23.719 align:start position:0%
have come up to be to be addressed again
 
01:31:25.229 --> 01:31:25.239 align:start position:0%
it's not the way we usually do things
 
01:31:28.270 --> 01:31:28.280 align:start position:0%
but that's where we stand so let's do
 
01:31:31.270 --> 01:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
this um just to raise a hands shall we
 
01:31:33.229 --> 01:31:33.239 align:start position:0%
move forward with this and execute this
 
01:31:36.550 --> 01:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:40.550 --> 01:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
is I guess that takes care of that so
 
01:31:42.189 --> 01:31:42.199 align:start position:0%
give me a few minutes to get regrouped
 
01:31:45.030 --> 01:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
here um we will we are done with 1457
 
01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:50.750 align:start position:0%
here um we will we are done with 1457
for

01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:50.760 --> 01:32:30.669 align:start position:0%
 
now

01:32:30.669 --> 01:32:30.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:32.109 --> 01:32:32.119 align:start position:0%
if you want to get your amendments ready
 
01:32:35.030 --> 01:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
we'll do what we have deemed the
 
01:32:37.229 --> 01:32:37.239 align:start position:0%
lemonade boat Bill
 
01:32:39.590 --> 01:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
next there should be three amendments on
 
01:32:42.070 --> 01:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
it uh two Germaine one for myself and
 
01:32:43.950 --> 01:32:43.960 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn and then obviously
 
01:32:50.629 --> 01:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:50.639 --> 01:34:34.470 align:start position:0%
 
heard

01:34:34.470 --> 01:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:37.870 --> 01:34:37.880 align:start position:0%
all right we'll get started on this um
 
01:34:40.310 --> 01:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
uh if you want to take a look at
 
01:34:44.030 --> 01:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment 0882 H that's the one I
 
01:34:46.590 --> 01:34:46.600 align:start position:0%
submitted that tries to address this
 
01:34:49.510 --> 01:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
this the problems or tries to solve the
 
01:34:50.910 --> 01:34:50.920 align:start position:0%
problems that the the reason the first
 
01:34:51.990 --> 01:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
bill was submitt
 
01:34:54.910 --> 01:34:54.920 align:start position:0%
admitted um it does create an exception
 
01:34:57.990 --> 01:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
and I did go over this with Captain dun
 
01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
Levy um I'm trying let me hold it up
 
01:35:02.350 --> 01:35:02.360 align:start position:0%
against the original
 
01:35:05.470 --> 01:35:05.480 align:start position:0%
Bill the concerns they had uh were
 
01:35:07.470 --> 01:35:07.480 align:start position:0%
basically F first of all they were find
 
01:35:09.590 --> 01:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
with an exception understanding that you
 
01:35:12.709 --> 01:35:12.719 align:start position:0%
know 16 18 year olds selling prepackaged
 
01:35:15.950 --> 01:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
foods and soda okay they they conceited
 
01:35:17.590 --> 01:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
they're not really concerned about it
 
01:35:18.990 --> 01:35:19.000 align:start position:0%
like you heard at the previous non
 
01:35:22.390 --> 01:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
gerain Amendment uh passengers uh is a
 
01:35:24.709 --> 01:35:24.719 align:start position:0%
concern and then also he got a good
 
01:35:27.550 --> 01:35:27.560 align:start position:0%
point what if somebody that's 16 years
 
01:35:29.590 --> 01:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
old wants to put a barbecue grill on
 
01:35:31.229 --> 01:35:31.239 align:start position:0%
their roow booat and start selling it
 
01:35:34.109 --> 01:35:34.119 align:start position:0%
with an LP you know hot food
 
01:35:38.030 --> 01:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
so this language was was developed from
 
01:35:40.950 --> 01:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
that so it leaves the 16 to 18 years of
 
01:35:45.229 --> 01:35:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:47.590 --> 01:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
vessel um on any public Waters of the
 
01:35:49.030 --> 01:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
state without a ballot certificate to
 
01:35:50.750 --> 01:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
act as operator of a commercial vessel
 
01:35:52.229 --> 01:35:52.239 align:start position:0%
if all the follow following conditions
 
01:35:55.470 --> 01:35:55.480 align:start position:0%
are met 16 ft or
 
01:35:57.629 --> 01:35:57.639 align:start position:0%
less vessel will be operated only for
 
01:35:59.350 --> 01:35:59.360 align:start position:0%
the selling of prepackaged foods and the
 
01:36:00.990 --> 01:36:01.000 align:start position:0%
vessel shall not be operated for the
 
01:36:03.310 --> 01:36:03.320 align:start position:0%

01:36:06.709 --> 01:36:06.719 align:start position:0%

toying vessels refueling or
 
01:36:13.149 --> 01:36:13.159 align:start position:0%
servicing in my conversations with the
 
01:36:15.510 --> 01:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
captain and he did review it with the
 
01:36:17.709 --> 01:36:17.719 align:start position:0%
commission they're fine with this this
 
01:36:19.149 --> 01:36:19.159 align:start position:0%
creates the exception they're not going
 
01:36:20.430 --> 01:36:20.440 align:start position:0%
to need to be certified they're not
 
01:36:23.149 --> 01:36:23.159 align:start position:0%
going to be the expected every year um
 
01:36:25.870 --> 01:36:25.880 align:start position:0%
and he said biom meain works for
 
01:36:29.910 --> 01:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
us the only thing representative Lynn's
 
01:36:33.550 --> 01:36:33.560 align:start position:0%
Amendment does differently which is
 
01:36:37.310 --> 01:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
0903 has changed that 16 years of age to
 
01:36:43.149 --> 01:36:43.159 align:start position:0%
18 from 14 to 18 so if you're okay with
 
01:36:44.950 --> 01:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
what the exception
 
01:36:48.390 --> 01:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
does according to the Marine Patrol then
 
01:36:50.669 --> 01:36:50.679 align:start position:0%
the only question we should well the
 
01:36:52.189 --> 01:36:52.199 align:start position:0%
only question I think we have as a
 
01:36:55.990 --> 01:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
committee is at what age do we think
 
01:36:58.709 --> 01:36:58.719 align:start position:0%
this should begin so I'll leave it to
 
01:37:01.510 --> 01:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
you to ponder for a moment do we want 14
 
01:37:06.350 --> 01:37:06.360 align:start position:0%
or 16 16 is current law I believe um so
 
01:37:08.709 --> 01:37:08.719 align:start position:0%
we'll start with
 
01:37:12.430 --> 01:37:12.440 align:start position:0%
that yep represent I I support the 14 my
 
01:37:14.270 --> 01:37:14.280 align:start position:0%
my son started operating a boat when he
 
01:37:20.709 --> 01:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
was like 10 and is what and at at 11 the
 
01:37:22.550 --> 01:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
kid was probably more skilled at
 
01:37:25.189 --> 01:37:25.199 align:start position:0%
operating about than I was so or I am
 
01:37:29.229 --> 01:37:29.239 align:start position:0%
now so okay represent rbo I would add
 
01:37:30.350 --> 01:37:30.360 align:start position:0%
only I feel like there are actually not
 
01:37:31.790 --> 01:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of opportunities for kids in that
 
01:37:34.510 --> 01:37:34.520 align:start position:0%
age range 14 to 16 to to be
 
01:37:36.149 --> 01:37:36.159 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurial to be working to be
 
01:37:37.350 --> 01:37:37.360 align:start position:0%
productive and so we feel like the
 
01:37:38.950 --> 01:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
safety aspect is handled it's a I think
 
01:37:42.189 --> 01:37:42.199 align:start position:0%
it's a limited but good opportunity for
 
01:37:45.470 --> 01:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
kids representative C are there any
 
01:37:48.149 --> 01:37:48.159 align:start position:0%
issues with the child labor laws or
 
01:37:50.390 --> 01:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
anything relevant to that for a
 
01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:53.390 align:start position:0%
anything relevant to that for a
14-year-old

01:37:53.390 --> 01:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:56.510 --> 01:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
you know I doubt it I know you can bag
 
01:37:59.629 --> 01:37:59.639 align:start position:0%
you can bag at Market Basket age 14 so
 
01:38:00.709 --> 01:38:00.719 align:start position:0%
there are there are and you can work at
 
01:38:02.109 --> 01:38:02.119 align:start position:0%
Dunkin' Donuts I believe in some limited
 
01:38:03.070 --> 01:38:03.080 align:start position:0%
capacity there are there are
 
01:38:04.709 --> 01:38:04.719 align:start position:0%
opportunities okay and those and those
 
01:38:06.390 --> 01:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
are federal laws that we don't have to
 
01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:07.750 align:start position:0%
are federal laws that we don't have to
worry

01:38:07.750 --> 01:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
worry
 
01:38:11.470 --> 01:38:11.480 align:start position:0%
about Fox does anyone recall the age of
 
01:38:14.310 --> 01:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
the young man who brought this forward
 
01:38:17.550 --> 01:38:17.560 align:start position:0%
turned 16 this summer thank you but I
 
01:38:20.109 --> 01:38:20.119 align:start position:0%
think he started doing it at
 
01:38:26.070 --> 01:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
14 preps have sixes so um I think we
 
01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:27.589 align:start position:0%
14 preps have sixes so um I think we
already

01:38:27.589 --> 01:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:38:31.709 --> 01:38:31.719 align:start position:0%
give permission to 14y olds to
 
01:38:31.719 --> 01:38:33.589 align:start position:0%
give permission to 14y olds to
operate

01:38:33.589 --> 01:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
operate
 
01:38:36.550 --> 01:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
snowmobiles and I I would be in support
 
01:38:38.589 --> 01:38:38.599 align:start position:0%
of the 14 because it would be more
 
01:38:42.709 --> 01:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
consistent with if 14y olds can safely
 
01:38:44.990 --> 01:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
operate with it admittedly they have a
 
01:38:49.070 --> 01:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
license and take an education course of
 
01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
those th000 pound vehicles or whatever
 
01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
they are on the snowmobile trails why
 
01:38:58.189 --> 01:38:58.199 align:start position:0%
can't a young person of 14 operate on
 
01:39:00.109 --> 01:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
Lake as well I think the consistency
 
01:39:02.350 --> 01:39:02.360 align:start position:0%
would be helpful sure you're supposed to
 
01:39:04.990 --> 01:39:05.000 align:start position:0%
be under the control of the parent
 
01:39:06.149 --> 01:39:06.159 align:start position:0%
that's the only difference that's the
 
01:39:07.870 --> 01:39:07.880 align:start position:0%
only difference admitted yeah thanks for
 
01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:09.629 align:start position:0%
only difference admitted yeah thanks for
that

01:39:09.629 --> 01:39:09.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:39:12.550 --> 01:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
correction I do see representative Lyn
 
01:39:14.229 --> 01:39:14.239 align:start position:0%
who'd like to chime in too anybody else
 
01:39:15.470 --> 01:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
01:39:18.790 --> 01:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
first represent sellers thank you Mr
 
01:39:20.790 --> 01:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
chair I do see on one other thing here
 
01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:21.750 align:start position:0%
chair I do see on one other thing here
that

01:39:21.750 --> 01:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:39:25.470 --> 01:39:25.480 align:start position:0%
little concerning is on B on line nine
 
01:39:27.070 --> 01:39:27.080 align:start position:0%
it says selling a
 
01:39:30.550 --> 01:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
prepackaged food I mean do I have to put
 
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
lemonade in a in a in a bottle and have
 
01:39:37.870 --> 01:39:37.880 align:start position:0%
it screw topped on and stamped or or can
 
01:39:40.990 --> 01:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:45.390 --> 01:39:45.400 align:start position:0%
cup well it says prepackaged food and or
 
01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:50.030 align:start position:0%
cup well it says prepackaged food and or
non-alcoholic

01:39:50.030 --> 01:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:53.510 align:start position:0%
 
beverages

01:39:53.510 --> 01:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:56.470 --> 01:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
I'll Circle that right now let's ask
 
01:39:58.189 --> 01:39:58.199 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn what he thinks
 
01:39:59.990 --> 01:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
because actually I believe he brought
 
01:40:05.270 --> 01:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:10.830 --> 01:40:10.840 align:start position:0%
too represent plumon thank you Mr
 
01:40:13.790 --> 01:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
chair I'm just a bit concerned at the 14
 
01:40:15.310 --> 01:40:15.320 align:start position:0%
I kind of lean more towards your
 
01:40:17.310 --> 01:40:17.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment for the 16 I understand the
 
01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:18.470 align:start position:0%
Amendment for the 16 I understand the
comments

01:40:18.470 --> 01:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
comments
 
01:40:21.669 --> 01:40:21.679 align:start position:0%
made my concern is our Lakes are
 
01:40:24.790 --> 01:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
becoming busier and busier and they're
 
01:40:26.990 --> 01:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
becoming more analogous to our
 
01:40:31.109 --> 01:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
roadways my other concern is at that age
 
01:40:33.510 --> 01:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh there's no identification so let's
 
01:40:36.750 --> 01:40:36.760 align:start position:0%
say Marine Patrol stops them or whatever
 
01:40:40.790 --> 01:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
uh there's no form of of of licensure if
 
01:40:45.189 --> 01:40:45.199 align:start position:0%
you will and my third concern is this
 
01:40:48.709 --> 01:40:48.719 align:start position:0%
legislation doesn't specifically outline
 
01:40:51.910 --> 01:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
freshwat um so theoretically
 
01:40:54.189 --> 01:40:54.199 align:start position:0%
we could have the lemonade Boats off of
 
01:40:57.790 --> 01:40:57.800 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth Harbor as well so those are
 
01:40:59.669 --> 01:40:59.679 align:start position:0%
just some of my concerns tell me if I'm
 
01:41:02.070 --> 01:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
wrong but some
 
01:41:09.070 --> 01:41:09.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:11.990 --> 01:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
chair there there is a definition in law
 
01:41:14.070 --> 01:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
sorry ahead there is a definition in law
 
01:41:16.189 --> 01:41:16.199 align:start position:0%
under RSA
 
01:41:20.910 --> 01:41:20.920 align:start position:0%
27120 uh that does specify that um
 
01:41:23.830 --> 01:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
public Waters of the state means Inland
 
01:41:26.229 --> 01:41:26.239 align:start position:0%
Waters that entirely over 10 acres
 
01:41:28.189 --> 01:41:28.199 align:start position:0%
entirely owned by the state so there is
 
01:41:33.790 --> 01:41:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:37.229 --> 01:41:37.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:40.669 --> 01:41:40.679 align:start position:0%
miles yeah a lake that's over 10 acres
 
01:41:44.550 --> 01:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
yeah freshwater lake that's it freshw
 
01:41:47.470 --> 01:41:47.480 align:start position:0%
yeah not no but the there is a def
 
01:41:49.470 --> 01:41:49.480 align:start position:0%
definition of public Waters of the State
 
01:41:52.950 --> 01:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
under 27120 specifies Inland fresh
 
01:41:55.750 --> 01:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
freshwater lakes or bodies of
 
01:41:55.760 --> 01:41:58.629 align:start position:0%
freshwater lakes or bodies of
water

01:41:58.629 --> 01:41:58.639 align:start position:0%
water
 
01:42:01.149 --> 01:42:01.159 align:start position:0%
yeah represent vnn your thoughts yeah
 
01:42:03.669 --> 01:42:03.679 align:start position:0%
you know I just wanted to say um I
 
01:42:05.550 --> 01:42:05.560 align:start position:0%
didn't not I didn't know this and and
 
01:42:06.910 --> 01:42:06.920 align:start position:0%
maybe the committee didn't know this and
 
01:42:09.790 --> 01:42:09.800 align:start position:0%
so I when I when I spoke to uh Mr Hils
 
01:42:11.790 --> 01:42:11.800 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Safety about this
 
01:42:13.390 --> 01:42:13.400 align:start position:0%
he tells me
 
01:42:16.149 --> 01:42:16.159 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't directly apply to this
 
01:42:17.510 --> 01:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
but for
 
01:42:21.109 --> 01:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
non-commercial boats under with a
 
01:42:23.950 --> 01:42:23.960 align:start position:0%
engines of under uh I think it's 25
 
01:42:26.189 --> 01:42:26.199 align:start position:0%
horsepower it might have been 45 but 25
 
01:42:28.629 --> 01:42:28.639 align:start position:0%
or 4 there's no age limit other words he
 
01:42:31.109 --> 01:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
said if you're if if you're not if if
 
01:42:34.189 --> 01:42:34.199 align:start position:0%
you want to operate a boat at five years
 
01:42:36.589 --> 01:42:36.599 align:start position:0%
old that's not commercial there's no
 
01:42:38.709 --> 01:42:38.719 align:start position:0%
you're allowed to do that so I think
 
01:42:41.350 --> 01:42:41.360 align:start position:0%
that um I agree I mean obviously this
 
01:42:43.430 --> 01:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
does apply this talks about an exception
 
01:42:47.550 --> 01:42:47.560 align:start position:0%
for the commercial but um I think to me
 
01:42:49.830 --> 01:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
14 years old does make you know does
 
01:42:52.870 --> 01:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
make does make sense for I mean the the
 
01:42:55.589 --> 01:42:55.599 align:start position:0%
analogy to the snowmobile whatever um I
 
01:42:58.030 --> 01:42:58.040 align:start position:0%
so I I guess I think that that does make
 
01:43:00.430 --> 01:43:00.440 align:start position:0%
sense the only thing I would say is that
 
01:43:03.669 --> 01:43:03.679 align:start position:0%
I asked um Mr Hills what the department
 
01:43:05.149 --> 01:43:05.159 align:start position:0%
of safety's position on this was and he
 
01:43:07.310 --> 01:43:07.320 align:start position:0%
said in terms of 1614 he said their
 
01:43:08.910 --> 01:43:08.920 align:start position:0%
position was neutral they didn't endorse
 
01:43:11.910 --> 01:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
it they didn't oppose it that to the
 
01:43:14.189 --> 01:43:14.199 align:start position:0%
exent that's helpful to the committee
 
01:43:15.550 --> 01:43:15.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for that and you know speaking
 
01:43:17.589 --> 01:43:17.599 align:start position:0%
of 14 years old the trends we're taking
 
01:43:20.030 --> 01:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
right now they'll be voting soon so so I
 
01:43:21.470 --> 01:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
guess they should be able to drive a
 
01:43:22.870 --> 01:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
boat you know the other thing I want to
 
01:43:24.629 --> 01:43:24.639 align:start position:0%
say and I I just want to take a moment
 
01:43:26.030 --> 01:43:26.040 align:start position:0%

01:43:28.070 --> 01:43:28.080 align:start position:0%

01:43:30.030 --> 01:43:30.040 align:start position:0%
important bills on on your agenda and
 
01:43:33.270 --> 01:43:33.280 align:start position:0%

to me I thank you our pleasure um
 
01:43:44.470 --> 01:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
anybody else from the committee um
 
01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:46.669 align:start position:0%
anybody else from the committee um

01:43:46.669 --> 01:43:46.679 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:43:48.669 --> 01:43:48.679 align:start position:0%
sellers thank you Mr chair I just want
 
01:43:51.109 --> 01:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
to say that when I was growing up as a
 
01:43:53.229 --> 01:43:53.239 align:start position:0%
young kid I would literally take my
 
01:43:55.589 --> 01:43:55.599 align:start position:0%
lawnmower out and go to different yards
 
01:43:57.950 --> 01:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
and more Lawns I mean I think I was
 
01:44:01.030 --> 01:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
probably 10 112 I mean this just
 
01:44:03.669 --> 01:44:03.679 align:start position:0%
promotes uh entrepreneurship and and the
 
01:44:05.470 --> 01:44:05.480 align:start position:0%
other thing on I'm going back to this uh
 
01:44:08.990 --> 01:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
line B again on on line nine B I'm
 
01:44:11.390 --> 01:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
saying we're actually limiting this to
 
01:44:14.510 --> 01:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
food I mean why why can't a kid sell
 
01:44:17.229 --> 01:44:17.239 align:start position:0%
fishing gear or boating gear or anything
 
01:44:19.589 --> 01:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
else for that
 
01:44:22.310 --> 01:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
matter you had to bring that up today
 
01:44:27.149 --> 01:44:27.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:29.709 --> 01:44:29.719 align:start position:0%
know well I I concur I mean I was 10
 
01:44:31.750 --> 01:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
years old I had five accounts so I get
 
01:44:35.270 --> 01:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
that so I'm fine with the 14 as well um
 
01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:37.709 align:start position:0%
that so I'm fine with the 14 as well um
anybody

01:44:37.709 --> 01:44:37.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:41.910 --> 01:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
else representative SE I I'm fine with
 
01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:46.990 align:start position:0%
else representative SE I I'm fine with
it

01:44:46.990 --> 01:44:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:50.109 --> 01:44:50.119 align:start position:0%
uh I'm I'm fine with it specifying
 
01:44:51.750 --> 01:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
prepack packag food and that would
 
01:44:53.750 --> 01:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
assume that the beverages would be
 
01:44:57.270 --> 01:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
prepackaged also so you soft drink
 
01:44:57.280 --> 01:44:58.390 align:start position:0%
prepackaged also so you soft drink
bottles

01:44:58.390 --> 01:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
bottles
 
01:45:02.030 --> 01:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
or um Gatorade or whatever somebody
 
01:45:07.550 --> 01:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
sell representative rbo I just I I would
 
01:45:12.510 --> 01:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
argue you could read this as it's okay
 
01:45:15.030 --> 01:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
to have lemonade in cups it's a food as
 
01:45:17.270 --> 01:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
we were hitting at before is that
 
01:45:19.589 --> 01:45:19.599 align:start position:0%
problematic to others on the committee
 
01:45:22.109 --> 01:45:22.119 align:start position:0%
okay and that was the intent of that
 
01:45:27.589 --> 01:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
language um so I guess at this
 
01:45:29.790 --> 01:45:29.800 align:start position:0%
point we could we could start making
 
01:45:31.229 --> 01:45:31.239 align:start position:0%
exceptions for a lot of different
 
01:45:33.790 --> 01:45:33.800 align:start position:0%
products do we want to move forward with
 
01:45:35.550 --> 01:45:35.560 align:start position:0%
what we've got at this point which is
 
01:45:38.470 --> 01:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
what came to us yes things can always be
 
01:45:40.750 --> 01:45:40.760 align:start position:0%
added or changed in the future or
 
01:45:43.310 --> 01:45:43.320 align:start position:0%
expanded or do we want to hold on to
 
01:45:45.229 --> 01:45:45.239 align:start position:0%
this create a subcommittee
 
01:45:47.870 --> 01:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
representative sellers that is going to
 
01:45:50.430 --> 01:45:50.440 align:start position:0%
look into maybe other types of business
 
01:45:52.310 --> 01:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
businesses that will be
 
01:45:56.870 --> 01:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:59.589 --> 01:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
yes raise a hands are we moving on the
 
01:46:04.430 --> 01:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
Way It Is Well what age oh at 14 at
 
01:46:07.109 --> 01:46:07.119 align:start position:0%
14 fair enough we'll put this one aside
 
01:46:10.109 --> 01:46:10.119 align:start position:0%
and we'll deal with it this
 
01:46:12.669 --> 01:46:12.679 align:start position:0%
afternoon well oh that's true that that
 
01:46:16.510 --> 01:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
takes care of the Germaine amendments
 
01:46:20.470 --> 01:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
now we just heard it our non gerain
 
01:46:25.790 --> 01:46:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:29.790 align:start position:0%
 
is

01:46:29.790 --> 01:46:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:31.589 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:46:31.589 --> 01:46:31.599 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:46:31.599 --> 01:46:33.990 align:start position:0%
right
0870

01:46:33.990 --> 01:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
0870
 
01:46:36.550 --> 01:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
H I'll open that one up for thoughts
 
01:46:38.070 --> 01:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
that we heard this morning of which I
 
01:46:46.070 --> 01:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:48.550 --> 01:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
simple I think it's an interim study
 
01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:49.390 align:start position:0%
simple I think it's an interim study
quite

01:46:49.390 --> 01:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
quite
 
01:46:52.430 --> 01:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
frankly um I think you're I
 
01:46:56.270 --> 01:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
think I think we're lucky um I don't
 
01:46:57.669 --> 01:46:57.679 align:start position:0%
know if I was recognized was I
 
01:47:00.629 --> 01:47:00.639 align:start position:0%
recognized representative Hill thank you
 
01:47:05.149 --> 01:47:05.159 align:start position:0%
um I think uh we are lucky that we heard
 
01:47:08.109 --> 01:47:08.119 align:start position:0%
um from a member of the public to bring
 
01:47:11.669 --> 01:47:11.679 align:start position:0%
this to our attention um otherwise we
 
01:47:14.350 --> 01:47:14.360 align:start position:0%
would have been perfectly happy and blly
 
01:47:16.109 --> 01:47:16.119 align:start position:0%
gone along and pass something that we
 
01:47:19.350 --> 01:47:19.360 align:start position:0%
may have regretted later on so it would
 
01:47:20.830 --> 01:47:20.840 align:start position:0%
seem to me
 
01:47:23.629 --> 01:47:23.639 align:start position:0%
um that there is a distinction between
 
01:47:26.669 --> 01:47:26.679 align:start position:0%
passenger and non-passenger commercial
 
01:47:29.550 --> 01:47:29.560 align:start position:0%
type things um I don't
 
01:47:35.070 --> 01:47:35.080 align:start position:0%
think as written this is um something
 
01:47:37.790 --> 01:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
that I would support I would I would
 
01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:39.589 align:start position:0%
that I would support I would I would
easily

01:47:39.589 --> 01:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
easily
 
01:47:43.550 --> 01:47:43.560 align:start position:0%
support this if it was um designated
 
01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
strictly for passenger commercial um
 
01:47:49.149 --> 01:47:49.159 align:start position:0%
which seems to be what the Marine Patrol
 
01:47:52.629 --> 01:47:52.639 align:start position:0%
was getting to and intended to do I'm
 
01:47:55.070 --> 01:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
still a little concerned how they are
 
01:47:58.750 --> 01:47:58.760 align:start position:0%
been doing these exams without any
 
01:48:01.229 --> 01:48:01.239 align:start position:0%
authorization from anything um but
 
01:48:04.589 --> 01:48:04.599 align:start position:0%
that's a whole another problem um but I
 
01:48:07.149 --> 01:48:07.159 align:start position:0%
would uh I would think we either need to
 
01:48:10.189 --> 01:48:10.199 align:start position:0%
amend this so that it includes just
 
01:48:13.790 --> 01:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
passenger Andor
 
01:48:16.390 --> 01:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
um any other suggestion that the chair
 
01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:18.270 align:start position:0%
um any other suggestion that the chair
may

01:48:18.270 --> 01:48:18.280 align:start position:0%
may
 
01:48:21.550 --> 01:48:21.560 align:start position:0%
have anybody else represent
 
01:48:24.750 --> 01:48:24.760 align:start position:0%
C I'm sort of just because this was all
 
01:48:27.310 --> 01:48:27.320 align:start position:0%
new and sprung on us I'm sort of of the
 
01:48:29.270 --> 01:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
opinion this might be something that
 
01:48:32.950 --> 01:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
ought to be brought next year as a new
 
01:48:36.270 --> 01:48:36.280 align:start position:0%
bill okay let me um throw the same
 
01:48:39.830 --> 01:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
options out that I did on the other Bill
 
01:48:42.669 --> 01:48:42.679 align:start position:0%
I know it was just given to us uh I
 
01:48:44.669 --> 01:48:44.679 align:start position:0%
truly believe it was going to be simpler
 
01:48:46.470 --> 01:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
I'm glad we did get the opposing views
 
01:48:47.629 --> 01:48:47.639 align:start position:0%
because I think there are questions that
 
01:48:50.310 --> 01:48:50.320 align:start position:0%
need to be answered so our question is
 
01:48:53.350 --> 01:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
is because it's not our last day here do
 
01:48:55.109 --> 01:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
we want to move forward with our
 
01:48:57.790 --> 01:48:57.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment to the original Bill and not
 
01:49:00.270 --> 01:49:00.280 align:start position:0%
take this up or do we want to hold on to
 
01:49:03.430 --> 01:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
this bill and work on the non gerain
 
01:49:06.550 --> 01:49:06.560 align:start position:0%
Amendment based on the knowledge that we
 
01:49:08.189 --> 01:49:08.199 align:start position:0%
learned this morning so I guess that's
 
01:49:09.990 --> 01:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
the decision that we've
 
01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:13.270 align:start position:0%
the decision that we've
got

01:49:13.270 --> 01:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:16.310 --> 01:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
um representative h i compare with
 
01:49:20.430 --> 01:49:20.440 align:start position:0%
representative Hill that um we just
 
01:49:21.830 --> 01:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
tipped the you know gotten the tip the
 
01:49:24.270 --> 01:49:24.280 align:start position:0%
iceberg of what the concerns may be I I
 
01:49:26.790 --> 01:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
think I I have concerns that this may
 
01:49:28.990 --> 01:49:29.000 align:start position:0%
lead to some unintended consequences as
 
01:49:31.589 --> 01:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
is and even if we tried to amend it it
 
01:49:33.550 --> 01:49:33.560 align:start position:0%
may end up being a you know window
 
01:49:35.669 --> 01:49:35.679 align:start position:0%
tinting bill that we cause more problems
 
01:49:37.589 --> 01:49:37.599 align:start position:0%
in the LA he hey hey
 
01:49:39.470 --> 01:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
hey all
 
01:49:43.470 --> 01:49:43.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:47.390 --> 01:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
up did they say touche thank you for
 
01:49:51.629 --> 01:49:51.639 align:start position:0%
yeah anybody else all right then I'll
 
01:49:54.350 --> 01:49:54.360 align:start position:0%
look at a raise of hands I guess raise
 
01:49:56.310 --> 01:49:56.320 align:start position:0%
your hand if you think uh we should not
 
01:49:59.629 --> 01:49:59.639 align:start position:0%
entertain this and uh move on with the
 
01:50:01.669 --> 01:50:01.679 align:start position:0%
bill the original bill as amended that
 
01:50:01.679 --> 01:50:03.950 align:start position:0%
bill the original bill as amended that
we've

01:50:03.950 --> 01:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
we've
 
01:50:07.910 --> 01:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
got and not take up the non gerain or
 
01:50:10.990 --> 01:50:11.000 align:start position:0%
okay so that's any right uh it's not
 
01:50:12.070 --> 01:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't have any Merit I think
 
01:50:14.750 --> 01:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of Merit but um we've got
 
01:50:16.709 --> 01:50:16.719 align:start position:0%
deadlines too to get our bills done our
 
01:50:18.790 --> 01:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
house bills and we're running out of
 
01:50:21.070 --> 01:50:21.080 align:start position:0%
time quite frankly as well I I have a
 
01:50:23.310 --> 01:50:23.320 align:start position:0%
question to the chair
 
01:50:28.070 --> 01:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
what um this came to us because of um
 
01:50:31.990 --> 01:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
action go ongoing with jel car what what
 
01:50:34.750 --> 01:50:34.760 align:start position:0%
happens if we don't take this up um
 
01:50:36.510 --> 01:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
regarding that
 
01:50:39.950 --> 01:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
action well I don't know I can only
 
01:50:41.229 --> 01:50:41.239 align:start position:0%
presume they're going to continue doing
 
01:50:43.229 --> 01:50:43.239 align:start position:0%
it the way they've been doing it even
 
01:50:45.350 --> 01:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
though they couldn't do it with no
 
01:50:48.149 --> 01:50:48.159 align:start position:0%
authorization in other wordss um I don't
 
01:50:51.149 --> 01:50:51.159 align:start position:0%
see any represent of SES
 
01:50:54.189 --> 01:50:54.199 align:start position:0%
I just I I think the chairman earlier
 
01:50:56.910 --> 01:50:56.920 align:start position:0%
had outlined some possibilities for
 
01:50:58.629 --> 01:50:58.639 align:start position:0%
further action on amendments that
 
01:51:00.990 --> 01:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
weren't necessarily ready for prime time
 
01:51:02.870 --> 01:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
about how this committee could continue
 
01:51:06.910 --> 01:51:06.920 align:start position:0%
to entertain a way to work on this there
 
01:51:09.189 --> 01:51:09.199 align:start position:0%
are but I I believe we shouldn't bring
 
01:51:11.390 --> 01:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
It Forward on this particular bill
 
01:51:13.990 --> 01:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
because it is non gerain and also
 
01:51:16.950 --> 01:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
because there's a lot of questions now
 
01:51:19.470 --> 01:51:19.480 align:start position:0%
but it it's not closing the door
 
01:51:22.189 --> 01:51:22.199 align:start position:0%
completely is my point of view and why
 
01:51:25.629 --> 01:51:25.639 align:start position:0%
we would not take it up uh on this
 
01:51:28.430 --> 01:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
particular Bill the non-gain
 
01:51:30.390 --> 01:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
piece well let me take a look at the
 
01:51:32.750 --> 01:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
Senate bill by title that we're getting
 
01:51:34.750 --> 01:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
and maybe there's an appropriate place
 
01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:48.960 --> 01:53:08.270 align:start position:0%
 
second

01:53:08.270 --> 01:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:11.069 --> 01:53:11.079 align:start position:0%
we have till the 4th of April to report
 
01:53:12.990 --> 01:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
out of committee anything we want to see
 
01:53:16.030 --> 01:53:16.040 align:start position:0%
go to the floor not on a second right
 
01:53:17.270 --> 01:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
well that's the last dat of report on
 
01:53:18.750 --> 01:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
all house
 
01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:22.149 align:start position:0%
all house
bills

01:53:22.149 --> 01:53:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:24.270 --> 01:53:24.280 align:start position:0%
well I don't see anything in our Senate
 
01:53:25.709 --> 01:53:25.719 align:start position:0%
bills yet
 
01:53:28.310 --> 01:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
that that are germine but it doesn't
 
01:53:29.830 --> 01:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
stop us from putting it anywhere we see
 
01:53:31.270 --> 01:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
fit plus we're probably going to have
 
01:53:33.229 --> 01:53:33.239 align:start position:0%
more perhaps I should have picture
 
01:53:35.990 --> 01:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
framed it a little bit differently but
 
01:53:39.430 --> 01:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
the question I guess still stands do we
 
01:53:42.990 --> 01:53:43.000 align:start position:0%
want to pursue working on the non-
 
01:53:45.189 --> 01:53:45.199 align:start position:0%
gerain amendment on this bill or would
 
01:53:49.030 --> 01:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
we like to keep the the topic in mind to
 
01:53:51.189 --> 01:53:51.199 align:start position:0%
work on it on a Bild that may be coming
 
01:53:53.589 --> 01:53:53.599 align:start position:0%
down our way soon and we got the straw
 
01:53:55.270 --> 01:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
pole that everybody said we would like
 
01:53:57.830 --> 01:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
to just move on with 1158 the way it is
 
01:54:00.750 --> 01:54:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:03.910 --> 01:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
there okay well well that's still I
 
01:54:06.709 --> 01:54:06.719 align:start position:0%
think we still need to ask gel car
 
01:54:10.149 --> 01:54:10.159 align:start position:0%
whether there there is a deadline that
 
01:54:13.709 --> 01:54:13.719 align:start position:0%
they have that would maybe push us to
 
01:54:16.709 --> 01:54:16.719 align:start position:0%
look at it in the next month rather than
 
01:54:20.109 --> 01:54:20.119 align:start position:0%
wait until the second half from the
 
01:54:22.950 --> 01:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
Senate bills um I don't know let me ask
 
01:54:24.550 --> 01:54:24.560 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn as a member of Jael
 
01:54:26.669 --> 01:54:26.679 align:start position:0%
car what happens if we don't take this
 
01:54:29.669 --> 01:54:29.679 align:start position:0%
up immediately and send it waiting for
 
01:54:33.669 --> 01:54:33.679 align:start position:0%
another day you know what I I I I think
 
01:54:35.510 --> 01:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
as a practical matter really nothing
 
01:54:37.830 --> 01:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
happened I mean the the this issue came
 
01:54:40.350 --> 01:54:40.360 align:start position:0%
up because as as I think you've heard
 
01:54:42.229 --> 01:54:42.239 align:start position:0%
there was a question about whether the
 
01:54:43.430 --> 01:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
whether the department of safety had
 
01:54:46.310 --> 01:54:46.320 align:start position:0%
this had the authority uh to administer
 
01:54:49.910 --> 01:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
these kind of practical tests um if you
 
01:54:51.550 --> 01:54:51.560 align:start position:0%
know I don't I don't know this but I
 
01:54:53.709 --> 01:54:53.719 align:start position:0%
assume that if if if not if the law
 
01:54:56.669 --> 01:54:56.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't change Jael car uh I mean uh the
 
01:54:58.270 --> 01:54:58.280 align:start position:0%
department of safety would continue with
 
01:55:00.510 --> 01:55:00.520 align:start position:0%
its current practice which may be
 
01:55:02.510 --> 01:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
unlawful but you know presumably if
 
01:55:03.990 --> 01:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
somebody if somebody thinks it's
 
01:55:05.790 --> 01:55:05.800 align:start position:0%
unlawful they'll challenge it that in
 
01:55:07.430 --> 01:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
other words I'm not saying that this
 
01:55:09.750 --> 01:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to be fixed but I do think
 
01:55:11.910 --> 01:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
it may you know in light of of issues
 
01:55:13.350 --> 01:55:13.360 align:start position:0%
that apparently have been raised I do
 
01:55:15.510 --> 01:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
think it makes sense you know for this
 
01:55:17.669 --> 01:55:17.679 align:start position:0%
committee not to act precipitously but
 
01:55:20.390 --> 01:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
rather to wait and you know
 
01:55:23.109 --> 01:55:23.119 align:start position:0%
look at it more carefully and and you
 
01:55:25.910 --> 01:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
know like it's not gonna it's not going
 
01:55:28.229 --> 01:55:28.239 align:start position:0%
to interfere with with anything that JW
 
01:55:31.109 --> 01:55:31.119 align:start position:0%
car is doing um it just will leave this
 
01:55:32.390 --> 01:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
this issue kind of up in the air but
 
01:55:34.470 --> 01:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
that's that that's all
 
01:55:36.870 --> 01:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
right in other words an analogy I like
 
01:55:42.830 --> 01:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:45.629 --> 01:55:45.639 align:start position:0%
spin so um I don't think we need to do
 
01:55:47.390 --> 01:55:47.400 align:start position:0%
it again I think we're in agreement we
 
01:55:49.069 --> 01:55:49.079 align:start position:0%
have this amendment keep it in your
 
01:55:49.079 --> 01:55:50.390 align:start position:0%
have this amendment keep it in your
files

01:55:50.390 --> 01:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
files
 
01:55:52.270 --> 01:55:52.280 align:start position:0%
and keep it in your thoughts if we see
 
01:55:54.510 --> 01:55:54.520 align:start position:0%
the opportunity we can take it up uh if
 
01:55:57.390 --> 01:55:57.400 align:start position:0%
not there are always other opportunities
 
01:55:58.870 --> 01:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
okay so we'll leave that one
 
01:56:01.430 --> 01:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
alone uh or move on with the Germaine
 
01:56:04.390 --> 01:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment at 14 but we but we do still
 
01:56:08.470 --> 01:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
have to amend all uh I'm just going
 
01:56:10.550 --> 01:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
through this to get through what we're
 
01:56:12.830 --> 01:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
prepared to do in our executive session
 
01:56:16.669 --> 01:56:16.679 align:start position:0%
um the two amendments we had that were
 
01:56:20.790 --> 01:56:20.800 align:start position:0%
jine excuse me um they don't they don't
 
01:56:23.149 --> 01:56:23.159 align:start position:0%
need to be reconciled they are identical
 
01:56:26.589 --> 01:56:26.599 align:start position:0%
except for the the age so we so we can
 
01:56:26.599 --> 01:56:27.709 align:start position:0%
except for the the age so we so we can
AR

01:56:27.709 --> 01:56:27.719 align:start position:0%
AR
 
01:56:31.270 --> 01:56:31.280 align:start position:0%

merging necessary it's just one of the
 
01:56:37.470 --> 01:56:37.480 align:start position:0%
other I didn't know if there needed to
 
01:56:39.589 --> 01:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
be us any merging done of those Noe just

I'm actually going to recess this for 15
 
01:57:57.270 --> 01:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
minutes this work session I've got to go
 
01:57:59.030 --> 01:57:59.040 align:start position:0%

to continue to familiarize yourself with
 
01:58:18.310 --> 01:58:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:48.310 --> 01:58:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:48.320 --> 02:21:09.469 align:start position:0%
 
11:45

02:21:09.469 --> 02:21:09.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:12.950 --> 02:21:12.960 align:start position:0%

02:21:14.910 --> 02:21:14.920 align:start position:0%
committee work
 
02:21:16.950 --> 02:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
session and we might as well take this
 
02:21:18.510 --> 02:21:18.520 align:start position:0%
one up
 
02:21:22.469 --> 02:21:22.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:36.830 --> 02:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:46.230 --> 02:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:46.240 --> 02:21:49.349 align:start position:0%
 
original

02:21:49.349 --> 02:21:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:50.990 --> 02:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
the original title relative to the
 
02:21:52.950 --> 02:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
protection of personal information in
 
02:21:52.960 --> 02:21:55.070 align:start position:0%
protection of personal information in
driver's

02:21:55.070 --> 02:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
driver's
 
02:21:55.080 --> 02:21:56.630 align:start position:0%
driver's
licenses

02:21:56.630 --> 02:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
02:21:59.429 --> 02:21:59.439 align:start position:0%
um I have to say this is probably one of
 
02:22:00.870 --> 02:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
the heaviest lifts I've seen in
 
02:22:02.630 --> 02:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
transportation in a
 
02:22:07.389 --> 02:22:07.399 align:start position:0%
while um I take it seriously only in the
 
02:22:10.469 --> 02:22:10.479 align:start position:0%
fact or for the fact that I mean I'm old
 
02:22:13.670 --> 02:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
school and I'm very weary of my license
 
02:22:15.670 --> 02:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
being scanned everywhere I go for every
 
02:22:18.150 --> 02:22:18.160 align:start position:0%
service but apparently not the only one
 
02:22:20.670 --> 02:22:20.680 align:start position:0%
because if you remember in 2018 we not
 
02:22:24.230 --> 02:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
only passed the CAC out out of this this
 
02:22:26.510 --> 02:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
this house but it actually made it to
 
02:22:28.590 --> 02:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
the ballot and the overwhelming majority
 
02:22:30.870 --> 02:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
of people in this state are still
 
02:22:34.030 --> 02:22:34.040 align:start position:0%
concerned about it as well
 
02:22:34.040 --> 02:22:36.590 align:start position:0%
concerned about it as well
um

02:22:36.590 --> 02:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:39.349 --> 02:22:39.359 align:start position:0%
unfortunately since representative alry
 
02:22:43.110 --> 02:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
put the bill in I have met every
 
02:22:46.510 --> 02:22:46.520 align:start position:0%
lobbyist that's registered to do work in
 
02:22:48.030 --> 02:22:48.040 align:start position:0%
this building
 
02:22:49.550 --> 02:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
looking for a car route for their
 
02:22:49.560 --> 02:22:51.550 align:start position:0%
looking for a car route for their
particular

02:22:51.550 --> 02:22:51.560 align:start position:0%
particular
 
02:22:54.070 --> 02:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
industry uh a lot of those car routes
 
02:22:57.550 --> 02:22:57.560 align:start position:0%
are currently in 264 irsa
 
02:23:01.910 --> 02:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
2614 and in an effort to eliminate all
 
02:23:04.429 --> 02:23:04.439 align:start position:0%
of the concerns at this point I tried to
 
02:23:06.790 --> 02:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
get an amendment drafted well I got one
 
02:23:08.870 --> 02:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
drafted uh that would just kind of
 
02:23:11.750 --> 02:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
concentrate on retail sales for an
 
02:23:13.830 --> 02:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
example uh right now I don't know if you
 
02:23:15.830 --> 02:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
know this but anytime you want to go buy
 
02:23:18.590 --> 02:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
a sixpack or a pack of cigarettes they
 
02:23:20.910 --> 02:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
refuse to do business with you unless
 
02:23:23.150 --> 02:23:23.160 align:start position:0%
they take your license scan it and
 
02:23:25.070 --> 02:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
capture your
 
02:23:27.750 --> 02:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
information why and nobody knows where
 
02:23:29.070 --> 02:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
that information goes I think it's
 
02:23:31.030 --> 02:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
infuriating and again they Pro they deny
 
02:23:34.349 --> 02:23:34.359 align:start position:0%
you Service uh if if you don't comply
 
02:23:37.590 --> 02:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
with the retaining of your personal
 
02:23:40.870 --> 02:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
information I just left OLS uh for a
 
02:23:42.630 --> 02:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
couple questions on the amendment that
 
02:23:45.070 --> 02:23:45.080 align:start position:0%
I've given you which
 
02:23:50.950 --> 02:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
is 09 18h and even this one is going to
 
02:23:53.750 --> 02:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
require a little bit more work
 
02:23:57.349 --> 02:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
um uh to to get where I was trying to
 
02:23:59.429 --> 02:23:59.439 align:start position:0%
get to in terms of just the the resid
 
02:24:01.710 --> 02:24:01.720 align:start position:0%
the retail end of
 
02:24:05.870 --> 02:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
things um I guess at this point we have
 
02:24:08.830 --> 02:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
till what' you say March 21st on this
 
02:24:11.790 --> 02:24:11.800 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask the committee um where
 
02:24:15.750 --> 02:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
you are on the theory on this and once
 
02:24:18.670 --> 02:24:18.680 align:start position:0%
again we we got options we've got a
 
02:24:21.469 --> 02:24:21.479 align:start position:0%
little bit of time we have interim
 
02:24:25.150 --> 02:24:25.160 align:start position:0%
studies we have put it someplace else if
 
02:24:27.469 --> 02:24:27.479 align:start position:0%
we can get it done I guess the first
 
02:24:29.309 --> 02:24:29.319 align:start position:0%
question I got for you is do you agree
 
02:24:31.710 --> 02:24:31.720 align:start position:0%
with the theory of trying to tackle this
 
02:24:34.469 --> 02:24:34.479 align:start position:0%
issue or do you think we're the water is
 
02:24:36.750 --> 02:24:36.760 align:start position:0%
already gone over the dam it's too late
 
02:24:39.030 --> 02:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
and people are going to do whatever they
 
02:24:41.990 --> 02:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
want with our information in perpetuity
 
02:24:45.190 --> 02:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
what say you representative
 
02:24:48.110 --> 02:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
sellers thank you Mr chair
 
02:24:50.630 --> 02:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
I've had several people come to me with
 
02:24:53.830 --> 02:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
this irritation of the the license being
 
02:24:56.790 --> 02:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
scanned and not knowing what data is
 
02:24:58.630 --> 02:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
being collected or if it's being
 
02:25:01.269 --> 02:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
collected of all um I've had
 
02:25:04.150 --> 02:25:04.160 align:start position:0%
conversations with DMV and and it's come
 
02:25:07.110 --> 02:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
to my understanding that when you scan
 
02:25:09.429 --> 02:25:09.439 align:start position:0%
that barcode on the back of your license
 
02:25:12.950 --> 02:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
every bit of information on the front is
 
02:25:16.550 --> 02:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
is uh available to the retailer all of
 
02:25:19.190 --> 02:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
it your eyes your hair color your weight
 
02:25:23.630 --> 02:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
your your height so when they only need
 
02:25:25.389 --> 02:25:25.399 align:start position:0%
the date of birth to verify that you're
 
02:25:29.910 --> 02:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
an certain age it's it's it's getting to
 
02:25:32.230 --> 02:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
be worse and it's getting worse as the
 
02:25:34.990 --> 02:25:35.000 align:start position:0%
days go on I would like to see something
 
02:25:37.349 --> 02:25:37.359 align:start position:0%
past you know to at least stop the
 
02:25:40.070 --> 02:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
retailers from doing this it's it's just
 
02:25:42.910 --> 02:25:42.920 align:start position:0%
it's uncal for you know that's our
 
02:25:45.309 --> 02:25:45.319 align:start position:0%
personal information and talking to the
 
02:25:47.910 --> 02:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
MV even though they might be a rule in
 
02:25:49.870 --> 02:25:49.880 align:start position:0%
place that you know they're not supposed
 
02:25:54.349 --> 02:25:54.359 align:start position:0%
to do X Y and Z it's like now the
 
02:25:57.389 --> 02:25:57.399 align:start position:0%
burdens on them to go find out and and
 
02:25:59.389 --> 02:25:59.399 align:start position:0%
find from the retailers saying well show
 
02:26:01.110 --> 02:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
us that you're not storing the data you
 
02:26:03.030 --> 02:26:03.040 align:start position:0%
know and then who's going to prosecute
 
02:26:05.830 --> 02:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
it because you know it it just TS to be
 
02:26:08.550 --> 02:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
really really muddy at that point so we
 
02:26:11.070 --> 02:26:11.080 align:start position:0%
need to do something at least maybe for
 
02:26:13.150 --> 02:26:13.160 align:start position:0%
the retailers
 
02:26:15.269 --> 02:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
anyway thank you and then that that's
 
02:26:16.990 --> 02:26:17.000 align:start position:0%
why I get passionate about this is as
 
02:26:20.630 --> 02:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
well um so the committee knows too uh in
 
02:26:24.429 --> 02:26:24.439 align:start position:0%
in your looking at this uh we I believe
 
02:26:27.150 --> 02:26:27.160 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 255 that was retained last
 
02:26:29.550 --> 02:26:29.560 align:start position:0%
year is on its way to the governor's
 
02:26:32.030 --> 02:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
desk which also deals with privacy
 
02:26:34.190 --> 02:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the title of that bill is
 
02:26:38.990 --> 02:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
our expectation of privacy so I it's
 
02:26:40.429 --> 02:26:40.439 align:start position:0%
continuing the watering down is
 
02:26:41.950 --> 02:26:41.960 align:start position:0%
continuing over what I believe the
 
02:26:43.349 --> 02:26:43.359 align:start position:0%
people of the state are looking for us
 
02:26:45.630 --> 02:26:45.640 align:start position:0%
to do
 
02:26:48.269 --> 02:26:48.279 align:start position:0%
um but but again the best I can see out
 
02:26:51.190 --> 02:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
of 255 is that well if they collect your
 
02:26:53.230 --> 02:26:53.240 align:start position:0%
information you can request that they
 
02:26:57.190 --> 02:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
remove it and I I I don't see that as
 
02:27:00.469 --> 02:27:00.479 align:start position:0%
practical I separate a lot of these
 
02:27:03.030 --> 02:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
industries um you've got banking you've
 
02:27:05.590 --> 02:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
got insurance uh my goodness even
 
02:27:07.510 --> 02:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
Comcast was jumping up and down because
 
02:27:09.150 --> 02:27:09.160 align:start position:0%
they couldn't scan people's licenses
 
02:27:11.190 --> 02:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
anymore uh again I've met just about
 
02:27:12.750 --> 02:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
every lobbyist in this building with an
 
02:27:15.950 --> 02:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
upper Carbell I don't have a problem and
 
02:27:17.710 --> 02:27:17.720 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in either the original
 
02:27:19.710 --> 02:27:19.720 align:start position:0%
bill or in this amendment that says you
 
02:27:22.150 --> 02:27:22.160 align:start position:0%
can't voluntarily do it if you need to
 
02:27:23.870 --> 02:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
buy a new car and you and they need your
 
02:27:26.750 --> 02:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
license to do it you got a choice and
 
02:27:29.630 --> 02:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
with 255 you can also specifically say I
 
02:27:31.230 --> 02:27:31.240 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that information is
 
02:27:36.150 --> 02:27:36.160 align:start position:0%
gone but on the the the everyday retail
 
02:27:38.230 --> 02:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
it could be 10 times a week could be 15
 
02:27:40.070 --> 02:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
times a week I mean that's just where I
 
02:27:43.110 --> 02:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
see it imp practical for 255 to even
 
02:27:46.030 --> 02:27:46.040 align:start position:0%
work uh so thank you for that I agree
 
02:27:48.030 --> 02:27:48.040 align:start position:0%
anybody else any
 
02:27:50.910 --> 02:27:50.920 align:start position:0%
thoughts representative Gorski thank you
 
02:27:53.630 --> 02:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I I kind of tend to agree I
 
02:27:55.190 --> 02:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
think we're getting to the point where
 
02:27:57.309 --> 02:27:57.319 align:start position:0%
our information is taken haphazardly all
 
02:27:59.510 --> 02:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
the time and I think we have to put some
 
02:28:02.230 --> 02:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
guard rails up and I think this may be a
 
02:28:03.950 --> 02:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
start to put some of those guard rails
 
02:28:06.150 --> 02:28:06.160 align:start position:0%
up for people so they can protect their
 
02:28:07.950 --> 02:28:07.960 align:start position:0%
information so I think we should try to
 
02:28:10.670 --> 02:28:10.680 align:start position:0%
do something at least to put those guard
 
02:28:14.429 --> 02:28:14.439 align:start position:0%
rails up and protect the citizens of New
 
02:28:16.429 --> 02:28:16.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire anybody else representative
 
02:28:16.439 --> 02:28:17.550 align:start position:0%
Hampshire anybody else representative
Hill

02:28:17.550 --> 02:28:17.560 align:start position:0%
Hill
 
02:28:20.389 --> 02:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
uh didn't we just pass a constitutional
 
02:28:22.630 --> 02:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
amendment I just referred to it and
 
02:28:25.990 --> 02:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
that's why it was in 2018 I believe um
 
02:28:27.750 --> 02:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
and that's why I took this bill
 
02:28:30.429 --> 02:28:30.439 align:start position:0%
seriously and have been trying to do
 
02:28:32.510 --> 02:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
whatever I can to get something adopted
 
02:28:35.269 --> 02:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
but in spite of that Amendment um and in
 
02:28:38.030 --> 02:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
spite of RSA 2614 although it does have
 
02:28:40.710 --> 02:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
some car votes it seems that everybody's
 
02:28:43.910 --> 02:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
just doing it anyway but but isn't that
 
02:28:47.070 --> 02:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
the beginning of these guard rails that
 
02:28:49.670 --> 02:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
Vice chair Gorski
 
02:28:54.630 --> 02:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:58.110 --> 02:28:58.120 align:start position:0%
enough anybody else representative C is
 
02:29:01.030 --> 02:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
there federal regulations that require
 
02:29:03.590 --> 02:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
the barcode to be on the license can we
 
02:29:06.349 --> 02:29:06.359 align:start position:0%
prohibit them from putting a barcode on
 
02:29:08.910 --> 02:29:08.920 align:start position:0%
there or limiting the information that
 
02:29:11.110 --> 02:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
the barcode has to less than what's on
 
02:29:13.710 --> 02:29:13.720 align:start position:0%
the actual license
 
02:29:16.030 --> 02:29:16.040 align:start position:0%
document I will answer that to the best
 
02:29:17.469 --> 02:29:17.479 align:start position:0%
of my knowledge I don't see anybody from
 
02:29:19.550 --> 02:29:19.560 align:start position:0%
safety well they do but I they can
 
02:29:21.630 --> 02:29:21.640 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong the template we
 
02:29:23.429 --> 02:29:23.439 align:start position:0%
have right now for our driver's licenses
 
02:29:25.590 --> 02:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
is federal basically started with the
 
02:29:28.510 --> 02:29:28.520 align:start position:0%
real ID act uh and even though we did
 
02:29:30.429 --> 02:29:30.439 align:start position:0%
get um a carve out from the federal
 
02:29:32.750 --> 02:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
government to allow non-compliant
 
02:29:35.070 --> 02:29:35.080 align:start position:0%
licenses uh they still look and have the
 
02:29:38.630 --> 02:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
same template as the real ID so we can
 
02:29:41.269 --> 02:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
look into it but I don't know if that's
 
02:29:44.230 --> 02:29:44.240 align:start position:0%
possible represent I think there is a
 
02:29:45.790 --> 02:29:45.800 align:start position:0%
little bit thank you Mr chairman I think
 
02:29:46.990 --> 02:29:47.000 align:start position:0%
there is a little bit of a sense of that
 
02:29:48.309 --> 02:29:48.319 align:start position:0%
the water is already over the dam
 
02:29:50.630 --> 02:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
especially um where this would only
 
02:29:52.870 --> 02:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
apply for instate transactions if you've
 
02:29:54.070 --> 02:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
ever purchased anything online and
 
02:29:55.750 --> 02:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
they've required a picture of your your
 
02:29:57.429 --> 02:29:57.439 align:start position:0%
driver's license or any of information
 
02:29:59.269 --> 02:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
on the front of it they're not bound by
 
02:30:00.590 --> 02:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
our laws and I don't think there's a
 
02:30:04.230 --> 02:30:04.240 align:start position:0%
federal law prohibiting that um where I
 
02:30:06.110 --> 02:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
was wondering I think I agree with M
 
02:30:09.469 --> 02:30:09.479 align:start position:0%
with representative C is whether we can
 
02:30:13.469 --> 02:30:13.479 align:start position:0%
limit what information from from the ID
 
02:30:17.070 --> 02:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
is accessible to different organizations
 
02:30:19.469 --> 02:30:19.479 align:start position:0%
uh whether if you're buying alcohol that
 
02:30:21.190 --> 02:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
when they scan your your ID your name
 
02:30:23.309 --> 02:30:23.319 align:start position:0%
and and age your B date of birth shows
 
02:30:25.510 --> 02:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
up no other information so there's no
 
02:30:27.950 --> 02:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
access to that to allow them to store
 
02:30:29.910 --> 02:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
anything else your white weight anything
 
02:30:31.790 --> 02:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
like that so
 
02:30:34.590 --> 02:30:34.600 align:start position:0%
that's I think something that might be
 
02:30:36.990 --> 02:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
more applicable for us to be able to to
 
02:30:39.150 --> 02:30:39.160 align:start position:0%
enforce no and thank you it's another
 
02:30:42.230 --> 02:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
angle getting back to the scanning for
 
02:30:44.030 --> 02:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
retail the the cigarettes and the beer
 
02:30:45.790 --> 02:30:45.800 align:start position:0%
and whatever the other thing that I've
 
02:30:49.230 --> 02:30:49.240 align:start position:0%
noticed since uh I've seen this being
 
02:30:52.030 --> 02:30:52.040 align:start position:0%
adopted by a lot of Corporations I mean
 
02:30:53.389 --> 02:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
I won't mention anybody name and give
 
02:30:56.190 --> 02:30:56.200 align:start position:0%
them give them the notoriety but it
 
02:30:57.750 --> 02:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
seems like the clerks or the
 
02:30:59.790 --> 02:30:59.800 align:start position:0%
tellers they're not even looking at the
 
02:30:59.800 --> 02:31:00.630 align:start position:0%
tellers they're not even looking at the
picture

02:31:00.630 --> 02:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
picture
 
02:31:03.110 --> 02:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
anymore there is nothing in these these
 
02:31:04.750 --> 02:31:04.760 align:start position:0%
this bill or this amendment that says
 
02:31:06.830 --> 02:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
that you they can't ask you for good
 
02:31:09.349 --> 02:31:09.359 align:start position:0%
cause to inspect your license and when
 
02:31:10.550 --> 02:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
that happens you're supposed to be
 
02:31:12.510 --> 02:31:12.520 align:start position:0%
looking at their face and their date of
 
02:31:13.910 --> 02:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
birth and making sure that this is
 
02:31:15.950 --> 02:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
actually the person they don't even look
 
02:31:18.150 --> 02:31:18.160 align:start position:0%
at face anymore they're not even looking
 
02:31:19.790 --> 02:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
at the license anymore they take it out
 
02:31:21.790 --> 02:31:21.800 align:start position:0%
of your hand they sometimes they don't
 
02:31:23.070 --> 02:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
even take it out of your hand they scan
 
02:31:25.630 --> 02:31:25.640 align:start position:0%
it through the plexiglass so really I
 
02:31:27.150 --> 02:31:27.160 align:start position:0%
could go in there with my mother's ID
 
02:31:29.030 --> 02:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
and buy a sixpack and nobody would ever
 
02:31:30.469 --> 02:31:30.479 align:start position:0%
know the difference how do we even allow
 
02:31:32.269 --> 02:31:32.279 align:start position:0%
them to have access to that information
 
02:31:35.190 --> 02:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
through a scanner right well how do how
 
02:31:36.630 --> 02:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
do they how can they buy a scanner and
 
02:31:38.429 --> 02:31:38.439 align:start position:0%
have access to that database to begin
 
02:31:40.230 --> 02:31:40.240 align:start position:0%
with who controls that well again I
 
02:31:43.150 --> 02:31:43.160 align:start position:0%
don't know uh if you look 255 is an
 
02:31:43.160 --> 02:31:44.150 align:start position:0%
don't know uh if you look 255 is an
interesting

02:31:44.150 --> 02:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
02:31:46.910 --> 02:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
read um I I recommend that right after
 
02:31:48.469 --> 02:31:48.479 align:start position:0%
you get down R say
 
02:31:51.349 --> 02:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
2614 uh but there are a lot lot of new
 
02:31:53.550 --> 02:31:53.560 align:start position:0%
definitions on controllers and and and
 
02:31:55.230 --> 02:31:55.240 align:start position:0%
you know who working for the
 
02:31:57.190 --> 02:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
corporations gets to set these rules and
 
02:31:59.349 --> 02:31:59.359 align:start position:0%
what they do with it
 
02:32:02.070 --> 02:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
um I'm starting to get a sense that we
 
02:32:04.269 --> 02:32:04.279 align:start position:0%
get this but representative SES did you
 
02:32:04.279 --> 02:32:06.309 align:start position:0%
get this but representative SES did you
have

02:32:06.309 --> 02:32:06.319 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:32:09.469 --> 02:32:09.479 align:start position:0%
something well you know I've spent a lot
 
02:32:11.910 --> 02:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
of time and energy with former state
 
02:32:15.950 --> 02:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
representative Neil Kirk from where try
 
02:32:22.309 --> 02:32:22.319 align:start position:0%
exact L um trying to uh protect person's
 
02:32:25.429 --> 02:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
uh information the cruxs of the matter
 
02:32:28.830 --> 02:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
from my perspective about this is that I
 
02:32:32.110 --> 02:32:32.120 align:start position:0%
don't have a problem if people
 
02:32:35.190 --> 02:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
businesses whomever asks for the
 
02:32:37.269 --> 02:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
information I don't have a problem with
 
02:32:40.590 --> 02:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
that the problem I have is storage and
 
02:32:43.110 --> 02:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
where it gets sent afterwards and I
 
02:32:46.389 --> 02:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
don't think this bill as we have it or
 
02:32:49.110 --> 02:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
or even the amendment as we have it
 
02:32:51.910 --> 02:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
really addresses that more significant
 
02:32:55.510 --> 02:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
aspect to the problem uh so it's really
 
02:32:57.349 --> 02:32:57.359 align:start position:0%
hard to support the bill and it's really
 
02:32:59.150 --> 02:32:59.160 align:start position:0%
hard to support the amendment because it
 
02:33:01.429 --> 02:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't fix the real problem the real
 
02:33:05.550 --> 02:33:05.560 align:start position:0%
problem is what to do what they do with
 
02:33:08.750 --> 02:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
your information after they see
 
02:33:13.150 --> 02:33:13.160 align:start position:0%
it what I I understand the
 
02:33:16.230 --> 02:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
concern I that's my point we don't all
 
02:33:20.590 --> 02:33:20.600 align:start position:0%
always know um so it's really hard you
 
02:33:23.309 --> 02:33:23.319 align:start position:0%
know to to to and and for that matter
 
02:33:26.389 --> 02:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
there's a technical issue too t uh Mr
 
02:33:28.910 --> 02:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
chairman with your Amendment because
 
02:33:35.750 --> 02:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
there is no I that I can find 507 DH
 
02:33:39.750 --> 02:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
colon you know there is no 507 H that I
 
02:33:42.870 --> 02:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
can find so the the languages in your
 
02:33:47.550 --> 02:33:47.560 align:start position:0%
amendment is got a problem
 
02:33:49.269 --> 02:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
anyway that's that's sort of where I'm
 
02:33:51.870 --> 02:33:51.880 align:start position:0%
at yeah you want to ask me
 
02:33:55.269 --> 02:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
sure represent Mr chairman if you don't
 
02:33:58.070 --> 02:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
mind what did you have a that he asked a
 
02:33:59.510 --> 02:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
question oh no that's where I was going
 
02:34:00.510 --> 02:34:00.520 align:start position:0%
representative Hill did you have a
 
02:34:02.590 --> 02:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
question I do
 
02:34:06.230 --> 02:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
um I understand the storage um concern
 
02:34:08.550 --> 02:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
that you have do you have a concern as
 
02:34:13.070 --> 02:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
well of um denying service if you don't
 
02:34:16.510 --> 02:34:16.520 align:start position:0%
comply with the um with the Turney over
 
02:34:19.230 --> 02:34:19.240 align:start position:0%
of the license well I think we've had
 
02:34:21.469 --> 02:34:21.479 align:start position:0%
lots of CA court cases where businesses
 
02:34:23.349 --> 02:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
are allowed to deny service for a
 
02:34:25.990 --> 02:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
variety of reasons and I don't see how
 
02:34:28.790 --> 02:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
we can get in get into that you know
 
02:34:31.349 --> 02:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
particularly but we as individuals have
 
02:34:35.110 --> 02:34:35.120 align:start position:0%
a choice to not comply with their
 
02:34:37.190 --> 02:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
request and they have businesses have
 
02:34:38.630 --> 02:34:38.640 align:start position:0%
the right to say well we're not going to
 
02:34:40.910 --> 02:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
do business with you
 
02:34:43.150 --> 02:34:43.160 align:start position:0%
uh one way or the other there are lots
 
02:34:44.990 --> 02:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
of businesses who make determinations
 
02:34:46.910 --> 02:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
that they won't do business
 
02:34:49.750 --> 02:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
with whatever
 
02:34:52.110 --> 02:34:52.120 align:start position:0%
whomever but this and not to be
 
02:34:53.630 --> 02:34:53.640 align:start position:0%
argumentative this doesn't have to be
 
02:34:56.309 --> 02:34:56.319 align:start position:0%
one of those but um uh well let's look
 
02:34:57.790 --> 02:34:57.800 align:start position:0%
at the reality of this I'll get a couple
 
02:35:00.070 --> 02:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
more questions I I I I'm getting the
 
02:35:03.150 --> 02:35:03.160 align:start position:0%
sense from the committee that we kind of
 
02:35:04.150 --> 02:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
get the
 
02:35:06.590 --> 02:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
idea but I also have to be the first to
 
02:35:08.550 --> 02:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
admit I don't think we're
 
02:35:11.910 --> 02:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
there we have till the 21st of March to
 
02:35:14.990 --> 02:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
report out on this that gives us two
 
02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:18.190 align:start position:0%
report out on this that gives us two
weeks

02:35:18.190 --> 02:35:18.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:19.870 --> 02:35:19.880 align:start position:0%
I'll ask a couple more questions who had
 
02:35:22.190 --> 02:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
your hand represent
 
02:35:26.269 --> 02:35:26.279 align:start position:0%
pondon thank you Mr chair um I think
 
02:35:28.230 --> 02:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
your your amendment is on the right path
 
02:35:31.030 --> 02:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
so I do concur with that uh and I concur
 
02:35:32.510 --> 02:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
with a lot of the sentiment that has
 
02:35:35.389 --> 02:35:35.399 align:start position:0%
made thus far especially regarding
 
02:35:37.590 --> 02:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
storage my concern and I want to make
 
02:35:39.790 --> 02:35:39.800 align:start position:0%
sure it's clear that this is for
 
02:35:43.190 --> 02:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
purchasing at retail uh whereas there's
 
02:35:45.950 --> 02:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
a distinct distinction between
 
02:35:49.389 --> 02:35:49.399 align:start position:0%
purchasing and leasing at retail Leasing
 
02:35:52.630 --> 02:35:52.640 align:start position:0%
and I want to then line 11 does state
 
02:35:56.150 --> 02:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
retail sale of goods and services and by
 
02:35:58.750 --> 02:35:58.760 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure in legal ease that
 
02:36:01.309 --> 02:36:01.319 align:start position:0%
covers just the purchasing aspect and
 
02:36:04.469 --> 02:36:04.479 align:start position:0%
would not affect uh leasing at retail
 
02:36:07.230 --> 02:36:07.240 align:start position:0%
you mentioned uh Comcast uh some of that
 
02:36:10.110 --> 02:36:10.120 align:start position:0%
equipment they're over $1,000 a piece so
 
02:36:12.670 --> 02:36:12.680 align:start position:0%
I can see the justification of getting
 
02:36:13.910 --> 02:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
some kind of
 
02:36:17.389 --> 02:36:17.399 align:start position:0%
information uh from a customer because
 
02:36:20.309 --> 02:36:20.319 align:start position:0%
it's their equipment that's going out
 
02:36:22.670 --> 02:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
it's the same with retail as well U they
 
02:36:24.550 --> 02:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
use it anti fraud you know I know
 
02:36:25.830 --> 02:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of that stuff going on in
 
02:36:28.269 --> 02:36:28.279 align:start position:0%
our country today and again that's
 
02:36:29.550 --> 02:36:29.560 align:start position:0%
that's why I've been trying to narrow it
 
02:36:32.309 --> 02:36:32.319 align:start position:0%
down before we continue I I think we're
 
02:36:34.030 --> 02:36:34.040 align:start position:0%
looking down the road of an interm study
 
02:36:37.990 --> 02:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:42.710 --> 02:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
mistaken no okay that being said it's
 
02:36:45.110 --> 02:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
unfortunate but there's a lot of moving
 
02:36:46.630 --> 02:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
parts to this so
 
02:36:50.510 --> 02:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
so be yet um I know a few of us need to
 
02:36:53.469 --> 02:36:53.479 align:start position:0%
go to a different thing at noon we've
 
02:36:56.150 --> 02:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
got some scheduling at 1:00 that we've
 
02:36:58.750 --> 02:36:58.760 align:start position:0%
got to figure out what to do we've got
 
02:37:01.349 --> 02:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
the exact session that we could do on
 
02:37:02.790 --> 02:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
three of them that's that we've already
 
02:37:04.990 --> 02:37:05.000 align:start position:0%
tackled so far with our recommendations
 
02:37:07.230 --> 02:37:07.240 align:start position:0%
that should be pretty much

03:51:38.149 --> 03:51:38.159 align:start position:0%

to the protection of personal
 
03:56:25.070 --> 03:56:25.080 align:start position:0%
information in driver's
 
03:56:36.349 --> 03:56:36.359 align:start position:0%

03:56:51.630 --> 03:56:51.640 align:start position:0%
motion yes thank you um I think there's
 
03:56:53.229 --> 03:56:53.239 align:start position:0%
a lot of good intent behind this bill
 
03:56:54.710 --> 03:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
and I think there's some pieces that we
 
03:56:57.790 --> 03:56:57.800 align:start position:0%
all agree on uh just do we have the time
 
03:57:00.070 --> 03:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
to to work through it and make sure it's
 
03:57:02.710 --> 03:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
uh ready for prime time as they say um
 
03:57:04.269 --> 03:57:04.279 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to take a little more time
 
03:57:07.349 --> 03:57:07.359 align:start position:0%
and uh sincerely work on it over the
 
03:57:11.710 --> 03:57:11.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:15.550 --> 03:57:15.560 align:start position:0%
can thank you anybody else from the
 
03:57:17.389 --> 03:57:17.399 align:start position:0%
committee I'll just say a couple of
 
03:57:20.349 --> 03:57:20.359 align:start position:0%
words um put a tremendous amount of time
 
03:57:21.510 --> 03:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
into this so
 
03:57:24.309 --> 03:57:24.319 align:start position:0%
far as I said in our work session I
 
03:57:25.550 --> 03:57:25.560 align:start position:0%
don't think I can actually duplicate
 
03:57:26.830 --> 03:57:26.840 align:start position:0%
what I said then
 
03:57:29.790 --> 03:57:29.800 align:start position:0%
but uh in spite of all the work that's
 
03:57:32.030 --> 03:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
put in and and thanks to the office of
 
03:57:35.110 --> 03:57:35.120 align:start position:0%
legislative Service as well uh I find
 
03:57:37.790 --> 03:57:37.800 align:start position:0%
we're just not there yet if I thought it
 
03:57:39.189 --> 03:57:39.199 align:start position:0%
was something I could accomplish in the
 
03:57:40.710 --> 03:57:40.720 align:start position:0%
next two weeks before our deadline I
 
03:57:43.510 --> 03:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
would not take it up today but I'm being
 
03:57:48.110 --> 03:57:48.120 align:start position:0%
realistic and stand here defeated so uh
 
03:57:51.790 --> 03:57:51.800 align:start position:0%
I do also support the interim study and
 
03:57:54.429 --> 03:57:54.439 align:start position:0%
there's always next year anybody else
 
03:57:55.670 --> 03:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
from the
 
03:57:57.670 --> 03:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
03:58:00.590 --> 03:58:00.600 align:start position:0%
sers thanks thank you Mr chair I am
 
03:58:03.189 --> 03:58:03.199 align:start position:0%
going to oppose the inter study
 
03:58:05.750 --> 03:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
I we can't keep kicking this down the
 
03:58:08.830 --> 03:58:08.840 align:start position:0%
road this is our private personal
 
03:58:11.309 --> 03:58:11.319 align:start position:0%
information and it's like we got to deal
 
03:58:13.870 --> 03:58:13.880 align:start position:0%
with at least something and there's no
 
03:58:15.389 --> 03:58:15.399 align:start position:0%
reason why we can't at least tell the
 
03:58:18.750 --> 03:58:18.760 align:start position:0%
retailers stop scanning the licenses and
 
03:58:21.030 --> 03:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
give them a fine if they do and give
 
03:58:23.389 --> 03:58:23.399 align:start position:0%
some teeth behind this you know this one
 
03:58:25.750 --> 03:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
small part of the bill because it's
 
03:58:27.510 --> 03:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
getting ridiculous out there they're
 
03:58:29.030 --> 03:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
taking our information we don't even
 
03:58:30.790 --> 03:58:30.800 align:start position:0%
know what they're doing with them you
 
03:58:33.710 --> 03:58:33.720 align:start position:0%
know I don't want my my hair color my
 
03:58:35.269 --> 03:58:35.279 align:start position:0%
height my weight out there and
 
03:58:36.590 --> 03:58:36.600 align:start position:0%
everything else I mean why should they
 
03:58:39.030 --> 03:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
even have that and today everything
 
03:58:42.309 --> 03:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
today is data is King I mean it's like
 
03:58:44.070 --> 03:58:44.080 align:start position:0%
gold it's like the new gold and it's
 
03:58:45.830 --> 03:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
like we got to stop this and I think we
 
03:58:48.590 --> 03:58:48.600 align:start position:0%
should try to push forward in the next
 
03:58:50.389 --> 03:58:50.399 align:start position:0%
week and a week and a half have
 
03:58:53.070 --> 03:58:53.080 align:start position:0%
something Rewritten very in clear
 
03:58:55.189 --> 03:58:55.199 align:start position:0%
English that will stop the retailers
 
03:58:58.990 --> 03:58:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:01.590 --> 03:59:01.600 align:start position:0%
information representative Hill thank
 
03:59:03.269 --> 03:59:03.279 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I don't disagree with
 
03:59:07.429 --> 03:59:07.439 align:start position:0%
chairman sers and uh and I thought if um
 
03:59:10.389 --> 03:59:10.399 align:start position:0%
he wanted to take a uh a couple weeks
 
03:59:14.469 --> 03:59:14.479 align:start position:0%
with a with a subcommittee he um and
 
03:59:16.309 --> 03:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
then we come back and interim study at
 
03:59:18.630 --> 03:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
that point I don't know that there's a
 
03:59:21.950 --> 03:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
harm in that um if he wanted to
 
03:59:26.630 --> 03:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
try um and put together some kind of
 
03:59:30.070 --> 03:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
a um simplified version dealing strictly
 
03:59:31.510 --> 03:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
with retail
 
03:59:33.990 --> 03:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
operations um it may be something that
 
03:59:36.389 --> 03:59:36.399 align:start position:0%
the committee would want to entertain
 
03:59:42.309 --> 03:59:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:45.389 --> 03:59:45.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:47.870 --> 03:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
03:59:53.149 --> 03:59:53.159 align:start position:0%
s so I I've long been a supporter of
 
03:59:55.389 --> 03:59:55.399 align:start position:0%
protecting personal information and as I
 
03:59:58.070 --> 03:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
said earlier during our work session
 
04:00:01.670 --> 04:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
that it's important for us to recognize
 
04:00:04.269 --> 04:00:04.279 align:start position:0%
that uh businesses have the right to ask
 
04:00:06.469 --> 04:00:06.479 align:start position:0%
for this data but in my opinion they
 
04:00:08.149 --> 04:00:08.159 align:start position:0%
don't have the right to send that data
 
04:00:12.149 --> 04:00:12.159 align:start position:0%
around somebody else by keeping it um
 
04:00:15.469 --> 04:00:15.479 align:start position:0%
but it is a complicated thorny issue
 
04:00:20.189 --> 04:00:20.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:22.990 --> 04:00:23.000 align:start position:0%
deserves us not to rush on it because
 
04:00:26.269 --> 04:00:26.279 align:start position:0%
when we when we rush legislation then we
 
04:00:27.750 --> 04:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
make mistakes
 
04:00:29.830 --> 04:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
unintentionally we make mistakes but
 
04:00:32.550 --> 04:00:32.560 align:start position:0%
nevertheless we often make mistakes I
 
04:00:34.469 --> 04:00:34.479 align:start position:0%
don't want to make mistakes with this
 
04:00:37.670 --> 04:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
because this is a really important issue
 
04:00:39.750 --> 04:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
important to to our constituents
 
04:00:42.550 --> 04:00:42.560 align:start position:0%
important to businesses important in so
 
04:00:45.590 --> 04:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
many different ways and I think we have
 
04:00:47.990 --> 04:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
shown as a committee that we can work
 
04:00:51.309 --> 04:00:51.319 align:start position:0%
together in order to try and find
 
04:00:51.319 --> 04:00:52.830 align:start position:0%
together in order to try and find
just

04:00:52.830 --> 04:00:52.840 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:00:56.630 --> 04:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
applicable reasonable solutions to the
 
04:00:59.830 --> 04:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
the the questions that present to us in
 
04:01:04.070 --> 04:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
this body and this issue deserves all of
 
04:01:04.080 --> 04:01:07.229 align:start position:0%
this body and this issue deserves all of
those

04:01:07.229 --> 04:01:07.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:07.239 --> 04:01:09.429 align:start position:0%
 
things

04:01:09.429 --> 04:01:09.439 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:01:09.439 --> 04:01:11.630 align:start position:0%
things
anybody

04:01:11.630 --> 04:01:11.640 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
04:01:14.429 --> 04:01:14.439 align:start position:0%
else I find myself in a terrible
 
04:01:16.670 --> 04:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
situation um usually I work with my
 
04:01:18.830 --> 04:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
ranking member and try to come to
 
04:01:21.309 --> 04:01:21.319 align:start position:0%
agreements before these uh we even get
 
04:01:24.269 --> 04:01:24.279 align:start position:0%
to this point and I did say I would
 
04:01:26.790 --> 04:01:26.800 align:start position:0%
probably go along with the interim
 
04:01:30.469 --> 04:01:30.479 align:start position:0%
study only because I have been battling
 
04:01:33.309 --> 04:01:33.319 align:start position:0%
with this for well over a
 
04:01:36.229 --> 04:01:36.239 align:start position:0%
month but I have to be honest with you
 
04:01:39.030 --> 04:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh that representative of sellers brings
 
04:01:42.229 --> 04:01:42.239 align:start position:0%
up a very good point at what
 
04:01:45.790 --> 04:01:45.800 align:start position:0%
point and we um we are coming back
 
04:01:48.269 --> 04:01:48.279 align:start position:0%
anyway we actually do have a pretty good
 
04:01:49.870 --> 04:01:49.880 align:start position:0%
starting point in the amendment that
 
04:01:53.630 --> 04:01:53.640 align:start position:0%
I've got and you know what with all all
 
04:01:56.710 --> 04:01:56.720 align:start position:0%
due respect and apologies I'm going to
 
04:01:58.750 --> 04:01:58.760 align:start position:0%
ask the committee my recommendation to
 
04:02:01.149 --> 04:02:01.159 align:start position:0%
vote down the interim study so that we
 
04:02:03.830 --> 04:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
can take this bill up in a few more
 
04:02:07.149 --> 04:02:07.159 align:start position:0%
weeks anybody else anybody else from the
 
04:02:09.469 --> 04:02:09.479 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none I'll ask the clerk
