that
 
00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:11.440 align:start position:0%

on factual matters and
 
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:18.480 align:start position:0%

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:20.160 align:start position:0%

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:33.360 align:start position:0%

the bell system spent about 12 years

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:14.480 align:start position:0%

which has been bought out by another
 
00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:31.200 align:start position:0%

another company
 
00:23:36.149 --> 00:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
so let's still consider myself a bell
 
00:23:38.549 --> 00:23:38.559 align:start position:0%
system person
 
00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
i spent about 50 years
 
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
in addition to that either as a
 
00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.510 align:start position:0%
in addition to that either as a
selectmen

00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:45.520 align:start position:0%

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:48.960 align:start position:0%

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:53.360 align:start position:0%

or as a elected state rep
 
00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:00.799 align:start position:0%
and i've enjoyed them all and
 
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
like as susan told you we both came in
 
00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
at the same time
 
00:24:08.549 --> 00:24:08.559 align:start position:0%
13 times ago and i spent most of my time
 
00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
in boys and men's
 
00:24:14.789 --> 00:24:14.799 align:start position:0%
and susan and i we rotate all the time
 
00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
whenever the democrats are in the
 
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
majority she
 
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
chairs and republicans are in a majority
 
00:24:21.269 --> 00:24:21.279 align:start position:0%
high chair
 
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
but we work with each other you know we
 
00:24:24.789 --> 00:24:24.799 align:start position:0%
have different
 
00:24:27.669 --> 00:24:27.679 align:start position:0%
political beliefs and we we stay with
 
00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:29.039 align:start position:0%
those beliefs
 
00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
but we can still work with each other we
 
00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
always try to find
 
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
common ground because to be an effective
 
00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
legislator you have to know how to
 
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
communicate negotiate and compromise
 
00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
you can't do that you really shouldn't
 
00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
be here but there's so many
 
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
that are in the legislature that has not
 
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
learned that
 
00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
so i hope we all continue this
 
00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
because we were the only committee
 
00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
that met remotely at unh
 
00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
i got a vote that was like what 315
 
00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
to five when we met
 
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
at unh on our revenue estimates
 
00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
everything else is a complete chaos
 
00:25:22.149 --> 00:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
battle everything i mean this strictly
 
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
political down the line
 
00:25:27.269 --> 00:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
but as it's been said
 
00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
as jesus has said we deal on facts and
 
00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
we try to stay with those facts
 
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
and throughout the committee
 
00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
i will make sure that each and every one
 
00:25:45.669 --> 00:25:45.679 align:start position:0%
of you participate
 
00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
because if you don't participate you
 
00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
don't learn anything you just sit there
 
00:25:50.789 --> 00:25:50.799 align:start position:0%
and listen
 
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
so you'll see me okay mary
 
00:25:58.710 --> 00:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
what do you think where is this going to
 
00:25:58.720 --> 00:25:59.909 align:start position:0%
what do you think where is this going to
go

00:25:59.909 --> 00:25:59.919 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
and there is no such thing as a
 
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
i know i'm rambling on there's no such
 
00:26:07.909 --> 00:26:07.919 align:start position:0%
thing as a dumb question
 
00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
there's a question bring it out because
 
00:26:12.549 --> 00:26:12.559 align:start position:0%
somebody else probably wanted to say it
 
00:26:12.559 --> 00:26:13.430 align:start position:0%
somebody else probably wanted to say it
too

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
too
 
00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
but thank god you said it all right i
 
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
think we need to get into the program
 
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.350 align:start position:0%
think we need to get into the program
now

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:24.559 align:start position:0%
we were given an organization uh
 
00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
shoot the committee purpose and all that
 
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
and i'll just quickly run down this
 
00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
the committee purpose is to examine and
 
00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
consider the state of the treasury
 
00:26:42.149 --> 00:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
also to consider and report on all bills
 
00:26:43.669 --> 00:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
and resolutions
 
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
relating to money by state taxes
 
00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
fees or other methods of raising state
 
00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:51.110 align:start position:0%
fees or other methods of raising state
funds

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
and other matters referring to it
 
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
and report to the house in the form of
 
00:26:57.909 --> 00:26:57.919 align:start position:0%
house resolution
 
00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
and estimates of state revenues
 
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
so we have two major jobs
 
00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
there are other committees normally just
 
00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:10.400 align:start position:0%
contend with bills we have to contend
 
00:27:12.549 --> 00:27:12.559 align:start position:0%
with the bills that are before us
 
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
as well as revenue estimates
 
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
the other day as i looked and we had 10
 
00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:21.269 align:start position:0%
the other day as i looked and we had 10
bills

00:27:21.269 --> 00:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
i looked this morning now we have 21
 
00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.269 align:start position:0%
i looked this morning now we have 21
days

00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
days
 
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
and look later on this week we'll
 
00:27:30.549 --> 00:27:30.559 align:start position:0%
probably do more than that
 
00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
and we have to determine on these bills
 
00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
which are the early
 
00:27:36.549 --> 00:27:36.559 align:start position:0%
bills and which of the late bills and
 
00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
those early bills we don't have much
 
00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:38.630 align:start position:0%
those early bills we don't have much
time

00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
to get them out the early bills i
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
believe have to be out
 
00:27:56.789 --> 00:27:56.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:58.950 --> 00:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
the first thing we need to do is to do
 
00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
the revenue estimates
 
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
none of us can do the revenue estimates
 
00:28:04.389 --> 00:28:04.399 align:start position:0%
not even
 
00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
the people who have been pretty long
 
00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:08.710 align:start position:0%
the people who have been pretty long
time

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
until we re-educate ourselves
 
00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
so as you know in the calendar we have a
 
00:28:16.549 --> 00:28:16.559 align:start position:0%
hybrid arrangement
 
00:28:18.789 --> 00:28:18.799 align:start position:0%
scheduled for next week it's called an
 
00:28:21.029 --> 00:28:21.039 align:start position:0%
economic update
 
00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
on that economic update the first day on
 
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
the 19th
 
00:28:27.669 --> 00:28:27.679 align:start position:0%
we'll be bringing in seven different
 
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
type of economies
 
00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
or experts relative to
 
00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
the process and the next day there will
 
00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
be six or seven
 
00:28:38.789 --> 00:28:38.799 align:start position:0%
more presenters and these presenters
 
00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
will all be
 
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
presenting virtually and we're scheduled
 
00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
to meet
 
00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
in the reps hall but we may change that
 
00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
because of what's going on right now we
 
00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:51.110 align:start position:0%
because of what's going on right now we
may

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
may
 
00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:59.350 --> 00:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
and i'll get into more of the schedule
 
00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:02.870 align:start position:0%
and i'll get into more of the schedule
later

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:06.789 --> 00:29:06.799 align:start position:0%
but after we spend next week
 
00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
with the economy the following week
 
00:29:12.149 --> 00:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
we'll spend a number of days with agency
 
00:29:12.159 --> 00:29:13.669 align:start position:0%
we'll spend a number of days with agency
heads

00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
heads
 
00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
the agency has that are responsible for
 
00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
different revenues we have new hampshire
 
00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:22.559 align:start position:0%
is unique
 
00:29:25.269 --> 00:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
you're a state that doesn't have we're
 
00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
the only state that doesn't have a
 
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
broad-based tax
 
00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
we don't have a base income tax and
 
00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:31.830 align:start position:0%
we don't have a base income tax and
broadband

00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
broadband
 
00:29:35.909 --> 00:29:35.919 align:start position:0%
sales tax we pay for our budget
 
00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
what i call a portfolio of taxes and
 
00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:40.149 align:start position:0%
what i call a portfolio of taxes and
fees

00:29:40.149 --> 00:29:40.159 align:start position:0%
fees
 
00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:47.039 align:start position:0%
and a whole lot of other things
 
00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
and these taxes and fees
 
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
are all controlled administration with
 
00:29:56.149 --> 00:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
them is controlled by
 
00:29:58.310 --> 00:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
various agencies we'll bring in these
 
00:29:59.350 --> 00:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
agency heads
 
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
and they'll tell us
 
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
what is the status of
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
say the rooms and meals tax what's the
 
00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:09.590 align:start position:0%
say the rooms and meals tax what's the
status

00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
status
 
00:30:13.029 --> 00:30:13.039 align:start position:0%
of the liquor
 
00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
and we'll spend a few days
 
00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
full days doing that
 
00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
because it will take us all that amount
 
00:30:29.029 --> 00:30:29.039 align:start position:0%
of time to get ready
 
00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
to generate our revenue estimates so
 
00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
that's the education process
 
00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
part of it i talked to the
 
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
chairman of the finance committee ken
 
00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:41.269 align:start position:0%
chairman of the finance committee ken
weiler

00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
weiler
 
00:30:42.789 --> 00:30:42.799 align:start position:0%
they're going to be getting the
 
00:30:42.799 --> 00:30:45.350 align:start position:0%
they're going to be getting the
governor's

00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:48.789 --> 00:30:48.799 align:start position:0%
budget on the 15th of february so we
 
00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
need to have
 
00:30:54.789 --> 00:30:54.799 align:start position:0%
our revenues to the house
 
00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
around that same time we talked 15th of
 
00:30:59.830 --> 00:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
february from now there's not much time
 
00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
and then also the i think it's
 
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
the following week you need to get the
 
00:31:09.269 --> 00:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
second the bills that go into the second
 
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
committee out
 
00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
so we're gonna have to be dealing with
 
00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
second committee bills while we're going
 
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
with revenue estimates
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
so we've got a lot of work ahead of us
 
00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
so those are our two main areas
 
00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
now the rules of the committee we have
 
00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
a committee meeting and it says eight
 
00:31:36.389 --> 00:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
o'clock or nine o'clock
 
00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
that means eight o'clock and then five
 
00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:47.029 --> 00:31:47.039 align:start position:0%
first thing is it's impolite
 
00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:49.919 align:start position:0%
to waste somebody's time that's there
 
00:31:49.919 --> 00:31:50.870 align:start position:0%
to waste somebody's time that's there
early

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
early
 
00:31:53.909 --> 00:31:53.919 align:start position:0%
because you decide for some maybe it
 
00:31:53.919 --> 00:31:54.630 align:start position:0%
because you decide for some maybe it
isn't

00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
but don't come late if you're gonna be
 
00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:58.310 align:start position:0%
but don't come late if you're gonna be
late

00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
late
 
00:32:00.789 --> 00:32:00.799 align:start position:0%
give me a call you're not going to show
 
00:32:02.549 --> 00:32:02.559 align:start position:0%
up with him in the fall
 
00:32:05.269 --> 00:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
so we know that you can get started with
 
00:32:05.279 --> 00:32:06.230 align:start position:0%
so we know that you can get started with
that

00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:10.710 align:start position:0%
that
knowledge

00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
now normally when we have public
 
00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:14.310 align:start position:0%
now normally when we have public
hearings

00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
there's no food or drink during the
 
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
public hand
 
00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
we're operating under emergency artists
 
00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
so it's extremely difficult to have
 
00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
public hearings the way he had before
 
00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:28.720 align:start position:0%
they're going to be
 
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
zoom type or hybrid type public hearings
 
00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
so we're going to have to
 
00:32:40.789 --> 00:32:40.799 align:start position:0%
work our way through this process
 
00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
it's a new process for all of us
 
00:32:47.909 --> 00:32:47.919 align:start position:0%
last year we were hit with this
 
00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
process the
 
00:32:54.149 --> 00:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
last day we had regular legislative
 
00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
meetings was the 12th of march
 
00:32:58.870 --> 00:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
since then the legislative office
 
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
building has been closed
 
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
i went to the legislative office
 
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
building yesterday
 
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
because my office was moving i had to
 
00:33:12.789 --> 00:33:12.799 align:start position:0%
make sure this stuff was
 
00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
we're still not going to be able to get
 
00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
back into our regular offices
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
what they're doing is they're going to
 
00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.710 align:start position:0%
what they're doing is they're going to
have

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:26.720 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
double rows so that we can maintain the
 
00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
six foot distance
 
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
they still have the face mask
 
00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
and yesterday they just came in they
 
00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:40.640 align:start position:0%
were delivered the air purifiers they're
 
00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
going to have these
 
00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
gigantic air purifiers to these double
 
00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:45.909 align:start position:0%
gigantic air purifiers to these double
rooms

00:33:45.909 --> 00:33:45.919 align:start position:0%
rooms
 
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
they can only make four double rooms per
 
00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.230 align:start position:0%
they can only make four double rooms per
floor

00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
floor
 
00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
so four double rooms before you're
 
00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:59.830 --> 00:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
eight committees can be meeting
 
00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:03.519 align:start position:0%
at once so rather than meeting normally
 
00:34:05.909 --> 00:34:05.919 align:start position:0%

what those dates are yet
 
00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
because things haven't been worked out
 
00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
the bills that that this came in the 21
 
00:34:27.839 --> 00:34:28.950 align:start position:0%
the bills that that this came in the 21
bills

00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how many of those are going
 
00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:44.230 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:46.069 --> 00:34:46.079 align:start position:0%
the second committee bills are due the
 
00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
18th of february
 
00:34:53.430 --> 00:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:56.720 align:start position:0%
on the 16th of february
 
00:34:59.430 --> 00:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
we don't have much time so we have a lot
 
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
next week is the 19th and 20th
 
00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
where we're going to have the economic
 
00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:11.430 align:start position:0%
where we're going to have the economic
update

00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
update
 
00:35:13.109 --> 00:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
the following week is going to have the
 
00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
agency heads come in
 
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
in the following two weeks we're going
 
00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:18.470 align:start position:0%
in the following two weeks we're going
to

00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:35:21.829 --> 00:35:21.839 align:start position:0%
have work sessions
 
00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
where we debate get our questions
 
00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:27.190 align:start position:0%
where we debate get our questions
answered

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
answered
 
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
i'm only hoping that the early bills
 
00:35:37.589 --> 00:35:37.599 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
there's only just a few of them and the
 
00:35:41.109 --> 00:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
both of them
 
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
could become could come in later
 
00:35:47.349 --> 00:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
and the rest of the bills
 
00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:57.990 --> 00:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
of march so that gives a lot a lot more
 
00:36:00.069 --> 00:36:00.079 align:start position:0%
time the 25th of march
 
00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:07.589 --> 00:36:07.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:10.829 --> 00:36:10.839 align:start position:0%
and every bill has to have a public
 
00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
hearing and usually
 
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
after public hearing there's a lot of
 
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
questions if there's a lot of questions
 
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
then we'll put then we need to sign
 
00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:22.310 align:start position:0%
then we'll put then we need to sign
subcommittees

00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
subcommittees
 
00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
usually we run maybe about four
 
00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:27.670 align:start position:0%
usually we run maybe about four
subcommittees

00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
subcommittees
 
00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
and then the subcommittee chair uh
 
00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
signing subtle committee chairs and i
 
00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
try to balance it out
 
00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
by them have proponents and opponents
 
00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
on the subcommittee so that
 
00:36:50.069 --> 00:36:50.079 align:start position:0%
both sides of the issue can be debated
 
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
and then after the sub committee meet
 
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
they can also
 
00:36:59.670 --> 00:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
bring in people to ask questions
 
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
they can act like a regular committee
 
00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
and then they
 
00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
they also have to have their hearings
 
00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:10.640 align:start position:0%
notice there's a 24-hour notice versus
 
00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
the very little committee needs to be
 
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
noticed a week ahead of time
 
00:37:19.829 --> 00:37:19.839 align:start position:0%
then when the subcommittee finishes
 
00:37:21.109 --> 00:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
their work
 
00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
you get together as a full committee
 
00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
again and then
 
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
we exact hopefully everybody can take
 
00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
part in that exactly
 
00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
you know that you're not going to be
 
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
there without that
 
00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
minority leader which would be
 
00:37:41.349 --> 00:37:41.359 align:start position:0%
citizen or myself as a majority
 
00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
leader for the uh republicans you know
 
00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
so that we can get a replacement so we
 
00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:47.910 align:start position:0%
so that we can get a replacement so we
have

00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
a low compliment the republican
 
00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
democrats would be able
 
00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
now you can read through the sheets that
 
00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:03.589 align:start position:0%
now you can read through the sheets that
i

00:38:03.589 --> 00:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:38:07.349 --> 00:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
sent you to karen or
 
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
jen all the things that
 
00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
one of the things is that you're a
 
00:38:21.349 --> 00:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
sponsor or co-sponsor of a bill
 
00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
before the committee this
 
00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:28.230 align:start position:0%
before the committee this
sponsor

00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
cannot or and the co-sponsor cannot ask
 
00:38:35.109 --> 00:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
questions of the person that's
 
00:38:35.119 --> 00:38:36.470 align:start position:0%
questions of the person that's
testifying

00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
they have to sit back to the people
 
00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
and then they they can be they can
 
00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:58.630 --> 00:38:58.640 align:start position:0%
i notice i put a lot of items there but
 
00:38:59.270 --> 00:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
they're all
 
00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:03.589 align:start position:0%
they're all
important

00:39:03.589 --> 00:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:11.109 --> 00:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
vote on the bill an exec session
 
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
there's two types of calendars you can
 
00:39:15.829 --> 00:39:15.839 align:start position:0%
go on you can go on the regular calendar
 
00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
or you can go on the consent calendar
 
00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar means that it's a
 
00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
bill that usually comes out of committee
 
00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:26.240 align:start position:0%
during the anonymous vote
 
00:39:30.069 --> 00:39:30.079 align:start position:0%
if it's a unanimous vote and it
 
00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't do with raising revenues
 
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
and you can vote to go on the consent
 
00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:37.670 align:start position:0%
and you can vote to go on the consent
calendar

00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
and all the consent calendars when they
 
00:39:41.829 --> 00:39:41.839 align:start position:0%
go to the full house
 
00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
will be voted on by one vote
 
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
unless some of them have been taken off
 
00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
now one person in the committee objects
 
00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
to having it on consent and they want
 
00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
to go in the regular calendar so it can
 
00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
be debated
 
00:39:59.109 --> 00:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
then that's what it would be it will not
 
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
be any consent
 
00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
but you'll learn these things as you go
 
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
the subcommittees
 
00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
you'll all have an opportunity to sign
 
00:40:14.309 --> 00:40:14.319 align:start position:0%
up for whatsapp community that you want
 
00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure it's balanced
 
00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:18.309 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure it's balanced
though

00:40:18.309 --> 00:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
though
 
00:40:19.589 --> 00:40:19.599 align:start position:0%
and if you're not assigned to a
 
00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and sub community
 
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
holds a hearing you can still go to that
 
00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
um there's one other thing
 
00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
next week it's scheduled to hold the
 
00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:39.270 align:start position:0%
next week it's scheduled to hold the
meeting

00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
and reps hall of the joint
 
00:40:47.349 --> 00:40:47.359 align:start position:0%
senate and house members
 
00:40:52.309 --> 00:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
and unless individual members want to
 
00:40:56.309 --> 00:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
you get into rep paul you can only do it
 
00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
two ways
 
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
one is into the state house
 
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
from park state on the side entrance
 
00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
will provide the security people the
 
00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
names of the committee members
 
00:41:19.829 --> 00:41:19.839 align:start position:0%
so that when you go in the name will be
 
00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:22.720 align:start position:0%
there and they'll check the temperature
 
00:41:25.829 --> 00:41:25.839 align:start position:0%
and that so allow you to come in
 
00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
the other way is to go into the
 
00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:32.000 align:start position:0%

00:44:17.589 --> 00:44:17.599 align:start position:0%
i assume
 
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
okay so mostly everybody received this
 
00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
about half looks like
 
00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
well um both of them
 
00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
yes fantasy
 
00:44:42.069 --> 00:44:42.079 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot there
 
00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
i i can go through every every single
 
00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
line right now
 
00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
but and basically it's the rules of the
 
00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
operation of the committee under the new
 
00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:54.230 align:start position:0%
operation of the committee under the new
chair

00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
it's the same rules that we've been
 
00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
operating under for
 
00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
one of the most important things is
 
00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
especially for the new people
 
00:45:11.109 --> 00:45:11.119 align:start position:0%
when somebody's up there testifying and
 
00:45:11.119 --> 00:45:11.510 align:start position:0%
when somebody's up there testifying and
you

00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
completely disagree with them
 
00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
you don't disagree with them from the
 
00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:18.550 align:start position:0%
you don't disagree with them from the
chair

00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:45:21.349 --> 00:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
we're there to get testimony we're here
 
00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
we're here
 
00:45:25.349 --> 00:45:25.359 align:start position:0%
to listen girls or giving testimony
 
00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
right now ask questions but we don't
 
00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
debate them
 
00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
nor nor do we make our own home
 
00:45:38.069 --> 00:45:38.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:40.720 align:start position:0%
otherwise you wouldn't get people to
 
00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
come in to testify
 
00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
you have the public hearing because you
 
00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:56.790 --> 00:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
all right any other questions
 
00:45:59.510 --> 00:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
you know what i would suggest is that
 
00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
next week
 
00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:04.400 align:start position:0%

00:46:08.069 --> 00:46:08.079 align:start position:0%
through their package and into this
 
00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:10.240 align:start position:0%

for about an hour the hour isn't just
 
00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
quickly for them to talk
 
00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:46.480 align:start position:0%

and then the department of revenue will
 
00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:55.430 align:start position:0%
and then the department of revenue will
be

00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:46:58.550 --> 00:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
coming in to talk about an hour on their
 
00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:00.880 align:start position:0%

00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
they collect
 
00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
is probably about 60
 
00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
around 65 percent of the total revenues
 
00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
majority of the revenue because it's the
 
00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
big ones
 
00:47:22.829 --> 00:47:22.839 align:start position:0%

now
 
00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
the first one was jenny camarlo and i
 
00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
don't know the order of the others
 
00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
oh okay mike i just have a request
 
00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
um the literature that the uh
 
00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
presenters at the economic update um
 
00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
give us can we have that in color copy
 
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
because those charts are generally
 
00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:07.990 align:start position:0%
because those charts are generally
color-coded

00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
color-coded
 
00:48:10.549 --> 00:48:10.559 align:start position:0%
and i remember two years ago it was hard
 
00:48:10.559 --> 00:48:11.910 align:start position:0%
and i remember two years ago it was hard
to

00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
read them afterwards without the color
 
00:48:16.069 --> 00:48:16.079 align:start position:0%
that's a good point
 
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
again could you make sure
 
00:48:24.309 --> 00:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
yeah we'll see about it
 
00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
thank you well they don't all have to be
 
00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:28.530 align:start position:0%
but maybe just the chart pages
 
00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:30.230 align:start position:0%
but maybe just the chart pages

to recognize some of the words you're
 
00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:42.640 align:start position:0%
using i'm
 
00:48:45.829 --> 00:48:45.839 align:start position:0%
i wonder if you can arrange your screen
 
00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
so that you're looking more directly at
 
00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
the camera
 
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
in my computer there's a little light
 
00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
that shows where the camera
 
00:48:57.190 --> 00:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
is and you so i adjust it so that i'm
 
00:48:59.670 --> 00:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
looking straight into the camera
 
00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
and most of the people participating in
 
00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
this meeting
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
are looking straight forward and since
 
00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
we're all going to be spending a lot of
 
00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
time remotely
 
00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
if you could uh think about making your
 
00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
face directly looking at us is that
 
00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:17.589 align:start position:0%
face directly looking at us is that
better

00:49:17.589 --> 00:49:17.599 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
that's much better and it's just a minor
 
00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:21.109 align:start position:0%
that's much better and it's just a minor
detail

00:49:21.109 --> 00:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
detail
 
00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh at first i thought i was getting a
 
00:49:24.309 --> 00:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
little deaf but it
 
00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
i can turn up my sound on the computer
 
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
so apparently i've gotten used to
 
00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
looking at people's mouths that
 
00:49:35.349 --> 00:49:35.359 align:start position:0%
helps me understand what they're saying
 
00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:46.309 --> 00:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you norm i i just wanted for
 
00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:49.670 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you norm i i just wanted for
the

00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
freshman to remember that there's two
 
00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
different sets of rules that the
 
00:49:56.309 --> 00:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
we operate under the house normally
 
00:49:57.670 --> 00:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
operates under
 
00:50:00.309 --> 00:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
robert's rules for the committees but
 
00:50:02.309 --> 00:50:02.319 align:start position:0%
the house itself
 
00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
will operate some of the rules we passed
 
00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
last week out in the parking lot
 
00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
so i just it's just a subtle difference
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
as to
 
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
how the committee operates and how we
 
00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
have a little more freedom to do some
 
00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:15.589 align:start position:0%
have a little more freedom to do some
things

00:50:15.589 --> 00:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:50:18.549 --> 00:50:18.559 align:start position:0%
that we can't do when we're sitting as a
 
00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
body and
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
as representatives in reps hall just
 
00:50:29.349 --> 00:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
yeah one one other thing uh regarding
 
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
the the color
 
00:50:36.309 --> 00:50:36.319 align:start position:0%
of photos um you're absolutely correct
 
00:50:37.829 --> 00:50:37.839 align:start position:0%
getting them but if
 
00:50:40.230 --> 00:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
we get them sent to us you happen to
 
00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
have a color printer
 
00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
you can make your own it makes it easy
 
00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
that way
 
00:50:48.069 --> 00:50:48.079 align:start position:0%
saves the state money now if they would
 
00:50:50.069 --> 00:50:50.079 align:start position:0%
only pay us a per diem for sitting on
 
00:50:50.079 --> 00:50:50.470 align:start position:0%
only pay us a per diem for sitting on
our

00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
butts in our houses that would be or
 
00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:56.470 align:start position:0%
butts in our houses that would be or
better

00:50:56.470 --> 00:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:59.510 --> 00:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
okay uh patrick
 
00:51:04.549 --> 00:51:04.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
here i am um jordan i hate to i hate to
 
00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
break the news to you
 
00:51:11.109 --> 00:51:11.119 align:start position:0%
uh this is not why i had my hand raised
 
00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
but uh we went to a chairs meeting on
 
00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:14.710 align:start position:0%
but uh we went to a chairs meeting on
friday

00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
friday
 
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
and the clerk clarified the issue of
 
00:51:18.549 --> 00:51:18.559 align:start position:0%
robert's rules versus
 
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
mason and committees here's what he had
 
00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
written down we do not follow robert's
 
00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
rules anywhere in the new hampshire
 
00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:24.710 align:start position:0%
rules anywhere in the new hampshire
house

00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
house rules govern committee procedures
 
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
uh 100 to 111
 
00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
we're silent masons to be consulted
 
00:51:37.589 --> 00:51:37.599 align:start position:0%
so we have that that's uh um
 
00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
a change when did he decide to do that
 
00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:40.640 align:start position:0%
because we've been
 
00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
doing that in our uh in the committee
 
00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
for the last uh 20 years
 
00:51:47.589 --> 00:51:47.599 align:start position:0%
i'm just i'm just a messenger on this
 
00:51:47.599 --> 00:51:48.870 align:start position:0%
i'm just i'm just a messenger on this
one

00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh but but we're supposed to follow
 
00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
masons all the way through
 
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
we do majors rules
 
00:52:02.829 --> 00:52:02.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:02.839 --> 00:52:12.790 align:start position:0%
 
alan

00:52:12.790 --> 00:52:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:14.800 align:start position:0%
i have a few other things to mention
 
00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:16.309 align:start position:0%
i have a few other things to mention
okay

00:52:16.309 --> 00:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:52:18.549 --> 00:52:18.559 align:start position:0%
especially for the freshmen uh you're
 
00:52:19.829 --> 00:52:19.839 align:start position:0%
going to realize that we work very
 
00:52:21.109 --> 00:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
closely with the department of revenue
 
00:52:21.119 --> 00:52:22.549 align:start position:0%
closely with the department of revenue
administration

00:52:22.549 --> 00:52:22.559 align:start position:0%
administration
 
00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
and the legislative budget assistance
 
00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
that's dra and
 
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
lba those are the initials um
 
00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
you're also going to find that we work
 
00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
closely with the liquor commission and
 
00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
the lottery commission
 
00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
since we are the ones who deal with
 
00:52:38.549 --> 00:52:38.559 align:start position:0%
tobacco gambling and liquor
 
00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
issues so you're going to get to see a
 
00:52:43.109 --> 00:52:43.119 align:start position:0%
lot of those folks as well
 
00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh the pink card
 
00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
i was mentioned they're still for the
 
00:52:52.390 --> 00:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
former members and new members but
 
00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
former members
 
00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
they're still working on the process of
 
00:52:56.549 --> 00:52:56.559 align:start position:0%
how a pink card if it's going to be
 
00:52:56.559 --> 00:52:57.349 align:start position:0%
how a pink card if it's going to be
virtual

00:52:57.349 --> 00:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
virtual
 
00:52:59.430 --> 00:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
for the people testifying how do they
 
00:53:01.270 --> 00:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
get their pink card in
 
00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
and basically they are still in the
 
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
process of defining how that's going to
 
00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:05.910 align:start position:0%
process of defining how that's going to
work

00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
but basically when the calendar comes
 
00:53:10.309 --> 00:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
out i think it's going to be that they
 
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
have to
 
00:53:14.790 --> 00:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
email a certain person who will
 
00:53:18.069 --> 00:53:18.079 align:start position:0%
put them on um there won't be a
 
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
physical pink card but it'll be a list
 
00:53:22.549 --> 00:53:22.559 align:start position:0%
of people that want to testify from the
 
00:53:22.559 --> 00:53:23.349 align:start position:0%
of people that want to testify from the
public

00:53:23.349 --> 00:53:23.359 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:53:25.829 --> 00:53:25.839 align:start position:0%
okay so that's that's still being worked
 
00:53:25.839 --> 00:53:26.710 align:start position:0%
okay so that's that's still being worked
out

00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:26.720 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
and same thing with the blue sheet for
 
00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
people who want to sign in
 
00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
for new members there's a sheet which
 
00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:33.750 align:start position:0%
for new members there's a sheet which
which

00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
people who don't want to testify but
 
00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
want to support the bill they to sign in
 
00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
before a committee hearing
 
00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:40.640 align:start position:0%
uh there'll be an electronic version of
 
00:53:43.510 --> 00:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
the blue sheet as well
 
00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
i just want to jump in norm just to make
 
00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
sure everybody understands what an early
 
00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
bill is
 
00:53:51.349 --> 00:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
um because it's important to a couple of
 
00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
committees like
 
00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
like ways of means and finance we get a
 
00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
lot of what they're called second
 
00:53:56.470 --> 00:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
committee bills
 
00:54:00.069 --> 00:54:00.079 align:start position:0%
so early bills or bills that go to a
 
00:54:03.190 --> 00:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
a policy committee first like
 
00:54:07.109 --> 00:54:07.119 align:start position:0%
commerce or or a municipal
 
00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
and then they'll come to if it's a if it
 
00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
has any
 
00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh fee in there or any revenue that
 
00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
needs to be generated
 
00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
it will come to us as a second committee
 
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
and that happens like
 
00:54:21.589 --> 00:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
in norm said after mid february we start
 
00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
so when if we get 30 or 40 bills
 
00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
uh this year as primary bills
 
00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
remember we're also after after february
 
00:54:32.549 --> 00:54:32.559 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have we're probably
 
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
in possession of another five to ten
 
00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
bills in which we have to
 
00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
uh act on as and just on the piece that
 
00:54:41.589 --> 00:54:41.599 align:start position:0%
relates to fees and
 
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
and taxes uh that's that's our job
 
00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
um the one thing about ways and means
 
00:54:53.349 --> 00:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
not it's not true for every committee
 
00:54:56.230 --> 00:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
uh but we try to actually fix bills and
 
00:54:58.470 --> 00:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
that's where the subcommittee's come in
 
00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
if we and and believe me we do a lot of
 
00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
fixing of senate bills too
 
00:55:05.829 --> 00:55:05.839 align:start position:0%
that come to us and they actually look
 
00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
towards us to help fix them because we
 
00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:08.230 align:start position:0%
towards us to help fix them because we
actually

00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
really spend time with these bills but
 
00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
we do fix bills but the committee
 
00:55:14.789 --> 00:55:14.799 align:start position:0%
generally we take the
 
00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
temperature of the committee as to is
 
00:55:18.069 --> 00:55:18.079 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
even if we fix it is this something we
 
00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
think that the committee thinks is
 
00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:22.309 align:start position:0%
think that the committee thinks is
worthy

00:55:22.309 --> 00:55:22.319 align:start position:0%
worthy
 
00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
of being fixed if yes then normal
 
00:55:27.430 --> 00:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
call for a subcommittee to be formed to
 
00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
work work work fix the bill
 
00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
and uh and that usually requires
 
00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
amendments etcetera etcetera
 
00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
um the one
 
00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
little thing that i i again flip through
 
00:55:41.109 --> 00:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:55:45.349 --> 00:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
um the chairs meeting
 
00:55:46.870 --> 00:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
i'll make sure everybody understands
 
00:55:48.549 --> 00:55:48.559 align:start position:0%
this now this is really
 
00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
important when we're physically in the
 
00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:52.240 align:start position:0%
in the committee
 
00:55:55.109 --> 00:55:55.119 align:start position:0%
is yes a prime sponsor after if you're a
 
00:55:56.710 --> 00:55:56.720 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor in ways of means
 
00:55:58.950 --> 00:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
you present your bill you can't come
 
00:56:00.309 --> 00:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
back and sit down
 
00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
and you cannot ask questions if if
 
00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
you're a co-sponsor of a ways and means
 
00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:06.150 align:start position:0%
you're a co-sponsor of a ways and means
bill

00:56:06.150 --> 00:56:06.160 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:56:08.950 --> 00:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
you're allowed to come and sit down back
 
00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
in your seat
 
00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
but you cannot ask questions so that's
 
00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
that's the way that works and one end of
 
00:56:17.829 --> 00:56:17.839 align:start position:0%
the thought i just wrote some notes down
 
00:56:19.109 --> 00:56:19.119 align:start position:0%
is norm was talking
 
00:56:22.710 --> 00:56:22.720 align:start position:0%
the lob when we get back to lob
 
00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
currently the main entrance of the
 
00:56:26.549 --> 00:56:26.559 align:start position:0%
legislative office building
 
00:56:28.549 --> 00:56:28.559 align:start position:0%
is being repaired i just drove by there
 
00:56:30.069 --> 00:56:30.079 align:start position:0%
over the weekend i went to the
 
00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:32.720 align:start position:0%
audubon a little little all about hike
 
00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
and concord and
 
00:56:35.430 --> 00:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
this let me see how they're doing it
 
00:56:36.549 --> 00:56:36.559 align:start position:0%
seems like there's still a lot of work
 
00:56:38.069 --> 00:56:38.079 align:start position:0%
in that main entrance to be done so
 
00:56:40.470 --> 00:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
that main entrance so if you ever try to
 
00:56:42.069 --> 00:56:42.079 align:start position:0%
enter the lob you have to go around the
 
00:56:42.079 --> 00:56:42.630 align:start position:0%
enter the lob you have to go around the
back

00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:42.640 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:56:46.549 --> 00:56:46.559 align:start position:0%
up the parking garage and there's a uh
 
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
there's a security guard there that will
 
00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
will let you in
 
00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh and because they're gonna have two
 
00:56:53.829 --> 00:56:53.839 align:start position:0%
points of entry one in the llb as norm
 
00:56:53.839 --> 00:56:54.789 align:start position:0%
points of entry one in the llb as norm
said

00:56:54.789 --> 00:56:54.799 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:56:56.710 --> 00:56:56.720 align:start position:0%
because the security is gonna do a test
 
00:56:58.549 --> 00:56:58.559 align:start position:0%
temperature test
 
00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
on you uh and then let you in or you can
 
00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
go through that side entrance which most
 
00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
people some people especially freshmen
 
00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
don't know where the store is
 
00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:08.720 align:start position:0%
if you face the if you face the state
 
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
house if you look
 
00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
go to your uh right from the main
 
00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:13.510 align:start position:0%

entrance

00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:13.520 align:start position:0%

and it's a basement entrance on the side
 
00:57:16.549 --> 00:57:16.559 align:start position:0%

susan

00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:47.430 --> 00:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
you know you have done mute susan
 
00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:50.720 align:start position:0%
i do uh i've got two things here one of
 
00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:51.190 align:start position:0%
i do uh i've got two things here one of
them

00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:58:53.349 --> 00:58:53.359 align:start position:0%
is from something that representative
 
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
brownie said
 
00:58:58.230 --> 00:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
on i've been wondering are they going to
 
00:59:01.589 --> 00:59:01.599 align:start position:0%
give us parking assignments before
 
00:59:05.670 --> 00:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
next week or do we just
 
00:59:08.789 --> 00:59:08.799 align:start position:0%
all go down to the the garage
 
00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
on storm street
 
00:59:14.470 --> 00:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
i i would think that you'd have those
 
00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
parking assignments
 
00:59:19.349 --> 00:59:19.359 align:start position:0%
coming out
 
00:59:22.630 --> 00:59:22.640 align:start position:0%
the other thing though was on when we're
 
00:59:24.309 --> 00:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
doing a hearing
 
00:59:27.349 --> 00:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
quite very frequently somebody comes to
 
00:59:28.870 --> 00:59:28.880 align:start position:0%
the hearing with the intention of
 
00:59:31.589 --> 00:59:31.599 align:start position:0%
listening and speaking if necessary
 
00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
and if they have to sign up ahead of
 
00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:34.789 align:start position:0%
and if they have to sign up ahead of
time

00:59:34.789 --> 00:59:34.799 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:59:36.309 --> 00:59:36.319 align:start position:0%
i guess a whole lot of people are going
 
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
to have to sign up that might then want
 
00:59:41.589 --> 00:59:41.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:45.030 --> 00:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
that could very well be the um
 
00:59:48.549 --> 00:59:48.559 align:start position:0%
as pat said the process
 
00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
for the pink cards and the blue sheets
 
00:59:52.630 --> 00:59:52.640 align:start position:0%
have not been
 
00:59:56.069 --> 00:59:56.079 align:start position:0%
uh generated yet because how do you do
 
00:59:56.079 --> 00:59:56.630 align:start position:0%
uh generated yet because how do you do
it

00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:59:59.190 --> 00:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
they haven't come up with a solution yet
 
01:00:02.549 --> 01:00:02.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
and they won't let us know norm can i
 
01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
jump in
 
01:00:09.430 --> 01:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
yeah you're right norma i the we at the
 
01:00:10.710 --> 01:00:10.720 align:start position:0%
chairs meeting we asked a lot of
 
01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
questions uh there were a lot of
 
01:00:14.309 --> 01:00:14.319 align:start position:0%
unanswered questions
 
01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
uh these are some of them how's that all
 
01:00:17.829 --> 01:00:17.839 align:start position:0%
going to work
 
01:00:19.109 --> 01:00:19.119 align:start position:0%
and the more you ask the questions the
 
01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
more you know so they're working on it
 
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
the final rule isn't out yet as to how
 
01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to do this
 
01:00:27.030 --> 01:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
but i would imagine that uh that's why
 
01:00:28.309 --> 01:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
we that's why we're going to have
 
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
the other thing is that normally you may
 
01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
want to spend one minute one more minute
 
01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:32.069 align:start position:0%
want to spend one minute one more minute
again

01:00:32.069 --> 01:00:32.079 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:00:34.710 --> 01:00:34.720 align:start position:0%
on requesting the uh technical people
 
01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
for the committee
 
01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
that we're looking for too you may want
 
01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
to explain that a little bit more
 
01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
why we need that uh well
 
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
the problem is right now you have we
 
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
have jennifer for
 
01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:53.910 --> 01:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
monitoring the meeting when we get to
 
01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:55.190 align:start position:0%
monitoring the meeting when we get to
committees

01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
committees
 
01:00:57.910 --> 01:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind them if if we get to
 
01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
committees it's very hard for the chair
 
01:01:04.150 --> 01:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
to monitor what's going on
 
01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
with people from the outside et cetera
 
01:01:07.349 --> 01:01:07.359 align:start position:0%
et cetera
 
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
it's hard for the clerk to do that as
 
01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
well so the solution is only there's
 
01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
only four researchers
 
01:01:15.670 --> 01:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
it's it's impossible to spread them
 
01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
across all these meetings so
 
01:01:20.789 --> 01:01:20.799 align:start position:0%
the solution is to have a couple of
 
01:01:20.799 --> 01:01:21.270 align:start position:0%
the solution is to have a couple of
people

01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
on our committee each of the committees
 
01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:24.549 align:start position:0%
on our committee each of the committees
be

01:01:24.549 --> 01:01:24.559 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
volunteers to monitor
 
01:01:30.309 --> 01:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
when we're back to hybrid when we're
 
01:01:31.829 --> 01:01:31.839 align:start position:0%
back to actually being
 
01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
in the double rooms but the public is
 
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
that uh that we have a couple of our
 
01:01:43.990 --> 01:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
members who are one at a time though
 
01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
willing to
 
01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
for that that day to monitor uh
 
01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
what's going on the what's online so
 
01:01:54.630 --> 01:01:54.640 align:start position:0%
norm you want to take it from there but
 
01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
that that's
 
01:01:57.670 --> 01:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
that's the reason for that that that was
 
01:01:59.270 --> 01:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
the solution to
 
01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
not enough staff to cover potentially
 
01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:03.430 align:start position:0%
not enough staff to cover potentially
eight

01:02:03.430 --> 01:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
eight
 
01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
potentially eight hearings going on at
 
01:02:07.270 --> 01:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
the same time
 
01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
we just don't have enough researchers to
 
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:16.549 --> 01:02:16.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:27.349 --> 01:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm sorry i was slow with that um
 
01:02:27.990 --> 01:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
yeah just
 
01:02:31.029 --> 01:02:31.039 align:start position:0%
a question that uh it goes back to
 
01:02:34.309 --> 01:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
deadlines and uh you mentioned
 
01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
norm that uh you know the first deadline
 
01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
we'll be bumping into is february 18th
 
01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
and that's not far away
 
01:02:44.069 --> 01:02:44.079 align:start position:0%
um plus the budget uh message from the
 
01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
governor will be coming over on the
 
01:02:48.130 --> 01:02:48.140 align:start position:0%
16th i think
 
01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:49.270 align:start position:0%
16th i think
[Music]

01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:49.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
and so that brought to mind the fact
 
01:02:53.430 --> 01:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
that we now
 
01:02:56.789 --> 01:02:56.799 align:start position:0%
have in rule as a result of the
 
01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
recent meeting in session of the house a
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
allowance a provision that allows the
 
01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh uh extension change of those
 
01:03:09.029 --> 01:03:09.039 align:start position:0%
of those time deadlines that are in the
 
01:03:11.589 --> 01:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
rules uh by the speaker after
 
01:03:11.599 --> 01:03:12.630 align:start position:0%
rules uh by the speaker after
consultation

01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
consultation
 
01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
and i wondered if there's been any
 
01:03:16.069 --> 01:03:16.079 align:start position:0%
discussion of that
 
01:03:19.270 --> 01:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
we obviously are this whole system that
 
01:03:21.190 --> 01:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
we're working with is not only new but
 
01:03:23.029 --> 01:03:23.039 align:start position:0%
it's awkward and
 
01:03:26.549 --> 01:03:26.559 align:start position:0%
difficult and and while
 
01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
some things probably just can't change
 
01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:29.990 align:start position:0%
some things probably just can't change
because

01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
of the budget and it's sort of absolute
 
01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:34.549 align:start position:0%
of the budget and it's sort of absolute
deadline

01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:34.559 align:start position:0%
deadline
 
01:03:38.789 --> 01:03:38.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
i wondered whether there's been any
 
01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:42.640 align:start position:0%
discussion of what can be done
 
01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
to make this all manageable
 
01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
there has been some discussion and it's
 
01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:49.829 align:start position:0%
there has been some discussion and it's
a

01:03:49.829 --> 01:03:49.839 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:03:53.109 --> 01:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
discussion in part and progress because
 
01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
we don't know what the
 
01:03:56.549 --> 01:03:56.559 align:start position:0%
answers are and we're not sure what the
 
01:03:56.559 --> 01:04:05.910 align:start position:0%
answers are and we're not sure what the
questions

01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:08.309 --> 01:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget on the 15th
 
01:04:08.319 --> 01:04:09.589 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget on the 15th
normally

01:04:09.589 --> 01:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
normally
 
01:04:12.789 --> 01:04:12.799 align:start position:0%
looks like it may be this the 16th
 
01:04:16.069 --> 01:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
the 16th we want to have our run is
 
01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
and the 18th is the second committed
 
01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:19.829 align:start position:0%
and the 18th is the second committed
bills

01:04:19.829 --> 01:04:19.839 align:start position:0%
bills
 
01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
that have to be out of the committee at
 
01:04:26.710 --> 01:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
that point in time
 
01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
depends on how many second committee
 
01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
bills we have now whether or not
 
01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:33.839 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a real issue for us
 
01:04:33.839 --> 01:04:34.950 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a real issue for us
and

01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:38.309 --> 01:04:38.319 align:start position:0%
i hope that very soon i'll know
 
01:04:40.549 --> 01:04:40.559 align:start position:0%
all the bills that we have and having a
 
01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
second committee
 
01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
if it's just one or two second committee
 
01:04:45.270 --> 01:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
deals we should be able to
 
01:04:48.549 --> 01:04:48.559 align:start position:0%
hold it because the 18th
 
01:04:52.630 --> 01:04:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:54.630 --> 01:04:54.640 align:start position:0%
the next week you know what we're going
 
01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
to be going next week
 
01:04:57.190 --> 01:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
you know we're going to be doing the
 
01:04:59.510 --> 01:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
week after this and that takes care of
 
01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
two weeks
 
01:05:05.589 --> 01:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:10.309 --> 01:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
we still need to have a work session
 
01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
on revenues that's the most important
 
01:05:14.549 --> 01:05:14.559 align:start position:0%
thing we have right now that's number
 
01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:16.799 align:start position:0%
one priority
 
01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
now if i find that
 
01:05:24.069 --> 01:05:24.079 align:start position:0%
we have too many second committee bills
 
01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
that we're gonna have to come to some
 
01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
agreement with the speaker
 
01:05:31.349 --> 01:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
and say hey you can't do this you may
 
01:05:31.359 --> 01:05:32.390 align:start position:0%
and say hey you can't do this you may
say

01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
well okay what we'll do is just
 
01:05:38.309 --> 01:05:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:41.589 --> 01:05:41.599 align:start position:0%
and that could be one solution but then
 
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
if there's something that they're
 
01:05:45.490 --> 01:05:45.500 align:start position:0%
experiencing important goals
 
01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:48.150 align:start position:0%
experiencing important goals
[Music]

01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
we need to know what we have to deal
 
01:05:54.069 --> 01:05:54.079 align:start position:0%
with we don't know that yet
 
01:05:57.270 --> 01:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
but you're right it's a good work in
 
01:05:59.190 --> 01:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
progress it's going to be challenges
 
01:06:03.029 --> 01:06:03.039 align:start position:0%
all the way up all the way along
 
01:06:06.789 --> 01:06:06.799 align:start position:0%
because we can't if we could
 
01:06:10.069 --> 01:06:10.079 align:start position:0%
we have problems and we can meet
 
01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
as a committee as a whole meeting the
 
01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
schedules that we have
 
01:06:18.390 --> 01:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
now multiplying what the problems are
 
01:06:19.109 --> 01:06:19.119 align:start position:0%
and you can't
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
meet as a whole to discuss these things
 
01:06:24.549 --> 01:06:24.559 align:start position:0%
and to interrogate
 
01:06:27.990 --> 01:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
witnesses and all that in person
 
01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
it's a whole different world we have to
 
01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:37.589 align:start position:0%
it's a whole different world we have to
work

01:06:37.589 --> 01:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you and if anybody has any
 
01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:42.870 align:start position:0%
thank you and if anybody has any
suggestions

01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
suggestions
 
01:06:46.549 --> 01:06:46.559 align:start position:0%
please step right up to the plate
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
and as far as uh this new world of
 
01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
being able to operate under the zoom and
 
01:06:55.829 --> 01:06:55.839 align:start position:0%
and i did
 
01:06:58.230 --> 01:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
if you have experience that you think
 
01:06:59.670 --> 01:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
you can help
 
01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
let me know because we're gonna need you
 
01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
to make the committee successful
 
01:07:12.069 --> 01:07:12.079 align:start position:0%
there's 24 of us and
 
01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
whoever's running a meeting
 
01:07:18.309 --> 01:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
can't handle everything all at once it
 
01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:27.750 --> 01:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
okay uh susan your hand is still up
 
01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
um yeah well i've been putting it up and
 
01:07:36.150 --> 01:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
taking it down as you did things
 
01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
but uh i just wanted to volunteer
 
01:07:42.069 --> 01:07:42.079 align:start position:0%
on some of us that have been through
 
01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
this quite a lot
 
01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
and so we don't have to listen quite as
 
01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
attentively to the testimony as others
 
01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
maybe could help by just watching the
 
01:07:56.470 --> 01:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
the uh hand raising
 
01:08:00.069 --> 01:08:00.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:03.270 --> 01:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
yes especially when we're talking as a
 
01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:04.710 align:start position:0%
yes especially when we're talking as a
committee

01:08:04.710 --> 01:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
right and and not only the hand raising
 
01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:08.230 align:start position:0%
right and and not only the hand raising
from

01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:08:11.349 --> 01:08:11.359 align:start position:0%
the participants but we need to
 
01:08:16.229 --> 01:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:20.149 --> 01:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
and that may take two two people one for
 
01:08:22.309 --> 01:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
monitoring the participants and one for
 
01:08:24.070 --> 01:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
mourning the public
 
01:08:27.349 --> 01:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
we need to treat them as well as we
 
01:08:31.110 --> 01:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:34.950 --> 01:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure does the public have
 
01:08:38.070 --> 01:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
on a hand raising facility i don't
 
01:08:41.749 --> 01:08:41.759 align:start position:0%
see it i'm not sure i'm looking at the
 
01:08:43.349 --> 01:08:43.359 align:start position:0%
attendees list
 
01:08:45.669 --> 01:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
they do have it's just that no one in
 
01:08:46.390 --> 01:08:46.400 align:start position:0%
the attendees
 
01:08:48.709 --> 01:08:48.719 align:start position:0%
should be raising their hand right now
 
01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
ah right
 
01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
they okay again
 
01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
how do they get questions to us
 
01:09:01.189 --> 01:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
or comments um
 
01:09:04.149 --> 01:09:04.159 align:start position:0%
if you were soliciting comments during a
 
01:09:06.390 --> 01:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
work session um
 
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
you could ask anyone who
 
01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:11.199 align:start position:0%
you could you could call on someone
 
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
specifically that you could see in the
 
01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
attendee list
 
01:09:15.990 --> 01:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
or you could ask an attendee to raise
 
01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
their hand yeah
 
01:09:21.669 --> 01:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
and and i think it all boils down to
 
01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
how do we replicate
 
01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
the blue sheet i think those
 
01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:29.030 align:start position:0%
the blue sheet i think those
instructions

01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
instructions
 
01:09:31.829 --> 01:09:31.839 align:start position:0%
are becoming representative major from
 
01:09:31.839 --> 01:09:32.390 align:start position:0%
are becoming representative major from
um

01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
from leadership right and that that has
 
01:09:39.349 --> 01:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
come yet yes the same way is how do we
 
01:09:41.030 --> 01:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
replicate the
 
01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:48.319 align:start position:0%
pink parts that hasn't been solved yet
 
01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
i've said major if i could i can't
 
01:09:51.749 --> 01:09:51.759 align:start position:0%
remember if you
 
01:09:56.790 --> 01:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
in explained who gen 4 is
 
01:10:01.590 --> 01:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
yes she did okay our researcher not just
 
01:10:04.950 --> 01:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
a staffer who's very good at tech jen
 
01:10:07.350 --> 01:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
is a committed researcher and she's one
 
01:10:08.950 --> 01:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
of the best there is
 
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
at the lld and then our committee
 
01:10:13.189 --> 01:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
assistant is karen
 
01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
thank you she's
 
01:10:25.590 --> 01:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
she's good um
 
01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
but both the committee researcher and
 
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:10:32.950 --> 01:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
assistance not only serve
 
01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
our committees our committee but a
 
01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
number of other committees
 
01:10:39.990 --> 01:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
i think again how many committees do you
 
01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.310 align:start position:0%
i think again how many committees do you
serve

01:10:42.310 --> 01:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
serve
 
01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
um i have three permanent committees
 
01:10:46.070 --> 01:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
weights and means
 
01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
education and judiciary um
 
01:10:53.110 --> 01:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
our beloved joel anderson retired at the
 
01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
end of the year
 
01:10:58.470 --> 01:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
after i believe 33 years of service um
 
01:11:01.750 --> 01:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
and so i'm i'm currently also filling in
 
01:11:05.910 --> 01:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:09.350 --> 01:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
wow and and karen is
 
01:11:12.950 --> 01:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
just almost the same
 
01:11:17.830 --> 01:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
yes yes joel anderson
 
01:11:24.229 --> 01:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:28.709 --> 01:11:28.719 align:start position:0%
science and technology back in 1997.
 
01:11:35.110 --> 01:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
now representative all
 
01:11:43.350 --> 01:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
yes um first i'd like to offer my
 
01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:44.390 align:start position:0%
yes um first i'd like to offer my
services

01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:11:48.310 --> 01:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
to help in any way i'm relatively tech
 
01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:49.590 align:start position:0%
to help in any way i'm relatively tech
savvy

01:11:49.590 --> 01:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
savvy
 
01:11:53.110 --> 01:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
great and second i
 
01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
wondered if the freshmen know how to
 
01:11:57.430 --> 01:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
access the bills
 
01:11:59.590 --> 01:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
um through the general court website so
 
01:12:04.149 --> 01:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
and if not maybe
 
01:12:10.229 --> 01:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
we could tell them now or jen could send
 
01:12:12.229 --> 01:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
them a little
 
01:12:15.510 --> 01:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
outline of how to get there
 
01:12:18.870 --> 01:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
all right i
 
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
maybe i'm wrong but i assume that they
 
01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
have been attending the freshman
 
01:12:29.430 --> 01:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
workshops is there any freshman here
 
01:12:34.390 --> 01:12:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:42.310 --> 01:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
i was just going to say you go to the
 
01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
committees and
 
01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
the ways and means and then it says
 
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:48.830 align:start position:0%
the ways and means and then it says
bills

01:12:48.830 --> 01:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
bills
 
01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:52.070 align:start position:0%
bills
uh

01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:55.110 --> 01:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
it's just there sorry
 
01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
listen committee yeah so if you go
 
01:12:58.470 --> 01:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
through the
 
01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
committee our ways and means committee
 
01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:01.830 align:start position:0%
committee our ways and means committee
you'll

01:13:01.830 --> 01:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
you'll
 
01:13:03.430 --> 01:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
you'll find a way to see all the bills
 
01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
and then you just click on the number
 
01:13:05.910 --> 01:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
and it will pop up
 
01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
and you can open it or read it
 
01:13:12.070 --> 01:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
representative would you mind
 
01:13:17.270 --> 01:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
if any of the freshmen
 
01:13:20.149 --> 01:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
how many members have a problem with
 
01:13:20.790 --> 01:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
01:13:23.350 --> 01:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
if they contact you and you walk them
 
01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
through this
 
01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
that'd be fine yeah sure i don't mind
 
01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
that would be simpler because if you get
 
01:13:32.310 --> 01:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
a head start on them
 
01:13:34.950 --> 01:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
when we finally get rolling you'll it's
 
01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:35.350 align:start position:0%
when we finally get rolling you'll it's
a

01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:13:38.470 --> 01:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
it's helpful right because that
 
01:13:42.070 --> 01:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
and that's from experience you you want
 
01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
to go through
 
01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
and read every bill as soon as you
 
01:13:49.110 --> 01:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
can and start making notes on it
 
01:13:50.950 --> 01:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
so that you're not reading the bill when
 
01:13:52.709 --> 01:13:52.719 align:start position:0%
the public hearing comes up you want to
 
01:13:54.310 --> 01:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
read the bill ahead of time make
 
01:13:56.709 --> 01:13:56.719 align:start position:0%
notes so you know what your questions
 
01:13:58.950 --> 01:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
are going to be
 
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
and you may want to ask some questions
 
01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
before we even had the public hearing so
 
01:14:04.709 --> 01:14:04.719 align:start position:0%
you understand better
 
01:14:08.390 --> 01:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
what's going on and then
 
01:14:11.910 --> 01:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
as a result the committee is a better
 
01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:12.470 align:start position:0%
as a result the committee is a better
committee

01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:14:24.630 --> 01:14:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:27.910 --> 01:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
back to that question about uh who's
 
01:14:29.510 --> 01:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
going to enable the
 
01:14:32.070 --> 01:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
or uh people who want to testify to
 
01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:32.630 align:start position:0%
or uh people who want to testify to
speak

01:14:32.630 --> 01:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
speak
 
01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
on zoom uh my understanding is that once
 
01:14:37.830 --> 01:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
they sign up in the as a
 
01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
that they want to speak before the night
 
01:14:41.669 --> 01:14:41.679 align:start position:0%
before day before
 
01:14:44.070 --> 01:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
the hearing uh once it once it's
 
01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
published in the calendar
 
01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
the calendar they can start saying they
 
01:14:49.990 --> 01:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
want to speak to the bill
 
01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
that somehow magically i don't know if
 
01:14:53.189 --> 01:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
it's going to be centralized or
 
01:14:53.199 --> 01:14:54.630 align:start position:0%
it's going to be centralized or
decentralized

01:14:54.630 --> 01:14:54.640 align:start position:0%
decentralized
 
01:14:56.310 --> 01:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
but then they they'll be able they will
 
01:14:57.830 --> 01:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
be enabled
 
01:14:59.830 --> 01:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
to uh enter the meeting in a way that
 
01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
they can be recognized
 
01:15:04.070 --> 01:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
that's all we know so far yeah but we
 
01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
the detail of that
 
01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
thank you uh any more
 
01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:20.630 align:start position:0%
thank you uh any more
questions

01:15:20.630 --> 01:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:25.189 --> 01:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
not seeing any more questions and
 
01:15:31.270 --> 01:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:33.189 --> 01:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
whether it's going to be a completely
 
01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
zone meeting
 
01:15:36.070 --> 01:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
but it's going to you're going to be
 
01:15:37.669 --> 01:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
meeting in
 
01:15:41.990 --> 01:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
reps hall i'll also get the schedule out
 
01:15:44.229 --> 01:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
once i get the okay from the speaker's
 
01:15:46.229 --> 01:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
office what days we can have the
 
01:15:47.990 --> 01:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
following week
 
01:15:50.149 --> 01:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
to meet with all the agency heads
 
01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
associated with
 
01:15:55.270 --> 01:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
all the revenue streams so we can get
 
01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
that under our belt
 
01:15:59.030 --> 01:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
and then work towards the following and
 
01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
next week
 
01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
to start doing the work sessions on the
 
01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:05.430 align:start position:0%
to start doing the work sessions on the
revenues

01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
i just as soon as
 
01:16:10.950 --> 01:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
we have all the bills then i'll know
 
01:16:14.149 --> 01:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
what the early bills are
 
01:16:16.630 --> 01:16:16.640 align:start position:0%
and see whether or not we can handle
 
01:16:19.350 --> 01:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
those as well as the revenue estimates
 
01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
within the time frame that's been
 
01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
allotted to us
 
01:16:26.709 --> 01:16:26.719 align:start position:0%
and then see what what our next step
 
01:16:28.950 --> 01:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:58.870 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:16:58.870 --> 01:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
so basically i just had a question on
 
01:17:02.550 --> 01:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
scheduling i know that you said that
 
01:17:03.510 --> 01:17:03.520 align:start position:0%
because of
 
01:17:05.910 --> 01:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
the constraints with zoom and so forth
 
01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
in meeting rooms
 
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
um meetings could be scheduled anywhere
 
01:17:11.270 --> 01:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
from monday to friday
 
01:17:13.270 --> 01:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
um with the goal i mean and i know
 
01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
typically when i have other things to
 
01:17:15.990 --> 01:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
schedule i usually try to schedule
 
01:17:18.630 --> 01:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
them on mondays or friday to avoid
 
01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:19.510 align:start position:0%
them on mondays or friday to avoid
conflicts

01:17:19.510 --> 01:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
conflicts
 
01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
with the goal be to try to schedule
 
01:17:23.030 --> 01:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
things between tuesday and thursday and
 
01:17:24.550 --> 01:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
then monday and friday would be
 
01:17:31.030 --> 01:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
back up
 
01:17:33.430 --> 01:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
try to get all of our committee work
 
01:17:35.110 --> 01:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
tuesday wednesday and thursday
 
01:17:38.149 --> 01:17:38.159 align:start position:0%
so that we can do our other stuff
 
01:17:44.229 --> 01:17:44.239 align:start position:0%
on mondays and fridays such as
 
01:17:47.350 --> 01:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
and i'll i'll try to do that and just as
 
01:17:49.590 --> 01:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
soon as i find out
 
01:17:53.030 --> 01:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
what they're going to a lot to us i'll
 
01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:03.669 --> 01:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
all right okay there's one more
 
01:18:07.189 --> 01:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh walter spellsbury
 
01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i suppose this
 
01:18:11.910 --> 01:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
asks for a broad generalization but more
 
01:18:13.350 --> 01:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
or less
 
01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
what might we be expecting to receive in
 
01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
hard copy
 
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
as this process follows and what
 
01:18:22.630 --> 01:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
should we anticipate in terms of running
 
01:18:26.790 --> 01:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
the printing press at home good
 
01:18:32.310 --> 01:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:35.910 --> 01:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
um i i don't think we have an answer for
 
01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
this yet
 
01:18:39.750 --> 01:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
it's another one of those things that um
 
01:18:42.709 --> 01:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
that we're waiting for a final word but
 
01:18:44.229 --> 01:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
i'll certainly keep it in mind and if i
 
01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
learn something i can
 
01:18:48.149 --> 01:18:48.159 align:start position:0%
i can pass that along what we're trying
 
01:18:48.709 --> 01:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:18:52.229 --> 01:18:52.239 align:start position:0%
is get from the
 
01:18:55.990 --> 01:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
presenters early enough a
 
01:18:58.790 --> 01:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
copy so that we can copy it and send it
 
01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
out to you
 
01:19:03.350 --> 01:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
but obviously if they send it to us on
 
01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:04.550 align:start position:0%
but obviously if they send it to us on
friday

01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
friday
 
01:19:06.550 --> 01:19:06.560 align:start position:0%
that that won't that will not happen i
 
01:19:07.830 --> 01:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
can assure you that for the
 
01:19:09.830 --> 01:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
presentations next week that's not going
 
01:19:11.350 --> 01:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
to be an option
 
01:19:13.350 --> 01:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
to to to send it through the mail
 
01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
because they um
 
01:19:19.430 --> 01:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
they most likely won't get their
 
01:19:22.470 --> 01:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
materials to me by
 
01:19:25.669 --> 01:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
until thursday and then monday is a
 
01:19:25.679 --> 01:19:27.030 align:start position:0%
until thursday and then monday is a
holiday

01:19:27.030 --> 01:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
holiday
 
01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
right all of the materials for next
 
01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:30.950 align:start position:0%
right all of the materials for next
week's

01:19:30.950 --> 01:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
week's
 
01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
program will be posted online
 
01:19:36.709 --> 01:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
and if there's any problem accessing
 
01:19:38.229 --> 01:19:38.239 align:start position:0%
them that way i can
 
01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
i can email them to you as well but i
 
01:19:43.590 --> 01:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
i can tell you for sure for next week's
 
01:19:45.270 --> 01:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
programs that's not going to be
 
01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
something that we'll be able to do to
 
01:19:48.630 --> 01:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
mail them
 
01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
we're still getting christmas cards
 
01:19:53.430 --> 01:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
mailed the 14th of december
 
01:19:58.390 --> 01:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:00.870 --> 01:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
well i'm sure the zoom environment is
 
01:20:02.229 --> 01:20:02.239 align:start position:0%
changing things
 
01:20:04.390 --> 01:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
and none of us knows exactly what to
 
01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
expect but
 
01:20:07.990 --> 01:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
um are bills generally printed and
 
01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
distributed or is that also something
 
01:20:11.350 --> 01:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
that we just read online and print off
 
01:20:13.110 --> 01:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
on our own
 
01:20:16.149 --> 01:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
um if you have access to net into the
 
01:20:17.189 --> 01:20:17.199 align:start position:0%
state house
 
01:20:21.830 --> 01:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
you can go up to the sagittarian alarms
 
01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
or the collects office and get copies of
 
01:20:26.070 --> 01:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
the bills
 
01:20:31.270 --> 01:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:33.910 --> 01:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
normally if when you do your business at
 
01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
the state house
 
01:20:38.790 --> 01:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
uh the your committee assistant
 
01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
will have all the bills for your
 
01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:42.149 align:start position:0%
will have all the bills for your
committee

01:20:42.149 --> 01:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:20:45.669 --> 01:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
in your slot so they're there
 
01:20:49.430 --> 01:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
now where we don't go to this llv or the
 
01:20:50.709 --> 01:20:50.719 align:start position:0%
state house
 
01:20:53.510 --> 01:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
then if we want to know about the bills
 
01:20:54.870 --> 01:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to print them
 
01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:56.310 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to print them
ourselves

01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
ourselves
 
01:20:59.990 --> 01:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
or take a trip up to the state house
 
01:21:02.870 --> 01:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
and get a coffee from the collector
 
01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:05.750 align:start position:0%
and get a coffee from the collector
office

01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:08.229 --> 01:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
so i've been doing a lot of printing
 
01:21:09.750 --> 01:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
matter of fact
 
01:21:13.030 --> 01:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
i'm wearing my printer out
 
01:21:16.470 --> 01:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
in on ways of means
 
01:21:21.830 --> 01:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:25.030 --> 01:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
you i go through
 
01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
almost a thousand pages a month
 
01:21:35.910 --> 01:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:37.669 --> 01:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
because this is the beginning of a
 
01:21:39.750 --> 01:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
session you've got to print
 
01:21:43.110 --> 01:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
all this stuff
 
01:21:45.750 --> 01:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
most of the presentations that are
 
01:21:48.709 --> 01:21:48.719 align:start position:0%
coming out for next week
 
01:21:52.229 --> 01:21:52.239 align:start position:0%
i'll probably end up printing most of it
 
01:21:55.189 --> 01:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
because jen says they're not going to
 
01:21:57.189 --> 01:21:57.199 align:start position:0%
send it to us so that we have it
 
01:21:59.270 --> 01:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
so she has it monday when you can send
 
01:22:01.430 --> 01:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
it out even if you do send it out we may
 
01:22:04.629 --> 01:22:04.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
so i would advise getting it pointed
 
01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:09.030 align:start position:0%
so i would advise getting it pointed
because

01:22:09.030 --> 01:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:22:12.070 --> 01:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
if you have a pretty copy you're a lot
 
01:22:13.510 --> 01:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
better off you can make notes on that
 
01:22:15.590 --> 01:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
print copy as your presenters
 
01:22:19.350 --> 01:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
talking about it so
 
01:22:21.669 --> 01:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
i'll always err on this either printing
 
01:22:21.679 --> 01:22:22.790 align:start position:0%
i'll always err on this either printing
there

01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:22:28.950 --> 01:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:32.390 --> 01:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
there's a better answer than that
 
01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:40.550 align:start position:0%
there's a better answer than that
susan

01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:45.189 --> 01:22:45.199 align:start position:0%
sorry uh first on we have one person on
 
01:22:45.990 --> 01:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
our committee
 
01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
who uh has no computer that's
 
01:22:52.149 --> 01:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
representative griffin and i hope that
 
01:22:54.070 --> 01:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
someone's going to get her
 
01:22:57.669 --> 01:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
the materials for next week somehow
 
01:23:00.790 --> 01:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
printed on and
 
01:23:04.550 --> 01:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
second on is it going to be at all
 
01:23:05.990 --> 01:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
possible maybe for
 
01:23:09.669 --> 01:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
the clerk's office to create bundles
 
01:23:13.669 --> 01:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
of bills by committee and
 
01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
enough for each committee and have those
 
01:23:18.070 --> 01:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
of us that can
 
01:23:21.990 --> 01:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
drive into concord to pick them up
 
01:23:23.830 --> 01:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
no way because they aren't going to want
 
01:23:25.830 --> 01:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
us in the building all the time
 
01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
going in to try to go to the clerk's
 
01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
office and they're
 
01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
not going to want that
 
01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
um let me talk to the clerk about
 
01:23:40.870 --> 01:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
about that and we'll send an email to it
 
01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
to all the committee members what that
 
01:23:57.669 --> 01:23:57.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:00.149 --> 01:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
yeah on the same topic i think it's only
 
01:24:01.430 --> 01:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
fair that
 
01:24:03.590 --> 01:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
we you and i should really uh talk to
 
01:24:05.430 --> 01:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
the speaker about this one
 
01:24:07.350 --> 01:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
you know that we're going to be saving a
 
01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
lot of mileage money
 
01:24:12.149 --> 01:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
so i i i don't think it should be a
 
01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
burden on the
 
01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
on our legislative budget to have
 
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
all of the bills mailed to us ahead of
 
01:24:21.750 --> 01:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
time i think that's only fair
 
01:24:24.790 --> 01:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
i mean um i've been
 
01:24:25.910 --> 01:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
the last year i've been spending a lot
 
01:24:27.830 --> 01:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
of money on my own paper on my own ink
 
01:24:30.950 --> 01:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
it's not cheap and i don't think it's
 
01:24:34.149 --> 01:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
i think it's unreasonable for them to
 
01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
ask our members to print all the stuff
 
01:24:37.830 --> 01:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
that comes to us
 
01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
the other concern i got as we've been
 
01:24:41.590 --> 01:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
talking here is
 
01:24:43.510 --> 01:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
those of us been around we know that
 
01:24:44.870 --> 01:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
everybody who testifies
 
01:24:46.629 --> 01:24:46.639 align:start position:0%
comes in with some handouts or multiple
 
01:24:46.639 --> 01:24:48.870 align:start position:0%
comes in with some handouts or multiple
handouts

01:24:48.870 --> 01:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
handouts
 
01:24:50.629 --> 01:24:50.639 align:start position:0%
and the question becomes how are we
 
01:24:53.030 --> 01:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
going to get all those handouts
 
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
and those handouts are very helpful they
 
01:24:56.709 --> 01:24:56.719 align:start position:0%
have charts and things that you can
 
01:24:58.070 --> 01:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
relate to that they
 
01:25:00.870 --> 01:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
point to as they're testifying and i
 
01:25:02.149 --> 01:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
think it's unreasonable
 
01:25:05.189 --> 01:25:05.199 align:start position:0%
to ask uh
 
01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
again for us to up to for all the
 
01:25:08.629 --> 01:25:08.639 align:start position:0%
committee members to
 
01:25:11.830 --> 01:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
to print these out at home uh we all
 
01:25:13.189 --> 01:25:13.199 align:start position:0%
have different quality printers and all
 
01:25:14.310 --> 01:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
of that
 
01:25:16.870 --> 01:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
so this is a big issue i think uh i
 
01:25:18.310 --> 01:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
don't i don't think it's a fiscal issue
 
01:25:19.430 --> 01:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
because we're saving all the money on
 
01:25:21.030 --> 01:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
mileage i think it's a matter of
 
01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
just it's a timing issue of how quickly
 
01:25:26.310 --> 01:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
things can get to us in the mail
 
01:25:27.910 --> 01:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
the bills certainly should begin we
 
01:25:30.070 --> 01:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
should get the bills in in the mail
 
01:25:32.390 --> 01:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh well ahead of time uh so we don't
 
01:25:33.590 --> 01:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
have to print those
 
01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh and you should have paper copies
 
01:25:37.430 --> 01:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
because we all re we all write on those
 
01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:37.910 align:start position:0%
because we all re we all write on those
things

01:25:37.910 --> 01:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:25:40.470 --> 01:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
uh everybody that i know we write our
 
01:25:42.149 --> 01:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
notes on the bills
 
01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh and keep track especially then when
 
01:25:46.790 --> 01:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
we go to executive session we remind
 
01:25:48.470 --> 01:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
ourselves of what was said and
 
01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
and what's there so but anyway i think
 
01:25:52.149 --> 01:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
that's something that's
 
01:25:53.590 --> 01:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
that's fair that we should try to work
 
01:25:56.950 --> 01:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
on um and uh
 
01:25:58.390 --> 01:25:58.400 align:start position:0%
you and i know i could talk offline on
 
01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:06.830 --> 01:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:10.550 align:start position:0%
 
tom

01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:13.110 --> 01:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
thank you um i was just going to say i
 
01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:13.590 align:start position:0%
thank you um i was just going to say i
know

01:26:13.590 --> 01:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:26:15.990 --> 01:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
already bills are moving forward all of
 
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
these comments
 
01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
make me think the more we could put off
 
01:26:21.270 --> 01:26:21.280 align:start position:0%
until next year the better when we get
 
01:26:22.870 --> 01:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
more back to a normal
 
01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh committee setup because uh
 
01:26:27.590 --> 01:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
it just seems like to prioritize the
 
01:26:29.030 --> 01:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
most important bills
 
01:26:30.870 --> 01:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
the most important handouts you know and
 
01:26:34.950 --> 01:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:37.990 --> 01:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
i'm with you tom
 
01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:45.430 --> 01:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
thank you on i just want to speak up
 
01:26:49.910 --> 01:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
for the people in the 037 zip code
 
01:26:51.990 --> 01:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
which i think is four of us including
 
01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
the gentleman from charleston i think
 
01:26:55.990 --> 01:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
it's 0.37
 
01:26:58.310 --> 01:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
anything that comes from concord in
 
01:26:59.350 --> 01:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
normal times
 
01:27:01.669 --> 01:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
takes three to four working days to
 
01:27:01.679 --> 01:27:02.950 align:start position:0%
takes three to four working days to
arrive

01:27:02.950 --> 01:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
arrive
 
01:27:06.390 --> 01:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
on so on i don't know if you could speak
 
01:27:08.310 --> 01:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
to the clerk or maybe i should speak to
 
01:27:10.550 --> 01:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
the clerk if this happens
 
01:27:14.310 --> 01:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
on that on somebody
 
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
from his uh from the staff
 
01:27:21.510 --> 01:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
who's driving up past new london
 
01:27:24.870 --> 01:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
can dump things in a post office
 
01:27:27.270 --> 01:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
in that direction so that we don't have
 
01:27:29.350 --> 01:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
to wait
 
01:27:31.270 --> 01:27:31.280 align:start position:0%
probably at this point two weeks for
 
01:27:32.709 --> 01:27:32.719 align:start position:0%
things to show up
 
01:27:36.790 --> 01:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:39.510 --> 01:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
or maybe we just end up spending a lot
 
01:27:42.149 --> 01:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
of money on print
 
01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
thanks well i think people are going to
 
01:27:47.110 --> 01:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
have to
 
01:27:50.229 --> 01:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
come up with some workarounds i know i
 
01:27:51.270 --> 01:27:51.280 align:start position:0%
have uh
 
01:27:55.510 --> 01:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
my hp instant ink with
 
01:27:59.110 --> 01:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
a helix package it started at 15
 
01:28:03.669 --> 01:28:03.679 align:start position:0%
a month then in 1999 a month
 
01:28:06.910 --> 01:28:06.920 align:start position:0%
now 25 40 20
 
01:28:10.790 --> 01:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
24.99 a month that gives me 700 pages
 
01:28:14.149 --> 01:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
and then every 150 more it's
 
01:28:17.110 --> 01:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
pages and so much it's costing me at
 
01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:26.790 align:start position:0%
pages and so much it's costing me at
bundles

01:28:26.790 --> 01:28:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:29.830 --> 01:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
i think we're uh have we finished our
 
01:28:32.229 --> 01:28:32.239 align:start position:0%
meeting really
 
01:28:36.310 --> 01:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
okay i i think you probably have
 
01:28:39.510 --> 01:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
everybody's satisfied then
 
01:28:42.870 --> 01:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
we will let you know about the status of
 
01:28:45.110 --> 01:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
next week's
 
01:28:48.390 --> 01:28:48.400 align:start position:0%
two days of economic updates and how
 
01:28:50.709 --> 01:28:50.719 align:start position:0%
we're going to handle those
 
01:28:54.629 --> 01:28:54.639 align:start position:0%
i'll find out how
 
01:28:58.149 --> 01:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
we can get these bills to you and
 
01:29:01.990 --> 01:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
anything else we'll communicate to you
 
01:29:04.709 --> 01:29:04.719 align:start position:0%
there's one one final thing we're
 
01:29:09.270 --> 01:29:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:13.110 --> 01:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
license right now and there's only so
 
01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:13.510 align:start position:0%
license right now and there's only so
many

01:29:13.510 --> 01:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
many
 
01:29:17.030 --> 01:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
legislative licenses that can
 
01:29:20.070 --> 01:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
be handled at once
 
01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
does anybody have a problem uh
 
01:29:27.669 --> 01:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
i have my own license for the zoom
 
01:29:32.070 --> 01:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
so if i can't have a legislative license
 
01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
time slot does anybody have a problem if
 
01:29:36.149 --> 01:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
we need to have a
 
01:29:39.350 --> 01:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
special meeting with them
 
01:29:41.669 --> 01:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i don't know what the
 
01:29:43.189 --> 01:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
current speaker
 
01:29:46.390 --> 01:29:46.400 align:start position:0%
uh wants to do about this but
 
01:29:49.990 --> 01:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
we were forbidden from meeting
 
01:29:53.510 --> 01:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
on private zooms for a public meeting
 
01:29:55.990 --> 01:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
last term
 
01:29:58.229 --> 01:29:58.239 align:start position:0%
which as you know caused all kinds of
 
01:29:58.239 --> 01:29:59.830 align:start position:0%
which as you know caused all kinds of
workarounds
