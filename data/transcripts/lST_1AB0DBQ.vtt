1655 um this is this bill the intent of
 
00:08:00.869 --> 00:08:00.879 align:start position:0%
this bill is to bring how the funds that
 
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
the department collects for Teacher
 
00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
licensing for educated credentialing to
 
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
bring that um how those funds are uh
 
00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
transition from year to year into the
 
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
future uh in line with the fees for the
 
00:08:15.629 --> 00:08:15.639 align:start position:0%
higher education commission uh the
 
00:08:18.909 --> 00:08:18.919 align:start position:0%
higher education Commission in um
 
00:08:18.919 --> 00:08:20.830 align:start position:0%
higher education Commission in um
21n

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
21n
 
00:08:23.629 --> 00:08:23.639 align:start position:0%
8-a uh the higher ed commission there
 
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
specific language so that those funds do
 
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
not lapse they are other funds collected
 
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
for program review and used and then to
 
00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
to review future programs in the higher
 
00:08:36.029 --> 00:08:36.039 align:start position:0%
education world we would like to set up
 
00:08:38.469 --> 00:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
the credential and funds the same way
 
00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
currently today our accounting team at
 
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
the end of every fiscal year has to
 
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
ensure that they pull forward any
 
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
remaining funds into the new fiscal year
 
00:08:50.829 --> 00:08:50.839 align:start position:0%
and if they miss an account or two which
 
00:08:53.509 --> 00:08:53.519 align:start position:0%
sometimes happens um the the Bureau of
 
00:08:54.829 --> 00:08:54.839 align:start position:0%
credentialing doesn't have access to
 
00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
those funds for an entire fiscal year
 
00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:00.920 align:start position:0%
easily so um this would continuously
 
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:02.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate them and make sure that they
 
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:03.640 align:start position:0%
don't lapse that's the purpose of this
 
00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
bill the only question that we had on
 
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
our end again modeled it on 21 N8 that
 
00:09:14.829 --> 00:09:14.839 align:start position:0%
uh lists the the the fees to the higher
 
00:09:16.829 --> 00:09:16.839 align:start position:0%
education commission so we put down the
 
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
State Board in this
 
00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
legislation it could be amended to say
 
00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education if that's
 
00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:26.360 align:start position:0%
cleaner so it could be either uh either
 
00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
entity so to speak but the State Board
 
00:09:31.069 --> 00:09:31.079 align:start position:0%
is the ru making Authority that can set
 
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
fees uh and credentialing standards
 
00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:38.240 align:start position:0%
so happy to answer any questions thank
 
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:39.480 align:start position:0%

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:41.720 align:start position:0%

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
madam chair good morning good morning um
 
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
currently the fees are what for for U
 
00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:50.720 align:start position:0%
criminal background check oh for a
 
00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
criminal background check it's $100 okay
 
00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:55.240 align:start position:0%
and that that
 
00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:57.640 align:start position:0%
t yes followup thank you that may
 
00:10:01.829 --> 00:10:01.839 align:start position:0%
typically go to the the paid by the
 
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
applicant um thank you it depends right
 
00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:07.880 align:start position:0%
some some employers pay it I would say
 
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
it's probably 65 35 65% it's applicant
 
00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
35% employer thank you thank you m thank
 
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative Cornell
 
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
Thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
question which would make it easier to
 
00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
be administered by the State Board of
 
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
Education or the Department of Education
 
00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:28.600 align:start position:0%
or does it make I'm told it makes no
 
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
difference irand thank
 
00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
you representative Damon thank you
 
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question are the
 
00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:37.880 align:start position:0%
funds non- lapsing
 
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:41.200 align:start position:0%
now they do not lapse but for I don't
 
00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:43.880 align:start position:0%
understand all of State accounting
 
00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
um I I not sure how many folks truly do
 
00:10:49.949 --> 00:10:49.959 align:start position:0%
do yeah but but what happens is it's not
 
00:10:52.629 --> 00:10:52.639 align:start position:0%
that they lapse they're there but we
 
00:10:55.069 --> 00:10:55.079 align:start position:0%
can't always access
 
00:10:58.269 --> 00:10:58.279 align:start position:0%
them and I'm not sure you know the ins
 
00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
and outs the actual ual um uh
 
00:11:02.949 --> 00:11:02.959 align:start position:0%
technically why but I'm told this
 
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
language means that our accounting folks
 
00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
don't have to pull forward those funds
 
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
each year that they will automatically
 
00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:12.160 align:start position:0%
flow into the next fiscal year I'll
 
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
followup and if I understood correctly
 
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
from your introduction there are
 
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
multiple funds so we have a higher ed
 
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
commission fund right that's already an
 
00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:24.680 align:start position:0%
existing statute and then um we modeled
 
00:11:27.949 --> 00:11:27.959 align:start position:0%
language based on that for the Bureau of
 
00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
credentialing one
 
00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.069 align:start position:0%
credentialing one
more

00:11:32.069 --> 00:11:32.079 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
yes I think you said though that
 
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes some one of the existing maybe
 
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
they're not called funds oh I'm sorry
 
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
classes within a fund so in the state
 
00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:44.360 align:start position:0%
accounting system there are accounting
 
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
units and then within those units there
 
00:11:48.629 --> 00:11:48.639 align:start position:0%
are classes so there's a class for
 
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
full-time employees there's a class for
 
00:11:53.069 --> 00:11:53.079 align:start position:0%
benefits there's a class for
 
00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
um for part-time employees and so on
 
00:11:59.190 --> 00:11:59.200 align:start position:0%
class for oit you know it projects uh
 
00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:01.480 align:start position:0%
class for contractors there's all these
 
00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
you know I don't know 10 and something
 
00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
different classes and every one of those
 
00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:09.839 align:start position:0%
has to be pulled forward each year thank
 
00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:13.120 align:start position:0%

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:15.320 align:start position:0%

yes uh these fees thank you for the
 
00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
question these fees are collected the
 
00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:30.440 align:start position:0%
Bureau of cring receives no General fund
 
00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:33.839 align:start position:0%
funding so these fees and and we do
 
00:12:36.189 --> 00:12:36.199 align:start position:0%
re-evaluate them on a constant basis
 
00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:40.040 align:start position:0%
these fees uh strictly go to pay for the
 
00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:43.480 align:start position:0%
the actual work of processing educator
 
00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:54.040 align:start position:0%

1517 relative to the Statewide education
 
00:31:27.789 --> 00:31:27.799 align:start position:0%
property tax and excess Revenue from
 
00:31:30.029 --> 00:31:30.039 align:start position:0%
games of
 
00:31:32.549 --> 00:31:32.559 align:start position:0%
chance will you take any
 
00:31:39.549 --> 00:31:39.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:42.389 --> 00:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
you we have one pink card and I so I
 
00:31:44.789 --> 00:31:44.799 align:start position:0%
call on Mr Keen mang Juan from the New
 
00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:58.029 --> 00:31:58.039 align:start position:0%
Administration thank you for being here
 
00:31:59.870 --> 00:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
you're welcome good morning members of
 
00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:01.960 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Keen M Wong tax
 
00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
policy council with the New Hampshire
 
00:32:05.149 --> 00:32:05.159 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue the department
 
00:32:07.549 --> 00:32:07.559 align:start position:0%
does not have a position on this uh on
 
00:32:10.149 --> 00:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
this bill um however uh the department
 
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
did prepare a fiscal note and uh we're
 
00:32:14.269 --> 00:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
just here to provide some observations
 
00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:16.360 align:start position:0%
that we had uh so that the committee may
 
00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
consider that during their deliberation
 
00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:22.360 align:start position:0%
of this bill um
 
00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:24.269 align:start position:0%
of this bill um
so

00:32:24.269 --> 00:32:24.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:26.600 align:start position:0%
essentially uh reading of the reading of
 
00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:30.440 align:start position:0%
tells us that the uh the intent of the
 
00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
bill is to have the Dr when the Dr
 
00:32:36.909 --> 00:32:36.919 align:start position:0%
normally calculates the uh the the the
 
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
amount of taxes to collect a 363 swep
 
00:32:42.269 --> 00:32:42.279 align:start position:0%
amount a state education property tax
 
00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
amount uh the department will need to
 
00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:49.000 align:start position:0%
reduce that 363 by amount by this uh new
 
00:32:51.269 --> 00:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
amount that's from uh the newly
 
00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:54.799 align:start position:0%
established proposed established RSA 76
 
00:32:59.149 --> 00:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
colon 3- a um and that statute the
 
00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
proposed statute requires that the
 
00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:05.240 align:start position:0%
amount uh to be collected from the uh
 
00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:06.760 align:start position:0%
that's deposited into the education
 
00:33:27.389 --> 00:33:27.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:29.480 align:start position:0%
uh where games where chips have no
 
00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
monetary value um and then in games
 
00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
where chips with monetary value is 10%
 
00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:38.200 align:start position:0%
uh from the house winnings these are
 
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
deposited into the
 
00:33:42.549 --> 00:33:42.559 align:start position:0%
ETF and then according to the proposed
 
00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
bill um that amount anything in excess
 
00:33:49.029 --> 00:33:49.039 align:start position:0%
of $6.6 million will then be used to
 
00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:52.840 align:start position:0%
reduce the calculation of the 363
 
00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:55.950 align:start position:0%
reduce the calculation of the 363
million

00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:55.960 --> 00:34:00.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:02.389 --> 00:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
the effective date of this bill uh State
 
00:34:04.389 --> 00:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
the state effective date of this bill is
 
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
July one of
 
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
2024 uh the Dr took this to mean that it
 
00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:11.200 align:start position:0%
would impact the property taxes as
 
00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
assessed on April 1 of
 
00:34:17.349 --> 00:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
20125 um the concerns that the Dr has
 
00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:19.919 align:start position:0%
with this bill is that uh it does not
 
00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:22.399 align:start position:0%
clearly stipulate the date range for the
 
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
amount of payments that's been deposited
 
00:34:25.829 --> 00:34:25.839 align:start position:0%
to the ETF that's to be used to deduct
 
00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
the 363 million
 
00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:30.520 align:start position:0%
so that's not clear to the Dr and also
 
00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
um it's not clear how that amount will
 
00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
be determined um probably we would think
 
00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
that the best option would have would be
 
00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:42.520 align:start position:0%
to have the uh treasury to provide that
 
00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
number to the Dr so that we have a
 
00:34:48.069 --> 00:34:48.079 align:start position:0%
specific number to use for that um for
 
00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:51.200 align:start position:0%
any fiscal year to calculate the uh the
 
00:34:55.109 --> 00:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
new um the new swep amount um we think
 
00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
probably the best timing would be
 
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
sometime before September 1st um so that
 
00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
we can perform our calculations and
 
00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
provide the uh the necessary data for
 
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
Education as well because they need some
 
00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
information from us to to feed into
 
00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
their system to make their calculations
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
within a certain time
 
00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
frame Y and I'll be happy to take any
 
00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:19.160 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
 
00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:21.160 align:start position:0%
drive thank you madam chair and thank
 
00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:23.720 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question do you know
 
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
why they chose
 
00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:27.800 align:start position:0%
$6,600 th000
 
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
as their Benchmark I'm not sure but
 
00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
according to the bill it says it's the
 
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
amount that's estimated amount paid in
 
00:35:40.349 --> 00:35:40.359 align:start position:0%
the State uh 2023 fiscal year so um I'm
 
00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure um that might be through
 
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
the budget process that they obtained uh
 
00:35:49.829 --> 00:35:49.839 align:start position:0%
the 6.6 million thank
 
00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
you representative cascaden thank you
 
00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you for taking my
 
00:35:57.550 --> 00:35:57.560 align:start position:0%
question uh just so it's clear in my
 
00:35:59.349 --> 00:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
head I'm not sure I'm trying to
 
00:36:01.589 --> 00:36:01.599 align:start position:0%
interpret this does this mean that there
 
00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:06.680 align:start position:0%
is a cap of Revenue that would go into
 
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund at $363
 
00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
million and then the balance would go
 
00:36:16.829 --> 00:36:16.839 align:start position:0%
somewhere else
 
00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
potentially um I the way we read this
 
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
bill I don't think there's a movement of
 
00:36:25.589 --> 00:36:25.599 align:start position:0%
money essentially the money is in the
 
00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
education trust fund from the uh the
 
00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
collection from the games of chance um
 
00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
however we're just it's it seems like a
 
00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:37.480 align:start position:0%
mathematical change in the formula where
 
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
the amount that's access of $6.6 million
 
00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
it's still in the ETF it's not like
 
00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:44.200 align:start position:0%
that's going to be new money in um so
 
00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
that anything in excess of $6.6 million
 
00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:49.160 align:start position:0%
is going to be used to reduce the $363
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
million that we used to that's our
 
00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:54.200 align:start position:0%
Target every year the $63 million to
 
00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
calculate the the rate the tax rate to
 
00:36:59.750 --> 00:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
get to the $63 million okay so that $363
 
00:37:03.069 --> 00:37:03.079 align:start position:0%
million Target is going to be reduced by
 
00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:07.640 align:start position:0%
that excess over $6.6 million it's not
 
00:37:08.829 --> 00:37:08.839 align:start position:0%
that money is not going to be moved I
 
00:37:10.589 --> 00:37:10.599 align:start position:0%
don't think that's any movement of money
 
00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:12.920 align:start position:0%
from what I read in the bill um it's
 
00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
just a change in the formula in the
 
00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
calculation for the for the tax rate can
 
00:37:22.829 --> 00:37:22.839 align:start position:0%
I follow it yes so does that um decrease
 
00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
the amount in the education trust fund
 
00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:27.880 align:start position:0%
based on that change uh I I would think
 
00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:30.680 align:start position:0%
yes because uh this three without this
 
00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
change the 363 million uh although we
 
00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
don't collect that from the
 
00:37:38.309 --> 00:37:38.319 align:start position:0%
municipalities they're still considered
 
00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
revenue for the state and that will be
 
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
recorded as a revenue for the state so
 
00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
now this will be reducing the 363 by
 
00:37:46.109 --> 00:37:46.119 align:start position:0%
whatever amount that's going to be yeah
 
00:37:48.589 --> 00:37:48.599 align:start position:0%
okay I got it thank
 
00:37:52.589 --> 00:37:52.599 align:start position:0%
you question representative
 
00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:54.520 align:start position:0%
belter thank you madam chair thank you
 
00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
for your TCH support on this I just want
 
00:37:58.230 --> 00:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
to run the way that I'm interpreting
 
00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
this by you and see if you think this is
 
00:38:04.109 --> 00:38:04.119 align:start position:0%
correct so they're estimating that um
 
00:38:07.069 --> 00:38:07.079 align:start position:0%
games Jance gambling generated 6.6
 
00:38:09.309 --> 00:38:09.319 align:start position:0%
million or will generate 6.6 million
 
00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:12.680 align:start position:0%
from the 2023 fiscal year and what
 
00:38:15.069 --> 00:38:15.079 align:start position:0%
they're saying it seems to me is that in
 
00:38:18.349 --> 00:38:18.359 align:start position:0%
future years if Revenue people are
 
00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:20.440 align:start position:0%
feeling really lucky and they exceed
 
00:38:22.829 --> 00:38:22.839 align:start position:0%
that amount of revenue generated from
 
00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
gambling then the amount of extra beyond
 
00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
that 6.6 million directed to the
 
00:38:30.349 --> 00:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
education trust fund would then be um
 
00:38:34.829 --> 00:38:34.839 align:start position:0%
used to offset taxes from that would
 
00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:36.760 align:start position:0%
otherwise come directly from taxation
 
00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
into the trust fund is that basically
 
00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:40.280 align:start position:0%
right yeah that's that's my
 
00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
understanding as well thank
 
00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:38:47.589 --> 00:38:47.599 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you good morning thank you
 
00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
for helping
 
00:38:51.309 --> 00:38:51.319 align:start position:0%
us could you review what you said about
 
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
what the games of chance are and then I
 
00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:55.510 align:start position:0%
what the games of chance are and then I
have

00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:38:55.520 --> 00:39:00.230 align:start position:0%
have
a

00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
so essentially this is a current
 
00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:07.480 align:start position:0%
existing statute RSA 287 DD colon 20 uh
 
00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
Roman 1 says in games of chance where
 
00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
chips have no monetary
 
00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:16.280 align:start position:0%
value 3% of all funds collected from
 
00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
players uh less money used by the
 
00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:20.920 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission to fund authorized
 
00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
Personnel expenses and related costs
 
00:39:26.109 --> 00:39:26.119 align:start position:0%
shall be paid to the state treasurer and
 
00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
deposit into the special fund uh so
 
00:39:30.829 --> 00:39:30.839 align:start position:0%
that's a special fund that's created to
 
00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
be to that deposit that that accepts
 
00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
these these
 
00:39:39.069 --> 00:39:39.079 align:start position:0%
monies um and then uh Roman two in games
 
00:39:41.829 --> 00:39:41.839 align:start position:0%
of in games where chips have monetary
 
00:39:46.309 --> 00:39:46.319 align:start position:0%
value 10% of that um will be
 
00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:48.680 align:start position:0%
deposited yeah representative Damon
 
00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:50.920 align:start position:0%
followup So
 
00:39:53.109 --> 00:39:53.119 align:start position:0%
currently where are those funds being
 
00:39:55.870 --> 00:39:55.880 align:start position:0%
deposited are they going into the
 
00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
education trust fund but just not
 
00:39:59.589 --> 00:39:59.599 align:start position:0%
relating to swept or they're going
 
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
somewhere else they're going to this
 
00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
special fund RSA uh that's established
 
00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
in RSA
 
00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:18.190 align:start position:0%
 
2-j

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:18.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:20.829 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:40:20.829 --> 00:40:20.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:24.109 --> 00:40:24.119 align:start position:0%
and and it does go from what I read in
 
00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
the in 284 DH uh the 284 col 21 DJ it is
 
00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:31.720 align:start position:0%
still in the education trust fund it's
 
00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:34.720 align:start position:0%
not going towards swep not that I know
 
00:40:36.829 --> 00:40:36.839 align:start position:0%
of but currently it's it is deposited
 
00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
into the education trust
 
00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:43.720 align:start position:0%
fund one more follow thank
 
00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
you and correct me if I'm wrong in
 
00:40:50.589 --> 00:40:50.599 align:start position:0%
thinking that none of this relates to
 
00:40:54.109 --> 00:40:54.119 align:start position:0%
the lottery money I I do not know I'm
 
00:40:58.430 --> 00:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:01.589 --> 00:41:01.599 align:start position:0%

Madame chair and representative Paige
 
01:25:43.149 --> 01:25:43.159 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning in your
 
01:25:45.510 --> 01:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
presentation you mentioned the right to
 
01:25:48.030 --> 01:25:48.040 align:start position:0%
representation in school libraries could
 
01:25:50.070 --> 01:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
you please direct the committee to where
 
01:25:51.270 --> 01:25:51.280 align:start position:0%
this is written in
 
01:25:56.030 --> 01:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
law sure yep um it is part of having an
 
01:25:58.590 --> 01:25:58.600 align:start position:0%
equal Educational Opportunity um which
 
01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
is in this in the uh portion of Statute
 
01:26:03.750 --> 01:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
that's referenced in the bill if I may
 
01:26:07.149 --> 01:26:07.159 align:start position:0%
with a followup yes follow up um are the
 
01:26:09.350 --> 01:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
words right to representation in school
 
01:26:11.910 --> 01:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
libraries written in that statute if so
 
01:26:13.470 --> 01:26:13.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not familiar with that they are not
 
01:26:15.709 --> 01:26:15.719 align:start position:0%
explicitly written in the statute but I
 
01:26:18.350 --> 01:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
would argue that it's an inherent coraly
 
01:26:21.189 --> 01:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
of um equal opportunity thank
 
01:26:21.199 --> 01:26:23.950 align:start position:0%
of um equal opportunity thank
you

01:26:23.950 --> 01:26:23.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:25.830 align:start position:0%
you
representative

01:26:25.830 --> 01:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:26:28.149 --> 01:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
belter thank you madam chair and thank
 
01:26:32.470 --> 01:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
you rep Paige so it prohibits
 
01:26:34.229 --> 01:26:34.239 align:start position:0%
essentially removing books based on
 
01:26:37.189 --> 01:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint or Creed and Creed is simply
 
01:26:40.390 --> 01:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
defined as a a series of uh beliefs or
 
01:26:42.910 --> 01:26:42.920 align:start position:0%
opinions on a subject so it's very
 
01:26:46.629 --> 01:26:46.639 align:start position:0%
broad so some things that qualify as
 
01:26:49.030 --> 01:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
Creeds and viewpoints include Nazism
 
01:26:51.470 --> 01:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
fascism communism chauvinism Cults
 
01:26:52.709 --> 01:26:52.719 align:start position:0%
religions and
 
01:26:56.669 --> 01:26:56.679 align:start position:0%
nationalism So based on this rule if it
 
01:26:58.709 --> 01:26:58.719 align:start position:0%
were in place how would this apply to
 
01:27:01.510 --> 01:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
attempts to remove the book mind comp or
 
01:27:06.990 --> 01:27:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:09.270 --> 01:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
Eugenics thank you for the
 
01:27:12.950 --> 01:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
question I would humbly suggest that
 
01:27:15.229 --> 01:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
many of those books including mine comp
 
01:27:17.550 --> 01:27:17.560 align:start position:0%
which I'm sure everyone on this
 
01:27:22.550 --> 01:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
committee agrees is a terrible work have
 
01:27:25.750 --> 01:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
a have a purpose an educational purpose
 
01:27:28.750 --> 01:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
in a school library they may reference
 
01:27:31.030 --> 01:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
that book when they're doing a paper
 
01:27:35.149 --> 01:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
about that period in time so when we say
 
01:27:37.030 --> 01:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
that that book should be removed on the
 
01:27:39.390 --> 01:27:39.400 align:start position:0%
basis of its Viewpoint we're actually
 
01:27:43.550 --> 01:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
restricting uh our students ability to
 
01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
understand and research our
 
01:27:48.350 --> 01:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
history followup and if I may that leads
 
01:27:51.390 --> 01:27:51.400 align:start position:0%
right into the the perfect follow-up is
 
01:27:54.229 --> 01:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
at a foundation level
 
01:27:56.830 --> 01:27:56.840 align:start position:0%
parents um because they are funding this
 
01:27:59.310 --> 01:27:59.320 align:start position:0%
as taxpayers and they have the right to
 
01:28:01.310 --> 01:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
direct their own children's operting so
 
01:28:03.910 --> 01:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
why why should schools be required by
 
01:28:06.470 --> 01:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
law to make a par to make available
 
01:28:08.390 --> 01:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
materials that parents find
 
01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
objectionable and that they are that
 
01:28:12.030 --> 01:28:12.040 align:start position:0%
they say are subversive to their
 
01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:14.990 align:start position:0%
they say are subversive to their
foundational

01:28:14.990 --> 01:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:18.390 --> 01:28:18.400 align:start position:0%
values it's a fundamental principle of
 
01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:19.910 align:start position:0%
values it's a fundamental principle of
libraries

01:28:19.910 --> 01:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
libraries
 
01:28:24.109 --> 01:28:24.119 align:start position:0%
as places of volunt AR
 
01:28:27.149 --> 01:28:27.159 align:start position:0%
inquiry that everybody will find
 
01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
something in the library they don't
 
01:28:32.990 --> 01:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
like right you will find a book that you
 
01:28:35.950 --> 01:28:35.960 align:start position:0%
do not like in the library I will find a
 
01:28:38.590 --> 01:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
book that I do not like in the
 
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
library the purpose of the library is to
 
01:28:44.229 --> 01:28:44.239 align:start position:0%
serve all of those different
 
01:28:47.870 --> 01:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
students the job of the school librarian
 
01:28:49.229 --> 01:28:49.239 align:start position:0%
the professional the trained
 
01:28:50.990 --> 01:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
professional in that
 
01:28:54.870 --> 01:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
building is to help each student working
 
01:28:57.950 --> 01:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
with that student's family to find the
 
01:29:01.950 --> 01:29:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:05.109 --> 01:29:05.119 align:start position:0%
student if I may just one more last
 
01:29:07.109 --> 01:29:07.119 align:start position:0%
questiones thank you because it comes to
 
01:29:09.990 --> 01:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
the concept of voluntary inquiry which
 
01:29:12.669 --> 01:29:12.679 align:start position:0%
makes sense in a general Library concept
 
01:29:14.390 --> 01:29:14.400 align:start position:0%
but we're talking about schools so are
 
01:29:16.270 --> 01:29:16.280 align:start position:0%
you saying that children are never
 
01:29:18.590 --> 01:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
directed as a part of a class or by a
 
01:29:20.390 --> 01:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
teacher or by anyone else with authority
 
01:29:22.550 --> 01:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
over them in a school to to pursue
 
01:29:25.030 --> 01:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
certain books or certain ideas in a
 
01:29:27.590 --> 01:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
library those are two very different
 
01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:29.669 align:start position:0%
library those are two very different
things

01:29:29.669 --> 01:29:29.679 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:29:32.990 --> 01:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
so and this is this has been adjudicated
 
01:29:35.189 --> 01:29:35.199 align:start position:0%
all the way up to the Supreme Court
 
01:29:39.109 --> 01:29:39.119 align:start position:0%
there is the library is a space where a
 
01:29:42.709 --> 01:29:42.719 align:start position:0%
student is pursuing their own path where
 
01:29:45.990 --> 01:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
they are following their curiosity
 
01:29:47.550 --> 01:29:47.560 align:start position:0%
reading what interests
 
01:29:53.070 --> 01:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
them and that is uh that is where
 
01:29:55.149 --> 01:29:55.159 align:start position:0%
government has no role in overstepping
 
01:29:57.350 --> 01:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
and saying what that child can or cannot
 
01:29:59.550 --> 01:29:59.560 align:start position:0%
do the parent does of that specific
 
01:30:01.470 --> 01:30:01.480 align:start position:0%
child their own
 
01:30:04.149 --> 01:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
child that is different from the
 
01:30:06.149 --> 01:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
curriculum which is essentially
 
01:30:08.830 --> 01:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
government speech right so those are two
 
01:30:09.830 --> 01:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
different things you know if you're
 
01:30:13.030 --> 01:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
saying what is the school curriculum and
 
01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
how are they how are students directed
 
01:30:17.669 --> 01:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
that is subject to a different legal
 
01:30:19.870 --> 01:30:19.880 align:start position:0%
regime if you will than the library is a
 
01:30:24.910 --> 01:30:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:26.510 --> 01:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:30:28.669 --> 01:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
Miler thank you madam chair and thank
 
01:30:31.030 --> 01:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
you for being here represent
 
01:30:34.189 --> 01:30:34.199 align:start position:0%
paig in your development of this uh
 
01:30:37.070 --> 01:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation I'm sure you had a
 
01:30:41.790 --> 01:30:41.800 align:start position:0%
chance to talk with uh Librarians Etc
 
01:30:44.390 --> 01:30:44.400 align:start position:0%
what's their biggest fear as a librarian
 
01:30:48.870 --> 01:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:50.950 --> 01:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
information I don't want to speak for
 
01:30:53.510 --> 01:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
all librarians I'm sure different
 
01:30:55.870 --> 01:30:55.880 align:start position:0%
Librarians may have different
 
01:30:59.870 --> 01:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
perspectives um things that I hear
 
01:31:04.390 --> 01:31:04.400 align:start position:0%
regularly are that students may lose uh
 
01:31:06.709 --> 01:31:06.719 align:start position:0%
partic particularly marginalized
 
01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
students may lose access to materials
 
01:31:10.750 --> 01:31:10.760 align:start position:0%
that will help them navigate challenges
 
01:31:13.229 --> 01:31:13.239 align:start position:0%
in their lives um and I'm thinking here
 
01:31:17.030 --> 01:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
about lgbtq students uh students facing
 
01:31:21.149 --> 01:31:21.159 align:start position:0%
sexual trauma um and violence um so
 
01:31:23.030 --> 01:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
first and foremost I think Librarians as
 
01:31:25.470 --> 01:31:25.480 align:start position:0%
educators are thinking about their their
 
01:31:28.510 --> 01:31:28.520 align:start position:0%
students um something else that I think
 
01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
is um on the minds of many
 
01:31:37.350 --> 01:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
is the workforce itself and that lack of
 
01:31:39.629 --> 01:31:39.639 align:start position:0%
clarity around these
 
01:31:43.350 --> 01:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
issues um contributes to an environment
 
01:31:45.629 --> 01:31:45.639 align:start position:0%
where all these stakeholders don't know
 
01:31:47.750 --> 01:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
what is appropriate and not and that's
 
01:31:49.870 --> 01:31:49.880 align:start position:0%
why policies and procedures are
 
01:31:53.070 --> 01:31:53.080 align:start position:0%
important um it creates an environment
 
01:31:56.350 --> 01:31:56.360 align:start position:0%
where parents lack clarity about whether
 
01:31:59.030 --> 01:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
something is in Conformity with policy
 
01:32:02.550 --> 01:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
and where Librarians worry if um their
 
01:32:05.390 --> 01:32:05.400 align:start position:0%
administrators will have their back so
 
01:32:07.070 --> 01:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
making sure everybody throughout this
 
01:32:09.750 --> 01:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
ecosystem is on the same page help
 
01:32:12.189 --> 01:32:12.199 align:start position:0%
school librarians focus on their job
 
01:32:14.149 --> 01:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
which is serving students and it will
 
01:32:16.510 --> 01:32:16.520 align:start position:0%
help reduce burnout and helpfully keep
 
01:32:17.870 --> 01:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
keep school librarians and school
 
01:32:20.149 --> 01:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
libraries we're having a real issue um
 
01:32:21.709 --> 01:32:21.719 align:start position:0%
because of harassment that librarians
 
01:32:23.229 --> 01:32:23.239 align:start position:0%
you're facing and and keeping folks in
 
01:32:23.239 --> 01:32:24.870 align:start position:0%
you're facing and and keeping folks in
the

01:32:24.870 --> 01:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:32:30.990 --> 01:32:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:34.709 --> 01:32:34.719 align:start position:0%
leus one of the things I notice on here
 
01:32:34.719 --> 01:32:35.709 align:start position:0%
leus one of the things I notice on here
is

01:32:35.709 --> 01:32:35.719 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:32:40.430 --> 01:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
age and so I am wondering if you think
 
01:32:44.390 --> 01:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
that all materials are appropriate to
 
01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:45.669 align:start position:0%
that all materials are appropriate to
all

01:32:45.669 --> 01:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:32:48.310 --> 01:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
ages I don't think anybody would make
 
01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:49.390 align:start position:0%
ages I don't think anybody would make
that

01:32:49.390 --> 01:32:49.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:32:51.390 --> 01:32:51.400 align:start position:0%
contention and I think that that is
 
01:32:53.870 --> 01:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
where locally developed collection
 
01:32:56.030 --> 01:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
development policies come into
 
01:32:59.669 --> 01:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
play followup it's followup but it says
 
01:33:00.910 --> 01:33:00.920 align:start position:0%
that they
 
01:33:05.430 --> 01:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
can't um they can't prescribe materials
 
01:33:08.030 --> 01:33:08.040 align:start position:0%
on the basis of the subject's age so if
 
01:33:11.350 --> 01:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
they're told they can't then how can
 
01:33:13.669 --> 01:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
they take appro take that into
 
01:33:15.270 --> 01:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you for that
 
01:33:16.750 --> 01:33:16.760 align:start position:0%
question that's an important point of
 
01:33:18.430 --> 01:33:18.440 align:start position:0%
clarification when we're talking about
 
01:33:20.830 --> 01:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
age there we're not referencing the age
 
01:33:22.350 --> 01:33:22.360 align:start position:0%
of the reader
 
01:33:23.990 --> 01:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
we are referencing the age of the
 
01:33:27.790 --> 01:33:27.800 align:start position:0%
subject in the book or the author of the
 
01:33:30.750 --> 01:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
book it's thank you
 
01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
y further questions representative drag
 
01:33:36.189 --> 01:33:36.199 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman thank you for
 
01:33:37.910 --> 01:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question thank you um can we
 
01:33:40.430 --> 01:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
talk about the the process of appeal
 
01:33:42.669 --> 01:33:42.679 align:start position:0%
that you talked about would be like to
 
01:33:44.830 --> 01:33:44.840 align:start position:0%
principal superintendent does it go
 
01:33:47.109 --> 01:33:47.119 align:start position:0%
further than that to it to the State
 
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
Board of Education for example it does
 
01:33:52.590 --> 01:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
it does not and allows the Local
 
01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:53.629 align:start position:0%
it does not and allows the Local
District

01:33:53.629 --> 01:33:53.639 align:start position:0%
District
 
01:33:53.639 --> 01:33:55.229 align:start position:0%
District
to

01:33:55.229 --> 01:33:55.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:33:58.070 --> 01:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
um most of the details of that appeal
 
01:33:59.830 --> 01:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
process would be determined by The Local
 
01:34:02.229 --> 01:34:02.239 align:start position:0%
District and I think this relates to a
 
01:34:03.750 --> 01:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
brief conversation we had in another
 
01:34:06.390 --> 01:34:06.400 align:start position:0%
hearing recently um in that we're
 
01:34:09.030 --> 01:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
talking about Community standards and
 
01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
who is responsible for determining what
 
01:34:13.790 --> 01:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
community standards are in my opinion
 
01:34:16.229 --> 01:34:16.239 align:start position:0%
and I think the opinion of most that
 
01:34:19.390 --> 01:34:19.400 align:start position:0%
should be defined by your locally
 
01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
elected board because
 
01:34:24.109 --> 01:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
they're the people of the community
 
01:34:25.629 --> 01:34:25.639 align:start position:0%
they're the standards we're trying to
 
01:34:29.070 --> 01:34:29.080 align:start position:0%
reflect um so that's that's my take on
 
01:34:31.070 --> 01:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
that question is that it should belongs
 
01:34:33.270 --> 01:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
within the district thank you follow and
 
01:34:35.109 --> 01:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
I agree um that's what we're trying to
 
01:34:38.189 --> 01:34:38.199 align:start position:0%
but I just wanted I think the idea is
 
01:34:41.310 --> 01:34:41.320 align:start position:0%
that due process includes that step uh
 
01:34:44.070 --> 01:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
for for parents that have a problem with
 
01:34:46.350 --> 01:34:46.360 align:start position:0%
the the decision yeah and that yes and
 
01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
that a standard best practice okay thank
 
01:34:51.470 --> 01:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
you any further questions thank you
 
01:34:52.910 --> 01:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative Paige
 
01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:55.510 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative Paige
thank

01:34:55.510 --> 01:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:04.870 --> 01:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:06.590 --> 01:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
gerana thank you very much
 
01:35:08.950 --> 01:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
representative peternell colleagues
 
01:35:11.709 --> 01:35:11.719 align:start position:0%
Madam chairman Madam chair thank you
 
01:35:14.910 --> 01:35:14.920 align:start position:0%
madam chair fellow Representatives uh
 
01:35:16.350 --> 01:35:16.360 align:start position:0%
I'm going to take a slightly different
 
01:35:18.910 --> 01:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
approach uh and speak to this
 
01:35:21.070 --> 01:35:21.080 align:start position:0%
legislation from the perspective of a
 
01:35:22.669 --> 01:35:22.679 align:start position:0%
professor at one of our public
 
01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
institutions of higher
 
01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
education it's important not only for
 
01:35:29.149 --> 01:35:29.159 align:start position:0%
our young people to see their own life
 
01:35:31.270 --> 01:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
experiences represented in the
 
01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
literature that they read it's also
 
01:35:34.910 --> 01:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
really important for them to be able to
 
01:35:36.870 --> 01:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
see the lived experiences of people who
 
01:35:39.270 --> 01:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
are not like them represented in the
 
01:35:41.669 --> 01:35:41.679 align:start position:0%
things that they have access
 
01:35:45.109 --> 01:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
to more than a third of our students at
 
01:35:47.189 --> 01:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
Kean State College where I teach are
 
01:35:49.109 --> 01:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
still first generation college students
 
01:35:51.590 --> 01:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
we continue to have a a high percentage
 
01:35:53.149 --> 01:35:53.159 align:start position:0%
each year with our incoming class of
 
01:35:55.870 --> 01:35:55.880 align:start position:0%
first generation students a lot of them
 
01:35:59.109 --> 01:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
come from small towns just as I did uh
 
01:36:02.310 --> 01:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
when I went to college in the early 90s
 
01:36:04.550 --> 01:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to say you know describe
 
01:36:06.310 --> 01:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
for you very briefly a book that I read
 
01:36:08.790 --> 01:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
when I was 15 years old book that there
 
01:36:11.510 --> 01:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
have been innumerable efforts to ban in
 
01:36:12.990 --> 01:36:13.000 align:start position:0%
public schools since it was first
 
01:36:15.510 --> 01:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
published in 1940 and that is Richard
 
01:36:18.149 --> 01:36:18.159 align:start position:0%
writes novel native son it's a
 
01:36:20.990 --> 01:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
controversial book still for some it
 
01:36:24.189 --> 01:36:24.199 align:start position:0%
repr reprs interracial sex sexual
 
01:36:28.430 --> 01:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
violence systemic racism communism and
 
01:36:30.510 --> 01:36:30.520 align:start position:0%
for all of these reasons there have been
 
01:36:33.350 --> 01:36:33.360 align:start position:0%
over and over again uh attempts to
 
01:36:35.550 --> 01:36:35.560 align:start position:0%
remove this book from not only Public
 
01:36:38.189 --> 01:36:38.199 align:start position:0%
School curriculum but from public school
 
01:36:40.950 --> 01:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
libraries uh this uh this book uh is
 
01:36:42.950 --> 01:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
widely recognized as a classic of
 
01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
American literature uh and it is a book
 
01:36:50.510 --> 01:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
that meant a great deal to me as I was
 
01:36:54.470 --> 01:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
just beginning to be exposed to ideas
 
01:36:56.229 --> 01:36:56.239 align:start position:0%
that were very much outside the bubble
 
01:36:58.669 --> 01:36:58.679 align:start position:0%
in which I grew up and I can tell you as
 
01:37:02.350 --> 01:37:02.360 align:start position:0%
somebody who works with uh our College
 
01:37:04.310 --> 01:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
age students here in New Hampshire every
 
01:37:06.990 --> 01:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
day uh as someone who is taught at some
 
01:37:09.310 --> 01:37:09.320 align:start position:0%
elite private institutions but is also
 
01:37:11.470 --> 01:37:11.480 align:start position:0%
deeply committed to public liberal arts
 
01:37:13.510 --> 01:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
education uh that a lot of her students
 
01:37:14.950 --> 01:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
are coming from backgrounds that are
 
01:37:18.590 --> 01:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
still in 2024 not dissimilar from the
 
01:37:21.910 --> 01:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
background I came from uh I don't like
 
01:37:23.470 --> 01:37:23.480 align:start position:0%
to say how long
 
01:37:26.390 --> 01:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
ago having students prepared when they
 
01:37:29.950 --> 01:37:29.960 align:start position:0%
enter the classroom and higher education
 
01:37:32.270 --> 01:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
or when they enter the workforce after
 
01:37:34.430 --> 01:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
that but obviously my area specifically
 
01:37:37.590 --> 01:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
is is dealing with uh with college uh
 
01:37:41.669 --> 01:37:41.679 align:start position:0%
having them begin to explore the lives
 
01:37:43.870 --> 01:37:43.880 align:start position:0%
of people who are different from them
 
01:37:46.669 --> 01:37:46.679 align:start position:0%
experiences of people who are different
 
01:37:48.910 --> 01:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
uh than they are is a critical part of
 
01:37:51.350 --> 01:37:51.360 align:start position:0%
the process uh especially in the high
 
01:37:53.189 --> 01:37:53.199 align:start position:0%
school years of preparing you to be able
 
01:37:55.310 --> 01:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
to go out into the world if you are
 
01:37:58.070 --> 01:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
going to be a learner if you are going
 
01:38:00.350 --> 01:38:00.360 align:start position:0%
to successfully be able to navigate and
 
01:38:02.750 --> 01:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
to engage your wider World it doesn't
 
01:38:06.310 --> 01:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
just happen overnight it is a process of
 
01:38:08.990 --> 01:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
Engagement with new ideas and new
 
01:38:11.229 --> 01:38:11.239 align:start position:0%
experiences that has to begin at a
 
01:38:13.350 --> 01:38:13.360 align:start position:0%
younger age and our Librarians are
 
01:38:16.390 --> 01:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
trained Professionals in understanding
 
01:38:19.510 --> 01:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
Child Development and introducing
 
01:38:22.990 --> 01:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
students to a apprpriate material as
 
01:38:25.709 --> 01:38:25.719 align:start position:0%
they age through our school system and
 
01:38:27.589 --> 01:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
then prepare to move out into the world
 
01:38:31.830 --> 01:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
Beyond high school so uh I see this bill
 
01:38:34.390 --> 01:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
as protecting policies that are for the
 
01:38:37.229 --> 01:38:37.239 align:start position:0%
most part already in place protecting
 
01:38:39.270 --> 01:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
local control these are policies that
 
01:38:41.149 --> 01:38:41.159 align:start position:0%
are uh going to
 
01:38:45.390 --> 01:38:45.400 align:start position:0%
be formulated at the local level parents
 
01:38:49.109 --> 01:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
as well as Library professionals have an
 
01:38:51.870 --> 01:38:51.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to see all all of these
 
01:38:54.790 --> 01:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
policies they are transparent they are
 
01:38:57.470 --> 01:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
fair they are
 
01:39:00.990 --> 01:39:01.000 align:start position:0%
Equitable and they're able to engage in
 
01:39:03.430 --> 01:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
discussions within their Community about
 
01:39:05.149 --> 01:39:05.159 align:start position:0%
the standards that they think ought to
 
01:39:07.830 --> 01:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
be reflected in these uh in these
 
01:39:10.950 --> 01:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
policies so I see this bill as something
 
01:39:14.189 --> 01:39:14.199 align:start position:0%
that as I said protects what public
 
01:39:15.790 --> 01:39:15.800 align:start position:0%
education should be about which is
 
01:39:17.470 --> 01:39:17.480 align:start position:0%
preparing our students to engage in a
 
01:39:20.070 --> 01:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
wider world but doing so in a way that
 
01:39:22.390 --> 01:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
still allows these conversations to be
 
01:39:24.790 --> 01:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
had between Library professionals and
 
01:39:27.750 --> 01:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
students and parents policies to be
 
01:39:29.589 --> 01:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
transparent fair and Equitable and
 
01:39:31.350 --> 01:39:31.360 align:start position:0%
determined at the local
 
01:39:34.830 --> 01:39:34.840 align:start position:0%
level thank you very much any questions
 
01:39:36.510 --> 01:39:36.520 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry are you willing to take
 
01:39:37.950 --> 01:39:37.960 align:start position:0%
questions I am thank you madam chair
 
01:39:40.750 --> 01:39:40.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:39:42.870 --> 01:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
beler thank you madam chair and thank
 
01:39:45.870 --> 01:39:45.880 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony um I believe you
 
01:39:48.229 --> 01:39:48.239 align:start position:0%
said you had been a professor can speak
 
01:39:50.310 --> 01:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
from that perspective when you opened up
 
01:39:53.189 --> 01:39:53.199 align:start position:0%
you you referenced uh the concept that
 
01:39:55.709 --> 01:39:55.719 align:start position:0%
students need to hear stories that are
 
01:39:57.870 --> 01:39:57.880 align:start position:0%
read stories that are different than
 
01:39:59.790 --> 01:39:59.800 align:start position:0%
their experiences and involve people who
 
01:40:02.310 --> 01:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
look different and are different and I
 
01:40:04.310 --> 01:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
just wanted to ask is that is that a
 
01:40:06.669 --> 01:40:06.679 align:start position:0%
reference sort of to the the idea of of
 
01:40:09.270 --> 01:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
quote quote windows and doors uh which
 
01:40:11.950 --> 01:40:11.960 align:start position:0%
is rooted in a standpoint epistemology
 
01:40:15.790 --> 01:40:15.800 align:start position:0%
and critical or social constructivist
 
01:40:18.790 --> 01:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
theory thank you for the question no
 
01:40:20.510 --> 01:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
it's a reflection of my experience in
 
01:40:24.750 --> 01:40:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:27.189 --> 01:40:27.199 align:start position:0%
education thank you any further
 
01:40:28.990 --> 01:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much
 
01:40:32.750 --> 01:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
representative ger thank you madam
 
01:40:45.910 --> 01:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:49.350 --> 01:40:49.360 align:start position:0%
Beerman thank you madam chairman good
 
01:40:52.310 --> 01:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
morning um I am am here to give
 
01:40:55.669 --> 01:40:55.679 align:start position:0%
testimony um opposing this
 
01:40:55.679 --> 01:40:57.669 align:start position:0%
testimony um opposing this
bill

01:40:57.669 --> 01:40:57.679 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:41:01.589 --> 01:41:01.599 align:start position:0%
um I am very concerned about the fact
 
01:41:04.229 --> 01:41:04.239 align:start position:0%
that if a parent has a concerned about a
 
01:41:08.950 --> 01:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
book that um we are taking in account
 
01:41:12.669 --> 01:41:12.679 align:start position:0%
who the author is um instead of
 
01:41:14.629 --> 01:41:14.639 align:start position:0%
concentrating more on the content and
 
01:41:18.149 --> 01:41:18.159 align:start position:0%
the quality of the content in the book
 
01:41:23.109 --> 01:41:23.119 align:start position:0%
um and when they're listing all of their
 
01:41:26.030 --> 01:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
um criteria I see that there's no
 
01:41:28.550 --> 01:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
mention of religion why are we leaving
 
01:41:29.950 --> 01:41:29.960 align:start position:0%
religion out if we're going to put every
 
01:41:32.189 --> 01:41:32.199 align:start position:0%
little aspect of a person's life
 
01:41:35.910 --> 01:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
religion should be included in that
 
01:41:39.990 --> 01:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
um and if we are going to start saying
 
01:41:42.109 --> 01:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
that we need to have authors in all of
 
01:41:44.950 --> 01:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
these different criterias then are we
 
01:41:46.750 --> 01:41:46.760 align:start position:0%
going to start making quotas that a
 
01:41:49.350 --> 01:41:49.360 align:start position:0%
school district has to have authors and
 
01:41:52.270 --> 01:41:52.280 align:start position:0%
so many in each of these
 
01:41:56.390 --> 01:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
criteria um I'm also concerned about um
 
01:42:00.030 --> 01:42:00.040 align:start position:0%
RSA 571 obscene materials uh we were
 
01:42:03.950 --> 01:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
told in another hearing that um if
 
01:42:06.109 --> 01:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
there's obscene materials in a library
 
01:42:08.870 --> 01:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
that we should be able to take them out
 
01:42:11.950 --> 01:42:11.960 align:start position:0%
but if the author meets one of these
 
01:42:13.709 --> 01:42:13.719 align:start position:0%
criteria are we not going to be able to
 
01:42:15.629 --> 01:42:15.639 align:start position:0%
take the books out is that going to be
 
01:42:17.109 --> 01:42:17.119 align:start position:0%
something that's going to make it
 
01:42:18.830 --> 01:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
difficult for a parent to have that book
 
01:42:22.669 --> 01:42:22.679 align:start position:0%
taken out um um another thing when we
 
01:42:27.189 --> 01:42:27.199 align:start position:0%
were talking about HB 1419 about harmful
 
01:42:29.870 --> 01:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
and obscene materials in the school
 
01:42:34.430 --> 01:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:38.189 --> 01:42:38.199 align:start position:0%
uh bill um we did say that we would have
 
01:42:41.229 --> 01:42:41.239 align:start position:0%
a chance for the parents to actually um
 
01:42:43.550 --> 01:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
go to the State Board of Education if
 
01:42:46.430 --> 01:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
their local board was not um producing
 
01:42:48.270 --> 01:42:48.280 align:start position:0%
results that they thought needed to
 
01:42:51.070 --> 01:42:51.080 align:start position:0%
happen and in that testimony most of
 
01:42:53.390 --> 01:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
them were talking about local control
 
01:42:55.550 --> 01:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
and that these decisions should be made
 
01:42:58.070 --> 01:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
locally I've looked up at my school
 
01:43:00.109 --> 01:43:00.119 align:start position:0%
board policy and we already have school
 
01:43:03.270 --> 01:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
policy on acquiring Library material
 
01:43:06.790 --> 01:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
it's policy igl and JJ
 
01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:08.390 align:start position:0%
it's policy igl and JJ
L-R

01:43:08.390 --> 01:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
L-R
 
01:43:11.510 --> 01:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
so in one instance you're saying no we
 
01:43:13.510 --> 01:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
can't have this bill because we need to
 
01:43:15.070 --> 01:43:15.080 align:start position:0%
have local control but now we have this
 
01:43:17.669 --> 01:43:17.679 align:start position:0%
other Bill saying we want to put all
 
01:43:19.510 --> 01:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
these restrictions on and not leave it
 
01:43:21.910 --> 01:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
up to local control very
 
01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:23.589 align:start position:0%
up to local control very
confusing

01:43:23.589 --> 01:43:23.599 align:start position:0%
confusing
 
01:43:27.350 --> 01:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
um and as far as the Librarians um
 
01:43:29.510 --> 01:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
they're not trained school psychologist
 
01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:30.310 align:start position:0%
they're not trained school psychologist
and

01:43:30.310 --> 01:43:30.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:43:32.669 --> 01:43:32.679 align:start position:0%
psychiatrists and they don't have the
 
01:43:34.550 --> 01:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
knowledge in the background to be
 
01:43:36.990 --> 01:43:37.000 align:start position:0%
prescribing what books a child should
 
01:43:39.030 --> 01:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
have if that child has had trauma or any
 
01:43:43.790 --> 01:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
other experience in their life um they
 
01:43:45.189 --> 01:43:45.199 align:start position:0%
yeah they took one child development
 
01:43:47.830 --> 01:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
class that does not qualify them as
 
01:43:50.189 --> 01:43:50.199 align:start position:0%
being professionals and having any kind
 
01:43:53.870 --> 01:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
of information that would give them the
 
01:43:56.070 --> 01:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
right to say hey read this book and this
 
01:43:57.990 --> 01:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
will make all your problems go
 
01:44:00.589 --> 01:44:00.599 align:start position:0%
away um and
 
01:44:05.510 --> 01:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
then I just am just against all of this
 
01:44:07.470 --> 01:44:07.480 align:start position:0%
and most school librarians these days
 
01:44:09.430 --> 01:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
are following the American Library
 
01:44:11.350 --> 01:44:11.360 align:start position:0%
Association and I have a very big
 
01:44:12.910 --> 01:44:12.920 align:start position:0%
concern about the person who's in charge
 
01:44:16.189 --> 01:44:16.199 align:start position:0%
of it because she is a self-proclaimed

that that as um what public school
 
01:44:57.669 --> 01:44:57.679 align:start position:0%
librarians doing that what I see is a
 
01:44:59.310 --> 01:44:59.320 align:start position:0%
youngster coming in asking about a
 
01:45:01.510 --> 01:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
subject area in the librarian providing
 
01:45:03.669 --> 01:45:03.679 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for youngsters to explore
 
01:45:06.790 --> 01:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
areas that the child has has um asked
 
01:45:09.149 --> 01:45:09.159 align:start position:0%
about versus saying this is going to I'm
 
01:45:12.070 --> 01:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
not they don't come in and work as a
 
01:45:14.589 --> 01:45:14.599 align:start position:0%
therapist or a person of that nature or
 
01:45:16.910 --> 01:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
counselor I I see it much differently
 
01:45:18.189 --> 01:45:18.199 align:start position:0%
than that and so I just wondering how
 
01:45:19.870 --> 01:45:19.880 align:start position:0%
you picked up that you thought that the
 
01:45:22.589 --> 01:45:22.599 align:start position:0%
librarians might supersede their skill
 
01:45:24.550 --> 01:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
level and try to be therapist when
 
01:45:25.990 --> 01:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
youngsters are actually going there to
 
01:45:28.070 --> 01:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
find information about
 
01:45:30.629 --> 01:45:30.639 align:start position:0%
issues I have seen reports that say
 
01:45:32.149 --> 01:45:32.159 align:start position:0%
otherwise that Librarians are
 
01:45:34.830 --> 01:45:34.840 align:start position:0%
overstepping their boundaries and they
 
01:45:37.790 --> 01:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
are taking on the role of social worker
 
01:45:41.030 --> 01:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
psychologist and not just librarian and
 
01:45:43.470 --> 01:45:43.480 align:start position:0%

01:46:04.629 --> 01:46:04.639 align:start position:0%
libraries where the Librarians have

a supreme court precedent on Independent
 
01:46:29.270 --> 01:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
inquiry so it's important that students

be able to according to this access this
 
01:46:33.910 --> 01:46:33.920 align:start position:0%

concept ofis
 
01:47:49.950 --> 01:47:49.960 align:start position:0%
Presley um I that would have to go
 
01:47:53.229 --> 01:47:53.239 align:start position:0%
through a screening process of what
 
01:47:56.510 --> 01:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
people consider obscene sexual uh
 
01:47:59.310 --> 01:47:59.320 align:start position:0%
material but that's not what this that's
 
01:48:00.830 --> 01:48:00.840 align:start position:0%

function from the library
 
01:48:47.990 --> 01:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
standpoint um the assignment was

focusing on students looking up uh rape
 
01:48:58.229 --> 01:48:58.239 align:start position:0%

know we did not take a position on that
 
01:50:36.430 --> 01:50:36.440 align:start position:0%
bill because we thought um it had um
 
01:50:40.030 --> 01:50:40.040 align:start position:0%
some Merit nhsp fully supports um
 
01:50:42.430 --> 01:50:42.440 align:start position:0%
requiring in statute School boards to

01:50:50.629 --> 01:50:50.639 align:start position:0%
development for for the district's
 
01:50:53.709 --> 01:50:53.719 align:start position:0%
library media centers um our preference
 
01:50:57.870 --> 01:50:57.880 align:start position:0%
over uh House Bill uh 1311 um over uh
 
01:50:59.790 --> 01:50:59.800 align:start position:0%
representative cordell's bill was the
 
01:51:01.870 --> 01:51:01.880 align:start position:0%
policy requirements um that were in
 
01:51:03.950 --> 01:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
representative cordell's Bill really
 
01:51:05.790 --> 01:51:05.800 align:start position:0%
listed out what the policy was supposed
 
01:51:08.030 --> 01:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
to be there was no not much room for
 
01:51:10.870 --> 01:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
local maneuvering developing or crafting
 
01:51:12.550 --> 01:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
their own local policy it was very
 
01:51:14.790 --> 01:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
restrictive in terms of dates and times
 
01:51:17.589 --> 01:51:17.599 align:start position:0%
and 30 days and who reviews it first and
 
01:51:19.390 --> 01:51:19.400 align:start position:0%
where it goes on you know on a second
 
01:51:21.510 --> 01:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
step and and and whatnot which are are
 
01:51:23.109 --> 01:51:23.119 align:start position:0%
those are fine Provisions if some
 
01:51:25.430 --> 01:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
districts want to want to implement
 
01:51:27.629 --> 01:51:27.639 align:start position:0%
those um but we feel that the provisions
 
01:51:30.550 --> 01:51:30.560 align:start position:0%
of House Bill 1311 um give local
 
01:51:32.870 --> 01:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
districts more flexibility recognizing
 
01:51:34.629 --> 01:51:34.639 align:start position:0%
that Manchester may want to have a
 
01:51:36.270 --> 01:51:36.280 align:start position:0%
different process cook may want to have
 
01:51:38.629 --> 01:51:38.639 align:start position:0%
a different process um I'm aware that
 
01:51:41.310 --> 01:51:41.320 align:start position:0%
there was um a hearing maybe two or
 
01:51:44.750 --> 01:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
three months ago um in do um I you know
 
01:51:46.830 --> 01:51:46.840 align:start position:0%
I I spoke with the superintendent in do
 
01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
about the process that they used and the
 
01:51:51.069 --> 01:51:51.079 align:start position:0%
process that they engaged and including
 
01:51:52.830 --> 01:51:52.840 align:start position:0%
different voices from from across the
 
01:51:55.310 --> 01:51:55.320 align:start position:0%
community and we think that the um the
 
01:51:57.470 --> 01:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
provisions um in House Bill 1311 would
 
01:51:59.149 --> 01:51:59.159 align:start position:0%
allow local school boards the
 
01:52:00.870 --> 01:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
flexibility to do that again coming back
 
01:52:02.950 --> 01:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
to sort of the local customs and local
 
01:52:05.069 --> 01:52:05.079 align:start position:0%
values um that we've heard some
 
01:52:06.790 --> 01:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
discussion about local Community Values
 
01:52:09.470 --> 01:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
determining what's in their Library so
 
01:52:11.550 --> 01:52:11.560 align:start position:0%
uh we already have some sample policies
 
01:52:13.830 --> 01:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
on these topics um we have a sample
 
01:52:18.510 --> 01:52:18.520 align:start position:0%
policy on um curriculum development um
 
01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh parental objection to course
 
01:52:24.069 --> 01:52:24.079 align:start position:0%
materials um Library selection and
 
01:52:27.069 --> 01:52:27.079 align:start position:0%
adoption curriculum adoption um and
 
01:52:29.550 --> 01:52:29.560 align:start position:0%
reconsideration of instruction materials
 
01:52:31.350 --> 01:52:31.360 align:start position:0%
uh these policies have have not been
 
01:52:33.990 --> 01:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
updated in a number of years um
 
01:52:35.669 --> 01:52:35.679 align:start position:0%
primarily because they haven't had to
 
01:52:38.629 --> 01:52:38.639 align:start position:0%
previously um but sort of given the the
 
01:52:41.270 --> 01:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
the current tenor and some bills in this
 
01:52:43.069 --> 01:52:43.079 align:start position:0%
legislature and bills across the country
 
01:52:45.069 --> 01:52:45.079 align:start position:0%
and book challenges it's certainly on
 
01:52:47.550 --> 01:52:47.560 align:start position:0%
our radar um you know whether or not a
 
01:52:50.510 --> 01:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
bill passes um relative to this you know
 
01:52:52.149 --> 01:52:52.159 align:start position:0%
we're going to be looking at our sample
 
01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
policies and see what may needs to be
 
01:52:56.030 --> 01:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
updated on them and perhaps get get the
 
01:52:57.950 --> 01:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
voice of some school board members um
 
01:52:59.750 --> 01:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
who are probably parents most school
 
01:53:00.950 --> 01:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
board members or many school board
 
01:53:02.310 --> 01:53:02.320 align:start position:0%
members are parents let's not forget
 
01:53:04.750 --> 01:53:04.760 align:start position:0%
that fact as well too um media
 
01:53:06.790 --> 01:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
Specialists superintendant and and
 
01:53:08.550 --> 01:53:08.560 align:start position:0%
school board members to help sort of
 
01:53:11.550 --> 01:53:11.560 align:start position:0%
Craft um a a policy that can help
 
01:53:13.830 --> 01:53:13.840 align:start position:0%
parents navigate um their local school
 
01:53:15.149 --> 01:53:15.159 align:start position:0%
board their local school district when
 
01:53:16.830 --> 01:53:16.840 align:start position:0%
they want to challenge on whether it's a
 
01:53:18.990 --> 01:53:19.000 align:start position:0%
a book in the library or or a course
 
01:53:20.430 --> 01:53:20.440 align:start position:0%
material so
 
01:53:22.830 --> 01:53:22.840 align:start position:0%
um with that I'm happy to answer any
 
01:53:25.750 --> 01:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
questions any questions representative
 
01:53:27.990 --> 01:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
cascaden thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:53:29.510 --> 01:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
Barrett for taking my
 
01:53:31.950 --> 01:53:31.960 align:start position:0%
question I'm having a hard time
 
01:53:34.910 --> 01:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
distinguishing what this bill would do
 
01:53:37.229 --> 01:53:37.239 align:start position:0%
um in terms of revising the policy so
 
01:53:40.470 --> 01:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
maybe there's something particular to um
 
01:53:43.229 --> 01:53:43.239 align:start position:0%
local communities or policies I'm
 
01:53:44.750 --> 01:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
talking about as I worked with since
 
01:53:49.149 --> 01:53:49.159 align:start position:0%
2011 and 12 is what they're dated JK igl
 
01:53:53.030 --> 01:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
kec C kc- KC
 
01:53:55.669 --> 01:53:55.679 align:start position:0%
k-r I mean those are all the last two
 
01:53:55.679 --> 01:53:56.390 align:start position:0%
k-r I mean those are all the last two
are

01:53:56.390 --> 01:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:53:58.709 --> 01:53:58.719 align:start position:0%
reconsideration right of materials as
 
01:54:00.870 --> 01:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
you know and you pointed out would it
 
01:54:03.870 --> 01:54:03.880 align:start position:0%
just update one of those policies or
 
01:54:05.390 --> 01:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
what would it do different sure thank
 
01:54:06.390 --> 01:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
you very much for the question
 
01:54:08.709 --> 01:54:08.719 align:start position:0%
representative um while the policy while
 
01:54:11.109 --> 01:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
the nhsb sample policy itself may not
 
01:54:13.709 --> 01:54:13.719 align:start position:0%
need to necessarily be updated we would
 
01:54:16.390 --> 01:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
probably revise you're probably familiar
 
01:54:19.109 --> 01:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
with the- RS that we use the regulations
 
01:54:21.550 --> 01:54:21.560 align:start position:0%
in addition to sample policies nhba also
 
01:54:23.510 --> 01:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
provides sample regulations we
 
01:54:26.950 --> 01:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
categorize those- R which are process
 
01:54:28.870 --> 01:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
procedures more they read more like
 
01:54:31.149 --> 01:54:31.159 align:start position:0%
administrative rules we would probably
 
01:54:33.510 --> 01:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
do some research and again this
 
01:54:34.790 --> 01:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
committee may remember when we had a
 
01:54:37.189 --> 01:54:37.199 align:start position:0%
bill last year I provided maybe eight or
 
01:54:39.069 --> 01:54:39.079 align:start position:0%
10 policies that local school districts
 
01:54:41.069 --> 01:54:41.079 align:start position:0%
were using I forget what bill number
 
01:54:42.990 --> 01:54:43.000 align:start position:0%
that was I don't know if Jen maybe still
 
01:54:44.830 --> 01:54:44.840 align:start position:0%
has those on file not making more more
 
01:54:47.069 --> 01:54:47.079 align:start position:0%
work for to pull those to pull those out
 
01:54:48.629 --> 01:54:48.639 align:start position:0%
I'm not asking that but we would
 
01:54:50.709 --> 01:54:50.719 align:start position:0%
probably provide some sort of guidance
 
01:54:53.830 --> 01:54:53.840 align:start position:0%
to districts into creating the Review
 
01:54:56.629 --> 01:54:56.639 align:start position:0%
Committee um maybe a guidance document
 
01:54:59.189 --> 01:54:59.199 align:start position:0%
for the Review Committee should consider
 
01:55:01.149 --> 01:55:01.159 align:start position:0%
these things the Review Committee should
 
01:55:03.390 --> 01:55:03.400 align:start position:0%
you know look for these attributes um so
 
01:55:05.030 --> 01:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
maybe not the policy per se but some
 
01:55:07.229 --> 01:55:07.239 align:start position:0%
additional guidance to our to our school
 
01:55:09.629 --> 01:55:09.639 align:start position:0%
boards in helping them navigate the
 
01:55:11.350 --> 01:55:11.360 align:start position:0%
process of their policy or their or
 
01:55:13.149 --> 01:55:13.159 align:start position:0%
their procedure thank
 
01:55:16.470 --> 01:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
you representative beler thank you madam
 
01:55:18.189 --> 01:55:18.199 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for your testimony
 
01:55:21.270 --> 01:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
you opened with um a position statement
 
01:55:24.430 --> 01:55:24.440 align:start position:0%
stating that you affirmed the
 
01:55:27.629 --> 01:55:27.639 align:start position:0%
qualifications of the local um Personnel
 
01:55:29.430 --> 01:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
to make these decisions can you speak
 
01:55:31.470 --> 01:55:31.480 align:start position:0%
more to What specifically confers to
 
01:55:33.510 --> 01:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
them that qualification to make these
 
01:55:35.430 --> 01:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
sure thank you very much representative
 
01:55:37.550 --> 01:55:37.560 align:start position:0%
I do know that library media specialist
 
01:55:39.589 --> 01:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
is a um a certification through the
 
01:55:41.430 --> 01:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Education what that
 
01:55:42.870 --> 01:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
entails without looking at the rule I
 
01:55:44.510 --> 01:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
don't know but it is a certified
 
01:55:45.510 --> 01:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
position with the Department of
 
01:55:47.830 --> 01:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
Education thank
 
01:55:50.950 --> 01:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
you I actually have a question
 
01:55:54.510 --> 01:55:54.520 align:start position:0%
question certainly children do need to
 
01:55:57.189 --> 01:55:57.199 align:start position:0%
be exposed to a wide variety of
 
01:56:00.669 --> 01:56:00.679 align:start position:0%
experiences and ways of life and all all
 
01:56:03.430 --> 01:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
kinds of different subject
 
01:56:06.589 --> 01:56:06.599 align:start position:0%
matter is there any
 
01:56:09.669 --> 01:56:09.679 align:start position:0%
material in your opinion that would ever
 
01:56:13.229 --> 01:56:13.239 align:start position:0%
need to be removed from a school library
 
01:56:16.149 --> 01:56:16.159 align:start position:0%
because it might be inappropriate for
 
01:56:20.069 --> 01:56:20.079 align:start position:0%
any age any school AG child thank you
 
01:56:22.310 --> 01:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
for the question representative I mean
 
01:56:24.870 --> 01:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
could I imagine that absolutely um but
 
01:56:26.629 --> 01:56:26.639 align:start position:0%
that's not necessarily my decision to
 
01:56:29.470 --> 01:56:29.480 align:start position:0%
make which is why nhba would support a
 
01:56:32.189 --> 01:56:32.199 align:start position:0%
robust um committee if you will made up
 
01:56:34.229 --> 01:56:34.239 align:start position:0%
of parents made up of Educators I've
 
01:56:35.990 --> 01:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
heard of some districts will bring in um
 
01:56:38.229 --> 01:56:38.239 align:start position:0%
a child psychologist or a pediatrician
 
01:56:39.950 --> 01:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it's age appropriate
 
01:56:41.790 --> 01:56:41.800 align:start position:0%
or developmentally appropriate I'm
 
01:56:43.629 --> 01:56:43.639 align:start position:0%
certainly aware of some challenges I
 
01:56:45.510 --> 01:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
think in New Hampshire reaching back
 
01:56:48.270 --> 01:56:48.280 align:start position:0%
anecdotally where a a book was was
 
01:56:49.750 --> 01:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
challenged if you will and maybe a
 
01:56:51.750 --> 01:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
middle school and and they went through
 
01:56:53.030 --> 01:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
the process and they said yeah you know
 
01:56:54.470 --> 01:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
what this probably shouldn't be read by
 
01:56:56.030 --> 01:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
seventh or eighth graders but we'll
 
01:56:57.830 --> 01:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
we'll move it to the high school library
 
01:57:00.189 --> 01:57:00.199 align:start position:0%
so is there is there some material I
 
01:57:03.510 --> 01:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
mean there's you know I mean yeah in the
 
01:57:05.189 --> 01:57:05.199 align:start position:0%
abstract AB absolutely there are some
 
01:57:06.870 --> 01:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
things that should probably not be hand
 
01:57:08.750 --> 01:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
in the hands of kids and you know there
 
01:57:10.390 --> 01:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
are some gross things that I'm sure all
 
01:57:11.950 --> 01:57:11.960 align:start position:0%
of us can't imagine who would ever
 
01:57:14.310 --> 01:57:14.320 align:start position:0%
publish that so I hope that answers your
 
01:57:16.470 --> 01:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
question Madam chair yes I think I have
 
01:57:18.390 --> 01:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
a followup to
 
01:57:22.830 --> 01:57:22.840 align:start position:0%
that we've been shown
 
01:57:22.840 --> 01:57:26.430 align:start position:0%
that we've been shown
material

01:57:26.430 --> 01:57:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:30.629 --> 01:57:30.639 align:start position:0%
that has been I assume it's in schools I
 
01:57:33.270 --> 01:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
have not seen physical proof that these
 
01:57:38.550 --> 01:57:38.560 align:start position:0%
books are in school and when I am shown
 
01:57:41.069 --> 01:57:41.079 align:start position:0%
these books I say I don't want to look
 
01:57:41.079 --> 01:57:43.550 align:start position:0%
these books I say I don't want to look
at

01:57:43.550 --> 01:57:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:47.069 --> 01:57:47.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:50.990 --> 01:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
possible that our culture
 
01:57:53.510 --> 01:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
has gone off the rails a little bit in
 
01:57:56.069 --> 01:57:56.079 align:start position:0%
terms of what we think is appropriate
 
01:57:59.790 --> 01:57:59.800 align:start position:0%
for I mean students thank you for the
 
01:58:01.550 --> 01:58:01.560 align:start position:0%
question Madam chair I'm not in a
 
01:58:04.350 --> 01:58:04.360 align:start position:0%
position to to answer that I I will say
 
01:58:06.149 --> 01:58:06.159 align:start position:0%
you know is there something that is is
 
01:58:07.950 --> 01:58:07.960 align:start position:0%
there material whether it's in schools
 
01:58:09.229 --> 01:58:09.239 align:start position:0%
or not just take that out of the
 
01:58:11.390 --> 01:58:11.400 align:start position:0%
hypothesis for a minute that every one
 
01:58:13.069 --> 01:58:13.079 align:start position:0%
of us would look at and say yeah wow
 
01:58:14.950 --> 01:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
that's disgusting or not appropriate
 
01:58:17.149 --> 01:58:17.159 align:start position:0%
probably but the challenge that we're
 
01:58:19.470 --> 01:58:19.480 align:start position:0%
going to run into which is why we think
 
01:58:22.270 --> 01:58:22.280 align:start position:0%
a robust policy process is is necessary
 
01:58:25.189 --> 01:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
and bringing in multiple views on a on a
 
01:58:28.709 --> 01:58:28.719 align:start position:0%
Review Committee um when do had their
 
01:58:30.390 --> 01:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
their their hearing on a a book that was
 
01:58:32.149 --> 01:58:32.159 align:start position:0%
being challenged maybe three months or
 
01:58:34.629 --> 01:58:34.639 align:start position:0%
so ago there were a couple parents that
 
01:58:36.709 --> 01:58:36.719 align:start position:0%
that spoke in favor of removing that
 
01:58:39.270 --> 01:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
book from the library there were also
 
01:58:41.189 --> 01:58:41.199 align:start position:0%
parents that spoke in favor of keeping
 
01:58:43.950 --> 01:58:43.960 align:start position:0%
the book in the library so you know what
 
01:58:45.470 --> 01:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
what's the school board supposed to do
 
01:58:47.669 --> 01:58:47.679 align:start position:0%
in that scenario they they listen to The
 
01:58:50.589 --> 01:58:50.599 align:start position:0%
Experts and they you know and the do
 
01:58:52.229 --> 01:58:52.239 align:start position:0%
school board chose to keep that in their
 
01:58:53.669 --> 01:58:53.679 align:start position:0%
Library the governor Wentworth School
 
01:58:56.069 --> 01:58:56.079 align:start position:0%
Board may may choose differently thank
 
01:58:57.589 --> 01:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you very much any
 
01:58:59.589 --> 01:58:59.599 align:start position:0%
further questions thank you madam chair
 
01:59:18.229 --> 01:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:18.239 --> 01:59:23.870 align:start position:0%
 
Hampshire

01:59:23.870 --> 01:59:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:26.149 --> 01:59:26.159 align:start position:0%
okay good morning Madam chair good to
 
01:59:28.629 --> 01:59:28.639 align:start position:0%
see you this morning um my name is
 
01:59:30.870 --> 01:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
Deborah H I am here on behalf of
 
01:59:32.229 --> 01:59:32.239 align:start position:0%
American Federation of teachers New
 
01:59:34.950 --> 01:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and our 3700 members across
 
01:59:38.950 --> 01:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
the state and I'm here in support of HB
 
01:59:41.709 --> 01:59:41.719 align:start position:0%
1311 um I'm here because I think this
 
01:59:44.750 --> 01:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
strikes the right balance in recognizing
 
01:59:47.870 --> 01:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
the interest of everyone involved in uh
 
01:59:50.910 --> 01:59:50.920 align:start position:0%
having good policies in place for
 
01:59:52.750 --> 01:59:52.760 align:start position:0%
collection development and for
 
01:59:55.390 --> 01:59:55.400 align:start position:0%
reconsideration procedures for what goes
 
01:59:57.109 --> 01:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
into our school libraries and what stays
 
02:00:00.109 --> 02:00:00.119 align:start position:0%
in our school libraries it recognizes
 
02:00:02.629 --> 02:00:02.639 align:start position:0%
that our local school boards need to
 
02:00:04.790 --> 02:00:04.800 align:start position:0%
have clear policies that everyone
 
02:00:09.109 --> 02:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
understands for these um for these areas
 
02:00:11.589 --> 02:00:11.599 align:start position:0%
it recognizes that there are some
 
02:00:14.270 --> 02:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
parents who may have concerns over
 
02:00:16.350 --> 02:00:16.360 align:start position:0%
whether material that's in the school
 
02:00:18.669 --> 02:00:18.679 align:start position:0%
library belongs there or belongs at a
 
02:00:19.750 --> 02:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
certain age
 
02:00:22.470 --> 02:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
it also recognizes that students do have
 
02:00:24.189 --> 02:00:24.199 align:start position:0%
First Amendment
 
02:00:27.229 --> 02:00:27.239 align:start position:0%
rights um You elucidated by the Supreme
 
02:00:29.229 --> 02:00:29.239 align:start position:0%
Court to access a wide variety of ideas
 
02:00:31.270 --> 02:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
and information through the materials in
 
02:00:33.109 --> 02:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
their school library it's not enough to
 
02:00:34.830 --> 02:00:34.840 align:start position:0%
say well they can have their parents
 
02:00:36.990 --> 02:00:37.000 align:start position:0%
order it on Amazon or they can get from
 
02:00:39.229 --> 02:00:39.239 align:start position:0%
the local library not every family can
 
02:00:41.270 --> 02:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
afford to buy a lot of books not every
 
02:00:42.870 --> 02:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
kid can get to another Library they
 
02:00:44.550 --> 02:00:44.560 align:start position:0%
don't always have transportation the
 
02:00:47.510 --> 02:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
local library may not be open uh hours
 
02:00:50.629 --> 02:00:50.639 align:start position:0%
they can get to so the school library is
 
02:00:52.109 --> 02:00:52.119 align:start position:0%
something they have a right to access
 
02:00:53.870 --> 02:00:53.880 align:start position:0%
and they do have a right to access a
 
02:00:56.870 --> 02:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
wide variety of materials importantly it
 
02:00:59.069 --> 02:00:59.079 align:start position:0%
also keeps any challenged material
 
02:01:01.310 --> 02:01:01.320 align:start position:0%
accessible until the chance process is
 
02:01:03.470 --> 02:01:03.480 align:start position:0%
completed so you can't have Shadow
 
02:01:05.229 --> 02:01:05.239 align:start position:0%
Banning of a law of materials like we
 
02:01:06.830 --> 02:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
have seen in many other states around
 
02:01:09.270 --> 02:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
the country uh it recognizes the
 
02:01:11.310 --> 02:01:11.320 align:start position:0%
responsibility of school libraries to
 
02:01:12.669 --> 02:01:12.679 align:start position:0%
serve the reading and informational
 
02:01:16.510 --> 02:01:16.520 align:start position:0%
needs of all students not every book is
 
02:01:18.830 --> 02:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
right for every student students go
 
02:01:21.350 --> 02:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
there to pursue things they are curious
 
02:01:23.189 --> 02:01:23.199 align:start position:0%
about interested
 
02:01:26.229 --> 02:01:26.239 align:start position:0%
in and not every student has the same
 
02:01:28.430 --> 02:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
interest or are wondering about the same
 
02:01:31.709 --> 02:01:31.719 align:start position:0%
things but School libraries have to try
 
02:01:36.270 --> 02:01:36.280 align:start position:0%
and meet the intellectual
 
02:01:39.910 --> 02:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
curiosity of each student with something
 
02:01:42.350 --> 02:01:42.360 align:start position:0%
in the collection passing this bill
 
02:01:44.589 --> 02:01:44.599 align:start position:0%
keeps the decision making on collection
 
02:01:46.069 --> 02:01:46.079 align:start position:0%
building and how to handle challenge
 
02:01:48.030 --> 02:01:48.040 align:start position:0%
materials at the local level where it
 
02:01:52.270 --> 02:01:52.280 align:start position:0%
belongs local school boards are the
 
02:01:55.510 --> 02:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
closest and most responsive to the local
 
02:01:57.750 --> 02:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
community whether it's appropriate or
 
02:01:59.910 --> 02:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
not is based on local community
 
02:02:03.910 --> 02:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
standards so building that that rich um
 
02:02:06.589 --> 02:02:06.599 align:start position:0%
Committee of individuals to look at any
 
02:02:09.430 --> 02:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
piece of um The Collection that's
 
02:02:12.750 --> 02:02:12.760 align:start position:0%
being questioned you know building that
 
02:02:15.830 --> 02:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
Committee of parents and and School uh
 
02:02:18.030 --> 02:02:18.040 align:start position:0%
personnel and whatever other experts you
 
02:02:19.470 --> 02:02:19.480 align:start position:0%
want to call them whether it's child
 
02:02:21.390 --> 02:02:21.400 align:start position:0%
psychologist all of those people on the
 
02:02:24.430 --> 02:02:24.440 align:start position:0%
committee to review um a challenged
 
02:02:27.229 --> 02:02:27.239 align:start position:0%
material should be done on a local level
 
02:02:29.229 --> 02:02:29.239 align:start position:0%
because that's going to be a different
 
02:02:31.750 --> 02:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
answer perhaps in a small town like
 
02:02:33.149 --> 02:02:33.159 align:start position:0%
permont than it's going to be in the
 
02:02:34.830 --> 02:02:34.840 align:start position:0%
city of Manchester maybe it'll be the
 
02:02:37.270 --> 02:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
same but those opinions could be very
 
02:02:38.709 --> 02:02:38.719 align:start position:0%
different depending upon where you are
 
02:02:40.470 --> 02:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
you don't want someone in this building
 
02:02:42.310 --> 02:02:42.320 align:start position:0%
making that decision for the whole state
 
02:02:43.950 --> 02:02:43.960 align:start position:0%
you don't want someone you know down on
 
02:02:45.229 --> 02:02:45.239 align:start position:0%
Hall Street making that decision for the
 
02:02:47.950 --> 02:02:47.960 align:start position:0%
whole state you want it done on a local
 
02:02:50.310 --> 02:02:50.320 align:start position:0%
level most importantly this bill
 
02:02:52.149 --> 02:02:52.159 align:start position:0%
provides local school boards with
 
02:02:54.109 --> 02:02:54.119 align:start position:0%
important guard rails for their policies
 
02:02:55.310 --> 02:02:55.320 align:start position:0%
that will keep them within the
 
02:02:57.550 --> 02:02:57.560 align:start position:0%
boundaries of what the constitutional
 
02:03:00.390 --> 02:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
rights of students are and what's uh
 
02:03:02.629 --> 02:03:02.639 align:start position:0%
required under New Hampshire law as far
 
02:03:05.229 --> 02:03:05.239 align:start position:0%
as not discriminating against students
 
02:03:07.109 --> 02:03:07.119 align:start position:0%
that's important to remember they do
 
02:03:10.030 --> 02:03:10.040 align:start position:0%
have a right to an equal education we
 
02:03:13.270 --> 02:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
can't carb out groups of students uh and
 
02:03:16.310 --> 02:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
exempt them from having equal
 
02:03:18.189 --> 02:03:18.199 align:start position:0%
access for students to become
 
02:03:19.750 --> 02:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
enthusiastic for readers and LIF
 
02:03:21.550 --> 02:03:21.560 align:start position:0%
Learners they need access to a wide
 
02:03:22.990 --> 02:03:23.000 align:start position:0%
variety of materials through their
 
02:03:24.950 --> 02:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
school libraries they need stories where
 
02:03:26.510 --> 02:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
they can see their own life experience
 
02:03:28.310 --> 02:03:28.320 align:start position:0%
reflected so they don't feel like
 
02:03:30.669 --> 02:03:30.679 align:start position:0%
they're strange broken or alone they
 
02:03:32.669 --> 02:03:32.679 align:start position:0%
also need stories and non-fiction about
 
02:03:34.229 --> 02:03:34.239 align:start position:0%
people in places totally different from
 
02:03:36.109 --> 02:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
their experience so they can follow
 
02:03:38.189 --> 02:03:38.199 align:start position:0%
their curiosity to new countries worlds
 
02:03:41.069 --> 02:03:41.079 align:start position:0%
and universities we want to spark and
 
02:03:44.149 --> 02:03:44.159 align:start position:0%
Inspire them and they need to be able to
 
02:03:46.510 --> 02:03:46.520 align:start position:0%
explore as far as their mind will take
 
02:03:49.350 --> 02:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
them in poll after poll in local C Grant
 
02:03:51.589 --> 02:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
stayers have consist consistently said
 
02:03:53.870 --> 02:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
they support and trust their local
 
02:03:55.510 --> 02:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
neighborhood public schools to educate
 
02:03:58.030 --> 02:03:58.040 align:start position:0%
their students and for these reasons we
 
02:04:01.310 --> 02:04:01.320 align:start position:0%
say you ought to pass HP 1311 keep the
 
02:04:03.310 --> 02:04:03.320 align:start position:0%
decision local and let's have policies
 
02:04:05.470 --> 02:04:05.480 align:start position:0%
everyone can understand and participate
 
02:04:07.109 --> 02:04:07.119 align:start position:0%
in if they have a question thank you
 
02:04:09.069 --> 02:04:09.079 align:start position:0%
very much any
 
02:04:12.350 --> 02:04:12.360 align:start position:0%
questions representative beler thank you
 
02:04:13.510 --> 02:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for your
 
02:04:15.470 --> 02:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
testimony um we've heard in your
 
02:04:17.310 --> 02:04:17.320 align:start position:0%
testimony and others that this is a very
 
02:04:19.310 --> 02:04:19.320 align:start position:0%
important item for local control and
 
02:04:21.629 --> 02:04:21.639 align:start position:0%
make sure that it stays at that
 
02:04:24.030 --> 02:04:24.040 align:start position:0%
level but doesn't this actually do the
 
02:04:26.830 --> 02:04:26.840 align:start position:0%
exact opposite by severely restricting
 
02:04:29.830 --> 02:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
the ability of locals to make decisions
 
02:04:31.870 --> 02:04:31.880 align:start position:0%
on any of the books that fall under any
 
02:04:33.950 --> 02:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
one of these very many very broad
 
02:04:36.390 --> 02:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
categories no it doesn't because they
 
02:04:39.549 --> 02:04:39.559 align:start position:0%
have to have a clear policy that they
 
02:04:42.790 --> 02:04:42.800 align:start position:0%
have passed
 
02:04:45.470 --> 02:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
locally and except for violating
 
02:04:45.480 --> 02:04:47.750 align:start position:0%
locally and except for violating
constitutional

02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:49.950 align:start position:0%
constitutional
protections

02:04:49.950 --> 02:04:49.960 align:start position:0%
protections
 
02:04:53.950 --> 02:04:53.960 align:start position:0%
there is nothing that um crosses local
 
02:04:56.750 --> 02:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
control here so yeah we we're not going
 
02:04:57.950 --> 02:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
to give you permission to violate
 
02:04:57.960 --> 02:04:59.750 align:start position:0%
to give you permission to violate
constitutional

02:04:59.750 --> 02:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
02:05:01.669 --> 02:05:01.679 align:start position:0%
protections I don't think that should be
 
02:05:01.679 --> 02:05:03.189 align:start position:0%
protections I don't think that should be
a

02:05:03.189 --> 02:05:03.199 align:start position:0%

we're talking about constitutional
 
02:05:09.270 --> 02:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
protections and if these things are
 
02:05:11.030 --> 02:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
constitutionally protected then why do
 
02:05:17.669 --> 02:05:17.679 align:start position:0%

02:05:24.950 --> 02:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
across the country where people need a
 
02:05:27.109 --> 02:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
reminder that students do have a right
 
02:05:29.310 --> 02:05:29.320 align:start position:0%
to access a wide variety of materials in
 
02:05:33.189 --> 02:05:33.199 align:start position:0%

or the junior Rozi program which is

taught in some of our schools so I have
 
02:19:34.070 --> 02:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
passed out a sheet for you that I'm
 
02:19:36.030 --> 02:19:36.040 align:start position:0%

this is information from the Razzi
 
02:19:39.910 --> 02:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
program I think would be very good for
 
02:19:42.910 --> 02:19:42.920 align:start position:0%
you to hear and so I will go ahead if
 
02:19:46.429 --> 02:19:46.439 align:start position:0%

assessment which we give in the high
 
02:20:03.070 --> 02:20:03.080 align:start position:0%
school is one way to measure student
 
02:20:06.590 --> 02:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
competency But ultimately the rights and
 
02:20:08.630 --> 02:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of citizens are best
 
02:20:11.110 --> 02:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
demonstrated through applying Civic
 
02:20:13.870 --> 02:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
understandings and being Civic leaders
 
02:20:16.710 --> 02:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
in daily life I brought this bill
 
02:20:18.750 --> 02:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
forward in effort to recognize that
 
02:20:20.750 --> 02:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
student participation in programs such
 
02:20:23.590 --> 02:20:23.600 align:start position:0%

02:20:29.590 --> 02:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
Civ Civic learning a whole step further
 
02:20:32.309 --> 02:20:32.319 align:start position:0%
than simply taking a one-time
 
02:20:34.590 --> 02:20:34.600 align:start position:0%
assessment there are currently close to
 
02:20:40.550 --> 02:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
2,000 Army jrc Junior Ry uh uh programs

02:20:57.349 --> 02:20:57.359 align:start position:0%
about the Army because that's my
 
02:21:02.070 --> 02:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
affiliation Army uh most Jr RC programs
 
02:21:04.670 --> 02:21:04.680 align:start position:0%

citizenship and character development
 
02:21:30.190 --> 02:21:30.200 align:start position:0%

motivate students become better citizens
 
02:21:35.270 --> 02:21:35.280 align:start position:0%

what they pursue upon High School
 
02:21:40.630 --> 02:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
graduation and as a side note when
 
02:21:42.230 --> 02:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
you're in this type of program there's
 
02:21:44.750 --> 02:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
no requirement that you go on into the
 
02:21:46.590 --> 02:21:46.600 align:start position:0%
military it's one where most of the
 
02:21:48.270 --> 02:21:48.280 align:start position:0%
students which are in this do never go
 
02:21:50.150 --> 02:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
into the military they just taking it
 
02:21:52.309 --> 02:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
because they're interested in the Civics
 
02:21:55.429 --> 02:21:55.439 align:start position:0%
and the citizenship that expounds this
 
02:21:58.870 --> 02:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
program is different from senior Razzi
 
02:22:00.510 --> 02:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
their mission is to prepare future
 
02:22:02.070 --> 02:22:02.080 align:start position:0%

02:22:03.630 --> 02:22:03.640 align:start position:0%
here the senior roazzi program is one
 
02:22:05.990 --> 02:22:06.000 align:start position:0%

02:23:44.910 --> 02:23:44.920 align:start position:0%
integrated into the program the program
 
02:23:46.510 --> 02:23:46.520 align:start position:0%

credit the cost to students is
 
02:23:58.309 --> 02:23:58.319 align:start position:0%
approximately $180 per course very
 
02:23:59.550 --> 02:23:59.560 align:start position:0%
similar to our concurrent dual
 
02:24:01.950 --> 02:24:01.960 align:start position:0%
enrollment though local fund Raiders are
 
02:24:04.469 --> 02:24:04.479 align:start position:0%
often able to pay for the courses for
 
02:24:06.309 --> 02:24:06.319 align:start position:0%
those students who complete at least two
 
02:24:09.510 --> 02:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
years of JC and decide to go on to serve
 
02:24:11.830 --> 02:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
in the military they enter at the higher
 
02:24:15.070 --> 02:24:15.080 align:start position:0%
pay grade of e3 and for you for you that
 
02:24:17.349 --> 02:24:17.359 align:start position:0%
are not familiar with it I'm sure are
 
02:24:21.030 --> 02:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
represent Woodcock E1 is you go in as a
 
02:24:24.030 --> 02:24:24.040 align:start position:0%
private E2 as a specialist or a Corporal
 
02:24:26.790 --> 02:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
E3 you come in as a buck Sergeant so
 
02:24:28.990 --> 02:24:29.000 align:start position:0%
they're coming in if they've had the two
 
02:24:31.349 --> 02:24:31.359 align:start position:0%
years of the Razzi program they're able
 
02:24:35.510 --> 02:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
to come in and go the direction of of an
 
02:24:39.630 --> 02:24:39.640 align:start position:0%
NCO and of course there's also the OCS
 
02:24:41.910 --> 02:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
program within the military which they
 
02:24:44.070 --> 02:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
can take advantage
 
02:24:46.950 --> 02:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
of um going on Fall Mountain has class
 
02:24:49.630 --> 02:24:49.640 align:start position:0%
classes Monday through Friday 5 days a
 
02:24:52.309 --> 02:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
week all the roazzi classes support the
 
02:24:54.950 --> 02:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
school's core values the program mission
 
02:24:56.429 --> 02:24:56.439 align:start position:0%
statement is to help young people to
 
02:24:59.070 --> 02:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
become better citizens and emphasize the
 
02:25:01.349 --> 02:25:01.359 align:start position:0%
Civics that strengthens local Community
 
02:25:05.269 --> 02:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
State and nation in regard to the na New
 
02:25:06.990 --> 02:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Civil Air Patrol program which
 
02:25:09.349 --> 02:25:09.359 align:start position:0%
is very similar in many respects the
 
02:25:12.070 --> 02:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
program program is located where I I am
 
02:25:14.750 --> 02:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
at Woodsville High School youth uh in
 
02:25:16.990 --> 02:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
that program are emphasizing the same
 
02:25:19.510 --> 02:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
types of activities Civics leadership
 
02:25:22.230 --> 02:25:22.240 align:start position:0%
Fitness and character and there is a a
 
02:25:24.309 --> 02:25:24.319 align:start position:0%
map Associated you can see where those
 
02:25:27.630 --> 02:25:27.640 align:start position:0%
uh programs are located in our state so
 
02:25:30.429 --> 02:25:30.439 align:start position:0%
I will conclude by saying that the
 
02:25:33.710 --> 02:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
students which come out of these
 
02:25:37.710 --> 02:25:37.720 align:start position:0%
programs have the they're able to apply
 
02:25:40.030 --> 02:25:40.040 align:start position:0%
those Civic skills it through a
 
02:25:41.990 --> 02:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
different way and I I feel for them to
 
02:25:43.309 --> 02:25:43.319 align:start position:0%
have to come back and take this
 
02:25:45.590 --> 02:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
citizenship test after they have done
 
02:25:47.349 --> 02:25:47.359 align:start position:0%
this working in our community doing
 
02:25:50.070 --> 02:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
community service and taking courses
 
02:25:52.630 --> 02:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
within the school through certified
 
02:25:54.510 --> 02:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
instructors um I think they've
 
02:25:56.070 --> 02:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
accomplish that what we're trying to do
 
02:25:57.910 --> 02:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
through some kind of an assessment thank
 
02:26:00.870 --> 02:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
you very much uh thank you uh chairman
 
02:26:04.230 --> 02:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
lad questions represent
 
02:26:06.429 --> 02:26:06.439 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:26:10.110 --> 02:26:10.120 align:start position:0%
for your bill um my question relates to
 
02:26:12.150 --> 02:26:12.160 align:start position:0%
um well put it this way I just finished
 
02:26:13.830 --> 02:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
uh rereading Plato's Republic I don't
 
02:26:15.550 --> 02:26:15.560 align:start position:0%
like Plato very much but he made a good
 
02:26:18.429 --> 02:26:18.439 align:start position:0%
point when he talked about the necessity
 
02:26:20.349 --> 02:26:20.359 align:start position:0%
of those tasks with protecting the
 
02:26:23.030 --> 02:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
Republic to have the highest degree of
 
02:26:25.590 --> 02:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
Civic knowledge and virtue so I'm I'm
 
02:26:26.950 --> 02:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
trying to I guess I'm trying to
 
02:26:28.309 --> 02:26:28.319 align:start position:0%
understand if we think it's a good thing
 
02:26:30.309 --> 02:26:30.319 align:start position:0%
for the average student to be required
 
02:26:32.030 --> 02:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
to take this test so we know they have
 
02:26:34.750 --> 02:26:34.760 align:start position:0%
that knowledge isn't it at least equally
 
02:26:37.150 --> 02:26:37.160 align:start position:0%
important that those in that position of
 
02:26:41.349 --> 02:26:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:44.150 --> 02:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
knowledge there's many ways of assessing
 
02:26:46.030 --> 02:26:46.040 align:start position:0%
knowledge and I think if you look at
 
02:26:47.309 --> 02:26:47.319 align:start position:0%
schools and when we went to the
 
02:26:48.830 --> 02:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
Statewide assessment I can remember a
 
02:26:50.349 --> 02:26:50.359 align:start position:0%
teacher coming before this committee
 
02:26:52.630 --> 02:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
saying a test is not the only way you
 
02:26:54.870 --> 02:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
measure student understanding concept
 
02:26:56.950 --> 02:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
skills and knowledge it's through the
 
02:26:58.870 --> 02:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
application of those and this is a
 
02:27:01.469 --> 02:27:01.479 align:start position:0%
program where we see it we see it living
 
02:27:04.030 --> 02:27:04.040 align:start position:0%
we see the students participating and
 
02:27:07.230 --> 02:27:07.240 align:start position:0%
civically engaged uh understanding the
 
02:27:09.710 --> 02:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
principles of our democracy and
 
02:27:11.750 --> 02:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
respectful of that I think these
 
02:27:13.790 --> 02:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
students deserve that opportunity
 
02:27:15.830 --> 02:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
they're sacrificing already by taking
 
02:27:18.710 --> 02:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
these courses uh I I don't think we have
 
02:27:21.590 --> 02:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
to have a a a duplicate way of assessing
 
02:27:24.710 --> 02:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
whether they've measured up to the those
 
02:27:28.990 --> 02:27:29.000 align:start position:0%
few you know uh questions on the on the
 
02:27:32.070 --> 02:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
citizenship test I'm not I'm not anti
 
02:27:33.670 --> 02:27:33.680 align:start position:0%
that I'm just trying to say at this
 
02:27:36.590 --> 02:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
point in time uh they are getting these
 
02:27:38.429 --> 02:27:38.439 align:start position:0%
uh skills through their program that's
 
02:27:41.469 --> 02:27:41.479 align:start position:0%
being offered in these locations and uh
 
02:27:43.230 --> 02:27:43.240 align:start position:0%
I I think it's
 
02:27:45.670 --> 02:27:45.680 align:start position:0%
duplicative thank you additional
 
02:27:47.190 --> 02:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
represent miler
 
02:27:48.710 --> 02:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:27:50.830 --> 02:27:50.840 align:start position:0%
bringing this before US Representative
 
02:27:53.110 --> 02:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
lad I do have a
 
02:27:55.750 --> 02:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
concern and uh it's the
 
02:27:58.349 --> 02:27:58.359 align:start position:0%
exception I mean you have other Pro this
 
02:27:59.830 --> 02:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
obviously is a very good program no
 
02:28:02.309 --> 02:28:02.319 align:start position:0%
question about that but you also have
 
02:28:04.950 --> 02:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
other programs that are out there I mean
 
02:28:08.870 --> 02:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
you've got the whole um governance a
 
02:28:11.910 --> 02:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
student governance in schools there are
 
02:28:14.750 --> 02:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
student body programs you get elected
 
02:28:16.429 --> 02:28:16.439 align:start position:0%
you're involved in decision making
 
02:28:19.550 --> 02:28:19.560 align:start position:0%
you're basically practicing what we want
 
02:28:21.590 --> 02:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh young people to do as far as
 
02:28:24.670 --> 02:28:24.680 align:start position:0%
governance goes You've Got The Scouting
 
02:28:26.950 --> 02:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
program they're involved in this on an
 
02:28:31.950 --> 02:28:31.960 align:start position:0%
ongoing basis you've got uh some um you
 
02:28:34.550 --> 02:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
got the demolays for example for young
 
02:28:36.429 --> 02:28:36.439 align:start position:0%
men you've got the rainbow girls for
 
02:28:39.269 --> 02:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
girl for girls for young women that are
 
02:28:41.630 --> 02:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
basically dealing with similar kinds of
 
02:28:46.590 --> 02:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
issues as far as uh their citizenship
 
02:28:48.349 --> 02:28:48.359 align:start position:0%
volunteering working in the community
 
02:28:51.230 --> 02:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
Etc my concern is just taking this one
 
02:28:54.950 --> 02:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
program as good as it is and not
 
02:28:57.150 --> 02:28:57.160 align:start position:0%
recognizing other kinds of programs that
 
02:28:59.830 --> 02:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
young people are involved in so I mean
 
02:29:03.309 --> 02:29:03.319 align:start position:0%
where is this a slippery slope the you
 
02:29:04.830 --> 02:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
exempt this one and then we go to
 
02:29:06.910 --> 02:29:06.920 align:start position:0%
another one maybe we should just get rid
 
02:29:08.670 --> 02:29:08.680 align:start position:0%
of the program allog together as far as
 
02:29:11.990 --> 02:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
having to take the test but um that's my
 
02:29:13.750 --> 02:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
concern about this is that you're not
 
02:29:16.710 --> 02:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
recognizing other legitimate programs
 
02:29:19.870 --> 02:29:19.880 align:start position:0%
students are daily practicing the Civics
 
02:29:22.830 --> 02:29:22.840 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about how so where do
 
02:29:25.070 --> 02:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
the other programs fit in to this
 
02:29:27.750 --> 02:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
exception several months ago I attended
 
02:29:30.750 --> 02:29:30.760 align:start position:0%
an award ceremony where we gave the
 
02:29:33.750 --> 02:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
eagle scout award to a student or not a
 
02:29:35.469 --> 02:29:35.479 align:start position:0%
student to an individual that's been in
 
02:29:37.630 --> 02:29:37.640 align:start position:0%
The Scouting program and there are folks
 
02:29:39.790 --> 02:29:39.800 align:start position:0%
there from all the military branches uh
 
02:29:41.429 --> 02:29:41.439 align:start position:0%
and the veterans are also from this
 
02:29:43.469 --> 02:29:43.479 align:start position:0%
state when we're talking about this
 
02:29:45.190 --> 02:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
program right here this is a program
 
02:29:47.469 --> 02:29:47.479 align:start position:0%
that's offered in the School in the
 
02:29:51.349 --> 02:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
school it's a school oriented program uh
 
02:29:54.469 --> 02:29:54.479 align:start position:0%
students get credit for gra going
 
02:29:57.870 --> 02:29:57.880 align:start position:0%
through the rzi program therefore I see
 
02:29:59.790 --> 02:29:59.800 align:start position:0%
the I see all the Merit in what you're
 
02:30:01.870 --> 02:30:01.880 align:start position:0%
saying that all these programs are
 
02:30:03.990 --> 02:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
wonderful programs where we engage
 
02:30:06.190 --> 02:30:06.200 align:start position:0%
students in going Beyond and learning
 
02:30:07.790 --> 02:30:07.800 align:start position:0%
how to volunteer and learning how to
 
02:30:10.950 --> 02:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
work together and practicing the basic
 
02:30:13.630 --> 02:30:13.640 align:start position:0%
principles of the society we live in
 
02:30:14.990 --> 02:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
however this program right here is
 
02:30:17.870 --> 02:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
offered within the conf of the school by
 
02:30:19.910 --> 02:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
instructors that are certified and
 
02:30:22.349 --> 02:30:22.359 align:start position:0%
working in the schools uh Lieutenant
 
02:30:25.030 --> 02:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
Gearhart if you've talked with him up in
 
02:30:27.590 --> 02:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
Whitefield uh that's a program which is
 
02:30:29.550 --> 02:30:29.560 align:start position:0%
well respected in fact parents are
 
02:30:31.190 --> 02:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
asking and wanting their kids to get
 
02:30:32.950 --> 02:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
involved with it seeing it it is a
 
02:30:34.870 --> 02:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
school program offered and there are the
 
02:30:36.429 --> 02:30:36.439 align:start position:0%
parameters which are controlled by the
 
02:30:39.150 --> 02:30:39.160 align:start position:0%
administration in that
 
02:30:42.670 --> 02:30:42.680 align:start position:0%
building represent Tanner thank you and
 
02:30:44.910 --> 02:30:44.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking this um I've talked
 
02:30:49.309 --> 02:30:49.319 align:start position:0%
with a parent of of a y Jr um from Fall
 
02:30:51.269 --> 02:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
Mountain who was just thrilled with the
 
02:30:53.469 --> 02:30:53.479 align:start position:0%
course uh thrilled what it did for her
 
02:30:57.230 --> 02:30:57.240 align:start position:0%
son who's now in the military now but my
 
02:31:00.030 --> 02:31:00.040 align:start position:0%
concern I guess is the same as um
 
02:31:02.510 --> 02:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
representative Myers's you know when we
 
02:31:05.389 --> 02:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
we first talked about the Civics test it
 
02:31:07.510 --> 02:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
was pointed out over and over and over
 
02:31:10.710 --> 02:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
again that a a test that has 100
 
02:31:14.030 --> 02:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
questions on it um that are that are
 
02:31:17.150 --> 02:31:17.160 align:start position:0%
online that are specific really doesn't
 
02:31:20.389 --> 02:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
do what we deep in our hearts I think on
 
02:31:23.389 --> 02:31:23.399 align:start position:0%
this committee want and that is for
 
02:31:25.710 --> 02:31:25.720 align:start position:0%
students to learn what it's like to be
 
02:31:29.670 --> 02:31:29.680 align:start position:0%
an American citizen um and you know we
 
02:31:32.389 --> 02:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
have we now have robust Civics courses
 
02:31:34.630 --> 02:31:34.640 align:start position:0%
in schools in fact karge has been down
 
02:31:36.630 --> 02:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
here several times working with new
 
02:31:40.590 --> 02:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
Futures and um we have the model United
 
02:31:44.590 --> 02:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
Nations uh as well as uh the student um
 
02:31:47.389 --> 02:31:47.399 align:start position:0%
councils and and different uh areas that
 
02:31:49.950 --> 02:31:49.960 align:start position:0%
they have and it's not just community
 
02:31:51.950 --> 02:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
service but they're learning you know
 
02:31:54.469 --> 02:31:54.479 align:start position:0%
how bills are drawn up they they come
 
02:31:56.150 --> 02:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
and watch here the Future Farmers of
 
02:32:00.230 --> 02:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
America the uh we've had them here at
 
02:32:02.750 --> 02:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
the committee they do a robust course on
 
02:32:05.269 --> 02:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
Civics um and even though they're
 
02:32:07.630 --> 02:32:07.640 align:start position:0%
outside the school some schools actually
 
02:32:09.990 --> 02:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
incorporate FFA courses within the
 
02:32:13.030 --> 02:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
school so I guess my concern is the same
 
02:32:17.389 --> 02:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
as representative Myers I I would
 
02:32:20.429 --> 02:32:20.439 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly agree with this and and
 
02:32:22.550 --> 02:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
but at the same time I would use it as a
 
02:32:25.190 --> 02:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
stepping stone to allow other groups
 
02:32:27.110 --> 02:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
that are doing
 
02:32:27.120 --> 02:32:28.630 align:start position:0%
that are doing
Hands-On

02:32:28.630 --> 02:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
Hands-On
 
02:32:32.070 --> 02:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
comprehensive assessment uh to certify
 
02:32:33.670 --> 02:32:33.680 align:start position:0%
people so that they wouldn't have to
 
02:32:36.670 --> 02:32:36.680 align:start position:0%
take this test um would you agree to
 
02:32:40.790 --> 02:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
that I agree that there are many ways to
 
02:32:44.230 --> 02:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
assess students and I've never been an
 
02:32:46.349 --> 02:32:46.359 align:start position:0%
absolute supporter the only way to
 
02:32:48.269 --> 02:32:48.279 align:start position:0%
assess what we're doing in Civics and
 
02:32:51.030 --> 02:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
government is through the citizenship
 
02:32:53.990 --> 02:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
exam one of which we anytime we do
 
02:32:56.309 --> 02:32:56.319 align:start position:0%
assess we need to have a a bank of
 
02:32:58.550 --> 02:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
questions which rotates so that we don't
 
02:32:59.990 --> 02:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
have the same questions asked the
 
02:33:02.389 --> 02:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
students over and over and over uh I
 
02:33:03.910 --> 02:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
went to an experience like that when I
 
02:33:05.830 --> 02:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
took anthropology in college I thought I
 
02:33:07.550 --> 02:33:07.560 align:start position:0%
had all the answers to the test and said
 
02:33:08.870 --> 02:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
I don't have to buy the textbook I don't
 
02:33:10.190 --> 02:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
have to do anything we got it down the
 
02:33:12.349 --> 02:33:12.359 align:start position:0%
attorney house was the first year that
 
02:33:14.309 --> 02:33:14.319 align:start position:0%
the professor ever changed the
 
02:33:17.269 --> 02:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
test and and so and my wife sitting
 
02:33:19.030 --> 02:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
beside me then my girlfriend at that
 
02:33:23.670 --> 02:33:23.680 align:start position:0%
time said I gotcha and so um I I I think
 
02:33:26.630 --> 02:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
there's um a lot of thought that was
 
02:33:28.590 --> 02:33:28.600 align:start position:0%
it's going into our Civics programs
 
02:33:30.510 --> 02:33:30.520 align:start position:0%
right now we have a task force looking
 
02:33:35.830 --> 02:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
at that I'm not absolutely confirmed or
 
02:33:39.389 --> 02:33:39.399 align:start position:0%
are sold that the citizen test we give
 
02:33:42.990 --> 02:33:43.000 align:start position:0%
right now is an accurate accurate way to
 
02:33:45.510 --> 02:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
assess what we're doing in Civics
 
02:33:45.520 --> 02:33:46.830 align:start position:0%
assess what we're doing in Civics
education

02:33:46.830 --> 02:33:46.840 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:33:48.590 --> 02:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
is it aligned with our academic
 
02:33:50.550 --> 02:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
standards is it aligned with what we do
 
02:33:52.349 --> 02:33:52.359 align:start position:0%
in government is it aligned with what we
 
02:33:55.030 --> 02:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
do in history uh I've never been shown
 
02:33:57.429 --> 02:33:57.439 align:start position:0%
that it does uh but it is one of the
 
02:33:59.230 --> 02:33:59.240 align:start position:0%
tools which we use it's used widely
 
02:34:01.030 --> 02:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
throughout the country in many school
 
02:34:03.790 --> 02:34:03.800 align:start position:0%
districts and States um I'm not
 
02:34:06.389 --> 02:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
objecting to that however I think that
 
02:34:08.030 --> 02:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
if we think that's going to be the end
 
02:34:10.150 --> 02:34:10.160 align:start position:0%
all and we've got the solution to what
 
02:34:13.950 --> 02:34:13.960 align:start position:0%
we're doing I I think we would be in a
 
02:34:16.230 --> 02:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
false neighborhood we have to really
 
02:34:18.030 --> 02:34:18.040 align:start position:0%
realize there's many different ways and
 
02:34:20.550 --> 02:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
this particular situation right here
 
02:34:21.950 --> 02:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about an
 
02:34:24.510 --> 02:34:24.520 align:start position:0%
extracurricular activity such as FFA
 
02:34:27.670 --> 02:34:27.680 align:start position:0%
I've worked with the FFA 4 and all that
 
02:34:31.710 --> 02:34:31.720 align:start position:0%
um this program is done in school by the
 
02:34:35.750 --> 02:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
school and and approved by the school
 
02:34:38.590 --> 02:34:38.600 align:start position:0%
board so there is a difference here than
 
02:34:40.389 --> 02:34:40.399 align:start position:0%
some of the other extracurricular which
 
02:34:42.309 --> 02:34:42.319 align:start position:0%
we're talking about we don't give credit
 
02:34:44.469 --> 02:34:44.479 align:start position:0%
for extracurricular activities but we do
 
02:34:46.550 --> 02:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
give credit for those activities taught
 
02:34:49.030 --> 02:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
in the classroom in the schools or those
 
02:34:50.349 --> 02:34:50.359 align:start position:0%
alternative programs which have been
 
02:34:53.070 --> 02:34:53.080 align:start position:0%
approved by Administration in the school
 
02:34:55.349 --> 02:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
so I agree partially what you're saying
 
02:34:56.990 --> 02:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
but I also believe that this is a little
 
02:34:58.550 --> 02:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
bit different than some of the other
 
02:35:01.070 --> 02:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
areas we've been we've been talking
 
02:35:04.429 --> 02:35:04.439 align:start position:0%
about quickly please just that with the
 
02:35:07.269 --> 02:35:07.279 align:start position:0%
learn everywhere program and uh Extended
 
02:35:09.110 --> 02:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
Learning opportunities we do give credit
 
02:35:11.230 --> 02:35:11.240 align:start position:0%
for those things now in the
 
02:35:14.990 --> 02:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
schools was that a followup Yeah
 
02:35:18.469 --> 02:35:18.479 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
02:35:20.469 --> 02:35:20.479 align:start position:0%
Hall thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:35:22.710 --> 02:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
for taking my question when I first saw
 
02:35:24.269 --> 02:35:24.279 align:start position:0%
this I guess I was wondering all right I
 
02:35:26.790 --> 02:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
guess I'll ask the question um is there
 
02:35:28.429 --> 02:35:28.439 align:start position:0%
do we think even though we agree I think
 
02:35:30.510 --> 02:35:30.520 align:start position:0%
we both agree on alternative assessments
 
02:35:32.309 --> 02:35:32.319 align:start position:0%
that the kids that are in this program
 
02:35:34.110 --> 02:35:34.120 align:start position:0%
would pass the test and this is just a
 
02:35:35.670 --> 02:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
waste of their time to make them sit
 
02:35:38.510 --> 02:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
through the test or maybe they might not
 
02:35:40.110 --> 02:35:40.120 align:start position:0%
pass the test even though they've gone
 
02:35:41.670 --> 02:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
through this
 
02:35:44.950 --> 02:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
experience one once again I'll respond
 
02:35:44.960 --> 02:35:47.070 align:start position:0%
experience one once again I'll respond
that

02:35:47.070 --> 02:35:47.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:35:49.230 --> 02:35:49.240 align:start position:0%
what is the true
 
02:35:53.710 --> 02:35:53.720 align:start position:0%
purpose of giving this citizenship test
 
02:35:55.950 --> 02:35:55.960 align:start position:0%
the immigration test which we give is it
 
02:35:58.389 --> 02:35:58.399 align:start position:0%
to measure what we're teaching in the
 
02:36:01.110 --> 02:36:01.120 align:start position:0%
schools if it is how many different ways
 
02:36:03.190 --> 02:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
are there to measure I've heard many
 
02:36:04.870 --> 02:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
ways from the committee in the past and
 
02:36:07.590 --> 02:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
those testifying from teachers from
 
02:36:10.110 --> 02:36:10.120 align:start position:0%
those parents that there's different
 
02:36:13.110 --> 02:36:13.120 align:start position:0%
ways to measure some students are not
 
02:36:15.269 --> 02:36:15.279 align:start position:0%
very good test takers when it comes to
 
02:36:16.670 --> 02:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
paper pencil
 
02:36:18.309 --> 02:36:18.319 align:start position:0%
but when you see them actually
 
02:36:20.710 --> 02:36:20.720 align:start position:0%
performing and able to accomplish what
 
02:36:24.309 --> 02:36:24.319 align:start position:0%
you try to you taught you see a
 
02:36:27.230 --> 02:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
different part of the equation so I I
 
02:36:28.670 --> 02:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
think we need to be a little bit more
 
02:36:31.030 --> 02:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
open in terms of looking at how we
 
02:36:35.870 --> 02:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
assess and what ways we can we can uh
 
02:36:37.630 --> 02:36:37.640 align:start position:0%
understand that the student has mastered
 
02:36:39.990 --> 02:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
these skills and today in today's
 
02:36:42.990 --> 02:36:43.000 align:start position:0%
society we have a lot of things we think
 
02:36:44.429 --> 02:36:44.439 align:start position:0%
we're teaching at school but then you
 
02:36:46.030 --> 02:36:46.040 align:start position:0%
start seeing some of the reactions and
 
02:36:47.630 --> 02:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
occurrence which is occurring out there
 
02:36:49.950 --> 02:36:49.960 align:start position:0%
in society today you see wow they really
 
02:36:51.469 --> 02:36:51.479 align:start position:0%
didn't get
 
02:36:54.750 --> 02:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
it and so this is this there's proof in
 
02:36:56.349 --> 02:36:56.359 align:start position:0%
the pudding in this program right here
 
02:36:59.830 --> 02:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
we see these kids doing what we want
 
02:37:01.830 --> 02:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
through through the the the goals and
 
02:37:03.190 --> 02:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
objectives and outcomes through our
 
02:37:06.070 --> 02:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
Civics program so it's a it's a another
 
02:37:08.750 --> 02:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
way that we we should be looking at in
 
02:37:11.429 --> 02:37:11.439 align:start position:0%
terms of how we assess within our
 
02:37:15.030 --> 02:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
schools um I'm not sold on that one test
 
02:37:17.910 --> 02:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
is 120 questions we've got the answer
 
02:37:19.429 --> 02:37:19.439 align:start position:0%
right there and that doesn't do it for
 
02:37:22.750 --> 02:37:22.760 align:start position:0%
me I'm sorry represent
 
02:37:24.870 --> 02:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair thanks for
 
02:37:25.790 --> 02:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
02:37:28.830 --> 02:37:28.840 align:start position:0%
question I'm wondering what data there
 
02:37:32.550 --> 02:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
might be on how many students complete
 
02:37:35.230 --> 02:37:35.240 align:start position:0%
the full I believe you said it was four
 
02:37:37.590 --> 02:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
years Junior rzi
 
02:37:40.550 --> 02:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
program and parallel to that if a
 
02:37:44.910 --> 02:37:44.920 align:start position:0%
student is able to enroll only for a
 
02:37:46.830 --> 02:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
much more finite per period of time it
 
02:37:47.830 --> 02:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
would appear in the bill they would
 
02:37:50.630 --> 02:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
still qualify to be exempt from the
 
02:37:55.469 --> 02:37:55.479 align:start position:0%
exam the the uh program is a course or
 
02:37:58.030 --> 02:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
courses so you get credit in a course
 
02:37:59.510 --> 02:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
you don't have to be in it for four
 
02:38:02.070 --> 02:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
years you can be in for two years if
 
02:38:03.870 --> 02:38:03.880 align:start position:0%
you're like if you're in there two years
 
02:38:05.590 --> 02:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
then you have you can have the option if
 
02:38:07.710 --> 02:38:07.720 align:start position:0%
you go in the military to go in at a
 
02:38:10.230 --> 02:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
higher rank which is a real savings and
 
02:38:12.990 --> 02:38:13.000 align:start position:0%
and I went in my first pay for month and
 
02:38:15.030 --> 02:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
when I went in as private e nothing was
 
02:38:17.910 --> 02:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
$69 a month of course I got cigarettes
 
02:38:20.710 --> 02:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
in the side and and everything else but
 
02:38:23.870 --> 02:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
that was in that which I don't smoke but
 
02:38:27.670 --> 02:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
um it's it's a significant increase in
 
02:38:30.550 --> 02:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
pay and you know so then I had to
 
02:38:32.550 --> 02:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
realize whoop I had a college degree
 
02:38:35.230 --> 02:38:35.240 align:start position:0%
what am I doing as E1 after a year and a
 
02:38:37.710 --> 02:38:37.720 align:start position:0%
half I went to OCS and became an officer
 
02:38:40.830 --> 02:38:40.840 align:start position:0%
and and and and on so but this this
 
02:38:42.349 --> 02:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
program right here is not you don't have
 
02:38:44.070 --> 02:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
to be in at just four you can four four
 
02:38:45.469 --> 02:38:45.479 align:start position:0%
years you can be in two years you can be
 
02:38:47.590 --> 02:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
in for one
 
02:38:49.910 --> 02:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
semester represent
 
02:38:53.830 --> 02:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you chairman um afternoon
 
02:38:57.510 --> 02:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
or almost afternoon any know I I I Rick
 
02:38:59.230 --> 02:38:59.240 align:start position:0%
I totally concur with you in terms of
 
02:39:00.630 --> 02:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
the value of these two programs without
 
02:39:06.309 --> 02:39:06.319 align:start position:0%
a question um but I want to ask uh if uh
 
02:39:08.990 --> 02:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm talking specifically because of
 
02:39:13.269 --> 02:39:13.279 align:start position:0%
kenet Ken has a similar program uh with
 
02:39:15.750 --> 02:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
youngsters in it and they're every day
 
02:39:17.110 --> 02:39:17.120 align:start position:0%
taking a class they do stuff on
 
02:39:18.990 --> 02:39:19.000 align:start position:0%
Saturdays they have uniform they do pt
 
02:39:21.110 --> 02:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
they do the whole thing uh and they do
 
02:39:23.550 --> 02:39:23.560 align:start position:0%
their uh you know their civic engagement
 
02:39:25.710 --> 02:39:25.720 align:start position:0%
without a question uh and community
 
02:39:28.429 --> 02:39:28.439 align:start position:0%
activities so I'm wondering but it
 
02:39:30.710 --> 02:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't it's not one of these two
 
02:39:32.990 --> 02:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
programs it's a similar program so I'm
 
02:39:34.830 --> 02:39:34.840 align:start position:0%
wondering and and represent Miler
 
02:39:36.950 --> 02:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
brought some of the other like School
 
02:39:40.950 --> 02:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
similar programs would you be open to uh
 
02:39:43.309 --> 02:39:43.319 align:start position:0%
an amendment that on this bill that adds
 
02:39:47.269 --> 02:39:47.279 align:start position:0%
or similar programs I I think that I
 
02:39:50.150 --> 02:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
would be on the condition that there's
 
02:39:53.030 --> 02:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
specific criteria that's put down for
 
02:39:55.230 --> 02:39:55.240 align:start position:0%
example the the program for the junior
 
02:39:57.550 --> 02:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
roazzi program is approved by the board
 
02:39:59.950 --> 02:39:59.960 align:start position:0%
there is a syllabus there is a program
 
02:40:02.269 --> 02:40:02.279 align:start position:0%
developed I want to see that for these
 
02:40:05.110 --> 02:40:05.120 align:start position:0%
other programs as well I think that
 
02:40:08.630 --> 02:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
that's an absolute um if you have a
 
02:40:11.710 --> 02:40:11.720 align:start position:0%
program which just is emerging and in
 
02:40:13.990 --> 02:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
and it's may be sanctioned by the
 
02:40:16.950 --> 02:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
particular school but as with any
 
02:40:18.389 --> 02:40:18.399 align:start position:0%
program which you're going to get degree
 
02:40:19.990 --> 02:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
credit those credit that has to be
 
02:40:21.830 --> 02:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
approved through your school board
 
02:40:23.710 --> 02:40:23.720 align:start position:0%
correct so I'd like to see that route
 
02:40:25.389 --> 02:40:25.399 align:start position:0%
take and if some another program could
 
02:40:27.750 --> 02:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
come up and do that I'm all for it thank
 
02:40:29.870 --> 02:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
you thank you chair see no further
 
02:40:31.190 --> 02:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much oh I'm
 
02:40:33.590 --> 02:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
sorry representative Cornell Thank you
 
02:40:35.510 --> 02:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
and it this isn't really a question but
 
02:40:37.670 --> 02:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
Manchester High School West is the naval
 
02:40:40.950 --> 02:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
Roc just so I just want to throw that in
 
02:40:43.870 --> 02:40:43.880 align:start position:0%
and seeing kids go into it I I actually
 
02:40:45.710 --> 02:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
do think it's it's wonderful but they
 
02:40:47.469 --> 02:40:47.479 align:start position:0%
wear their un it is a commitment they
 
02:40:49.590 --> 02:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
wear their uniforms to school at least
 
02:40:52.910 --> 02:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
one day a week um they accompany I
 
02:40:55.950 --> 02:40:55.960 align:start position:0%
forget I just went blank with the flags
 
02:40:55.960 --> 02:40:56.990 align:start position:0%
forget I just went blank with the flags
their

02:40:56.990 --> 02:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:41:00.269 --> 02:41:00.279 align:start position:0%
um what color the color guard you know
 
02:41:02.510 --> 02:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
even when I was at the the middle school
 
02:41:04.750 --> 02:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
we would request them to come and open
 
02:41:06.790 --> 02:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
things for us with the color guard so it
 
02:41:08.950 --> 02:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
is a commitment so I just it's a total
 
02:41:10.790 --> 02:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
commitment I'm sorry you have a Navy
 
02:41:12.710 --> 02:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
program rather than an army program you
 
02:41:14.830 --> 02:41:14.840 align:start position:0%
know Navy got beaten last football game
 
02:41:17.830 --> 02:41:17.840 align:start position:0%

sitting before you at this time is one
 
02:41:53.030 --> 02:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
of those students you're talking about I
 
02:41:55.990 --> 02:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
was the Battalion commander of a
 
02:41:59.510 --> 02:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
battalion of army rooc students my
 
02:42:03.870 --> 02:42:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:06.990 --> 02:42:07.000 align:start position:0%
school every week we held a
 
02:42:10.070 --> 02:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
parade and I stood there and this is the
 
02:42:11.870 --> 02:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
part you're not hearing from the
 
02:42:16.790 --> 02:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
association next to my female compat rot
 
02:42:19.389 --> 02:42:19.399 align:start position:0%
who was called a sponsor who held the
 
02:42:21.190 --> 02:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
same rank I
 
02:42:26.429 --> 02:42:26.439 align:start position:0%
did and we initiated a formal Battalion
 
02:42:26.439 --> 02:42:28.790 align:start position:0%
did and we initiated a formal Battalion
review

02:42:28.790 --> 02:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
review
 
02:42:31.190 --> 02:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
parade every
 
02:42:35.070 --> 02:42:35.080 align:start position:0%
week in between that week we attended
 
02:42:38.750 --> 02:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
classes we studied literary history of
 
02:42:42.389 --> 02:42:42.399 align:start position:0%
the military we studied the military
 
02:42:45.710 --> 02:42:45.720 align:start position:0%
history along with the government and in
 
02:42:47.830 --> 02:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
the summer if we chose we could go to
 
02:42:52.389 --> 02:42:52.399 align:start position:0%
summer camp where I learned to use my
 
02:42:55.150 --> 02:42:55.160 align:start position:0%
minimal athletic skills in clambering
 
02:42:58.150 --> 02:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
over various obstacles without much
 
02:43:01.510 --> 02:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
grace I must admit but I got
 
02:43:04.710 --> 02:43:04.720 align:start position:0%
over that's what I learned the important
 
02:43:06.670 --> 02:43:06.680 align:start position:0%
thing is to get
 
02:43:10.309 --> 02:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
over to accomplish the mission you set
 
02:43:11.750 --> 02:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
out to
 
02:43:14.269 --> 02:43:14.279 align:start position:0%
accomplish at whatever
 
02:43:17.429 --> 02:43:17.439 align:start position:0%
cost that's a lesson you don't learn in
 
02:43:20.550 --> 02:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
civics class how can I say that because
 
02:43:22.389 --> 02:43:22.399 align:start position:0%
I took
 
02:43:22.399 --> 02:43:24.670 align:start position:0%
I took
Civics

02:43:24.670 --> 02:43:24.680 align:start position:0%
Civics
 
02:43:27.309 --> 02:43:27.319 align:start position:0%
also and I took
 
02:43:32.429 --> 02:43:32.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:35.670 --> 02:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
math I took the Navy
 
02:43:38.389 --> 02:43:38.399 align:start position:0%
Roc scholarship
 
02:43:42.230 --> 02:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:48.150 --> 02:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:51.750 --> 02:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I get out of jail free card all I
 
02:43:54.469 --> 02:43:54.479 align:start position:0%
had to do was not be drafted I just had
 
02:43:55.830 --> 02:43:55.840 align:start position:0%

02:43:58.070 --> 02:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
polio and what did I
 
02:44:00.630 --> 02:44:00.640 align:start position:0%
do I kept my mouth
 
02:44:03.469 --> 02:44:03.479 align:start position:0%
shut I went off to college and took my
 
02:44:06.150 --> 02:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
scholarship and passed my
 
02:44:10.110 --> 02:44:10.120 align:start position:0%

02:44:21.750 --> 02:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
stuff the ship I was on had previously
 
02:44:24.150 --> 02:44:24.160 align:start position:0%

02:44:31.230 --> 02:44:31.240 align:start position:0%
hook on a little cable and that goes
 
02:44:33.510 --> 02:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
across and they are arrested and they
 
02:44:35.349 --> 02:44:35.359 align:start position:0%

02:46:42.710 --> 02:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
Alicia leus Hillsboro 38 and I'm here to
 
02:46:47.349 --> 02:46:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:52.510 --> 02:46:52.520 align:start position:0%
um for a number of years now our state
 
02:46:56.870 --> 02:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
education system by law has been based
 
02:46:56.880 --> 02:46:58.349 align:start position:0%
education system by law has been based
on

02:46:58.349 --> 02:46:58.359 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:47:00.309 --> 02:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
competencies but
 
02:47:03.150 --> 02:47:03.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunately by practice we haven't
 
02:47:06.550 --> 02:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
seen that as much and I asked numerous
 
02:47:08.790 --> 02:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
times why
 
02:47:13.710 --> 02:47:13.720 align:start position:0%
are kids wasting time taking
 
02:47:17.830 --> 02:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:20.990 --> 02:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
are not at the level they're at whether
 
02:47:23.670 --> 02:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
they are bored because they know it all
 
02:47:25.389 --> 02:47:25.399 align:start position:0%
or whether they are totally confused
 
02:47:28.230 --> 02:47:28.240 align:start position:0%
because they're not there yet why are we
 
02:47:31.870 --> 02:47:31.880 align:start position:0%
having them spend a year sitting in a
 
02:47:34.070 --> 02:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
class that is inappropriate for them
 
02:47:36.389 --> 02:47:36.399 align:start position:0%
when we're Competency Based and we
 
02:47:38.870 --> 02:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
should be placing them in classes based
 
02:47:41.750 --> 02:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
on their competency in that area and so
 
02:47:43.590 --> 02:47:43.600 align:start position:0%
I've been asking that question and all
 
02:47:45.630 --> 02:47:45.640 align:start position:0%
I've gotten is well well that's the law
 
02:47:47.389 --> 02:47:47.399 align:start position:0%
the law is that we can do that we
 
02:47:49.750 --> 02:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
already took care of that we passed a
 
02:47:55.190 --> 02:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
law and it through a lot of questioning
 
02:47:56.910 --> 02:47:56.920 align:start position:0%
and trying to figure out well if that's
 
02:47:59.710 --> 02:47:59.720 align:start position:0%
the law why aren't we doing it what I
 
02:48:02.269 --> 02:48:02.279 align:start position:0%
have pretty much discovered is we're
 
02:48:04.870 --> 02:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
doing it we're not doing it because most
 
02:48:09.070 --> 02:48:09.080 align:start position:0%
people don't know and so every school is
 
02:48:11.830 --> 02:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
required to have an
 
02:48:14.269 --> 02:48:14.279 align:start position:0%
exam that's part of that Competency
 
02:48:15.389 --> 02:48:15.399 align:start position:0%
Based law
 
02:48:17.670 --> 02:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
that every student is every school is
 
02:48:19.230 --> 02:48:19.240 align:start position:0%
required to have an exam for all of
 
02:48:21.510 --> 02:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
their tasks all of their classes I'm
 
02:48:21.520 --> 02:48:23.309 align:start position:0%
their tasks all of their classes I'm
sorry

02:48:23.309 --> 02:48:23.319 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:48:26.710 --> 02:48:26.720 align:start position:0%
um that a kid can take right and that's
 
02:48:28.990 --> 02:48:29.000 align:start position:0%
also part of the law but the thing is
 
02:48:31.110 --> 02:48:31.120 align:start position:0%
nobody knows well not nobody but an
 
02:48:33.389 --> 02:48:33.399 align:start position:0%
awful lot of people don't know and so
 
02:48:35.790 --> 02:48:35.800 align:start position:0%
all this is doing is saying let's make
 
02:48:39.110 --> 02:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
sure everybody knows and so it just says
 
02:48:41.269 --> 02:48:41.279 align:start position:0%
that the schools need to put in their
 
02:48:44.830 --> 02:48:44.840 align:start position:0%
student handbook whatever those uh
 
02:48:47.590 --> 02:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
procedures are which by law they have to
 
02:48:51.389 --> 02:48:51.399 align:start position:0%
have so to be generous we'll assume that
 
02:48:53.590 --> 02:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
all schools have those have already done
 
02:48:55.110 --> 02:48:55.120 align:start position:0%
all of those all they have to do is
 
02:48:57.230 --> 02:48:57.240 align:start position:0%
publish it in their student handbook and
 
02:49:00.830 --> 02:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
that way a kid can sit and go oh I've
 
02:49:03.830 --> 02:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
learned all this stuff already I can
 
02:49:05.950 --> 02:49:05.960 align:start position:0%
take the test and go on to the next
 
02:49:08.950 --> 02:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
level of this course which makes better
 
02:49:12.110 --> 02:49:12.120 align:start position:0%
use of my limited time in school I mean
 
02:49:14.790 --> 02:49:14.800 align:start position:0%
you only have four years in high school
 
02:49:17.070 --> 02:49:17.080 align:start position:0%
and if you're taking you're forced to
 
02:49:18.790 --> 02:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
take the lower level classes you may
 
02:49:20.990 --> 02:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
never get to the higher level classes in
 
02:49:23.190 --> 02:49:23.200 align:start position:0%
that four years but if you already know
 
02:49:25.990 --> 02:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
the material you take the exam you move
 
02:49:27.830 --> 02:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
to the next level and that way in your
 
02:49:29.590 --> 02:49:29.600 align:start position:0%
four years you can get all the way up to
 
02:49:31.790 --> 02:49:31.800 align:start position:0%
calculus or whatever it is that you're
 
02:49:34.309 --> 02:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
trying to get to and so this just lets
 
02:49:36.510 --> 02:49:36.520 align:start position:0%
the students and the parents know this
 
02:49:39.150 --> 02:49:39.160 align:start position:0%
is the procedure so if you think you
 
02:49:41.190 --> 02:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
belong in a different class you can take
 
02:49:44.030 --> 02:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
the test and that'll help determine
 
02:49:47.150 --> 02:49:47.160 align:start position:0%
which class you really should be in
 
02:49:49.910 --> 02:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
that's what this is about thank you very
 
02:49:51.309 --> 02:49:51.319 align:start position:0%
much there questions from the committee
 
02:49:53.710 --> 02:49:53.720 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher thank you Mr
 
02:49:56.110 --> 02:49:56.120 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you rep leus uh I
 
02:49:57.670 --> 02:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
generally think that the principle
 
02:49:58.910 --> 02:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
behind this is okay but I have a
 
02:50:01.269 --> 02:50:01.279 align:start position:0%
question about the language on so here
 
02:50:05.229 --> 02:50:05.239 align:start position:0%
it says uh under Article Five here it
 
02:50:08.110 --> 02:50:08.120 align:start position:0%
says a student is placed in a course
 
02:50:10.870 --> 02:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
based on achievement of the compet
 
02:50:14.710 --> 02:50:14.720 align:start position:0%
competencies contained within the course
 
02:50:16.070 --> 02:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
shouldn't that actually be a reference
 
02:50:18.630 --> 02:50:18.640 align:start position:0%
to the competencies of the prerequisites
 
02:50:30.269 --> 02:50:30.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:30.279 --> 02:50:33.469 align:start position:0%
 
itself

02:50:33.469 --> 02:50:33.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:37.429 --> 02:50:37.439 align:start position:0%
um I would I I can see that either way
 
02:50:39.550 --> 02:50:39.560 align:start position:0%
if they're based based on the
 
02:50:42.710 --> 02:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
competencies it means have they already
 
02:50:44.790 --> 02:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
completed those competencies and if they
 
02:50:47.469 --> 02:50:47.479 align:start position:0%
have not then they should be in that
 
02:50:50.910 --> 02:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
course as opposed to the next course
 
02:50:52.429 --> 02:50:52.439 align:start position:0%
which if they have completed the
 
02:50:52.439 --> 02:50:54.030 align:start position:0%
which if they have completed the
competencies

02:50:54.030 --> 02:50:54.040 align:start position:0%
competencies
 
02:50:57.710 --> 02:50:57.720 align:start position:0%
so I can see that work wording working
 
02:50:57.720 --> 02:51:00.510 align:start position:0%
so I can see that work wording working
either

02:51:00.510 --> 02:51:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:03.830 --> 02:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
way uh I I have a question for you uh
 
02:51:07.309 --> 02:51:07.319 align:start position:0%
within Ed 306 schools are required to
 
02:51:09.510 --> 02:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
have at least 43
 
02:51:12.070 --> 02:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
courses and competency associated with
 
02:51:14.229 --> 02:51:14.239 align:start position:0%
those but you're also talking of primary
 
02:51:14.239 --> 02:51:16.030 align:start position:0%
those but you're also talking of primary
grades

02:51:16.030 --> 02:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
grades
 
02:51:18.950 --> 02:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
and primary grades K through if it's
 
02:51:20.910 --> 02:51:20.920 align:start position:0%
going up through
 
02:51:25.190 --> 02:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
the the actually Elementary could be K8
 
02:51:28.630 --> 02:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
or middle school four through um I'm I'm
 
02:51:28.640 --> 02:51:30.070 align:start position:0%
or middle school four through um I'm I'm
concerned

02:51:30.070 --> 02:51:30.080 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
02:51:32.229 --> 02:51:32.239 align:start position:0%
that that they're going to have to have
 
02:51:33.750 --> 02:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
in this
 
02:51:33.760 --> 02:51:36.349 align:start position:0%
in this
handbook

02:51:36.349 --> 02:51:36.359 align:start position:0%
handbook
 
02:51:40.510 --> 02:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
um information regarding the course so
 
02:51:42.429 --> 02:51:42.439 align:start position:0%
now what are we going to put in there
 
02:51:44.269 --> 02:51:44.279 align:start position:0%
for kindergarten or first grade what
 
02:51:50.269 --> 02:51:50.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:52.830 --> 02:51:52.840 align:start position:0%
about it might be math and the
 
02:51:54.950 --> 02:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
competencies that have to be recover
 
02:51:57.229 --> 02:51:57.239 align:start position:0%
covered in math in the first grade and
 
02:51:59.870 --> 02:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
you may have a kid who's
 
02:52:03.030 --> 02:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
already maybe they have older siblings
 
02:52:04.990 --> 02:52:05.000 align:start position:0%
and they talk about all of this and
 
02:52:07.070 --> 02:52:07.080 align:start position:0%
they're at that point or Beyond and they
 
02:52:09.670 --> 02:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
really should be when the school when
 
02:52:13.750 --> 02:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
their class is doing third grade be with
 
02:52:15.190 --> 02:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
the third grade
 
02:52:16.910 --> 02:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
you know Swap and then come back and the
 
02:52:18.670 --> 02:52:18.680 align:start position:0%
same thing with reading you may have
 
02:52:22.710 --> 02:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
kids who are very good readers and can
 
02:52:25.229 --> 02:52:25.239 align:start position:0%
um during that time period That's
 
02:52:28.030 --> 02:52:28.040 align:start position:0%
focused on reading or math not the time
 
02:52:29.990 --> 02:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
periods that you're also including
 
02:52:32.349 --> 02:52:32.359 align:start position:0%
reading in your history and all that
 
02:52:35.030 --> 02:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
other stuff but that which is focused on
 
02:52:38.950 --> 02:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
actually teaching reading skills they
 
02:52:43.229 --> 02:52:43.239 align:start position:0%
might be moving to a different classroom
 
02:52:48.429 --> 02:52:48.439 align:start position:0%
for that and I think if um I think
 
02:52:49.750 --> 02:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things that we're
 
02:52:51.830 --> 02:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
missing particularly in the elementary
 
02:52:55.550 --> 02:52:55.560 align:start position:0%
schools is being able to move kids based
 
02:52:57.990 --> 02:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
on their competency in a subject because
 
02:52:59.469 --> 02:52:59.479 align:start position:0%
you may have a kid who's an excellent
 
02:53:01.830 --> 02:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
reader and doesn't no math at all so
 
02:53:05.110 --> 02:53:05.120 align:start position:0%
just putting them in first grade may not
 
02:53:08.389 --> 02:53:08.399 align:start position:0%
be best effect the best for them and
 
02:53:10.990 --> 02:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
their learning it may be better to have
 
02:53:14.429 --> 02:53:14.439 align:start position:0%
them go to a second or third grade class
 
02:53:17.190 --> 02:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
in their reading and maybe that third
 
02:53:19.510 --> 02:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
grader who still doesn't get how reading
 
02:53:21.990 --> 02:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
works coming to their room during that
 
02:53:24.070 --> 02:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
instructional period but then the
 
02:53:26.950 --> 02:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
opposite for math so this gives kids it
 
02:53:29.070 --> 02:53:29.080 align:start position:0%
gives it more of an ability for kids to
 
02:53:32.389 --> 02:53:32.399 align:start position:0%
be taught where they're at thank you
 
02:53:34.389 --> 02:53:34.399 align:start position:0%
further questions representative uh
 
02:53:36.389 --> 02:53:36.399 align:start position:0%
Cornell then represent thank you thank
 
02:53:38.150 --> 02:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
you for taking the question so you would
 
02:53:40.469 --> 02:53:40.479 align:start position:0%
assume that every class in the building
 
02:53:43.630 --> 02:53:43.640 align:start position:0%
is teaching math at the same time no but
 
02:53:47.870 --> 02:53:47.880 align:start position:0%
I I know that that I don't assume that
 
02:53:50.830 --> 02:53:50.840 align:start position:0%
but I do assume that people are flexible
 
02:53:52.510 --> 02:53:52.520 align:start position:0%
and that they can figure something out
 
02:53:54.950 --> 02:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
and the reason that is I I went to a
 
02:53:58.229 --> 02:53:58.239 align:start position:0%
small Elementary School and yet in my
 
02:54:00.910 --> 02:54:00.920 align:start position:0%
school the teachers talked to each other
 
02:54:04.469 --> 02:54:04.479 align:start position:0%
and they were able to say okay I have
 
02:54:06.950 --> 02:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
this student or I have this student
 
02:54:09.590 --> 02:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
let's get together and figure out how we
 
02:54:11.670 --> 02:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
can do this and they did and that was
 
02:54:13.190 --> 02:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
more than one different School District
 
02:54:14.510 --> 02:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
cuz we had moved partway through through
 
02:54:17.110 --> 02:54:17.120 align:start position:0%
and in each School District we had that
 
02:54:19.950 --> 02:54:19.960 align:start position:0%
very thing and not only that we had
 
02:54:21.469 --> 02:54:21.479 align:start position:0%
teachers who were more comfortable
 
02:54:24.030 --> 02:54:24.040 align:start position:0%
teaching particular topics and they
 
02:54:25.750 --> 02:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
actually even
 
02:54:28.870 --> 02:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
though fifth grade say everybody is in
 
02:54:30.469 --> 02:54:30.479 align:start position:0%
fifth grade with has one
 
02:54:33.110 --> 02:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
teacher my fifth grade teachers one was
 
02:54:34.910 --> 02:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
good at teaching English and one was
 
02:54:36.590 --> 02:54:36.600 align:start position:0%
good at teaching science and they
 
02:54:39.429 --> 02:54:39.439 align:start position:0%
arranged between the two of them to
 
02:54:43.190 --> 02:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
teach English and science back to back
 
02:54:45.349 --> 02:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
so that they could swamp
 
02:54:48.269 --> 02:54:48.279 align:start position:0%
who taught that subject and so I believe
 
02:54:53.150 --> 02:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
it can be done follow up yes and I don't
 
02:54:55.590 --> 02:54:55.600 align:start position:0%
see a timeline on this so if halfway
 
02:54:57.229 --> 02:54:57.239 align:start position:0%
through the school year they take the
 
02:54:59.790 --> 02:54:59.800 align:start position:0%
assessment they would move to the next
 
02:55:03.469 --> 02:55:03.479 align:start position:0%
so in high school if they do all the
 
02:55:05.469 --> 02:55:05.479 align:start position:0%
algebra they need to do and it's halfway
 
02:55:07.710 --> 02:55:07.720 align:start position:0%
through the year they would move on to
 
02:55:09.550 --> 02:55:09.560 align:start position:0%
the next math class and they would have
 
02:55:12.950 --> 02:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
missed the whole first half of the class
 
02:55:14.590 --> 02:55:14.600 align:start position:0%
in that case they would have have to
 
02:55:17.349 --> 02:55:17.359 align:start position:0%
take the competency for that first half
 
02:55:19.710 --> 02:55:19.720 align:start position:0%
because a lot of the schools work by
 
02:55:22.950 --> 02:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
semesters and you have a semester final
 
02:55:25.670 --> 02:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
and so you could you would have to take
 
02:55:28.469 --> 02:55:28.479 align:start position:0%
that not just the semester final for the
 
02:55:30.790 --> 02:55:30.800 align:start position:0%
algebra but say if the next thing is
 
02:55:34.389 --> 02:55:34.399 align:start position:0%
geometry you'd have to take that final
 
02:55:37.110 --> 02:55:37.120 align:start position:0%
for that first semester in order to move
 
02:55:38.990 --> 02:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
to the other to show that you know that
 
02:55:40.190 --> 02:55:40.200 align:start position:0%
material and you're not going to be
 
02:55:43.150 --> 02:55:43.160 align:start position:0%
missing it well but if they pass the
 
02:55:45.150 --> 02:55:45.160 align:start position:0%
algebra one and they don't pass the
 
02:55:47.070 --> 02:55:47.080 align:start position:0%
geometry one where do they go to class
 
02:55:48.950 --> 02:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately they're going to be stuck
 
02:55:51.510 --> 02:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
in algebra one thank you I mean you can
 
02:55:53.510 --> 02:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
only do so
 
02:55:55.389 --> 02:55:55.399 align:start position:0%
much further questions from the
 
02:55:59.190 --> 02:55:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:03.590 --> 02:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
you good morning question on um the
 
02:56:06.110 --> 02:56:06.120 align:start position:0%
comcy leas
 
02:56:09.590 --> 02:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
if before I go into a second class I've
 
02:56:13.269 --> 02:56:13.279 align:start position:0%
come in I've come to the um graduate
 
02:56:15.590 --> 02:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
from grade 8 promoted from grade8 to
 
02:56:17.790 --> 02:56:17.800 align:start position:0%
grade n in high school uh and I think
 
02:56:20.309 --> 02:56:20.319 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty sharp in English and
 
02:56:22.229 --> 02:56:22.239 align:start position:0%
literature The Freshman Basics whatever
 
02:56:23.389 --> 02:56:23.399 align:start position:0%
they happen to be could be Grandma
 
02:56:26.950 --> 02:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
whatever they teach um so I take the
 
02:56:29.389 --> 02:56:29.399 align:start position:0%
competency class for competency for that
 
02:56:30.990 --> 02:56:31.000 align:start position:0%
grade nine class whatever the sequence
 
02:56:34.269 --> 02:56:34.279 align:start position:0%
happens to be and I pass it now does
 
02:56:36.590 --> 02:56:36.600 align:start position:0%
that mean I'm opting out of the grade
 
02:56:38.670 --> 02:56:38.680 align:start position:0%
nine does that mean I get credit for the
 
02:56:40.710 --> 02:56:40.720 align:start position:0%
class I've never taken or am I just
 
02:56:42.510 --> 02:56:42.520 align:start position:0%
waving that class requirement and moving
 
02:56:45.030 --> 02:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
into grade 10 English you're w that c
 
02:56:46.710 --> 02:56:46.720 align:start position:0%
requirement and moving
 
02:56:49.750 --> 02:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
into grade 10 English so I don't I won't
 
02:56:52.670 --> 02:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
be okay that's fine just so I won't be
 
02:56:54.710 --> 02:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
receiving credit for grade nine English
 
02:56:57.429 --> 02:56:57.439 align:start position:0%
I just basically popped waved out of it
 
02:56:59.349 --> 02:56:59.359 align:start position:0%
into a high low okay thank you thank you
 
02:57:01.590 --> 02:57:01.600 align:start position:0%
chairman L yes represent
 
02:57:03.550 --> 02:57:03.560 align:start position:0%
Hall thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:57:05.550 --> 02:57:05.560 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so I'm curious if
 
02:57:07.790 --> 02:57:07.800 align:start position:0%
a school district wrote in their in
 
02:57:10.269 --> 02:57:10.279 align:start position:0%
their handbook we support differentiated
 
02:57:12.830 --> 02:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
instruction they off the
 
02:57:16.190 --> 02:57:16.200 align:start position:0%
hook well because if by law they have to
 
02:57:20.750 --> 02:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
have a method for determining competency
 
02:57:24.110 --> 02:57:24.120 align:start position:0%
so I don't see how that does that I
 
02:57:26.030 --> 02:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
don't see how that makes them off the
 
02:57:28.389 --> 02:57:28.399 align:start position:0%
hook by just saying we support this it's
 
02:57:32.670 --> 02:57:32.680 align:start position:0%
not giving the um method which they have
 
02:57:34.630 --> 02:57:34.640 align:start position:0%
to have by
 
02:57:39.110 --> 02:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
law follow up yes so if I have a fifth
 
02:57:41.150 --> 02:57:41.160 align:start position:0%
grade math class and I have a student in
 
02:57:42.389 --> 02:57:42.399 align:start position:0%
there is really at the eighth grade
 
02:57:44.830 --> 02:57:44.840 align:start position:0%
level but he's in my class
 
02:57:46.710 --> 02:57:46.720 align:start position:0%
different differentiate instruction
 
02:57:49.309 --> 02:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
tells me as a teacher I need to be
 
02:57:51.710 --> 02:57:51.720 align:start position:0%
teaching him at the e8th grade level
 
02:57:54.269 --> 02:57:54.279 align:start position:0%
well in that case you would you would
 
02:57:57.469 --> 02:57:57.479 align:start position:0%
have to in the student handbook explain
 
02:58:00.389 --> 02:58:00.399 align:start position:0%
that's what I mean the method for not
 
02:58:01.910 --> 02:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
just if you say well we have
 
02:58:03.670 --> 02:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
differentiated instruction that doesn't
 
02:58:06.349 --> 02:58:06.359 align:start position:0%
tell anybody how that has to be done and
 
02:58:09.429 --> 02:58:09.439 align:start position:0%
so the handbook like I said I'm not
 
02:58:12.150 --> 02:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
changing what a school has or has to do
 
02:58:14.389 --> 02:58:14.399 align:start position:0%
that's already in law I'm saying saying
 
02:58:17.990 --> 02:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
what is the method for it to be done so
 
02:58:20.870 --> 02:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
if I was the fifth grader or you were
 
02:58:22.830 --> 02:58:22.840 align:start position:0%
the teacher of the fifth grader and you
 
02:58:24.630 --> 02:58:24.640 align:start position:0%
think they should have eighth grade you
 
02:58:27.510 --> 02:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
both need to know how that happens and
 
02:58:30.429 --> 02:58:30.439 align:start position:0%
so that's what I'm asking for what is
 
02:58:33.190 --> 02:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
what is the method how does that happen
 
02:58:34.630 --> 02:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
what do you as the teacher what do you
 
02:58:36.190 --> 02:58:36.200 align:start position:0%
as the student
 
02:58:39.030 --> 02:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
do to be in the eighth grade class as
 
02:58:41.070 --> 02:58:41.080 align:start position:0%
opposed to the fifth grade
 
02:58:43.510 --> 02:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
class I'll talk to you later for the
 
02:58:46.070 --> 02:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
question but I do can I can I go back
 
02:58:48.389 --> 02:58:48.399 align:start position:0%
and respond again because no I'd like to
 
02:58:50.950 --> 02:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
have questions coming to you I meant the
 
02:58:53.070 --> 02:58:53.080 align:start position:0%
question that she asked but we're we're
 
02:58:55.790 --> 02:58:55.800 align:start position:0%
on to other people right now and so
 
02:58:58.110 --> 02:58:58.120 align:start position:0%
further questions represent
 
02:59:00.750 --> 02:59:00.760 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you um I take a little
 
02:59:03.550 --> 02:59:03.560 align:start position:0%
umbrage to uh wasting time in a
 
02:59:06.150 --> 02:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
classroom and I'm just wondering if you
 
02:59:10.110 --> 02:59:10.120 align:start position:0%
if you have any idea of what else might
 
02:59:12.190 --> 02:59:12.200 align:start position:0%
be going on in classroom that couldn't
 
02:59:15.750 --> 02:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
be tested out
 
02:59:18.870 --> 02:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that a portion of my
 
02:59:23.269 --> 02:59:23.279 align:start position:0%
ninth grade class wasted time an entire
 
02:59:26.670 --> 02:59:26.680 align:start position:0%
year in math and therefore didn't get to
 
02:59:28.670 --> 02:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
take all the math classes that we had
 
02:59:31.429 --> 02:59:31.439 align:start position:0%
wanted to take because we were sitting
 
02:59:34.429 --> 02:59:34.439 align:start position:0%
through a class we already had taken but
 
02:59:38.469 --> 02:59:38.479 align:start position:0%
didn't have credit for and we spent time
 
02:59:40.630 --> 02:59:40.640 align:start position:0%
either doing homework or passing notes
 
02:59:43.469 --> 02:59:43.479 align:start position:0%
or whatever and the teacher said as long
 
02:59:45.269 --> 02:59:45.279 align:start position:0%
as your quiet and you don't disturb
 
02:59:47.030 --> 02:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
anybody else and you can continue to get
 
02:59:51.550 --> 02:59:51.560 align:start position:0%
A's on the tests I don't care I did
 
02:59:53.790 --> 02:59:53.800 align:start position:0%
myself and two of the other students did
 
02:59:55.750 --> 02:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
manage to get that changed for students
 
02:59:59.710 --> 02:59:59.720 align:start position:0%
coming up behind but yes if you're if
 
03:00:01.030 --> 03:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
03:00:04.309 --> 03:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
material in effect you are wasting that
 
03:00:06.229 --> 03:00:06.239 align:start position:0%
chunk of time that could be spent
 
03:00:08.670 --> 03:00:08.680 align:start position:0%
learning new things and that's what I'm
 
03:00:10.590 --> 03:00:10.600 align:start position:0%
referring to you have a limited number
 
03:00:10.600 --> 03:00:12.590 align:start position:0%
referring to you have a limited number
of

03:00:12.590 --> 03:00:12.600 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:00:15.990 --> 03:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
years that you are in school and so to
 
03:00:18.670 --> 03:00:18.680 align:start position:0%
sit through a class that's teaching
 
03:00:20.630 --> 03:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
material that you already know when you
 
03:00:22.630 --> 03:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
could be learning new
 
03:00:25.830 --> 03:00:25.840 align:start position:0%
material and therefore get more out of
 
03:00:29.190 --> 03:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
your education I'm not saying don't take
 
03:00:31.950 --> 03:00:31.960 align:start position:0%
any classes I'm saying move on to the
 
03:00:34.150 --> 03:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
next so you get as much knowledge as you
 
03:00:36.429 --> 03:00:36.439 align:start position:0%
can in the time that you're in
 
03:00:38.990 --> 03:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
school other questions from the
 
03:00:42.429 --> 03:00:42.439 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very
 
03:00:45.950 --> 03:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
much uh we have one other card no we
 
03:00:45.960 --> 03:00:47.550 align:start position:0%
much uh we have one other card no we
don't

03:00:47.550 --> 03:00:47.560 align:start position:0%
don't
 
03:00:51.670 --> 03:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
no any other car people from the public
 
03:00:52.990 --> 03:00:53.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much with that we're
 
03:00:55.150 --> 03:00:55.160 align:start position:0%
going to close this hearing
 
03:01:02.950 --> 03:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:08.870 --> 03:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:42.630 --> 03:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:42.640 --> 03:39:09.229 align:start position:0%
 
e

03:39:09.229 --> 03:39:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:09.239 --> 03:40:39.110 align:start position:0%

e

04:11:16.030 --> 04:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:20.109 --> 04:11:20.119 align:start position:0%
uh thank you yeah thank you very much uh
 
04:11:23.389 --> 04:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
we'll start afternoon session um with
 
04:11:24.910 --> 04:11:24.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
04:11:28.309 --> 04:11:28.319 align:start position:0%
1476 relative Charter to Charter School
 
04:11:31.429 --> 04:11:31.439 align:start position:0%
memorandums of understanding and uh
 
04:11:34.109 --> 04:11:34.119 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell will introduce
 
04:11:37.030 --> 04:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
it thank you representative Patricia
 
04:11:37.040 --> 04:11:37.870 align:start position:0%
it thank you representative Patricia
Cornell

04:11:37.870 --> 04:11:37.880 align:start position:0%
Cornell
 
04:11:42.870 --> 04:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
District 22 Manchester's w 11 this is
 
04:11:45.429 --> 04:11:45.439 align:start position:0%
1476 relative to Charter School
 
04:11:47.950 --> 04:11:47.960 align:start position:0%
memorandums of understanding and
 
04:11:50.269 --> 04:11:50.279 align:start position:0%
basically the only thing that this bill
 
04:11:53.309 --> 04:11:53.319 align:start position:0%
does is change the dates of when the
 
04:11:56.109 --> 04:11:56.119 align:start position:0%
memor memorandum of understanding will
 
04:11:58.469 --> 04:11:58.479 align:start position:0%
go into effect and change it prior to
 
04:12:01.870 --> 04:12:01.880 align:start position:0%
the school till November 1st um the
 
04:12:05.349 --> 04:12:05.359 align:start position:0%
reason for that is many Charters and
 
04:12:07.550 --> 04:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
public schools don't have staff work
 
04:12:09.750 --> 04:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
during the summer that would be working
 
04:12:14.550 --> 04:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
on the IEP so it it puts everyone behind
 
04:12:16.389 --> 04:12:16.399 align:start position:0%
to have to have it ready for the first
 
04:12:19.030 --> 04:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
day of school and it also provides more
 
04:12:24.750 --> 04:12:24.760 align:start position:0%
time to develop the um memorandums of in
 
04:12:29.030 --> 04:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
of understanding in a meaningful way so
 
04:12:29.040 --> 04:12:29.950 align:start position:0%
of understanding in a meaningful way so
that's

04:12:29.950 --> 04:12:29.960 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:12:34.030 --> 04:12:34.040 align:start position:0%
it thank you for um your concise
 
04:12:36.990 --> 04:12:37.000 align:start position:0%
presentation um any questions from the
 
04:12:37.000 --> 04:12:39.670 align:start position:0%
presentation um any questions from the
Comm

04:12:39.670 --> 04:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:42.550 --> 04:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
04:12:45.590 --> 04:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
you uh are there any other cards for
 
04:12:45.600 --> 04:12:51.149 align:start position:0%
you uh are there any other cards for
this

04:12:51.149 --> 04:12:51.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:55.070 --> 04:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
bill this 1467
 
04:12:58.109 --> 04:12:58.119 align:start position:0%
yeah that's 37
 
04:13:00.990 --> 04:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
okay uh I don't is there anyone else who
 
04:13:04.429 --> 04:13:04.439 align:start position:0%
wanted to testify on this
 
04:13:07.790 --> 04:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
Bill yes thank you
 
04:13:12.469 --> 04:13:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:14.550 --> 04:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
card uh good afternoon Melissa white
 
04:13:16.030 --> 04:13:16.040 align:start position:0%
division director for learner Support
 
04:13:17.590 --> 04:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
04:13:20.670 --> 04:13:20.680 align:start position:0%
Education um with the fiscal note we
 
04:13:23.309 --> 04:13:23.319 align:start position:0%
included um some information just re
 
04:13:24.910 --> 04:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
some concerns with regards to this
 
04:13:27.710 --> 04:13:27.720 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation um students that
 
04:13:29.229 --> 04:13:29.239 align:start position:0%
are coming into the school year that
 
04:13:31.990 --> 04:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
have an IEP that's already in effect
 
04:13:34.349 --> 04:13:34.359 align:start position:0%
would then it's possible they would not
 
04:13:36.830 --> 04:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
have Services provided until November
 
04:13:39.910 --> 04:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
1st if we change that date so there is
 
04:13:43.750 --> 04:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
some concerns around that in
 
04:13:46.189 --> 04:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
addition waiting until November 1st to
 
04:13:48.910 --> 04:13:48.920 align:start position:0%
get those Services lined up for those
 
04:13:50.790 --> 04:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
students for example if you needed to
 
04:13:53.349 --> 04:13:53.359 align:start position:0%
provide some sort of speech therapist or
 
04:13:56.269 --> 04:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
some sort of services that were not
 
04:13:58.710 --> 04:13:58.720 align:start position:0%
available that should be arranged prior
 
04:14:02.109 --> 04:14:02.119 align:start position:0%
to the start of the school year and not
 
04:14:03.469 --> 04:14:03.479 align:start position:0%
a few months after the school year
 
04:14:05.070 --> 04:14:05.080 align:start position:0%
started so there's just some concerns
 
04:14:06.550 --> 04:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
with some of the services for those
 
04:14:06.560 --> 04:14:07.670 align:start position:0%
with some of the services for those
students

04:14:07.670 --> 04:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
students
 
04:14:09.750 --> 04:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
if we wait until that November 1st in
 
04:14:13.389 --> 04:14:13.399 align:start position:0%
addition School budgets are determined
 
04:14:16.269 --> 04:14:16.279 align:start position:0%
the year prior SO waiting to make all of
 
04:14:18.109 --> 04:14:18.119 align:start position:0%
those decisions after the school year
 
04:14:19.830 --> 04:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
started could potentially have a
 
04:14:22.149 --> 04:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
negative impact on those districts
 
04:14:25.030 --> 04:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
trying to negotiate and pay for those
 
04:14:28.229 --> 04:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
services so just some potential um
 
04:14:30.189 --> 04:14:30.199 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences that we wanted
 
04:14:33.189 --> 04:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:36.790 --> 04:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
forward thank you very much uh any
 
04:14:39.590 --> 04:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
question questions for Miss
 
04:14:44.189 --> 04:14:44.199 align:start position:0%
White um yes represent Damon thank you
 
04:14:45.630 --> 04:14:45.640 align:start position:0%
Mr chair took a minute trying to figure
 
04:14:48.550 --> 04:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
out how to ask this question sure thank
 
04:14:52.389 --> 04:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
you so I don't think I understand the
 
04:14:55.070 --> 04:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
different impact you noted potential
 
04:14:57.790 --> 04:14:57.800 align:start position:0%
impact on school budgets from September
 
04:14:59.870 --> 04:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
1st versus November 1st when the budgets
 
04:15:01.750 --> 04:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
are crafted the year
 
04:15:03.870 --> 04:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
before so they should be arranging for
 
04:15:06.269 --> 04:15:06.279 align:start position:0%
those Services prior to the start of the
 
04:15:08.670 --> 04:15:08.680 align:start position:0%
school year so if they have Theus
 
04:15:10.349 --> 04:15:10.359 align:start position:0%
established prior to the school year
 
04:15:12.269 --> 04:15:12.279 align:start position:0%
beginning that would have already been
 
04:15:13.910 --> 04:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
accounted for as opposed to after the
 
04:15:15.469 --> 04:15:15.479 align:start position:0%
school year
 
04:15:17.830 --> 04:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
starts so there was just some concern
 
04:15:20.429 --> 04:15:20.439 align:start position:0%
that um we wanted there could be some
 
04:15:22.070 --> 04:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
potential issues we just wanted to
 
04:15:22.080 --> 04:15:23.710 align:start position:0%
potential issues we just wanted to
mention

04:15:23.710 --> 04:15:23.720 align:start position:0%
mention
 
04:15:23.720 --> 04:15:25.990 align:start position:0%
mention
that

04:15:25.990 --> 04:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:15:29.550 --> 04:15:29.560 align:start position:0%
sure but budgets are established in
 
04:15:33.389 --> 04:15:33.399 align:start position:0%
March or May so I'm still confused May
 
04:15:35.109 --> 04:15:35.119 align:start position:0%
so looking at some of those students
 
04:15:37.790 --> 04:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
they may want to even be considered ing
 
04:15:44.469 --> 04:15:44.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:46.910 --> 04:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
year yes
 
04:15:46.920 --> 04:15:49.149 align:start position:0%
year yes
oh

04:15:49.149 --> 04:15:49.159 align:start position:0%
oh
 
04:15:52.710 --> 04:15:52.720 align:start position:0%
sorry Lakers I know it's hard isn't
 
04:15:52.720 --> 04:15:54.670 align:start position:0%
sorry Lakers I know it's hard isn't
it

04:15:54.670 --> 04:15:54.680 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:15:57.389 --> 04:15:57.399 align:start position:0%
um is there a
 
04:16:00.710 --> 04:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
reason why these things can't be figured
 
04:16:02.389 --> 04:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
out before the
 
04:16:05.550 --> 04:16:05.560 align:start position:0%
end before everybody goes away for the
 
04:16:09.109 --> 04:16:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:10.750 --> 04:16:10.760 align:start position:0%
that would be a good recommendation to
 
04:16:12.030 --> 04:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
figure it out before the end of the
 
04:16:13.269 --> 04:16:13.279 align:start position:0%
school year especially if you already
 
04:16:14.630 --> 04:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
know your students I mean you might have
 
04:16:15.870 --> 04:16:15.880 align:start position:0%
students that are coming in at the
 
04:16:17.269 --> 04:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
beginning of the school year that you
 
04:16:19.070 --> 04:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
may not have anticipated coming into the
 
04:16:20.870 --> 04:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
charter school but if you have those
 
04:16:22.590 --> 04:16:22.600 align:start position:0%
students that you know are from this
 
04:16:24.030 --> 04:16:24.040 align:start position:0%
District but are going to this Charter
 
04:16:26.309 --> 04:16:26.319 align:start position:0%
School yes it would make sense
 
04:16:29.229 --> 04:16:29.239 align:start position:0%
to you could speak a little closer and
 
04:16:32.670 --> 04:16:32.680 align:start position:0%
that goes all board members had issues
 
04:16:35.389 --> 04:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
with people hearing us so you know if we
 
04:16:38.109 --> 04:16:38.119 align:start position:0%
all speak closer the mic mhone will be
 
04:16:41.750 --> 04:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
I'll use my teacher voice there you go
 
04:16:43.990 --> 04:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
so yes it would make sense for to make
 
04:16:46.550 --> 04:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
those arrangements prior to even you
 
04:16:48.349 --> 04:16:48.359 align:start position:0%
know ending the school year but there
 
04:16:50.309 --> 04:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
was just the concern with the start of
 
04:16:52.670 --> 04:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
November 1st particularly that could
 
04:16:54.469 --> 04:16:54.479 align:start position:0%
have some unintended consequences we
 
04:16:57.710 --> 04:16:57.720 align:start position:0%
just want to be aware of thank
 
04:17:00.630 --> 04:17:00.640 align:start position:0%
you further
 
04:17:02.990 --> 04:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
questions I seeing none thank you very
 
04:17:05.790 --> 04:17:05.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:05.800 --> 04:17:07.349 align:start position:0%
 
here

04:17:07.349 --> 04:17:07.359 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:17:09.189 --> 04:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
was there anyone else who wanted to
 
04:17:14.229 --> 04:17:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:35.790 --> 04:17:35.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:35.800 --> 04:33:18.029 align:start position:0%
 
it

04:33:18.029 --> 04:33:18.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:20.910 --> 04:33:20.920 align:start position:0%
okay we're uh on to our next bill for
 
04:33:25.230 --> 04:33:25.240 align:start position:0%
the afternoon which is hb1 1437 relative
 
04:33:27.670 --> 04:33:27.680 align:start position:0%
to the membership of the State Board of
 
04:33:30.789 --> 04:33:30.799 align:start position:0%
Education and the prime sponsor is ready
 
04:33:33.949 --> 04:33:33.959 align:start position:0%
U represent Tanner thank you Mr chair
 
04:33:35.869 --> 04:33:35.879 align:start position:0%
and thank you honorable committee
 
04:33:38.189 --> 04:33:38.199 align:start position:0%
members um for the record my name is
 
04:33:40.470 --> 04:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
Linda Tanner I represent Sullivan
 
04:33:42.510 --> 04:33:42.520 align:start position:0%
District 5 which is the beautiful towns
 
04:33:44.590 --> 04:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
of Springfield and
 
04:33:48.109 --> 04:33:48.119 align:start position:0%
sopy um I've given you two handouts that
 
04:33:50.029 --> 04:33:50.039 align:start position:0%
have kind of come around and I thought
 
04:33:52.310 --> 04:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
might add some important background
 
04:33:54.590 --> 04:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
information one is the history of a New
 
04:33:56.150 --> 04:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Board of Education that was
 
04:33:57.310 --> 04:33:57.320 align:start position:0%
created in
 
04:34:02.269 --> 04:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
1919 and 1919 was a world shaking year
 
04:34:04.310 --> 04:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
uh America was recovering from World War
 
04:34:05.869 --> 04:34:05.879 align:start position:0%
I and
 
04:34:07.869 --> 04:34:07.879 align:start position:0%
were setting off bombs labor unions Were
 
04:34:10.629 --> 04:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
Striking in shipyards even the women's
 
04:34:13.150 --> 04:34:13.160 align:start position:0%
telephone operators went out on strike
 
04:34:15.869 --> 04:34:15.879 align:start position:0%
and the 18th Amendment um authorizing
 
04:34:17.510 --> 04:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
prohibition as well as the 19th
 
04:34:19.949 --> 04:34:19.959 align:start position:0%
Amendment giving women suffrage were
 
04:34:23.551 --> 04:34:23.561 align:start position:0%
passed um so it was a pretty pretty
 
04:34:25.510 --> 04:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
hectic year but probably the worst thing
 
04:34:27.830 --> 04:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
that happened was that b Babe Ruth was
 
04:34:30.629 --> 04:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
sold by the Boston Red Sox to the New
 
04:34:32.150 --> 04:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
York Yankees for
 
04:34:34.269 --> 04:34:34.279 align:start position:0%
$125,000 will the will the member
 
04:34:34.279 --> 04:34:37.750 align:start position:0%
$125,000 will the will the member
suspend

04:34:37.750 --> 04:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:40.470 --> 04:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
and thus began the 84 years of the curse
 
04:34:43.590 --> 04:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
of the Bambino that was solved in 2004
 
04:34:46.109 --> 04:34:46.119 align:start position:0%
needless to say it was a turbulent time
 
04:34:48.189 --> 04:34:48.199 align:start position:0%
um but it was also the time that New
 
04:34:51.269 --> 04:34:51.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire realized that to cherish
 
04:34:54.551 --> 04:34:54.561 align:start position:0%
education as our constitution prescribes
 
04:34:57.150 --> 04:34:57.160 align:start position:0%
needed some drastic changes to reach the
 
04:34:59.349 --> 04:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
many citizens who could not read it
 
04:35:01.590 --> 04:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
right at that time um particularly in
 
04:35:04.629 --> 04:35:04.639 align:start position:0%
the rural areas the the major um
 
04:35:06.869 --> 04:35:06.879 align:start position:0%
Industrial areas of Claremont Manchester
 
04:35:09.510 --> 04:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
NASA and the Sea Coast were really going
 
04:35:11.990 --> 04:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh pretty well and their schools were
 
04:35:13.709 --> 04:35:13.719 align:start position:0%
doing very well but out in the
 
04:35:16.551 --> 04:35:16.561 align:start position:0%
hinterland it wasn't quite as good uh
 
04:35:19.310 --> 04:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
the governor at that time Bartlett um
 
04:35:21.949 --> 04:35:21.959 align:start position:0%
and the Le John Bartlett and the
 
04:35:25.310 --> 04:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
legislators um legislature created a
 
04:35:27.990 --> 04:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
commission or of Education position in
 
04:35:30.709 --> 04:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education was formed
 
04:35:34.310 --> 04:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
um so it's over a 100 years old the
 
04:35:36.709 --> 04:35:36.719 align:start position:0%
balance was stated by having politically
 
04:35:39.109 --> 04:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
spirited and interested citizens on a
 
04:35:42.750 --> 04:35:42.760 align:start position:0%
Board of Trustees type uh board that was
 
04:35:45.869 --> 04:35:45.879 align:start position:0%
complemented with a um quoted skilled
 
04:35:47.869 --> 04:35:47.879 align:start position:0%
executive officer who had training and
 
04:35:50.709 --> 04:35:50.719 align:start position:0%
experience in educational work the hand
 
04:35:52.910 --> 04:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
on on History gives you a unique view of
 
04:35:54.709 --> 04:35:54.719 align:start position:0%
the thoughts and debates recorded that
 
04:35:58.029 --> 04:35:58.039 align:start position:0%
year uh many concerns and duties remain
 
04:36:01.029 --> 04:36:01.039 align:start position:0%
to this day of the of the State Board of
 
04:36:03.429 --> 04:36:03.439 align:start position:0%
Education the establishment of the board
 
04:36:05.310 --> 04:36:05.320 align:start position:0%
stated that no more than three members
 
04:36:07.869 --> 04:36:07.879 align:start position:0%
out of their five could be of one party
 
04:36:09.510 --> 04:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
and that no technical educator or
 
04:36:11.230 --> 04:36:11.240 align:start position:0%
persons professionally engaged in
 
04:36:13.910 --> 04:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
schoolwork could serve so they were
 
04:36:17.310 --> 04:36:17.320 align:start position:0%
trying to make it um very
 
04:36:19.470 --> 04:36:19.480 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan the state school board was
 
04:36:21.670 --> 04:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
changed several times over the last 100
 
04:36:23.910 --> 04:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
years eliminating regulations and duties
 
04:36:26.910 --> 04:36:26.920 align:start position:0%
and expanding others the pro prohibition
 
04:36:28.789 --> 04:36:28.799 align:start position:0%
on technical educators of those
 
04:36:31.949 --> 04:36:31.959 align:start position:0%
professionally engaged in schoolwork has
 
04:36:35.109 --> 04:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
remained I am proposing that we we need
 
04:36:37.670 --> 04:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
need to change we need to bring a change
 
04:36:40.390 --> 04:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
to the board State Board of Education
 
04:36:42.629 --> 04:36:42.639 align:start position:0%
the state school board's role has been
 
04:36:44.310 --> 04:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
evolving over a hundred years and you
 
04:36:45.830 --> 04:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
can see on that one sheet all the
 
04:36:48.349 --> 04:36:48.359 align:start position:0%
different duties they had starting out
 
04:36:51.150 --> 04:36:51.160 align:start position:0%
with um but particularly in the last two
 
04:36:53.830 --> 04:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
or three decades overseeing our state
 
04:36:55.949 --> 04:36:55.959 align:start position:0%
education system is very complex and
 
04:36:58.349 --> 04:36:58.359 align:start position:0%
requires expertise in many areas
 
04:37:00.349 --> 04:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
building Aid Charter Schools remote
 
04:37:02.390 --> 04:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
learning um Extended Learning
 
04:37:03.990 --> 04:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
opportunities funding for special
 
04:37:06.029 --> 04:37:06.039 align:start position:0%
education adequate
 
04:37:08.709 --> 04:37:08.719 align:start position:0%
uh the state standards uh credentialing
 
04:37:10.230 --> 04:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
and the state's obligation and school
 
04:37:13.029 --> 04:37:13.039 align:start position:0%
funding just to name a few our
 
04:37:15.109 --> 04:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
postsecondary education system has
 
04:37:16.510 --> 04:37:16.520 align:start position:0%
expanded as well and needs
 
04:37:19.429 --> 04:37:19.439 align:start position:0%
representation on the board not only are
 
04:37:21.349 --> 04:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
there many many issues reports and
 
04:37:22.869 --> 04:37:22.879 align:start position:0%
decisions that the State Board of
 
04:37:25.590 --> 04:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
Education is charged with in statute at
 
04:37:28.510 --> 04:37:28.520 align:start position:0%
this time and it's hard to find them all
 
04:37:30.629 --> 04:37:30.639 align:start position:0%
because they're spread out throughout
 
04:37:33.510 --> 04:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
the statutes quite a bit um but issues
 
04:37:36.470 --> 04:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
in education at all levels increased uh
 
04:37:38.869 --> 04:37:38.879 align:start position:0%
became more complex and require a great
 
04:37:41.349 --> 04:37:41.359 align:start position:0%
deal of attention and expertise both in
 
04:37:43.429 --> 04:37:43.439 align:start position:0%
the field of Education as well as
 
04:37:45.510 --> 04:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
Finance law and
 
04:37:48.029 --> 04:37:48.039 align:start position:0%
business I would like to propose we now
 
04:37:50.551 --> 04:37:50.561 align:start position:0%
have seven positions on the State Board
 
04:37:53.109 --> 04:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
five of those positions are designated
 
04:37:55.189 --> 04:37:55.199 align:start position:0%
so that there's one from each executive
 
04:37:57.349 --> 04:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
Council District the other two are at
 
04:38:00.150 --> 04:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
large I am proposing that we increase
 
04:38:02.390 --> 04:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
the board to 11 members by including a
 
04:38:04.990 --> 04:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
public school classroom teacher a public
 
04:38:07.230 --> 04:38:07.240 align:start position:0%
School administrator a public school
 
04:38:10.670 --> 04:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
superintendent and a student um and that
 
04:38:12.590 --> 04:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
student I would almost suggest would be
 
04:38:14.830 --> 04:38:14.840 align:start position:0%
from our legislative youth advisory
 
04:38:17.551 --> 04:38:17.561 align:start position:0%
Council I think if you look on the sheet
 
04:38:19.990 --> 04:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
where I listed the different uh States
 
04:38:22.789 --> 04:38:22.799 align:start position:0%
and how their state board of education
 
04:38:25.269 --> 04:38:25.279 align:start position:0%
um is comprised several of them have a
 
04:38:28.590 --> 04:38:28.600 align:start position:0%
student representative on the board and
 
04:38:30.670 --> 04:38:30.680 align:start position:0%
several states have actually done
 
04:38:32.590 --> 04:38:32.600 align:start position:0%
reorganization of their State Board of
 
04:38:36.029 --> 04:38:36.039 align:start position:0%
Education in the last decade um this
 
04:38:38.990 --> 04:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
would give the board more people to put
 
04:38:41.349 --> 04:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
on subcommittees to study issues and
 
04:38:43.750 --> 04:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
handle the many tasks and reports that
 
04:38:46.029 --> 04:38:46.039 align:start position:0%
they're charged with the inclusion of
 
04:38:47.551 --> 04:38:47.561 align:start position:0%
Educators in the student would give the
 
04:38:49.869 --> 04:38:49.879 align:start position:0%
board more insight and information from
 
04:38:51.949 --> 04:38:51.959 align:start position:0%
the people delivering the education to
 
04:38:53.670 --> 04:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
the students of our state and what's
 
04:38:56.789 --> 04:38:56.799 align:start position:0%
going on right now as you can see on the
 
04:38:59.390 --> 04:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
second handout uh as I said it gives you
 
04:39:01.910 --> 04:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
a glimpse of the other states that that
 
04:39:04.029 --> 04:39:04.039 align:start position:0%
uh have prescribed positions for parents
 
04:39:05.830 --> 04:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
for example would be good to have a
 
04:39:08.470 --> 04:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
parent on the state school board and my
 
04:39:10.949 --> 04:39:10.959 align:start position:0%
favorite is one state has a non- voting
 
04:39:13.949 --> 04:39:13.959 align:start position:0%
place for the teacher of the year uh so
 
04:39:15.390 --> 04:39:15.400 align:start position:0%
the teacher of the year is appointed for
 
04:39:17.310 --> 04:39:17.320 align:start position:0%
a year and then the next year serves on
 
04:39:18.629 --> 04:39:18.639 align:start position:0%
the state school
 
04:39:22.269 --> 04:39:22.279 align:start position:0%
board no other state that in New England
 
04:39:25.510 --> 04:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
that I uh researched has prohibition
 
04:39:28.349 --> 04:39:28.359 align:start position:0%
against technical Educators but instead
 
04:39:30.990 --> 04:39:31.000 align:start position:0%
Embraces many stakeholders including
 
04:39:33.269 --> 04:39:33.279 align:start position:0%
Educators I realize this is a major
 
04:39:35.349 --> 04:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
change and should have input from all
 
04:39:37.590 --> 04:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to form a board whose
 
04:39:39.310 --> 04:39:39.320 align:start position:0%
composition better represents the
 
04:39:41.708 --> 04:39:41.718 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in our public school system
 
04:39:44.350 --> 04:39:44.360 align:start position:0%
while maintaining positions for spirited
 
04:39:46.948 --> 04:39:46.958 align:start position:0%
citizens interested in gaining an
 
04:39:48.430 --> 04:39:48.440 align:start position:0%
understanding of the educational need of
 
04:39:50.948 --> 04:39:50.958 align:start position:0%
the state and the best way to supply
 
04:39:55.590 --> 04:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
them uh as in the original charter um
 
04:39:57.270 --> 04:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
other states have have developed the
 
04:39:59.110 --> 04:39:59.120 align:start position:0%
commission to look at composition and
 
04:40:00.830 --> 04:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
duties of the State Board of Education
 
04:40:03.868 --> 04:40:03.878 align:start position:0%
as I said several of them have undergone
 
04:40:06.190 --> 04:40:06.200 align:start position:0%
changes and reorganizations and I
 
04:40:08.628 --> 04:40:08.638 align:start position:0%
suggest that this bill be a stepping off
 
04:40:11.868 --> 04:40:11.878 align:start position:0%
point for that thank you uh thank you
 
04:40:15.150 --> 04:40:15.160 align:start position:0%
representative questions representative
 
04:40:17.708 --> 04:40:17.718 align:start position:0%
uh McDonald thank you Mr chair and thank
 
04:40:19.230 --> 04:40:19.240 align:start position:0%
you representative Tanner for bringing
 
04:40:21.470 --> 04:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
this forward and I really appreciate the
 
04:40:23.190 --> 04:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
history lesson that you have in your
 
04:40:26.550 --> 04:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
wrri testimony here um the 19th
 
04:40:29.830 --> 04:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
amendment was ratified in 1920 not 1919
 
04:40:32.470 --> 04:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
but not withstanding um was there a
 
04:40:35.590 --> 04:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
particular incident that inspired this
 
04:40:37.110 --> 04:40:37.120 align:start position:0%
bill in New
 
04:40:39.750 --> 04:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I think we've had numerous
 
04:40:43.868 --> 04:40:43.878 align:start position:0%
occasions in this this um this committee
 
04:40:46.390 --> 04:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
to see uh some of the issues that are
 
04:40:48.230 --> 04:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
really going before the State Board of
 
04:40:50.470 --> 04:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
Education and how complex they are
 
04:40:54.750 --> 04:40:54.760 align:start position:0%
probably the 306s was one that uh really
 
04:40:58.030 --> 04:40:58.040 align:start position:0%
uh kind of Jarred me into the into uh
 
04:41:01.628 --> 04:41:01.638 align:start position:0%
suggesting this that uh we really um
 
04:41:03.350 --> 04:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
have gone round and round about the
 
04:41:05.708 --> 04:41:05.718 align:start position:0%
transparency and actually the 19th
 
04:41:07.948 --> 04:41:07.958 align:start position:0%
amendment was passed in 1919 but then
 
04:41:10.190 --> 04:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
ratified in 20 you're ready all right
 
04:41:10.200 --> 04:41:10.990 align:start position:0%
ratified in 20 you're ready all right
thank

04:41:10.990 --> 04:41:11.000 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:41:14.150 --> 04:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
you further questions representative
 
04:41:16.190 --> 04:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:41:18.830 --> 04:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
for bringing this bill forward uh so my
 
04:41:20.110 --> 04:41:20.120 align:start position:0%
question is
 
04:41:22.830 --> 04:41:22.840 align:start position:0%
that generally speaking so we
 
04:41:25.230 --> 04:41:25.240 align:start position:0%
don't as a society as a government we
 
04:41:27.230 --> 04:41:27.240 align:start position:0%
don't allow people actively employed in
 
04:41:29.030 --> 04:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
the pharmaceutical industry to regulate
 
04:41:31.310 --> 04:41:31.320 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals we don't act we don't
 
04:41:32.948 --> 04:41:32.958 align:start position:0%
allow people actively employed in
 
04:41:35.030 --> 04:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
banking to regulate the the banking
 
04:41:36.350 --> 04:41:36.360 align:start position:0%
industry so I'm wondering why this
 
04:41:38.670 --> 04:41:38.680 align:start position:0%
General principle of people should not
 
04:41:41.390 --> 04:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
be placed in a position to regulate the
 
04:41:43.190 --> 04:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
field in which they are employed why
 
04:41:46.070 --> 04:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
should that not hold true here first of
 
04:41:47.830 --> 04:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
all I I kind of disagree with your
 
04:41:50.230 --> 04:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
initial premise that that people from
 
04:41:52.750 --> 04:41:52.760 align:start position:0%
different Industries uh certainly uh
 
04:41:56.030 --> 04:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
Janet Yellen is pretty versed in um
 
04:41:58.230 --> 04:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
financial matters and has worked in
 
04:41:58.240 --> 04:41:59.350 align:start position:0%
financial matters and has worked in
financial

04:41:59.350 --> 04:41:59.360 align:start position:0%
financial
 
04:42:03.150 --> 04:42:03.160 align:start position:0%
institutions um and I think we also
 
04:42:05.110 --> 04:42:05.120 align:start position:0%
depend on lobbyists from time to time
 
04:42:07.788 --> 04:42:07.798 align:start position:0%
from different groups to write our bills
 
04:42:09.910 --> 04:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh and we've had bills that have been
 
04:42:12.150 --> 04:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
produced here from the State Department
 
04:42:14.628 --> 04:42:14.638 align:start position:0%
of Education uh that were written by
 
04:42:19.190 --> 04:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
them so to try to exclude people who
 
04:42:21.470 --> 04:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
have educational experience and
 
04:42:23.910 --> 04:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
educational Knowledge from such a
 
04:42:25.990 --> 04:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
fundamental part of what our school
 
04:42:29.708 --> 04:42:29.718 align:start position:0%
system is our state education system is
 
04:42:33.550 --> 04:42:33.560 align:start position:0%
I think is a is a gross uh
 
04:42:33.560 --> 04:42:35.830 align:start position:0%
I think is a is a gross uh
mistake

04:42:35.830 --> 04:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
mistake
 
04:42:40.270 --> 04:42:40.280 align:start position:0%
follow if I may just to clarify um is
 
04:42:42.270 --> 04:42:42.280 align:start position:0%
there a difference in your mind between
 
04:42:45.430 --> 04:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
those actively employed in educating and
 
04:42:47.390 --> 04:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
those who have General experience and
 
04:42:49.990 --> 04:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
knowledge um you know whether there is
 
04:42:51.270 --> 04:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
any general experience and knowledge
 
04:42:53.310 --> 04:42:53.320 align:start position:0%
already on the
 
04:42:56.550 --> 04:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
board I think that the board has to have
 
04:42:58.868 --> 04:42:58.878 align:start position:0%
input and should have
 
04:43:00.708 --> 04:43:00.718 align:start position:0%
representation they're still going to
 
04:43:03.110 --> 04:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
maintain those five people one from each
 
04:43:05.390 --> 04:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
district in the in the two people that
 
04:43:07.708 --> 04:43:07.718 align:start position:0%
are at large so they still have the
 
04:43:10.070 --> 04:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
fundamental basics of the board the
 
04:43:12.830 --> 04:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
thing that they this bill does is add to
 
04:43:15.510 --> 04:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
it the student and the people that are
 
04:43:18.190 --> 04:43:18.200 align:start position:0%
involved in public education now in
 
04:43:21.310 --> 04:43:21.320 align:start position:0%
order to participate on the board I'm
 
04:43:22.910 --> 04:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
probably going to say it's like
 
04:43:24.510 --> 04:43:24.520 align:start position:0%
participating on this education
 
04:43:26.948 --> 04:43:26.958 align:start position:0%
committee uh if you're an active teacher
 
04:43:26.958 --> 04:43:28.150 align:start position:0%
committee uh if you're an active teacher
active

04:43:28.150 --> 04:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
active
 
04:43:30.628 --> 04:43:30.638 align:start position:0%
superintendent um even if you're a
 
04:43:32.948 --> 04:43:32.958 align:start position:0%
student it it's going to be difficult
 
04:43:34.910 --> 04:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
for you to come to a state Board of
 
04:43:37.190 --> 04:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
Education that meets on a Thursday from
 
04:43:38.510 --> 04:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
8:00 in the morning or 9:00 in the
 
04:43:40.030 --> 04:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
morning until whenever they get work
 
04:43:43.830 --> 04:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
done so I see it more I think what is
 
04:43:46.030 --> 04:43:46.040 align:start position:0%
going to happen is it probably be people
 
04:43:48.030 --> 04:43:48.040 align:start position:0%
retired or people that are on sabatical
 
04:43:53.350 --> 04:43:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:55.910 --> 04:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
this further questions representative
 
04:43:58.310 --> 04:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
dry thank you Mr chairman and thanks for
 
04:44:00.310 --> 04:44:00.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question so in this committee
 
04:44:04.628 --> 04:44:04.638 align:start position:0%
we've been trying to reduce um committee
 
04:44:08.230 --> 04:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
rzes um a lot because of the you know
 
04:44:09.868 --> 04:44:09.878 align:start position:0%
there's a certain number when you get
 
04:44:12.230 --> 04:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
things get start to get um difficult and
 
04:44:14.788 --> 04:44:14.798 align:start position:0%
combersome to do business and I usually
 
04:44:17.590 --> 04:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
see expansion on committees if there's a
 
04:44:20.150 --> 04:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
problem like getting a quorum or um
 
04:44:21.670 --> 04:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
people showing up to this do you have
 
04:44:24.750 --> 04:44:24.760 align:start position:0%
any idea if people on the State Board of
 
04:44:26.390 --> 04:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
Education have been like diligent to
 
04:44:28.110 --> 04:44:28.120 align:start position:0%
show up is there any problem in that
 
04:44:31.708 --> 04:44:31.718 align:start position:0%
area well I know they do remote so uh
 
04:44:34.350 --> 04:44:34.360 align:start position:0%
the people can come in on remote to the
 
04:44:36.670 --> 04:44:36.680 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education I think
 
04:44:39.708 --> 04:44:39.718 align:start position:0%
committees uh need to be big enough so
 
04:44:41.670 --> 04:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
that they can handle all the duties and
 
04:44:44.788 --> 04:44:44.798 align:start position:0%
like I said if you if you have a weekend
 
04:44:47.070 --> 04:44:47.080 align:start position:0%
where you would like to peruse through
 
04:44:49.948 --> 04:44:49.958 align:start position:0%
just the small booklet that we have on
 
04:44:52.590 --> 04:44:52.600 align:start position:0%
the education laws and underline all the
 
04:44:54.350 --> 04:44:54.360 align:start position:0%
places where the St State Board of
 
04:44:56.830 --> 04:44:56.840 align:start position:0%
Education either has a report or as part
 
04:45:00.470 --> 04:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
of a decision-making process um you'd be
 
04:45:03.150 --> 04:45:03.160 align:start position:0%
amazed I mean I I gave up after a while
 
04:45:05.550 --> 04:45:05.560 align:start position:0%
it was just too many and I think having
 
04:45:08.430 --> 04:45:08.440 align:start position:0%
more people and again looking at some of
 
04:45:10.310 --> 04:45:10.320 align:start position:0%
these boards in Massachusetts Rhode
 
04:45:14.030 --> 04:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
Island Vermont uh Maine that that they
 
04:45:16.670 --> 04:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
often have subcommittees that they have
 
04:45:19.150 --> 04:45:19.160 align:start position:0%
for example one one of the states and I
 
04:45:21.990 --> 04:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
can't remember exactly which one is had
 
04:45:24.390 --> 04:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee just for secondary Ed for
 
04:45:26.670 --> 04:45:26.680 align:start position:0%
post-secondary Education which probably
 
04:45:28.868 --> 04:45:28.878 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a bad idea for our our board
 
04:45:31.550 --> 04:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
to do but with only seven people on the
 
04:45:34.510 --> 04:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
board I think um expanding it to 11 is
 
04:45:37.990 --> 04:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
not going to make uh any
 
04:45:40.550 --> 04:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
overdue uh burden on the number of
 
04:45:42.948 --> 04:45:42.958 align:start position:0%
people follow follow up go ahead thank
 
04:45:46.708 --> 04:45:46.718 align:start position:0%
you so the we're increasing it by about
 
04:45:50.470 --> 04:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
more than 50% um there's a geographic
 
04:45:52.708 --> 04:45:52.718 align:start position:0%
restriction on a number of the members
 
04:45:54.510 --> 04:45:54.520 align:start position:0%
already but it doesn't seem like there's
 
04:45:56.750 --> 04:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
any Geographic constriction on what you
 
04:45:59.350 --> 04:45:59.360 align:start position:0%
want to put in right it's it's moving
 
04:46:01.910 --> 04:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
from 7 to 11 which is not
 
04:46:05.350 --> 04:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
50% um but it's it's also that when the
 
04:46:08.310 --> 04:46:08.320 align:start position:0%
first uh School Board of Education was
 
04:46:10.990 --> 04:46:11.000 align:start position:0%
devised uh one of the in in the history
 
04:46:13.830 --> 04:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
lesson that's in here um they wrote
 
04:46:16.470 --> 04:46:16.480 align:start position:0%
extensively about it there was a real um
 
04:46:19.788 --> 04:46:19.798 align:start position:0%
effort to get to to get down on writing
 
04:46:21.510 --> 04:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
what actually people were thinking about
 
04:46:23.510 --> 04:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
at the time and of course there weren't
 
04:46:26.070 --> 04:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
professional Educators at the time um
 
04:46:29.470 --> 04:46:29.480 align:start position:0%
except at the college level and they um
 
04:46:32.310 --> 04:46:32.320 align:start position:0%
wanted people from all Pursuits uh
 
04:46:34.868 --> 04:46:34.878 align:start position:0%
agricultural Financial you know
 
04:46:36.430 --> 04:46:36.440 align:start position:0%
different they actually listed out
 
04:46:37.948 --> 04:46:37.958 align:start position:0%
different areas that they wanted people
 
04:46:41.230 --> 04:46:41.240 align:start position:0%
from and they wanted spirited citizens
 
04:46:42.948 --> 04:46:42.958 align:start position:0%
that would be interested in learning
 
04:46:46.190 --> 04:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
about education and helping provide this
 
04:46:49.390 --> 04:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
new educational system that was going to
 
04:46:52.708 --> 04:46:52.718 align:start position:0%
put State funding into rural areas um
 
04:46:55.830 --> 04:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
start credentialing teachers and uh
 
04:46:58.270 --> 04:46:58.280 align:start position:0%
people that worked in schools and like I
 
04:47:01.788 --> 04:47:01.798 align:start position:0%
said now we're from those basic 13 12 or
 
04:47:04.708 --> 04:47:04.718 align:start position:0%
13 duties they had we are up in the
 
04:47:06.788 --> 04:47:06.798 align:start position:0%
probably several hundred duties that
 
04:47:09.670 --> 04:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
they have thank you further questions
 
04:47:12.230 --> 04:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
from the committee thank you very much
 
04:47:12.240 --> 04:47:13.390 align:start position:0%
from the committee thank you very much

bitman
 
04:47:42.910 --> 04:47:42.920 align:start position:0%
hello um I am uh speaking on HB 1437 I'm
 
04:47:46.990 --> 04:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
opposed to this um couple of things that
 
04:47:49.150 --> 04:47:49.160 align:start position:0%
um representative beler already
 
04:47:52.510 --> 04:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned that I felt like that the
 
04:47:54.948 --> 04:47:54.958 align:start position:0%
classroom teacher and administrator and
 
04:47:57.628 --> 04:47:57.638 align:start position:0%
such should not be on uh the school
 
04:48:01.510 --> 04:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
board I was uh fortunate enough to work
 
04:48:03.590 --> 04:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
with a gentleman in my town uh who
 
04:48:05.110 --> 04:48:05.120 align:start position:0%
needed to clean out his basement he was
 
04:48:08.070 --> 04:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
87 years old and his wife collected
 
04:48:10.430 --> 04:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
every single newspaper of Our Town
 
04:48:13.510 --> 04:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
Newspaper and um in one of the Articles
 
04:48:15.350 --> 04:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
as we were going through because he was
 
04:48:16.990 --> 04:48:17.000 align:start position:0%
looking for something I don't remember
 
04:48:18.670 --> 04:48:18.680 align:start position:0%
which article he was looking for but
 
04:48:20.708 --> 04:48:20.718 align:start position:0%
there was very big discussion back in
 
04:48:24.150 --> 04:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
the early 80s about having teachers on
 
04:48:26.628 --> 04:48:26.638 align:start position:0%
the school board in the small town and
 
04:48:28.230 --> 04:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
my small town we used to have little
 
04:48:31.430 --> 04:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
school houses um because and then we
 
04:48:33.510 --> 04:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
didn't even have a kindergarten until in
 
04:48:33.520 --> 04:48:34.390 align:start position:0%
didn't even have a kindergarten until in
the'80s

04:48:34.390 --> 04:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
the'80s
 
04:48:37.788 --> 04:48:37.798 align:start position:0%
1980s so um very small town in New
 
04:48:40.750 --> 04:48:40.760 align:start position:0%
Boston so there was very big discussion
 
04:48:43.030 --> 04:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
now granted at that point the reason to
 
04:48:44.868 --> 04:48:44.878 align:start position:0%
have the teachers not be on the school
 
04:48:46.990 --> 04:48:47.000 align:start position:0%
board was because of contractual and
 
04:48:51.230 --> 04:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
having influence over that um my concern
 
04:48:53.150 --> 04:48:53.160 align:start position:0%
is is if there needs to be an increased
 
04:48:56.150 --> 04:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
number in uh people on this committee
 
04:48:58.110 --> 04:48:58.120 align:start position:0%
why aren't you increasing that each
 
04:49:01.910 --> 04:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
district has one more person from it um
 
04:49:05.230 --> 04:49:05.240 align:start position:0%
also on line 14 um terms of office said
 
04:49:07.390 --> 04:49:07.400 align:start position:0%
for four years on the State Board of
 
04:49:09.590 --> 04:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
Education uh website it says it's a
 
04:49:12.868 --> 04:49:12.878 align:start position:0%
5-year term I don't know which one's
 
04:49:14.750 --> 04:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
incorrect um because I'm not
 
04:49:19.350 --> 04:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable on that and um so and if
 
04:49:22.350 --> 04:49:22.360 align:start position:0%
you need experts and you are allowed to
 
04:49:23.590 --> 04:49:23.600 align:start position:0%
go to the State Board of Education I've
 
04:49:25.150 --> 04:49:25.160 align:start position:0%
gone there a couple times and voice your
 
04:49:26.910 --> 04:49:26.920 align:start position:0%
concerns and test and do testimony you
 
04:49:29.670 --> 04:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
can do remote testimony just like here
 
04:49:31.910 --> 04:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
so it's not like we can't have that
 
04:49:35.070 --> 04:49:35.080 align:start position:0%
expert um opinion or information and
 
04:49:37.070 --> 04:49:37.080 align:start position:0%
then you you have one teacher and I will
 
04:49:38.390 --> 04:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
tell you a middle school teacher High
 
04:49:39.830 --> 04:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
School teacher and elementary teacher
 
04:49:42.548 --> 04:49:42.558 align:start position:0%
school teacher have vast difference
 
04:49:44.948 --> 04:49:44.958 align:start position:0%
views about what is needed in a school
 
04:49:47.150 --> 04:49:47.160 align:start position:0%
and what they would like to have focused
 
04:49:50.750 --> 04:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
on in a school so that's it thank you
 
04:49:52.390 --> 04:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh are you willing
 
04:49:54.310 --> 04:49:54.320 align:start position:0%
to take questions sure are there any
 
04:49:56.990 --> 04:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee I doubt it
 
04:49:59.948 --> 04:49:59.958 align:start position:0%
oh thank you very much thank you uh I'd
 
04:50:02.830 --> 04:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:02.840 --> 04:50:11.830 align:start position:0%

04:50:22.948 --> 04:50:22.958 align:start position:0%
opposition to hb1 1437 I submitted a
 
04:50:24.868 --> 04:50:24.878 align:start position:0%
written testimony through the web portal
 
04:50:27.350 --> 04:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
which you probably don't have yet um
 
04:50:28.470 --> 04:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
because I submitted it right before it
 
04:50:30.670 --> 04:50:30.680 align:start position:0%
came so I won't go into great depth but
 
04:50:32.670 --> 04:50:32.680 align:start position:0%
I will just outline the bullet points of
 
04:50:36.788 --> 04:50:36.798 align:start position:0%
my testimony that I submitted online
 
04:50:39.750 --> 04:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
um when you look back to the origin of
 
04:50:42.230 --> 04:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education in 1919 is
 
04:50:44.310 --> 04:50:44.320 align:start position:0%
and you read the legislative debates and
 
04:50:46.190 --> 04:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
the house committee House Education
 
04:50:49.430 --> 04:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
committee uh records from back then it
 
04:50:52.670 --> 04:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
is crystal clear that the legislature
 
04:50:56.030 --> 04:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
intended to create a very Democratic
 
04:50:58.070 --> 04:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
Board of Education a very democratic
 
04:51:00.628 --> 04:51:00.638 align:start position:0%
system of oversight of public education
 
04:51:03.948 --> 04:51:03.958 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education is a gem
 
04:51:06.990 --> 04:51:07.000 align:start position:0%
it's a democratic gem in New Hampshire's
 
04:51:07.000 --> 04:51:08.190 align:start position:0%
it's a democratic gem in New Hampshire's
governance

04:51:08.190 --> 04:51:08.200 align:start position:0%
governance
 
04:51:11.830 --> 04:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
structure they intended very very
 
04:51:15.270 --> 04:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
specifically to create citizen oversight
 
04:51:17.788 --> 04:51:17.798 align:start position:0%
of professional Educators and I'd like
 
04:51:19.350 --> 04:51:19.360 align:start position:0%
to correct something you said earlier
 
04:51:20.510 --> 04:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
there were in fact professional
 
04:51:21.948 --> 04:51:21.958 align:start position:0%
Educators in New Hampshire in the early
 
04:51:24.830 --> 04:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
20th century the Board of Education was
 
04:51:28.110 --> 04:51:28.120 align:start position:0%
created to create citizen oversight of
 
04:51:29.628 --> 04:51:29.638 align:start position:0%
professional Educators in my written
 
04:51:32.310 --> 04:51:32.320 align:start position:0%
testimony I quote some of the findings
 
04:51:34.750 --> 04:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
from that committee
 
04:51:37.470 --> 04:51:37.480 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire's structure was uh
 
04:51:40.350 --> 04:51:40.360 align:start position:0%
largely copied from Vermont which had
 
04:51:42.070 --> 04:51:42.080 align:start position:0%
passed something similar a few years
 
04:51:45.868 --> 04:51:45.878 align:start position:0%
before they only spelled out two
 
04:51:48.670 --> 04:51:48.680 align:start position:0%
criteria for Board of Education members
 
04:51:50.110 --> 04:51:50.120 align:start position:0%
that you not be
 
04:51:52.590 --> 04:51:52.600 align:start position:0%
paid and that you be a lay person who
 
04:51:55.190 --> 04:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
was not currently a practicing educator
 
04:51:57.070 --> 04:51:57.080 align:start position:0%
and those were very deliberate they
 
04:51:59.548 --> 04:51:59.558 align:start position:0%
didn't want the board to be corrupted by
 
04:52:01.948 --> 04:52:01.958 align:start position:0%
any sort of compensation they wanted
 
04:52:03.990 --> 04:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
them to be volunteers citizen volunteers
 
04:52:06.310 --> 04:52:06.320 align:start position:0%
years and they
 
04:52:10.190 --> 04:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
wanted in the records you can see they
 
04:52:12.070 --> 04:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to prevent factionalism that
 
04:52:14.230 --> 04:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
would happen by having professional
 
04:52:16.990 --> 04:52:17.000 align:start position:0%
Educators serving on the oversight board
 
04:52:18.350 --> 04:52:18.360 align:start position:0%
so there were two things and to
 
04:52:20.310 --> 04:52:20.320 align:start position:0%
representative bel's point that they
 
04:52:24.788 --> 04:52:24.798 align:start position:0%
were very clear they wanted to avoid was
 
04:52:27.868 --> 04:52:27.878 align:start position:0%
micromanaging content and stuff that
 
04:52:29.868 --> 04:52:29.878 align:start position:0%
really ought to belong at the local
 
04:52:32.150 --> 04:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
level and one of their fears was if you
 
04:52:33.788 --> 04:52:33.798 align:start position:0%
put professional Educators on the State
 
04:52:36.590 --> 04:52:36.600 align:start position:0%
Board of Education they would get mired
 
04:52:39.030 --> 04:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
down in these factional conflicts
 
04:52:41.750 --> 04:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
between differences of opinion
 
04:52:45.350 --> 04:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
about content curriculum pedagogical
 
04:52:48.310 --> 04:52:48.320 align:start position:0%
stuff practice all those things they did
 
04:52:49.868 --> 04:52:49.878 align:start position:0%
they wanted to keep that off of the
 
04:52:50.990 --> 04:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
State Board of
 
04:52:54.390 --> 04:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
Education and they wanted to prevent
 
04:52:58.030 --> 04:52:58.040 align:start position:0%
corruption and by that I mean just very
 
04:53:00.910 --> 04:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
simply it is good standard governance
 
04:53:03.230 --> 04:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
practice to not have professionals on
 
04:53:05.750 --> 04:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
the board overseeing themselves so they
 
04:53:07.548 --> 04:53:07.558 align:start position:0%
wanted to draw a clear
 
04:53:11.110 --> 04:53:11.120 align:start position:0%
line this bill would destroy that
 
04:53:13.628 --> 04:53:13.638 align:start position:0%
balance over the years this the
 
04:53:16.270 --> 04:53:16.280 align:start position:0%
legislature has seen fit to create
 
04:53:18.548 --> 04:53:18.558 align:start position:0%
structures to give the State Board of
 
04:53:21.868 --> 04:53:21.878 align:start position:0%
Education made up of lay people input
 
04:53:24.070 --> 04:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
from professional Educators so the
 
04:53:25.470 --> 04:53:25.480 align:start position:0%
legislature created the Professional
 
04:53:25.480 --> 04:53:26.750 align:start position:0%
legislature created the Professional
Standards

04:53:26.750 --> 04:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
Standards
 
04:53:29.070 --> 04:53:29.080 align:start position:0%
Board the Professional Standards Board
 
04:53:31.590 --> 04:53:31.600 align:start position:0%
advises the Board of Education when we
 
04:53:35.150 --> 04:53:35.160 align:start position:0%
do rulemaking they give us very
 
04:53:38.470 --> 04:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
good insightful input that we listen to
 
04:53:40.548 --> 04:53:40.558 align:start position:0%
very attentively we do have
 
04:53:41.830 --> 04:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
communications with professional
 
04:53:43.670 --> 04:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
Educators not only do we get that
 
04:53:45.270 --> 04:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
through the Professional Standards Board
 
04:53:48.190 --> 04:53:48.200 align:start position:0%
which really drafts the first draft of
 
04:53:51.548 --> 04:53:51.558 align:start position:0%
all of our rules that govern um
 
04:53:54.070 --> 04:53:54.080 align:start position:0%
licensing and that sort of thing for for
 
04:53:56.708 --> 04:53:56.718 align:start position:0%
educators that first draft comes
 
04:53:59.430 --> 04:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
from professional Educators is not
 
04:54:01.548 --> 04:54:01.558 align:start position:0%
thought up by the the lay people on the
 
04:54:03.190 --> 04:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
board of ed so we take that and then we
 
04:54:06.628 --> 04:54:06.638 align:start position:0%
go it and review it and tweak it and
 
04:54:08.708 --> 04:54:08.718 align:start position:0%
make it our own or sometimes we take it
 
04:54:10.150 --> 04:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
as it is because we don't have any
 
04:54:13.390 --> 04:54:13.400 align:start position:0%
changes um and we take input we have
 
04:54:15.470 --> 04:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
public hearings all the rul making goes
 
04:54:17.350 --> 04:54:17.360 align:start position:0%
through regular process we have public
 
04:54:19.750 --> 04:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
hearings and those public hearings
 
04:54:21.590 --> 04:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
typically if anyone shows up at all it's
 
04:54:26.150 --> 04:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
professional Educators who show up um so
 
04:54:28.750 --> 04:54:28.760 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it at that um I think this
 
04:54:33.030 --> 04:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
would seriously um upend the sort of
 
04:54:33.040 --> 04:54:34.110 align:start position:0%
would seriously um upend the sort of
civilian

04:54:34.110 --> 04:54:34.120 align:start position:0%
civilian
 
04:54:36.948 --> 04:54:36.958 align:start position:0%
oversight that the legislator created
 
04:54:39.230 --> 04:54:39.240 align:start position:0%
105 years ago that works very well in
 
04:54:41.310 --> 04:54:41.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and in fact um
 
04:54:43.350 --> 04:54:43.360 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts also prohibits uh
 
04:54:45.070 --> 04:54:45.080 align:start position:0%
professional Educators from serving on
 
04:54:47.390 --> 04:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
their Board of Education uh in my
 
04:54:49.510 --> 04:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
written testimony I I think I wrote that
 
04:54:50.868 --> 04:54:50.878 align:start position:0%
I was drafting the end of it very
 
04:54:52.230 --> 04:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
quickly I think I said that no New
 
04:54:55.750 --> 04:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
England State um has professional
 
04:54:58.430 --> 04:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
Educators on their board uh Connecticut
 
04:55:00.270 --> 04:55:00.280 align:start position:0%
is the one state that has the teacher of
 
04:55:02.868 --> 04:55:02.878 align:start position:0%
the year serve a one-year term on their
 
04:55:04.590 --> 04:55:04.600 align:start position:0%
Board of Ed
 
04:55:06.310 --> 04:55:06.320 align:start position:0%
but nowhere else that I was able to find
 
04:55:09.070 --> 04:55:09.080 align:start position:0%
does that thank you very much Mr clown I
 
04:55:12.788 --> 04:55:12.798 align:start position:0%
have a question for you yeah um when we
 
04:55:16.110 --> 04:55:16.120 align:start position:0%
are serving by that the public as well
 
04:55:17.868 --> 04:55:17.878 align:start position:0%
on a commission such as we have the
 
04:55:20.750 --> 04:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
Civics commission going on right now
 
04:55:23.948 --> 04:55:23.958 align:start position:0%
prior to serving one has to fill out a
 
04:55:25.628 --> 04:55:25.638 align:start position:0%
form from the Secretary of State's
 
04:55:27.590 --> 04:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
office declaring if whe they have any
 
04:55:30.030 --> 04:55:30.040 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest ET could you please
 
04:55:33.070 --> 04:55:33.080 align:start position:0%
explain uh how that works and why we
 
04:55:33.990 --> 04:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
have it
 
04:55:35.628 --> 04:55:35.638 align:start position:0%
well uh we have to fill up Financial
 
04:55:37.230 --> 04:55:37.240 align:start position:0%
disclosure forms as well uh for the
 
04:55:39.110 --> 04:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education and the point
 
04:55:42.030 --> 04:55:42.040 align:start position:0%
is to um disclose to the members of the
 
04:55:44.708 --> 04:55:44.718 align:start position:0%
public if you being compensated by any
 
04:55:46.628 --> 04:55:46.638 align:start position:0%
uh entity that you regulate to avoid a
 
04:55:49.470 --> 04:55:49.480 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest so um hb1 1437
 
04:55:52.830 --> 04:55:52.840 align:start position:0%
would clearly uh run in contradiction to
 
04:55:54.990 --> 04:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
that disclosure um and the concept
 
04:55:56.230 --> 04:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
behind that disclosure that you don't
 
04:56:00.390 --> 04:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
have a financial interest in the um
 
04:56:02.510 --> 04:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
professionals professions that you're
 
04:56:02.520 --> 04:56:04.230 align:start position:0%
professionals professions that you're
regulating

04:56:04.230 --> 04:56:04.240 align:start position:0%
regulating
 
04:56:06.510 --> 04:56:06.520 align:start position:0%
we also have and just to make a final
 
04:56:06.520 --> 04:56:08.310 align:start position:0%
we also have and just to make a final
Point

04:56:08.310 --> 04:56:08.320 align:start position:0%
Point
 
04:56:11.948 --> 04:56:11.958 align:start position:0%
um we we write rules for educators and
 
04:56:13.830 --> 04:56:13.840 align:start position:0%
we have Educators some testify in those
 
04:56:16.510 --> 04:56:16.520 align:start position:0%
rules and sometimes you have difference
 
04:56:18.548 --> 04:56:18.558 align:start position:0%
of opinion between teachers and uh
 
04:56:20.948 --> 04:56:20.958 align:start position:0%
principles and superintendents on how
 
04:56:22.230 --> 04:56:22.240 align:start position:0%
these things and we take a lot of
 
04:56:24.548 --> 04:56:24.558 align:start position:0%
feedback we work very well I think with
 
04:56:25.708 --> 04:56:25.718 align:start position:0%
a lot of those professional
 
04:56:28.150 --> 04:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
organizations um we strive very hard to
 
04:56:30.670 --> 04:56:30.680 align:start position:0%
to take their input seriously and to get
 
04:56:33.510 --> 04:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
um develop good relationships with them
 
04:56:37.430 --> 04:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
um it would clearly be a conflict of
 
04:56:39.070 --> 04:56:39.080 align:start position:0%
interest to have a sitting practicing
 
04:56:41.868 --> 04:56:41.878 align:start position:0%
education professional writing the rules
 
04:56:43.788 --> 04:56:43.798 align:start position:0%
that that govern those education
 
04:56:45.948 --> 04:56:45.958 align:start position:0%
professionals there's just no way around
 
04:56:47.750 --> 04:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
that thank you very much are there
 
04:56:49.070 --> 04:56:49.080 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee yes
 
04:56:49.080 --> 04:56:51.190 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee yes
represented

04:56:51.190 --> 04:56:51.200 align:start position:0%
represented
 
04:56:53.310 --> 04:56:53.320 align:start position:0%
Balon thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:56:55.830 --> 04:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm sorry I don't
 
04:56:57.830 --> 04:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
know this but maybe it's publicized
 
04:57:00.750 --> 04:57:00.760 align:start position:0%
somewhere but um how are members of the
 
04:57:02.990 --> 04:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education chosen is there
 
04:57:05.510 --> 04:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
not appliation process um they're
 
04:57:07.670 --> 04:57:07.680 align:start position:0%

05:15:56.480 --> 05:15:57.670 align:start position:0%
Edwards I represent uh Rockingham
District

05:15:57.670 --> 05:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
District
 
05:16:02.310 --> 05:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
31 uh I've gotten a lot of input from my
 
05:16:05.270 --> 05:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
community a lot of people who generally
 
05:16:10.430 --> 05:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
oppose me have asked me to support
 
05:16:13.708 --> 05:16:13.718 align:start position:0%
1205 uh I would have supported 1205
 
05:16:17.948 --> 05:16:17.958 align:start position:0%
anyways I have two mothers Five Sisters
 
05:16:20.230 --> 05:16:20.240 align:start position:0%
two daughters and a granddaughter there
 
05:16:23.230 --> 05:16:23.240 align:start position:0%
are no men associated with my family
 
05:16:25.830 --> 05:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
it's all women that I'm very proud of
 
05:16:29.430 --> 05:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
very strong people I served 33 years in
 
05:16:31.788 --> 05:16:31.798 align:start position:0%
the Army to try to go find some somebody
 
05:16:34.150 --> 05:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
other than the women in my life so I I
 
05:16:36.548 --> 05:16:36.558 align:start position:0%
found some men to hang out with but
 
05:16:38.548 --> 05:16:38.558 align:start position:0%
while I was there I also found out that
 
05:16:41.548 --> 05:16:41.558 align:start position:0%
we had a tremendous number of women who
 
05:16:45.910 --> 05:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
served and as one of the officers my job
 
05:16:49.030 --> 05:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
included making sure that everyone was
 
05:16:52.788 --> 05:16:52.798 align:start position:0%
physically capable of serving in a
 
05:16:55.868 --> 05:16:55.878 align:start position:0%
hostile combat environment it was a very
 
05:16:59.230 --> 05:16:59.240 align:start position:0%
exacting very demanding uh realistic
 
05:17:01.948 --> 05:17:01.958 align:start position:0%
environment that we train people for
 
05:17:05.230 --> 05:17:05.240 align:start position:0%
and when we do this we use a physical
 
05:17:07.788 --> 05:17:07.798 align:start position:0%
fitness test in the army that gets
 
05:17:10.868 --> 05:17:10.878 align:start position:0%
normed differently so that's it's easier
 
05:17:13.070 --> 05:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
for women to get a very high score
 
05:17:16.270 --> 05:17:16.280 align:start position:0%
compared to men uh I was an okay athlete
 
05:17:18.590 --> 05:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
I never got a pretty good score I got
 
05:17:21.910 --> 05:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
okay scores uh but women were constantly
 
05:17:25.230 --> 05:17:25.240 align:start position:0%
getting uh perfect scores for doing much
 
05:17:30.270 --> 05:17:30.280 align:start position:0%
less than me and they were advantaged by
 
05:17:32.430 --> 05:17:32.440 align:start position:0%
promotions and being recognized and the
 
05:17:37.310 --> 05:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
like which is all fine and great um so
 
05:17:38.548 --> 05:17:38.558 align:start position:0%
so the
 
05:17:41.470 --> 05:17:41.480 align:start position:0%
Army even though we trained for the same
 
05:17:43.548 --> 05:17:43.558 align:start position:0%
environment we trained to different
 
05:17:46.390 --> 05:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
physical standards we did that because
 
05:17:50.030 --> 05:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
in the military you have
 
05:17:53.750 --> 05:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
to take care that you practice reality
 
05:17:56.110 --> 05:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
so this was reality-based training sex
 
05:17:58.910 --> 05:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
segregation makes sense gone beyond your
 
05:18:03.590 --> 05:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
two minutes can I just two two s so my
 
05:18:07.190 --> 05:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
dad taught me men don't hit women and
 
05:18:09.750 --> 05:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
men should help women protect female
 
05:18:13.470 --> 05:18:13.480 align:start position:0%
sport not destroy them female sport
 
05:18:15.708 --> 05:18:15.718 align:start position:0%
makes sense thank you thank you very
 
05:18:17.830 --> 05:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
much are there questions for the
 
05:18:20.670 --> 05:18:20.680 align:start position:0%
representative thank you very much uh
 
05:18:25.910 --> 05:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:28.470 --> 05:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
Moffett famous here moving fast here I
 
05:18:31.190 --> 05:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
know you're uh have some limits on time
 
05:18:33.750 --> 05:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh nice to be back in education uh I'm
 
05:18:35.948 --> 05:18:35.958 align:start position:0%
for the record Mike mord marac for
 
05:18:38.510 --> 05:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
Canterbury Lowden also a sports guy as
 
05:18:41.430 --> 05:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
some of you know uh ref from Conway I
 
05:18:42.948 --> 05:18:42.958 align:start position:0%
think reads my sports column from time
 
05:18:47.548 --> 05:18:47.558 align:start position:0%
to time or so I heard so anyway uh uh
 
05:18:50.628 --> 05:18:50.638 align:start position:0%
can 10 seconds say again rip from Conway
 
05:18:52.910 --> 05:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
my wife lik oh uh for the record his
 
05:18:55.270 --> 05:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
wife likes my sports col all right so
 
05:18:58.628 --> 05:18:58.638 align:start position:0%
back to my time um this is not as easy
 
05:19:00.230 --> 05:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
topic as some people may think I was on
 
05:19:01.948 --> 05:19:01.958 align:start position:0%
this committee three years a we had a
 
05:19:05.310 --> 05:19:05.320 align:start position:0%
during Co we had a hearing uh 32 out of
 
05:19:09.030 --> 05:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
33 people who testified were were
 
05:19:10.750 --> 05:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
standing up for their trans kids and
 
05:19:13.110 --> 05:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
that changed me moved the needle for me
 
05:19:16.390 --> 05:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
broaden my awareness understand them ADV
 
05:19:17.510 --> 05:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
advocating for the kids now there's
 
05:19:19.230 --> 05:19:19.240 align:start position:0%
other parents who also going to advocate
 
05:19:20.708 --> 05:19:20.718 align:start position:0%
for their kids in a different way you'll
 
05:19:22.990 --> 05:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
hear from them today I am a
 
05:19:26.390 --> 05:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor um there mostly moms uh but
 
05:19:28.948 --> 05:19:28.958 align:start position:0%
also dads so I want to make one point
 
05:19:31.948 --> 05:19:31.958 align:start position:0%
and it has to do with safety uh I had a
 
05:19:33.830 --> 05:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
couple daughters who played soccer
 
05:19:35.990 --> 05:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
conquered High School Crimson Tide one
 
05:19:37.830 --> 05:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
was a goalkeeper one was a striker if
 
05:19:39.788 --> 05:19:39.798 align:start position:0%
anybody ever had a kid who's a
 
05:19:42.070 --> 05:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
goalkeeper it's no fun to watch you
 
05:19:45.990 --> 05:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
watch a kid out scoring so anyway
 
05:19:48.750 --> 05:19:48.760 align:start position:0%
conquered at glown my daughter Katie was
 
05:19:52.868 --> 05:19:52.878 align:start position:0%
a goalkeeper a 5050 ball two uh people
 
05:19:54.628 --> 05:19:54.638 align:start position:0%
going different directions for the ball
 
05:19:58.190 --> 05:19:58.200 align:start position:0%
Collision broken leg uh ambulance on the
 
05:20:00.750 --> 05:20:00.760 align:start position:0%
field screaming um it was not my
 
05:20:02.548 --> 05:20:02.558 align:start position:0%
daughter broke her leg it was the other
 
05:20:07.910 --> 05:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
girl who ran into my daughter uh so uh
 
05:20:10.110 --> 05:20:10.120 align:start position:0%
5050 balls those of you are sports
 
05:20:13.390 --> 05:20:13.400 align:start position:0%
people 5050 balls when there's two
 
05:20:15.350 --> 05:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
people the same shot at the ball happens
 
05:20:17.150 --> 05:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
in field hockey happens in ice hockey
 
05:20:19.270 --> 05:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
certainly happens in soccer so my point
 
05:20:22.548 --> 05:20:22.558 align:start position:0%
I want to make is that with these 5050
 
05:20:25.310 --> 05:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
balls I Katie was 120 pounds or whatever
 
05:20:27.030 --> 05:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
and she went in there and broke the leg
 
05:20:29.270 --> 05:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
of somebody who was 120 pounds but if
 
05:20:31.868 --> 05:20:31.878 align:start position:0%
you have a 100 pound
 
05:20:37.670 --> 05:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
girl and 160 170 pound uh XY chromosome
 
05:20:39.910 --> 05:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
guy it's a safety issue it's something
 
05:20:41.990 --> 05:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
that needs to be acknowledged and
 
05:20:44.150 --> 05:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
addressed so what's the answer I think
 
05:20:47.708 --> 05:20:47.718 align:start position:0%
the answer is to go xx and XY that's the
 
05:20:50.788 --> 05:20:50.798 align:start position:0%
only clear way to address the safety
 
05:20:53.150 --> 05:20:53.160 align:start position:0%
issue so uh thank you for the two
 
05:20:55.070 --> 05:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
minutes Mr chair I'll take a question if
 
05:20:56.750 --> 05:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
there are any thank you very much
 
05:20:59.548 --> 05:20:59.558 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee thank you
 
05:21:01.110 --> 05:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair you're welcome
 
05:21:01.120 --> 05:21:07.788 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair you're welcome
represent

05:21:07.788 --> 05:21:07.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:10.070 --> 05:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
n thank you and good afternoon Mr
 
05:21:12.350 --> 05:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
chairman and members of the committee um
 
05:21:14.868 --> 05:21:14.878 align:start position:0%
I'm representative Jenny n Hillsboro 21
 
05:21:17.910 --> 05:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
for the record I would have been the
 
05:21:19.788 --> 05:21:19.798 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of this bill but
 
05:21:21.670 --> 05:21:21.680 align:start position:0%
representative Andrew got her in before
 
05:21:24.750 --> 05:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
me so but I'm here today to um give my
 
05:21:27.150 --> 05:21:27.160 align:start position:0%
support for the bill and we've had this
 
05:21:29.910 --> 05:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
bill before of several times and uh
 
05:21:31.750 --> 05:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
representative Andress talked about
 
05:21:33.788 --> 05:21:33.798 align:start position:0%
greater weight height and weight there's
 
05:21:36.510 --> 05:21:36.520 align:start position:0%
also the heart the lungs lung capacity
 
05:21:39.110 --> 05:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
the hips um a biological mes hips are
 
05:21:40.628 --> 05:21:40.638 align:start position:0%
narrower so they have the advantage of
 
05:21:41.948 --> 05:21:41.958 align:start position:0%
running just kicking straight out
 
05:21:43.750 --> 05:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
whereas women we tend to be a little
 
05:21:45.750 --> 05:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
wider around the hips it kind of goes
 
05:21:48.830 --> 05:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
around um and also the world stage is
 
05:21:53.150 --> 05:21:53.160 align:start position:0%
taking notice to uh their policies that
 
05:21:56.548 --> 05:21:56.558 align:start position:0%
biological males do have an advantage um
 
05:21:58.510 --> 05:21:58.520 align:start position:0%
and to level the playing field they're
 
05:22:00.390 --> 05:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
they're starting to no longer allow them
 
05:22:03.030 --> 05:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
to compete with with women so as not to
 
05:22:04.830 --> 05:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
contribute to the Eraser of women and
 
05:22:07.190 --> 05:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
girls so I ask you to support the Bill
 
05:22:08.230 --> 05:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much
 
05:22:10.708 --> 05:22:10.718 align:start position:0%

committee members
 
05:22:35.150 --> 05:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
Title 9 came Title 9 came in law in 1972
 
05:22:37.230 --> 05:22:37.240 align:start position:0%
to give females an equal opportunity of
 
05:22:39.910 --> 05:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
sports it was not wildly accepted or
 
05:22:42.390 --> 05:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
executed everywhere I get involved in
 
05:22:44.948 --> 05:22:44.958 align:start position:0%
women's sports for this reason but being
 
05:22:46.910 --> 05:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
a father of three daughters I would not
 
05:22:49.350 --> 05:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
accept second class status of our local
 
05:22:51.868 --> 05:22:51.878 align:start position:0%
athletes uh that they were
 
05:22:54.150 --> 05:22:54.160 align:start position:0%
receiving I became involved in coaching
 
05:22:55.868 --> 05:22:55.878 align:start position:0%
and eventually running a league as a
 
05:22:59.390 --> 05:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
softball coach my team's won many state
 
05:23:01.270 --> 05:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
championships uh New England Regional
 
05:23:03.310 --> 05:23:03.320 align:start position:0%
championships even went to World Series
 
05:23:05.510 --> 05:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
I was lucky enough to have won five New
 
05:23:06.590 --> 05:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire High School state
 
05:23:08.430 --> 05:23:08.440 align:start position:0%
championships in
 
05:23:10.708 --> 05:23:10.718 align:start position:0%
softball my daughter was a pitcher went
 
05:23:13.070 --> 05:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
on a fine college career winning two
 
05:23:14.910 --> 05:23:14.920 align:start position:0%
conference championships and being named
 
05:23:16.948 --> 05:23:16.958 align:start position:0%
All-American she had an invitation to
 
05:23:19.070 --> 05:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
play with the US Olympic team in Europe
 
05:23:21.628 --> 05:23:21.638 align:start position:0%
and was recognized as Sports Illustrated
 
05:23:24.590 --> 05:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
that's not bad for a kid from rural ca
 
05:23:27.310 --> 05:23:27.320 align:start position:0%
County what this what do what does this
 
05:23:29.350 --> 05:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
have to do with HB
 
05:23:31.750 --> 05:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
125 with my exper experience I consider
 
05:23:34.110 --> 05:23:34.120 align:start position:0%
myself a softball expert in women's
 
05:23:35.830 --> 05:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
softball and I would not let my daughter
 
05:23:38.548 --> 05:23:38.558 align:start position:0%
play against biological males there's
 
05:23:40.190 --> 05:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
too much risk for physical harm never
 
05:23:41.470 --> 05:23:41.480 align:start position:0%
mind the emotional issues having to
 
05:23:44.070 --> 05:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
share a locker room with a biological
 
05:23:46.948 --> 05:23:46.958 align:start position:0%
man I've witnessed girls breaking legs
 
05:23:49.708 --> 05:23:49.718 align:start position:0%
arms jaw cheekbone playing against other
 
05:23:52.030 --> 05:23:52.040 align:start position:0%
women adding males only increase their
 
05:23:54.548 --> 05:23:54.558 align:start position:0%
injury rate to other females there are
 
05:23:56.990 --> 05:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
many recent cases where trans play trans
 
05:24:00.350 --> 05:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
players have H hospitalized female uh
 
05:24:02.150 --> 05:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
athletes this past November our
 
05:24:03.510 --> 05:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts high school field hockey
 
05:24:05.150 --> 05:24:05.160 align:start position:0%
player was hit in the face had teeth
 
05:24:07.910 --> 05:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
knocked out and hospitalized by a trans
 
05:24:10.110 --> 05:24:10.120 align:start position:0%
player also last month a high school
 
05:24:12.350 --> 05:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
volleyball player was hospitalized with
 
05:24:16.628 --> 05:24:16.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:19.230 --> 05:24:19.240 align:start position:0%
player now here's the heart of the
 
05:24:22.030 --> 05:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
bill at many Rural High Schools having
 
05:24:23.990 --> 05:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
enough members to feel the team can be
 
05:24:26.150 --> 05:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
challenging many Junior High kids are
 
05:24:28.310 --> 05:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
brought up to play Varsity my
 
05:24:30.150 --> 05:24:30.160 align:start position:0%
granddaughter is one of these cases
 
05:24:31.628 --> 05:24:31.638 align:start position:0%
she's an eighth grader and she is
 
05:24:34.590 --> 05:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
developing into an Elite softball player
 
05:24:36.430 --> 05:24:36.440 align:start position:0%
but to think this 13-year-old that
 
05:24:39.510 --> 05:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
stands 5'1 and was 100 lb could be
 
05:24:41.750 --> 05:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
standing on the mound 40t away facing an
 
05:24:46.230 --> 05:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
18-year-old 6'2 220 lb man is
 
05:24:49.030 --> 05:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
mortifying her mother will never let her
 
05:24:51.030 --> 05:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
her mother will never let her be put in
 
05:24:54.230 --> 05:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
a position to be severely injured your
 
05:24:56.628 --> 05:24:56.638 align:start position:0%
so time is up so wrap it up please one
 
05:24:59.390 --> 05:24:59.400 align:start position:0%
sentence yep so my granddaughter can't
 
05:25:00.990 --> 05:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
play because someone else refused is to
 
05:25:03.110 --> 05:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
play with physically equal players
 
05:25:05.070 --> 05:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
please protect our daughters if you
 
05:25:07.270 --> 05:25:07.280 align:start position:0%
cannot then just introduce legislation
 
05:25:10.510 --> 05:25:10.520 align:start position:0%
to revoke Title 9 that's in essence what
 
05:25:12.708 --> 05:25:12.718 align:start position:0%
is being done now thank you thank you

I'm here today in support of this bill
 
05:25:44.708 --> 05:25:44.718 align:start position:0%
and more importantly in support of
 
05:25:47.310 --> 05:25:47.320 align:start position:0%
fairness and women's sports uh I'm I'm a
 
05:25:50.708 --> 05:25:50.718 align:start position:0%
surfer I'm a surf coach uh and I mainly
 
05:25:55.270 --> 05:25:55.280 align:start position:0%
I only coach women and in my sport um
 
05:25:57.670 --> 05:25:57.680 align:start position:0%
women have had to work extremely hard to
 
05:26:00.150 --> 05:26:00.160 align:start position:0%
get to where they are in surfing for
 
05:26:00.160 --> 05:26:01.110 align:start position:0%
get to where they are in surfing for
example

05:26:01.110 --> 05:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
example
 
05:26:03.788 --> 05:26:03.798 align:start position:0%
on the pro level in surfing there's 50
 
05:26:06.470 --> 05:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
men on the CT circuit but there's 18
 
05:26:09.030 --> 05:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
women and if we don't take action to
 
05:26:11.270 --> 05:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
protect women's sports we could be
 
05:26:12.830 --> 05:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
taking a position away from a woman
 
05:26:14.948 --> 05:26:14.958 align:start position:0%
that's earned a spot in the future or a
 
05:26:17.030 --> 05:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
scholarship in their sport or all those
 
05:26:18.548 --> 05:26:18.558 align:start position:0%
other things that they work to and I and
 
05:26:22.788 --> 05:26:22.798 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to talk to that um issue
 
05:26:26.270 --> 05:26:26.280 align:start position:0%
because if we're giving spots to men in
 
05:26:28.548 --> 05:26:28.558 align:start position:0%
women's sports we're we're taking away
 
05:26:30.590 --> 05:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
from their chance to succeed and some
 
05:26:32.510 --> 05:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
some of those women have worked hard and
 
05:26:33.868 --> 05:26:33.878 align:start position:0%
have earned the chance to get those
 
05:26:35.948 --> 05:26:35.958 align:start position:0%
positions and they should have those
 
05:26:37.868 --> 05:26:37.878 align:start position:0%
positions thank you very much for your
 
05:26:39.788 --> 05:26:39.798 align:start position:0%
time thank you very much questions from
 
05:26:42.510 --> 05:26:42.520 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you very
 
05:26:51.510 --> 05:26:51.520 align:start position:0%

wood thank you Mr
 
05:26:56.350 --> 05:26:56.360 align:start position:0%

realize it was on I should know right um
 
05:27:07.430 --> 05:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
I'm also supporting this bill I wanted
 
05:27:10.230 --> 05:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
to bring a different aspect to this uh
 
05:27:12.110 --> 05:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
like some of the people who spoke
 
05:27:14.868 --> 05:27:14.878 align:start position:0%
earlier I hear a lot from the mothers
 
05:27:18.110 --> 05:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
the parents of of these uh children
 
05:27:21.868 --> 05:27:21.878 align:start position:0%
playing sports um they have all the
 
05:27:23.830 --> 05:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
general concerns of safety everything
 
05:27:25.830 --> 05:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
that was brought up one of the things
 
05:27:29.150 --> 05:27:29.160 align:start position:0%
that really bothered me was the uh
 
05:27:31.510 --> 05:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
environment that uh
 
05:27:34.430 --> 05:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
this is creating allowing uh this type
 
05:27:37.670 --> 05:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
of uh change in the in the sport uh they
 
05:27:40.310 --> 05:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
remind me of all the uh Medical Data out
 
05:27:42.150 --> 05:27:42.160 align:start position:0%
there they remind me how hard it was for
 
05:27:43.788 --> 05:27:43.798 align:start position:0%
women's sports to get
 
05:27:46.868 --> 05:27:46.878 align:start position:0%
started they know all the answers uh
 
05:27:48.670 --> 05:27:48.680 align:start position:0%
when I finally started asking them I
 
05:27:50.150 --> 05:27:50.160 align:start position:0%
said how come your daughter's still
 
05:27:52.750 --> 05:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
playing if it's so unfair we go always
 
05:27:56.150 --> 05:27:56.160 align:start position:0%
back the fairness of safety and um
 
05:28:00.270 --> 05:28:00.280 align:start position:0%
because it they're under stress not to
 
05:28:04.110 --> 05:28:04.120 align:start position:0%
um quit the sport there there's public
 
05:28:06.670 --> 05:28:06.680 align:start position:0%
pressure or peer pressure better word
 
05:28:09.548 --> 05:28:09.558 align:start position:0%
peer pressure for them to stay with it
 
05:28:13.110 --> 05:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
and um I started looking at incidents of
 
05:28:15.030 --> 05:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
people who have spoken out athletes have
 
05:28:17.350 --> 05:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
spoken out me there's plenty of evidence
 
05:28:21.470 --> 05:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
out there that um they're targets and um
 
05:28:23.390 --> 05:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
it's kind of concerning when I'm talking
 
05:28:25.350 --> 05:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
to parents who don't want their kids in
 
05:28:28.030 --> 05:28:28.040 align:start position:0%
there and the kids are fighting the play
 
05:28:29.590 --> 05:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh in here because they don't want to
 
05:28:31.910 --> 05:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
have that social stigma so I just want
 
05:28:34.190 --> 05:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
to add a A Different Twist to it and
 
05:28:35.788 --> 05:28:35.798 align:start position:0%
again this was from parents that have
 
05:28:37.590 --> 05:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
speaking out and like Jesse mentioned
 
05:28:39.750 --> 05:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
earlier representative mentioned early
 
05:28:41.590 --> 05:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of parents speaking out on
 
05:28:43.910 --> 05:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
this more than the uh women athletes I
 
05:28:46.590 --> 05:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
believe thank you thank you very much
 
05:28:48.350 --> 05:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
questions thank
 
05:28:57.590 --> 05:28:57.600 align:start position:0%

privilege of electing individuals to
 
05:29:20.628 --> 05:29:20.638 align:start position:0%
represent us and to legislate laws that
 
05:29:22.150 --> 05:29:22.160 align:start position:0%

05:29:26.510 --> 05:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
us that exact definition of our Republic
 
05:29:29.190 --> 05:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
we may not always agree with who was
 
05:29:31.350 --> 05:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
elected or what laws are pass but we are
 
05:29:35.190 --> 05:29:35.200 align:start position:0%

cannot provide 100% of equity meaning
 
05:29:51.070 --> 05:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
the quality of being fair and
 
05:29:55.910 --> 05:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
imparable for 100% of individuals 100%

situations where Equity must be provided
 
05:30:16.548 --> 05:30:16.558 align:start position:0%
for the majority I do understand if you
 
05:30:18.788 --> 05:30:18.798 align:start position:0%

I ask you to amend it but I implore you

Mr chair and thank you for hearing my
 
05:31:12.470 --> 05:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm representative sah orus
 
05:31:15.270 --> 05:31:15.280 align:start position:0%
from Chai Chester uh back in the day I
 
05:31:18.948 --> 05:31:18.958 align:start position:0%
used to be a FIFA referee for those of
 
05:31:20.708 --> 05:31:20.718 align:start position:0%
you that live in this country on this
 
05:31:22.750 --> 05:31:22.760 align:start position:0%
side of the pond it's called soccer on
 
05:31:24.590 --> 05:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
the other side of the pond that's called
 
05:31:27.430 --> 05:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
Football Federation of International
 
05:31:30.430 --> 05:31:30.440 align:start position:0%
Football Association and with that I
 
05:31:33.030 --> 05:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
just wanted to share that as a referee
 
05:31:35.190 --> 05:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
and a coach of several teams travel
 
05:31:38.350 --> 05:31:38.360 align:start position:0%
teams home teams that sort of thing uh I
 
05:31:41.628 --> 05:31:41.638 align:start position:0%
have seen the disparity in physical
 
05:31:43.708 --> 05:31:43.718 align:start position:0%
ability between men and women if you
 
05:31:47.948 --> 05:31:47.958 align:start position:0%
will and my daughter was permanently
 
05:31:51.110 --> 05:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
injured her right eye by a biological
 
05:31:54.110 --> 05:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
male when uh she was taken down and
 
05:31:57.030 --> 05:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
kicked accidentally I'm sure but my
 
05:31:59.628 --> 05:31:59.638 align:start position:0%
point is being a referee and being a
 
05:32:02.708 --> 05:32:02.718 align:start position:0%
coach over the years I have seen this
 
05:32:06.190 --> 05:32:06.200 align:start position:0%
disparity of size and strength and I
 
05:32:08.948 --> 05:32:08.958 align:start position:0%
would wish you would consider that as as
 
05:32:11.030 --> 05:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
you go forward thank you very much thank

Reed hi thank you so much for taking the
 
05:32:45.350 --> 05:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
time to hear my testimony uh for the
 
05:32:47.510 --> 05:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
record my name is Courtney Reid and I
 
05:32:49.868 --> 05:32:49.878 align:start position:0%
serve as policy Advocate with the ACLU
 
05:32:52.830 --> 05:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and I wanted to speak
 
05:32:56.510 --> 05:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
in opposition to this bill as it raises
 
05:32:59.430 --> 05:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
serious concerns uh of constitutional
 
05:33:01.430 --> 05:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
concerns and would allow for
 
05:33:04.350 --> 05:33:04.360 align:start position:0%
discrimination based on sex in New
 
05:33:07.590 --> 05:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um one of the representatives
 
05:33:09.150 --> 05:33:09.160 align:start position:0%
have brought up Title
 
05:33:12.990 --> 05:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
9 uh this bill would violate federal law
 
05:33:15.350 --> 05:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
it would violate Title Nine of the Civil
 
05:33:19.670 --> 05:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
Rights Act which has a a clear uh
 
05:33:22.430 --> 05:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
requirement that in schools receiving
 
05:33:25.590 --> 05:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
Federal funding educational programs
 
05:33:28.030 --> 05:33:28.040 align:start position:0%
cannot discriminate on the basis of sex
 
05:33:29.708 --> 05:33:29.718 align:start position:0%
and that's exactly what this bill would
 
05:33:29.718 --> 05:33:30.548 align:start position:0%
and that's exactly what this bill would
do

05:33:30.548 --> 05:33:30.558 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:33:34.948 --> 05:33:34.958 align:start position:0%
and that it categorically would prohibit
 
05:33:37.708 --> 05:33:37.718 align:start position:0%
transgender women and intersect people
 
05:33:41.150 --> 05:33:41.160 align:start position:0%
from participating in sports teams or in
 
05:33:43.510 --> 05:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
any team uh I think the the bill
 
05:33:46.708 --> 05:33:46.718 align:start position:0%
references requiring competitive
 
05:33:46.718 --> 05:33:48.948 align:start position:0%
references requiring competitive
skill

05:33:48.948 --> 05:33:48.958 align:start position:0%
skill
 
05:33:51.830 --> 05:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
um bills like this have been brought to
 
05:33:55.470 --> 05:33:55.480 align:start position:0%
the courts and numerous occasions and
 
05:33:58.628 --> 05:33:58.638 align:start position:0%
the ninth Circuit of appeals has ruled
 
05:34:00.310 --> 05:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
in line with this argument that
 
05:34:02.470 --> 05:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
legislation like this is
 
05:34:04.670 --> 05:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
discriminatory and
 
05:34:07.310 --> 05:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and that violates Title
 
05:34:11.110 --> 05:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
9 UM and there have been numerous amus
 
05:34:13.788 --> 05:34:13.798 align:start position:0%
briefs coming from women's rights
 
05:34:16.788 --> 05:34:16.798 align:start position:0%
organizations um from athlet Athletics
 
05:34:18.910 --> 05:34:18.920 align:start position:0%
organizations medical experts and
 
05:34:22.310 --> 05:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
coaches all arguing for transgender
 
05:34:25.430 --> 05:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
equality and against these policies um
 
05:34:27.990 --> 05:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to highlight with that that
 
05:34:30.390 --> 05:34:30.400 align:start position:0%
when this legislation was introduced
 
05:34:32.788 --> 05:34:32.798 align:start position:0%
and heard by the committee I think only
 
05:34:34.230 --> 05:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
three or four years ago it was
 
05:34:37.070 --> 05:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
unanimously voted down and so I would
 
05:34:40.150 --> 05:34:40.160 align:start position:0%
hope that um looking at
 
05:34:42.590 --> 05:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
the Discrimination that this bill would
 
05:34:44.510 --> 05:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
allow that the committee would vote
 
05:34:46.670 --> 05:34:46.680 align:start position:0%
align with it again and then just
 
05:34:50.430 --> 05:34:50.440 align:start position:0%
speaking in terms of fairness and safety
 
05:34:52.350 --> 05:34:52.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of these claims are
 
05:34:55.270 --> 05:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
unsubstantiated if you look at records
 
05:34:59.470 --> 05:34:59.480 align:start position:0%
for competitions there is no categorical
 
05:35:02.750 --> 05:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
area where trans athletes have
 
05:35:07.670 --> 05:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
continuously um won or have robbed uh
 
05:35:11.230 --> 05:35:11.240 align:start position:0%
other athletes from Awards can you
 
05:35:13.590 --> 05:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
please wrap it up for done the time yeah
 
05:35:15.070 --> 05:35:15.080 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm open to taking questions
 
05:35:16.910 --> 05:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
from the commit much are there questions
 
05:35:18.070 --> 05:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
from the committee yes represent
 
05:35:21.670 --> 05:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
cordelli uh thank you um so referencing
 
05:35:25.350 --> 05:35:25.360 align:start position:0%
Title Nine is there a definition of sex
 
05:35:26.910 --> 05:35:26.920 align:start position:0%
in Title
 
05:35:30.590 --> 05:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
9 UM my understanding of title TI 9 is
 
05:35:33.628 --> 05:35:33.638 align:start position:0%
that it has been interpreted by uh the
 
05:35:36.990 --> 05:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to apply
 
05:35:40.868 --> 05:35:40.878 align:start position:0%
to transgender people um that the sex
 
05:35:42.910 --> 05:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
applies to transgender people in terms
 
05:35:44.670 --> 05:35:44.680 align:start position:0%
of protecting them from discrimination
 
05:35:46.868 --> 05:35:46.878 align:start position:0%
and the courts have interpreted it in
 
05:35:46.878 --> 05:35:47.868 align:start position:0%
and the courts have interpreted it in
that

05:35:47.868 --> 05:35:47.878 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:35:51.628 --> 05:35:51.638 align:start position:0%
way yeah um you also mentioned a ninth
 
05:35:54.948 --> 05:35:54.958 align:start position:0%
circuit ruling um of discrimination
 
05:35:58.190 --> 05:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
could you supply us with that um ruling
 
05:36:00.868 --> 05:36:00.878 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to email the the briefs to
 
05:36:02.830 --> 05:36:02.840 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you thank you
 
05:36:05.070 --> 05:36:05.080 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee see
 
05:36:07.990 --> 05:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much oh oh represent Bel
 
05:36:10.230 --> 05:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
I didn't see you thank you Mr chair
 
05:36:11.590 --> 05:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony I also
 
05:36:12.990 --> 05:36:13.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to follow up on the on the
 
05:36:14.590 --> 05:36:14.600 align:start position:0%
concept of Title Nine and and the
 
05:36:17.310 --> 05:36:17.320 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court um you said that so title
 
05:36:18.750 --> 05:36:18.760 align:start position:0%
N9 is is obviously it's part of the
 
05:36:21.070 --> 05:36:21.080 align:start position:0%
Civil Rights Act Civil Rights Act has
 
05:36:24.510 --> 05:36:24.520 align:start position:0%
been in place for very very many
 
05:36:27.910 --> 05:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
decades so how come this is only just
 
05:36:30.070 --> 05:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
recently within the last several years
 
05:36:33.750 --> 05:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
years been seen as protecting cross um
 
05:36:36.270 --> 05:36:36.280 align:start position:0%
cross biological sex within
 
05:36:38.990 --> 05:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
Sports thank you representative for your
 
05:36:42.430 --> 05:36:42.440 align:start position:0%
question um I think a lot of these
 
05:36:44.628 --> 05:36:44.638 align:start position:0%
things have come up because we're seeing
 
05:36:47.390 --> 05:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
more and more hostile laws against
 
05:36:50.110 --> 05:36:50.120 align:start position:0%
transgender people trying to access
 
05:36:52.788 --> 05:36:52.798 align:start position:0%
spaces equally in ways that we haven't
 
05:36:56.830 --> 05:36:56.840 align:start position:0%
before um the ninth circuit decision I
 
05:36:59.990 --> 05:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
had referenced comes out of a similar
 
05:37:02.270 --> 05:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
prohibition on participation in sports
 
05:37:04.830 --> 05:37:04.840 align:start position:0%
for transgender women out of
 
05:37:04.840 --> 05:37:06.868 align:start position:0%
for transgender women out of
Idaho

05:37:06.868 --> 05:37:06.878 align:start position:0%
Idaho
 
05:37:09.470 --> 05:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
um I
 
05:37:13.548 --> 05:37:13.558 align:start position:0%
think a lot of these things have come up
 
05:37:16.230 --> 05:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
because there's a lot of hostility that
 
05:37:18.628 --> 05:37:18.638 align:start position:0%
has to be has to be challenged and I had
 
05:37:20.788 --> 05:37:20.798 align:start position:0%
another point I wanted to make about
 
05:37:23.310 --> 05:37:23.320 align:start position:0%
that but I am losing track of it so I I
 
05:37:24.830 --> 05:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
will reach out to you after the hearing
 
05:37:27.948 --> 05:37:27.958 align:start position:0%
thank you so much further questions if I
 
05:37:29.628 --> 05:37:29.638 align:start position:0%
may just a further clarify on that point
 
05:37:32.270 --> 05:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
point if if it's only just so recently
 
05:37:35.750 --> 05:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
that all these laws are causing this to
 
05:37:39.030 --> 05:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
be brought to the various courts and
 
05:37:41.190 --> 05:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
it's only recently that this sort of
 
05:37:44.670 --> 05:37:44.680 align:start position:0%
spirit has become upon us
 
05:37:48.430 --> 05:37:48.440 align:start position:0%
um why were sex segregated Sports the
 
05:37:52.310 --> 05:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:54.628 --> 05:37:54.638 align:start position:0%
recently thank you for your question I
 
05:37:57.628 --> 05:37:57.638 align:start position:0%
think you do highlight an important
 
05:38:01.190 --> 05:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
thing that we need to work on as a
 
05:38:03.628 --> 05:38:03.638 align:start position:0%
society which is the inclusion and
 
05:38:05.788 --> 05:38:05.798 align:start position:0%
thoughtfulness of interex and
 
05:38:08.590 --> 05:38:08.600 align:start position:0%
transgender people as it relates to
 
05:38:12.868 --> 05:38:12.878 align:start position:0%
Athletics but um trans people have been
 
05:38:15.190 --> 05:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
participating in sports for many years
 
05:38:18.310 --> 05:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
and uh I wanted to note that I
 
05:38:21.628 --> 05:38:21.638 align:start position:0%
think as far back as 2004 the Olympics
 
05:38:24.788 --> 05:38:24.798 align:start position:0%
have had a policy and have had uh trans
 
05:38:27.030 --> 05:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
athletes competing in sports and you can
 
05:38:29.868 --> 05:38:29.878 align:start position:0%
date back a lot of policy and guidelines
 
05:38:33.990 --> 05:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
like NCAA guidelines about what it means
 
05:38:36.868 --> 05:38:36.878 align:start position:0%
to have uh competitive advantage and
 
05:38:39.990 --> 05:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
fairness when it comes to to trans
 
05:38:41.430 --> 05:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
participation and I don't think that
 
05:38:45.110 --> 05:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
it's the place of the state to impose
 
05:38:49.070 --> 05:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
this policing of of athletes in in the
 
05:38:50.948 --> 05:38:50.958 align:start position:0%
form of this bill I think it's very
 
05:38:54.990 --> 05:38:55.000 align:start position:0%
harmful and in the way that it works you
 
05:38:58.830 --> 05:38:58.840 align:start position:0%
know uh looking at the like way in which
 
05:39:00.548 --> 05:39:00.558 align:start position:0%
it's controlled through birth
 
05:39:03.708 --> 05:39:03.718 align:start position:0%
certificate does this mean that any
 
05:39:06.788 --> 05:39:06.798 align:start position:0%
masculine looking girl might be subject
 
05:39:08.830 --> 05:39:08.840 align:start position:0%
to some sort of policing or might have
 
05:39:11.190 --> 05:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
to provide her birth certificate for
 
05:39:13.590 --> 05:39:13.600 align:start position:0%
investigation whereas uh you know
 
05:39:14.868 --> 05:39:14.878 align:start position:0%
someone who looks more petite and
 
05:39:16.230 --> 05:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
feminine what
 
05:39:18.990 --> 05:39:19.000 align:start position:0%
not um you know I would like to see
 
05:39:22.270 --> 05:39:22.280 align:start position:0%
these alleged records of danger and
 
05:39:24.468 --> 05:39:24.478 align:start position:0%
violence in sports because as far as I
 
05:39:27.750 --> 05:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
know I there is no substantiated account
 
05:39:30.830 --> 05:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
of that happening thank you are there
 
05:39:32.750 --> 05:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee thank
 
05:39:48.990 --> 05:39:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:51.670 --> 05:39:51.680 align:start position:0%

I'm also been an educator in New
 
05:40:03.310 --> 05:40:03.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for the last 25 years I'm
 
05:40:05.390 --> 05:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
currently District chair of the SAU 39
 
05:40:06.830 --> 05:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
school board and a mom of three
 
05:40:08.948 --> 05:40:08.958 align:start position:0%
daughters and I have appreciated the
 
05:40:12.390 --> 05:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
1972 Title 9 education amendments which
 
05:40:13.868 --> 05:40:13.878 align:start position:0%
protected the rights and opportunities
 
05:40:15.590 --> 05:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
of female students in educational
 
05:40:17.590 --> 05:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
settings it was about Equity of
 
05:40:19.548 --> 05:40:19.558 align:start position:0%
opportunity it was about safety and
 
05:40:22.468 --> 05:40:22.478 align:start position:0%
wellness in 1972 everyone knew what this
 
05:40:24.548 --> 05:40:24.558 align:start position:0%
meant that males were dominating the
 
05:40:27.070 --> 05:40:27.080 align:start position:0%
playing field not just in sports and
 
05:40:30.110 --> 05:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
that protection was warranted in recent
 
05:40:31.948 --> 05:40:31.958 align:start position:0%
years this has become muddy we find
 
05:40:34.070 --> 05:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
ourselves as a society undergoing mental
 
05:40:36.948 --> 05:40:36.958 align:start position:0%
gymnastics attempting to define a woman
 
05:40:38.750 --> 05:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
even the National Organization of Women
 
05:40:40.948 --> 05:40:40.958 align:start position:0%
long a defender of women's rights has
 
05:40:43.708 --> 05:40:43.718 align:start position:0%
left its original purpose of protection
 
05:40:45.430 --> 05:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
from the website of the women's sports
 
05:40:47.590 --> 05:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
Foundation the women's sports Foundation
 
05:40:49.670 --> 05:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
supports the rights of all athletes
 
05:40:51.948 --> 05:40:51.958 align:start position:0%
including transgender athletes to
 
05:40:53.948 --> 05:40:53.958 align:start position:0%
participate in an athletic competition
 
05:40:56.590 --> 05:40:56.600 align:start position:0%
that is fair Equitable and respectful to
 
05:40:59.310 --> 05:40:59.320 align:start position:0%
all on the surface this is a reasonable
 
05:41:01.270 --> 05:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
position and I am in no way advocating
 
05:41:03.270 --> 05:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
that we ignore the natural rights of any
 
05:41:06.150 --> 05:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
group of students however in a misguided
 
05:41:07.430 --> 05:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
attempt to show respect to a
 
05:41:09.230 --> 05:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
marginalized segment of the educational
 
05:41:11.868 --> 05:41:11.878 align:start position:0%
population our women's sports programs
 
05:41:14.468 --> 05:41:14.478 align:start position:0%
are rapidly becoming unfair to women
 
05:41:16.548 --> 05:41:16.558 align:start position:0%
dismantling the equity of opportunity
 
05:41:18.708 --> 05:41:18.718 align:start position:0%
and respect intended by the authors of
 
05:41:21.948 --> 05:41:21.958 align:start position:0%
the 1972 Title 9 Amendments of even
 
05:41:23.868 --> 05:41:23.878 align:start position:0%
greater concern is the safety threat
 
05:41:25.910 --> 05:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
posed to Young athletes who are now
 
05:41:27.390 --> 05:41:27.400 align:start position:0%
competing against athletes with a
 
05:41:29.948 --> 05:41:29.958 align:start position:0%
natural biological advantage increasing
 
05:41:32.150 --> 05:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
the potential for serious injury and
 
05:41:34.190 --> 05:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
being required to share changing areas
 
05:41:36.750 --> 05:41:36.760 align:start position:0%
with non-female athletes removing the
 
05:41:38.510 --> 05:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
rights and opportunities entitled to
 
05:41:40.430 --> 05:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
young women and jeopardizing their
 
05:41:42.510 --> 05:41:42.520 align:start position:0%
safety and comfort in women's sports
 
05:41:44.670 --> 05:41:44.680 align:start position:0%
does not achieve equity and I urge your
 
05:41:47.390 --> 05:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
support of House Bill 1205 thank you
 
05:41:48.670 --> 05:41:48.680 align:start position:0%
very much are there any questions from
 
05:41:48.680 --> 05:41:49.468 align:start position:0%

05:42:02.350 --> 05:42:02.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:04.910 --> 05:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
you may be familiar with this book well
 
05:42:08.150 --> 05:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
would you please sit down
 
05:42:10.110 --> 05:42:10.120 align:start position:0%
yes excuse
 
05:42:13.990 --> 05:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
me um thank you um The Honorable Betty
 
05:42:16.628 --> 05:42:16.638 align:start position:0%
gay I spent six years here and hope to
 
05:42:19.270 --> 05:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
come back the reason that I'm here thank
 
05:42:22.030 --> 05:42:22.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:42:25.468 --> 05:42:25.478 align:start position:0%
testimony as a person who is not against
 
05:42:28.468 --> 05:42:28.478 align:start position:0%
trans people and I highly recommend this
 
05:42:32.070 --> 05:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
book which my chiropractor told me about
 
05:42:34.990 --> 05:42:35.000 align:start position:0%
oh it's a family it's a family from New
 
05:42:38.788 --> 05:42:38.798 align:start position:0%
England and they adopted twin boys and
 
05:42:41.150 --> 05:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
as one of the CH as the children learned
 
05:42:44.030 --> 05:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
to talk that's how young they were one
 
05:42:47.390 --> 05:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
of them insisted he was a girl and he
 
05:42:50.670 --> 05:42:50.680 align:start position:0%
was very unhappy to be a boy and this is
 
05:42:53.230 --> 05:42:53.240 align:start position:0%
their story their struggle of that was
 
05:42:55.670 --> 05:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
very painful but luckily has a pretty
 
05:42:58.788 --> 05:42:58.798 align:start position:0%
good ending so I just want to say I'm
 
05:43:01.310 --> 05:43:01.320 align:start position:0%
not anti-trends and I don't like any
 
05:43:03.830 --> 05:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
kind of prejudice against anybody but
 
05:43:06.830 --> 05:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
the reason I'm here supporting this bill
 
05:43:10.430 --> 05:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
is that the best male athletes will
 
05:43:13.990 --> 05:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
always beat the best women athletes and
 
05:43:16.350 --> 05:43:16.360 align:start position:0%
it's only fair to keep a Level Playing
 
05:43:18.990 --> 05:43:19.000 align:start position:0%
Field if Caitlyn Jenner who's one of the
 
05:43:22.030 --> 05:43:22.040 align:start position:0%
most famous trans people trans athletes
 
05:43:25.070 --> 05:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
although she doesn't compete now but she
 
05:43:28.670 --> 05:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
says it's not fair and so I think we
 
05:43:33.310 --> 05:43:33.320 align:start position:0%
need to pass a law that protects girls
 
05:43:36.830 --> 05:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
and young women and women in competition
 
05:43:39.990 --> 05:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
so that trans athletes can compete
 
05:43:43.468 --> 05:43:43.478 align:start position:0%
against trans athletes and not against
 
05:43:45.150 --> 05:43:45.160 align:start position:0%
girls and
 
05:43:47.670 --> 05:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
women thank you very much and welcome
 
05:43:49.510 --> 05:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
back thank you uh are there any
 
05:43:51.990 --> 05:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee thank you
 
05:43:57.990 --> 05:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:58.000 --> 05:44:02.070 align:start position:0%
 
Briggs

05:44:02.070 --> 05:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:04.430 --> 05:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
hi and thank you for all your
 
05:44:08.510 --> 05:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
contributions of your time to be here um
 
05:44:11.990 --> 05:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
my other half and I um she's
 
05:44:17.190 --> 05:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
by and uh so is much of my family and we
 
05:44:20.548 --> 05:44:20.558 align:start position:0%
up until recently we used to go out to
 
05:44:25.030 --> 05:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
all the bars the G bars uh I don't know
 
05:44:26.990 --> 05:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
how what the term might be but anyway we
 
05:44:30.548 --> 05:44:30.558 align:start position:0%
go to 313 the the Breezeway they're
 
05:44:33.590 --> 05:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
wonderful folks wonderful and we both
 
05:44:36.830 --> 05:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
agree on that and uh in any event we
 
05:44:40.468 --> 05:44:40.478 align:start position:0%
really supported the LGBT community
 
05:44:42.990 --> 05:44:43.000 align:start position:0%
until recently where you know they're
 
05:44:45.910 --> 05:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
starting to uh advocating and a small
 
05:44:48.190 --> 05:44:48.200 align:start position:0%
minority of course advocating for
 
05:44:52.190 --> 05:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
butchering of kids under 18 and Men
 
05:44:57.190 --> 05:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
reading stories to uh kids on their laps
 
05:44:59.190 --> 05:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
well there's only one reason that for
 
05:45:04.070 --> 05:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
doing that um and um schools making kids
 
05:45:09.910 --> 05:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
question who they are um it's Dei divide
 
05:45:13.350 --> 05:45:13.360 align:start position:0%
uh exclude and indoctrinate is is what's
 
05:45:15.548 --> 05:45:15.558 align:start position:0%
happening these days and it's very sad
 
05:45:17.708 --> 05:45:17.718 align:start position:0%
because the community as a whole is is
 
05:45:20.270 --> 05:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
is really wonderful but it's it's
 
05:45:21.948 --> 05:45:21.958 align:start position:0%
swinging this way and I think it's a
 
05:45:25.868 --> 05:45:25.878 align:start position:0%
problem and most notably for men
 
05:45:27.628 --> 05:45:27.638 align:start position:0%
destroying women's sports I don't care
 
05:45:29.750 --> 05:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
what you call yourself still a
 
05:45:33.110 --> 05:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
biological man with all the
 
05:45:36.990 --> 05:45:37.000 align:start position:0%
advantages um and it's impacting women's
 
05:45:39.548 --> 05:45:39.558 align:start position:0%
sports there's possibility for
 
05:45:42.310 --> 05:45:42.320 align:start position:0%
scholarships to go to school woman loses
 
05:45:44.030 --> 05:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
her right to go to school because she
 
05:45:46.830 --> 05:45:46.840 align:start position:0%
can't get that scholarship that a guy's
 
05:45:50.310 --> 05:45:50.320 align:start position:0%
GNA get who was Woman of the Year Dylan
 
05:45:53.030 --> 05:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
what's his name mlan or whatever woman
 
05:45:55.350 --> 05:45:55.360 align:start position:0%
of the year I mean come on this is
 
05:45:59.030 --> 05:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
science we're talking about um I I can't
 
05:46:02.070 --> 05:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
even believe that we're using all of
 
05:46:04.948 --> 05:46:04.958 align:start position:0%
your valuable time to even discuss this
 
05:46:08.350 --> 05:46:08.360 align:start position:0%
it's just a no-brainer with with science
 
05:46:13.110 --> 05:46:13.120 align:start position:0%
um there's um it also um we're talking
 
05:46:17.910 --> 05:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
about uh girls and women's privacy uh if
 
05:46:21.190 --> 05:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
I had a a girl in sports and there's a
 
05:46:24.788 --> 05:46:24.798 align:start position:0%
guy in there um I'm sorry we'd have a
 
05:46:27.110 --> 05:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
serious problem okay wrap it up you're
 
05:46:29.990 --> 05:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
going to be on your too okay U um and
 
05:46:31.510 --> 05:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
women are getting physically hurt we
 
05:46:35.230 --> 05:46:35.240 align:start position:0%
know that and also uh this would stop
 
05:46:38.070 --> 05:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
women or girls who want to go in a sport
 
05:46:39.830 --> 05:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
from participating because of their
 
05:46:42.510 --> 05:46:42.520 align:start position:0%
parents or because they're afraid to
 
05:46:45.310 --> 05:46:45.320 align:start position:0%
step up and do that because of this
 
05:46:47.310 --> 05:46:47.320 align:start position:0%
women's records are destroyed the
 
05:46:49.310 --> 05:46:49.320 align:start position:0%
Olympics is now I don't watch the
 
05:46:51.190 --> 05:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
Olympics anymore because of compromising
 
05:46:53.110 --> 05:46:53.120 align:start position:0%
that and women's sports I don't do it
 
05:46:55.270 --> 05:46:55.280 align:start position:0%

from the committee thank you very much
 
05:47:20.110 --> 05:47:20.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:23.990 --> 05:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
brard Nancy Brennan from where she
 
05:47:27.190 --> 05:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
her there's a new documentary called
 
05:47:29.670 --> 05:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
will and Harper it's about the
 
05:47:32.350 --> 05:47:32.360 align:start position:0%
friendship between actor Will frell and
 
05:47:35.150 --> 05:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
writer Harper steel they go on a
 
05:47:38.230 --> 05:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
CrossCountry road trip to explore her
 
05:47:41.670 --> 05:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
new identity as a transgender woman
 
05:47:45.390 --> 05:47:45.400 align:start position:0%
friends since they met on SNL frell
 
05:47:48.590 --> 05:47:48.600 align:start position:0%
calls the trip a chance to transition
 
05:47:52.190 --> 05:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
myself in a way to learn to get to know
 
05:47:54.310 --> 05:47:54.320 align:start position:0%
my friend even more than I knew her
 
05:47:56.910 --> 05:47:56.920 align:start position:0%
before to get to ask these questions
 
05:48:00.110 --> 05:48:00.120 align:start position:0%
that I think a lot of sis people still
 
05:48:03.468 --> 05:48:03.478 align:start position:0%
have the comments I've read in favor of
 
05:48:07.230 --> 05:48:07.240 align:start position:0%
this bill calling transgender girls and
 
05:48:11.910 --> 05:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
women boys and men are ignorant and
 
05:48:15.070 --> 05:48:15.080 align:start position:0%
cruel they buy into the scare tactics
 
05:48:18.150 --> 05:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
and stereotypes that further marginalize
 
05:48:21.390 --> 05:48:21.400 align:start position:0%
an already vulnerable population here's
 
05:48:23.190 --> 05:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
the thing about kids in sports I don't
 
05:48:24.548 --> 05:48:24.558 align:start position:0%
know if you've ever seen any of the
 
05:48:26.990 --> 05:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
surveys that they do but when they ask
 
05:48:28.948 --> 05:48:28.958 align:start position:0%
the parents what's the most important
 
05:48:31.510 --> 05:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
thing the parents say winning when they
 
05:48:33.948 --> 05:48:33.958 align:start position:0%
ask the kids they say hanging out with
 
05:48:37.390 --> 05:48:37.400 align:start position:0%
my friends there's a difference and
 
05:48:39.868 --> 05:48:39.878 align:start position:0%
sports at this level are supposed to be
 
05:48:42.948 --> 05:48:42.958 align:start position:0%
fun inclusive a chance to build skills
 
05:48:45.670 --> 05:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
and friendships when kids aren't allowed
 
05:48:48.868 --> 05:48:48.878 align:start position:0%
to play it hurts and for a transgender
 
05:48:51.788 --> 05:48:51.798 align:start position:0%
kid it can be devastating in terms of
 
05:48:55.628 --> 05:48:55.638 align:start position:0%
who expels it excels at sports there are
 
05:48:58.990 --> 05:48:59.000 align:start position:0%
many variables some kids are natural
 
05:49:02.390 --> 05:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
taller faster more coordinated there is
 
05:49:05.708 --> 05:49:05.718 align:start position:0%
also an element of opportunity and
 
05:49:08.548 --> 05:49:08.558 align:start position:0%
privilege for the kid who has a private
 
05:49:11.270 --> 05:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
coach or whose parents can afford the
 
05:49:16.468 --> 05:49:16.478 align:start position:0%
exclusive Sports Camps Dr Eric vain a

many years says there are no good faith
 
05:49:28.708 --> 05:49:28.718 align:start position:0%
reasons to limit transgender women's

movie that is so sweet and funny so

generous and gentle about your time is
 
05:49:44.390 --> 05:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
up explaining
 
05:49:48.030 --> 05:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
transness that it should go across the
 
05:49:50.830 --> 05:49:50.840 align:start position:0%
country and teach people but you know
 
05:49:53.030 --> 05:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
what we shouldn't have to have a child
 
05:49:55.990 --> 05:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
or a best friend who is transgender to
 
05:49:58.670 --> 05:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
have empathy and fight for in
 
05:50:01.270 --> 05:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
inclusiveness Being Human should be
 
05:50:04.190 --> 05:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
enough please it are there questions
 
05:50:20.910 --> 05:50:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:24.390 --> 05:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
scare welcome thank you good afternoon
 
05:50:27.430 --> 05:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
chairman lad and honorable committee
 
05:50:29.468 --> 05:50:29.478 align:start position:0%
members I've got a little bit of a
 
05:50:31.590 --> 05:50:31.600 align:start position:0%
different concern and it's
 
05:50:34.548 --> 05:50:34.558 align:start position:0%
transgenderism is a religious idea in
 
05:50:37.070 --> 05:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
that it teaches that we are born with
 
05:50:39.788 --> 05:50:39.798 align:start position:0%
these mutable gendered souls or gendered
 
05:50:42.270 --> 05:50:42.280 align:start position:0%
identities and these gender identities
 
05:50:44.708 --> 05:50:44.718 align:start position:0%
are our authentic selves not our bodies
 
05:50:47.150 --> 05:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
they're less important than our bodies
 
05:50:49.190 --> 05:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
but the safety issues that we've talked
 
05:50:51.590 --> 05:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
about here today and fairness issues the
 
05:50:54.030 --> 05:50:54.040 align:start position:0%
problem is that bodies compete not
 
05:50:54.040 --> 05:50:55.868 align:start position:0%
problem is that bodies compete not
gender

05:50:55.868 --> 05:50:55.878 align:start position:0%
gender
 
05:50:58.628 --> 05:50:58.638 align:start position:0%
identities our current policies right
 
05:51:00.670 --> 05:51:00.680 align:start position:0%
now are teaching young women that
 
05:51:03.190 --> 05:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
they're second class citizens whose
 
05:51:06.430 --> 05:51:06.440 align:start position:0%
needs are subordinate to male needs and
 
05:51:09.468 --> 05:51:09.478 align:start position:0%
desires and it's wrong for the state to
 
05:51:12.948 --> 05:51:12.958 align:start position:0%
use the force of laws to coer them to
 
05:51:15.430 --> 05:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
sacrifice their rights to fairness
 
05:51:18.788 --> 05:51:18.798 align:start position:0%
safety boundaries to validate men's
 
05:51:18.798 --> 05:51:20.070 align:start position:0%
safety boundaries to validate men's
gender

05:51:20.070 --> 05:51:20.080 align:start position:0%
gender
 
05:51:22.628 --> 05:51:22.638 align:start position:0%
identities now I often hear that most
 
05:51:24.670 --> 05:51:24.680 align:start position:0%
girls are happy to compete against boys
 
05:51:27.670 --> 05:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
and even if that's true the majority of
 
05:51:30.150 --> 05:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
girls can't can't give away the other
 
05:51:33.430 --> 05:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
girls individual rights to safety and
 
05:51:35.990 --> 05:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
privacy moreover any girl that speaks
 
05:51:37.948 --> 05:51:37.958 align:start position:0%
out of this about this and has spoken
 
05:51:40.670 --> 05:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
out about it gets ostracized and accused
 
05:51:40.680 --> 05:51:41.788 align:start position:0%
out about it gets ostracized and accused
of

05:51:41.788 --> 05:51:41.798 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:51:44.430 --> 05:51:44.440 align:start position:0%
transphobia and one last thought if we
 
05:51:46.468 --> 05:51:46.478 align:start position:0%
wait until a girl from New Hampshire
 
05:51:48.390 --> 05:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
gets her teeth knocked out to address
 
05:51:51.190 --> 05:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
this then we failed because we didn't
 
05:51:53.430 --> 05:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
protect her so thank you thank you very
 
05:51:54.948 --> 05:51:54.958 align:start position:0%
much are there any questions from the
 
05:51:57.270 --> 05:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
committee not see you thank you very
 
05:52:09.468 --> 05:52:09.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:09.478 --> 05:52:15.510 align:start position:0%

05:52:17.990 --> 05:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
welcome my name is Lind Jake house I
 
05:52:20.468 --> 05:52:20.478 align:start position:0%
live in do and I am a co-founder of 603
 
05:52:22.468 --> 05:52:22.478 align:start position:0%
equality a community group dedicated to
 
05:52:24.910 --> 05:52:24.920 align:start position:0%
creating a Granite State where all lgbtq
 
05:52:26.910 --> 05:52:26.920 align:start position:0%
people can Thrive I'd like to read
 
05:52:28.830 --> 05:52:28.840 align:start position:0%
excerpts from testimony provided by a
 
05:52:30.468 --> 05:52:30.478 align:start position:0%
few people who could not be here today
 
05:52:32.350 --> 05:52:32.360 align:start position:0%
and wrap up by adding a few of my own
 
05:52:34.670 --> 05:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
thoughts but first I am here to say
 
05:52:37.190 --> 05:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
unequivocally transg girls or girls
 
05:52:40.190 --> 05:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
trans women or women biological boys and
 
05:52:42.150 --> 05:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
men are not competing on girls and
 
05:52:44.628 --> 05:52:44.638 align:start position:0%
women's teams furthermore the suggestion
 
05:52:46.390 --> 05:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
that trans girls and women pose a danger
 
05:52:48.230 --> 05:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
to the safety of other girls and women
 
05:52:49.990 --> 05:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
is dangerous to the health and safety of
 
05:52:52.030 --> 05:52:52.040 align:start position:0%
transgender girls and I would urge the
 
05:52:54.468 --> 05:52:54.478 align:start position:0%
chair to ask any future testifier who
 
05:52:56.070 --> 05:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
suggests that trans people are dangerous
 
05:52:58.430 --> 05:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
to avoid those comments moving forward
 
05:52:59.948 --> 05:52:59.958 align:start position:0%
those of you on this committee have
 
05:53:01.670 --> 05:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
likely heard previously from Lane
 
05:53:03.750 --> 05:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
Jocelyn a now 19-year-old transgender
 
05:53:05.750 --> 05:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
woman who played High School soccer with
 
05:53:08.110 --> 05:53:08.120 align:start position:0%
other other girls throughout high school
 
05:53:09.510 --> 05:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
she says my closest friends played
 
05:53:10.868 --> 05:53:10.878 align:start position:0%
soccer with me in middle school and
 
05:53:12.788 --> 05:53:12.798 align:start position:0%
through high school no one had a problem
 
05:53:14.910 --> 05:53:14.920 align:start position:0%
with me being transgender there were no
 
05:53:16.590 --> 05:53:16.600 align:start position:0%
issues in the locker rooms or bathrooms
 
05:53:18.030 --> 05:53:18.040 align:start position:0%
and I was treated just like everyone
 
05:53:19.948 --> 05:53:19.958 align:start position:0%
else I guarantee that no one on the
 
05:53:21.750 --> 05:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
opposing team has any idea that I am
 
05:53:23.868 --> 05:53:23.878 align:start position:0%
transgender playing on a team is such a
 
05:53:25.910 --> 05:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
unique experience with many life lessons
 
05:53:27.510 --> 05:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
I enjoyed the friendships the school
 
05:53:29.230 --> 05:53:29.240 align:start position:0%
spirit the giv and take necessary to
 
05:53:31.628 --> 05:53:31.638 align:start position:0%
create successful plays the exercise
 
05:53:33.190 --> 05:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
learning to handle the feed and be a
 
05:53:35.190 --> 05:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
good sport in fact the support that I
 
05:53:36.628 --> 05:53:36.638 align:start position:0%
received from my school when I explained
 
05:53:37.948 --> 05:53:37.958 align:start position:0%
to them in fifth grade that I was
 
05:53:40.350 --> 05:53:40.360 align:start position:0%
transgender was amazing my classmates
 
05:53:41.750 --> 05:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
and teachers were instrumental in
 
05:53:43.468 --> 05:53:43.478 align:start position:0%
helping me develop confidence and
 
05:53:45.750 --> 05:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
self-esteem something that unfortunately
 
05:53:48.430 --> 05:53:48.440 align:start position:0%
not all trans kids experience after I
 
05:53:49.788 --> 05:53:49.798 align:start position:0%
came out I was treated like all the
 
05:53:51.590 --> 05:53:51.600 align:start position:0%
other girls in every part of school in
 
05:53:53.468 --> 05:53:53.478 align:start position:0%
the classroom in the art studio on the
 
05:53:55.708 --> 05:53:55.718 align:start position:0%
theater stage and on the soccer field
 
05:53:56.830 --> 05:53:56.840 align:start position:0%
there's no way I would have ever
 
05:53:58.628 --> 05:53:58.638 align:start position:0%
competed on the boys team because I am a
 
05:54:01.430 --> 05:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
girl now as a 19-year-old trans woman I
 
05:54:03.070 --> 05:54:03.080 align:start position:0%
can fully appreciate all that Sports
 
05:54:04.390 --> 05:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
provided me as a
 
05:54:07.150 --> 05:54:07.160 align:start position:0%
student contrary to the imagined
 
05:54:10.430 --> 05:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
testimony by a few testifiers previously
 
05:54:12.430 --> 05:54:12.440 align:start position:0%
one of Lan's teammates Ellie said I had
 
05:54:13.910 --> 05:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
the pleasure of having Lane on my team
 
05:54:15.310 --> 05:54:15.320 align:start position:0%
during high school during the soccer
 
05:54:17.830 --> 05:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
Seasons Lan was a fantastic teammate at
 
05:54:19.390 --> 05:54:19.400 align:start position:0%
no point did I think she didn't deserve
 
05:54:21.390 --> 05:54:21.400 align:start position:0%
a spot on the team or was out of place
 
05:54:22.788 --> 05:54:22.798 align:start position:0%
she was where she should have been and I
 
05:54:24.750 --> 05:54:24.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have had it any other way
 
05:54:27.430 --> 05:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
another one of Lan's teammates it said
 
05:54:28.990 --> 05:54:29.000 align:start position:0%
my good friend Johson was on my high
 
05:54:30.750 --> 05:54:30.760 align:start position:0%
school soccer team for two years she was
 
05:54:32.310 --> 05:54:32.320 align:start position:0%
always the first one ready to play and
 
05:54:34.270 --> 05:54:34.280 align:start position:0%
the last to leave the field lean was
 
05:54:36.270 --> 05:54:36.280 align:start position:0%
incredible to watch on the field and
 
05:54:37.948 --> 05:54:37.958 align:start position:0%
hard to defend against not because she
 
05:54:39.590 --> 05:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
was born male or because she had any
 
05:54:41.350 --> 05:54:41.360 align:start position:0%
biological Advantage but because she
 
05:54:43.708 --> 05:54:43.718 align:start position:0%
brought her all to every single practice
 
05:54:46.430 --> 05:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
in game thank you thank you very much
 
05:54:47.670 --> 05:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
05:54:49.670 --> 05:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
committee yes representative Miler thank
 
05:54:51.548 --> 05:54:51.558 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for being
 
05:54:55.310 --> 05:54:55.320 align:start position:0%
here you've heard many here today talk
 
05:54:57.708 --> 05:54:57.718 align:start position:0%
about the physical concerns as far as
 
05:55:00.270 --> 05:55:00.280 align:start position:0%
heart and safety how do you respond to
 
05:55:02.868 --> 05:55:02.878 align:start position:0%
those comments they create an
 
05:55:05.628 --> 05:55:05.638 align:start position:0%
environment in which young transgender
 
05:55:07.708 --> 05:55:07.718 align:start position:0%
people particularly the girls and women
 
05:55:11.708 --> 05:55:11.718 align:start position:0%
being targeted by this bill I'll feel
 
05:55:14.788 --> 05:55:14.798 align:start position:0%
that their inherent nature is dangerous
 
05:55:17.590 --> 05:55:17.600 align:start position:0%
to others they are told this in many
 
05:55:19.310 --> 05:55:19.320 align:start position:0%
ways by many of the bills that have been
 
05:55:21.788 --> 05:55:21.798 align:start position:0%
introduced trying to limit what they can
 
05:55:26.270 --> 05:55:26.280 align:start position:0%
be a part of and it is as bad for their
 
05:55:29.468 --> 05:55:29.478 align:start position:0%
mental health and for or inclusion in
 
05:55:29.478 --> 05:55:30.430 align:start position:0%
mental health and for or inclusion in
all

05:55:30.430 --> 05:55:30.440 align:start position:0%
all
 
05:55:33.590 --> 05:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
spaces further questions representative
 
05:55:35.708 --> 05:55:35.718 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:55:37.270 --> 05:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
being here and taking my
 
05:55:40.548 --> 05:55:40.558 align:start position:0%
question so I believe there's about
 
05:55:42.948 --> 05:55:42.958 align:start position:0%
160,000 public school students in New
 
05:55:46.310 --> 05:55:46.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm not sure how many
 
05:55:48.868 --> 05:55:48.878 align:start position:0%
students in other educational settings
 
05:55:52.230 --> 05:55:52.240 align:start position:0%
but say 200,000 or so could you speak to
 
05:55:54.430 --> 05:55:54.440 align:start position:0%
us about how many of those students are
 
05:55:57.190 --> 05:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
trans students I don't know the exact
 
05:55:59.628 --> 05:55:59.638 align:start position:0%
number of transgender students um
 
05:56:02.468 --> 05:56:02.478 align:start position:0%
although I believe it's about 1% of the
 
05:56:04.670 --> 05:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
adult population I think that is a
 
05:56:08.708 --> 05:56:08.718 align:start position:0%
little bit higher in um or School aged
 
05:56:12.150 --> 05:56:12.160 align:start position:0%
age children now because in many ways
 
05:56:14.628 --> 05:56:14.638 align:start position:0%
acceptance has grown and more people are
 
05:56:16.910 --> 05:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
more comfortable coming out at earlier
 
05:56:19.948 --> 05:56:19.958 align:start position:0%
ages and being themselves um but when
 
05:56:22.350 --> 05:56:22.360 align:start position:0%
you think about all trans children in
 
05:56:24.990 --> 05:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
schools and then the percentage of them
 
05:56:29.030 --> 05:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
that want to play sports and um there
 
05:56:31.110 --> 05:56:31.120 align:start position:0%
that is a very
 
05:56:35.110 --> 05:56:35.120 align:start position:0%
small handful of kids across as the
 
05:56:37.390 --> 05:56:37.400 align:start position:0%
state that this bill takes particular
 
05:56:40.708 --> 05:56:40.718 align:start position:0%
interest in and particularly targets
 
05:56:42.830 --> 05:56:42.840 align:start position:0%
further question from the further
 
05:56:44.750 --> 05:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee thank you
 
05:56:56.788 --> 05:56:56.798 align:start position:0%

angeletta
 
05:57:01.708 --> 05:57:01.718 align:start position:0%
welcome hello I just want to start off
 
05:57:02.830 --> 05:57:02.840 align:start position:0%
by saying the world needs love and
 
05:57:05.350 --> 05:57:05.360 align:start position:0%
equality more than anything right now
 
05:57:06.830 --> 05:57:06.840 align:start position:0%
trench gender women are women and
 
05:57:09.190 --> 05:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
transgender men are men in no way am I
 
05:57:10.990 --> 05:57:11.000 align:start position:0%
discrediting the struggle battle or
 
05:57:12.628 --> 05:57:12.638 align:start position:0%
Journey one with gender dysphoria has to
 
05:57:14.270 --> 05:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
go through and the hardships that come
 
05:57:16.788 --> 05:57:16.798 align:start position:0%
with that being who you truly are is a
 
05:57:18.110 --> 05:57:18.120 align:start position:0%
beautiful thing that should be accepted
 
05:57:20.510 --> 05:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
no matter who you are um this doesn't
 
05:57:21.590 --> 05:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
change the fact that people who are
 
05:57:23.590 --> 05:57:23.600 align:start position:0%
trans are in fact transgender things
 
05:57:25.270 --> 05:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
like height build and strength don't
 
05:57:27.830 --> 05:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
change unless done artificially and in
 
05:57:29.230 --> 05:57:29.240 align:start position:0%
an effort not to bring down the trans
 
05:57:30.750 --> 05:57:30.760 align:start position:0%
Community we are bringing down the women
 
05:57:32.310 --> 05:57:32.320 align:start position:0%
who Train Day and Night for years to
 
05:57:34.190 --> 05:57:34.200 align:start position:0%
compete in these Sports and we rob them
 
05:57:35.628 --> 05:57:35.638 align:start position:0%
of recognition for their hard work when
 
05:57:36.788 --> 05:57:36.798 align:start position:0%
we put them against people they don't
 
05:57:38.590 --> 05:57:38.600 align:start position:0%
stand a chance with and they already
 
05:57:39.910 --> 05:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
have to fight 10 times harder in this
 
05:57:42.350 --> 05:57:42.360 align:start position:0%
world to be perceived as equal and the
 
05:57:44.070 --> 05:57:44.080 align:start position:0%
other way around empowering men who are
 
05:57:45.990 --> 05:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
beating down people in sports who don't
 
05:57:47.548 --> 05:57:47.558 align:start position:0%
stand a
 
05:57:50.350 --> 05:57:50.360 align:start position:0%
chance um is unfair to them as well on
 
05:57:51.990 --> 05:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
how to place trans people in sports I'm
 
05:57:53.788 --> 05:57:53.798 align:start position:0%
not too sure maybe placing people in
 
05:57:55.390 --> 05:57:55.400 align:start position:0%
groups based on weight height and
 
05:57:57.270 --> 05:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
fairness or maybe they're own category
 
05:57:59.910 --> 05:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
not in effort to seg segregate but to be
 
05:58:01.270 --> 05:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
fair for everyone including the trans
 
05:58:03.270 --> 05:58:03.280 align:start position:0%
Community who also deserves it the world
 
05:58:04.948 --> 05:58:04.958 align:start position:0%
is constantly adapting to change and we
 
05:58:06.190 --> 05:58:06.200 align:start position:0%
just need to figure out how to change
 
05:58:08.628 --> 05:58:08.638 align:start position:0%
the world to make things fair for all
 
05:58:10.510 --> 05:58:10.520 align:start position:0%
and having unfair fights in sports is an
 
05:58:12.510 --> 05:58:12.520 align:start position:0%
incorrect way of doing it thank you
 
05:58:13.990 --> 05:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much other questions from
 
05:58:18.788 --> 05:58:18.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:21.310 --> 05:58:21.320 align:start position:0%
you do you do you would you like to
 
05:58:25.070 --> 05:58:25.080 align:start position:0%
submit that report or is it what your
 
05:58:28.030 --> 05:58:28.040 align:start position:0%
your not oh uh sure do I just just it to
 
05:58:31.868 --> 05:58:31.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:40.350 --> 05:58:40.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:43.110 --> 05:58:43.120 align:start position:0%
Smith hello committee members thank you
 
05:58:45.910 --> 05:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my testimony um I am Jennifer
 
05:58:48.948 --> 05:58:48.958 align:start position:0%
Smith I'm a retired Family Practice
 
05:58:51.990 --> 05:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
physician I also am transgender if that
 
05:58:54.910 --> 05:58:54.920 align:start position:0%
isn't obvious to you um and I was a bit
 
05:58:57.110 --> 05:58:57.120 align:start position:0%
of an athlete at times and I still am I
 
05:58:58.868 --> 05:58:58.878 align:start position:0%
still played ten in fact that's why I
 
05:59:01.510 --> 05:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
was late my teammates don't seem to have
 
05:59:03.310 --> 05:59:03.320 align:start position:0%
a problem and some of them are taller
 
05:59:05.110 --> 05:59:05.120 align:start position:0%
and at least one of them hits a lot
 
05:59:08.910 --> 05:59:08.920 align:start position:0%
harder than I do um so I just want to
 
05:59:13.910 --> 05:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
talk to fairness for transgender girls
 
05:59:15.750 --> 05:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
because in point of fact they will have
 
05:59:19.750 --> 05:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
neither skeletal nor hormonal
 
05:59:23.150 --> 05:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
advantages if they're competing and I'm
 
05:59:24.910 --> 05:59:24.920 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions on this and I
 
05:59:26.910 --> 05:59:26.920 align:start position:0%
have sent you the written testimony
 
05:59:28.190 --> 05:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
through the online
 
05:59:30.788 --> 05:59:30.798 align:start position:0%
portal um it's about a page and a half I
 
05:59:34.030 --> 05:59:34.040 align:start position:0%
definitely won't read it but as anybody
 
05:59:36.230 --> 05:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
can appreciate skeletal differences
 
05:59:39.708 --> 05:59:39.718 align:start position:0%
occur and there is overlap between
 
05:59:45.270 --> 05:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
Sexes and the problem of high levels of
 
05:59:47.788 --> 05:59:47.798 align:start position:0%
testosterone does not exist for the
 
05:59:50.310 --> 05:59:50.320 align:start position:0%
transgender girl who has started
 
05:59:53.948 --> 05:59:53.958 align:start position:0%
transition before puberty and I can tell
 
05:59:56.708 --> 05:59:56.718 align:start position:0%
you from my own experience of getting
 
06:00:00.190 --> 06:00:00.200 align:start position:0%
rid of the unpleasantness of
 
06:00:03.310 --> 06:00:03.320 align:start position:0%
testosterone that you definitely lose a
 
06:00:05.948 --> 06:00:05.958 align:start position:0%
lot of muscle mass and speed and
 
06:00:08.430 --> 06:00:08.440 align:start position:0%
strength I was still a distance runner
 
06:00:11.670 --> 06:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
at the time that I got rid of that I
 
06:00:14.948 --> 06:00:14.958 align:start position:0%
could tell my the times were dropping
 
06:00:17.310 --> 06:00:17.320 align:start position:0%
fast I was a pretty good Sprinter at the
 
06:00:19.750 --> 06:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
end of a race you know it's like no I'm
 
06:00:21.270 --> 06:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
just not that
 
06:00:24.510 --> 06:00:24.520 align:start position:0%
anymore I was always beaten by some of
 
06:00:28.190 --> 06:00:28.200 align:start position:0%
the elite women in races even when I had
 
06:00:32.030 --> 06:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
testosterone but the notion that the
 
06:00:34.468 --> 06:00:34.478 align:start position:0%
vast majority of
 
06:00:37.708 --> 06:00:37.718 align:start position:0%
transgender girls and women are somehow
 
06:00:40.990 --> 06:00:41.000 align:start position:0%
putting other women at a disadvantage
 
06:00:42.708 --> 06:00:42.718 align:start position:0%
just isn't really
 
06:00:45.590 --> 06:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
true and um by the way I do use the
 
06:00:48.910 --> 06:00:48.920 align:start position:0%
locker room at the Y and no one seems to
 
06:00:50.750 --> 06:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
have a problem with that nor do I think
 
06:00:50.760 --> 06:00:51.948 align:start position:0%
have a problem with that nor do I think
they

06:00:51.948 --> 06:00:51.958 align:start position:0%
they
 
06:00:55.430 --> 06:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
should and u i I'm happy to take any
 
06:00:57.548 --> 06:00:57.558 align:start position:0%
questions and I hope some will read my
 
06:01:00.590 --> 06:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm on my yellow card is my
 
06:01:02.070 --> 06:01:02.080 align:start position:0%
phone number I'm afraid I didn't think
 
06:01:04.310 --> 06:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
to put that in but I'm happy to talk in
 
06:01:07.510 --> 06:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
detail to people yes there are cases at
 
06:01:10.310 --> 06:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
Elite Sports level like possibly Leah
 
06:01:12.270 --> 06:01:12.280 align:start position:0%
Thomas where there is an ongoing
 
06:01:14.670 --> 06:01:14.680 align:start position:0%
Advantage from two much skeletal
 
06:01:16.390 --> 06:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
development in a male
 
06:01:19.110 --> 06:01:19.120 align:start position:0%
direction thank you that's difficult
 
06:01:21.910 --> 06:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
issue any questions represent Miler
 
06:01:23.708 --> 06:01:23.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
06:01:27.948 --> 06:01:27.958 align:start position:0%
being here I'd like to have you talk a
 
06:01:30.708 --> 06:01:30.718 align:start position:0%
little bit about the
 
06:01:33.910 --> 06:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
transition that a trans person goes
 
06:01:36.628 --> 06:01:36.638 align:start position:0%
through the impression that some have I
 
06:01:39.590 --> 06:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
think is that if I want to if I want to
 
06:01:42.390 --> 06:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
go from male to female I just start
 
06:01:43.868 --> 06:01:43.878 align:start position:0%
wearing female
 
06:01:46.110 --> 06:01:46.120 align:start position:0%
clothes could you talk a little bit from
 
06:01:48.868 --> 06:01:48.878 align:start position:0%
a medical standpoint about what that
 
06:01:52.548 --> 06:01:52.558 align:start position:0%
transition process is well things are
 
06:01:54.510 --> 06:01:54.520 align:start position:0%
changing somewhat but when I
 
06:01:57.468 --> 06:01:57.478 align:start position:0%
transitioned it took a full year of
 
06:02:00.948 --> 06:02:00.958 align:start position:0%
living socially as a female to get
 
06:02:03.910 --> 06:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
permission to move forward you often
 
06:02:06.670 --> 06:02:06.680 align:start position:0%
were allowed to start taking some
 
06:02:09.670 --> 06:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
hormones I'm a physician I had access to
 
06:02:11.948 --> 06:02:11.958 align:start position:0%
hormones before I actually even talked
 
06:02:12.868 --> 06:02:12.878 align:start position:0%
to a
 
06:02:16.548 --> 06:02:16.558 align:start position:0%
counselor um so you know I I found that
 
06:02:18.868 --> 06:02:18.878 align:start position:0%
yes and to speak to the spiritual side
 
06:02:22.030 --> 06:02:22.040 align:start position:0%
of it that someone else mentioned yeah
 
06:02:24.788 --> 06:02:24.798 align:start position:0%
it suddenly made sense all of those
 
06:02:27.708 --> 06:02:27.718 align:start position:0%
struggles and I am a religious person
 
06:02:31.910 --> 06:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to discuss um the material
 
06:02:34.990 --> 06:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
that's in Matthew 19 if somebody wants
 
06:02:38.750 --> 06:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
to discuss that um because it helped me
 
06:02:43.830 --> 06:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
figure out who I was um and uh there's
 
06:02:46.510 --> 06:02:46.520 align:start position:0%
just a lot of
 
06:02:48.830 --> 06:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
misinformation we're very careful about
 
06:02:50.910 --> 06:02:50.920 align:start position:0%
this and every one of the young
 
06:02:53.310 --> 06:02:53.320 align:start position:0%
transgender girls that I have known
 
06:02:54.628 --> 06:02:54.638 align:start position:0%
through P
 
06:02:58.390 --> 06:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
flag parents had to be puru persuaded by
 
06:03:01.468 --> 06:03:01.478 align:start position:0%
their daughters to look into this and
 
06:03:04.750 --> 06:03:04.760 align:start position:0%
find out about what this is about and
 
06:03:06.990 --> 06:03:07.000 align:start position:0%
they would come to P FL trying to learn
 
06:03:09.350 --> 06:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
and struggling with it and then find
 
06:03:11.468 --> 06:03:11.478 align:start position:0%
that their daughters were suddenly no
 
06:03:13.548 --> 06:03:13.558 align:start position:0%
longer these miserable little kids they
 
06:03:17.070 --> 06:03:17.080 align:start position:0%
were happy they were doing well and they
 
06:03:19.708 --> 06:03:19.718 align:start position:0%
continued to do well and putting up a
 
06:03:22.750 --> 06:03:22.760 align:start position:0%
roadblock to their inclusion in school
 
06:03:25.868 --> 06:03:25.878 align:start position:0%
sports makes no sense
 
06:03:29.070 --> 06:03:29.080 align:start position:0%
whatsoever and you know if you want to
 
06:03:32.390 --> 06:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
find a way to Advantage girls that's
 
06:03:35.708 --> 06:03:35.718 align:start position:0%
great but please don't do that at the
 
06:03:38.590 --> 06:03:38.600 align:start position:0%
expense of transgender girls they do not
 
06:03:41.670 --> 06:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
have either skeletal or hormonal
 
06:03:44.270 --> 06:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
advantages because they started out with
 
06:03:46.190 --> 06:03:46.200 align:start position:0%
an X and A Y
 
06:03:49.750 --> 06:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
chromosome it's just not true and by the
 
06:03:53.430 --> 06:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
way there are cisgender that is not
 
06:03:56.750 --> 06:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
transgender girls who have a hormonal
 
06:03:59.468 --> 06:03:59.478 align:start position:0%
advantage I mean skeletal Advantage is
 
06:04:02.430 --> 06:04:02.440 align:start position:0%
obvious but if you have polyic ovary
 
06:04:04.430 --> 06:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
syndrome and that happens to be pretty
 
06:04:06.788 --> 06:04:06.798 align:start position:0%
common your Androgen levels your
 
06:04:08.990 --> 06:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
testosterone levels because all women
 
06:04:11.510 --> 06:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
have testosterone if their ovaries are
 
06:04:13.990 --> 06:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
functioning your testosterone level is
 
06:04:17.270 --> 06:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
considerably higher and I did put a a
 
06:04:20.190 --> 06:04:20.200 align:start position:0%
link in the end of my letter about where
 
06:04:23.150 --> 06:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
you can find something that tells about
 
06:04:27.190 --> 06:04:27.200 align:start position:0%
how much more common that high
 
06:04:31.150 --> 06:04:31.160 align:start position:0%
testosterone level is in Elite women's
 
06:04:36.110 --> 06:04:36.120 align:start position:0%
sports winners it's a just it is very
 
06:04:38.590 --> 06:04:38.600 align:start position:0%
clear that testosterone makes a
 
06:04:41.868 --> 06:04:41.878 align:start position:0%
difference but those transgender girls
 
06:04:45.150 --> 06:04:45.160 align:start position:0%
who transition early aren't going to
 
06:04:46.910 --> 06:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
have that advantage in fact they will be
 
06:04:48.150 --> 06:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
at some
 
06:04:51.990 --> 06:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
disadvantage from the blockage with the
 
06:04:54.868 --> 06:04:54.878 align:start position:0%
hormone blockers and then with starting
 
06:04:57.190 --> 06:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
estrogen at an appropriate age which
 
06:04:58.750 --> 06:04:58.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there are other bills that
 
06:05:01.110 --> 06:05:01.120 align:start position:0%
are trying to
 
06:05:03.510 --> 06:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
prevent thank you very much are there
 
06:05:05.350 --> 06:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
06:05:07.910 --> 06:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
represent belon thank you Mr chair and
 
06:05:09.030 --> 06:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here for your
 
06:05:11.548 --> 06:05:11.558 align:start position:0%
testimony um you've testified that there
 
06:05:14.190 --> 06:05:14.200 align:start position:0%
is no inherent advantage to a person
 
06:05:16.788 --> 06:05:16.798 align:start position:0%
because of the uh cross- sex hormones or
 
06:05:18.310 --> 06:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
any sort of medical procedures that they
 
06:05:18.320 --> 06:05:18.990 align:start position:0%
any sort of medical procedures that they
were

06:05:18.990 --> 06:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
were
 
06:05:21.430 --> 06:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
undertaking however is it not true that
 
06:05:23.190 --> 06:05:23.200 align:start position:0%
as of now anyway there there is no
 
06:05:24.830 --> 06:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
requirement that a person begin
 
06:05:26.468 --> 06:05:26.478 align:start position:0%
undergoing any sort of medical
 
06:05:28.868 --> 06:05:28.878 align:start position:0%
procedures prior to identifying and
 
06:05:31.548 --> 06:05:31.558 align:start position:0%
playing sports on on whatever team they
 
06:05:33.708 --> 06:05:33.718 align:start position:0%
they would choose to be on I don't know
 
06:05:36.030 --> 06:05:36.040 align:start position:0%
the answer to that and you might want to
 
06:05:39.070 --> 06:05:39.080 align:start position:0%
craft something that does the kind of
 
06:05:41.948 --> 06:05:41.958 align:start position:0%
protection that you think you want
 
06:05:43.628 --> 06:05:43.638 align:start position:0%
without discriminating against
 
06:05:47.830 --> 06:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
transgender girls who are not already
 
06:05:50.230 --> 06:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
well into puberty because this bill
 
06:05:54.350 --> 06:05:54.360 align:start position:0%
would in fact do that if it succeeds but
 
06:05:56.708 --> 06:05:56.718 align:start position:0%
I would note that birth certificates are
 
06:05:59.708 --> 06:05:59.718 align:start position:0%
amend in many states with no notation as
 
06:06:02.070 --> 06:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
to the fact that they were amended and
 
06:06:04.030 --> 06:06:04.040 align:start position:0%
you might also want to consider that
 
06:06:06.590 --> 06:06:06.600 align:start position:0%
there are difficulties in figuring out
 
06:06:10.110 --> 06:06:10.120 align:start position:0%
who is male and female at
 
06:06:12.510 --> 06:06:12.520 align:start position:0%
times thank thank you very much further
 
06:06:15.150 --> 06:06:15.160 align:start position:0%
questions representa Tanner thank you
 
06:06:16.910 --> 06:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
06:06:18.468 --> 06:06:18.478 align:start position:0%
you've obviously been in a number of
 
06:06:22.468 --> 06:06:22.478 align:start position:0%
locker rooms and I was wondering if you
 
06:06:24.510 --> 06:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
could explain the difference between
 
06:06:26.270 --> 06:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
that you noticed between men's and
 
06:06:29.310 --> 06:06:29.320 align:start position:0%
women's locker rooms and how more
 
06:06:31.350 --> 06:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
private women's locker rooms generally
 
06:06:33.468 --> 06:06:33.478 align:start position:0%
are yeah they're generally quite private
 
06:06:35.270 --> 06:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
I've been in several because I do play
 
06:06:40.548 --> 06:06:40.558 align:start position:0%
on a team that travels so um I I just
 
06:06:43.190 --> 06:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
don't see an issue anywhere that I've
 
06:06:45.788 --> 06:06:45.798 align:start position:0%
been and most women are quite private
 
06:06:47.468 --> 06:06:47.478 align:start position:0%
although I have seen a couple of women
 
06:06:49.910 --> 06:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
who didn't bother and were in a hurry
 
06:06:52.468 --> 06:06:52.478 align:start position:0%
and just dis rubbed but you know as a
 
06:06:54.430 --> 06:06:54.440 align:start position:0%
physician it doesn't exactly bother me
 
06:06:58.948 --> 06:06:58.958 align:start position:0%
to see a woman naked so and I don't pay
 
06:07:01.750 --> 06:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
attention thank you further
 
06:07:04.468 --> 06:07:04.478 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
06:07:07.110 --> 06:07:07.120 align:start position:0%
Ford thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
06:07:09.750 --> 06:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm intrigued a
 
06:07:12.150 --> 06:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
bit by your discussion of the
 
06:07:15.548 --> 06:07:15.558 align:start position:0%
developmental aspect of the transition
 
06:07:17.830 --> 06:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
hormonally and so
 
06:07:21.110 --> 06:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
forth how would you suggest that this be
 
06:07:24.628 --> 06:07:24.638 align:start position:0%
addressed in the complexities of law
 
06:07:27.590 --> 06:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
which tend to be either or or or you
 
06:07:31.590 --> 06:07:31.600 align:start position:0%
know defined in concrete kinds of terms
 
06:07:33.510 --> 06:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
I don't have a good suggestion cuz I
 
06:07:36.070 --> 06:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
don't know that there is one but you
 
06:07:39.230 --> 06:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
know the discouragement that people feel
 
06:07:42.868 --> 06:07:42.878 align:start position:0%
at being othered is often enough to keep
 
06:07:45.750 --> 06:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
someone who's say you know gone through
 
06:07:48.708 --> 06:07:48.718 align:start position:0%
most of male puberty um it certainly
 
06:07:51.708 --> 06:07:51.718 align:start position:0%
discouraged me at a point when I was
 
06:07:54.510 --> 06:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
still playing pickup soccer because I
 
06:07:58.868 --> 06:07:58.878 align:start position:0%
was a varsity soccer player um from even
 
06:08:01.708 --> 06:08:01.718 align:start position:0%
thinking about whether I was going to
 
06:08:05.070 --> 06:08:05.080 align:start position:0%
play seriously with other women other
 
06:08:09.788 --> 06:08:09.798 align:start position:0%
than in a coed fun kind of way it's a
 
06:08:12.070 --> 06:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
difficult question if you get into that
 
06:08:13.910 --> 06:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
level and that's why I mentioned Leah
 
06:08:17.190 --> 06:08:17.200 align:start position:0%
Thomas I'm not sure I have no idea Leah
 
06:08:18.270 --> 06:08:18.280 align:start position:0%
Thomas is
 
06:08:21.628 --> 06:08:21.638 align:start position:0%
a highlevel swimmer in the
 
06:08:25.468 --> 06:08:25.478 align:start position:0%
NCAA um taking female hormones that have
 
06:08:27.350 --> 06:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
reduced her
 
06:08:29.390 --> 06:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
male hormones and perhaps at this point
 
06:08:32.590 --> 06:08:32.600 align:start position:0%
she has no further ability to secrete
 
06:08:35.830 --> 06:08:35.840 align:start position:0%
male hormones but yeah bigger hands
 
06:08:35.840 --> 06:08:36.470 align:start position:0%
male hormones but yeah bigger hands
larger

06:08:36.470 --> 06:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
larger
 
06:08:36.480 --> 06:08:37.788 align:start position:0%
larger
[Music]

06:08:37.788 --> 06:08:37.798 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:08:41.270 --> 06:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
lungs lots of variation among women
 
06:08:45.150 --> 06:08:45.160 align:start position:0%
swimmers anyway so is that something
 
06:08:46.948 --> 06:08:46.958 align:start position:0%
that can easily be sorted out by the
 
06:08:49.948 --> 06:08:49.958 align:start position:0%
NCAA I don't know and I think to ask our
 
06:08:51.750 --> 06:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
high schools to sort this
 
06:08:54.590 --> 06:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
out very difficult and I just don't
 
06:08:57.468 --> 06:08:57.478 align:start position:0%
think that it is real that there are
 
06:08:59.548 --> 06:08:59.558 align:start position:0%
going to be all kinds
 
06:09:02.150 --> 06:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
of people who have gone through a lot of
 
06:09:05.750 --> 06:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
male puberty trying to invade women's
 
06:09:08.708 --> 06:09:08.718 align:start position:0%
sports just don't think so thank you uh
 
06:09:10.310 --> 06:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee not
 
06:09:12.110 --> 06:09:12.120 align:start position:0%

and oops sorry and an alderman in
 
06:09:38.468 --> 06:09:38.478 align:start position:0%
Manchester and I'm really sad that we
 
06:09:41.310 --> 06:09:41.320 align:start position:0%
even have to be here discussing this and
 
06:09:43.708 --> 06:09:43.718 align:start position:0%
I believe that trans girls believe
 
06:09:46.628 --> 06:09:46.638 align:start position:0%
they're trans girl they're girls but in
 
06:09:49.910 --> 06:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
fact science says they're not and men
 
06:09:52.190 --> 06:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
have penises and men have prostate
 
06:09:55.110 --> 06:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
cancer prostates and I advocate for
 
06:09:57.670 --> 06:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
prostate cancer all the time we are just
 
06:10:00.230 --> 06:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
different and we It's Our obligation and
 
06:10:03.150 --> 06:10:03.160 align:start position:0%
responsibility to protect girls rights
 
06:10:05.548 --> 06:10:05.558 align:start position:0%
and their privacy and if we're not we're
 
06:10:09.110 --> 06:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
violating their privacy and and their
 
06:10:10.868 --> 06:10:10.878 align:start position:0%
rights and it's really really sad and
 
06:10:13.750 --> 06:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
I'm just um a concerned citizen as well
 
06:10:15.510 --> 06:10:15.520 align:start position:0%

Mental Illness uh Nami New Hampshire is
 
06:10:51.750 --> 06:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
a nonprofit Grassroots organization

today speak in opposition to hb25 I'll
 
06:11:01.670 --> 06:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
keep my testimony brief um nomin
 
06:11:02.868 --> 06:11:02.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire believes that freedom from
 
06:11:04.590 --> 06:11:04.600 align:start position:0%
stigma and discrimination is crucial to
 
06:11:06.670 --> 06:11:06.680 align:start position:0%
mental Wellness acceptance and support
 
06:11:08.310 --> 06:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
within one's Community plays a key role
 
06:11:09.628 --> 06:11:09.638 align:start position:0%
in the mental health of all people
 
06:11:11.990 --> 06:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
including trans and non-binary youth
 
06:11:13.990 --> 06:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
this is especially true for team sports
 
06:11:16.150 --> 06:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
where students learn to connect with
 
06:11:18.948 --> 06:11:18.958 align:start position:0%
their peers and their Community HB 1205
 
06:11:20.830 --> 06:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
would limit access to these spaces
 
06:11:22.510 --> 06:11:22.520 align:start position:0%
putting the mental health of trans and
 
06:11:24.830 --> 06:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
non-binary youth at risk and then lastly
 
06:11:25.990 --> 06:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to emphasize that
 
06:11:28.070 --> 06:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
discriminator policies are damaging
 
06:11:30.110 --> 06:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
whether or not they pass into law
 
06:11:32.548 --> 06:11:32.558 align:start position:0%
according to the Trevor Project in 2023
 
06:11:35.230 --> 06:11:35.240 align:start position:0%
quote nearly one in three lgbtq young
 
06:11:37.390 --> 06:11:37.400 align:start position:0%
people said their mental health was poor
 
06:11:39.230 --> 06:11:39.240 align:start position:0%
most of the time or always due to
 
06:11:42.230 --> 06:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
anti-lgbtq policies and legislation it's
 
06:11:44.390 --> 06:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
crucial that our policies promote mental
 
06:11:46.150 --> 06:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
wellness and create accepting affirming
 
06:11:48.350 --> 06:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
environments rather than limit them for
 
06:11:49.670 --> 06:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
these reasons I urge the committee to
 
06:11:51.510 --> 06:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
vote inexpedient to legislate for HP
 
06:11:54.350 --> 06:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
1205 thank you thank you very much other
 
06:11:56.708 --> 06:11:56.718 align:start position:0%

moment I moved into town I played Sports
 
06:12:47.990 --> 06:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
one of my strongest memories as a young
 
06:12:50.868 --> 06:12:50.878 align:start position:0%
Runner was a meet we had in sixth grade
 
06:12:52.468 --> 06:12:52.478 align:start position:0%
it was a combined race with the male and
 
06:12:55.190 --> 06:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
female athletes I came in second place
 
06:12:56.708 --> 06:12:56.718 align:start position:0%

University to run track my career
 
06:13:11.468 --> 06:13:11.478 align:start position:0%
continued there I go into this detail
 
06:13:13.350 --> 06:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
with my athletic career not to receive
 
06:13:15.190 --> 06:13:15.200 align:start position:0%
recognition but to emphasize that my
 
06:13:16.948 --> 06:13:16.958 align:start position:0%
accomplishments were not once Lesson by
 
06:13:19.150 --> 06:13:19.160 align:start position:0%
the runners I ran against they were only
 
06:13:21.590 --> 06:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
approved upon the lessons I learned from
 
06:13:23.750 --> 06:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
being an athlete were numerous as a
 
06:13:25.190 --> 06:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
5-year-old soccer player I learned
 
06:13:26.868 --> 06:13:26.878 align:start position:0%
teamwork and dedication
 
06:13:28.468 --> 06:13:28.478 align:start position:0%
as an 18-year-old Runner I learned
 
06:13:30.708 --> 06:13:30.718 align:start position:0%
self-discipline and drive receiving a
 
06:13:32.230 --> 06:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
second place finish at the state meet my
 
06:13:34.110 --> 06:13:34.120 align:start position:0%
senior year I learned humility and Grace
 
06:13:36.510 --> 06:13:36.520 align:start position:0%
with my loss my time as an athlete
 
06:13:38.468 --> 06:13:38.478 align:start position:0%
grounded my Foundation as an adult it
 
06:13:39.948 --> 06:13:39.958 align:start position:0%
translated into my life through my
 
06:13:41.590 --> 06:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
determination Drive empathy and
 
06:13:42.990 --> 06:13:43.000 align:start position:0%
compassion that is empowered me to
 
06:13:44.830 --> 06:13:44.840 align:start position:0%
successfully manage many obstacles in
 
06:13:47.190 --> 06:13:47.200 align:start position:0%
life as a mother My Hope for all of my
 
06:13:48.590 --> 06:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
children is that they will have the same
 
06:13:50.430 --> 06:13:50.440 align:start position:0%
opportunities I was given in sports to
 
06:13:51.830 --> 06:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
allow them to thrive and succeed in
 
06:13:54.788 --> 06:13:54.798 align:start position:0%
their adult lives in March last year my
 
06:13:56.350 --> 06:13:56.360 align:start position:0%
teen expressed they were experiencing
 
06:13:58.468 --> 06:13:58.478 align:start position:0%
near constant Suicidal Thoughts
 
06:13:59.990 --> 06:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
immediately we sought counseling for
 
06:14:02.230 --> 06:14:02.240 align:start position:0%
them after beginning therapy they were
 
06:14:03.590 --> 06:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
they were slowly able to talk more
 
06:14:06.150 --> 06:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
openly to us about things in September
 
06:14:07.430 --> 06:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
they came to me and asked if they were
 
06:14:09.990 --> 06:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
too old to start hormone therapy after
 
06:14:11.628 --> 06:14:11.638 align:start position:0%
that conversation a huge weight lifted
 
06:14:13.590 --> 06:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
from our child's mind we are now
 
06:14:15.110 --> 06:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
actively receiving care and are just
 
06:14:16.830 --> 06:14:16.840 align:start position:0%
beginning hormone replacement therapy
 
06:14:18.910 --> 06:14:18.920 align:start position:0%
also known as HRT to allow our child to
 
06:14:20.548 --> 06:14:20.558 align:start position:0%
have a more feminine body they feel at
 
06:14:22.990 --> 06:14:23.000 align:start position:0%
home in my career child has started
 
06:14:24.190 --> 06:14:24.200 align:start position:0%
their own journey and I'm here to
 
06:14:26.030 --> 06:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
support them we are incredibly fortunate
 
06:14:27.670 --> 06:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
to continue to have our child here with
 
06:14:30.270 --> 06:14:30.280 align:start position:0%
us today after their attempted suicide
 
06:14:32.190 --> 06:14:32.200 align:start position:0%
in October I sat in a doctor's office
 
06:14:33.868 --> 06:14:33.878 align:start position:0%
while at their side as they revealed
 
06:14:36.468 --> 06:14:36.478 align:start position:0%
details of that attempt their attempt
 
06:14:39.070 --> 06:14:39.080 align:start position:0%
was before they came to me about HRT
 
06:14:40.590 --> 06:14:40.600 align:start position:0%
before they were able to express how
 
06:14:43.110 --> 06:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
lost they were feeling in their own body
 
06:14:44.708 --> 06:14:44.718 align:start position:0%
I come before you today to share this
 
06:14:46.670 --> 06:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
very personal story to express my deep
 
06:14:48.150 --> 06:14:48.160 align:start position:0%
concern for what this bill is attempting
 
06:14:51.628 --> 06:14:51.638 align:start position:0%
to do HB 1205 escalates and exacerbates
 
06:14:53.590 --> 06:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
the isolation trans youth like my child
 
06:14:55.788 --> 06:14:55.798 align:start position:0%
have to endure supporting and promoting
 
06:14:57.030 --> 06:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
the blatant discrimination of
 
06:14:58.708 --> 06:14:58.718 align:start position:0%
transgender athletes is not the way of
 
06:15:00.910 --> 06:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
the granite state sport should be a
 
06:15:02.468 --> 06:15:02.478 align:start position:0%
place where we Embrace diversity and
 
06:15:05.110 --> 06:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
teamm ship my child has been an athlete
 
06:15:06.510 --> 06:15:06.520 align:start position:0%
since they were able to stand and kick a
 
06:15:08.110 --> 06:15:08.120 align:start position:0%
ball they had planned to play soccer
 
06:15:09.670 --> 06:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
their freshman year of high school very
 
06:15:11.390 --> 06:15:11.400 align:start position:0%
Fort Unfortunately they broke their
 
06:15:13.670 --> 06:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
wrist the first day of triy outs the
 
06:15:15.110 --> 06:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
orthopedic cleared them to play on the
 
06:15:16.510 --> 06:15:16.520 align:start position:0%
field but they insisted the only
 
06:15:19.750 --> 06:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
position for them was
 
06:15:22.190 --> 06:15:22.200 align:start position:0%
go I'll just finish off my last
 
06:15:24.030 --> 06:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
paragraph the relationships a person
 
06:15:25.310 --> 06:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
experiences through being a part of a
 
06:15:26.948 --> 06:15:26.958 align:start position:0%
sport are life-changing though few
 
06:15:28.350 --> 06:15:28.360 align:start position:0%
athletes reach the highest level of
 
06:15:29.910 --> 06:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
competition the lessons received through
 
06:15:32.270 --> 06:15:32.280 align:start position:0%
being a part of sport are immeasurable
 
06:15:33.910 --> 06:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
to allow a person to be a part of the
 
06:15:36.390 --> 06:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
sport they love is to not allow a person
 
06:15:37.788 --> 06:15:37.798 align:start position:0%
to be a part of the sport they love is
 
06:15:41.030 --> 06:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
cruel and inhumane please vote itl for

any questions for thank you thank you
very

06:16:00.990 --> 06:16:01.000 align:start position:0%
very
 
06:16:16.030 --> 06:16:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:19.230 --> 06:16:19.240 align:start position:0%
Banfield good afternoon anray Banfield
 
06:16:21.628 --> 06:16:21.638 align:start position:0%
um parental rights advocate in New
 
06:16:24.548 --> 06:16:24.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I will not repeat many of
 
06:16:26.750 --> 06:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
the things that have been said
 
06:16:29.070 --> 06:16:29.080 align:start position:0%
however uh I think that we can kind of
 
06:16:30.868 --> 06:16:30.878 align:start position:0%
clearly see that a lot of times this
 
06:16:33.628 --> 06:16:33.638 align:start position:0%
boils down to two sides you have females
 
06:16:36.830 --> 06:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
who have feelings and you have trans um
 
06:16:39.670 --> 06:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
students who have feelings and I think
 
06:16:41.430 --> 06:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes it boils down to finding
 
06:16:43.548 --> 06:16:43.558 align:start position:0%
common ground or finding a solution I
 
06:16:45.948 --> 06:16:45.958 align:start position:0%
think the young lady in the back
 
06:16:47.468 --> 06:16:47.478 align:start position:0%
mentioned something that I think we all
 
06:16:50.350 --> 06:16:50.360 align:start position:0%
need to take into consideration which is
 
06:16:54.030 --> 06:16:54.040 align:start position:0%
maybe a separate sports team for Trans
 
06:16:57.468 --> 06:16:57.478 align:start position:0%
students these girls fight they
 
06:17:00.150 --> 06:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
compete and then they have these
 
06:17:03.030 --> 06:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
scholarships and awards taken away from
 
06:17:05.070 --> 06:17:05.080 align:start position:0%
them we have to take that into
 
06:17:07.670 --> 06:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
consideration we have to take into
 
06:17:09.788 --> 06:17:09.798 align:start position:0%
consideration this the lock of rooms I
 
06:17:11.390 --> 06:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
think that that's that's one thing that
 
06:17:12.830 --> 06:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
we have to take into consideration there
 
06:17:16.990 --> 06:17:17.000 align:start position:0%
are examples where males have even
 
06:17:19.868 --> 06:17:19.878 align:start position:0%
portrayed themselves to be trans to gain
 
06:17:23.430 --> 06:17:23.440 align:start position:0%
access to um rooms and been arrested
 
06:17:26.948 --> 06:17:26.958 align:start position:0%
there's arrest records so my point is
 
06:17:29.070 --> 06:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
there are feelings on both sides and I
 
06:17:30.990 --> 06:17:31.000 align:start position:0%
do understand that and I think sometimes
 
06:17:34.590 --> 06:17:34.600 align:start position:0%
we have to look at how do we solve this
 
06:17:38.948 --> 06:17:38.958 align:start position:0%
this situation um also there was a a
 
06:17:41.868 --> 06:17:41.878 align:start position:0%
reference to what the hormones do to a
 
06:17:43.948 --> 06:17:43.958 align:start position:0%
body I would suggest checking the
 
06:17:46.190 --> 06:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
British Journal of sports medicine that
 
06:17:48.708 --> 06:17:48.718 align:start position:0%
suggests that trans women maintain an
 
06:17:50.868 --> 06:17:50.878 align:start position:0%
athletic advantage over biological
 
06:17:53.030 --> 06:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
females even one year after hormonal
 
06:17:54.830 --> 06:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
therapy so there's a an independent
 
06:17:58.510 --> 06:17:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:00.830 --> 06:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
um I think I covered everything that I
 
06:18:02.468 --> 06:18:02.478 align:start position:0%
wanted to cover you only gave me two
 
06:18:04.070 --> 06:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
minutes so I'm going to take that and oh
 
06:18:06.350 --> 06:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
you got 15 seconds left oh that's okay
 
06:18:08.310 --> 06:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
it's all right okay thank you very much
 
06:18:10.030 --> 06:18:10.040 align:start position:0%
other questions for
 
06:18:16.390 --> 06:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:24.910 --> 06:18:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:24.920 --> 06:18:29.270 align:start position:0%
 
is

06:18:29.270 --> 06:18:29.280 align:start position:0%

06:18:53.910 --> 06:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
clear to us that our daughter has always
 
06:18:57.150 --> 06:18:57.160 align:start position:0%
been a girl beginning at age three
 
06:18:58.788 --> 06:18:58.798 align:start position:0%
essentially as soon as she could string
 
06:19:00.110 --> 06:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
together a
 
06:19:03.390 --> 06:19:03.400 align:start position:0%
sentence for Christmas she asked Santa
 
06:19:05.628 --> 06:19:05.638 align:start position:0%
to turn her into a
 
06:19:09.990 --> 06:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
girl eventually as she got older she
 
06:19:12.230 --> 06:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to wear only girls
 
06:19:14.670 --> 06:19:14.680 align:start position:0%
clothes which she told us by making a
 
06:19:17.430 --> 06:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
skirt out of a blanket and begging to
 
06:19:18.670 --> 06:19:18.680 align:start position:0%
wear it to
 
06:19:21.070 --> 06:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
school then she wanted to use only the
 
06:19:21.080 --> 06:19:22.150 align:start position:0%
school then she wanted to use only the
female

06:19:22.150 --> 06:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
female
 
06:19:24.830 --> 06:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
pronoun which she told me one afternoon
 
06:19:26.948 --> 06:19:26.958 align:start position:0%
when I was trying to be funny and using
 
06:19:30.270 --> 06:19:30.280 align:start position:0%
my very very bad British accent and I
 
06:19:32.548 --> 06:19:32.558 align:start position:0%
called her sir and she told me I should
 
06:19:33.868 --> 06:19:33.878 align:start position:0%
call her
 
06:19:36.750 --> 06:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
ma'am when she got old got old enough to
 
06:19:40.070 --> 06:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
do Sports of course given that she is a
 
06:19:44.030 --> 06:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
girl she wanted to be on the girls team
 
06:19:46.468 --> 06:19:46.478 align:start position:0%
and she's been on girls teams and there
 
06:19:50.590 --> 06:19:50.600 align:start position:0%
has never been any
 
06:19:52.910 --> 06:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
issue over the years we've gone through
 
06:19:55.830 --> 06:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
the legal processes so that all of her
 
06:19:58.910 --> 06:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
documents reflect her female name in her
 
06:20:02.150 --> 06:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
female gender marker she receives gender
 
06:20:05.190 --> 06:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
confirming care with specific treatments
 
06:20:07.468 --> 06:20:07.478 align:start position:0%
determined by her team of
 
06:20:10.230 --> 06:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
interdisciplinary licensed providers and
 
06:20:10.240 --> 06:20:10.990 align:start position:0%
interdisciplinary licensed providers and
her

06:20:10.990 --> 06:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
her
 
06:20:13.548 --> 06:20:13.558 align:start position:0%
family she's old enough now that she has
 
06:20:16.830 --> 06:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
been out in the world as a trans girl
 
06:20:20.510 --> 06:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
for over half her life our daughter
 
06:20:21.948 --> 06:20:21.958 align:start position:0%
being a
 
06:20:25.270 --> 06:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
girl is like the color of her skin or
 
06:20:28.468 --> 06:20:28.478 align:start position:0%
her hey when she is an adult an
 
06:20:31.868 --> 06:20:31.878 align:start position:0%
inescapable inherent
 
06:20:34.190 --> 06:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
characteristic and if we could only just
 
06:20:37.510 --> 06:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
leave it at that it could be
 
06:20:42.150 --> 06:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
great but sometimes things are not great
 
06:20:44.590 --> 06:20:44.600 align:start position:0%
it was not great when a peer tried to go
 
06:20:45.868 --> 06:20:45.878 align:start position:0%
up her
 
06:20:49.150 --> 06:20:49.160 align:start position:0%
skirt or when a different peer bullied
 
06:20:51.390 --> 06:20:51.400 align:start position:0%
her for years so that she had to get a
 
06:20:53.070 --> 06:20:53.080 align:start position:0%
safety plan and the school resource
 
06:20:54.910 --> 06:20:54.920 align:start position:0%

from the committee
 
06:22:09.150 --> 06:22:09.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:12.670 --> 06:22:12.680 align:start position:0%
bitman good afternoon third time today
 
06:22:15.670 --> 06:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
all right I am uh speaking in support of
 
06:22:17.590 --> 06:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
06:22:20.270 --> 06:22:20.280 align:start position:0%
1205 um I first would like to disclose
 
06:22:23.270 --> 06:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
that I was the 1987 State doubles
 
06:22:26.750 --> 06:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
champion in B badminton in Connecticut
 
06:22:29.190 --> 06:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
um so I have been in competitive Sports
 
06:22:31.350 --> 06:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
all of my life I was in gymnastics
 
06:22:34.910 --> 06:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
swimming softball and basketball my mom
 
06:22:38.390 --> 06:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
who was 77 years old was ecstatic when
 
06:22:40.110 --> 06:22:40.120 align:start position:0%
Title 9 was passed because her
 
06:22:42.190 --> 06:22:42.200 align:start position:0%
generation wasn't allowed to compete in
 
06:22:45.230 --> 06:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
sports and that is why she afforded me
 
06:22:48.270 --> 06:22:48.280 align:start position:0%
and my two siblings sisters to be able
 
06:22:50.150 --> 06:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
to go and play in sports she was our
 
06:22:51.830 --> 06:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
assistant coach and coach in many of
 
06:22:51.840 --> 06:22:54.270 align:start position:0%
assistant coach and coach in many of
these

06:22:54.270 --> 06:22:54.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:56.590 --> 06:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
competitions I would also like to say
 
06:22:59.468 --> 06:22:59.478 align:start position:0%
that when I was training to become the
 
06:23:01.830 --> 06:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
state doubles champion in badman we had
 
06:23:04.350 --> 06:23:04.360 align:start position:0%
three boys who decided they wanted to
 
06:23:06.590 --> 06:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
join the team but they were not allowed
 
06:23:08.510 --> 06:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
to compete but they were great to
 
06:23:10.708 --> 06:23:10.718 align:start position:0%
practice with but I will tell you my
 
06:23:13.910 --> 06:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
partner and I we could not ever beat
 
06:23:16.590 --> 06:23:16.600 align:start position:0%
them even though we beat every other
 
06:23:19.830 --> 06:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
team in the state because of their
 
06:23:23.350 --> 06:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
physical and biological differences that
 
06:23:25.070 --> 06:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
made them much better than us and we
 
06:23:27.270 --> 06:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
could not beat them I would also like to
 
06:23:28.910 --> 06:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
point out that the New Hampshire inter
 
06:23:31.628 --> 06:23:31.638 align:start position:0%
Scholastic Athletic Association when
 
06:23:34.548 --> 06:23:34.558 align:start position:0%
they have their policy on uh trans
 
06:23:37.590 --> 06:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
participation is that someone who
 
06:23:40.548 --> 06:23:40.558 align:start position:0%
changes because of biological that the
 
06:23:44.030 --> 06:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
team um they're not allowed to um
 
06:23:46.788 --> 06:23:46.798 align:start position:0%
participate on that team for not for the
 
06:23:48.750 --> 06:23:48.760 align:start position:0%
purpose of gaining unfair advantage in
 
06:23:50.948 --> 06:23:50.958 align:start position:0%
competition so the New Hampshire
 
06:23:52.788 --> 06:23:52.798 align:start position:0%
Athletic Association already
 
06:23:54.390 --> 06:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
acknowledges there is an unfair
 
06:23:58.030 --> 06:23:58.040 align:start position:0%
advantage and that and one little story
 
06:23:59.510 --> 06:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
about my daughters when they were
 
06:24:02.510 --> 06:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
playing soccer um one of them I was 10
 
06:24:05.430 --> 06:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
years old and their coach took the
 
06:24:08.468 --> 06:24:08.478 align:start position:0%
entire team off the field because we
 
06:24:10.830 --> 06:24:10.840 align:start position:0%
were at that time we were playing mixed
 
06:24:13.230 --> 06:24:13.240 align:start position:0%
girls and boys and on the other team
 
06:24:15.628 --> 06:24:15.638 align:start position:0%
there were two boys that were much more
 
06:24:18.430 --> 06:24:18.440 align:start position:0%
advanced and we took and our coach took
 
06:24:20.830 --> 06:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
them off for fear of safety and that was
 
06:24:23.548 --> 06:24:23.558 align:start position:0%
at 10 years old and I will tell you that
 
06:24:26.510 --> 06:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
children are enter ing puberty earlier
 
06:24:30.830 --> 06:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
and earlier it is not 12 13 14 15

06:26:36.510 --> 06:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
orders my female and orders my female
 
06:26:39.390 --> 06:26:39.400 align:start position:0%
name my passport says I'm female and has
 
06:26:42.070 --> 06:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
my female name my insurance card says
 
06:26:44.590 --> 06:26:44.600 align:start position:0%
I'm female and has my female name my
 
06:26:47.590 --> 06:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
name is Iris and I'm female so when you
 
06:26:49.070 --> 06:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
think about these
 
06:26:51.350 --> 06:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
flws so when I think about these laws
 
06:26:53.948 --> 06:26:53.958 align:start position:0%
you are considering I feel so disgusted
 
06:26:56.750 --> 06:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
at Humanity's TR treatment um of
 
06:26:59.468 --> 06:26:59.478 align:start position:0%
transgender youth meaning Humanity's
 
06:27:04.708 --> 06:27:04.718 align:start position:0%
treatment of me for HB 125 what would
 
06:27:07.468 --> 06:27:07.478 align:start position:0%
could this mean for me I could try to
 
06:27:09.750 --> 06:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
play on girls teams I could try to use
 
06:27:12.110 --> 06:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
the girls bathroom still try to use the
 
06:27:14.750 --> 06:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
girls locker room because legal legally
 
06:27:17.628 --> 06:27:17.638 align:start position:0%
I'm female but these proposed laws say
 
06:27:20.110 --> 06:27:20.120 align:start position:0%
that me and my school could get sued for
 
06:27:22.110 --> 06:27:22.120 align:start position:0%
having the trans girl in girls teams or
 
06:27:24.310 --> 06:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
in girls bathrooms or in girls locker
 
06:27:26.910 --> 06:27:26.920 align:start position:0%
rooms I probably won't use the girls
 
06:27:29.150 --> 06:27:29.160 align:start position:0%
bathroom at school anymore because of
 
06:27:32.110 --> 06:27:32.120 align:start position:0%

across the state and I'm here to speak
 
06:29:48.708 --> 06:29:48.718 align:start position:0%
in opposition of HB 1205 related to
 
06:29:51.670 --> 06:29:51.680 align:start position:0%
women's School sports and I just want to
 
06:29:54.510 --> 06:29:54.520 align:start position:0%
make a couple of points aft proudly
 
06:29:56.750 --> 06:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
support courts Public Schools where all
 
06:30:00.070 --> 06:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
students feel safe welcome and that they
 
06:30:02.548 --> 06:30:02.558 align:start position:0%
belong all students not just most
 
06:30:04.350 --> 06:30:04.360 align:start position:0%
students but each and every single
 
06:30:06.670 --> 06:30:06.680 align:start position:0%
student and for that reason we oppose
 
06:30:08.430 --> 06:30:08.440 align:start position:0%
this bill for some students
 
06:30:10.070 --> 06:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
participating in sports is where they
 
06:30:11.670 --> 06:30:11.680 align:start position:0%
feel they most
 
06:30:13.910 --> 06:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
belong um it's a place where they are
 
06:30:15.788 --> 06:30:15.798 align:start position:0%
taught to work with a team a place where
 
06:30:17.948 --> 06:30:17.958 align:start position:0%
they Forge peer relationships with
 
06:30:20.350 --> 06:30:20.360 align:start position:0%
others their own age for most kids what
 
06:30:21.708 --> 06:30:21.718 align:start position:0%
they remember from their childhood
 
06:30:24.030 --> 06:30:24.040 align:start position:0%
Sports Experience is a lifelong
 
06:30:25.910 --> 06:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
friendships they make
 
06:30:25.920 --> 06:30:26.708 align:start position:0%
friendships they make
the

06:30:26.708 --> 06:30:26.718 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:30:29.590 --> 06:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
sportsmanship um learning the values
 
06:30:32.350 --> 06:30:32.360 align:start position:0%
that being on a team can
 
06:30:35.910 --> 06:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
teach so we do not want to deny that to
 
06:30:35.920 --> 06:30:38.110 align:start position:0%
teach so we do not want to deny that to
any

06:30:38.110 --> 06:30:38.120 align:start position:0%
any
 
06:30:40.270 --> 06:30:40.280 align:start position:0%
students in particular we do not want to
 
06:30:42.868 --> 06:30:42.878 align:start position:0%
deny that to transgender
 
06:30:47.670 --> 06:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
girls or any um group within our Public
 
06:30:49.910 --> 06:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
Schools another question another point I
 
06:30:53.628 --> 06:30:53.638 align:start position:0%
want to bring up is with this bill if it
 
06:30:55.750 --> 06:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
passes it's unclear how it will be
 
06:30:57.670 --> 06:30:57.680 align:start position:0%
enforced we don't keep birth
 
06:30:59.948 --> 06:30:59.958 align:start position:0%
certificates as part of the hum files at
 
06:31:03.110 --> 06:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
school and as we just heard from another
 
06:31:05.948 --> 06:31:05.958 align:start position:0%
testifier those birth certificates um
 
06:31:07.788 --> 06:31:07.798 align:start position:0%
can be legally
 
06:31:11.270 --> 06:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
changed so how are we going to determine
 
06:31:14.230 --> 06:31:14.240 align:start position:0%
what someone's biological sex
 
06:31:17.110 --> 06:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
is they may not be out to their school
 
06:31:18.990 --> 06:31:19.000 align:start position:0%
community and we also have a
 
06:31:21.430 --> 06:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
constitutional protection for privacy do
 
06:31:25.750 --> 06:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
you really want the school making
 
06:31:29.990 --> 06:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
intrusive inquiries into someone's past
 
06:31:31.548 --> 06:31:31.558 align:start position:0%
or medical
 
06:31:33.708 --> 06:31:33.718 align:start position:0%
situation I really don't want to be
 
06:31:36.270 --> 06:31:36.280 align:start position:0%
asking my members to be U making those
 
06:31:39.548 --> 06:31:39.558 align:start position:0%
kind of inquiries about what someone's
 
06:31:42.388 --> 06:31:42.398 align:start position:0%
biological sex is or what their uh
 
06:31:45.110 --> 06:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
gender was at Birth so that they can
 
06:31:48.310 --> 06:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
participate in a school activity for all
 
06:31:51.548 --> 06:31:51.558 align:start position:0%
those reasons and mostly because all of
 
06:31:53.948 --> 06:31:53.958 align:start position:0%
our students deserve to feel safe
 
06:31:55.628 --> 06:31:55.638 align:start position:0%

06:34:12.548 --> 06:34:12.558 align:start position:0%
is now 11 we frequently ski while school
 
06:34:14.788 --> 06:34:14.798 align:start position:0%
teams are practicing she asks about how
 
06:34:16.670 --> 06:34:16.680 align:start position:0%
fast they go and then she asks if she'll
 
06:34:18.110 --> 06:34:18.120 align:start position:0%
be able to race like that when she's
 
06:34:20.388 --> 06:34:20.398 align:start position:0%
older I tell her that of course she will
 
06:34:22.270 --> 06:34:22.280 align:start position:0%
knowing I will have to work so hard to
 
06:34:24.670 --> 06:34:24.680 align:start position:0%
make my words true my daughter daughter
 
06:34:27.070 --> 06:34:27.080 align:start position:0%
is a good has a good happy childhood but
 
06:34:29.350 --> 06:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
she does not have an easy one in second
 
06:34:31.070 --> 06:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
grade she was bullied for her gender so
 
06:34:33.230 --> 06:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
much that the ACLU and glad had to step
 
06:34:35.070 --> 06:34:35.080 align:start position:0%
in and our family had to move to keep
 
06:34:37.230 --> 06:34:37.240 align:start position:0%
her safe she lives with the knowledge
 
06:34:38.788 --> 06:34:38.798 align:start position:0%
that some people will not like her
 
06:34:41.070 --> 06:34:41.080 align:start position:0%
because of who she is she knows that her
 
06:34:43.388 --> 06:34:43.398 align:start position:0%
rights are never a given this is a lot
 
06:34:45.388 --> 06:34:45.398 align:start position:0%
for an 8-year-old or 11-year-old or
 
06:34:47.948 --> 06:34:47.958 align:start position:0%
anyone of any age to carry yet somehow
 
06:34:50.350 --> 06:34:50.360 align:start position:0%
Against All Odds my daughter continues
 
06:34:52.628 --> 06:34:52.638 align:start position:0%
to know that to be transgender is a rare
 
06:34:54.910 --> 06:34:54.920 align:start position:0%
but wonderful thing yeah my husband and
 
06:34:56.868 --> 06:34:56.878 align:start position:0%
I hold fast to all the areas where we
 
06:34:58.910 --> 06:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
see her confidence grow we don't just
 
06:35:01.030 --> 06:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
put money aside each year so she can ski
 
06:35:03.110 --> 06:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
because it's fun we do it because we
 
06:35:04.670 --> 06:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
know the statistics that result from
 
06:35:06.350 --> 06:35:06.360 align:start position:0%
living in a culture that tells her from
 
06:35:08.350 --> 06:35:08.360 align:start position:0%
so many angles that she is wrong
 
06:35:10.190 --> 06:35:10.200 align:start position:0%
different and unworthy and that
 
06:35:12.230 --> 06:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
something as simple as skiing could save
 
06:35:14.830 --> 06:35:14.840 align:start position:0%
her life my daughter is a girl she will
 
06:35:17.110 --> 06:35:17.120 align:start position:0%
not grow up to race with boys and to ask
 
06:35:18.910 --> 06:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
her to is an act of bullying and
 
06:35:20.990 --> 06:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
exclusion so before you vote I would
 
06:35:22.468 --> 06:35:22.478 align:start position:0%
urge you to imagine what it might be
 
06:35:24.190 --> 06:35:24.200 align:start position:0%
like to look into my daughter's eyes and
 
06:35:26.070 --> 06:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
to to tell her that no in fact she will
 
06:35:27.948 --> 06:35:27.958 align:start position:0%
not be allowed to race or play any sport
 
06:35:29.948 --> 06:35:29.958 align:start position:0%
when she is older because adults in her
 
06:35:31.270 --> 06:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
community believe there is something
 
06:35:33.590 --> 06:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
dangerous about her if you did that you
 
06:35:35.230 --> 06:35:35.240 align:start position:0%
would be forced to see how cruel this
 
06:35:38.548 --> 06:35:38.558 align:start position:0%
bill is I urge you to oppose HB 1205
 
06:35:40.868 --> 06:35:40.878 align:start position:0%
thank very much are there any questions
 
06:35:42.670 --> 06:35:42.680 align:start position:0%
from the committee thank you thank you
 
06:35:53.110 --> 06:35:53.120 align:start position:0%

low B
 
06:35:58.910 --> 06:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
sorry um thank you chairman lad and the
 
06:36:00.830 --> 06:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
rest of the educational
 
06:36:04.310 --> 06:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
committee uh everyone has stole my
 
06:36:07.190 --> 06:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
thunder uh but let me tell you where how
 
06:36:09.628 --> 06:36:09.638 align:start position:0%
this all began and I'll be
 
06:36:13.948 --> 06:36:13.958 align:start position:0%
brief uh back in July I asked our uh
 
06:36:15.750 --> 06:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
Board of Education representative in
 
06:36:18.110 --> 06:36:18.120 align:start position:0%
Newberry some questions with regard to
 
06:36:21.150 --> 06:36:21.160 align:start position:0%
the sports teams she refused to answer
 
06:36:24.830 --> 06:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
she sent me over to uh Mike
 
06:36:27.510 --> 06:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
betet the assistant superintendent of
 
06:36:30.670 --> 06:36:30.680 align:start position:0%
karge he and I have a stack of emails
 
06:36:33.468 --> 06:36:33.478 align:start position:0%
back and forth like this in the end here
 
06:36:35.750 --> 06:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
is the reason this bill is
 
06:36:40.590 --> 06:36:40.600 align:start position:0%
here uh he told me in the end that they
 
06:36:40.600 --> 06:36:41.548 align:start position:0%
here uh he told me in the end that they
may

06:36:41.548 --> 06:36:41.558 align:start position:0%
may
 
06:36:44.788 --> 06:36:44.798 align:start position:0%
discriminate gender identity point of
 
06:36:47.190 --> 06:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
Excuse me yes what's your point I that
 
06:36:51.150 --> 06:36:51.160 align:start position:0%
the last person that testified on Kar
 
06:36:54.468 --> 06:36:54.478 align:start position:0%
Sports gave personal information that
 
06:36:57.070 --> 06:36:57.080 align:start position:0%
the person identifiable and I don't want
 
06:36:59.110 --> 06:36:59.120 align:start position:0%
that to happen again so could you urge
 
06:37:02.868 --> 06:37:02.878 align:start position:0%
this person not to use terms about the
 
06:37:06.990 --> 06:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
person to make that person did you hear
 
06:37:09.030 --> 06:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
what she was saying not to use please
 
06:37:11.990 --> 06:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
don't use anyone's name it's right okay
 
06:37:12.000 --> 06:37:13.670 align:start position:0%
don't use anyone's name it's right okay
sorry

06:37:13.670 --> 06:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
06:37:16.350 --> 06:37:16.360 align:start position:0%
or Mr chair if I may bring a point of
 
06:37:18.030 --> 06:37:18.040 align:start position:0%
order on my own I believe the public has
 
06:37:20.030 --> 06:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
free speech and if a person is not
 
06:37:22.388 --> 06:37:22.398 align:start position:0%
protected by law there is no prohibition
 
06:37:25.830 --> 06:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
yep go ahead I'm just trying to tell you
 
06:37:30.190 --> 06:37:30.200 align:start position:0%
how this got here and um I was told if I
 
06:37:32.430 --> 06:37:32.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to change the law with regard to
 
06:37:35.190 --> 06:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
the sports activities that are
 
06:37:39.150 --> 06:37:39.160 align:start position:0%
happening at the school uh then we would
 
06:37:42.788 --> 06:37:42.798 align:start position:0%
have to change the law at the state so
 
06:37:45.590 --> 06:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
some of us got together we did a lot of
 
06:37:47.670 --> 06:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
research looked at all the bills that
 
06:37:49.628 --> 06:37:49.638 align:start position:0%
are passed in all the various other
 
06:37:53.190 --> 06:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
states we put it together as we felt
 
06:37:56.830 --> 06:37:56.840 align:start position:0%
best would represent New Hampshire and
 
06:38:00.510 --> 06:38:00.520 align:start position:0%
uh Louise Andress was the one that took
 
06:38:03.190 --> 06:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
up the sponsorship of the bill and we
 
06:38:06.708 --> 06:38:06.718 align:start position:0%
moved forward so here we are but I I
 
06:38:10.270 --> 06:38:10.280 align:start position:0%
have to say I participated in sports my
 
06:38:12.788 --> 06:38:12.798 align:start position:0%
two daughters participated in sports my
 
06:38:14.948 --> 06:38:14.958 align:start position:0%
two granddaughters participated in
 
06:38:17.548 --> 06:38:17.558 align:start position:0%
sports I have a science and financial
 
06:38:20.430 --> 06:38:20.440 align:start position:0%
background both educationally and
 
06:38:23.070 --> 06:38:23.080 align:start position:0%
professionally I can compete with men
 
06:38:26.270 --> 06:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
and I have been all my life but I'm
 
06:38:30.350 --> 06:38:30.360 align:start position:0%
competing with this up here I don't have
 
06:38:33.510 --> 06:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
to compete with this and girls right now
 
06:38:35.510 --> 06:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
are competing against
 
06:38:39.948 --> 06:38:39.958 align:start position:0%
trans women who have as other people
 
06:38:43.388 --> 06:38:43.398 align:start position:0%
have mentioned are much bigger stronger
 
06:38:48.310 --> 06:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
typically um so going forward uh in
 
06:38:50.670 --> 06:38:50.680 align:start position:0%
following what other states have done
 
06:38:54.270 --> 06:38:54.280 align:start position:0%
and what we can do here to solve this
 
06:38:56.990 --> 06:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
problem is maybe as others have said
 
06:38:57.000 --> 06:38:58.310 align:start position:0%
problem is maybe as others have said
have

06:38:58.310 --> 06:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
have
 
06:39:02.590 --> 06:39:02.600 align:start position:0%
co-ed uh sports teams whatever but when
 
06:39:06.110 --> 06:39:06.120 align:start position:0%
it comes to discrimination the few we
 
06:39:09.270 --> 06:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
worried about it's the many the female
 
06:39:11.670 --> 06:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
biological females who are being
 
06:39:14.468 --> 06:39:14.478 align:start position:0%
discriminated against and it needs to
 
06:39:16.388 --> 06:39:16.398 align:start position:0%
stop thank you very much other questions
 
06:39:18.310 --> 06:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
from the committee thank
 
06:39:23.030 --> 06:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:23.040 --> 06:39:35.628 align:start position:0%
 
sey

06:39:35.628 --> 06:39:35.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:37.350 --> 06:39:37.360 align:start position:0%

children's Behavioral Health policy
 
06:39:45.788 --> 06:39:45.798 align:start position:0%
coordinator at new Futures new Futures
 
06:39:47.990 --> 06:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
is a nonpartisan nonprofit organization

Granite saders um your future is here in
 
06:39:56.350 --> 06:39:56.360 align:start position:0%
strong opposition to house bille 125
 
06:39:58.510 --> 06:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
because transgender and nonbinary youth
 
06:40:00.230 --> 06:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
deserve the same opportunities as their
 
06:40:01.990 --> 06:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
peers to develop the social and
 
06:40:03.830 --> 06:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
emotional skills that come from playing
 
06:40:06.548 --> 06:40:06.558 align:start position:0%
sports um we all envision a New
 
06:40:08.350 --> 06:40:08.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that is safe and welcoming for
 
06:40:10.590 --> 06:40:10.600 align:start position:0%
our students and our children
 
06:40:12.948 --> 06:40:12.958 align:start position:0%
unfortunately House Bill 125 threatens
 
06:40:14.310 --> 06:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
this shared
 
06:40:17.270 --> 06:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
Vision um we know that when transgender
 
06:40:20.430 --> 06:40:20.440 align:start position:0%
youth are able to live their um lives as
 
06:40:23.388 --> 06:40:23.398 align:start position:0%
their preferred gender um they have
 
06:40:25.190 --> 06:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
mental health outcomes that are on par
 
06:40:26.270 --> 06:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
with their
 
06:40:28.750 --> 06:40:28.760 align:start position:0%
peers furthermore participation in
 
06:40:30.628 --> 06:40:30.638 align:start position:0%
sports lends itself to development of
 
06:40:32.468 --> 06:40:32.478 align:start position:0%
social skills such as leadership
 
06:40:35.830 --> 06:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
teamwork self-respect discipline skills
 
06:40:38.310 --> 06:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
that translate into successful lives
 
06:40:40.990 --> 06:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
both professionally and
 
06:40:44.350 --> 06:40:44.360 align:start position:0%
socially as such transgender students
 
06:40:46.310 --> 06:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
deserve the right to participate in
 
06:40:48.468 --> 06:40:48.478 align:start position:0%
sports develop these skills and have the
 
06:40:50.708 --> 06:40:50.718 align:start position:0%
mental health outcomes uh the same
 
06:40:53.030 --> 06:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
mental health outcomes as their peers
 
06:40:54.708 --> 06:40:54.718 align:start position:0%
for those reasons Futures urges the
 
06:40:56.270 --> 06:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
committee to vote itl on house bille
 
06:40:58.548 --> 06:40:58.558 align:start position:0%

06:41:27.788 --> 06:41:27.798 align:start position:0%
1205 one thing I love about living in
 
06:41:29.350 --> 06:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is that as a woman if I
 
06:41:31.190 --> 06:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
need help picking up something heavy or
 
06:41:33.910 --> 06:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
reaching something up high I can count
 
06:41:36.708 --> 06:41:36.718 align:start position:0%
on a man helping me it doesn't matter
 
06:41:39.430 --> 06:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
his age or his political party New
 
06:41:40.830 --> 06:41:40.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire men are
 
06:41:43.030 --> 06:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
chivalrous that makes it so much more
 
06:41:45.110 --> 06:41:45.120 align:start position:0%
confusing and painful when I see male
 
06:41:47.430 --> 06:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
legislators both Democrats and
 
06:41:50.190 --> 06:41:50.200 align:start position:0%
Republicans who support allowing ma
 
06:41:52.750 --> 06:41:52.760 align:start position:0%
males to compete in female
 
06:41:56.910 --> 06:41:56.920 align:start position:0%
sports they know men are taller bigger
 
06:41:59.110 --> 06:41:59.120 align:start position:0%
stronger they know males will dominate
 
06:42:02.230 --> 06:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
in female sports they know
 
06:42:04.788 --> 06:42:04.798 align:start position:0%
that male and female sports are
 
06:42:07.310 --> 06:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
segregated because of the large
 
06:42:10.750 --> 06:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
difference in size and strength they
 
06:42:13.708 --> 06:42:13.718 align:start position:0%
know that if Sports competitions were
 
06:42:16.430 --> 06:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
unisex that men would take virtually all
 
06:42:18.590 --> 06:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
the trophies in
 
06:42:20.910 --> 06:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
scholarships they know that women risk
 
06:42:23.830 --> 06:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
Serious injury in contact sports like
 
06:42:24.830 --> 06:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
soccer and
 
06:42:27.590 --> 06:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
volleyball they know that males changing
 
06:42:31.948 --> 06:42:31.958 align:start position:0%
in female locker rooms risks exposing
 
06:42:34.628 --> 06:42:34.638 align:start position:0%
females to naked male bodies which is a
 
06:42:37.230 --> 06:42:37.240 align:start position:0%
serious kind of sexual
 
06:42:39.948 --> 06:42:39.958 align:start position:0%
abuse they all they know all of this and
 
06:42:41.708 --> 06:42:41.718 align:start position:0%
yet they support allowing males to
 
06:42:44.750 --> 06:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
compete in female sports these men have
 
06:42:47.548 --> 06:42:47.558 align:start position:0%
joined the rush to affirm the totally
 
06:42:49.990 --> 06:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
unscientific belief that males can
 
06:42:53.110 --> 06:42:53.120 align:start position:0%
become females just by declaring they
 
06:42:56.468 --> 06:42:56.478 align:start position:0%
are it's Madness and they know it they
 
06:42:58.670 --> 06:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
will all be very sad a few years when
 
06:43:00.590 --> 06:43:00.600 align:start position:0%
they look back at all the Carnage and
 
06:43:02.388 --> 06:43:02.398 align:start position:0%
realize the serious harm that has been
 
06:43:05.190 --> 06:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
inflicted on female sports the Lost
 
06:43:08.350 --> 06:43:08.360 align:start position:0%
Awards the Lost scholarships the serious
 
06:43:11.590 --> 06:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
physical injuries the sexual abuse do
 
06:43:14.430 --> 06:43:14.440 align:start position:0%
these legislators think of their mothers
 
06:43:16.190 --> 06:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
their sisters their daughters their
 
06:43:18.590 --> 06:43:18.600 align:start position:0%
nieces when they vote on these bills
 
06:43:22.388 --> 06:43:22.398 align:start position:0%
please vote ought to pass on hb1 1205 to
 
06:43:24.670 --> 06:43:24.680 align:start position:0%
save women's sports thank you very much
 
06:43:26.548 --> 06:43:26.558 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
06:43:28.990 --> 06:43:29.000 align:start position:0%
committee thank
 
06:43:40.548 --> 06:43:40.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:43.150 --> 06:43:43.160 align:start position:0%
Brennan good afternoon thank you for
 
06:43:44.468 --> 06:43:44.478 align:start position:0%
hearing me
 
06:43:51.070 --> 06:43:51.080 align:start position:0%
today I am speaking in opposition to hb1
 
06:43:54.310 --> 06:43:54.320 align:start position:0%
1205 I did want to mention that I played
 
06:43:57.388 --> 06:43:57.398 align:start position:0%
uh basketball when I was in high school
 
06:43:59.548 --> 06:43:59.558 align:start position:0%
and I've made much of my living as an
 
06:44:03.388 --> 06:44:03.398 align:start position:0%
adult as a circus performer um beating
 
06:44:07.350 --> 06:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
out boys for the strength roles I was
 
06:44:10.750 --> 06:44:10.760 align:start position:0%
born with a bulba and I developed
 
06:44:15.910 --> 06:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
breasts during um uh puberty so I'm a
 
06:44:17.750 --> 06:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
cisgender woman going through menopause
 
06:44:19.948 --> 06:44:19.958 align:start position:0%
so I'm losing some of that strength um
 
06:44:22.388 --> 06:44:22.398 align:start position:0%
so I'm generally in opposition to laws
 
06:44:25.510 --> 06:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
that uphold the extermin a of minorities
 
06:44:30.750 --> 06:44:30.760 align:start position:0%
and uh this hb1 1205 is a bite into the
 
06:44:34.590 --> 06:44:34.600 align:start position:0%
pursuit of happiness of trans kids uh
 
06:44:36.990 --> 06:44:37.000 align:start position:0%
next to come will be another crunch into
 
06:44:39.628 --> 06:44:39.638 align:start position:0%
the liberty of trans kids and adults and
 
06:44:41.990 --> 06:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
the main course or the final solution
 
06:44:45.990 --> 06:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
and yes I intentionally capitalize final
 
06:44:49.190 --> 06:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
solution is a drooling snarling Chomp
 
06:44:51.430 --> 06:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
that ends the lives of all trans people
 
06:44:54.310 --> 06:44:54.320 align:start position:0%
in this state and the nation
 
06:44:56.150 --> 06:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
people who can sit and listen to the
 
06:44:59.110 --> 06:44:59.120 align:start position:0%
testimony of actual trans people and
 
06:45:01.468 --> 06:45:01.478 align:start position:0%
stand on the side of this bill I really
 
06:45:04.190 --> 06:45:04.200 align:start position:0%
question uh their taste in
 
06:45:07.230 --> 06:45:07.240 align:start position:0%
judgment uh Ohio and other states
 
06:45:09.750 --> 06:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned the 24 that have passed these
 
06:45:12.948 --> 06:45:12.958 align:start position:0%
bills they follow them up uh moving on
 
06:45:16.190 --> 06:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
to access to health care for kids moving
 
06:45:18.910 --> 06:45:18.920 align:start position:0%
on to access for healthare for
 
06:45:22.548 --> 06:45:22.558 align:start position:0%
adults then they move on to bathroom use
 
06:45:24.430 --> 06:45:24.440 align:start position:0%
public bathrooms
 
06:45:27.868 --> 06:45:27.878 align:start position:0%
employment and visibility in
 
06:45:32.910 --> 06:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
public the safety issue here isn't
 
06:45:35.910 --> 06:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
largely that someone's CIS daughter is
 
06:45:38.110 --> 06:45:38.120 align:start position:0%
going to lose out to a trans girl in
 
06:45:40.310 --> 06:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
sports statistically the data isn't
 
06:45:42.190 --> 06:45:42.200 align:start position:0%
there and I have that here I'll give it
 
06:45:44.510 --> 06:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
to you so you can check it out um and it
 
06:45:46.670 --> 06:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
isn't that she's going to be ruined for
 
06:45:48.590 --> 06:45:48.600 align:start position:0%
life by seeing a trans girl's penis in
 
06:45:51.030 --> 06:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
the locker room in fact statistically
 
06:45:54.230 --> 06:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
that won't be the first penis she sees
 
06:45:56.230 --> 06:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
the safety issue is a straight and
 
06:45:58.750 --> 06:45:58.760 align:start position:0%
narrow path to elimination of minorities
 
06:46:00.990 --> 06:46:01.000 align:start position:0%
trans people queer people disabled
 
06:46:03.230 --> 06:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
people Jewish people black people brown
 
06:46:05.990 --> 06:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
people and a tightening definition of
 
06:46:09.430 --> 06:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
what is acceptable as man woman and
 
06:46:11.948 --> 06:46:11.958 align:start position:0%
human the slippery slope is toward a
 
06:46:13.548 --> 06:46:13.558 align:start position:0%
future where everyone is looking over
 
06:46:15.150 --> 06:46:15.160 align:start position:0%
their shoulder as they point at each
 
06:46:16.670 --> 06:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
other trying to save themselves from
 
06:46:19.868 --> 06:46:19.878 align:start position:0%
being masticated out of existence by
 
06:46:22.628 --> 06:46:22.638 align:start position:0%
fascism minutes is up please see the
 
06:46:25.830 --> 06:46:25.840 align:start position:0%

on Thursday to prove my point and please
 
06:46:32.548 --> 06:46:32.558 align:start position:0%

Chris

06:46:47.310 --> 06:46:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:49.350 --> 06:46:49.360 align:start position:0%
urel thank you chairman thank you
 
06:46:51.190 --> 06:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh my name is
 
06:46:53.628 --> 06:46:53.638 align:start position:0%
Chris urel I'm an attorney at glad I
 
06:46:56.270 --> 06:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
testified in this Committee Against uh
 
06:46:58.468 --> 06:46:58.478 align:start position:0%
similar bills um many times and I'm here
 
06:47:00.910 --> 06:47:00.920 align:start position:0%
to testify against this one as well uh
 
06:47:03.030 --> 06:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
others have testified eloquently about
 
06:47:04.910 --> 06:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
the important educational opportunities
 
06:47:07.948 --> 06:47:07.958 align:start position:0%
the essential life skills that Sports
 
06:47:10.750 --> 06:47:10.760 align:start position:0%
bring to a child's life which uh you
 
06:47:12.468 --> 06:47:12.478 align:start position:0%
know uh communication teamwork
 
06:47:13.830 --> 06:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
self-discipline leadership confidence
 
06:47:15.270 --> 06:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
these are essential life skills that
 
06:47:17.830 --> 06:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
should not be denied to any student and
 
06:47:19.430 --> 06:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh fortunately federal and state law
 
06:47:21.350 --> 06:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
protects every student's right to get
 
06:47:23.590 --> 06:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
those skills and to every other equal
 
06:47:26.150 --> 06:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
Educational Opportunity um I do want to
 
06:47:29.230 --> 06:47:29.240 align:start position:0%
point out that it is an absolute myth
 
06:47:31.510 --> 06:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
and it's an egregious and offensive myth
 
06:47:33.830 --> 06:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
to suggest that transgender people are
 
06:47:36.150 --> 06:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
unsafe when there is no evidence to
 
06:47:38.310 --> 06:47:38.320 align:start position:0%
support that claim transgender people
 
06:47:41.270 --> 06:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
are not unsafe and measures to improve
 
06:47:43.468 --> 06:47:43.478 align:start position:0%
safety in school sports should be
 
06:47:45.708 --> 06:47:45.718 align:start position:0%
prioritized excluding trans people does
 
06:47:48.510 --> 06:47:48.520 align:start position:0%
nothing to further that goal I could go
 
06:47:51.030 --> 06:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
into great detail talking about Title 9
 
06:47:53.310 --> 06:47:53.320 align:start position:0%
and how it conflicts with this bill and
 
06:47:54.868 --> 06:47:54.878 align:start position:0%
what this bill would do to New Hampshire
 
06:47:58.110 --> 06:47:58.120 align:start position:0%
law um as many of you probably know in
 
06:48:01.030 --> 06:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
2020 the US Supreme Court decided a case
 
06:48:04.510 --> 06:48:04.520 align:start position:0%
BTO in which they said that uh sex
 
06:48:06.548 --> 06:48:06.558 align:start position:0%
includes uh discri discrimination based
 
06:48:08.430 --> 06:48:08.440 align:start position:0%
on sex includes discrimination based on
 
06:48:11.070 --> 06:48:11.080 align:start position:0%
transgender status uh and Title Nine has
 
06:48:12.350 --> 06:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
been interpreted by the federal
 
06:48:13.910 --> 06:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
government to preclude discrimination
 
06:48:15.868 --> 06:48:15.878 align:start position:0%
based on transgender status if New
 
06:48:18.110 --> 06:48:18.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law and federal law are in
 
06:48:20.070 --> 06:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
Conflict that's going to create a lot of
 
06:48:21.510 --> 06:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
problem for New Hampshire schools and
 
06:48:22.788 --> 06:48:22.798 align:start position:0%
for the Human Rights Commission I'm
 
06:48:24.388 --> 06:48:24.398 align:start position:0%
happy to talk about that in more detail
 
06:48:26.670 --> 06:48:26.680 align:start position:0%
including about the litigation uh that's
 
06:48:28.548 --> 06:48:28.558 align:start position:0%
ongoing across the country in states
 
06:48:31.468 --> 06:48:31.478 align:start position:0%
where similar bands have happened um I
 
06:48:31.478 --> 06:48:32.310 align:start position:0%
where similar bands have happened um I
want

06:48:32.310 --> 06:48:32.320 align:start position:0%
want
 
06:48:35.310 --> 06:48:35.320 align:start position:0%
to make a point that there are policy
 
06:48:37.750 --> 06:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
experts who have made policies across uh
 
06:48:40.070 --> 06:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
you know every Sports every aspect of
 
06:48:41.548 --> 06:48:41.558 align:start position:0%
sports including the international
 
06:48:43.868 --> 06:48:43.878 align:start position:0%
Olympics committee the NCAA every
 
06:48:45.910 --> 06:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
professional sports organization and of
 
06:48:47.310 --> 06:48:47.320 align:start position:0%
course the New Hampshire in Scholastic
 
06:48:49.070 --> 06:48:49.080 align:start position:0%
Athletics Association that govern
 
06:48:52.150 --> 06:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
fairness and sports and uh policy
 
06:48:53.830 --> 06:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
experts have been involved in making
 
06:48:55.708 --> 06:48:55.718 align:start position:0%
every single one of these determinations
 
06:48:57.430 --> 06:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
it's not the legislator's role to get
 
06:49:01.990 --> 06:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
involved um so there's uh there's
 
06:49:03.430 --> 06:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
there's there's eight states where
 
06:49:05.070 --> 06:49:05.080 align:start position:0%
litigation has been happening and I just
 
06:49:06.948 --> 06:49:06.958 align:start position:0%
want to point out that in the majority
 
06:49:08.910 --> 06:49:08.920 align:start position:0%
of those States courts have ruled that
 
06:49:11.628 --> 06:49:11.638 align:start position:0%
banss on the participation in athletics
 
06:49:13.910 --> 06:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
um for transgender youth are
 
06:49:15.548 --> 06:49:15.558 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and in violation of
 
06:49:18.110 --> 06:49:18.120 align:start position:0%
Title 9 and uh I have more specific
 
06:49:19.350 --> 06:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
details if anybody's interested in
 
06:49:20.750 --> 06:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
hearing them thank you thank you very
 
06:49:22.830 --> 06:49:22.840 align:start position:0%
much are there questions from committee
 
06:49:24.830 --> 06:49:24.840 align:start position:0%
yes representa Tanner thank you and
 
06:49:28.388 --> 06:49:28.398 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um I
 
06:49:29.910 --> 06:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
noticed that at the end of this bill
 
06:49:33.468 --> 06:49:33.478 align:start position:0%
there's a Ser severability Clause uh
 
06:49:35.910 --> 06:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
which I've seen every once in a while in
 
06:49:38.708 --> 06:49:38.718 align:start position:0%
other bills and it always flags for me
 
06:49:41.510 --> 06:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
that uh the people that wrote this
 
06:49:43.670 --> 06:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
understand that parts of this bill are
 
06:49:46.548 --> 06:49:46.558 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and uh that they don't
 
06:49:48.430 --> 06:49:48.440 align:start position:0%
want the whole bill to be down the trash
 
06:49:51.590 --> 06:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
can because of unconstitutionality so
 
06:49:53.868 --> 06:49:53.878 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if you could just uh maybe
 
06:49:55.628 --> 06:49:55.638 align:start position:0%
talk about a couple things in this bill
 
06:49:58.388 --> 06:49:58.398 align:start position:0%
that are unconstitutional and give us
 
06:50:01.190 --> 06:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
some specifics on the court cases yeah
 
06:50:03.788 --> 06:50:03.798 align:start position:0%
absolutely um so the New Hampshire state
 
06:50:05.670 --> 06:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
constitution in addition to the United
 
06:50:09.750 --> 06:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
States Constitution both uh both uh
 
06:50:11.628 --> 06:50:11.638 align:start position:0%
promise equal protection of the laws to
 
06:50:13.750 --> 06:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
all people uh in the federal government
 
06:50:15.230 --> 06:50:15.240 align:start position:0%
in the federal context that has been
 
06:50:17.430 --> 06:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
interpreted by courts to mean that
 
06:50:19.868 --> 06:50:19.878 align:start position:0%
people regardless of the regardless of
 
06:50:22.190 --> 06:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
their uh inherent characteristics are
 
06:50:23.548 --> 06:50:23.558 align:start position:0%
entitled to equal protection of the laws
 
06:50:24.750 --> 06:50:24.760 align:start position:0%
which means they can't be faced
 
06:50:26.190 --> 06:50:26.200 align:start position:0%
discrimination in the way that laws are
 
06:50:30.110 --> 06:50:30.120 align:start position:0%
written same is true for um laws um in
 
06:50:32.750 --> 06:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh and sex of course is
 
06:50:34.628 --> 06:50:34.638 align:start position:0%
has long been considered a protected
 
06:50:37.070 --> 06:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
classification under federal and state
 
06:50:38.670 --> 06:50:38.680 align:start position:0%
law when it comes to interpreting the
 
06:50:41.430 --> 06:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
protections and constitutions uh courts
 
06:50:44.190 --> 06:50:44.200 align:start position:0%
have pretty uniformly agreed that
 
06:50:46.990 --> 06:50:47.000 align:start position:0%
transgender people uh because the
 
06:50:47.830 --> 06:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
because the difference between
 
06:50:49.030 --> 06:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
transgender people and people who are
 
06:50:50.430 --> 06:50:50.440 align:start position:0%
not transgender is a sex-based
 
06:50:52.190 --> 06:50:52.200 align:start position:0%
difference that they're entitled to the
 
06:50:54.590 --> 06:50:54.600 align:start position:0%
Protections in the Constitution um both
 
06:50:56.270 --> 06:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
the state and federal Constitution and
 
06:50:58.548 --> 06:50:58.558 align:start position:0%
so uh we've seen litigation in many
 
06:51:00.510 --> 06:51:00.520 align:start position:0%
states and I actually I think it's
 
06:51:01.830 --> 06:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
really interesting that two states in
 
06:51:04.948 --> 06:51:04.958 align:start position:0%
particular uh Utah and Montana their
 
06:51:07.590 --> 06:51:07.600 align:start position:0%
Sports bans have been overturned or held
 
06:51:09.548 --> 06:51:09.558 align:start position:0%
to be unconstitutional based on the
 
06:51:11.230 --> 06:51:11.240 align:start position:0%
state constitution as opposed to based
 
06:51:13.350 --> 06:51:13.360 align:start position:0%
on the Federal Constitution so and and
 
06:51:15.190 --> 06:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
so I just think it's really interesting
 
06:51:17.548 --> 06:51:17.558 align:start position:0%
that uh courts around the country are
 
06:51:19.948 --> 06:51:19.958 align:start position:0%
interpreting uh interpreting the way
 
06:51:23.230 --> 06:51:23.240 align:start position:0%
that uh the equal protection analysis
 
06:51:26.548 --> 06:51:26.558 align:start position:0%
works is to operate in support of trans
 
06:51:28.110 --> 06:51:28.120 align:start position:0%
students ability to play sports and I
 
06:51:29.548 --> 06:51:29.558 align:start position:0%
mean there's really good reason for that
 
06:51:31.030 --> 06:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
there's absolutely no basis as we've
 
06:51:32.708 --> 06:51:32.718 align:start position:0%
heard there's absolutely no basis for
 
06:51:34.628 --> 06:51:34.638 align:start position:0%
saying that a 12-year-old transgender
 
06:51:36.110 --> 06:51:36.120 align:start position:0%
girl who's never experienced male
 
06:51:39.350 --> 06:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
puberty is has some some fairness or
 
06:51:41.670 --> 06:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
safety advantage over over any other
 
06:51:43.230 --> 06:51:43.240 align:start position:0%
girl there's absolutely no basis for
 
06:51:44.948 --> 06:51:44.958 align:start position:0%
making that claim and so a law that
 
06:51:46.708 --> 06:51:46.718 align:start position:0%
would preclude a 12-year-old transgender
 
06:51:48.788 --> 06:51:48.798 align:start position:0%
girl who has never had male puberty from
 
06:51:50.350 --> 06:51:50.360 align:start position:0%
participating with other girls is
 
06:51:52.990 --> 06:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
clearly just targeted at excluding her
 
06:51:54.590 --> 06:51:54.600 align:start position:0%
for for no other reason than because she
 
06:51:57.590 --> 06:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
is transgender and so um building off of
 
06:52:00.150 --> 06:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
that I mean again we have uh Sports
 
06:52:02.590 --> 06:52:02.600 align:start position:0%
organizations that make policies that
 
06:52:05.430 --> 06:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
that uh are are there to ensure fairness
 
06:52:07.548 --> 06:52:07.558 align:start position:0%
and full participation to the maximum
 
06:52:09.270 --> 06:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
extent which is a goal that all of us
 
06:52:11.750 --> 06:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
should want and a law like this targets
 
06:52:13.468 --> 06:52:13.478 align:start position:0%
transgender people puts them in a
 
06:52:15.150 --> 06:52:15.160 align:start position:0%
different class and separates them and
 
06:52:17.708 --> 06:52:17.718 align:start position:0%
says that regardless of what uh what
 
06:52:19.590 --> 06:52:19.600 align:start position:0%
their bodies are like or regardless of
 
06:52:21.868 --> 06:52:21.878 align:start position:0%
what uh they would bring to a team
 
06:52:24.270 --> 06:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
they're still um excluded and and a
 
06:52:28.150 --> 06:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
follow up on that please yes um have you
 
06:52:31.590 --> 06:52:31.600 align:start position:0%
is there any law uh that youve heard of
 
06:52:36.750 --> 06:52:36.760 align:start position:0%
that's like this only for um trans uh
 
06:52:39.948 --> 06:52:39.958 align:start position:0%
boys I've never seen a any bill that's
 
06:52:41.230 --> 06:52:41.240 align:start position:0%
been directed specifically at
 
06:52:42.830 --> 06:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
transgender boys there are bills that
 
06:52:44.750 --> 06:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
say transgender girls and transgender
 
06:52:46.910 --> 06:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
boys can be are both going to be
 
06:52:48.150 --> 06:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
excluded from playing on teams
 
06:52:50.788 --> 06:52:50.798 align:start position:0%
consistent with their gender identity um
 
06:52:52.150 --> 06:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
but yeah I mean there's actually an
 
06:52:54.868 --> 06:52:54.878 align:start position:0%
interesting documentary so featuring
 
06:52:56.350 --> 06:52:56.360 align:start position:0%
Sarah huckman who's a transgender girl
 
06:52:58.468 --> 06:52:58.478 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire but also featuring a
 
06:53:00.548 --> 06:53:00.558 align:start position:0%
a young man named Mike bags who is a
 
06:53:03.190 --> 06:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
transgender young man in Texas and when
 
06:53:04.670 --> 06:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
he was in high school he was a wrestling
 
06:53:07.230 --> 06:53:07.240 align:start position:0%
star right but because of the way Texas
 
06:53:09.830 --> 06:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
law operated he wasn't allowed to play
 
06:53:12.468 --> 06:53:12.478 align:start position:0%
uh um on the men's team and so he was
 
06:53:15.990 --> 06:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
forced to wrestle against women and he
 
06:53:18.190 --> 06:53:18.200 align:start position:0%
uh of course dominated the sport in a
 
06:53:20.430 --> 06:53:20.440 align:start position:0%
way that was uh that was unfair to other
 
06:53:23.310 --> 06:53:23.320 align:start position:0%
women who are participating and
 
06:53:25.830 --> 06:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
um and all he wanted to do was wrestle
 
06:53:27.030 --> 06:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
and all he wanted to do was play on the
 
06:53:28.830 --> 06:53:28.840 align:start position:0%
boys team but the state wouldn't let him
 
06:53:30.788 --> 06:53:30.798 align:start position:0%
and so I think uh that raises some
 
06:53:32.788 --> 06:53:32.798 align:start position:0%
interesting questions about how a law
 
06:53:34.190 --> 06:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
like this actually undermines the very
 
06:53:36.628 --> 06:53:36.638 align:start position:0%
Norms that uh sex separation and sports
 
06:53:40.230 --> 06:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
are intended to uh to to further so this
 
06:53:42.910 --> 06:53:42.920 align:start position:0%
was a boy see follow follow because so
 
06:53:44.590 --> 06:53:44.600 align:start position:0%
this was a boy that was taking
 
06:53:46.388 --> 06:53:46.398 align:start position:0%
testosterone yeah it was a boy who was
 
06:53:48.190 --> 06:53:48.200 align:start position:0%
taking test thank you very much
 
06:53:48.200 --> 06:53:49.150 align:start position:0%
taking test thank you very much
represent

06:53:49.150 --> 06:53:49.160 align:start position:0%
represent
 
06:53:51.388 --> 06:53:51.398 align:start position:0%
Bel thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
06:53:55.110 --> 06:53:55.120 align:start position:0%
your testimony um can you tell us what
 
06:53:57.310 --> 06:53:57.320 align:start position:0%
federal court has ruled um in such a
 
06:53:59.030 --> 06:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
manner against the law such as this in
 
06:54:00.948 --> 06:54:00.958 align:start position:0%
accordance with title line yeah I mean
 
06:54:03.230 --> 06:54:03.240 align:start position:0%
the most um the most notable case is the
 
06:54:04.910 --> 06:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
ninth Circuit Court of Appeals which
 
06:54:07.670 --> 06:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
upheld uh the determination of an Idaho
 
06:54:09.150 --> 06:54:09.160 align:start position:0%
District Court Judge federal district
 
06:54:11.990 --> 06:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
court judge ruling that um that the that
 
06:54:16.030 --> 06:54:16.040 align:start position:0%
a sports ban was uh was in violation of
 
06:54:19.350 --> 06:54:19.360 align:start position:0%
um um sorry in violation of the US
 
06:54:22.388 --> 06:54:22.398 align:start position:0%
Constitution and uh you know also there
 
06:54:24.670 --> 06:54:24.680 align:start position:0%
are other courts Arizona a Federal Court
 
06:54:26.190 --> 06:54:26.200 align:start position:0%
ruled that it violates the US
 
06:54:28.230 --> 06:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
Constitution in Title 9 like I said the
 
06:54:30.190 --> 06:54:30.200 align:start position:0%
Utah and Montana courts were state
 
06:54:33.430 --> 06:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
courts um Indiana there was a a
 
06:54:34.910 --> 06:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
successful challenge in federal court
 
06:54:37.190 --> 06:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
that ended up getting mooded because a
 
06:54:38.990 --> 06:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
kid who has a plan of graduated so no
 
06:54:43.070 --> 06:54:43.080 align:start position:0%
longer had standing so that um so uh in
 
06:54:45.788 --> 06:54:45.798 align:start position:0%
West Virginia a judge blocked a case
 
06:54:48.030 --> 06:54:48.040 align:start position:0%
temporarily from or blocked a similar
 
06:54:51.030 --> 06:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
law temporarily from going into effect
 
06:54:52.868 --> 06:54:52.878 align:start position:0%
um but that hasn't been that case hasn't
 
06:54:54.948 --> 06:54:54.958 align:start position:0%
been concluded and it's up on appeal now
 
06:54:57.270 --> 06:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
in the fourth circuit similarly um
 
06:54:59.110 --> 06:54:59.120 align:start position:0%
there's a case that's in a bance in
 
06:55:02.548 --> 06:55:02.558 align:start position:0%
Tennessee uh in federal court because of
 
06:55:03.830 --> 06:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
um other cases that have been ongoing
 
06:55:05.670 --> 06:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
and there's no ruling in that case and
 
06:55:07.310 --> 06:55:07.320 align:start position:0%
if I may for clarification to follow up
 
06:55:10.230 --> 06:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
on that um the highest court then that
 
06:55:12.510 --> 06:55:12.520 align:start position:0%
is ruled on this is the ninth Circuit of
 
06:55:14.590 --> 06:55:14.600 align:start position:0%
California um it's not the ninth Circuit
 
06:55:16.310 --> 06:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
of California it's the ninth Circuit
 
06:55:17.590 --> 06:55:17.600 align:start position:0%
Court of Appeals for the United States
 
06:55:19.628 --> 06:55:19.638 align:start position:0%
of America right but it it covers
 
06:55:20.948 --> 06:55:20.958 align:start position:0%
California and the Western District
 
06:55:23.430 --> 06:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
mostly correct it covers this case arose
 
06:55:27.590 --> 06:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
in Idaho okay but not being under the um
 
06:55:29.468 --> 06:55:29.478 align:start position:0%
the ninth circuit and absent a
 
06:55:31.388 --> 06:55:31.398 align:start position:0%
nationwide injunction am I correct that
 
06:55:33.350 --> 06:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
a ruling out of the ninth circuit has no
 
06:55:35.030 --> 06:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
legal effect in New Hampshire I wouldn't
 
06:55:37.110 --> 06:55:37.120 align:start position:0%
say has no legal effect it uh you know
 
06:55:39.548 --> 06:55:39.558 align:start position:0%
has persuasive effect on any any any
 
06:55:41.510 --> 06:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court in the country uh that's
 
06:55:43.310 --> 06:55:43.320 align:start position:0%
not to say that other courts might
 
06:55:44.868 --> 06:55:44.878 align:start position:0%
disregard what the ninth circuit
 
06:55:47.150 --> 06:55:47.160 align:start position:0%
determined and the first circuit has not
 
06:55:49.510 --> 06:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
heard a case about whether or not uh
 
06:55:51.030 --> 06:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
discrimination against trans people in

membership um I hadn't planned to speak
 
06:56:30.070 --> 06:56:30.080 align:start position:0%
but given what I see as the devastating
 
06:56:32.548 --> 06:56:32.558 align:start position:0%
potential impact of this bill and the
 
06:56:34.708 --> 06:56:34.718 align:start position:0%
harm that it can cause I want to make
 
06:56:37.270 --> 06:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
sure that I am on the record and that
 
06:56:40.230 --> 06:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
Ken Street Coalition is on the record
 
06:56:43.708 --> 06:56:43.718 align:start position:0%
very publicly that we oppose this bill
 
06:56:47.350 --> 06:56:47.360 align:start position:0%
um because of the harm it it can cause
 
06:56:51.388 --> 06:56:51.398 align:start position:0%
and I would just state that um between
 
06:56:54.110 --> 06:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
1913 in
 
06:56:59.548 --> 06:56:59.558 align:start position:0%
1948 30 of 48 states enforced anti-
 
06:56:59.558 --> 06:57:01.548 align:start position:0%
1948 30 of 48 states enforced anti-
misation

06:57:01.548 --> 06:57:01.558 align:start position:0%
misation
 
06:57:05.750 --> 06:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
laws that did not make those laws right
 
06:57:08.030 --> 06:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
there is nothing about the fact that
 
06:57:10.868 --> 06:57:10.878 align:start position:0%
there were 30 states that did that that
 
06:57:14.430 --> 06:57:14.440 align:start position:0%
made that okay there is nothing right
 
06:57:18.070 --> 06:57:18.080 align:start position:0%
about this proposed law it doesn't
 
06:57:20.788 --> 06:57:20.798 align:start position:0%
matter how many other states have
 
06:57:23.830 --> 06:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
similar laws New Hampshire has always
 
06:57:26.670 --> 06:57:26.680 align:start position:0%
been a leader not a
 
06:57:31.070 --> 06:57:31.080 align:start position:0%
follower up to now I've been very proud
 
06:57:34.868 --> 06:57:34.878 align:start position:0%
of how our state has resisted this
 
06:57:37.628 --> 06:57:37.638 align:start position:0%
direction that seems to have overtaken
 
06:57:42.548 --> 06:57:42.558 align:start position:0%
the country I urge you to lead the way
 
06:57:45.788 --> 06:57:45.798 align:start position:0%
and not follow and to lead with
 
06:57:48.468 --> 06:57:48.478 align:start position:0%
compassion thank you so much thank you
 
06:57:50.030 --> 06:57:50.040 align:start position:0%

06:57:53.030 --> 06:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much
 
06:57:54.788 --> 06:57:54.798 align:start position:0%

06:58:21.320 --> 06:58:23.430 align:start position:0%
