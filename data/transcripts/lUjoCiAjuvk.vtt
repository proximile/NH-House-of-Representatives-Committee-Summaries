yes um i think this is a very very
 
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
important bill
 
00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
it needs to pass in the current form
 
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
it the wording is so loose that many
 
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
many people
 
00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:36.639 align:start position:0%
are interpreting it as a euthanasia bill
 
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
there's several places we can fix the
 
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
wording so that it's much more
 
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
clear and it retains the rights
 
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 align:start position:0%

you mr chairman i'm very
 
00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
concerned that there has been a very
 
00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
concerted last minute effort
 
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
on this bill which has been worked on by
 
00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:18.639 align:start position:0%
many many people
 
00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:21.919 align:start position:0%
the identification of it as a euthanasia

bill
 
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 align:start position:0%

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.029 align:start position:0%
is simply incorrect because there's a
specific

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
statement in the bill stating
 
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
that nothing in this bill authorizes
 
00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.790 align:start position:0%
that nothing in this bill authorizes
that

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
the other concerns that i have heard
 
00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
with it
 
00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
is that it is too complicated and of
 
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
course it is
 
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
complicated because end-of-life issues
 
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
are always
 
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
complicated for all of us
 
00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
it says that it excessively loosens end
 
00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:52.479 align:start position:0%
of decision
 
00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:54.639 align:start position:0%

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
does not
 
00:06:59.029 --> 00:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
uh it allows people
 
00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
to make their own choices for themselves
 
00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:05.759 align:start position:0%
and in the event that they have not done
 
00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:06.870 align:start position:0%
and in the event that they have not done
so

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
uh they it it
 
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
has a framework for making sure that the
 
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.029 align:start position:0%
has a framework for making sure that the
nearest

00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
nearest
 
00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:18.479 align:start position:0%
and dearest to them have a voice
 
00:07:21.589 --> 00:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
in what happens to them obviously
 
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
if that doesn't you know if there is
 
00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:27.919 align:start position:0%
if there is dissension or if there's
 
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:31.360 align:start position:0%
concern about whose making the decisions
 
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
there's always a court proceeding but
 
00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
it says it inappropriately authorizes
 
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
new players well no it doesn't these are
 
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
the same players that are involved in
 
00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
these decisions anyway
 
00:07:52.469 --> 00:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
and then concerns about
 
00:07:54.869 --> 00:07:54.879 align:start position:0%
lacks any clear opt-out provision well
 
00:07:57.029 --> 00:07:57.039 align:start position:0%
there's a very clear opt-out provision
 
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
you simply do your own directive
 
00:08:03.029 --> 00:08:03.039 align:start position:0%
and tell people exactly what you want
 
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:05.360 align:start position:0%
and exactly who you want involved in the
 
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
decision making process
 
00:08:10.469 --> 00:08:10.479 align:start position:0%
so i think this is a very important bill
 
00:08:11.029 --> 00:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
it is a
 
00:08:14.469 --> 00:08:14.479 align:start position:0%
very well thought out bill i think it is
 
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
very unfortunate that people who did not
 
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:17.830 align:start position:0%
very unfortunate that people who did not
come

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
come
 
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
to any to the or hearing or
 
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
start any kind of opposition until
 
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
over the weekend um are
 
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
are working hard to torpedo the work
 
00:08:32.389 --> 00:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
that's been done already so
 
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
i am hoping that a motion of
 
00:08:40.149 --> 00:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
ought to pass may be brought if the
 
00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:43.919 align:start position:0%
retention is overturned thank you
 
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
who else has a handout representative
 
00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:51.269 align:start position:0%
who else has a handout representative

woods
 
00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr chair
 
00:08:59.110 --> 00:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
um i'm a co-sponsor on this bill as you
 
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
can see
 
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
um i've been involved with this uh
 
00:09:06.949 --> 00:09:06.959 align:start position:0%
in many dimensions over um since the 60s
 
00:09:06.959 --> 00:09:08.550 align:start position:0%
in many dimensions over um since the 60s
basically

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
as a house officer i was thrust into
 
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
position on a couple of times when i
 
00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
worked in the intensive care unit
 
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
where there was there was no help
 
00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
in this regard as we're looking at now
 
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
i've seen this developed i've helped it
 
00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:30.959 align:start position:0%
peripherally through being a delegate to
 
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
the ama
 
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
american medical association and through
 
00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:35.350 align:start position:0%
american medical association and through
the

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire medical society uh this
 
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
has been
 
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
um a very very concerted effort um
 
00:09:46.389 --> 00:09:46.399 align:start position:0%
um and it's it's not perfect
 
00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
um and uh for that reason there's always
 
00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
going to be some changes as use
 
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
comes along the way um we'll find ways
 
00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.990 align:start position:0%
comes along the way um we'll find ways
that

00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
will need to be changed at this juncture
 
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
i would have absolutely no problem uh
 
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
with retaining it
 
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh if i could find if there are some uh
 
00:10:11.829 --> 00:10:11.839 align:start position:0%
very concrete
 
00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
areas uh that can be specifically
 
00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
uh uh examined and i would i would be
 
00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
very happy to be part of that group to
 
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
work on it uh in that guys um
 
00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
but has been alluded to already
 
00:10:31.829 --> 00:10:31.839 align:start position:0%
uh the myriad of people who have
 
00:10:34.389 --> 00:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
addressed us have been in very vague
 
00:10:34.399 --> 00:10:35.430 align:start position:0%
addressed us have been in very vague
terms

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
terms
 
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
uh and when they have addressed uh
 
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
supposedly specific items uh they
 
00:10:42.949 --> 00:10:42.959 align:start position:0%
clearly have not read uh
 
00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
the bill um so i'm i'm i'm
 
00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
i would like to retain it and work on it
 
00:10:51.269 --> 00:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
if there are specific
 
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
things to work on uh and if it were
 
00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.190 align:start position:0%
things to work on uh and if it were
retained

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
retained
 
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh then i would uh put my shoulder to
 
00:10:58.949 --> 00:10:58.959 align:start position:0%
the task
 
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
and i would only retain it if we had
 
00:11:04.949 --> 00:11:04.959 align:start position:0%
an honest commitment to do that with
 
00:11:04.959 --> 00:11:06.310 align:start position:0%
an honest commitment to do that with
specific

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
entities in mind again i have not seen
 
00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
that yet
 
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
but i would like to hear some even at
 
00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
this moment
 
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
if we could but this has been a good
 
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.269 align:start position:0%
if we could but this has been a good
bill

00:11:19.269 --> 00:11:19.279 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
it's come a long way i look at it from
 
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
two perspectives
 
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
that if we um
 
00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh when we pass a piece of legislation
 
00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:31.279 align:start position:0%
uh any piece of legislation for that
 
00:11:31.279 --> 00:11:32.150 align:start position:0%
uh any piece of legislation for that
matter

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
matter
 
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh are we doing harm in any way by
 
00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences
 
00:11:40.069 --> 00:11:40.079 align:start position:0%
uh or are we doing harm by not passing
 
00:11:40.079 --> 00:11:42.310 align:start position:0%
uh or are we doing harm by not passing
it

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:44.720 align:start position:0%
would we be helping more by passing it
 
00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
at this juncture
 
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
at this juncture i can see that passing
 
00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
it would be of more benefit
 
00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:53.519 align:start position:0%
but if it were retained i could be
 
00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
happy with that if if if
 
00:11:59.190 --> 00:11:59.200 align:start position:0%
we have some very specific items that
 
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
need to be addressed
 
00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
representative representative soloway
 
00:12:10.949 --> 00:12:10.959 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um like to speak
 
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
against the motion to retain
 
00:12:17.829 --> 00:12:17.839 align:start position:0%
i've put deep deep thought into this
 
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
and i've conferenced with members of
 
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
on both sides and have dare i say
 
00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
agonized over it
 
00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:28.240 align:start position:0%
i do not wish to contest the quality of
 
00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
the bill i think that the senate
 
00:12:33.509 --> 00:12:33.519 align:start position:0%
and this committee have done yeoman work
 
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
in crafting the best possible bill
 
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
for the moment what i would like to
 
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
speak to is the political process
 
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
and the political process is uh that
 
00:12:44.629 --> 00:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
many of us
 
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
who are committed to the content of the
 
00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:48.069 align:start position:0%
who are committed to the content of the
bill

00:12:48.069 --> 00:12:48.079 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
um do not wish to risk the bill
 
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
being rejected by the full house however
 
00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
the fact of the matter is
 
00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
that the full house does represent the
 
00:13:00.069 --> 00:13:00.079 align:start position:0%
will of the people
 
00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
and it's time to let the full house make
 
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
its own decision
 
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
about otp or itl or tabling
 
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
this motion and i would like to see an
 
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
otp motion
 
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
come out of this committee thank you mr
 
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative
 
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else i see your hand but
 
00:13:19.269 --> 00:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
i don't see your face
 
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh clerk representative canark who has
 
00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
apologies there we are yep i would like
 
00:13:35.829 --> 00:13:35.839 align:start position:0%
to echo what has previously been said
 
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
um i have received also a number of
 
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
emails all of which represented that uh
 
00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
demonstrated that apparently the
 
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
offender had not looked at the bill
 
00:13:46.629 --> 00:13:46.639 align:start position:0%
and um you know again the whole issue
 
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
that it allows
 
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
assisted suicide if we look on page 24

euthanasia

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
euthanasia
 
00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
i don't know how much more clearly that
 
00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519 align:start position:0%
can be stated
 
00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
that isn't even confusing legalese
 
00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
that's plain english
 
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
so i would echo what representative
 
00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
woods said i've also heard that people
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
have concerns about it well then
 
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
right now in this committee please give
 
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
some examples of where it is confusing
 
00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
wordy because some of the examples
 
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
were brought up during the hearing and
 
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
those were explained
 
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
and they were quite clear and there was
 
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
not a confusion
 
00:14:30.949 --> 00:14:30.959 align:start position:0%
i think that anybody who wants to vote
 
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
for retaining this
 
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
should uh be able to see that as
 
00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:36.959 align:start position:0%
representative woods just said
 
00:14:39.269 --> 00:14:39.279 align:start position:0%
that there are some clear flaws and so i
 
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
would invite
 
00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:42.959 align:start position:0%
those who favor retaining to demonstrate
 
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:44.720 align:start position:0%
those at this point in time
 
00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
to convince those of us who want to
 
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
actually have an ought to pass
 
00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
motion to think about retention
 
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
if we can see clear flaws that can be
 
00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.590 align:start position:0%
if we can see clear flaws that can be
addressed

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
in absence of that i think also yes we
 
00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:58.629 align:start position:0%
in absence of that i think also yes we
should

00:14:58.629 --> 00:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
should
 
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
pass to get this bill out of this
 
00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
committee as an ought to pass
 
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
and as representative salloway said let
 
00:15:05.189 --> 00:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
the full house
 
00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:08.240 align:start position:0%
vote on it thank you thank you by the
 
00:15:08.949 --> 00:15:08.959 align:start position:0%
way i should
 
00:15:10.629 --> 00:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
i should also add the fact that the
 
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
catholic diocese is on board with this
 
00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
and they are pretty smart and they think
 
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:16.550 align:start position:0%
and they are pretty smart and they think
well

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:15:18.389 --> 00:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
and we're quite convinced that they do
 
00:15:20.389 --> 00:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
not support
 
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
assisted suicide and the fact that they
 
00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
are on board with this means
 
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
that it has i think a good stamp of
 
00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:28.959 align:start position:0%
approval that it is a good
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
well thought out bill thank you thank
 
00:15:33.749 --> 00:15:33.759 align:start position:0%
you representative do we have anyone
 
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
else who's
 
00:15:37.189 --> 00:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
uh in the meeting via zoom who wishes to
 
00:15:37.199 --> 00:15:37.749 align:start position:0%
uh in the meeting via zoom who wishes to
speak

00:15:37.749 --> 00:15:37.759 align:start position:0%
speak
 
00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
no i don't see any humans
 
00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
okay i don't see anybody anybody in the
 
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
committee room who will switch to speak
 
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um so
 
00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
my my concern is not that this bill is a
 
00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
euthanasia bill
 
00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
um but that its intention was to clarify
 
00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:01.749 align:start position:0%
um but that its intention was to clarify
language

00:16:01.749 --> 00:16:01.759 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
and make some other provisions but um
 
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
clearly from all these emails
 
00:16:10.069 --> 00:16:10.079 align:start position:0%
it's it's not clear to other you know to
 
00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
some of our stakeholders you know that
 
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
this bill would affect
 
00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:17.519 align:start position:0%
um specifically bobby schindler
 
00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
terry schago's brother if you remember
 
00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
the case of terry scheibel she was a
 
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
woman with a traumatic brain injury
 
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
and her nutrition and hydration was
 
00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
stopped by a court order
 
00:16:29.189 --> 00:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
against the family's wishes he sent us
 
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
an email
 
00:16:34.389 --> 00:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
asking us to icl the bill and
 
00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
i think his testimony if you guys uh
 
00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
take a look at it is pretty
 
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
um you know profound but my reasons
 
00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
um striking the language on page six
 
00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
lines 36 and 37
 
00:16:51.189 --> 00:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
um and page seven lines one through
 
00:16:53.749 --> 00:16:53.759 align:start position:0%
three making it so that
 
00:16:57.269 --> 00:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
the um choosing to have one's wishes
 
00:16:57.279 --> 00:16:58.790 align:start position:0%
the um choosing to have one's wishes
overwritten

00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
overwritten
 
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
should you no longer have the capacity
 
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
for decision making
 
00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:11.669 --> 00:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
instead of needing an explicit statement
 
00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:14.079 align:start position:0%
in the advanced directive i think this
 
00:17:14.949 --> 00:17:14.959 align:start position:0%
means deeper
 
00:17:17.029 --> 00:17:17.039 align:start position:0%
consideration and tightening of the
 
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
proposed language
 
00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:20.079 align:start position:0%
and while i can see some situations
 
00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
where that could be necessary
 
00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
um such as in a person who has dementia
 
00:17:27.669 --> 00:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
who's refusing showers
 
00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
um there are other situations where you
 
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
know this would be
 
00:17:32.789 --> 00:17:32.799 align:start position:0%
problematic such as someone who has a
 
00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
traumatic brain injury or
 
00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:36.559 align:start position:0%
another acute injury or illness that can
 
00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
cause a transient state of incapacity
 
00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
for medical decision making
 
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
it would be difficult for them to
 
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
resume um the capability to
 
00:17:49.909 --> 00:17:49.919 align:start position:0%
to decide for themselves in that
 
00:17:49.919 --> 00:17:51.270 align:start position:0%
to decide for themselves in that
scenario

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
scenario
 
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
section five there's a measure to allow
 
00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
surrogates or agents consent to
 
00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
clinical trials for experimental
 
00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.630 align:start position:0%
clinical trials for experimental
treatments

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
treatments
 
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
not only just intended to save their
 
00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
life but to quote reduce
 
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
pain distress or discomfort i think this
 
00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
language is very broad
 
00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
and opens the door to virtually any
 
00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
medication trial for any diagnosis a
 
00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
patient has which many patients have
 
00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
many diagnoses um so you know that could
 
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
include a clinical trial for any
 
00:18:23.909 --> 00:18:23.919 align:start position:0%
simple things such as hyperlipidemia or
 
00:18:23.919 --> 00:18:24.710 align:start position:0%
simple things such as hyperlipidemia or
heartburn

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
heartburn
 
00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
to you know a vaccination for a disease
 
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
likely to cause discomfort any disease
 
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
maybe one that's not even deadly so we
 
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
need to be very careful here
 
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
um the form for advanced directives and
 
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
disclosure statement has some issues
 
00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
the disclosure statement claims that the
 
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
default position
 
00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
is your agent can consent to enroll you
 
00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
in clinical trials but
 
00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:53.039 align:start position:0%
you may write otherwise and the advanced
 
00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
directive form which is signed
 
00:18:57.029 --> 00:18:57.039 align:start position:0%
leaves out language on the current form
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
that says
 
00:18:59.510 --> 00:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
i hereby acknowledge that i've been
 
00:19:01.669 --> 00:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
provided with the disclosure statement
 
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
explaining the effects of this directive
 
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
i have read and understand the
 
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
information contained in the disclosure
 
00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.590 align:start position:0%
information contained in the disclosure
statement

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
statement
 
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
um as written in sb 74 it just says i
 
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
have received the disclosure statement
 
00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
so not necessarily that you read and
 
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
on page 18 line six
 
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
the advanced directives are clarified by
 
00:19:27.909 --> 00:19:27.919 align:start position:0%
crossing out and initially any
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
statements one disagrees with
 
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
i think this is confusing and it doesn't
 
00:19:33.909 --> 00:19:33.919 align:start position:0%
lend to clarity at all
 
00:19:35.669 --> 00:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
the section should have a box of the yes
 
00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
or no or some other clear language
 
00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:40.160 align:start position:0%
i do wish i do not wish with the option
 
00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
to choose one or the other like the
 
00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:44.630 align:start position:0%
to choose one or the other like the
present

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of others and i i
 
00:19:47.909 --> 00:19:47.919 align:start position:0%
don't mind going through but
 
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
um just as a start you know that's
 
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
that's where some of the problematic
 
00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:54.070 align:start position:0%
that's where some of the problematic
languages

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
languages
 
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative anyone else in
 
00:20:04.549 --> 00:20:04.559 align:start position:0%

wish to yes representative king
 
00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:07.909 align:start position:0%
wish to yes representative king

00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
the um i just wanted to
 
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
make a point of clarification that uh
 
00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
representative weber made reference to
 
00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:20.789 align:start position:0%
representative weber made reference to
is

00:20:20.789 --> 00:20:20.799 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:20:22.549 --> 00:20:22.559 align:start position:0%
uh this wasn't something that just came
 
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
together over the weekend
 
00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
it was actually first presented to us at
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
the last committee meeting
 
00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:31.919 align:start position:0%
by representative leahan and
 
00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
um in her in her testimony
 
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
she lists uh several i think there's
 
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
like nine or ten things that uh she saw
 
00:20:46.549 --> 00:20:46.559 align:start position:0%
wrong with the uh bill as as it
 
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
currently reads and
 
00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
then uh at the end when we made a
 
00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
a request on whether we wanted to
 
00:20:56.789 --> 00:20:56.799 align:start position:0%
actually look into this
 
00:20:59.750 --> 00:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
um representative gay had brought up
 
00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:00.230 align:start position:0%
um representative gay had brought up
that

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
she wanted to put some language together
 
00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:03.510 align:start position:0%
she wanted to put some language together
um

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:07.029 --> 00:21:07.039 align:start position:0%
and then over the last two weeks um
 
00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:10.559 align:start position:0%
there's been um you know
 
00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
some research and further looking into
 
00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
this bill so
 
00:21:16.549 --> 00:21:16.559 align:start position:0%
it's hard to actually say that nobody's
 
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
actually read through this
 
00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
i think um i think there's been a lot of
 
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
work put into
 
00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
uh some of this and also some of their
 
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
discussions with
 
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh representative leon in her testimony
 
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
she says that she
 
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to kill this bill and um
 
00:21:35.029 --> 00:21:35.039 align:start position:0%
you have actually gotten her to a point
 
00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
where she would support a retaining
 
00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
if that's what the committee feels so i
 
00:21:44.549 --> 00:21:44.559 align:start position:0%
believe that um
 
00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
i think retaining is definitely a good
 
00:21:48.789 --> 00:21:48.799 align:start position:0%
option at this point that
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
i think all of us feel that this is a
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
good bill and that
 
00:21:53.909 --> 00:21:53.919 align:start position:0%
we just need to look at some of the
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
further language and i do appreciate all
 
00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
the work that's been put into it up to
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
this point it's just i think
 
00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
that a little bit more needs to be put
 
00:22:02.789 --> 00:22:02.799 align:start position:0%
into it thank you
 
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative anyone else
 
00:22:10.149 --> 00:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
then a few things from me um
 
00:22:15.669 --> 00:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
as the chairman three reasons i would
 
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
support retention
 
00:22:21.029 --> 00:22:21.039 align:start position:0%
i still do see confusion in this
 
00:22:21.039 --> 00:22:22.630 align:start position:0%
i still do see confusion in this
language

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
and i have given copies of this world to
 
00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:28.559 align:start position:0%
numbers of
 
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
friends who are quite intelligent and
 
00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
about half of them have said
 
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
i don't see any confusion and the other
 
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
half of them say
 
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
i see numbers of places with confusion
 
00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
secondly page
 
00:22:49.029 --> 00:22:49.039 align:start position:0%
23 lines 30 and following
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
an agent or surrogate may revoke
 
00:22:55.029 --> 00:22:55.039 align:start position:0%
a do not resuscitate or pulsed order for
 
00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919 align:start position:0%
a principal
 
00:22:58.789 --> 00:22:58.799 align:start position:0%
who lacks capacity to make health care
 
00:22:58.799 --> 00:23:00.870 align:start position:0%
who lacks capacity to make health care
decisions

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
there are numbers of people who wish to
 
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
deny that
 
00:23:09.669 --> 00:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
that maybe the person was of clear mind
 
00:23:12.789 --> 00:23:12.799 align:start position:0%
when he or she wrote that but is not
 
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
that now
 
00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:16.799 align:start position:0%
but the orders were written or the
 
00:23:18.549 --> 00:23:18.559 align:start position:0%
desire was made known
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
when the person was of capacity to make
 
00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
a healthcare decision
 
00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
and therefore numbers of us
 
00:23:29.909 --> 00:23:29.919 align:start position:0%
believe that the surrogate does not have
 
00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
should not have the right
 
00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
to overrule that and then thirdly
 
00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
i've come to these conclusions before
 
00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
the barrage of
 
00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
weekend emails i've read some of them
 
00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
and um i don't agree with a number i
 
00:23:47.669 --> 00:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
agree with their conclusions
 
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
but i do not agree with the
 
00:23:53.669 --> 00:23:53.679 align:start position:0%
reasoning that got some of them there i
 
00:23:53.679 --> 00:23:54.390 align:start position:0%
reasoning that got some of them there i
see

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
the statement about euthanasia as clear
 
00:23:59.190 --> 00:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
as it possibly can be
 
00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
so people who say that it is the
 
00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
slippery slope to euthanasia
 
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
i don't see that at all the final reason
 
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
is i've been talking with numbers of
 
00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
people in my party
 
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
recently i learned
 
00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
not surprisingly that the freedom
 
00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.750 align:start position:0%
not surprisingly that the freedom
republicans

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
republicans
 
00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
want to stress the rights of the
 
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
individual for self-determination
 
00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
and for reasons i just gave do not see
 
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
that self-determination as clear as it
 
00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:28.950 align:start position:0%
that self-determination as clear as it
is

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
in the laws of some states but if it
 
00:24:33.269 --> 00:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
were just the freedom republicans
 
00:24:36.549 --> 00:24:36.559 align:start position:0%
um i can do a nice count in voting
 
00:24:38.789 --> 00:24:38.799 align:start position:0%
um the bill would probably pass but what
 
00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
i have seen
 
00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
is numbers of others who would not
 
00:24:44.789 --> 00:24:44.799 align:start position:0%
really wish to identify
 
00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
with the freedom caucus at all on most
 
00:24:48.789 --> 00:24:48.799 align:start position:0%
things or many things
 
00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
also have come to the same conclusion
 
00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
and if the bill goes to the house floor
 
00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
and is defeated it will come back next
 
00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.350 align:start position:0%
and is defeated it will come back next
year

00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
and there's a number of things in this
 
00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:00.950 align:start position:0%
and there's a number of things in this
bill

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
that are good and an improvement and i
 
00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to see that
 
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
and so rather than just passing it as is
 
00:25:11.669 --> 00:25:11.679 align:start position:0%
with the problems i see or defeating it
 
00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:13.919 align:start position:0%
which i would not wish i think the
 
00:25:15.909 --> 00:25:15.919 align:start position:0%
motion to retain
 
00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
is the one that i'm supporting
 
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
for me retaining a bill and there's
 
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
really no pun intended on this
 
00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
is not death with dignity um motion to
 
00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:28.230 align:start position:0%
is not death with dignity um motion to
retain

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:28.240 align:start position:0%
retain
 
00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
for me and knowing this committee is
 
00:25:32.789 --> 00:25:32.799 align:start position:0%
let's really work on it let's polish it
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
until it shines
 
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
which is kind of like what we've been
 
00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
doing all year so far
 
00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:41.039 align:start position:0%
and i would very much want to put on uh
 
00:25:41.039 --> 00:25:41.510 align:start position:0%
and i would very much want to put on uh
such

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
such
 
00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:45.200 align:start position:0%
a um retained committee
 
00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh people who generally favor the bill
 
00:25:50.149 --> 00:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
but want to remove the roadblocks that
 
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
some of us face
 
00:25:53.909 --> 00:25:53.919 align:start position:0%
so for that reason i would move to
 
00:25:53.919 --> 00:25:55.190 align:start position:0%
so for that reason i would move to
routine

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
routine
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:19.430 align:start position:0%

decisions of transitioning from uh

from fighting a terrible disease to
 
00:26:45.669 --> 00:26:45.679 align:start position:0%
hospice and she sees these problems

daily and it rips families apart and

act and the people in the room really
 
00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:53.029 align:start position:0%
act and the people in the room really

00:26:53.029 --> 00:26:53.039 align:start position:0%
can't
 
00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:56.159 --> 00:26:59.590 align:start position:0%

bit louder here is that is that better
 
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
that's better thank you okay sorry about
 
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
that i i just i have a different
 
00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:16.549 align:start position:0%
that i i just i have a different
microphone

00:27:16.549 --> 00:27:16.559 align:start position:0%
microphone
 
00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
um just to recap my my wife as you all
 
00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
know is my eyes and ears
 
00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
as a home care physical therapist she
 
00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
deals with the problems that we're
 
00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
00:27:28.789 --> 00:27:28.799 align:start position:0%
address here every single day and it's
 
00:27:28.799 --> 00:27:29.350 align:start position:0%
address here every single day and it's
it's

00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:32.480 align:start position:0%
the time has come to to address these
 
00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
problems we have to fix it now the
 
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
the amount of people that have gone in
 
00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:38.720 align:start position:0%
in organizations and so forth
 
00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
that have had input into this is
 
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
impressive um
 
00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
and we've gotten to this point where we
 
00:27:45.269 --> 00:27:45.279 align:start position:0%
have a
 
00:27:46.789 --> 00:27:46.799 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation yes it's not
 
00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
perfect like very few
 
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
pieces of legislation we ever deal with
 
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
this complex are going to be perfect
 
00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
but what i see now is
 
00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
and and certainly mr chairman i i
 
00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:02.549 align:start position:0%
and and certainly mr chairman i i
understand

00:28:02.549 --> 00:28:02.559 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
your your um pledge of of doing
 
00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
a real study on this if the time comes
 
00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
but i just i just believe i resent that
 
00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
this was turned into a
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
ideological choice
 
00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
of of euthanasia when and
 
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
it's just it seems as though this is
 
00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
just being killed it
 
00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
an attempt is being made to kill this
 
00:28:30.149 --> 00:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
an ideological bounds when this is a
 
00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
problem that needs to be solved we need
 
00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
to get on with it
 
00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
retaining is just going to put it off
 
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
for another
 
00:28:40.149 --> 00:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
another uh until next year and i just
 
00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
don't see that that
 
00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
that's the smart move i think we should
 
00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
move to the
 
00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
move to the floor and if if there needs
 
00:28:48.789 --> 00:28:48.799 align:start position:0%
to be amendments
 
00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
on the floor to address these these
 
00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
individual issues which wouldn't
 
00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
um be unprecedented then let's do it but
 
00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:56.870 align:start position:0%
um be unprecedented then let's do it but
let's

00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
let's
 
00:28:59.029 --> 00:28:59.039 align:start position:0%
let's make the move let's let's take the
 
00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:00.640 align:start position:0%
immense amount of work being done
 
00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
from across the entire industry really
 
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
of of medical care
 
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
and and let's let's make this happen and
 
00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
if there's issues that pop up that we
 
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
can fix it next year with legislation
 
00:29:13.029 --> 00:29:13.039 align:start position:0%
but i i'm just i've had it with
 
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
retaining things
 
00:29:17.909 --> 00:29:17.919 align:start position:0%
with let's get proactive here let's move
 
00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
this to the house
 
00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
we can fight it out there no matter what
 
00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
happens and take it from there
 
00:29:25.269 --> 00:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
that's that's my belief thank you thank
 
00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
you representative my response to
 
00:29:31.029 --> 00:29:31.039 align:start position:0%
uh one of your comments is i certainly
 
00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
do not see this as ideological i see
 
00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
this as a matter of clarity
 
00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
nor did i hear any of the uh my
 
00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:39.350 align:start position:0%
nor did i hear any of the uh my
colleagues

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
colleagues
 
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
in the room speak that this is
 
00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
a slippery slope i think we all agree
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
that euthanasia terms
 
00:29:48.549 --> 00:29:48.559 align:start position:0%
irrespective of what emails came in over
 
00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
the weekend the
 
00:29:55.269 --> 00:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
euthanasia issue is very clear and um uh
 
00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
again it's a matter of clarity but thank
 
00:29:58.470 --> 00:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
you uh
 
00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
for your testimony anyone else
 
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
a representative um nikki
 
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
if you look at the current advanced
 
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
directive form there is a section for
 
00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
additional instructions which is large
 
00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
and mentions instructions about refusing
 
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
any specific types
 
00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
of treatment that are inconsistent with
 
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
your religious beliefs or are
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
unacceptable to you for any other reason
 
00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
this section however does not exist on
 
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
the forum if
 
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
sb 74 passes as currently written
 
00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
and then on page 25 line 6 it strikes
 
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
the ability for a patient's common-law
 
00:30:51.149 --> 00:30:51.159 align:start position:0%
spouse as defined by rsa
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
457-39 to be deemed the patient
 
00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
surrogate i don't have um all the
 
00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
answers to these issues but despite the
 
00:31:00.789 --> 00:31:00.799 align:start position:0%
staple they're spending so much time on
 
00:31:00.799 --> 00:31:01.190 align:start position:0%
staple they're spending so much time on
this

00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
and then they are meaning well there are
 
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
some problems with this bill
 
00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:08.559 align:start position:0%
i feel like truly i i like this bill but
 
00:31:10.389 --> 00:31:10.399 align:start position:0%
i feel like that we need to fix the
 
00:31:11.269 --> 00:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
issues now
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
so and not pass something that that can
 
00:31:15.909 --> 00:31:15.919 align:start position:0%
die on the floor because then it can't
 
00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
come back so i
 
00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
this is why i would be in favor of
 
00:31:21.909 --> 00:31:21.919 align:start position:0%
retaining this
 
00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:25.350 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
gay

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
gay
 
00:31:27.029 --> 00:31:27.039 align:start position:0%
yes i didn't want to speak at length
 
00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:30.799 align:start position:0%
when i first spoke so i wanted to add
 
00:31:33.509 --> 00:31:33.519 align:start position:0%
there are several specific things that
 
00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
need to be fixed
 
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
and i don't think waiting until we can
 
00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:38.310 align:start position:0%
and i don't think waiting until we can
vote

00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
again not in june the next time i don't
 
00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
think for something that's been
 
00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
decades in the making is a bad
 
00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
investment of time
 
00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
we want this bill to pass as soon as
 
00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:50.870 align:start position:0%
we want this bill to pass as soon as
possible

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
gets killed on the floor we lose it for
 
00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
two years
 
00:31:57.269 --> 00:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
and start over so i will say some more
 
00:31:57.279 --> 00:31:58.870 align:start position:0%
and start over so i will say some more
specifics

00:31:58.870 --> 00:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
specifics
 
00:32:01.029 --> 00:32:01.039 align:start position:0%
it's not all of them but it's a couple
 
00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
of specifics
 
00:32:06.149 --> 00:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
and one is removing in several places
 
00:32:09.269 --> 00:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
the role of the family has been put
 
00:32:12.549 --> 00:32:12.559 align:start position:0%
lower than the role of the doctors
 
00:32:16.549 --> 00:32:16.559 align:start position:0%
or pa's or um
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioners the family has been
 
00:32:23.909 --> 00:32:23.919 align:start position:0%
left much lower in having authority to
 
00:32:23.919 --> 00:32:25.190 align:start position:0%
left much lower in having authority to
determine

00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
determine
 
00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:29.890 align:start position:0%
uh what the patient wants and also
 
00:32:29.890 --> 00:32:32.950 align:start position:0%
uh what the patient wants and also
[Music]

00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
well i forgot the other thing but i mean
 
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
that's pretty critical
 
00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
that the family is less important
 
00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:54.950 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
or that if you do sundowning where
 
00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
they're clear in the morning
 
00:33:01.269 --> 00:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
as the day gets in the evening that's
 
00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
not the time to ask for something
 
00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:04.149 align:start position:0%
not the time to ask for something
important

00:33:04.149 --> 00:33:04.159 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
um i've buried both of my patients and
 
00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:07.269 align:start position:0%
um i've buried both of my patients and
both

00:33:07.269 --> 00:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
both
 
00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
my parents my husband's parents so
 
00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
uh and as i get older i'm very concerned
 
00:33:18.389 --> 00:33:18.399 align:start position:0%
about these patient rights i think we
 
00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
have to go over it
 
00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
find some phone and correct some wording
 
00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
that's not badly intentioned except i do
 
00:33:27.269 --> 00:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
think when you
 
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
say family is not near as important as a
 
00:33:33.509 --> 00:33:33.519 align:start position:0%
as a surrogate i do think that
 
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
needs to change but i really think the
 
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.110 align:start position:0%
needs to change but i really think the
changes

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
are not really policy
 
00:33:43.509 --> 00:33:43.519 align:start position:0%
i think they are inadvertent
 
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
to remove authority from the patient
 
00:33:50.789 --> 00:33:50.799 align:start position:0%
the principal and their families
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
so it's you know i don't think it's fair
 
00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
to say
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
this is prejudice i think we are all
 
00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:59.430 align:start position:0%
this is prejudice i think we are all
concerned

00:33:59.430 --> 00:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
about specifics that need to be
 
00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
addressed and clarified and that is done
 
00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
much better in work
 
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
sessions rather than an amendment here
 
00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
and there
 
00:34:13.669 --> 00:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
a lot of people in this committee were
 
00:34:14.869 --> 00:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
on the committee that
 
00:34:18.069 --> 00:34:18.079 align:start position:0%
came up with this bill most of us were
 
00:34:18.079 --> 00:34:18.950 align:start position:0%
came up with this bill most of us were
not

00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
or we could have said this you know
 
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
months ago so we wouldn't be coming
 
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
after the fact and saying but wait a
 
00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
minute we need to fix this
 
00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
so i beg you let's fix it it needs to
 
00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:32.389 align:start position:0%
so i beg you let's fix it it needs to
pass

00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
pass
 
00:34:34.869 --> 00:34:34.879 align:start position:0%
we need to make it clear if very
 
00:34:36.629 --> 00:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
intelligent people can read this
 
00:34:38.629 --> 00:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
and say this doesn't i don't know what
 
00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:39.919 align:start position:0%
they're saying here
 
00:34:42.869 --> 00:34:42.879 align:start position:0%
i have a real problem with the form i
 
00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
think whenever you sign something you
 
00:34:46.149 --> 00:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
want to be signing what you're
 
00:34:48.869 --> 00:34:48.879 align:start position:0%
intending and if somebody says oh it
 
00:34:52.149 --> 00:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
can't be more than a page or two
 
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
that's a bunch of baloney buy a house
 
00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
you don't sign one or two pages
 
00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
everything all the policy needs to be
 
00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
in the document that you sign and maybe
 
00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
that'll mean some of the
 
00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
legalese that repeats and repeats and
 
00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
repeats maybe that can be clarified
 
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
but when you sign something you should
 
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
not have to be referring
 
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
to another page another paragraph to see
 
00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
what you're signing
 
00:35:21.829 --> 00:35:21.839 align:start position:0%
so i want this bill to pass i just want
 
00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
it to be
 
00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
in good usable understandable form
 
00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
i am not slamming anybody who worked on
 
00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:30.710 align:start position:0%
i am not slamming anybody who worked on
building

00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
building
 
00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
on building this i know you put blood
 
00:35:35.349 --> 00:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
sweat and tears and many hours
 
00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:37.300 align:start position:0%
into it
 
00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:38.630 align:start position:0%
into it
[Music]

00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative is there anyone
 
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
else who wishes to speak do you see any
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
hands madam clerk
 
00:35:47.829 --> 00:35:47.839 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative
 
00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
thank you a couple of things to keep in
 
00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:50.870 align:start position:0%
thank you a couple of things to keep in
mind

00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
mind
 
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
one is that when you talk about the
 
00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:54.150 align:start position:0%
one is that when you talk about the
forms

00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
forms
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
the language that is in this statute
 
00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:57.190 align:start position:0%
the language that is in this statute
says

00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
says
 
00:35:59.829 --> 00:35:59.839 align:start position:0%
uh components shall be substantially in
 
00:35:59.839 --> 00:36:00.390 align:start position:0%
uh components shall be substantially in
the

00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
substantially the following form that
 
00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:04.720 align:start position:0%
means that it is not going to have to be
 
00:36:07.349 --> 00:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
absolutely verbatim what is in the bill
 
00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
issues if it's clearer with a check box
 
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
rather than a cross out an initial
 
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
that can be done these this is not
 
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
something where it has to be precisely
 
00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:17.109 align:start position:0%
something where it has to be precisely
this

00:36:17.109 --> 00:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
so those concerns can be addressed after
 
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
this bill is passed
 
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
but nothing can be done if the bill
 
00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
isn't passed
 
00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
uh likewise i the comments
 
00:36:30.069 --> 00:36:30.079 align:start position:0%
um they were i was going to respond but
 
00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
i couldn't keep track of everything
 
00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:33.599 align:start position:0%
some of the issues that i think are
 
00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
confusing to people the
 
00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh i would like representative clarify
 
00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:38.720 align:start position:0%
where the
 
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
family is placed below the practitioner
 
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
the practitioner i think that may be in
 
00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
these places where he refers to who
 
00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
writes the orders
 
00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
and that's because a family can't go in
 
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
and write an order only the practitioner
 
00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:51.430 align:start position:0%
and write an order only the practitioner
can

00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
but the family or whoever is the
 
00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
designated sur
 
00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
surrogate is the one who tells the
 
00:36:58.870 --> 00:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
physician or the
 
00:37:02.069 --> 00:37:02.079 align:start position:0%
sorry the practitioner what to write
 
00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
only the practitioner right and that was
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
came up in the hearing it came up in the
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
hearing about why was that language
 
00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:07.349 align:start position:0%
hearing about why was that language
there

00:37:07.349 --> 00:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
it has to do with who can actually write
 
00:37:11.109 --> 00:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
an order in a chart
 
00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
so that's important likewise the issue
 
00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
about incompetence
 
00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
we're you know we we frequently are
 
00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
dealing with people
 
00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
just think about your standard person
 
00:37:23.349 --> 00:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
intubated in icu after a few days
 
00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
most of them are not particularly able
 
00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
to make good decisions at that point
 
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
they often become psychotic
 
00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
and we they may want to try to pull
 
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
their tube out should we just let them
 
00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
pull their tube out when they're
 
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:36.640 align:start position:0%
from have a perfectly reversible disease
 
00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
that's what they want to do right then
 
00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
but no we sedate them to keep them safe
 
00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
so they don't pull their tube out so
 
00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
they can recover
 
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
and then eventually turn back into the
 
00:37:49.349 --> 00:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
same viable person they were
 
00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
before they got that transient illness
 
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
so we're not talking about
 
00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
when we say we not respect their wish at
 
00:37:58.069 --> 00:37:58.079 align:start position:0%
that point they yank their tube out
 
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
it's because it's for their safety
 
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
obviously this goes into much more the
 
00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
longer term issues
 
00:38:05.109 --> 00:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
the issue too about terry schiavo's
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
brother i wonder whether he read this
 
00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
bill indeed
 
00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
there would not have been a court order
 
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
if they had an advance directive
 
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
i think it went to the court because
 
00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
there was not an advance directive to
 
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
clarify what the
 
00:38:20.069 --> 00:38:20.079 align:start position:0%
what the treatment should be to prevent
 
00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
the problem with terri schiavo is
 
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
exactly why we have this and this bill
 
00:38:26.069 --> 00:38:26.079 align:start position:0%
would have clarified with
 
00:38:28.069 --> 00:38:28.079 align:start position:0%
certainty that if there were not an
 
00:38:29.349 --> 00:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
advance directive
 
00:38:31.829 --> 00:38:31.839 align:start position:0%
who the surrogate would be and that
 
00:38:31.839 --> 00:38:32.950 align:start position:0%
who the surrogate would be and that
surrogate

00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
surrogate
 
00:38:35.829 --> 00:38:35.839 align:start position:0%
would have been the family it gives that
 
00:38:35.839 --> 00:38:36.550 align:start position:0%
would have been the family it gives that
order

00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
order
 
00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
that sequence in the bill here about who
 
00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:39.829 align:start position:0%
that sequence in the bill here about who
takes

00:38:39.829 --> 00:38:39.839 align:start position:0%
takes
 
00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
first first second third and if they are
 
00:38:43.589 --> 00:38:43.599 align:start position:0%
capable if they're not capable or
 
00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
they're deceased or whatever
 
00:38:47.109 --> 00:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
you go to the next one the family would
 
00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
have been in charge
 
00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
their problem would not have occurred
 
00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
had this bill
 
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
for example been in effect when she had
 
00:38:56.069 --> 00:38:56.079 align:start position:0%
her problem
 
00:38:59.190 --> 00:38:59.200 align:start position:0%
so i still do not think i i'm still i i
 
00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
guess i would go back and ask
 
00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
could representative gay please identify
 
00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
where it is that the family is placed
 
00:39:07.829 --> 00:39:07.839 align:start position:0%
below the practitioner by page and line
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
so we can actually look at it rather
 
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
than just making the statement
 
00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
without the backup thank you
 
00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
gay yes
 
00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
i will attempt to do that i have a few
 
00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
places marked
 
00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
and i don't know how great a job i'm
 
00:39:26.829 --> 00:39:26.839 align:start position:0%
going to do explaining them
 
00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
um let's see
 
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
page 23 line 16 and 17
 
00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
about the flow of the family uh
 
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:38.870 align:start position:0%
about the flow of the family uh
requesting

00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
requesting
 
00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
transfer care if a provider has a moral
 
00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
objection to a dnr
 
00:39:49.109 --> 00:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
or we should be talking to a post um
 
00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
i won't issue a post um
 
00:40:08.829 --> 00:40:08.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:08.839 --> 00:40:12.950 align:start position:0%
 
30.

00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
um could i request the chapter number
 
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
because i'm reading it online
 
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't give the page numbers it
 
00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
just gives the roman numerals
 
00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:25.599 align:start position:0%
okay this is i'm not quite sure where
 
00:40:25.599 --> 00:40:26.710 align:start position:0%
okay this is i'm not quite sure where
the

00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:40:30.069 --> 00:40:30.079 align:start position:0%
two roman numeral two is late and it's
 
00:40:31.109 --> 00:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
on page 25
 
00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
of 26 so i'm not quite sure what almost
 
00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
at the very end yeah it's under 137 j35
 
00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:49.349 --> 00:40:49.359 align:start position:0%
welcome well it says roman numeral 2
 
00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:59.190 --> 00:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't see 12 but anyway
 
00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that decision maker is
 
00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
identified by the attending
 
00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
practitioners may make health care
 
00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
decisions for the patients
 
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
in accordance with rsa 137 j6
 
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
the surrogacy provisions of this chapter
 
00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
shall take effect in the decision maker
 
00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
names are reported in the medical record
 
00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
so you
 
00:41:19.109 --> 00:41:19.119 align:start position:0%
always have to get this put in the
 
00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
medical record
 
00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
the attendant practitioner
 
00:41:29.589 --> 00:41:29.599 align:start position:0%
believes after reasonable inquiry that
 
00:41:31.349 --> 00:41:31.359 align:start position:0%
neither a health care agent
 
00:41:33.349 --> 00:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
under a durable power attorney for
 
00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
health care or a surrogate
 
00:41:37.589 --> 00:41:37.599 align:start position:0%
fire priority is available or able and
 
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
willing to act
 
00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
so i left out a line they they can
 
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
change that person's uh the surrogate or
 
00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:46.309 align:start position:0%
change that person's uh the surrogate or
the

00:41:46.309 --> 00:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
durable power of attorney if they think
 
00:41:49.349 --> 00:41:49.359 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
willing to act which could mean
 
00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative go ahead
 
00:42:02.309 --> 00:42:02.319 align:start position:0%
that is not what it says it doesn't say
 
00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:03.599 align:start position:0%
that they're not
 
00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
uh by willing to act means
 
00:42:10.309 --> 00:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
that you can find them it says only
 
00:42:12.069 --> 00:42:12.079 align:start position:0%
after reasonable inquiry that neither a
 
00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
health care agent or durable power of
 
00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
attorney because if those two exist the
 
00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
surrogate does not take effect
 
00:42:19.829 --> 00:42:19.839 align:start position:0%
or a surrogate of higher priority in
 
00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
other words you don't take the
 
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
third cousin and follow what they say
 
00:42:27.349 --> 00:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
if the mother happens to be available
 
00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
and you know that if you are aware that
 
00:42:31.109 --> 00:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
the mother is available
 
00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
and is willing to make that decision
 
00:42:35.589 --> 00:42:35.599 align:start position:0%
they are the higher list
 
00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
higher in that list than the third
 
00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
cousin and therefore
 
00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
they will be the one the person relies
 
00:42:43.349 --> 00:42:43.359 align:start position:0%
upon and it does have a burden of
 
00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:45.200 align:start position:0%
reasonable inquiry you don't just make a
 
00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
willy-nilly decision
 
00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
the practitioner has to do a reasonable
 
00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
inquiry to find out
 
00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
is there a health care agent is there a
 
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
durable power of attorney
 
00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
is there a surrogate of higher priority
 
00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
who is available
 
00:42:59.589 --> 00:42:59.599 align:start position:0%
available means for example they're
 
00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
still alive you can find them
 
00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
they're not in some remote island uh it
 
00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
has never been heard from for 20 years
 
00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:06.309 align:start position:0%
has never been heard from for 20 years
they

00:43:06.309 --> 00:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:43:07.829 --> 00:43:07.839 align:start position:0%
the mother may be alive but not
 
00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
available therefore they're unable or
 
00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:10.870 align:start position:0%
available therefore they're unable or
unwilling

00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
unwilling
 
00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
to act because they're not available and
 
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
also there are some people
 
00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
who may choose they may just say look i
 
00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
can't make this decision
 
00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
i'd like to have my um
 
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
i'm speaking they may be the next in
 
00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
line in surrogacy but they don't feel
 
00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
comfortable making the decision because
 
00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
they don't feel like they know what the
 
00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
right decision is and they
 
00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
they therefore they are not willing to
 
00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
do that and they would pass it
 
00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
to for example a child or a brother or
 
00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
somebody else
 
00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
who they think would be more competent
 
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
to do so
 
00:43:43.589 --> 00:43:43.599 align:start position:0%
that is what that means it doesn't mean
 
00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
the practitioner has the right to pick
 
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
who they have in fact it takes away
 
00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
their right to just pick
 
00:43:53.349 --> 00:43:53.359 align:start position:0%
and declares who they must rely upon
 
00:43:55.109 --> 00:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
and that is according to the order of
 
00:44:03.589 --> 00:44:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
well another really principal
 
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
really critical spot is uh
 
00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
that only medical personnel are named in
 
00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
here to determine
 
00:44:22.069 --> 00:44:22.079 align:start position:0%
whether a person is
 
00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
on who that practitioner is the last
 
00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
time i was in the hospital i was shocked
 
00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
that i wasn't going to see my own doctor
 
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
i was going to see the hospitalist now
 
00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
maybe if we're talking about
 
00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
a person in an assisted living or a
 
00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:35.750 align:start position:0%
a person in an assisted living or a
person

00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
in a nursing home who the hospital is
 
00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
scared to say no the hospitals
 
00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
because that she takes care of all that
 
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
that's one situation
 
00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
but it's only medical personnel who are
 
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
listed in here
 
00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
to determine if somebody is a qualified
 
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
patient there is no reference to
 
00:44:53.589 --> 00:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
any other kind of person which it could
 
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
be the family
 
00:44:57.670 --> 00:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
and it could be their religious leader
 
00:45:01.109 --> 00:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
it's just this is written very
 
00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
clearly from medical care people's point
 
00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:05.430 align:start position:0%
clearly from medical care people's point
of view

00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
of view
 
00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
it needs to be added the family's
 
00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
point of view and it's not i'm not
 
00:45:14.069 --> 00:45:14.079 align:start position:0%
inferring that there was a deliberate
 
00:45:14.079 --> 00:45:14.870 align:start position:0%
inferring that there was a deliberate
attempt

00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
attempt
 
00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
to exclude the same it's accidental
 
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
it's an overlook it means the family
 
00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
needs to be written
 
00:45:25.109 --> 00:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
in here well there's another real simple
 
00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
basic thing uh the list of
 
00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
of potential service
 
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't list the commonwealth whites or
 
00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:37.109 align:start position:0%
doesn't list the commonwealth whites or
spouse

00:45:37.109 --> 00:45:37.119 align:start position:0%
spouse
 
00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
uh in a million other places common law
 
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
does have authority but not here
 
00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
there are many many points like this and
 
00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
i think they deserve to be discussed
 
00:45:52.069 --> 00:45:52.079 align:start position:0%
and clarified you might be able to say
 
00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
wait a minute you're not looking at this
 
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
right this is we wrote this and it is
 
00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:57.109 align:start position:0%
right this is we wrote this and it is
clear

00:45:57.109 --> 00:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
clear
 
00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
see this is what it means um
 
00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
but i think they're just too many and
 
00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
not yeah i wasn't going to say death
 
00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
with dignity because a lot of times we
 
00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
retain bills we don't want to hurt the
 
00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
people's feelings to
 
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
who issued the bill we don't want to
 
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
make them feel bad
 
00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
oh we'll just study it later and then
 
00:46:20.069 --> 00:46:20.079 align:start position:0%
just drop off into nowhere
 
00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
this is critical this meets the past we
 
00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
need to put it in good form
 
00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
and not hope that we can come back and
 
00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:28.640 align:start position:0%
clarify things
 
00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
or address issues i think it be retained
 
00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
because it is important
 
00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
and this way a lot more people can have
 
00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:38.790 align:start position:0%
and this way a lot more people can have
input

00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative the chair
 
00:46:42.069 --> 00:46:42.079 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative
 
00:46:42.079 --> 00:46:46.550 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative
weber

00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman one of the things
 
00:46:49.829 --> 00:46:49.839 align:start position:0%
that i
 
00:46:52.069 --> 00:46:52.079 align:start position:0%
have been informed of over the course of
 
00:46:54.309 --> 00:46:54.319 align:start position:0%
this discussion and i'm sorry i don't
 
00:46:56.309 --> 00:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
have a site is
 
00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:04.200 align:start position:0%
the there is legislative
 
00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
authorization for life-saving clinical
 
00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.270 align:start position:0%
authorization for life-saving clinical
trials

00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:09.280 align:start position:0%
trials
 
00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
which expires in july that was temporary
 
00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
emergency legislation
 
00:47:23.109 --> 00:47:23.119 align:start position:0%
and if we do not pass this bill then
 
00:47:25.349 --> 00:47:25.359 align:start position:0%
that authorization
 
00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
for people to consent to that
 
00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
life-saving trial
 
00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
vanishes at that point so that's another
 
00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:37.109 align:start position:0%
vanishes at that point so that's another
concern

00:47:37.109 --> 00:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
concern
 
00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
for getting things done sooner rather
 
00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
than later
 
00:47:41.589 --> 00:47:41.599 align:start position:0%
and i just wanted to bring that to the
 
00:47:43.349 --> 00:47:43.359 align:start position:0%
committee's attention thank you
 
00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
representative before i
 
00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
we continue with any discussion the
 
00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
chair wishes to acknowledge
 
00:47:52.950 --> 00:47:52.960 align:start position:0%
representative snow is
 
00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
in the room thank you and do you wish to
 
00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:57.030 align:start position:0%
in the room thank you and do you wish to
speak

00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
speak
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
i just have a question um
 
00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
i'm interested in representative
 
00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:03.349 align:start position:0%
i'm interested in representative
kelsey's

00:48:03.349 --> 00:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
kelsey's
 
00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
suggestion with commonwealth lives and
 
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps commonwealth husbands
 
00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
i'm sort of excluded from that but how
 
00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
do we define common law my
 
00:48:14.309 --> 00:48:14.319 align:start position:0%
understanding is a common-law wife is
 
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
somebody who's lived
 
00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
continuously with the same person for
 
00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
over 10 years
 
00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
um but does that mean that anybody that
 
00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:22.720 align:start position:0%
was the west
 
00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if it actually excludes
 
00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
common law wives
 
00:48:28.309 --> 00:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
does it actually say they can't be named
 
00:48:29.589 --> 00:48:29.599 align:start position:0%
it does not say
 
00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
wise it says spouse and on page 25 line
 
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
6. it reads the parent spouse or civil
 
00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
union partner
 
00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:42.640 align:start position:0%
is the number one priority in the
 
00:48:44.309 --> 00:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
decision-making order
 
00:48:47.589 --> 00:48:47.599 align:start position:0%
it strikes the word or common-law spouse
 
00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
as defined by rsa 457 colon 39.
 
00:48:54.549 --> 00:48:54.559 align:start position:0%
it strikes common-law spouse so would
 
00:48:56.710 --> 00:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
that satisfy your concern about that
 
00:48:59.430 --> 00:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
phrase um i think represented so i think
 
00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
that was representative gay that brought
 
00:49:02.069 --> 00:49:02.079 align:start position:0%
up the common law
 
00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
no i do understand i'm only asking the
 
00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
question about that one issue
 
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:16.010 align:start position:0%
that's now covered well
 
00:49:16.010 --> 00:49:17.270 align:start position:0%
that's now covered well
[Music]

00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
it's covered under the heading of civil
 
00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
union partner
 
00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
if they have done that if they
 
00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:26.720 align:start position:0%
is i'm not clear as to whether a civil
 
00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
union partner
 
00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
is the new term for common-law spouse it
 
00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:32.079 align:start position:0%
is not
 
00:49:34.309 --> 00:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
then common-law spouse seems to be
 
00:49:34.319 --> 00:49:35.270 align:start position:0%
then common-law spouse seems to be
stricken

00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
stricken
 
00:49:37.589 --> 00:49:37.599 align:start position:0%
now according to this bill but what what
 
00:49:38.309 --> 00:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
does that mean
 
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
civil union israel for that i thought
 
00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:42.230 align:start position:0%
civil union israel for that i thought
they

00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:49:44.309 --> 00:49:44.319 align:start position:0%
just chose to live together and that's a
 
00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
common thing nowadays that people don't
 
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
get married
 
00:49:49.349 --> 00:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
but agree to live together and i thought
 
00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
that's what that meant
 
00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:52.160 align:start position:0%
representative kelsey thank you mr
 
00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
chairman um so a civil union is
 
00:49:57.990 --> 00:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
actually a it's it's a marriage i mean
 
00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
it's a legal you know you would have um
 
00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
00:50:04.069 --> 00:50:04.079 align:start position:0%
ceremony but common law is just
 
00:50:05.829 --> 00:50:05.839 align:start position:0%
essentially people that they're living
 
00:50:05.839 --> 00:50:06.470 align:start position:0%
essentially people that they're living
together

00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:50:08.549 --> 00:50:08.559 align:start position:0%
that choose not to get married and then
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
it's defined by that ten-year mark
 
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
so then they would have the same rights
 
00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
as anybody that was
 
00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
married so do we need to do we need to
 
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
look at a way of expanding that
 
00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:20.790 align:start position:0%
look at a way of expanding that
definition

00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:20.800 align:start position:0%
definition
 
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
well this isn't going through the actual
 
00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
is that what you're saying we should
 
00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
expand that to include people who choose
 
00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
to live together
 
00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
and we have to put it i mean right now
 
00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
the old definition was
 
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
common law meant you lived together for
 
00:50:38.790 --> 00:50:38.800 align:start position:0%
10 years or longer
 
00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
that seems like a pretty high god yeah
 
00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
10 days is a high back
 
00:50:50.309 --> 00:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
representative cushman thank you mr
 
00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:52.640 align:start position:0%
chairman uh the rsa that's referenced in
 
00:50:53.589 --> 00:50:53.599 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
um where common law spouse is defined
 
00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:56.950 align:start position:0%
um where common law spouse is defined
says

00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
says
 
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
that it is considered persons cohabiting
 
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
and acknowledging each other as husband
 
00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
and wife and generally reputed to be as
 
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
such for the period of three years
 
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
and until the decease of one of them
 
00:51:09.829 --> 00:51:09.839 align:start position:0%
that they
 
00:51:11.109 --> 00:51:11.119 align:start position:0%
shall there after they begin to have
 
00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
been legally married
 
00:51:15.349 --> 00:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
so representative snow that is stricken
 
00:51:15.359 --> 00:51:16.470 align:start position:0%
so representative snow that is stricken
now

00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
in this bill and so this is why some of
 
00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
us would argue for retention
 
00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
that that no longer applies trent
 
00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
that's correct stricken out online uh
 
00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
page 25 line
 
00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:33.190 align:start position:0%
page 25 line
six

00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
anyone else mr chair
 
00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:40.240 align:start position:0%
yes representative if i could just
 
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
circle back one thing which
 
00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
it took me a moment to find the
 
00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
reference and statute
 
00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
um so that i could be certain about this
 
00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:48.230 align:start position:0%
um so that i could be certain about this
but

00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
the conversation we just had a moment
 
00:51:52.069 --> 00:51:52.079 align:start position:0%
ago about page 25
 
00:51:56.230 --> 00:51:56.240 align:start position:0%
lines 19 to 27 and and even further on
 
00:51:58.630 --> 00:51:58.640 align:start position:0%
where we talk about this uh surrogacy
 
00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:00.640 align:start position:0%
and and relying upon which
 
00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
surrogate and reasonable inquiry all of
 
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
that language
 
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
is currently in statute
 
00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
it's not being added so concerns about
 
00:52:11.589 --> 00:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
whether this is
 
00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
something that should be there are not
 
00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:14.720 align:start position:0%
an issue because
 
00:52:17.109 --> 00:52:17.119 align:start position:0%
it's already there the reason it's being
 
00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:18.640 align:start position:0%
changed you may recall
 
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
that in numerous spots through this bill
 
00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
instead of saying the physician pa or
 
00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:24.150 align:start position:0%
instead of saying the physician pa or
aprn

00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
aprn
 
00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
that was always stricken and changed to
 
00:52:27.670 --> 00:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
the bold language which is
 
00:52:29.349 --> 00:52:29.359 align:start position:0%
attending practitioner because that is
 
00:52:31.589 --> 00:52:31.599 align:start position:0%
or just practitioner because that is now
 
00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
the phrase that was chosen to be used in
 
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
this and the reason for that is again to
 
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
give a flexibility
 
00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
in case there's some change in how we
 
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:40.870 align:start position:0%
in case there's some change in how we
define

00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
define
 
00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
who has the ability to be the
 
00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:45.510 align:start position:0%
who has the ability to be the
practitioner

00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
practitioner
 
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
and that attending practitioner is
 
00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
defined early in the bill
 
00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
but throughout the only thing changed
 
00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
here and then there is the bold that
 
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
says in accordance the rsa 137 j6
 
00:52:56.309 --> 00:52:56.319 align:start position:0%
which is the one that says you have to
 
00:52:58.829 --> 00:52:58.839 align:start position:0%
honor the the um
 
00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
preferences of the patient or of the
 
00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:02.710 align:start position:0%
preferences of the patient or of the
principle

00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
principle
 
00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
that were explained to you or expressed
 
00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
to you before so
 
00:53:08.549 --> 00:53:08.559 align:start position:0%
all that discussion we just had about
 
00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
changing this
 
00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:12.640 align:start position:0%
is actually moot because it's not being
 
00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:13.349 align:start position:0%
is actually moot because it's not being
changed

00:53:13.349 --> 00:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
changed
 
00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
it's already there and this is what
 
00:53:17.829 --> 00:53:17.839 align:start position:0%
continues to bother me when see people
 
00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
so i gave it to someone to read
 
00:53:22.549 --> 00:53:22.559 align:start position:0%
well unless they read it and referred
 
00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
back to each statute that's being
 
00:53:25.589 --> 00:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
referred to
 
00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:28.720 align:start position:0%
to read the statute and see what's there
 
00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
they will be confused and there's an art
 
00:53:32.549 --> 00:53:32.559 align:start position:0%
to reading through bills
 
00:53:34.309 --> 00:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
and understanding the references and i
 
00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
had multiple red marks
 
00:53:39.109 --> 00:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
when i read this for myself and then i
 
00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
found it later in the in the bill i said
 
00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
aha it's defined
 
00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
i don't have to worry about that and
 
00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
could cross it off so
 
00:53:47.349 --> 00:53:47.359 align:start position:0%
i would still say that i think the
 
00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
language is clear
 
00:53:51.349 --> 00:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
representative snow
 
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
one of i i notice on page 25
 
00:53:59.750 --> 00:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
line 15
 
00:54:01.109 --> 00:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
there's a new term in there that i
 
00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
hadn't seen before which is a close
 
00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
friend of the patient
 
00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
now i can't imagine a closer friend but
 
00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
somebody you decide to live with and
 
00:54:09.589 --> 00:54:09.599 align:start position:0%
share a life with
 
00:54:11.829 --> 00:54:11.839 align:start position:0%
and would this not also cover gay
 
00:54:11.839 --> 00:54:12.710 align:start position:0%
and would this not also cover gay
couples

00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:12.720 align:start position:0%
couples
 
00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
who share a life together which and that
 
00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:16.470 align:start position:0%
who share a life together which and that
relationship

00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:16.480 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
00:54:18.790 --> 00:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
isn't as clearly defined but at least i
 
00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
think you'd have to consider if two
 
00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
individuals of the same sex were living
 
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
together they would
 
00:54:26.549 --> 00:54:26.559 align:start position:0%
be considered close friends so it seems
 
00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
to me they still could be considered
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
as a possible survey
 
00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
it would be representative snow in my
 
00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
reading of it except
 
00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
on line five there is an order of
 
00:54:39.119 --> 00:54:40.309 align:start position:0%
on line five there is an order of
priority

00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
priority
 
00:54:42.549 --> 00:54:42.559 align:start position:0%
and so a close friend of the patient is
 
00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:44.240 align:start position:0%
priority h
 
00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
in the priority order not priority a
 
00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
as the equivalent to a spouse or civil
 
00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
union partner
 
00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
so that a person living together as
 
00:54:58.069 --> 00:54:58.079 align:start position:0%
common law spouse would come in under
 
00:54:58.630 --> 00:54:58.640 align:start position:0%
friend but
 
00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
way down the list after uh relatives
 
00:55:04.549 --> 00:55:04.559 align:start position:0%
so if that's what you want that's what
 
00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:06.640 align:start position:0%
you've got but if you wish to see
 
00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
common-law spouse
 
00:55:11.349 --> 00:55:11.359 align:start position:0%
as being of equal priority as uh
 
00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
actual spouse or civil union partner you
 
00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
would want
 
00:55:18.390 --> 00:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
to take the strikeout in line
 
00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
six out but as it stands now
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
that person would be way down the list
 
00:55:26.710 --> 00:55:26.720 align:start position:0%
uh representative folsom
 
00:55:29.349 --> 00:55:29.359 align:start position:0%
um i basically was going to speak to the
 
00:55:29.359 --> 00:55:29.829 align:start position:0%
um i basically was going to speak to the
same

00:55:29.829 --> 00:55:29.839 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
exact point um chairman and that
 
00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
in being unfortunately i know too many
 
00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:36.630 align:start position:0%
in being unfortunately i know too many
people

00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:36.640 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
who are not happy about their family
 
00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:40.069 align:start position:0%
who are not happy about their family
members

00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:55:42.069 --> 00:55:42.079 align:start position:0%
living with someone either of the same
 
00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
or opposite sex and would find this as a
 
00:55:45.829 --> 00:55:45.839 align:start position:0%
great opportunity
 
00:55:49.349 --> 00:55:49.359 align:start position:0%
to uh cut them out process
 
00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:52.559 align:start position:0%
thank you representative anyone else
 
00:55:58.069 --> 00:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
can you raise your hands again
 
00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
representative webber

and then nelson representative nelson
 
00:56:08.549 --> 00:56:08.559 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious what happens when
 
00:56:09.910 --> 00:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
there's a divorce
 
00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:12.640 align:start position:0%
somebody's divorced or and you know dies
 
00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
the next day
 
00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:16.559 align:start position:0%
who makes a decision line seven says
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
unless there is a divorce proceedings
 
00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
separation agreement or restraining
 
00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:23.910 align:start position:0%
separation agreement or restraining
order

00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:27.109 --> 00:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
that would nullify uh what says before
 
00:56:30.150 --> 00:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
patient spouse okay thank you
 
00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
welcome representative webber thank you
 
00:56:34.309 --> 00:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
with regard to the common law spouse
 
00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:37.910 align:start position:0%
with regard to the common law spouse
issue

00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
currently our law defines a common law
 
00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:42.309 align:start position:0%
currently our law defines a common law
spouse

00:56:42.309 --> 00:56:42.319 align:start position:0%
spouse
 
00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
as have somebody who has
 
00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
been with the person until they
 
00:56:53.349 --> 00:56:53.359 align:start position:0%
die so they're not the common law spouse
 
00:56:56.829 --> 00:56:56.839 align:start position:0%
until after they're dead so
 
00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
currently the law treats a common law
 
00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:01.670 align:start position:0%
currently the law treats a common law
spouse

00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
spouse
 
00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
as a friend they don't have any priority
 
00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:05.750 align:start position:0%
as a friend they don't have any priority
now

00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
so uh they're not in a worse
 
00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
position by us
 
00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
passing this and of course the way you
 
00:57:19.109 --> 00:57:19.119 align:start position:0%
fix that problem is you
 
00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
have an advance directive and you
 
00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
appoint that person as the person to
 
00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:24.150 align:start position:0%
appoint that person as the person to
make

00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:24.160 align:start position:0%
make
 
00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
the decisions for you we are actually
 
00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
protecting that
 
00:57:31.510 --> 00:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
person more with this than they are
 
00:57:32.710 --> 00:57:32.720 align:start position:0%
protected now
 
00:57:35.829 --> 00:57:35.839 align:start position:0%
so that that's just my my
 
00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
take on that one but i i certainly hope
 
00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:40.230 align:start position:0%
take on that one but i i certainly hope
that

00:57:40.230 --> 00:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
we advance the bill but thank you
 
00:57:45.030 --> 00:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
representative representative cushman
 
00:57:47.589 --> 00:57:47.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i uh maybe i'm
 
00:57:49.109 --> 00:57:49.119 align:start position:0%
wrong with the way i read it is
 
00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
that it's pretty clear
 
00:57:54.789 --> 00:57:54.799 align:start position:0%
and it just says persons cohabitating
 
00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
and acknowledging each other
 
00:57:57.829 --> 00:57:57.839 align:start position:0%
as husband and wife and generally
 
00:57:59.670 --> 00:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
reputed to be as such
 
00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
one of the period of three years and
 
00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:04.720 align:start position:0%
until the decease of one of them
 
00:58:11.109 --> 00:58:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
representative snow wouldn't the some
 
00:58:14.549 --> 00:58:14.559 align:start position:0%
priority be given i mean
 
00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
we're asking the person who this affects
 
00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
the person nearing the end of their life
 
00:58:22.069 --> 00:58:22.079 align:start position:0%
to make some choices
 
00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
it seems to me who they pick if it's a
 
00:58:27.030 --> 00:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
close friend or someone like that
 
00:58:29.510 --> 00:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
they would then be prioritized over any
 
00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
of the other people involved would they
 
00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:31.750 align:start position:0%
of the other people involved would they
not

00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:34.480 align:start position:0%
that's there they've stated in writing
 
00:58:36.069 --> 00:58:36.079 align:start position:0%
and said that this is the person they
 
00:58:36.079 --> 00:58:36.549 align:start position:0%
and said that this is the person they
want

00:58:36.549 --> 00:58:36.559 align:start position:0%
want
 
00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
to be declared first and wouldn't that
 
00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
take priority over anyone else
 
00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
i think this just applies no one is
 
00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:44.870 align:start position:0%
i think this just applies no one is
particularly

00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
clearly named how do you then go down
 
00:58:48.390 --> 00:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
the list
 
00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
you give a brother priority over a
 
00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
commonwealth but if the person
 
00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:55.190 align:start position:0%
commonwealth but if the person
themselves

00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
00:58:57.910 --> 00:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
name who they want do it that would seem
 
00:58:58.870 --> 00:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
to be the
 
00:59:00.630 --> 00:59:00.640 align:start position:0%
main priority there is a place in this
 
00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:10.720 align:start position:0%
representative folsom thank you um thank
 
00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
you chairman uh
 
00:59:16.309 --> 00:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
if the person has filled out the pulse
 
00:59:20.549 --> 00:59:20.559 align:start position:0%
that's the perfect
 
00:59:22.630 --> 00:59:22.640 align:start position:0%
time for them to put that friend's name
 
00:59:23.829 --> 00:59:23.839 align:start position:0%
down because
 
00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
i believe sometimes your friends know
 
00:59:28.309 --> 00:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
better than sometimes your family does
 
00:59:31.510 --> 00:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
um but this has to do with
 
00:59:34.549 --> 00:59:34.559 align:start position:0%
picking a surrogate
 
00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:43.589 --> 00:59:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:46.160 align:start position:0%
representative cushman thank you mr
 
00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:47.109 align:start position:0%
representative cushman thank you mr
chairman

00:59:47.109 --> 00:59:47.119 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:59:50.230 --> 00:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
um so on the on this subject i
 
00:59:52.630 --> 00:59:52.640 align:start position:0%
i think it was representative who was
 
00:59:55.270 --> 00:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
like oh you know we need to get this
 
00:59:57.190 --> 00:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
through so that we have this order but
 
00:59:58.870 --> 00:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
that's already in statute the only thing
 
00:59:59.750 --> 00:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
they changed about
 
01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
the order of picking the surrogate is
 
01:00:03.349 --> 01:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
removing the common law
 
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
um spouse so there already is you know
 
01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:06.710 align:start position:0%
um spouse so there already is you know
this

01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:00:10.069 --> 01:00:10.079 align:start position:0%
kind of hierarchy of who you know
 
01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
is first chosen as the surrogate when
 
01:00:15.190 --> 01:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
there's no advance directive
 
01:00:17.670 --> 01:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
um but uh this still just doesn't
 
01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:18.789 align:start position:0%
um but uh this still just doesn't
address

01:00:18.789 --> 01:00:18.799 align:start position:0%
address
 
01:00:20.710 --> 01:00:20.720 align:start position:0%
you know my a lot of my concerns still
 
01:00:22.069 --> 01:00:22.079 align:start position:0%
haven't been addressed about
 
01:00:25.910 --> 01:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
um you know in static
 
01:00:29.589 --> 01:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
section i'm sorry
 
01:00:32.789 --> 01:00:32.799 align:start position:0%
and on page 18 this is like another one
 
01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
that i didn't get to before about lines
 
01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
11 through 15 the issue applies to the
 
01:00:38.549 --> 01:00:38.559 align:start position:0%
term burden
 
01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
um the term bourbon is used but there's
 
01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
no definition
 
01:00:43.990 --> 01:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
and that's a subjective term so they're
 
01:00:45.589 --> 01:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
saying you know stop
 
01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
my my treatment or my tooth feeding or
 
01:00:52.309 --> 01:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
this when i become so much of a burden i
 
01:00:53.910 --> 01:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
think that the principles idea of a
 
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
burden and agents could be different
 
01:00:58.789 --> 01:00:58.799 align:start position:0%
and it needs to be really clear and they
 
01:01:00.630 --> 01:01:00.640 align:start position:0%
need to offer on the form
 
01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
a way for them to make it very clear
 
01:01:04.069 --> 01:01:04.079 align:start position:0%
exactly what
 
01:01:07.349 --> 01:01:07.359 align:start position:0%
the parameters are for that burden
 
01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
01:01:18.789 --> 01:01:18.799 align:start position:0%
uh yes it doesn't say the patient being
 
01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:20.319 align:start position:0%
a burden
 
01:01:22.630 --> 01:01:22.640 align:start position:0%
it says the burden of treatment so what
 
01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
we're speaking of here is
 
01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
if that's again page 18 line
 
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
12. the burden of treatment may be that
 
01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
it's simply something which
 
01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
is not likely to give them any help and
 
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
will cause them a great deal of pain
 
01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
or discomfort and we all know that
 
01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
people make their own individual
 
01:01:43.109 --> 01:01:43.119 align:start position:0%
decisions about
 
01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
for example how much how far they want
 
01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
to go with chemotherapy treatment and
 
01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
when they have
 
01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
almost no chance of improvement with
 
01:01:51.589 --> 01:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
their fourth round and they're going to
 
01:01:53.589 --> 01:01:53.599 align:start position:0%
be terribly sick they may choose
 
01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
not to take that burden of treatment but
 
01:01:57.029 --> 01:01:57.039 align:start position:0%
we're not speaking about the person
 
01:01:58.069 --> 01:01:58.079 align:start position:0%
being a burden
 
01:01:59.750 --> 01:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
we're speaking of the burden of
 
01:02:01.990 --> 01:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
treatment so they put risks
 
01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
and burdens because the risk may be
 
01:02:06.150 --> 01:02:06.160 align:start position:0%
small but the burden as in the negative
 
01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
aspect to their quality of life could
 
01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
still be high
 
01:02:14.069 --> 01:02:14.079 align:start position:0%
and that is why that person may choose
 
01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
to not have the excessively burdensome
 
01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:19.029 align:start position:0%
to not have the excessively burdensome
treatments

01:02:19.029 --> 01:02:19.039 align:start position:0%
treatments
 
01:02:22.150 --> 01:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative is there anyone
 
01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:25.270 align:start position:0%
thank you representative is there anyone
else

01:02:25.270 --> 01:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman i i would assert that
 
01:02:35.829 --> 01:02:35.839 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
the fact that we are disagreeing right
 
01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
now on
 
01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
on so many of the the points in this
 
01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:43.190 align:start position:0%
on so many of the the points in this
bill

01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
is precisely the reason why it should be
 
01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:46.470 align:start position:0%
is precisely the reason why it should be
retained

01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:46.480 align:start position:0%
retained
 
01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
um not itled
 
01:02:52.950 --> 01:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
nor otp'd but there are a number of
 
01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
open questions that have come up during
 
01:02:58.230 --> 01:02:58.240 align:start position:0%
this conversation
 
01:03:01.349 --> 01:03:01.359 align:start position:0%
and retaining the bill i believe is the
 
01:03:03.349 --> 01:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
most appropriate
 
01:03:06.789 --> 01:03:06.799 align:start position:0%
next step to see that
 
01:03:09.270 --> 01:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
whatever remaining concerns or
 
01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:10.390 align:start position:0%
whatever remaining concerns or
disagreements

01:03:10.390 --> 01:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
disagreements
 
01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
or lack of clarity is
 
01:03:16.549 --> 01:03:16.559 align:start position:0%
resolved so that this bill can move
 
01:03:16.559 --> 01:03:17.190 align:start position:0%
resolved so that this bill can move
forward

01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
at some point after those questions have
 
01:03:20.710 --> 01:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
been answered
 
01:03:22.309 --> 01:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
but the fact that we're we're
 
01:03:24.150 --> 01:03:24.160 align:start position:0%
questioning so much and disagreeing on
 
01:03:27.589 --> 01:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
so much this is a relatively long bill
 
01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot there there's a lot
 
01:03:31.190 --> 01:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
there to question there's a lot there to
 
01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:32.470 align:start position:0%
there to question there's a lot there to
understand

01:03:32.470 --> 01:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
and my concern is that if if we're
 
01:03:37.270 --> 01:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
having this discussion in which we just
 
01:03:38.789 --> 01:03:38.799 align:start position:0%
we're disagreeing on so much of what the
 
01:03:40.870 --> 01:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
bill says and what it means
 
01:03:44.309 --> 01:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
um that to me is is is a clear
 
01:03:47.829 --> 01:03:47.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:57.430 --> 01:03:57.440 align:start position:0%
thank you cushman representative
 
01:03:59.750 --> 01:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um just a couple
 
01:04:01.589 --> 01:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
of final thoughts
 
01:04:04.870 --> 01:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
um so we're having the discussion of the
 
01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:06.309 align:start position:0%
um so we're having the discussion of the
proper

01:04:06.309 --> 01:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
proper
 
01:04:09.430 --> 01:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
process to deal with this
 
01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
understanding that some legislation that
 
01:04:15.829 --> 01:04:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
it's likely that you know as we've seen
 
01:04:19.829 --> 01:04:19.839 align:start position:0%
the governor has
 
01:04:24.390 --> 01:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
dealt with things um unilaterally
 
01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
that especially in the medical field um
 
01:04:30.069 --> 01:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
and i don't see any reason why he
 
01:04:31.029 --> 01:04:31.039 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be
 
01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
forced to issue a new emergency order
 
01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
about something like this um
 
01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
yeah on the the other thing is uh
 
01:04:43.829 --> 01:04:43.839 align:start position:0%
you know we need to this is not
 
01:04:45.029 --> 01:04:45.039 align:start position:0%
something that should be rushed with a
 
01:04:46.309 --> 01:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
floor amendment
 
01:04:49.270 --> 01:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
um you know the next time we go meet in
 
01:04:50.549 --> 01:04:50.559 align:start position:0%
the house could be
 
01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:53.200 align:start position:0%
you know it's in the next month so i
 
01:04:55.829 --> 01:04:55.839 align:start position:0%
think that this needs a little more
 
01:04:59.270 --> 01:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
close examination um
 
01:05:02.789 --> 01:05:02.799 align:start position:0%
you know open discussion and a real like
 
01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
work groups
 
01:05:05.829 --> 01:05:05.839 align:start position:0%
to get get it hammered out to what it
 
01:05:08.069 --> 01:05:08.079 align:start position:0%
needs to be and that a four amendment to
 
01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
fix these issues that we're seeing
 
01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
would be too rushed and i think we need
 
01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
to put it through a proper process of
 
01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
work groups
 
01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
to fix it thank you representative
 
01:05:22.309 --> 01:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
we have two very long builds following
 
01:05:23.190 --> 01:05:23.200 align:start position:0%
this one
 
01:05:25.349 --> 01:05:25.359 align:start position:0%
so unless you have something new to say
 
01:05:27.029 --> 01:05:27.039 align:start position:0%
i would suggest
 
01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
we move to the vote however you have the
 
01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:50.789 --> 01:05:50.799 align:start position:0%
all right thank you mr chair i'll make
 
01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
this really quick um
 
01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
earlier i had no intention of of saying
 
01:05:56.950 --> 01:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
that this
 
01:05:59.829 --> 01:05:59.839 align:start position:0%
bill was being um classified as
 
01:05:59.839 --> 01:06:00.710 align:start position:0%
bill was being um classified as
euthanasia

01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
euthanasia
 
01:06:02.789 --> 01:06:02.799 align:start position:0%
from within this committee it as always
 
01:06:05.109 --> 01:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
we've had a recent discussion
 
01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
i agree with both sides i i think a lot
 
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:06:09.870 --> 01:06:09.880 align:start position:0%
the issues we have here
 
01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
misunderstandings due to the complexity
 
01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
01:06:14.710 --> 01:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
and and that's why i believe that we
 
01:06:17.430 --> 01:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
should move forward and and vote against
 
01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
retaining and carry on from there thank
 
01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:22.549 align:start position:0%

may i sir sir may i ask a question the
 
01:13:56.550 --> 01:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
usual procedure is that the person who
 
01:13:58.470 --> 01:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
makes the motion is the one who writes
 
01:14:01.430 --> 01:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
the blurb unless they wish not to do so
 
01:14:03.430 --> 01:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
should that not be offered to weber
 
01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:04.870 align:start position:0%
should that not be offered to weber
first

01:14:04.870 --> 01:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
it's entirely up ultimately i think it's
 
01:14:10.149 --> 01:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
up to the chairman
 
01:14:12.310 --> 01:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
and i certainly would be glad to defer
 
01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
to representative marsh
 
01:14:17.669 --> 01:14:17.679 align:start position:0%
okay yes and if if he needs any
 
01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
assistance i'd be glad to offer it but i
 
01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
leave it in his competent hands

[Music]

01:19:29.110 --> 01:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:19:31.910 --> 01:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
do you see a picture i see a picture
 
01:19:33.669 --> 01:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
she's not responding
 
01:19:36.790 --> 01:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
okay then comes up and wait tell her to
 
01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:37.910 align:start position:0%
okay then comes up and wait tell her to
wait

01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
wait
 
01:19:40.550 --> 01:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
no it appears to be frozen she may be
 
01:19:41.990 --> 01:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
having hard frozen hardware
 
01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:52.149 align:start position:0%
 
frozen

01:19:52.149 --> 01:19:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:57.590 --> 01:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
and if representative cannon i think
 
01:20:00.950 --> 01:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
wants to add a
 
01:20:03.430 --> 01:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
name to the list later on accept that
 
01:20:05.590 --> 01:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
okay so we have 20 to zero
 
01:20:07.110 --> 01:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
i don't think you can do that i don't
 
01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
think she's present for
 
01:20:11.830 --> 01:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
all purposes mr chair thank you okay but
 
01:20:13.110 --> 01:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's going to change the
 
01:20:14.709 --> 01:20:14.719 align:start position:0%
result at this point
 
01:20:19.510 --> 01:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
we'll try and get hold of her now um
 
01:20:21.910 --> 01:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
i'll entertain another motion to the
 
01:20:23.990 --> 01:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
village the motion to the bill itself
 
01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
chairman representative marsh i move
 
01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:27.750 align:start position:0%
chairman representative marsh i move
that

01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:20:30.870 --> 01:20:30.880 align:start position:0%

representative weber representative
 
01:20:39.270 --> 01:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
marshall may speak
 
01:20:41.990 --> 01:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
to your motion uh yes this uh bill does
 
01:20:44.310 --> 01:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
three things it clarifies medicaid spend
 
01:20:45.350 --> 01:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
down requirements
 
01:20:47.150 --> 01:20:47.160 align:start position:0%
it allows the pharmacy to
 
01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:48.709 align:start position:0%
it allows the pharmacy to
[Music]

01:20:48.709 --> 01:20:48.719 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:20:50.550 --> 01:20:50.560 align:start position:0%
adopt automated pharmacy systems
 
01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
long-term care facilities and las vegas
 
01:20:53.110 --> 01:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
which will
 
01:20:56.149 --> 01:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
say a significant amount of money and
 
01:20:57.910 --> 01:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
holds health care facilities
 
01:21:00.390 --> 01:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
harmless if they acted in accordance
 
01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
with the epidural emergency orders
 
01:21:04.629 --> 01:21:04.639 align:start position:0%
during the government epidemic i believe
 
01:21:05.830 --> 01:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
all those provisions
 
01:21:08.950 --> 01:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
are excellent ones this has
 
01:21:10.870 --> 01:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
clearly been supported by the senate and
 
01:21:12.070 --> 01:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
the congress
 
01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:22.629 --> 01:21:22.639 align:start position:0%
this is the chair speaking i noticed
 
01:21:23.270 --> 01:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
maybe this
 
01:21:27.430 --> 01:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
is overly fussy but on page two
 
01:21:32.149 --> 01:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
line 35 which is the beginning of part 3
 
01:21:35.430 --> 01:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
is the term copit19
 
01:21:40.390 --> 01:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
and while covert 19 may eventually go
 
01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:40.870 align:start position:0%
and while covert 19 may eventually go
away

01:21:40.870 --> 01:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
away
 
01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
kobit 24 may show up or something
 
01:21:44.159 --> 01:21:45.430 align:start position:0%
kobit 24 may show up or something
similar

01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
similar
 
01:21:51.270 --> 01:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:54.229 --> 01:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
it would be wise to have a floor
 
01:21:54.239 --> 01:21:55.189 align:start position:0%
it would be wise to have a floor
amendment

01:21:55.189 --> 01:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:21:58.390 --> 01:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
that would say covert 19
 
01:22:01.830 --> 01:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
or an equivalent pandemic
 
01:22:05.110 --> 01:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
or some word wording and i'm just
 
01:22:06.310 --> 01:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
looking to the committee
 
01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
to see what you think about that um
 
01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
i think that this is a very narrowly uh
 
01:22:15.189 --> 01:22:15.199 align:start position:0%
fashioned uh
 
01:22:17.270 --> 01:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
section to do with what we specifically
 
01:22:18.709 --> 01:22:18.719 align:start position:0%
had to deal with during
 
01:22:21.830 --> 01:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
this year where we uh had to make
 
01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:22.629 align:start position:0%
this year where we uh had to make
decisions

01:22:22.629 --> 01:22:22.639 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
01:22:25.830 --> 01:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
on short notice with limited information
 
01:22:28.229 --> 01:22:28.239 align:start position:0%
and we're all doing the best we can and
 
01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
start to broaden the scope
 
01:22:31.750 --> 01:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
of that section of the law would not be
 
01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate in the long term
 
01:22:36.149 --> 01:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
and if a cover 24 should come up then
 
01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
the legislature at the time can do it
 
01:22:41.350 --> 01:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
my only question about that is here we
 
01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:41.910 align:start position:0%
my only question about that is here we
are

01:22:41.910 --> 01:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
arguably 15 months into the pandemic
 
01:22:48.310 --> 01:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
and we're now adopting this language
 
01:22:49.669 --> 01:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be good to have language
 
01:22:51.350 --> 01:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
like this on the books
 
01:22:54.310 --> 01:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
in month one of the next pandemic that
 
01:22:55.750 --> 01:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
would be arguable and you could file a
 
01:22:57.830 --> 01:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
bill like that
 
01:23:00.070 --> 01:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
all right that's actually what i have in
 
01:23:03.350 --> 01:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:05.910 --> 01:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
any other discussion representative
 
01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:07.110 align:start position:0%
any other discussion representative

01:23:07.110 --> 01:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
cushman
 
01:23:09.510 --> 01:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i went back and
 
01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:10.229 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i went back and
forth

01:23:10.229 --> 01:23:10.239 align:start position:0%
forth
 
01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
on this bill uh specifically over this
 
01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:14.629 align:start position:0%
on this bill uh specifically over this
section

01:23:14.629 --> 01:23:14.639 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:23:15.910 --> 01:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
being a registered nurse and
 
01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
understanding that
 
01:23:20.310 --> 01:23:20.320 align:start position:0%
um medical facilities were kind of under
 
01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:21.350 align:start position:0%
um medical facilities were kind of under
the

01:23:21.350 --> 01:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
the hammer of emergency orders and
 
01:23:28.310 --> 01:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
you know had to comply but um
 
01:23:31.510 --> 01:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
the medical ethics um
 
01:23:35.430 --> 01:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
you know that's a pretty strong
 
01:23:37.830 --> 01:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
um argument against this i think that
 
01:23:39.750 --> 01:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
taking away
 
01:23:42.470 --> 01:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
some responsibility for caring for
 
01:23:44.470 --> 01:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
patients and making the right decisions
 
01:23:47.110 --> 01:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
for patients that don't harm them
 
01:23:50.709 --> 01:23:50.719 align:start position:0%
uh by giving them blanket immunity
 
01:23:52.550 --> 01:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
for just going along with emergency
 
01:23:53.910 --> 01:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
orders is
 
01:23:56.629 --> 01:23:56.639 align:start position:0%
just bad practice i think that every
 
01:23:58.310 --> 01:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
medical professional is responsible for
 
01:24:00.229 --> 01:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
every decision that they make
 
01:24:04.149 --> 01:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
and this would just you know quiet any
 
01:24:07.189 --> 01:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
resistance any legitimate resistance
 
01:24:10.550 --> 01:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
by medical professionals to an emergency
 
01:24:11.430 --> 01:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
order because
 
01:24:13.110 --> 01:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
they know that they're not liable so
 
01:24:14.950 --> 01:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
that takes away a little incentive to
 
01:24:16.629 --> 01:24:16.639 align:start position:0%
fight against it
 
01:24:20.229 --> 01:24:20.239 align:start position:0%
um i i just think
 
01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
that you know if there
 
01:24:25.669 --> 01:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
it's determined that they acted in good
 
01:24:27.110 --> 01:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
faith and
 
01:24:29.350 --> 01:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
you know it should be determined on a
 
01:24:31.590 --> 01:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
case-by-case business basis in a court
 
01:24:32.470 --> 01:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
of law
 
01:24:35.750 --> 01:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
if a family has a reason to believe that
 
01:24:37.910 --> 01:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
some decision that these medical
 
01:24:38.950 --> 01:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
facilities made
 
01:24:40.870 --> 01:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
was responsible for some harm that came
 
01:24:43.270 --> 01:24:43.280 align:start position:0%
to their family members
 
01:24:45.830 --> 01:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
they have a right to bring that support
 
01:24:48.310 --> 01:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
and have it determined by a judge
 
01:24:51.189 --> 01:24:51.199 align:start position:0%
and that giving blank communities is not
 
01:24:52.629 --> 01:24:52.639 align:start position:0%
the way to go about this and
 
01:24:54.390 --> 01:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't just be like giving them a
 
01:24:55.990 --> 01:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
free cover but
 
01:24:59.350 --> 01:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
for you know decisions that potentially
 
01:25:00.709 --> 01:25:00.719 align:start position:0%
could have been harmful whether there
 
01:25:00.719 --> 01:25:01.110 align:start position:0%
could have been harmful whether there
was

01:25:01.110 --> 01:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:25:06.229 --> 01:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
an emergency order in place or not
 
01:25:09.030 --> 01:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
yeah representative marsh yes thank you
 
01:25:09.669 --> 01:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
01:25:11.590 --> 01:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
section of the bill was drafted by a
 
01:25:13.830 --> 01:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
threat based uh group of
 
01:25:16.629 --> 01:25:16.639 align:start position:0%
stakeholders including the trial lawyers
 
01:25:16.639 --> 01:25:17.430 align:start position:0%

01:25:19.510 --> 01:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
i find it rather hard to believe that i
 
01:25:20.550 --> 01:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh finding myself in agreement with the
 
01:25:23.669 --> 01:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
trial lawyers
 
01:25:25.270 --> 01:25:25.280 align:start position:0%
association but i think that they were
 
01:25:26.709 --> 01:25:26.719 align:start position:0%
very careful
 
01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they did not
 
01:25:32.550 --> 01:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
compromise the rights of individuals who
 
01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:32.950 align:start position:0%
compromise the rights of individuals who
may

01:25:32.950 --> 01:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
may
 
01:25:35.490 --> 01:25:35.500 align:start position:0%
have actually suffered
 
01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:37.750 align:start position:0%
have actually suffered
[Music]

01:25:37.750 --> 01:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:25:40.790 --> 01:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
malpractice or some other event at the
 
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
hands of
 
01:25:44.310 --> 01:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
medical professionals except for
 
01:25:46.149 --> 01:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
uh the fact that mental knowledge may
 
01:25:48.070 --> 01:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
have changed and it may have changed
 
01:25:50.229 --> 01:25:50.239 align:start position:0%
dramatically over the last year
 
01:25:52.470 --> 01:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh so i i think considering the number
 
01:25:54.229 --> 01:25:54.239 align:start position:0%
of people input has gone into the
 
01:25:56.070 --> 01:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
section it's very appropriate
 
01:25:59.350 --> 01:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
but i i i'm afraid i would not apply
 
01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
that to a broader scope as the chairman
 
01:26:03.750 --> 01:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
has suggested please not without going
 
01:26:06.870 --> 01:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
back to the state with this discussion
 
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative anyone else for
 
01:26:10.709 --> 01:26:10.719 align:start position:0%
the handoff
 
01:26:15.189 --> 01:26:15.199 align:start position:0%
uh representative representative
 
01:26:18.550 --> 01:26:18.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh normally
 
01:26:21.990 --> 01:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
i i'm not a big fan of omnibus bills but
 
01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
seeing the situation we've been in with
 
01:26:25.270 --> 01:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
with cove
 
01:26:26.790 --> 01:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
we really had no choice i'd like to
 
01:26:30.310 --> 01:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
thank dhhs for not sneaking in
 
01:26:32.550 --> 01:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
any poison pills or any funny business
 
01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
here that allows us to clean up
 
01:26:37.990 --> 01:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
pass a clean bill um my only
 
01:26:39.910 --> 01:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
the only issue i had was that we started
 
01:26:41.189 --> 01:26:41.199 align:start position:0%
building an
 
01:26:43.910 --> 01:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
omnibus uh amendment that where we
 
01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
started putting all the
 
01:26:47.669 --> 01:26:47.679 align:start position:0%
any issues into one big amendment and
 
01:26:47.679 --> 01:26:48.790 align:start position:0%
any issues into one big amendment and
that

01:26:48.790 --> 01:26:48.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:26:51.030 --> 01:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
takes away our ability to individually
 
01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:51.990 align:start position:0%
takes away our ability to individually
address

01:26:51.990 --> 01:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
address
 
01:26:53.990 --> 01:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment so i hope in the future we
 
01:26:55.189 --> 01:26:55.199 align:start position:0%
can move away from both
 
01:26:57.910 --> 01:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
both practices but um and then finally
 
01:26:57.920 --> 01:26:58.310 align:start position:0%
both practices but um and then finally
uh

01:26:58.310 --> 01:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:27:00.229 --> 01:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
you know the one issue i had is that
 
01:27:01.910 --> 01:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
once again with with therapeutic
 
01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:03.030 align:start position:0%
once again with with therapeutic
cannabis

01:27:03.030 --> 01:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
01:27:06.149 --> 01:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
these were department requested changes
 
01:27:08.550 --> 01:27:08.560 align:start position:0%
um certainly very reasonable and and i
 
01:27:11.510 --> 01:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
just i have a problem with the continued
 
01:27:15.669 --> 01:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
um practice of of treating
 
01:27:18.149 --> 01:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
patients and and atc's and people
 
01:27:20.070 --> 01:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
involved in the program like we're
 
01:27:22.149 --> 01:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
like we're gonna go out and if we're not
 
01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
constrained by
 
01:27:26.870 --> 01:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
um specific regulatory
 
01:27:28.790 --> 01:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
burdens we're gonna go out and just uh
 
01:27:30.550 --> 01:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
commit crimes left and right uh
 
01:27:32.709 --> 01:27:32.719 align:start position:0%
there's a major felony for diversion
 
01:27:33.990 --> 01:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
from the program
 
01:27:37.189 --> 01:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
um the need to
 
01:27:40.149 --> 01:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
keep these um tight uh production
 
01:27:40.950 --> 01:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
controls on
 
01:27:43.910 --> 01:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
on the atcs didn't really make sense to
 
01:27:45.350 --> 01:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
me because
 
01:27:47.669 --> 01:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
atcs are highly regulated they would
 
01:27:49.270 --> 01:27:49.280 align:start position:0%
they would lose everything if there was
 
01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:49.830 align:start position:0%
they would lose everything if there was
any

01:27:49.830 --> 01:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:27:53.110 --> 01:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
any diversion from from their level
 
01:27:56.550 --> 01:27:56.560 align:start position:0%
so ultimately um put making
 
01:27:59.270 --> 01:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
such an issue about the constraints on
 
01:28:01.189 --> 01:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
on their production
 
01:28:04.550 --> 01:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
i think unfairly um
 
01:28:06.870 --> 01:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
cast an aspersion on them in a sense
 
01:28:08.310 --> 01:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
where they
 
01:28:10.470 --> 01:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
where we feel that we have to control
 
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
them we're also going to be selling it
 
01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
out the back door to the black market
 
01:28:15.030 --> 01:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
and there's no evidence of that at all
 
01:28:16.709 --> 01:28:16.719 align:start position:0%
so i hope we don't do that
 
01:28:18.149 --> 01:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
i think we're on the wrong bill that's
 
01:28:20.470 --> 01:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
on 162.
 
01:28:23.669 --> 01:28:23.679 align:start position:0%
representative i'm not
 
01:28:25.750 --> 01:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
i am not calling on anyone

and not the president
 
01:28:33.030 --> 01:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
right oh okay well um sorry about that
 
01:28:35.110 --> 01:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
okay we'll remember what you said though
 
01:28:37.030 --> 01:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
all right i i won't repeat it then uh
 
01:28:38.709 --> 01:28:38.719 align:start position:0%
you guys know what i'm feeling here
 
01:28:41.590 --> 01:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
sorry about that okay representative

01:28:47.270 --> 01:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
i have a question a very simple answer
 
01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:47.830 align:start position:0%
i have a question a very simple answer
for

01:28:47.830 --> 01:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:28:51.110 --> 01:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
i was a sponsor of a bill to upgrade
 
01:28:54.390 --> 01:28:54.400 align:start position:0%
the threshold for
 
01:28:57.030 --> 01:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
implementation of medicaid in and out
 
01:28:57.750 --> 01:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
and there was some
 
01:28:59.830 --> 01:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
change it was included in this around
 
01:29:01.110 --> 01:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
the funding and i hope
 
01:29:03.430 --> 01:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
it didn't impact the idea that that bill
 
01:29:05.430 --> 01:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
which was passed
 
01:29:07.030 --> 01:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
in the last session signed by the
 
01:29:08.629 --> 01:29:08.639 align:start position:0%
governor to do it
 
01:29:11.270 --> 01:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
be implemented as of joel june 30th of
 
01:29:14.149 --> 01:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:17.669 --> 01:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
there was some clarity about
 
01:29:18.870 --> 01:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
whether money was going to be in the
 
01:29:20.470 --> 01:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
budget or not in the budget it's going
 
01:29:21.830 --> 01:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
to have to be paid for
 
01:29:24.709 --> 01:29:24.719 align:start position:0%
on some other it doesn't have to be page
 
01:29:25.830 --> 01:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
is there anything about
 
01:29:27.830 --> 01:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
the change that is incorporated in this
 
01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
bill i was told
 
01:29:30.550 --> 01:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't impact the
 
01:29:32.550 --> 01:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
implementation of that bill but i just
 
01:29:34.070 --> 01:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
like reassurance
 
01:29:36.870 --> 01:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
at this point if representative nash
 
01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:39.030 align:start position:0%
at this point if representative nash
commented

01:29:39.030 --> 01:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
commented
 
01:29:41.030 --> 01:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that this does not
 
01:29:43.189 --> 01:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
impact the implementation of that other
 
01:29:43.199 --> 01:29:44.470 align:start position:0%
impact the implementation of that other

01:29:48.390 --> 01:29:48.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative

sorry about that the the first part of
 
01:30:01.990 --> 01:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:30:04.870 --> 01:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
which was inserted by uh senator
 
01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:06.310 align:start position:0%
which was inserted by uh senator

01:30:06.310 --> 01:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
rosenwald
 
01:30:11.030 --> 01:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh simply makes it exceedingly clear
 
01:30:14.550 --> 01:30:14.560 align:start position:0%
that um um
 
01:30:18.709 --> 01:30:18.719 align:start position:0%
now wait a minute i've lost it again uh
 
01:30:23.110 --> 01:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
that that it it makes it clear
 
01:30:26.790 --> 01:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
that um mental health expenses are
 
01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:27.590 align:start position:0%
that um mental health expenses are
included

01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
included
 
01:30:30.149 --> 01:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
so it strengthens what we did before and
 
01:30:32.830 --> 01:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
clarifies but it doesn't actually change
 
01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:35.189 align:start position:0%
clarifies but it doesn't actually change
anything

01:30:35.189 --> 01:30:35.199 align:start position:0%
anything

thank you this amendment does three

things first of all it clarifies
 
01:49:06.070 --> 01:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
language in section 12 of the bill so
 
01:49:08.229 --> 01:49:08.239 align:start position:0%
that canvas registry identification
 
01:49:09.030 --> 01:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
cards do not
 
01:49:11.590 --> 01:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
inadvertently uh become a license to

sell cigarettes
 
01:49:16.629 --> 01:49:16.639 align:start position:0%
to use in the state of new hampshire
 
01:49:18.550 --> 01:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
in its language which the department has
 
01:49:20.950 --> 01:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
agreed to clarify that section just
 
01:49:23.189 --> 01:49:23.199 align:start position:0%
make sure that consequence does not
 
01:49:23.199 --> 01:49:24.790 align:start position:0%
make sure that consequence does not
happen

01:49:24.790 --> 01:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:49:27.030 --> 01:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
the second section of this amendment
 
01:49:28.229 --> 01:49:28.239 align:start position:0%
deals with the fact that
 
01:49:30.709 --> 01:49:30.719 align:start position:0%
section 48 of the bill as he received it
 
01:49:32.149 --> 01:49:32.159 align:start position:0%
was incomplete
 
01:49:35.189 --> 01:49:35.199 align:start position:0%
it only uh it was an amended delete
 
01:49:37.270 --> 01:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
section to rsa 170
 
01:49:42.470 --> 01:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
a and they only put in 178 colon one
 
01:49:44.629 --> 01:49:44.639 align:start position:0%
and then put in language for eight two
 
01:49:45.910 --> 01:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
three seven
 
01:49:48.229 --> 01:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
so i'll work with the department to
 
01:49:50.709 --> 01:49:50.719 align:start position:0%
complete that section of the bill
 
01:49:53.830 --> 01:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
the last section of the bill adds
 
01:49:56.790 --> 01:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
a requirement for evaluations for
 
01:49:56.800 --> 01:49:58.070 align:start position:0%
a requirement for evaluations for
children

01:49:58.070 --> 01:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:50:05.990 --> 01:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:10.310 --> 01:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
the federal first prevention services
 
01:50:12.870 --> 01:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
act uh this is the public requested
 
01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:13.830 align:start position:0%
act uh this is the public requested
language

01:50:13.830 --> 01:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:50:15.589 --> 01:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
uh my understanding was that they
 
01:50:17.270 --> 01:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
initially intended to
 
01:50:20.390 --> 01:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
add this to house bill 120 as parallel
 
01:50:22.709 --> 01:50:22.719 align:start position:0%
to language that's in my bill hospital
 
01:50:23.990 --> 01:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
when 20 requiring
 
01:50:26.550 --> 01:50:26.560 align:start position:0%
similar evaluations for children before
 
01:50:28.629 --> 01:50:28.639 align:start position:0%
they're put on psychotropic medications
 
01:50:30.229 --> 01:50:30.239 align:start position:0%
however the senate had already passed
 
01:50:32.070 --> 01:50:32.080 align:start position:0%
that bill by the time
 
01:50:33.990 --> 01:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
this language was forward and therefore
 
01:50:36.070 --> 01:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
this was thought to be an
 
01:50:39.109 --> 01:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
alternative for that the purpose is that
 
01:50:39.119 --> 01:50:39.510 align:start position:0%
alternative for that the purpose is that
this

01:50:39.510 --> 01:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:50:41.589 --> 01:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
language is required to access titles

um
 
01:53:38.870 --> 01:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
that i brought forward because i was
 
01:53:40.470 --> 01:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
being approached to
 
01:53:43.189 --> 01:53:43.199 align:start position:0%
with regarding two major sections of the
 
01:53:43.199 --> 01:53:43.830 align:start position:0%
with regarding two major sections of the
cannabis

01:53:43.830 --> 01:53:43.840 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
01:53:49.030 --> 01:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:51.830 --> 01:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
basically had quite a few problems and
 
01:53:51.840 --> 01:53:52.229 align:start position:0%
basically had quite a few problems and
those

01:53:52.229 --> 01:53:52.239 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:53:55.030 --> 01:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
two main problems that kept coming up
 
01:53:56.149 --> 01:53:56.159 align:start position:0%
with people
 
01:53:59.430 --> 01:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
were one the fact that
 
01:54:03.189 --> 01:54:03.199 align:start position:0%
because we're eliminating the fact that
 
01:54:03.199 --> 01:54:04.229 align:start position:0%
because we're eliminating the fact that
patients

01:54:04.229 --> 01:54:04.239 align:start position:0%
patients
 
01:54:07.350 --> 01:54:07.360 align:start position:0%
have to be designated to an atc there
 
01:54:07.990 --> 01:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
would be no
 
01:54:11.030 --> 01:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
way to track those patients and how much
 
01:54:12.470 --> 01:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
they're purchasing
 
01:54:15.669 --> 01:54:15.679 align:start position:0%
at other ats possibly purchasing at
 
01:54:17.189 --> 01:54:17.199 align:start position:0%
other atcs
 
01:54:18.950 --> 01:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
for the total amount that they're
 
01:54:20.950 --> 01:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
allowed each time
 
01:54:24.390 --> 01:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
and the other major issue was the fact
 
01:54:24.400 --> 01:54:25.350 align:start position:0%
and the other major issue was the fact
that

01:54:25.350 --> 01:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:54:29.350 --> 01:54:29.360 align:start position:0%
now that there was uh no designation
 
01:54:33.350 --> 01:54:33.360 align:start position:0%
every single qualifying patient
 
01:54:37.430 --> 01:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
um was now every single person who had a
 
01:54:39.669 --> 01:54:39.679 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana medical
 
01:54:42.790 --> 01:54:42.800 align:start position:0%
cannabis card which meant
 
01:54:47.750 --> 01:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
that um with seven atc's instead of
 
01:54:50.629 --> 01:54:50.639 align:start position:0%
there being enough cannabis grown and
 
01:54:52.310 --> 01:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
supported for 11
 
01:54:56.629 --> 01:54:56.639 align:start position:0%
000 patients it would be the possibility
 
01:55:00.470 --> 01:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
of enough cannabis being produced
 
01:55:04.070 --> 01:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:55:07.510 --> 01:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
having the supply on hand for 77
 
01:55:10.550 --> 01:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
000 uh people
 
01:55:14.149 --> 01:55:14.159 align:start position:0%
and so those were the two
 
01:55:16.229 --> 01:55:16.239 align:start position:0%
main things that i kept hearing over and
 
01:55:18.870 --> 01:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
over again from people
 
01:55:21.990 --> 01:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
the first part i really feel
 
01:55:25.910 --> 01:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
that i believe that the
 
01:55:29.350 --> 01:55:29.360 align:start position:0%
patients who use cannabis should be
 
01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:30.149 align:start position:0%
patients who use cannabis should be
allowed

01:55:30.149 --> 01:55:30.159 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
01:55:33.430 --> 01:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
to purchase it at any one of those atc's
 
01:55:36.310 --> 01:55:36.320 align:start position:0%
i strongly believe that i believe that's
 
01:55:39.350 --> 01:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
not an issue my issue is is that
 
01:55:42.470 --> 01:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
they have put no place no uh
 
01:55:45.750 --> 01:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
rules in place as to how to track it
 
01:55:47.510 --> 01:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
just like you would track any other
 
01:55:51.910 --> 01:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
medication in the state of new hampshire
 
01:55:54.470 --> 01:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
i was told that it would be too
 
01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:56.390 align:start position:0%
i was told that it would be too
expensive

01:55:56.390 --> 01:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
01:55:59.109 --> 01:55:59.119 align:start position:0%
well the research i've been doing with
 
01:56:00.149 --> 01:56:00.159 align:start position:0%
other growers
 
01:56:03.270 --> 01:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
and providers the amount that
 
01:56:06.470 --> 01:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
our new
 
01:56:10.550 --> 01:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
atc our atcs charge
 
01:56:14.070 --> 01:56:14.080 align:start position:0%
there would be more than enough money
 
01:56:17.669 --> 01:56:17.679 align:start position:0%
to cover that cost and it would not be a
 
01:56:19.990 --> 01:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
difficult cost
 
01:56:23.189 --> 01:56:23.199 align:start position:0%
i can go into a home depot here in new
 
01:56:23.199 --> 01:56:24.310 align:start position:0%
i can go into a home depot here in new
hampshire

01:56:24.310 --> 01:56:24.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:56:28.070 --> 01:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
and buy some paint for my bedroom
 
01:56:31.750 --> 01:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
and if i wanted to
 
01:56:34.149 --> 01:56:34.159 align:start position:0%
paint my friend's bedroom the same color
 
01:56:36.470 --> 01:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
when i'm visiting her in colorado
 
01:56:38.790 --> 01:56:38.800 align:start position:0%
i can go into a home depot there and go
 
01:56:41.270 --> 01:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
oh what was the color of my paint
 
01:56:43.750 --> 01:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
and how much did i need to buy to use do
 
01:56:44.790 --> 01:56:44.800 align:start position:0%
that room
 
01:56:47.030 --> 01:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
and lo and behold in about less than a
 
01:56:48.310 --> 01:56:48.320 align:start position:0%
minute they could tell me
 
01:56:51.750 --> 01:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
that amount so i do not believe
 
01:56:55.510 --> 01:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
that um what
 
01:56:58.470 --> 01:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
we're being told as being an exorbitant
 
01:56:58.480 --> 01:56:59.109 align:start position:0%
we're being told as being an exorbitant
expense

01:56:59.109 --> 01:56:59.119 align:start position:0%
expense
 
01:57:02.229 --> 01:57:02.239 align:start position:0%
necessarily is one uh
 
01:57:05.350 --> 01:57:05.360 align:start position:0%
the other thing about the uh the second
 
01:57:09.910 --> 01:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
issue uh with regards to the amount
 
01:57:12.950 --> 01:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
i was basically told that
 
01:57:16.070 --> 01:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
why would the organizations
 
01:57:19.910 --> 01:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
that have this cannabis and are
 
01:57:23.750 --> 01:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
licensed want to grow more
 
01:57:27.109 --> 01:57:27.119 align:start position:0%
than they would actually sell
 
01:57:29.669 --> 01:57:29.679 align:start position:0%
and but yet they still want an increase
 
01:57:31.270 --> 01:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
in the amount that they can
 
01:57:34.550 --> 01:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
they have on hand uh because they would
 
01:57:36.870 --> 01:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
have to destroy it
 
01:57:40.229 --> 01:57:40.239 align:start position:0%
however i am not satisfied
 
01:57:43.669 --> 01:57:43.679 align:start position:0%
with the whole management of the program
 
01:57:48.550 --> 01:57:48.560 align:start position:0%
and i trust the patients inside and out
 
01:57:51.750 --> 01:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
but on my own i'm going to start looking
 
01:57:53.589 --> 01:57:53.599 align:start position:0%
at some of the companies
 
01:57:56.709 --> 01:57:56.719 align:start position:0%
that are running the program and
 
01:57:59.910 --> 01:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
and seeing if if the way they're running
 
01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:00.550 align:start position:0%
and seeing if if the way they're running
them

01:58:00.550 --> 01:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:58:03.430 --> 01:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
are being run according to good
 
01:58:03.440 --> 01:58:05.189 align:start position:0%
are being run according to good
practices

01:58:05.189 --> 01:58:05.199 align:start position:0%
practices
 
01:58:08.149 --> 01:58:08.159 align:start position:0%
and if they are i will congratulate them
 
01:58:08.159 --> 01:58:08.470 align:start position:0%
and if they are i will congratulate them
and

01:58:08.470 --> 01:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:58:11.669 --> 01:58:11.679 align:start position:0%
if they're not this is one area where i
 
01:58:14.870 --> 01:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
would be very comfortable limiting their
 
01:58:19.830 --> 01:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:22.470 --> 01:58:22.480 align:start position:0%
at that point uh so those those are my
 
01:58:24.229 --> 01:58:24.239 align:start position:0%
two main points on this and i'd love to
 
01:58:26.149 --> 01:58:26.159 align:start position:0%
hear what other people think
 
01:58:28.070 --> 01:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any comments
 
01:58:29.510 --> 01:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
01:58:34.310 --> 01:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question um i
 
01:58:37.669 --> 01:58:37.679 align:start position:0%
thought that you had two two potential
 
01:58:37.679 --> 01:58:39.910 align:start position:0%
thought that you had two two potential
amendments

01:58:39.910 --> 01:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
01:58:43.430 --> 01:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
is this the one that would uh allow them
 
01:58:46.870 --> 01:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
to allow the atcs to
 
01:58:50.070 --> 01:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
produce a lot more like three times as
 
01:58:50.080 --> 01:58:50.360 align:start position:0%
produce a lot more like three times as
much

01:58:50.360 --> 01:58:50.370 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:58:50.370 --> 01:58:51.910 align:start position:0%
much
[Music]

01:58:51.910 --> 01:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:58:54.709 --> 01:58:54.719 align:start position:0%
or is this the one that would maintain
 
01:58:54.719 --> 01:58:55.350 align:start position:0%
or is this the one that would maintain
their

01:58:55.350 --> 01:58:55.360 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:58:57.990 --> 01:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
current amount for the eight for the
 
01:59:00.070 --> 01:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
people who are assigned to them
 
01:59:03.350 --> 01:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
and as you think of the answer to that
 
01:59:06.629 --> 01:59:06.639 align:start position:0%
uh i was surprised to learn that already
 
01:59:09.669 --> 01:59:09.679 align:start position:0%
on the state website
 
01:59:12.470 --> 01:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh where it lists all the atc's that
 
01:59:14.629 --> 01:59:14.639 align:start position:0%
they're actually in pairs
 
01:59:18.229 --> 01:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
and so currently any person who has a
 
01:59:18.239 --> 01:59:19.109 align:start position:0%
and so currently any person who has a
card

01:59:19.109 --> 01:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
card
 
01:59:22.070 --> 01:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
to one of these pairs can go to each
 
01:59:26.149 --> 01:59:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:29.589 --> 01:59:29.599 align:start position:0%
either of the two or both excuse me
 
01:59:32.470 --> 01:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
so which if you could clarify which
 
01:59:33.189 --> 01:59:33.199 align:start position:0%
agreement this
 
01:59:36.550 --> 01:59:36.560 align:start position:0%
is okay this amendment basically um
 
01:59:39.270 --> 01:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
takes out the section which uh removes
 
01:59:41.669 --> 01:59:41.679 align:start position:0%
the designation of atc
 
01:59:45.270 --> 01:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
so in doing that the
 
01:59:48.149 --> 01:59:48.159 align:start position:0%
they would the atcs would have to use
 
01:59:50.229 --> 01:59:50.239 align:start position:0%
just their qualifying patients
 
01:59:52.950 --> 01:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
as their multiplying factor with regards
 
01:59:54.629 --> 01:59:54.639 align:start position:0%
to seeds and plants
 
01:59:58.709 --> 01:59:58.719 align:start position:0%
and product the fact that
 
02:00:02.149 --> 02:00:02.159 align:start position:0%
you see on the website uh that
 
02:00:05.669 --> 02:00:05.679 align:start position:0%
you have some pairs that they can go to
 
02:00:09.430 --> 02:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
i believe and i'm not 100 sure on this
 
02:00:11.430 --> 02:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
but i believe that's because
 
02:00:13.990 --> 02:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
out of the seven atc's there are only
 
02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:15.109 align:start position:0%
out of the seven atc's there are only
four

02:00:15.109 --> 02:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
four
 
02:00:18.229 --> 02:00:18.239 align:start position:0%
um licensures so there's some
 
02:00:20.950 --> 02:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
companies that own more than one and i
 
02:00:22.030 --> 02:00:22.040 align:start position:0%
think they're using
 
02:00:27.189 --> 02:00:27.199 align:start position:0%
a loophole to be able to pull that off
 
02:00:31.750 --> 02:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:33.750 --> 02:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up so this is the more
 
02:00:35.830 --> 02:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
restrictive this is the more
 
02:00:39.830 --> 02:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
this is this is more restrictive yes
 
02:00:42.550 --> 02:00:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:45.030 --> 02:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh representative mark i would like to
 
02:00:46.629 --> 02:00:46.639 align:start position:0%
ask if we could have the opinion of the
 
02:00:49.589 --> 02:00:49.599 align:start position:0%
department on this language and i also
 
02:00:50.950 --> 02:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
would like to make a comment about the
 
02:00:53.270 --> 02:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
word loophole it is my recollection that
 
02:00:55.189 --> 02:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
you passed a specific bill i think
 
02:00:58.229 --> 02:00:58.239 align:start position:0%
this last session that allowed the atcs
 
02:00:59.990 --> 02:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
to have a second location so that was
 
02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:01.589 align:start position:0%
to have a second location so that was
not

02:01:01.589 --> 02:01:01.599 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:01:05.270 --> 02:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
right may i speak mr chair to answer
 
02:01:06.709 --> 02:01:06.719 align:start position:0%
some of these questions too
 
02:01:06.719 --> 02:01:13.030 align:start position:0%
some of these questions too
a

02:01:13.030 --> 02:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:15.430 --> 02:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative folsom may answer
 
02:01:17.270 --> 02:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
representative marsha's
 
02:01:19.669 --> 02:01:19.679 align:start position:0%
statement okay i can tell you a little
 
02:01:21.350 --> 02:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
bit about dhhs
 
02:01:23.430 --> 02:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
has to say because i had conversations
 
02:01:24.910 --> 02:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
with three people at ds
 
02:01:28.550 --> 02:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
dhhs they are against
 
02:01:31.589 --> 02:01:31.599 align:start position:0%
this amendment they feel
 
02:01:35.669 --> 02:01:35.679 align:start position:0%
that the rights of the patient
 
02:01:37.750 --> 02:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
which i even said right at the beginning
 
02:01:39.510 --> 02:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
are very important
 
02:01:43.430 --> 02:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
that um they uh
 
02:01:47.030 --> 02:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
do not want that limited and therefore
 
02:01:47.750 --> 02:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
we need to
 
02:01:50.550 --> 02:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
do it for the patients but they do not
 
02:01:53.189 --> 02:01:53.199 align:start position:0%
have any rules in place
 
02:01:55.990 --> 02:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
to manage that system that's right they
 
02:01:56.950 --> 02:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
have nothing
 
02:01:58.470 --> 02:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
they don't even know the rules written
 
02:02:00.229 --> 02:02:00.239 align:start position:0%
so that
 
02:02:03.350 --> 02:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
that is what is happening there
 
02:02:07.030 --> 02:02:07.040 align:start position:0%
and the reason why they initially
 
02:02:10.149 --> 02:02:10.159 align:start position:0%
did not want any limitations on
 
02:02:13.189 --> 02:02:13.199 align:start position:0%
the amount of cannabis that each center
 
02:02:14.709 --> 02:02:14.719 align:start position:0%
could grow
 
02:02:18.149 --> 02:02:18.159 align:start position:0%
was because some centers have
 
02:02:21.430 --> 02:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
more patients than others
 
02:02:25.189 --> 02:02:25.199 align:start position:0%
so one patient one center may need
 
02:02:28.709 --> 02:02:28.719 align:start position:0%
to produce and have more
 
02:02:32.149 --> 02:02:32.159 align:start position:0%
but with the qualifying patient still in
 
02:02:32.159 --> 02:02:32.550 align:start position:0%
but with the qualifying patient still in
place

02:02:32.550 --> 02:02:32.560 align:start position:0%
place
 
02:02:35.589 --> 02:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
those those numbers still stay higher
 
02:02:38.070 --> 02:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
for those atc's
 
02:02:40.790 --> 02:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
i would like it if this was removed this
 
02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:41.189 align:start position:0%
i would like it if this was removed this
time

02:02:41.189 --> 02:02:41.199 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:02:44.950 --> 02:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
and we come back at another point
 
02:02:48.070 --> 02:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
when the rules are in place when
 
02:02:51.750 --> 02:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
the process in place for tracking and
 
02:02:54.310 --> 02:02:54.320 align:start position:0%
uh where we're set to manage the amount
 
02:02:55.830 --> 02:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
of cannabis
 
02:02:58.870 --> 02:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
being produced and available
 
02:03:00.470 --> 02:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative the chair
 
02:03:03.669 --> 02:03:03.679 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative penarch
 
02:03:07.109 --> 02:03:07.119 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um just to clarify a
 
02:03:08.310 --> 02:03:08.320 align:start position:0%
couple things first of all rules are
 
02:03:10.310 --> 02:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
written after the legislation passes
 
02:03:11.990 --> 02:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
because otherwise our
 
02:03:13.910 --> 02:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
committee sorry our department should be
 
02:03:16.149 --> 02:03:16.159 align:start position:0%
doing a lot of rules for no good reason
 
02:03:17.990 --> 02:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
so sure there are not rules it's
 
02:03:19.350 --> 02:03:19.360 align:start position:0%
important to understand that the whole
 
02:03:20.629 --> 02:03:20.639 align:start position:0%
goal of allowing people to go to
 
02:03:22.629 --> 02:03:22.639 align:start position:0%
different atc's
 
02:03:25.109 --> 02:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
is to increase the choice the patient
 
02:03:26.550 --> 02:03:26.560 align:start position:0%
freedom of choice
 
02:03:29.510 --> 02:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
to go to the atc that they wish to for
 
02:03:31.189 --> 02:03:31.199 align:start position:0%
two reasons basically
 
02:03:34.070 --> 02:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
one is one atc may have a different
 
02:03:34.080 --> 02:03:35.109 align:start position:0%
one is one atc may have a different
strain

02:03:35.109 --> 02:03:35.119 align:start position:0%
strain
 
02:03:37.510 --> 02:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
with a certain cannabinoid profile and
 
02:03:37.520 --> 02:03:38.550 align:start position:0%
with a certain cannabinoid profile and
terpenes

02:03:38.550 --> 02:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
terpenes
 
02:03:40.950 --> 02:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
that works very well for that patient
 
02:03:42.470 --> 02:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
but their designated atc
 
02:03:44.310 --> 02:03:44.320 align:start position:0%
may not have it so they could go to a
 
02:03:45.669 --> 02:03:45.679 align:start position:0%
different atc
 
02:03:48.069 --> 02:03:48.079 align:start position:0%
and purchase that particular strain if
 
02:03:49.669 --> 02:03:49.679 align:start position:0%
they wish to they can also change their
 
02:03:50.950 --> 02:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
atc but they may
 
02:03:52.390 --> 02:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
have a couple of different strains from
 
02:03:54.069 --> 02:03:54.079 align:start position:0%
different places that they would like to
 
02:03:55.109 --> 02:03:55.119 align:start position:0%
be able to get
 
02:03:56.790 --> 02:03:56.800 align:start position:0%
first they're rather geographically
 
02:03:58.390 --> 02:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
separated so it's not
 
02:03:59.910 --> 02:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
real likely that people are going to run
 
02:04:01.430 --> 02:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
all over the state
 
02:04:03.510 --> 02:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
to be able to buy but it would just be
 
02:04:05.270 --> 02:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
for that explicit reason
 
02:04:06.790 --> 02:04:06.800 align:start position:0%
the second reason is to introduce a
 
02:04:08.790 --> 02:04:08.800 align:start position:0%
little bit of competition here
 
02:04:10.470 --> 02:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
a little bit of free market competition
 
02:04:12.470 --> 02:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
because the therapeutic cannabis prices
 
02:04:13.350 --> 02:04:13.360 align:start position:0%
are high
 
02:04:14.870 --> 02:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
if you have some good competition
 
02:04:16.950 --> 02:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
between different atc's
 
02:04:19.350 --> 02:04:19.360 align:start position:0%
that may drive some traffic to one atc
 
02:04:21.030 --> 02:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
preferably over the other
 
02:04:22.790 --> 02:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
that was the reason to lift the caps was
 
02:04:24.149 --> 02:04:24.159 align:start position:0%
to give the flexibility
 
02:04:28.629 --> 02:04:28.639 align:start position:0%
so that if one atc becomes predominant
 
02:04:31.830 --> 02:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
or begins to dominate a certain area
 
02:04:34.069 --> 02:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
that they can grow more that they need
 
02:04:35.750 --> 02:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
but it's really important to realize
 
02:04:38.709 --> 02:04:38.719 align:start position:0%
that the atc atc's as far as a cap let's
 
02:04:40.950 --> 02:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
just address that part part first
 
02:04:42.310 --> 02:04:42.320 align:start position:0%
they're currently are not growing
 
02:04:44.310 --> 02:04:44.320 align:start position:0%
anywhere near their maximum that they
 
02:04:45.510 --> 02:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
can grow their
 
02:04:48.229 --> 02:04:48.239 align:start position:0%
their plant counts are about six to 13
 
02:04:49.750 --> 02:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
percent of what they're currently
 
02:04:51.270 --> 02:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
allotted anyway
 
02:04:52.390 --> 02:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that is they're
 
02:04:54.390 --> 02:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
pretty well maxed out on their space
 
02:04:56.790 --> 02:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
but there is no market for what they
 
02:04:57.750 --> 02:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
grow except
 
02:05:00.790 --> 02:05:00.800 align:start position:0%
their atc customers
 
02:05:02.870 --> 02:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
they cannot sell it if they did they
 
02:05:04.229 --> 02:05:04.239 align:start position:0%
would lose their license that means they
 
02:05:05.589 --> 02:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
lose their business
 
02:05:07.750 --> 02:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
it also happens to be a felony minor
 
02:05:08.870 --> 02:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
couple of things there
 
02:05:11.030 --> 02:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
so there is no market for any excess
 
02:05:13.669 --> 02:05:13.679 align:start position:0%
cannabis and that has an expiration time
 
02:05:15.109 --> 02:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
therefore it would just have to simply
 
02:05:17.350 --> 02:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
be destroyed if they produce too much
 
02:05:19.030 --> 02:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
that's not particularly good business
 
02:05:20.709 --> 02:05:20.719 align:start position:0%
they can't export it anywhere they can't
 
02:05:21.750 --> 02:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
sell it anywhere
 
02:05:24.870 --> 02:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
only in their atc so the goal is to give
 
02:05:24.880 --> 02:05:25.189 align:start position:0%
only in their atc so the goal is to give
this

02:05:25.189 --> 02:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:05:28.709 --> 02:05:28.719 align:start position:0%
little bit of flexibility in terms of
 
02:05:31.109 --> 02:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
shifting of the market because we don't
 
02:05:32.149 --> 02:05:32.159 align:start position:0%
want to
 
02:05:34.870 --> 02:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
allow take off take off the designated
 
02:05:34.880 --> 02:05:35.750 align:start position:0%
allow take off take off the designated
atc

02:05:35.750 --> 02:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
atc
 
02:05:37.430 --> 02:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
then suddenly have an atc that can't
 
02:05:39.430 --> 02:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
produce enough because they become
 
02:05:40.709 --> 02:05:40.719 align:start position:0%
if they're in the more southern part of
 
02:05:42.390 --> 02:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
the state and people can can go to a
 
02:05:43.189 --> 02:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
different place
 
02:05:45.189 --> 02:05:45.199 align:start position:0%
suddenly they become much more popular
 
02:05:46.550 --> 02:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
and they're getting a lot more business
 
02:05:47.830 --> 02:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
and they can't grow what they need then
 
02:05:48.709 --> 02:05:48.719 align:start position:0%
we have to come
 
02:05:50.709 --> 02:05:50.719 align:start position:0%
back to the legislature so this was to
 
02:05:53.510 --> 02:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
preempt that potential problem
 
02:05:54.950 --> 02:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
that other focus is always on that
 
02:05:57.669 --> 02:05:57.679 align:start position:0%
appearance or that problem that is
 
02:06:00.790 --> 02:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
really not a real problem of people
 
02:06:03.109 --> 02:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
buying cannabis at multiple atc's and
 
02:06:03.119 --> 02:06:03.830 align:start position:0%
buying cannabis at multiple atc's and
then

02:06:03.830 --> 02:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:06:05.510 --> 02:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
reselling it if they don't have a
 
02:06:06.950 --> 02:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
designated they can go anywhere and be
 
02:06:08.149 --> 02:06:08.159 align:start position:0%
tracked first of all
 
02:06:10.870 --> 02:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
we do not track other medications except
 
02:06:10.880 --> 02:06:11.830 align:start position:0%
we do not track other medications except
opioids

02:06:11.830 --> 02:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
opioids
 
02:06:13.750 --> 02:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
and we do track pseudoephedrine because
 
02:06:15.350 --> 02:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
it's a building block for
 
02:06:15.360 --> 02:06:16.629 align:start position:0%
it's a building block for
methamphetamine

02:06:16.629 --> 02:06:16.639 align:start position:0%
methamphetamine
 
02:06:18.790 --> 02:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
otherwise your prescriptions are not
 
02:06:21.350 --> 02:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
tracked they are by the company
 
02:06:24.390 --> 02:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
but they're not tracked by the state so
 
02:06:27.589 --> 02:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
the he the key is that if people want to
 
02:06:28.830 --> 02:06:28.840 align:start position:0%
run around and buy
 
02:06:31.430 --> 02:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
stuff they are it's a real problem
 
02:06:33.189 --> 02:06:33.199 align:start position:0%
because it's illegal already for them to
 
02:06:34.629 --> 02:06:34.639 align:start position:0%
purchase more than a certain amount in a
 
02:06:36.149 --> 02:06:36.159 align:start position:0%
given time frame
 
02:06:38.470 --> 02:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
to possess more than a certain amount or
 
02:06:40.470 --> 02:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
to divert cannabis to any other
 
02:06:42.790 --> 02:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
person violation of that leads to loss
 
02:06:43.589 --> 02:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
of their card
 
02:06:46.629 --> 02:06:46.639 align:start position:0%
and criminal penalties their felonies
 
02:06:48.629 --> 02:06:48.639 align:start position:0%
second it doesn't make really good
 
02:06:50.390 --> 02:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
business sense to buy therapeutic
 
02:06:52.470 --> 02:06:52.480 align:start position:0%
cannabis and sell it in the black market
 
02:06:54.790 --> 02:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
because their atc cannabis is much more
 
02:06:57.430 --> 02:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
expensive than black market cannabis is
 
02:06:59.189 --> 02:06:59.199 align:start position:0%
as a result you'd be buying expensive
 
02:07:01.270 --> 02:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
cannabis to sell it at a loss i don't
 
02:07:02.550 --> 02:07:02.560 align:start position:0%
think very many people are going to want
 
02:07:03.750 --> 02:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
02:07:07.030 --> 02:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
and lastly as far as tracking currently
 
02:07:08.629 --> 02:07:08.639 align:start position:0%
in this state any person who has a new
 
02:07:11.030 --> 02:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire card can go across the border
 
02:07:11.669 --> 02:07:11.679 align:start position:0%
to maine
 
02:07:14.149 --> 02:07:14.159 align:start position:0%
massachusetts vermont and canada and buy
 
02:07:17.030 --> 02:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
cannabis legally
 
02:07:18.790 --> 02:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
they're they're still violating the law
 
02:07:20.550 --> 02:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of possessing too much and so
 
02:07:20.560 --> 02:07:21.109 align:start position:0%
in terms of possessing too much and so
on

02:07:21.109 --> 02:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:07:22.790 --> 02:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
they also break another law by crossing
 
02:07:25.109 --> 02:07:25.119 align:start position:0%
a border either state or international
 
02:07:27.830 --> 02:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
with cannabis but these people it's not
 
02:07:29.270 --> 02:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
tracked if somebody really wanted to
 
02:07:30.470 --> 02:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
circumvent this
 
02:07:32.069 --> 02:07:32.079 align:start position:0%
they can do it now by just going to a
 
02:07:34.149 --> 02:07:34.159 align:start position:0%
neighboring state and purchasing
 
02:07:38.950 --> 02:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
legal recreational cannabis um
 
02:07:41.189 --> 02:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
i think i'll let dennis acton go back
 
02:07:43.270 --> 02:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
and give his little comment but
 
02:07:45.030 --> 02:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
you got to realize most of these people
 
02:07:47.109 --> 02:07:47.119 align:start position:0%
the the major major age of the people on
 
02:07:48.709 --> 02:07:48.719 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program
 
02:07:51.830 --> 02:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
are 50 and 60 the most common indication
 
02:07:51.840 --> 02:07:52.229 align:start position:0%
are 50 and 60 the most common indication
being

02:07:52.229 --> 02:07:52.239 align:start position:0%
being
 
02:07:54.870 --> 02:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
pain you know it's this is not reefer
 
02:07:54.880 --> 02:07:55.669 align:start position:0%
pain you know it's this is not reefer
madness

02:07:55.669 --> 02:07:55.679 align:start position:0%
madness
 
02:07:57.350 --> 02:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
these are people using therapeutic
 
02:08:00.470 --> 02:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
cannabis reliably and responsibly
 
02:08:02.790 --> 02:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
and we're just simply trying to improve
 
02:08:03.990 --> 02:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
the patient
 
02:08:07.109 --> 02:08:07.119 align:start position:0%
uh experience to be able to go have some
 
02:08:09.189 --> 02:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
competition as far as which atc they go
 
02:08:09.199 --> 02:08:09.750 align:start position:0%
competition as far as which atc they go
to

02:08:09.750 --> 02:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:08:11.990 --> 02:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
both for the brand that the the variety
 
02:08:12.870 --> 02:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
they want
 
02:08:14.790 --> 02:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
and preferably maybe drive the price
 
02:08:14.800 --> 02:08:15.910 align:start position:0%
and preferably maybe drive the price
down

02:08:15.910 --> 02:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
down
 
02:08:18.229 --> 02:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
so that's i this this amendment is
 
02:08:19.589 --> 02:08:19.599 align:start position:0%
really i think
 
02:08:23.030 --> 02:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
not needed uh and would
 
02:08:24.310 --> 02:08:24.320 align:start position:0%
hurt some of the reforms you're trying
 
02:08:27.270 --> 02:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
to put into the program thank you
 
02:08:33.990 --> 02:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:36.069 --> 02:08:36.079 align:start position:0%
representative acton shapiro
 
02:08:39.189 --> 02:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
representative acton
 
02:08:42.870 --> 02:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair so i made my point
 
02:08:43.510 --> 02:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
last time
 
02:08:45.189 --> 02:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
that was embarrassing sorry i got a
 
02:08:46.470 --> 02:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
little ahead of myself here but you guys
 
02:08:48.310 --> 02:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
know what i was trying to get at
 
02:08:51.669 --> 02:08:51.679 align:start position:0%
uh originally the the amendments were
 
02:08:53.189 --> 02:08:53.199 align:start position:0%
starting to pile up into the into one
 
02:08:54.790 --> 02:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
amendment i i
 
02:08:56.870 --> 02:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
voiced my concern over that issue uh
 
02:08:58.069 --> 02:08:58.079 align:start position:0%
that we should deal with these things
 
02:09:00.229 --> 02:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
separately and that and that was done so
 
02:09:04.470 --> 02:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
um and and uh representative conrad made
 
02:09:05.990 --> 02:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
made the point that that i was going to
 
02:09:07.990 --> 02:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
make as well so um
 
02:09:10.390 --> 02:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
i just you know after the the final
 
02:09:12.550 --> 02:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
testimony that came in in the hearing
 
02:09:14.550 --> 02:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
from the police chief uh really that
 
02:09:16.870 --> 02:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
hurt that was painful
 
02:09:19.990 --> 02:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
to yet again have patients
 
02:09:21.430 --> 02:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
being treated like criminals just to
 
02:09:23.910 --> 02:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
boil it down to a to something we made
 
02:09:25.830 --> 02:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
you know i've been i've been a patient
 
02:09:27.589 --> 02:09:27.599 align:start position:0%
advocate for this for 14
 
02:09:31.510 --> 02:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
years now and we still are
 
02:09:34.790 --> 02:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
considered and you know 350 got killed
 
02:09:36.470 --> 02:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
it's it's just one thing after another
 
02:09:38.790 --> 02:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
and i really wish people would stop
 
02:09:42.470 --> 02:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
trying to um make it like we're all just
 
02:09:43.270 --> 02:09:43.280 align:start position:0%
waiting to
 
02:09:45.030 --> 02:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
break the law if given even the
 
02:09:45.040 --> 02:09:46.310 align:start position:0%
break the law if given even the
slightest

02:09:46.310 --> 02:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
slightest
 
02:09:48.629 --> 02:09:48.639 align:start position:0%
chance so um thank you thank you though

second uh amendment okay this amendment
 
02:12:54.229 --> 02:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
is a compromise amendment i worked out
 
02:12:55.830 --> 02:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
with michael holtz
 
02:12:58.629 --> 02:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
over the weekend uh michael holt i'm
 
02:13:00.629 --> 02:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
sorry michael holt is the person who
 
02:13:01.510 --> 02:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
runs the
 
02:13:04.390 --> 02:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
medical cannabis program for the state
 
02:13:04.400 --> 02:13:05.750 align:start position:0%
medical cannabis program for the state
okay

02:13:05.750 --> 02:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:13:08.310 --> 02:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
um we went back and forth with many of
 
02:13:10.229 --> 02:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
the same arguments that
 
02:13:12.149 --> 02:13:12.159 align:start position:0%
we just shared regarding the last
 
02:13:12.159 --> 02:13:13.669 align:start position:0%
we just shared regarding the last
amendment

02:13:13.669 --> 02:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:13:16.069 --> 02:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
i had just promised quite a few people i
 
02:13:17.750 --> 02:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
would bring that amendment forward
 
02:13:21.109 --> 02:13:21.119 align:start position:0%
so i did this one is a
 
02:13:24.390 --> 02:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
much larger compromise on my part
 
02:13:26.709 --> 02:13:26.719 align:start position:0%
and on the part of some other people
 
02:13:29.270 --> 02:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
what this does is it does not remove the
 
02:13:29.280 --> 02:13:30.550 align:start position:0%
what this does is it does not remove the
designation

02:13:30.550 --> 02:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
designation
 
02:13:35.270 --> 02:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
so people can go to any one of those
 
02:13:40.149 --> 02:13:40.159 align:start position:0%
sites and i will be working
 
02:13:43.350 --> 02:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
probably looking at to find some way to
 
02:13:44.310 --> 02:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
track that
 
02:13:47.350 --> 02:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
like we do opioids but that's not part
 
02:13:49.350 --> 02:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
of this amendment but that's my goal
 
02:13:52.310 --> 02:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
coming out of this so patients will
 
02:13:54.950 --> 02:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
still be able to go to any one of those
 
02:13:54.960 --> 02:13:56.310 align:start position:0%
still be able to go to any one of those
sites

02:13:56.310 --> 02:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
sites
 
02:13:58.470 --> 02:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
we also talked about the fact that we
 
02:13:59.669 --> 02:13:59.679 align:start position:0%
did we really need
 
02:14:02.390 --> 02:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
an increase in the amount of cannabis
 
02:14:03.750 --> 02:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
that was being grown
 
02:14:03.760 --> 02:14:05.109 align:start position:0%
that was being grown
[Music]

02:14:05.109 --> 02:14:05.119 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:14:08.470 --> 02:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
now um what we did is we reached
 
02:14:11.750 --> 02:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
a compromise so instead of using the
 
02:14:11.760 --> 02:14:12.550 align:start position:0%
a compromise so instead of using the
full

02:14:12.550 --> 02:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
full
 
02:14:15.910 --> 02:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
figure of the number of can of
 
02:14:19.030 --> 02:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
qualifying patients now which is
 
02:14:22.149 --> 02:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
a 11 000 plus a few
 
02:14:26.950 --> 02:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh we are limiting it to 25
 
02:14:30.310 --> 02:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
of the total number of qualifying
 
02:14:30.320 --> 02:14:31.350 align:start position:0%
of the total number of qualifying
patients

02:14:31.350 --> 02:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
patients
 
02:14:34.950 --> 02:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
so it brings so any one of those sites
 
02:14:38.870 --> 02:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:42.109 --> 02:14:42.119 align:start position:0%
so but we're talking about the
 
02:14:44.390 --> 02:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
multiplying figure
 
02:14:47.350 --> 02:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
that goes that is used against number of
 
02:14:49.750 --> 02:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
seeds the number of plants the amount of
 
02:14:49.760 --> 02:14:50.790 align:start position:0%
seeds the number of plants the amount of
product

02:14:50.790 --> 02:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
product
 
02:14:53.990 --> 02:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
so instead of using the whole 11 000
 
02:14:57.030 --> 02:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
total they only get to use 25
 
02:15:00.069 --> 02:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
of that what that does is it helps cover
 
02:15:03.350 --> 02:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
the atc's who have a larger
 
02:15:06.069 --> 02:15:06.079 align:start position:0%
clientele pool because they're in the
 
02:15:06.079 --> 02:15:07.270 align:start position:0%
clientele pool because they're in the
cities

02:15:07.270 --> 02:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
cities
 
02:15:11.109 --> 02:15:11.119 align:start position:0%
um that and that helped cover the fact
 
02:15:13.109 --> 02:15:13.119 align:start position:0%
that they are going to need more
 
02:15:16.870 --> 02:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
than necessarily uh the atc's in the
 
02:15:19.109 --> 02:15:19.119 align:start position:0%
other part of the state that may not
 
02:15:26.069 --> 02:15:26.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:28.790 --> 02:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
any further discussion or questions of
 
02:15:28.800 --> 02:15:29.430 align:start position:0%
any further discussion or questions of
the

02:15:29.430 --> 02:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:15:33.430 --> 02:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh amendment writer representative marsh

02:16:08.950 --> 02:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
consulted
 
02:16:12.149 --> 02:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
on amendment 1497h
 
02:16:14.790 --> 02:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
that is true we would like you to say
 
02:16:17.830 --> 02:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
whatever you wish to say to
 
02:16:20.229 --> 02:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
uh thank you i spoke with representative
 
02:16:21.589 --> 02:16:21.599 align:start position:0%
folsom last week
 
02:16:27.189 --> 02:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
about amendment um 1497.
 
02:16:30.229 --> 02:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
um the uh the compromise
 
02:16:32.870 --> 02:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
that she refers to is a compromise based
 
02:16:32.880 --> 02:16:33.429 align:start position:0%
that she refers to is a compromise based
on

02:16:33.429 --> 02:16:33.439 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:16:35.349 --> 02:16:35.359 align:start position:0%
you know this is where our conversation
 
02:16:37.030 --> 02:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
ended um
 
02:16:40.469 --> 02:16:40.479 align:start position:0%
a 25 cap on
 
02:16:43.669 --> 02:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
uh on on a plant count limit
 
02:16:46.870 --> 02:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
um i believe is unnecessary due to
 
02:16:49.110 --> 02:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
the testimony provided by representative
 
02:16:50.469 --> 02:16:50.479 align:start position:0%
knurk earlier
 
02:16:53.270 --> 02:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
in that none of the atc's are anywhere
 
02:16:54.469 --> 02:16:54.479 align:start position:0%
close to their current
 
02:16:57.750 --> 02:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
cap um however a 25
 
02:17:01.030 --> 02:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
cap does not pose a particular problem
 
02:17:04.469 --> 02:17:04.479 align:start position:0%
to the department or the atc's
 
02:17:07.750 --> 02:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
um like i said it's unnecessary but it
 
02:17:10.950 --> 02:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
it will not be it will not limit
 
02:17:12.709 --> 02:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
their ability to serve the patients of
 
02:17:13.990 --> 02:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire the
 
02:17:16.070 --> 02:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
only outlier concern that i would have
 
02:17:18.629 --> 02:17:18.639 align:start position:0%
is that if every patient decided to go
 
02:17:19.429 --> 02:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
to the same
 
02:17:22.870 --> 02:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
atc and not utilize the other one that
 
02:17:26.309 --> 02:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
single atc would not have
 
02:17:29.190 --> 02:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
the uh sufficient uh quantity of plants
 
02:17:30.790 --> 02:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
and cannabis to be used
 
02:17:32.790 --> 02:17:32.800 align:start position:0%
um however i do think that's an unlikely
 
02:17:34.549 --> 02:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
scenario uh currently there are
 
02:17:35.830 --> 02:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
approximately 12
 
02:17:39.830 --> 02:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
000 patients in the state four atc's
 
02:17:42.549 --> 02:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
with three operators there are only
 
02:17:43.669 --> 02:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
three cannabis
 
02:17:46.629 --> 02:17:46.639 align:start position:0%
operators in the state um this bill
 
02:17:46.639 --> 02:17:47.509 align:start position:0%
operators in the state um this bill
would

02:17:47.509 --> 02:17:47.519 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:17:49.990 --> 02:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
split them up based on license 25 per
 
02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:51.190 align:start position:0%
split them up based on license 25 per
license

02:17:51.190 --> 02:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
license
 
02:17:54.870 --> 02:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
although there are only three operators
 
02:17:56.790 --> 02:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
so um it doesn't pose any particular
 
02:18:00.549 --> 02:18:00.559 align:start position:0%
harm but in my view it is unnecessary
 
02:18:03.429 --> 02:18:03.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr holt would you please stay
 
02:18:04.790 --> 02:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
in the meeting in case there are
 
02:18:04.800 --> 02:18:05.990 align:start position:0%
in the meeting in case there are
questions

02:18:05.990 --> 02:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:18:09.349 --> 02:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
yourself representative um marsh
 
02:18:11.429 --> 02:18:11.439 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr holt and thank you for
 
02:18:13.030 --> 02:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:18:15.509 --> 02:18:15.519 align:start position:0%
uh you said that there are three growers
 
02:18:16.709 --> 02:18:16.719 align:start position:0%
in this state
 
02:18:18.629 --> 02:18:18.639 align:start position:0%
and we are tapping each of the three
 
02:18:20.709 --> 02:18:20.719 align:start position:0%
it's 25 percent of the qualifying
 
02:18:20.719 --> 02:18:21.509 align:start position:0%
it's 25 percent of the qualifying
patients

02:18:21.509 --> 02:18:21.519 align:start position:0%
patients
 
02:18:30.150 --> 02:18:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:33.190 --> 02:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
and that's not 100 so could you clarify
 
02:18:36.950 --> 02:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:40.790 --> 02:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
there are four atc licenses
 
02:18:45.750 --> 02:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
one operator has two of those licenses
 
02:18:48.469 --> 02:18:48.479 align:start position:0%
under the proposed amendment each
 
02:18:48.479 --> 02:18:49.190 align:start position:0%
under the proposed amendment each
license

02:18:49.190 --> 02:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
license
 
02:18:52.549 --> 02:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
would be capped at 25 which means
 
02:18:55.990 --> 02:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
that one of the atc's the one that holds
 
02:18:59.270 --> 02:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
two licenses would be capped at fifty
 
02:18:59.280 --> 02:19:02.230 align:start position:0%
two licenses would be capped at fifty
percent

02:19:02.230 --> 02:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:05.509 --> 02:19:05.519 align:start position:0%
that's how you get to a hundred percent
 
02:19:08.230 --> 02:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
follow up one one more follow-up and
 
02:19:09.349 --> 02:19:09.359 align:start position:0%
this will be one last
 
02:19:12.790 --> 02:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
one uh so if we're growing exactly 100
 
02:19:15.910 --> 02:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
of the qualified patients is there any
 
02:19:19.270 --> 02:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh adjustment allowed if one atc
 
02:19:21.110 --> 02:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
happens to have more patients than the
 
02:19:22.389 --> 02:19:22.399 align:start position:0%
others because
 
02:19:25.270 --> 02:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that if there's any uh
 
02:19:26.309 --> 02:19:26.319 align:start position:0%
inequality in the
 
02:19:28.549 --> 02:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
distribution of patients someone's gonna
 
02:19:30.629 --> 02:19:30.639 align:start position:0%
run out of hands
 
02:19:33.190 --> 02:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
under this bill there are no designated
 
02:19:33.200 --> 02:19:34.549 align:start position:0%
under this bill there are no designated
atc's

02:19:34.549 --> 02:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
atc's
 
02:19:37.349 --> 02:19:37.359 align:start position:0%
uh so there are no they're no longer any
 
02:19:38.870 --> 02:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
we don't know
 
02:19:42.629 --> 02:19:42.639 align:start position:0%
who is going to go where um
 
02:19:45.830 --> 02:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
currently uh there is a range of
 
02:19:47.830 --> 02:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
you know from about 1200 patients for
 
02:19:49.270 --> 02:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
the lowest atc
 
02:19:52.550 --> 02:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
to about 4500
 
02:19:54.550 --> 02:19:54.560 align:start position:0%
patients to the atc that has the most
 
02:19:54.560 --> 02:19:55.670 align:start position:0%
patients to the atc that has the most
patients

02:19:55.670 --> 02:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
patients
 
02:19:59.270 --> 02:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
um so so we don't we don't really know
 
02:20:00.630 --> 02:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
the answer to that i think it is
 
02:20:01.830 --> 02:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
possible but very
 
02:20:05.510 --> 02:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
unlikely that um the most popular atc
 
02:20:09.270 --> 02:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
the atc that uh does the best at uh
 
02:20:11.110 --> 02:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
um the friendly competition that
 
02:20:12.870 --> 02:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
representative canark was saying
 
02:20:14.710 --> 02:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
yeah it's possible that they would uh
 
02:20:17.030 --> 02:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
they would get closer to their maximums
 
02:20:20.309 --> 02:20:20.319 align:start position:0%
um the the data that i have shows that
 
02:20:22.630 --> 02:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
you know the the maximum is up to 70
 
02:20:24.469 --> 02:20:24.479 align:start position:0%
percent under a 25
 
02:20:27.510 --> 02:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
cap i can't imagine it um
 
02:20:30.389 --> 02:20:30.399 align:start position:0%
it going again i can't imagine there
 
02:20:31.830 --> 02:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
being a problem with the 20
 
02:20:34.150 --> 02:20:34.160 align:start position:0%
cap here because patients will continue
 
02:20:37.190 --> 02:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
to go to all the atc's in the state
 
02:20:40.070 --> 02:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you my questions denise anyone
 
02:20:40.080 --> 02:20:40.389 align:start position:0%
thank you my questions denise anyone
else

02:20:40.389 --> 02:20:40.399 align:start position:0%
else
 
02:20:42.790 --> 02:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
with the question for mr holt or comment
 
02:20:43.429 --> 02:20:43.439 align:start position:0%
about the
 
02:20:46.550 --> 02:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment i have a comment
 
02:20:48.790 --> 02:20:48.800 align:start position:0%
representative gay had her hand up
 
02:20:51.030 --> 02:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
emotionally before yours
 
02:20:54.150 --> 02:20:54.160 align:start position:0%
so representative this
 
02:20:57.270 --> 02:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
is an overall kind of view that my
 
02:21:00.230 --> 02:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
my concern is not with allowing more
 
02:21:01.830 --> 02:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
people to go
 
02:21:04.950 --> 02:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
so i'm not against this bill
 
02:21:08.309 --> 02:21:08.319 align:start position:0%
what my concern is that we are
 
02:21:11.270 --> 02:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
we're i think most of us our concern is
 
02:21:12.710 --> 02:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
for the patients
 
02:21:14.710 --> 02:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
that we want to make sure they have
 
02:21:15.990 --> 02:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
access to
 
02:21:19.270 --> 02:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
these uh to the right kind of cannabis
 
02:21:20.630 --> 02:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
for them
 
02:21:22.790 --> 02:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
my concern is that as more and more
 
02:21:25.030 --> 02:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
bills come
 
02:21:28.070 --> 02:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
it's that cannabis across the country
 
02:21:30.630 --> 02:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
is a big growing concern that's making
 
02:21:31.590 --> 02:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
some people
 
02:21:34.950 --> 02:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
very wealthy it's not just we know about
 
02:21:36.230 --> 02:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
big tobacco
 
02:21:38.790 --> 02:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
we know about big pharma well this is a
 
02:21:38.800 --> 02:21:39.510 align:start position:0%
we know about big pharma well this is a
big

02:21:39.510 --> 02:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
big
 
02:21:42.630 --> 02:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
a big enterprise too and i would like us
 
02:21:43.670 --> 02:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
to have
 
02:21:47.670 --> 02:21:47.680 align:start position:0%
some more thought for future reference
 
02:21:51.110 --> 02:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
about not allowing it to take over
 
02:21:54.230 --> 02:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
as tobacco and pharmaceuticals did
 
02:21:57.110 --> 02:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
i'd rather put the skids on now instead
 
02:21:59.030 --> 02:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
of oh my gosh we have a problem
 
02:22:02.150 --> 02:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
what do we do now so that that is so
 
02:22:04.790 --> 02:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
that is my concern it's not this bill
 
02:22:04.800 --> 02:22:05.190 align:start position:0%
that is my concern it's not this bill
it's

02:22:05.190 --> 02:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:22:08.630 --> 02:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
as this bill expands in the future
 
02:22:12.070 --> 02:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
02:22:14.469 --> 02:22:14.479 align:start position:0%
thank you just one thing to i did
 
02:22:15.830 --> 02:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
something to say but i wanted to go back
 
02:22:16.309 --> 02:22:16.319 align:start position:0%
to what
 
02:22:19.190 --> 02:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
to clarify a bit what i what i think mr
 
02:22:20.870 --> 02:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
holt was saying earlier too
 
02:22:23.910 --> 02:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
that issue is that under the
 
02:22:27.110 --> 02:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
under the bill without this amendment
 
02:22:28.870 --> 02:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
there would be the flexibility to be
 
02:22:31.349 --> 02:22:31.359 align:start position:0%
able to allow one atc to produce
 
02:22:34.630 --> 02:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
more if they needed to because they had
 
02:22:36.230 --> 02:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
more patients
 
02:22:38.630 --> 02:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
with this amendment we have the 25
 
02:22:40.070 --> 02:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
percent cap
 
02:22:42.389 --> 02:22:42.399 align:start position:0%
currently they could probably increase a
 
02:22:43.670 --> 02:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
fair amount as
 
02:22:45.670 --> 02:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
mr holt points out you'd have to have
 
02:22:47.510 --> 02:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
one become extremely dominant before
 
02:22:48.550 --> 02:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
they would then
 
02:22:50.630 --> 02:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
run out but the important thing is
 
02:22:53.429 --> 02:22:53.439 align:start position:0%
currently there are designated centers
 
02:22:56.550 --> 02:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
if we take away the designated atc
 
02:22:58.389 --> 02:22:58.399 align:start position:0%
but we pass this amendment there is the
 
02:23:01.830 --> 02:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
chance of having one predominant atc who
 
02:23:03.110 --> 02:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
does a good job
 
02:23:04.790 --> 02:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
unable to produce their amount that they
 
02:23:07.030 --> 02:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
need without this amendment we don't
 
02:23:08.630 --> 02:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
have that which is why i think this
 
02:23:11.349 --> 02:23:11.359 align:start position:0%
is still an unnecessary amendment
 
02:23:11.359 --> 02:23:12.230 align:start position:0%
is still an unnecessary amendment
because

02:23:12.230 --> 02:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:23:14.469 --> 02:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
again i already said all my other
 
02:23:14.479 --> 02:23:15.270 align:start position:0%
again i already said all my other
comments

02:23:15.270 --> 02:23:15.280 align:start position:0%
comments
 
02:23:16.870 --> 02:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
they're not growing more than they can
 
02:23:19.270 --> 02:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
sell there's no market for it they have
 
02:23:20.790 --> 02:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
to just destroy it that's not good
 
02:23:20.800 --> 02:23:21.670 align:start position:0%
to just destroy it that's not good
business

02:23:21.670 --> 02:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
business
 
02:23:23.830 --> 02:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
so they're not going to do that but this
 
02:23:26.630 --> 02:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
gets us in statute the flexibility
 
02:23:29.590 --> 02:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
to be ready if things do change what i
 
02:23:31.270 --> 02:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to say earlier is
 
02:23:32.870 --> 02:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
somebody earlier made a comment about
 
02:23:35.670 --> 02:23:35.680 align:start position:0%
comparing cannabis to opioids
 
02:23:37.429 --> 02:23:37.439 align:start position:0%
it really is a very different thing in
 
02:23:39.830 --> 02:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
the last 20 years about 500 000 people
 
02:23:41.910 --> 02:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
have died of opioid overdose
 
02:23:43.270 --> 02:23:43.280 align:start position:0%
and you can probably count on your hands
 
02:23:44.790 --> 02:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
and toes the number of people that died
 
02:23:45.990 --> 02:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
of a true cannabis
 
02:23:48.230 --> 02:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
overdose and the reason for that is very
 
02:23:50.790 --> 02:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
clear there are no cannabinoid receptors
 
02:23:51.830 --> 02:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
in the portion of the brain that
 
02:23:53.590 --> 02:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
controls respiration
 
02:23:56.710 --> 02:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
but there are opioid receptors that's
 
02:23:58.550 --> 02:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
how you get killed
 
02:24:00.630 --> 02:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
yes there are problems potentially with
 
02:24:02.710 --> 02:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
driving under the influence as there is
 
02:24:02.720 --> 02:24:03.349 align:start position:0%
driving under the influence as there is
with

02:24:03.349 --> 02:24:03.359 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:24:06.070 --> 02:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
opioids with alcohol and with not enough
 
02:24:06.080 --> 02:24:06.950 align:start position:0%
opioids with alcohol and with not enough
sleep

02:24:06.950 --> 02:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
sleep
 
02:24:08.550 --> 02:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
but we also don't think that that
 
02:24:10.230 --> 02:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
there's no good evidence that's a major
 
02:24:10.240 --> 02:24:11.190 align:start position:0%
there's no good evidence that's a major
problem

02:24:11.190 --> 02:24:11.200 align:start position:0%
problem
 
02:24:14.469 --> 02:24:14.479 align:start position:0%
either so again to clarify this is
 
02:24:17.190 --> 02:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
not as deadly as cannabinoids it doesn't
 
02:24:18.630 --> 02:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
need that kind of
 
02:24:21.349 --> 02:24:21.359 align:start position:0%
solid tracking and if we want to have
 
02:24:23.190 --> 02:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
tracking we could probably
 
02:24:24.790 --> 02:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
still try to put that in but we would
 
02:24:26.950 --> 02:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
have to appropriate some money
 
02:24:30.230 --> 02:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
to the program to do that um i it's
 
02:24:31.830 --> 02:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
they're not awash in money to be able to
 
02:24:33.830 --> 02:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
put in a tracking system
 
02:24:35.349 --> 02:24:35.359 align:start position:0%
at this point in time that would be a
 
02:24:37.270 --> 02:24:37.280 align:start position:0%
bill for another day if we wish to
 
02:24:40.950 --> 02:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
so in essence i echo what mr holt said
 
02:24:42.950 --> 02:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
it's this we can live with this although
 
02:24:44.309 --> 02:24:44.319 align:start position:0%
there is a potential
 
02:24:46.550 --> 02:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
for one atc perhaps to get into trouble
 
02:24:48.150 --> 02:24:48.160 align:start position:0%
with not being able to produce enough
 
02:24:49.670 --> 02:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
and needing to come to legislature to
 
02:24:51.990 --> 02:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
change it but i think it's unnecessary
 
02:24:54.469 --> 02:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
02:24:54.479 --> 02:24:55.110 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
anyone

02:24:55.110 --> 02:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
02:24:58.469 --> 02:24:58.479 align:start position:0%
else representative woods
 
02:25:01.270 --> 02:25:01.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and um uh thank you
 
02:25:03.670 --> 02:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
mr holt uh for uh taking my question i
 
02:25:05.030 --> 02:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
have a couple
 
02:25:08.150 --> 02:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
um my understanding uh that
 
02:25:11.349 --> 02:25:11.359 align:start position:0%
uh if one etc uh license
 
02:25:14.469 --> 02:25:14.479 align:start position:0%
uh runs short of a product uh
 
02:25:17.910 --> 02:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
a different atc uh has an excess
 
02:25:21.510 --> 02:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh they're allowed to sell at whatever
 
02:25:24.550 --> 02:25:24.560 align:start position:0%
wholesale price uh they can sell to the
 
02:25:27.429 --> 02:25:27.439 align:start position:0%
other atc is that correct
 
02:25:28.309 --> 02:25:28.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:25:29.830 --> 02:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
representative woods that is correct
 
02:25:30.870 --> 02:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
current law does
 
02:25:32.950 --> 02:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
allow sale between the new hampshire
 
02:25:32.960 --> 02:25:34.469 align:start position:0%
allow sale between the new hampshire
atc's

02:25:34.469 --> 02:25:34.479 align:start position:0%
atc's
 
02:25:38.070 --> 02:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
good thank you you may or may not have
 
02:25:41.270 --> 02:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
the um uh amendment in front of you
 
02:25:44.469 --> 02:25:44.479 align:start position:0%
uh but on line seven uh item
 
02:25:47.510 --> 02:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh parentheses one uh and then line
 
02:25:50.550 --> 02:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
nine parentheses two seem to be at odds
 
02:25:53.990 --> 02:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
it says in the first line uh that um
 
02:25:57.190 --> 02:25:57.200 align:start position:0%
what can be grown um but
 
02:25:58.630 --> 02:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
they're very different and the
 
02:26:00.469 --> 02:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
quantities would be very different
 
02:26:03.670 --> 02:26:03.680 align:start position:0%
um i i need some help understanding
 
02:26:07.190 --> 02:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh the difference between the the two
 
02:26:10.070 --> 02:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative woods uh i
 
02:26:11.110 --> 02:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
don't disagree
 
02:26:14.710 --> 02:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
that uh this section of the existing law
 
02:26:15.270 --> 02:26:15.280 align:start position:0%
is not
 
02:26:18.469 --> 02:26:18.479 align:start position:0%
a model of clarity um this uh this
 
02:26:20.309 --> 02:26:20.319 align:start position:0%
provision has gotten um
 
02:26:23.429 --> 02:26:23.439 align:start position:0%
some uh attention or uh i believe it was
 
02:26:23.439 --> 02:26:23.750 align:start position:0%
some uh attention or uh i believe it was
a

02:26:23.750 --> 02:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:26:25.910 --> 02:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
the result of a compromise when the bill
 
02:26:27.190 --> 02:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
was drafted
 
02:26:30.710 --> 02:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
um and it has never been um completely
 
02:26:32.830 --> 02:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
or has never been addressed the lack of
 
02:26:32.840 --> 02:26:34.070 align:start position:0%
or has never been addressed the lack of
clarity

02:26:34.070 --> 02:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
clarity
 
02:26:37.349 --> 02:26:37.359 align:start position:0%
what the department i can i can explain
 
02:26:38.309 --> 02:26:38.319 align:start position:0%
what the department
 
02:26:41.349 --> 02:26:41.359 align:start position:0%
interprets number one to mean is that
 
02:26:43.429 --> 02:26:43.439 align:start position:0%
that is an excess amount so being the
 
02:26:44.790 --> 02:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
standard amount
 
02:26:47.910 --> 02:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
three plants 12 seedlings six ounces for
 
02:26:48.950 --> 02:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
each patient who's
 
02:26:51.910 --> 02:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
designated that particular atc in our
 
02:26:51.920 --> 02:26:52.630 align:start position:0%
designated that particular atc in our
rules

02:26:52.630 --> 02:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
rules
 
02:26:55.750 --> 02:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
we explain that paragraph one 80
 
02:26:58.870 --> 02:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
cannabis plants 160 seedlings and
 
02:27:02.230 --> 02:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
another 80 ounces is an extra amount
 
02:27:05.670 --> 02:27:05.680 align:start position:0%
to deal with failed crops uh sale
 
02:27:09.910 --> 02:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
to other atc's and for start-up costs
 
02:27:12.150 --> 02:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
so no and and because these two
 
02:27:14.150 --> 02:27:14.160 align:start position:0%
paragraphs are connected by an and
 
02:27:17.190 --> 02:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
they would be added so in addition to
 
02:27:20.950 --> 02:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
the per patient amount in two
 
02:27:24.550 --> 02:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
the atcs are also allowed to possess
 
02:27:27.590 --> 02:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
this number of extra plants that are
 
02:27:27.600 --> 02:27:28.469 align:start position:0%
this number of extra plants that are
unrelated

02:27:28.469 --> 02:27:28.479 align:start position:0%
unrelated
 
02:27:32.070 --> 02:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
to per patient
 
02:27:34.790 --> 02:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
so if i understand correctly the way the
 
02:27:35.910 --> 02:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
rest of the bill
 
02:27:39.349 --> 02:27:39.359 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry follow-up mr chair
 
02:27:41.349 --> 02:27:41.359 align:start position:0%
um so if my understanding is correct
 
02:27:43.190 --> 02:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
then would the
 
02:27:46.389 --> 02:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
term on line eight qualifying patient in
 
02:27:49.670 --> 02:27:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh uh parentheses one does that mean
 
02:27:52.790 --> 02:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
per atc or the way we've written the
 
02:27:54.550 --> 02:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
rest of it would that be
 
02:27:56.550 --> 02:27:56.560 align:start position:0%
qualifying patients registered under
 
02:27:59.110 --> 02:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
this chapter
 
02:28:02.150 --> 02:28:02.160 align:start position:0%
we have written our rules essentially
 
02:28:05.030 --> 02:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
um to disregard that clause or six
 
02:28:07.110 --> 02:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
ounces of usable cannabis per qualifying
 
02:28:07.120 --> 02:28:07.670 align:start position:0%
ounces of usable cannabis per qualifying
patient

02:28:07.670 --> 02:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
patient
 
02:28:09.750 --> 02:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
because it's redundant with the paragra
 
02:28:11.349 --> 02:28:11.359 align:start position:0%
the the provision in two
 
02:28:14.389 --> 02:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
so our rules establish the 80 plants
 
02:28:16.950 --> 02:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
160 seedlings and 80 ounces of usable
 
02:28:16.960 --> 02:28:17.910 align:start position:0%
160 seedlings and 80 ounces of usable
cannabis

02:28:17.910 --> 02:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
02:28:21.030 --> 02:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
full stop okay so basically
 
02:28:24.309 --> 02:28:24.319 align:start position:0%
we could strike lines seven and eight um
 
02:28:27.429 --> 02:28:27.439 align:start position:0%
and that would help clarify you could
 
02:28:27.439 --> 02:28:28.309 align:start position:0%
and that would help clarify you could
strike

02:28:28.309 --> 02:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
strike
 
02:28:30.630 --> 02:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
line seven and eight starting with the
 
02:28:32.550 --> 02:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
comma before the word
 
02:28:36.389 --> 02:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
or and that would remove the confusion
 
02:28:39.030 --> 02:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
and the current law
 
02:28:45.270 --> 02:28:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:49.030 --> 02:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
representative folsom um
 
02:28:51.349 --> 02:28:51.359 align:start position:0%
when you're looking at lines seven and
 
02:28:54.469 --> 02:28:54.479 align:start position:0%
eight and then followed with um
 
02:28:57.270 --> 02:28:57.280 align:start position:0%
the two in parentheses what is
 
02:28:57.280 --> 02:28:57.910 align:start position:0%
the two in parentheses what is
interesting

02:28:57.910 --> 02:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
02:29:01.270 --> 02:29:01.280 align:start position:0%
is the very last word on uh set on line
 
02:29:05.110 --> 02:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
eight is the word and so technically by
 
02:29:08.790 --> 02:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
law it's an and even though the rules
 
02:29:12.070 --> 02:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
have been written as just
 
02:29:15.429 --> 02:29:15.439 align:start position:0%
the portion under number two
 
02:29:19.590 --> 02:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
no and the fact yeah and so
 
02:29:25.030 --> 02:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:28.469 --> 02:29:28.479 align:start position:0%
one of the things that um with regards
 
02:29:28.479 --> 02:29:29.110 align:start position:0%
one of the things that um with regards
to

02:29:29.110 --> 02:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:29:32.790 --> 02:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
making sure that and att atc does not
 
02:29:36.469 --> 02:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
run out is one the ability to
 
02:29:39.990 --> 02:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh have a transaction between atcs
 
02:29:43.750 --> 02:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
and then also the fact that um
 
02:29:46.870 --> 02:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
most it has been explained to me um
 
02:29:49.030 --> 02:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
that most people will probably stay at
 
02:29:50.710 --> 02:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
their same atc
 
02:29:54.230 --> 02:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
so there won't be a huge shift in
 
02:29:57.270 --> 02:29:57.280 align:start position:0%
in what's going on and
 
02:30:01.270 --> 02:30:01.280 align:start position:0%
the 25 still gives them plenty of room
 
02:30:04.230 --> 02:30:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh but it just helps put like
 
02:30:06.469 --> 02:30:06.479 align:start position:0%
representative gay said puts the skids
 
02:30:07.349 --> 02:30:07.359 align:start position:0%
on a little bit
 
02:30:10.550 --> 02:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
just to kind of this this whole medical
 
02:30:12.790 --> 02:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
cannabis program
 
02:30:16.550 --> 02:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
was built or not built but promoted
 
02:30:19.590 --> 02:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
to be a program that was going to be
 
02:30:23.030 --> 02:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
tightly run and so
 
02:30:25.510 --> 02:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
when it was passed and so i i'd like to
 
02:30:30.710 --> 02:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:33.910 --> 02:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative mccann thank
 
02:30:36.389 --> 02:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman
 
02:30:40.550 --> 02:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
i've spent years as chairman of the
 
02:30:44.070 --> 02:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana commission one of the
 
02:30:44.080 --> 02:30:44.950 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana commission one of the
major

02:30:44.950 --> 02:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
major
 
02:30:48.950 --> 02:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
concerns has always been access
 
02:30:53.910 --> 02:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
to the marijuana
 
02:30:57.349 --> 02:30:57.359 align:start position:0%
there's always been conflict
 
02:31:00.230 --> 02:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
particularly chief of police has been
 
02:31:00.240 --> 02:31:01.590 align:start position:0%
particularly chief of police has been
voted

02:31:01.590 --> 02:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
voted
 
02:31:04.950 --> 02:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
as a standing position that is held for
 
02:31:06.230 --> 02:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
five years
 
02:31:09.830 --> 02:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
lost so that comes as
 
02:31:12.950 --> 02:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely no support
 
02:31:16.070 --> 02:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
my concern is anything that
 
02:31:20.309 --> 02:31:20.319 align:start position:0%
interferes with the individual's access
 
02:31:23.750 --> 02:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
to those individuals who are qualified
 
02:31:30.300 --> 02:31:30.310 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
02:31:36.550 --> 02:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
so i don't think that this
 
02:31:40.230 --> 02:31:40.240 align:start position:0%
amendment helps i think what it does is
 
02:31:43.150 --> 02:31:43.160 align:start position:0%
makes access
 
02:31:43.160 --> 02:31:46.309 align:start position:0%
makes access

02:31:49.429 --> 02:31:49.439 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
02:31:52.550 --> 02:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
is there another hand up on the screen
 
02:31:56.070 --> 02:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
uh yes shapiro representative shapiro
 
02:31:58.630 --> 02:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and um this
 
02:32:00.389 --> 02:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
question might have been answered in
 
02:32:00.399 --> 02:32:00.790 align:start position:0%
question might have been answered in
part

02:32:00.790 --> 02:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
part
 
02:32:03.510 --> 02:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
um with the response to representative
 
02:32:03.520 --> 02:32:04.070 align:start position:0%
um with the response to representative

02:32:04.070 --> 02:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
woods
 
02:32:07.190 --> 02:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
um question but um
 
02:32:09.429 --> 02:32:09.439 align:start position:0%
mr holt i understand from what you're
 
02:32:10.469 --> 02:32:10.479 align:start position:0%
saying that while
 
02:32:12.790 --> 02:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
you don't think this is necessary that
 
02:32:15.190 --> 02:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
it's very unlikely that atcs would run
 
02:32:16.389 --> 02:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
out of products
 
02:32:19.750 --> 02:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
but i'm wondering if this 25 limit
 
02:32:22.710 --> 02:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
would constrain the choice of products
 
02:32:23.349 --> 02:32:23.359 align:start position:0%
at any
 
02:32:27.270 --> 02:32:27.280 align:start position:0%
given atc if it would um limit or
 
02:32:30.790 --> 02:32:30.800 align:start position:0%
constrain the um strains that
 
02:32:33.270 --> 02:32:33.280 align:start position:0%
maybe become uh popular because they're
 
02:32:34.150 --> 02:32:34.160 align:start position:0%
more effective
 
02:32:36.830 --> 02:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
at any particular atc or is that not an
 
02:32:36.840 --> 02:32:39.429 align:start position:0%
at any particular atc or is that not an
issue

02:32:39.429 --> 02:32:39.439 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:32:40.309 --> 02:32:40.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:32:41.990 --> 02:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro i i honestly
 
02:32:42.710 --> 02:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
02:32:45.270 --> 02:32:45.280 align:start position:0%
um the the atcs have not had an
 
02:32:46.550 --> 02:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
02:32:50.790 --> 02:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
to weigh in on this this cap um i don't
 
02:32:52.469 --> 02:32:52.479 align:start position:0%
like i said at the beginning i don't
 
02:32:54.230 --> 02:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
think this is a huge problem
 
02:32:56.870 --> 02:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
um to pass this amendment um i think
 
02:32:58.150 --> 02:32:58.160 align:start position:0%
it's unnecessary
 
02:33:00.870 --> 02:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
i think the concerns are you know
 
02:33:02.309 --> 02:33:02.319 align:start position:0%
largely unfounded
 
02:33:06.150 --> 02:33:06.160 align:start position:0%
um but uh it may have downstream
 
02:33:09.429 --> 02:33:09.439 align:start position:0%
consequences that we're not aware of
 
02:33:12.150 --> 02:33:12.160 align:start position:0%
atc's are able to sell to one another so
 
02:33:13.990 --> 02:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
if one got in a real pinch
 
02:33:16.790 --> 02:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
then you know presumably a certain
 
02:33:17.910 --> 02:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
strain could be
 
02:33:20.710 --> 02:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
you know backfilled by another atc if
 
02:33:22.150 --> 02:33:22.160 align:start position:0%
that of second atc
 
02:33:24.550 --> 02:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
sold that strain or produced the same
 
02:33:24.560 --> 02:33:25.590 align:start position:0%
sold that strain or produced the same
products

02:33:25.590 --> 02:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
products
 
02:33:28.710 --> 02:33:28.720 align:start position:0%
um but at that point well the patient
 
02:33:30.630 --> 02:33:30.640 align:start position:0%
could go to the other atc
 
02:33:32.070 --> 02:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
you know i mean all their formulations
 
02:33:33.830 --> 02:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
are slightly different they all
 
02:33:36.230 --> 02:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
sell flour they all sell tincture they
 
02:33:37.910 --> 02:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
all sell vape cartridges
 
02:33:41.270 --> 02:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
but the variety um um
 
02:33:43.990 --> 02:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
different you know the the the strains
 
02:33:46.309 --> 02:33:46.319 align:start position:0%
they differentiate between the atcs
 
02:33:47.910 --> 02:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
i think the answer is we don't know i
 
02:33:49.670 --> 02:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer to that question
 
02:33:51.510 --> 02:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
um i think there's a possibility of
 
02:33:53.590 --> 02:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
downstream impacts that we can't quite
 
02:33:53.600 --> 02:33:54.389 align:start position:0%
downstream impacts that we can't quite
envision

02:33:54.389 --> 02:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
envision
 
02:33:57.270 --> 02:33:57.280 align:start position:0%
at this time but i'd rather this bill
 
02:33:59.590 --> 02:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
get passed
 
02:34:04.230 --> 02:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
thank you i think i see representative
 
02:34:04.240 --> 02:34:08.790 align:start position:0%
thank you i think i see representative
weber

02:34:08.790 --> 02:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:11.030 --> 02:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i would like to
 
02:34:12.389 --> 02:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
say that
 
02:34:15.590 --> 02:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh yes historically this bill has been
 
02:34:15.600 --> 02:34:15.990 align:start position:0%
uh yes historically this bill has been
very

02:34:15.990 --> 02:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
very
 
02:34:19.190 --> 02:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
tightly controlled and even
 
02:34:22.389 --> 02:34:22.399 align:start position:0%
with the loosening of controls that we
 
02:34:24.150 --> 02:34:24.160 align:start position:0%
see in this bill
 
02:34:26.150 --> 02:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
i think we still have a pretty good
 
02:34:28.230 --> 02:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
handle on
 
02:34:29.910 --> 02:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
what's going on and of course the
 
02:34:31.510 --> 02:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
difference is
 
02:34:34.550 --> 02:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
that now we have a track record and
 
02:34:37.990 --> 02:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
the issues that have come up have
 
02:34:41.110 --> 02:34:41.120 align:start position:0%
been on the part of patients
 
02:34:43.110 --> 02:34:43.120 align:start position:0%
not being able to get what they need
 
02:34:44.790 --> 02:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
they've been issues of access they've
 
02:34:47.030 --> 02:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
been issues of price
 
02:34:50.870 --> 02:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
they've been issues of being able to get
 
02:34:53.990 --> 02:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
the right product that you need for your
 
02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:55.349 align:start position:0%
the right product that you need for your
condition

02:34:55.349 --> 02:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
condition
 
02:34:59.750 --> 02:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
and i think that this bill as it was
 
02:35:01.830 --> 02:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
originally drafted helps with all of
 
02:35:03.830 --> 02:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
those i'm particularly
 
02:35:05.990 --> 02:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh pleased with the aspect of
 
02:35:07.429 --> 02:35:07.439 align:start position:0%
competition that
 
02:35:09.349 --> 02:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
might actually drive some pretty
 
02:35:12.230 --> 02:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
expensive prices down a little bit
 
02:35:15.670 --> 02:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
and finally i just want a second
 
02:35:18.309 --> 02:35:18.319 align:start position:0%
two of the points that representative
 
02:35:19.349 --> 02:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
acton made
 
02:35:24.070 --> 02:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
earlier one being that
 
02:35:26.630 --> 02:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
we are talking patients here and
 
02:35:29.030 --> 02:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
patients should not be
 
02:35:32.389 --> 02:35:32.399 align:start position:0%
uh subject to the kinds of
 
02:35:35.190 --> 02:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
hoops to get something that will treat
 
02:35:35.200 --> 02:35:35.750 align:start position:0%
hoops to get something that will treat
them

02:35:35.750 --> 02:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:35:39.910 --> 02:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
and and and so i'm for removal of hoops
 
02:35:41.349 --> 02:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
for patients rather than
 
02:35:44.870 --> 02:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
increasing or or having the possibility
 
02:35:46.550 --> 02:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
of increasing hoops for patient
 
02:35:49.590 --> 02:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
on the one hand and on the second thing
 
02:35:50.150 --> 02:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
and just
 
02:35:52.710 --> 02:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
this is just globally not this amendment
 
02:35:53.670 --> 02:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
i also
 
02:35:55.910 --> 02:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
second what representative acton said
 
02:35:58.630 --> 02:35:58.640 align:start position:0%
about not being a fan of omnibus bills
 
02:36:01.670 --> 02:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
and being very appreciative of having
 
02:36:04.550 --> 02:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
the amendments be offered one by one so
 
02:36:06.469 --> 02:36:06.479 align:start position:0%
we can vote on them individually
 
02:36:08.550 --> 02:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
so i thank people for that thank you
 
02:36:10.550 --> 02:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
very much mr chair and members
 
02:36:13.590 --> 02:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
02:36:13.600 --> 02:36:14.630 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
folsom

02:36:14.630 --> 02:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
folsom
 
02:36:17.510 --> 02:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
okay i'll just thank you so much to the
 
02:36:18.469 --> 02:36:18.479 align:start position:0%
rest of the committee
 
02:36:20.790 --> 02:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
for allowing this freshman legislator to
 
02:36:23.510 --> 02:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
come out here on such a simple issue
 
02:36:26.550 --> 02:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
um and get her feet wet
 
02:36:30.550 --> 02:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
um and i just have a couple little
 
02:36:30.560 --> 02:36:31.349 align:start position:0%
um and i just have a couple little
comments

02:36:31.349 --> 02:36:31.359 align:start position:0%
comments
 
02:36:33.110 --> 02:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
um just to respond to some other
 
02:36:34.790 --> 02:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
people's comments
 
02:36:38.309 --> 02:36:38.319 align:start position:0%
and that is one if we're worried about
 
02:36:41.510 --> 02:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh atcs not having particular strange
 
02:36:44.309 --> 02:36:44.319 align:start position:0%
strains because they become more popular
 
02:36:44.319 --> 02:36:44.710 align:start position:0%
strains because they become more popular
um

02:36:44.710 --> 02:36:44.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:47.190 --> 02:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
it's a good business model that if uh
 
02:36:49.030 --> 02:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
you have a string that's becoming more
 
02:36:49.990 --> 02:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
popular you're
 
02:36:52.630 --> 02:36:52.640 align:start position:0%
gonna start carrying more of that
 
02:36:52.640 --> 02:36:54.389 align:start position:0%
gonna start carrying more of that
product

02:36:54.389 --> 02:36:54.399 align:start position:0%
product
 
02:36:58.070 --> 02:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
and the competition issue
 
02:37:00.790 --> 02:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
i'm having some problem with because of
 
02:37:01.990 --> 02:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
the fact
 
02:37:06.230 --> 02:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
that you have the same group owning
 
02:37:09.190 --> 02:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
a multiple well license for multiple
 
02:37:09.200 --> 02:37:09.990 align:start position:0%
a multiple well license for multiple
sites

02:37:09.990 --> 02:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
sites
 
02:37:13.590 --> 02:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
so if one company owns or we're limiting
 
02:37:15.590 --> 02:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
the number of companies
 
02:37:18.950 --> 02:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
that own these uh atc's
 
02:37:21.510 --> 02:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot of incentive to drop
 
02:37:22.950 --> 02:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
their prices
 
02:37:26.230 --> 02:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
but and thank you very much for
 
02:37:28.309 --> 02:37:28.319 align:start position:0%
for helping me walk through this
 
02:37:29.910 --> 02:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
amendment and
 
02:37:32.630 --> 02:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
um it's been an incredible learning
 
02:37:32.640 --> 02:37:35.910 align:start position:0%
um it's been an incredible learning
experience

02:37:35.910 --> 02:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:35.920 --> 02:37:40.389 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:37:40.389 --> 02:37:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:43.590 --> 02:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm you i i just muted myself yeah
 
02:37:45.270 --> 02:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to ask
 
02:37:48.070 --> 02:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
i think mike holt kind of gave us soto
 
02:37:48.080 --> 02:37:49.270 align:start position:0%
i think mike holt kind of gave us soto
voce

02:37:49.270 --> 02:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
voce
 
02:37:51.910 --> 02:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
no at one point about still that
 
02:37:53.349 --> 02:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
confusion of line seven
 
02:37:55.750 --> 02:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
eight and nine when representing folsom
 
02:37:57.349 --> 02:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
was earlier speaking
 
02:37:59.349 --> 02:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
and i was hoping he would address that
 
02:38:00.469 --> 02:38:00.479 align:start position:0%
could he
 
02:38:02.550 --> 02:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
i i think there was still some confusion
 
02:38:04.710 --> 02:38:04.720 align:start position:0%
about the fact that it was one set of
 
02:38:04.720 --> 02:38:05.429 align:start position:0%
about the fact that it was one set of
data

02:38:05.429 --> 02:38:05.439 align:start position:0%
data
 
02:38:07.590 --> 02:38:07.600 align:start position:0%
and that the rules still had allowed
 
02:38:08.710 --> 02:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
both one and two
 
02:38:11.030 --> 02:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
it just took out the six ounces of
 
02:38:12.469 --> 02:38:12.479 align:start position:0%
usable cannabis because that was
 
02:38:17.670 --> 02:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:21.270 --> 02:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative knurk yes um
 
02:38:24.790 --> 02:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
your uh your summary is correct
 
02:38:27.590 --> 02:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
um in our rules we have the same
 
02:38:29.670 --> 02:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
structure as in the statute
 
02:38:31.750 --> 02:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
in that it is an and there are two
 
02:38:31.760 --> 02:38:33.110 align:start position:0%
in that it is an and there are two
categories

02:38:33.110 --> 02:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
categories
 
02:38:35.590 --> 02:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
we establish the primary category as the
 
02:38:37.270 --> 02:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
per patient amount
 
02:38:40.469 --> 02:38:40.479 align:start position:0%
in um that's in paragraph two we go on
 
02:38:41.030 --> 02:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
to say
 
02:38:43.910 --> 02:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
and up to eight up to an additional 80
 
02:38:44.950 --> 02:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
mature plants
 
02:38:47.910 --> 02:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
160 seedlings and 80 ounces of usable
 
02:38:47.920 --> 02:38:48.710 align:start position:0%
160 seedlings and 80 ounces of usable
cannabis

02:38:48.710 --> 02:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
02:38:50.950 --> 02:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
including for start-up operations to
 
02:38:52.870 --> 02:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
assist with a failed batch of cannabis
 
02:38:55.429 --> 02:38:55.439 align:start position:0%
to allow sufficient quantity of cannabis
 
02:38:56.710 --> 02:38:56.720 align:start position:0%
for new patients
 
02:38:58.389 --> 02:38:58.399 align:start position:0%
or to fill requests for the sale of
 
02:39:00.230 --> 02:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
cannabis to other atc's
 
02:39:03.429 --> 02:39:03.439 align:start position:0%
in our rules we have not included the
 
02:39:05.030 --> 02:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
confusing language
 
02:39:16.550 --> 02:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:17.990 --> 02:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
yeah just a quick follow-up the other
 
02:39:19.830 --> 02:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
thing in terms of the strains and
 
02:39:21.429 --> 02:39:21.439 align:start position:0%
competition indeed
 
02:39:24.230 --> 02:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
i think we will see that we in statute
 
02:39:26.070 --> 02:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
this was set up with four atc's we
 
02:39:27.590 --> 02:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
expanded to some other areas because
 
02:39:29.349 --> 02:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
there were markedly underserved areas
 
02:39:29.359 --> 02:39:30.230 align:start position:0%
there were markedly underserved areas
particularly

02:39:30.230 --> 02:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
02:39:31.590 --> 02:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
the north country and down in the
 
02:39:34.309 --> 02:39:34.319 align:start position:0%
southwest and that's why some atc's have
 
02:39:35.030 --> 02:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
more than one
 
02:39:37.910 --> 02:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
actual sales front uh to be but we in
 
02:39:39.750 --> 02:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
statute it's only set at four
 
02:39:41.590 --> 02:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
and we'd have to change that and we have
 
02:39:42.790 --> 02:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
not done so
 
02:39:44.950 --> 02:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
as far as a strain it does take some
 
02:39:46.550 --> 02:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
time to start growing another strain
 
02:39:47.670 --> 02:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
it's a biological
 
02:39:50.309 --> 02:39:50.319 align:start position:0%
sorry it's a botanical product and if
 
02:39:51.910 --> 02:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
you say wow this is really going to be
 
02:39:51.920 --> 02:39:52.469 align:start position:0%
you say wow this is really going to be
good

02:39:52.469 --> 02:39:52.479 align:start position:0%
good
 
02:39:53.990 --> 02:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
you have to ramp up production and it's
 
02:39:55.510 --> 02:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
going to be a significant amount of time
 
02:39:56.309 --> 02:39:56.319 align:start position:0%
so it isn't
 
02:39:59.030 --> 02:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
a simple switch turn there's no supply
 
02:40:00.870 --> 02:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
chain going elsewhere
 
02:40:03.429 --> 02:40:03.439 align:start position:0%
but indeed it is expected that we would
 
02:40:03.439 --> 02:40:04.309 align:start position:0%
but indeed it is expected that we would
see

02:40:04.309 --> 02:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
see
 
02:40:07.349 --> 02:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
uh the atc's respond to the demand that
 
02:40:08.309 --> 02:40:08.319 align:start position:0%
would be the hope
 
02:40:12.230 --> 02:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:15.830 --> 02:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:20.550 --> 02:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
02:40:23.590 --> 02:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
one of my concerns that again
 
02:40:26.389 --> 02:40:26.399 align:start position:0%
is it's not exactly in this bill but one
 
02:40:28.550 --> 02:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
of my concerns is that we're speaking it
 
02:40:32.469 --> 02:40:32.479 align:start position:0%
as if people want it so we don't need
 
02:40:35.030 --> 02:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
any kind of controls
 
02:40:38.230 --> 02:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
the pharmaceutical industry from
 
02:40:39.830 --> 02:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
the personal point of view not the
 
02:40:43.110 --> 02:40:43.120 align:start position:0%
industry but me and that purchaser
 
02:40:46.830 --> 02:40:46.840 align:start position:0%
i have to i have to be bound by
 
02:40:50.870 --> 02:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
controls so i don't want to
 
02:40:54.150 --> 02:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
i don't want to go totally like
 
02:40:56.630 --> 02:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
we don't need controls because if we
 
02:40:58.389 --> 02:40:58.399 align:start position:0%
didn't need controls why do we have them
 
02:41:00.230 --> 02:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
on pharmaceuticals
 
02:41:03.190 --> 02:41:03.200 align:start position:0%
if i want a painkiller i can't just go
 
02:41:04.150 --> 02:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
to the nearby
 
02:41:06.550 --> 02:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
store and show my card and buy as much
 
02:41:07.750 --> 02:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
as i want
 
02:41:09.750 --> 02:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
are even the limit on what it wants you
 
02:41:10.950 --> 02:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
know it's supposed to be
 
02:41:14.230 --> 02:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
tailored to what i should have uh so i'm
 
02:41:16.950 --> 02:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
i am concerned about treating
 
02:41:19.269 --> 02:41:19.279 align:start position:0%
marijuana medical marijuana therapeutic
 
02:41:19.279 --> 02:41:20.550 align:start position:0%
marijuana medical marijuana therapeutic
marijuana

02:41:20.550 --> 02:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
marijuana
 
02:41:23.269 --> 02:41:23.279 align:start position:0%
which i do think is a good thing i'm
 
02:41:23.279 --> 02:41:23.670 align:start position:0%
which i do think is a good thing i'm
just

02:41:23.670 --> 02:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:41:26.630 --> 02:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
a little concerned about the laissez
 
02:41:29.110 --> 02:41:29.120 align:start position:0%
faire a field slasic fair
 
02:41:31.190 --> 02:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
about this as opposed to a
 
02:41:31.200 --> 02:41:33.110 align:start position:0%
about this as opposed to a
pharmaceutical

02:41:33.110 --> 02:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical
 
02:41:35.830 --> 02:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy if the federal government
 
02:41:37.750 --> 02:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
didn't keep acting like marijuana was
 
02:41:38.790 --> 02:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
totally illegal
 
02:41:41.910 --> 02:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
so that everybody has to be bound by
 
02:41:43.429 --> 02:41:43.439 align:start position:0%
their rules
 
02:41:45.750 --> 02:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
if it was treated as a pharmaceutical
 
02:41:45.760 --> 02:41:46.469 align:start position:0%
if it was treated as a pharmaceutical
and

02:41:46.469 --> 02:41:46.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:41:50.469 --> 02:41:50.479 align:start position:0%
the different mixes were in hill form
 
02:41:53.510 --> 02:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
and it was a controlled a controlled
 
02:41:54.710 --> 02:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
thing because you can say
 
02:41:56.550 --> 02:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
oh it's not a hard drug it doesn't
 
02:41:58.950 --> 02:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
affect the brain but we know for a fact
 
02:41:59.910 --> 02:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
that lots of people
 
02:42:02.710 --> 02:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
are addicted to it in addition to a
 
02:42:04.309 --> 02:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
zillion other things in new hampshire
 
02:42:05.190 --> 02:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
which is this
 
02:42:06.950 --> 02:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
severe problem that we temporarily
 
02:42:10.070 --> 02:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
forgot the dealing with codeine
 
02:42:11.830 --> 02:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
so i would really like people to get
 
02:42:14.070 --> 02:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
their mindset to combine
 
02:42:16.550 --> 02:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
the way you treat pharmaceuticals and
 
02:42:17.590 --> 02:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
the way you treat
 
02:42:21.030 --> 02:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic uh canvas
 
02:42:23.349 --> 02:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't be two separate ways to
 
02:42:23.359 --> 02:42:24.870 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't be two separate ways to
deal

02:42:24.870 --> 02:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
deal
 
02:42:26.870 --> 02:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
we really need to be put the same
 
02:42:26.880 --> 02:42:27.990 align:start position:0%
we really need to be put the same
controls

02:42:27.990 --> 02:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
controls
 
02:42:30.230 --> 02:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
on anything that's affecting the mind or
 
02:42:32.150 --> 02:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
the body
 
02:42:35.269 --> 02:42:35.279 align:start position:0%
look with the same care that we
 
02:42:38.389 --> 02:42:38.399 align:start position:0%
do to uh pharmaceuticals
 
02:42:41.830 --> 02:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
02:42:44.870 --> 02:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
um we do not have anything in statute
 
02:42:46.070 --> 02:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
that limits
 
02:42:49.030 --> 02:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
how much product uh pharmaceuticals can
 
02:42:50.309 --> 02:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
make i don't think that there's any
 
02:42:50.319 --> 02:42:51.190 align:start position:0%
make i don't think that there's any
limit

02:42:51.190 --> 02:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
limit
 
02:42:54.230 --> 02:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
on how many uh the senate pro pills the
 
02:42:54.240 --> 02:42:54.870 align:start position:0%
on how many uh the senate pro pills the
producer

02:42:54.870 --> 02:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
producer
 
02:42:57.830 --> 02:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
can make and we also don't limit uh
 
02:42:58.870 --> 02:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
where they can
 
02:43:01.750 --> 02:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
sell them this is extremely tightly
 
02:43:01.760 --> 02:43:02.469 align:start position:0%
sell them this is extremely tightly
regulated

02:43:02.469 --> 02:43:02.479 align:start position:0%
regulated
 
02:43:05.830 --> 02:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
in our state program and it is not
 
02:43:08.870 --> 02:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
a laissez-faire program so i if we're
 
02:43:09.910 --> 02:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
going to make comparison to
 
02:43:09.920 --> 02:43:10.870 align:start position:0%
going to make comparison to
pharmaceuticals

02:43:10.870 --> 02:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
pharmaceuticals
 
02:43:12.550 --> 02:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
we would throw out a lot of the
 
02:43:13.910 --> 02:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
restrictions we currently have in the
 
02:43:16.150 --> 02:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program
 
02:43:18.710 --> 02:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
also though the rate of actual addiction
 
02:43:19.830 --> 02:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
in cannabis
 
02:43:22.790 --> 02:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
is not everybody it's i i'm quite sure
 
02:43:25.030 --> 02:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
it's around 12 percent
 
02:43:26.790 --> 02:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
i think is the current number who
 
02:43:28.550 --> 02:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
actually do have cannabis use disorder
 
02:43:30.230 --> 02:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
but that's primarily
 
02:43:32.790 --> 02:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
in recreational patients do you
 
02:43:34.550 --> 02:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
understand again as i've said before in
 
02:43:36.070 --> 02:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis
 
02:43:38.389 --> 02:43:38.399 align:start position:0%
we start with a low dose we slowly
 
02:43:40.630 --> 02:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
titrate to get the therapeutic effect
 
02:43:42.870 --> 02:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
while avoiding the unwanted effects of
 
02:43:42.880 --> 02:43:44.070 align:start position:0%
while avoiding the unwanted effects of
euphoria

02:43:44.070 --> 02:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
euphoria
 
02:43:47.190 --> 02:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
and mental disruption because that is
 
02:43:50.550 --> 02:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
not the intended effect that is a side
 
02:43:50.560 --> 02:43:51.510 align:start position:0%
not the intended effect that is a side
effect

02:43:51.510 --> 02:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
effect
 
02:43:53.830 --> 02:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
and so we do not see with the cannabis
 
02:43:55.429 --> 02:43:55.439 align:start position:0%
use disorder rate in therapeutic
 
02:43:55.439 --> 02:43:56.230 align:start position:0%
use disorder rate in therapeutic
cannabis

02:43:56.230 --> 02:43:56.240 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
02:43:58.150 --> 02:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
is probably markedly smaller we do not
 
02:43:59.349 --> 02:43:59.359 align:start position:0%
have that data
 
02:44:00.950 --> 02:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
that is markedly different than the
 
02:44:07.590 --> 02:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:09.670 --> 02:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
i do not mean controlling the
 
02:44:11.670 --> 02:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical anymore
 
02:44:15.190 --> 02:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
i meant i am controlled by what i can
 
02:44:15.200 --> 02:44:15.670 align:start position:0%
i meant i am controlled by what i can
get

02:44:15.670 --> 02:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
get
 
02:44:18.389 --> 02:44:18.399 align:start position:0%
at the pharmacy so i wouldn't make a
 
02:44:18.399 --> 02:44:20.070 align:start position:0%
at the pharmacy so i wouldn't make a
comparison

02:44:20.070 --> 02:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
comparison
 
02:44:22.710 --> 02:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
i'm in control i can't just take a card
 
02:44:24.230 --> 02:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
it says i'm gonna try over this much and
 
02:44:25.110 --> 02:44:25.120 align:start position:0%
just go
 
02:44:28.630 --> 02:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
multiple places and get it the control
 
02:44:30.870 --> 02:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
is on the patient
 
02:44:33.910 --> 02:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
so i didn't mean to make a
 
02:44:37.190 --> 02:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
foolish comparison of the suppliers
 
02:44:40.309 --> 02:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
of pharmaceuticals and the suppliers of
 
02:44:43.269 --> 02:44:43.279 align:start position:0%
uh although that's how we try to control
 
02:44:44.469 --> 02:44:44.479 align:start position:0%
it in the state
 
02:44:47.670 --> 02:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
we try to control who dispenses
 
02:44:49.990 --> 02:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
and we definitely need to change the law
 
02:44:51.910 --> 02:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
so that we don't have
 
02:44:54.790 --> 02:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
four people controlling the whole you
 
02:44:54.800 --> 02:44:55.110 align:start position:0%
four people controlling the whole you
know

02:44:55.110 --> 02:44:55.120 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:44:58.830 --> 02:44:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:58.840 --> 02:44:59.990 align:start position:0%

02:44:59.990 --> 02:45:00.000 align:start position:0%

02:45:03.429 --> 02:45:03.439 align:start position:0%
like to get to a roll call on this if
 
02:45:06.230 --> 02:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
anyone has anything that we haven't
 
02:45:06.240 --> 02:45:07.590 align:start position:0%
anyone has anything that we haven't
heard

02:45:07.590 --> 02:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
heard

vote that there are incredible great
 
02:49:27.910 --> 02:49:27.920 align:start position:0%

through so
 
02:49:31.750 --> 02:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
even though the things that i don't like
 
02:49:34.389 --> 02:49:34.399 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman um so i
 
02:49:52.870 --> 02:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
going back to section 59 what
 
02:49:55.190 --> 02:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
part of statute because i have asked
 
02:49:58.070 --> 02:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
melissa saint ceo to clarify because
 
02:50:01.429 --> 02:50:01.439 align:start position:0%
um i was confused on
 
02:50:05.190 --> 02:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
why the um the fiscal note had
 
02:50:08.870 --> 02:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
you know zeros across for the impact of
 
02:50:09.750 --> 02:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
this section
 
02:50:11.349 --> 02:50:11.359 align:start position:0%
if it's saying that it's providing
 
02:50:13.110 --> 02:50:13.120 align:start position:0%
funding for but
 
02:50:16.309 --> 02:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
um st sear
 
02:50:19.910 --> 02:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh clarified that section 59
 
02:50:21.750 --> 02:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
only requires the department to work on
 
02:50:23.670 --> 02:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
a plan
 
02:50:26.550 --> 02:50:26.560 align:start position:0%
and i had played with changing the
 
02:50:28.150 --> 02:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
language to say
 
02:50:30.870 --> 02:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
you know shall provide a plan for
 
02:50:32.070 --> 02:50:32.080 align:start position:0%
develop a plan
 
02:50:35.190 --> 02:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
post action plan something um and i was
 
02:50:36.710 --> 02:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
waiting to hear back from her
 
02:50:39.990 --> 02:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
on what statue
 
02:50:43.269 --> 02:50:43.279 align:start position:0%
section 59 comments or changes
 
02:50:45.190 --> 02:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
or where in statute the language is
 
02:50:48.710 --> 02:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:16.830 --> 02:51:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:16.840 --> 02:51:19.030 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:51:19.030 --> 02:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:51:21.750 --> 02:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at the side by side that
 
02:51:23.670 --> 02:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
christina daya provided
 
02:51:26.950 --> 02:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
us with with the senate bill on the left
 
02:51:29.110 --> 02:51:29.120 align:start position:0%
side and note senate on the right
 
02:51:32.790 --> 02:51:32.800 align:start position:0%
and the notes read that
 
02:51:35.830 --> 02:51:35.840 align:start position:0%
this section 59 designates
 
02:51:39.190 --> 02:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
collaboration with dhs doa drc of new
 
02:51:39.200 --> 02:51:39.830 align:start position:0%
collaboration with dhs doa drc of new
hampshire

02:51:39.830 --> 02:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:51:43.670 --> 02:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
and the 10 area agencies
 
02:51:46.950 --> 02:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
that's all it says okay so but we don't
 
02:51:52.630 --> 02:51:52.640 align:start position:0%

john williams is on the call well thank
 
02:51:55.439 --> 02:51:55.830 align:start position:0%
john williams is on the call well thank
you

02:51:55.830 --> 02:51:55.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:51:59.190 --> 02:51:59.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh yes
 
02:52:11.030 --> 02:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:16.630 --> 02:52:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:18.710 --> 02:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
and i have to unmute so thank you very
 
02:52:20.070 --> 02:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
much um
 
02:52:21.830 --> 02:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
that will end up in what they call
 
02:52:23.510 --> 02:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
session law or chapter law it's not
 
02:52:24.950 --> 02:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
related to a specific
 
02:52:27.349 --> 02:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
rsa but it carries a full force as if it
 
02:52:29.590 --> 02:52:29.600 align:start position:0%
were in an rsa
 
02:52:31.510 --> 02:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
i got the knowing not an approval of
 
02:52:33.030 --> 02:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
representative weber so i have a
 
02:52:34.469 --> 02:52:34.479 align:start position:0%
double confirmation that that is
 
02:52:34.479 --> 02:52:36.389 align:start position:0%
double confirmation that that is
absolutely

02:52:36.389 --> 02:52:36.399 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
02:52:41.269 --> 02:52:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:45.830 --> 02:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:48.950 --> 02:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
just just as a further clarification
 
02:52:51.830 --> 02:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh session law doesn't get published in
 
02:52:53.030 --> 02:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
the books
 
02:52:55.990 --> 02:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
it usually gets used for a freestanding
 
02:52:57.349 --> 02:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
thing like this
 
02:53:01.110 --> 02:53:01.120 align:start position:0%
which is expected to be done in
 
02:53:04.230 --> 02:53:04.240 align:start position:0%
a certain amount of time which this is
 
02:53:07.990 --> 02:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
and as as mr williams said it it's
 
02:53:11.190 --> 02:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
it's it's a mandate it's law but we
 
02:53:11.200 --> 02:53:11.590 align:start position:0%
it's it's a mandate it's law but we
don't

02:53:11.590 --> 02:53:11.600 align:start position:0%
don't
 
02:53:15.830 --> 02:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
put it into the session into the actual
 
02:53:19.030 --> 02:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
statute books because it's one of those
 
02:53:19.910 --> 02:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
things that
 
02:53:23.670 --> 02:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
simply happens among a group of people
 
02:53:27.670 --> 02:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
and it gets done and our researchers and
 
02:53:27.680 --> 02:53:28.309 align:start position:0%
and it gets done and our researchers and
various

02:53:28.309 --> 02:53:28.319 align:start position:0%
various
 
02:53:31.110 --> 02:53:31.120 align:start position:0%
other people do actually pull their hair
 
02:53:31.120 --> 02:53:31.670 align:start position:0%
other people do actually pull their hair
out

02:53:31.670 --> 02:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:53:35.110 --> 02:53:35.120 align:start position:0%
tracking these things because they
 
02:53:37.910 --> 02:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
do get tracked they do not get forgotten
 
02:53:37.920 --> 02:53:38.870 align:start position:0%
do get tracked they do not get forgotten
and

02:53:38.870 --> 02:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:53:41.990 --> 02:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh people in the speaker's office also
 
02:53:45.510 --> 02:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
but this is just a freestanding mandate
 
02:53:45.520 --> 02:53:45.910 align:start position:0%
but this is just a freestanding mandate
to

02:53:45.910 --> 02:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:53:47.910 --> 02:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
a group of people to get together and
 
02:53:49.110 --> 02:53:49.120 align:start position:0%
form a plan
 
02:53:51.269 --> 02:53:51.279 align:start position:0%
so there isn't going to be a permanent
 
02:53:53.030 --> 02:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
home for it in the statutes
 
02:53:54.870 --> 02:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
because we hope that they will get
 
02:53:56.469 --> 02:53:56.479 align:start position:0%
together and form a plan
 
02:53:58.309 --> 02:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
and that will be presented to us at a
 
02:54:00.150 --> 02:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
further legislative session for our
 
02:54:00.160 --> 02:54:01.190 align:start position:0%
further legislative session for our
action

02:54:01.190 --> 02:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
action
 
02:54:03.030 --> 02:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
representative weber with the fact that
 
02:54:05.750 --> 02:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
it has a sunset provision this year
 
02:54:07.670 --> 02:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
be another reason why it would not go
 
02:54:07.680 --> 02:54:09.590 align:start position:0%
be another reason why it would not go
into

02:54:09.590 --> 02:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
into
 
02:54:13.349 --> 02:54:13.359 align:start position:0%
the logbooks exactly thank you
 
02:54:17.429 --> 02:54:17.439 align:start position:0%
any other comments questions
 
02:54:19.910 --> 02:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
can i just give representative cushman
 
02:54:21.670 --> 02:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
the eagle eye award for noting that
 
02:54:22.389 --> 02:54:22.399 align:start position:0%
though that's
 
02:54:25.670 --> 02:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
that was very good thank you one eagle
 
02:54:25.680 --> 02:54:26.070 align:start position:0%
that was very good thank you one eagle
eye

02:54:26.070 --> 02:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
eye
 
02:54:29.670 --> 02:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
award has been bestowed
 
02:54:32.950 --> 02:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:36.950 --> 02:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
someone else okay eagle eye cushman is
 
02:54:36.960 --> 02:54:38.389 align:start position:0%
someone else okay eagle eye cushman is
recognized

02:54:38.389 --> 02:54:38.399 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
02:54:42.309 --> 02:54:42.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman so i
 
02:54:45.349 --> 02:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
i do just have a bit of an issue i
 
02:54:48.870 --> 02:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
we discussed this um
 
02:54:52.150 --> 02:54:52.160 align:start position:0%
this interstate compact a bit about
 
02:54:54.070 --> 02:54:54.080 align:start position:0%
the placement of children and there was
 
02:54:55.830 --> 02:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
some debate
 
02:54:58.790 --> 02:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
on whether it becomes a federal program
 
02:54:59.590 --> 02:54:59.600 align:start position:0%
if we
 
02:55:03.030 --> 02:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
join it and then we lose our autonomy
 
02:55:04.150 --> 02:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
over it
 
02:55:07.429 --> 02:55:07.439 align:start position:0%
um and i know that representative folsom
 
02:55:09.590 --> 02:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
tried to reach out to multiple
 
02:55:11.590 --> 02:55:11.600 align:start position:0%
organizations who are involved in this
 
02:55:15.030 --> 02:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
and didn't receive any um feedback
 
02:55:16.630 --> 02:55:16.640 align:start position:0%
didn't receive any calls back
 
02:55:19.910 --> 02:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
um or email so i'm uncomfortable i think
 
02:55:20.630 --> 02:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
that this
 
02:55:23.750 --> 02:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
this part of the bill just totally
 
02:55:27.030 --> 02:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
is like doesn't fit in with everything
 
02:55:27.910 --> 02:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
else that this
 
02:55:31.349 --> 02:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
bill does um and it's like
 
02:55:35.030 --> 02:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
couched in the middle of the bill and
 
02:55:39.750 --> 02:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:42.870 --> 02:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
it's the major portion of the bill the
 
02:55:42.880 --> 02:55:51.670 align:start position:0%
it's the major portion of the bill the
interesting

02:55:51.670 --> 02:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:53.750 --> 02:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so i'm just not comfortable with
 
02:55:55.269 --> 02:55:55.279 align:start position:0%
this section of the bill at all and i
 
02:55:55.279 --> 02:55:55.670 align:start position:0%
this section of the bill at all and i
will

02:55:55.670 --> 02:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
will
 
02:55:58.790 --> 02:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
be voting in favor
 
02:56:02.469 --> 02:56:02.479 align:start position:0%
the side by side notes provided by
 
02:56:05.510 --> 02:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
christina daya read this way about this
 
02:56:05.520 --> 02:56:06.950 align:start position:0%
christina daya read this way about this
compact

02:56:06.950 --> 02:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
compact
 
02:56:11.510 --> 02:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
this is the 2009
 
02:56:13.750 --> 02:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
interstate compact for the placement of
 
02:56:13.760 --> 02:56:15.110 align:start position:0%
interstate compact for the placement of
children

02:56:15.110 --> 02:56:15.120 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:56:18.870 --> 02:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
persian which replaces the current
 
02:56:18.880 --> 02:56:19.830 align:start position:0%
persian which replaces the current
version

02:56:19.830 --> 02:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
version
 
02:56:23.349 --> 02:56:23.359 align:start position:0%
but is not in effect until passage by 35
 
02:56:25.990 --> 02:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
states that's what i'm reading
 
02:56:29.510 --> 02:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
refiling of 2020 senate bill 698
 
02:56:32.710 --> 02:56:32.720 align:start position:0%
at the request of dhhs this died on the
 
02:56:32.720 --> 02:56:33.269 align:start position:0%
at the request of dhhs this died on the

for what that's worth representative
snow

02:56:44.469 --> 02:56:44.479 align:start position:0%
snow
 
02:56:47.990 --> 02:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
no i didn't mr representative um
 
02:56:50.790 --> 02:56:50.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i spent some time
 
02:56:53.110 --> 02:56:53.120 align:start position:0%
working on section 48 as you know
 
02:56:55.830 --> 02:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
the amendment that we adopted did
 
02:56:55.840 --> 02:56:56.469 align:start position:0%
the amendment that we adopted did
incorporate

02:56:56.469 --> 02:56:56.479 align:start position:0%
incorporate
 
02:56:59.510 --> 02:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
some new provisions into section 48. uh
 
02:57:01.110 --> 02:57:01.120 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire has been part
 
02:57:02.950 --> 02:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
of the state compact replacement
 
02:57:05.910 --> 02:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
children since 1965
 
02:57:08.710 --> 02:57:08.720 align:start position:0%
however the compact has been updated and
 
02:57:10.630 --> 02:57:10.640 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this section of the bill
 
02:57:11.910 --> 02:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
is to update
 
02:57:15.349 --> 02:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
the current contact with the new compact
 
02:57:17.590 --> 02:57:17.600 align:start position:0%
once enough states have adopted the new
 
02:57:18.790 --> 02:57:18.800 align:start position:0%
compact that it becomes
 
02:57:22.230 --> 02:57:22.240 align:start position:0%
operational so in fact joel this does
 
02:57:22.240 --> 02:57:22.550 align:start position:0%
operational so in fact joel this does
not

02:57:22.550 --> 02:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:57:24.070 --> 02:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
change the fact that we've been part of
 
02:57:26.230 --> 02:57:26.240 align:start position:0%
this compact for
 
02:57:29.510 --> 02:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
that's 35 years uh without any harms to
 
02:57:31.190 --> 02:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire
 
02:57:33.030 --> 02:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
in fact it allows us to do things like
 
02:57:34.790 --> 02:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
have adoptions across the appliances
 
02:57:37.030 --> 02:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
things like that
 
02:57:38.950 --> 02:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
and therefore i very much support the
 
02:57:40.230 --> 02:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
section of the bill i think it's
 
02:57:41.750 --> 02:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
important for us to
 
02:57:45.269 --> 02:57:45.279 align:start position:0%
to keep up to date as this contract
 
02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:48.010 align:start position:0%
has been updated to reflect to
 
02:57:48.010 --> 02:57:53.429 align:start position:0%
has been updated to reflect to
[Music]

02:57:53.429 --> 02:57:53.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:55.190 --> 02:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
or anyone else happen to know how many
 
02:57:56.950 --> 02:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
states have thus far
 
02:58:00.309 --> 02:58:00.319 align:start position:0%
ratified this language uh what i do know
 
02:58:02.469 --> 02:58:02.479 align:start position:0%
is that it's unlikely that it will meet
 
02:58:04.070 --> 02:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
the 35 state threshold
 
02:58:06.550 --> 02:58:06.560 align:start position:0%
this year but of course that's not
 
02:58:06.560 --> 02:58:08.630 align:start position:0%
this year but of course that's not
necessary

02:58:08.630 --> 02:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
02:58:13.780 --> 02:58:13.790 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:13.790 --> 02:58:15.670 align:start position:0%

02:58:25.590 --> 02:58:25.600 align:start position:0%
weber had her hand up what was
 
02:58:29.269 --> 02:58:29.279 align:start position:0%
muted so um that's why
 
02:58:32.309 --> 02:58:32.319 align:start position:0%
uh and thank you i i just want to make
 
02:58:33.030 --> 02:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
it very
 
02:58:34.710 --> 02:58:34.720 align:start position:0%
clear i want to second everything that
 
02:58:36.550 --> 02:58:36.560 align:start position:0%
representative marsh said but i also
 
02:58:38.230 --> 02:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
want to make it very clear this does not
 
02:58:38.240 --> 02:58:39.110 align:start position:0%
want to make it very clear this does not
become

02:58:39.110 --> 02:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
become
 
02:58:42.790 --> 02:58:42.800 align:start position:0%
federal law all that ever happens with
 
02:58:42.800 --> 02:58:43.110 align:start position:0%
federal law all that ever happens with
us

02:58:43.110 --> 02:58:43.120 align:start position:0%
us
 
02:58:47.110 --> 02:58:47.120 align:start position:0%
is what we as a legislature have adopted
 
02:58:50.950 --> 02:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
and there's a further caveat
 
02:58:55.269 --> 02:58:55.279 align:start position:0%
that until 34 other legislatures
 
02:58:58.950 --> 02:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
also adopt similar measures it
 
02:59:01.750 --> 02:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
won't go into effect more broadly but
 
02:59:04.309 --> 02:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
when it goes into effect it will only go
 
02:59:05.590 --> 02:59:05.600 align:start position:0%
into effect
 
02:59:07.910 --> 02:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
for those states that have actually
 
02:59:09.910 --> 02:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
adopted the update
 
02:59:12.630 --> 02:59:12.640 align:start position:0%
um and and some of the other provisions
 
02:59:13.349 --> 02:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
02:59:16.469 --> 02:59:16.479 align:start position:0%
very helpful that are in this is it will
 
02:59:17.349 --> 02:59:17.359 align:start position:0%
make it much
 
02:59:21.269 --> 02:59:21.279 align:start position:0%
easier for a child in need of foster
 
02:59:21.279 --> 02:59:22.309 align:start position:0%
easier for a child in need of foster
care

02:59:22.309 --> 02:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
care
 
02:59:25.510 --> 02:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
to go into a relative placement
 
02:59:27.190 --> 02:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
say in the state of maine or the state
 
02:59:29.830 --> 02:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
of vermont or the state of massachusetts
 
02:59:32.389 --> 02:59:32.399 align:start position:0%
uh so that we can keep families as
 
02:59:34.309 --> 02:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
intact as possible
 
02:59:37.670 --> 02:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
when a child is in need of foster care
 
02:59:39.349 --> 02:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
rather than having to take that child
 
02:59:41.349 --> 02:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
and put it into a foster family
 
02:59:44.630 --> 02:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and
 
02:59:48.070 --> 02:59:48.080 align:start position:0%
it also allows us to track that child
 
02:59:50.710 --> 02:59:50.720 align:start position:0%
and make sure that that child is being
 
02:59:52.550 --> 02:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
dealt with appropriately when they're
 
02:59:54.550 --> 02:59:54.560 align:start position:0%
not physically in the state
 
02:59:57.750 --> 02:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
so i i think it's very useful
 
03:00:00.630 --> 03:00:00.640 align:start position:0%
going forward and it is just an update
 
03:00:02.309 --> 03:00:02.319 align:start position:0%
of something that's been in place for
 
03:00:02.319 --> 03:00:03.030 align:start position:0%
of something that's been in place for
about

03:00:03.030 --> 03:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:00:06.389 --> 03:00:06.399 align:start position:0%
for decades thank you representative
 
03:00:09.190 --> 03:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
weber the chair has a question for you
 
03:00:09.200 --> 03:00:09.510 align:start position:0%
weber the chair has a question for you
or

03:00:09.510 --> 03:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:00:11.990 --> 03:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
indeed anyone who may know the answer
 
03:00:13.670 --> 03:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
where does the number 35
 
03:00:17.590 --> 03:00:17.600 align:start position:0%
come from who says it has to be 35.
 
03:00:20.309 --> 03:00:20.319 align:start position:0%
it's it's contained in the bill
 
03:00:20.319 --> 03:00:21.110 align:start position:0%
it's it's contained in the bill
somewhere

03:00:21.110 --> 03:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
03:00:24.630 --> 03:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
and um i
 
03:00:27.830 --> 03:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
don't i will continue to look at it but
 
03:00:31.030 --> 03:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
ah it's on the top of page 11
 
03:00:34.389 --> 03:00:34.399 align:start position:0%
um on the effective date of this chapter
 
03:00:35.990 --> 03:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
based upon the enactment of the
 
03:00:37.910 --> 03:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
interstate compact for the placement of
 
03:00:41.030 --> 03:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
children into law by the 35th compacting
 
03:00:41.040 --> 03:00:41.910 align:start position:0%
children into law by the 35th compacting
state

03:00:41.910 --> 03:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:00:44.070 --> 03:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
the governor is authorized and directed
 
03:00:45.990 --> 03:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
to execute a compact
 
03:00:48.710 --> 03:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
on behalf of this state with any other
 
03:00:51.910 --> 03:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
state or states legally joining so
 
03:00:54.950 --> 03:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
once the 35th ratification comes through
 
03:00:55.910 --> 03:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
then the governor
 
03:00:59.030 --> 03:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
can uh execute the paperwork
 
03:01:02.630 --> 03:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
back and forth that i understood
 
03:01:06.309 --> 03:01:06.319 align:start position:0%
what i wonder is who says 35 did some
 
03:01:09.510 --> 03:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
state start with the bill it's
 
03:01:12.630 --> 03:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
quite common when you have one of these
 
03:01:12.640 --> 03:01:13.510 align:start position:0%
quite common when you have one of these
interstate

03:01:13.510 --> 03:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
interstate
 
03:01:16.790 --> 03:01:16.800 align:start position:0%
compacts that somebody comes
 
03:01:19.110 --> 03:01:19.120 align:start position:0%
up with a threshold number i'm
 
03:01:20.389 --> 03:01:20.399 align:start position:0%
remembering the last
 
03:01:23.510 --> 03:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
time we saw a threshold number
 
03:01:26.469 --> 03:01:26.479 align:start position:0%
like that was when we passed the sipe
 
03:01:26.479 --> 03:01:27.030 align:start position:0%
like that was when we passed the sipe
act

03:01:27.030 --> 03:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
act
 
03:01:30.389 --> 03:01:30.399 align:start position:0%
which was an interstate compact
 
03:01:34.230 --> 03:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
on allowing psychologists
 
03:01:38.550 --> 03:01:38.560 align:start position:0%
to um practice across state lines
 
03:01:40.950 --> 03:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
and i don't remember what the threshold
 
03:01:41.990 --> 03:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
in that was
 
03:01:45.030 --> 03:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
but there was one and
 
03:01:48.389 --> 03:01:48.399 align:start position:0%
um i think it was a much lower threshold
 
03:01:48.399 --> 03:01:49.429 align:start position:0%
um i think it was a much lower threshold
actually

03:01:49.429 --> 03:01:49.439 align:start position:0%
actually
 
03:01:52.830 --> 03:01:52.840 align:start position:0%
but again these are a matter of
 
03:01:56.309 --> 03:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
negotiation among states and among the
 
03:01:58.630 --> 03:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
drafters in the various states
 
03:02:01.670 --> 03:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
i know that for many of our uniform laws
 
03:02:01.680 --> 03:02:02.070 align:start position:0%
i know that for many of our uniform laws
there's

03:02:02.070 --> 03:02:02.080 align:start position:0%
there's
 
03:02:05.670 --> 03:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
actually an interstate commission
 
03:02:09.510 --> 03:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
on uniform laws like
 
03:02:12.070 --> 03:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
the uniform probate code or the uniform
 
03:02:13.910 --> 03:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
commercial code
 
03:02:17.269 --> 03:02:17.279 align:start position:0%
each state sends delegates they work out
 
03:02:19.910 --> 03:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
a new version and then each state does
 
03:02:21.590 --> 03:02:21.600 align:start position:0%
with the new version what the state
 
03:02:22.469 --> 03:02:22.479 align:start position:0%
wants to do
 
03:02:26.469 --> 03:02:26.479 align:start position:0%
so um the it's it's very
 
03:02:29.830 --> 03:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
much a collaborative effort but without
 
03:02:32.150 --> 03:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
the buy-in from individual states it
 
03:02:33.030 --> 03:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen
 
03:02:35.030 --> 03:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
well somebody started at one point there
 
03:02:37.030 --> 03:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
was a similar thing with radiologists
 
03:02:39.349 --> 03:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
that i've been meeting
 
03:02:41.429 --> 03:02:41.439 align:start position:0%
the issue is it's just two-thirds of the
 
03:02:42.950 --> 03:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
number of states that's probably why it
 
03:02:48.070 --> 03:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:51.429 --> 03:02:51.439 align:start position:0%
representative folsom thank you mr chair
 
03:02:54.710 --> 03:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
and um i am so glad representative weber
 
03:02:56.630 --> 03:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
is with us today because i've got a
 
03:02:58.870 --> 03:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
question for you
 
03:03:02.150 --> 03:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
it's a legal question and um it's one of
 
03:03:04.230 --> 03:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
the ones that i have to go online and
 
03:03:05.830 --> 03:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
look up because i couldn't get anybody
 
03:03:08.070 --> 03:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
to answer for me
 
03:03:11.990 --> 03:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
interstate compacts um
 
03:03:14.230 --> 03:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
i tried to find the answer to this
 
03:03:14.240 --> 03:03:15.110 align:start position:0%
i tried to find the answer to this
question

03:03:15.110 --> 03:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:03:18.630 --> 03:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
because uh the way i read it online
 
03:03:21.910 --> 03:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
is when an interstate compact
 
03:03:25.269 --> 03:03:25.279 align:start position:0%
is in effect and a state is part of it
 
03:03:28.469 --> 03:03:28.479 align:start position:0%
if the federal government creates rules
 
03:03:30.150 --> 03:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
or laws
 
03:03:33.349 --> 03:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
that differ from those of the individual
 
03:03:33.359 --> 03:03:34.309 align:start position:0%
that differ from those of the individual
states

03:03:34.309 --> 03:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
states
 
03:03:36.790 --> 03:03:36.800 align:start position:0%
that the federal law trumps the state
 
03:03:39.349 --> 03:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
law is that
 
03:03:43.750 --> 03:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
well that if if the interstate compact
 
03:03:46.710 --> 03:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
and because it's an interstate compact
 
03:03:49.190 --> 03:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
it's it's something that the federal
 
03:03:49.200 --> 03:03:49.910 align:start position:0%
it's it's something that the federal
government

03:03:49.910 --> 03:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
government
 
03:03:53.429 --> 03:03:53.439 align:start position:0%
also has some jurisdiction over it
 
03:03:56.469 --> 03:03:56.479 align:start position:0%
if the federal government decides to
 
03:03:58.790 --> 03:03:58.800 align:start position:0%
enact a law that conflicts
 
03:04:01.910 --> 03:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
in the same area that law would in fact
 
03:04:04.950 --> 03:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
control unless somebody successfully
 
03:04:06.710 --> 03:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
brings a lawsuit and says
 
03:04:08.790 --> 03:04:08.800 align:start position:0%
federal government this was not
 
03:04:11.110 --> 03:04:11.120 align:start position:0%
something that was delegated to the feds
 
03:04:12.790 --> 03:04:12.800 align:start position:0%
this is something that was reserved to
 
03:04:14.790 --> 03:04:14.800 align:start position:0%
the states um
 
03:04:17.830 --> 03:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
certainly the the care
 
03:04:20.790 --> 03:04:20.800 align:start position:0%
of children is something that is
 
03:04:20.800 --> 03:04:21.670 align:start position:0%
of children is something that is
reserved

03:04:21.670 --> 03:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
reserved
 
03:04:23.670 --> 03:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
generally speaking to the individual
 
03:04:23.680 --> 03:04:24.710 align:start position:0%
generally speaking to the individual
states

03:04:24.710 --> 03:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
states
 
03:04:27.910 --> 03:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure
 
03:04:30.550 --> 03:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
and and i'm not a constitutional scholar
 
03:04:31.510 --> 03:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm a long
 
03:04:34.790 --> 03:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
retired attorney so um i'm not
 
03:04:37.750 --> 03:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
sure how a challenge to this would be
 
03:04:39.910 --> 03:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
received if they enacted something in
 
03:04:40.950 --> 03:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
this area
 
03:04:43.429 --> 03:04:43.439 align:start position:0%
but whether we adopt a compact or
 
03:04:45.830 --> 03:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
whether we don't adopt a compact
 
03:04:47.590 --> 03:04:47.600 align:start position:0%
there they can do what they want to do
 
03:04:48.870 --> 03:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
anyway and again it's
 
03:04:51.349 --> 03:04:51.359 align:start position:0%
it's up to people in individual states
 
03:04:52.389 --> 03:04:52.399 align:start position:0%
who are affected
 
03:04:54.950 --> 03:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
to bring a challenge to whether they
 
03:04:57.190 --> 03:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
exceeded their federal authority or not
 
03:04:57.750 --> 03:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
and that
 
03:05:01.030 --> 03:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't be changed whether we
 
03:05:03.190 --> 03:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
adopt this compact or whether we reject
 
03:05:03.200 --> 03:05:04.389 align:start position:0%
adopt this compact or whether we reject
it

03:05:04.389 --> 03:05:04.399 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:05:07.750 --> 03:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i i was thinking the
 
03:05:09.750 --> 03:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
same thoughts but i needed a lawyer to
 
03:05:12.150 --> 03:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
say that
 
03:05:16.830 --> 03:05:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:16.840 --> 03:05:22.550 align:start position:0%
 
that

03:05:22.550 --> 03:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:24.790 --> 03:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
this is not just for questions this is
 
03:05:25.990 --> 03:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
an exact session
 
03:05:30.230 --> 03:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
so it can be sharing a statement
 
03:05:32.150 --> 03:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
representative gay has called for thank
 
03:05:34.070 --> 03:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
you for allowing me to ask
 
03:05:36.150 --> 03:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
uh this probably really is for our
 
03:05:36.160 --> 03:05:37.670 align:start position:0%
uh this probably really is for our
representative

03:05:37.670 --> 03:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:05:40.550 --> 03:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
can other states is there a list of 35
 
03:05:41.830 --> 03:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
who've already been
 
03:05:45.030 --> 03:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh sharing this responsibility or is
 
03:05:46.070 --> 03:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
this just a number
 
03:05:50.070 --> 03:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
in any state could choose to join
 
03:05:52.710 --> 03:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
there is undoubtedly somewhere a list of
 
03:05:55.670 --> 03:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
those who have adopted it already
 
03:05:58.710 --> 03:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
i don't happen to have that list it
 
03:06:00.230 --> 03:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
would be a great question
 
03:06:04.150 --> 03:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
to ask ms dyer or the folks at ols who
 
03:06:05.830 --> 03:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
do research for individual
 
03:06:05.840 --> 03:06:07.349 align:start position:0%
do research for individual
representatives

03:06:07.349 --> 03:06:07.359 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
03:06:11.510 --> 03:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh i i don't um it it certainly
 
03:06:14.710 --> 03:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
has already been passed by the threshold
 
03:06:16.230 --> 03:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
number of states
 
03:06:19.510 --> 03:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
in some of its earlier versions because
 
03:06:22.389 --> 03:06:22.399 align:start position:0%
we operate with it now we we already had
 
03:06:23.750 --> 03:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
it in law
 
03:06:26.790 --> 03:06:26.800 align:start position:0%
and what we have currently in law is
 
03:06:28.550 --> 03:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
cumbersome and clunky
 
03:06:30.870 --> 03:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
and of course because they repealed the
 
03:06:33.590 --> 03:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
whole thing and didn't
 
03:06:35.269 --> 03:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
do the usual thing that we have with
 
03:06:37.830 --> 03:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
line out and replacements
 
03:06:40.870 --> 03:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
you don't see that but
 
03:06:43.990 --> 03:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
this simply allows um
 
03:06:47.110 --> 03:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
more more cooperation and and
 
03:06:50.309 --> 03:06:50.319 align:start position:0%
more reaction to the currents
 
03:06:52.870 --> 03:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
the current issues than than something
 
03:06:52.880 --> 03:06:54.469 align:start position:0%
the current issues than than something
that's

03:06:54.469 --> 03:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:06:58.389 --> 03:06:58.399 align:start position:0%
significantly older less clunky
 
03:07:01.910 --> 03:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
what's clunky um this is the chair it's
 
03:07:03.990 --> 03:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
interesting to me that what is before us
 
03:07:05.990 --> 03:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
is the 2009
 
03:07:09.349 --> 03:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
version it's just 12 years old and like
 
03:07:11.429 --> 03:07:11.439 align:start position:0%
some amendments to the constitution that
 
03:07:13.190 --> 03:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
have been proposed
 
03:07:14.870 --> 03:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
we haven't got to the threshold yet
 
03:07:16.630 --> 03:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
we're 12 years late
 
03:07:18.630 --> 03:07:18.640 align:start position:0%
into the game and we haven't hit the
 
03:07:21.110 --> 03:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
magical 35.
 
03:07:23.830 --> 03:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
just a comment just an observation uh
 
03:07:25.110 --> 03:07:25.120 align:start position:0%
representative folsom
 
03:07:27.190 --> 03:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
um just for information the interstate
 
03:07:29.190 --> 03:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
compact uh for the placement children
 
03:07:30.950 --> 03:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
has a website
 
03:07:33.670 --> 03:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
so you can find out a whole bunch about
 
03:07:34.550 --> 03:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
it online
 
03:07:37.910 --> 03:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
very easy to find just not the rules
 
03:07:37.920 --> 03:07:39.750 align:start position:0%
very easy to find just not the rules
representative

03:07:39.750 --> 03:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:07:41.830 --> 03:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman so one of my
 
03:07:41.840 --> 03:07:43.190 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman so one of my
concerns

03:07:43.190 --> 03:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
03:07:45.030 --> 03:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
and correct me if i'm wrong someone who
 
03:07:46.790 --> 03:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
may know better
 
03:07:50.389 --> 03:07:50.399 align:start position:0%
um except on page 16
 
03:07:54.550 --> 03:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
of the bill we're in section 4
 
03:07:58.550 --> 03:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
and it's roman rule 7.
 
03:08:00.630 --> 03:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
it says nothing in this article shall
 
03:08:02.550 --> 03:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
limit the receiving state's ability to
 
03:08:04.389 --> 03:08:04.399 align:start position:0%
take emergency jurisdiction for the
 
03:08:08.389 --> 03:08:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:11.110 --> 03:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
it at first it says in the uh the
 
03:08:12.550 --> 03:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
beginning of that section you know
 
03:08:12.560 --> 03:08:13.110 align:start position:0%
beginning of that section you know
accepted

03:08:13.110 --> 03:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
accepted
 
03:08:16.950 --> 03:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
as provided in article seven um
 
03:08:20.550 --> 03:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
sorry as provided in articles
 
03:08:23.990 --> 03:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
for paragraph eight and
 
03:08:27.349 --> 03:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
five that
 
03:08:30.230 --> 03:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
the original state you know has
 
03:08:33.030 --> 03:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over this child
 
03:08:35.110 --> 03:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
but then it says that the state that
 
03:08:36.630 --> 03:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
they the child gets sent
 
03:08:40.630 --> 03:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
to um the receiving state
 
03:08:41.910 --> 03:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
has the ability to take over
 
03:08:44.870 --> 03:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of that child
 
03:08:47.830 --> 03:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
so that's really concerning to me so if
 
03:08:49.190 --> 03:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
they go to another state and they have
 
03:08:49.200 --> 03:08:49.750 align:start position:0%
they go to another state and they have
different

03:08:49.750 --> 03:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
different
 
03:08:52.870 --> 03:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
child protection laws um and they're
 
03:08:54.950 --> 03:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
with their relative
 
03:08:58.230 --> 03:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
and now all of a sudden that state
 
03:08:59.670 --> 03:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
takes jurisdiction of the child and
 
03:09:01.990 --> 03:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
places it someone else
 
03:09:06.230 --> 03:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
representative weber i believe that what
 
03:09:06.240 --> 03:09:06.630 align:start position:0%
representative weber i believe that what
this

03:09:06.630 --> 03:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:09:10.309 --> 03:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
does is that it allows another state if
 
03:09:11.429 --> 03:09:11.439 align:start position:0%
a child is found
 
03:09:14.150 --> 03:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
wandering on the street with no shoes to
 
03:09:15.990 --> 03:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
take immediate jurisdiction over
 
03:09:18.469 --> 03:09:18.479 align:start position:0%
that child and make take immediate
 
03:09:18.479 --> 03:09:19.110 align:start position:0%
that child and make take immediate
prevent

03:09:19.110 --> 03:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
prevent
 
03:09:21.190 --> 03:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
prevent measures for the protection of
 
03:09:23.750 --> 03:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
the child it's truly an emergency
 
03:09:26.950 --> 03:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
provision it does
 
03:09:30.150 --> 03:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
not because
 
03:09:32.469 --> 03:09:32.479 align:start position:0%
otherwise if we didn't have that savings
 
03:09:32.479 --> 03:09:33.510 align:start position:0%
otherwise if we didn't have that savings
clause

03:09:33.510 --> 03:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
clause
 
03:09:35.590 --> 03:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
uh a child wandering around on the
 
03:09:38.229 --> 03:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
street unsupervised
 
03:09:40.150 --> 03:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
they would have to try and figure out
 
03:09:41.830 --> 03:09:41.840 align:start position:0%
where the original state was they
 
03:09:42.630 --> 03:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't know
 
03:09:44.309 --> 03:09:44.319 align:start position:0%
because the child might be young enough
 
03:09:46.630 --> 03:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
not to be able to tell them
 
03:09:49.429 --> 03:09:49.439 align:start position:0%
so it's simply my understanding of
 
03:09:51.110 --> 03:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
provisions like this
 
03:09:54.309 --> 03:09:54.319 align:start position:0%
is it simply allows an emergency action
 
03:09:55.590 --> 03:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
to be taken
 
03:09:57.590 --> 03:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
to make sure that a child who's in
 
03:09:59.269 --> 03:09:59.279 align:start position:0%
jeopardy either from
 
03:10:01.349 --> 03:10:01.359 align:start position:0%
another person or because they've gotten
 
03:10:02.469 --> 03:10:02.479 align:start position:0%
lost or
 
03:10:06.389 --> 03:10:06.399 align:start position:0%
whatever has happened to the child
 
03:10:08.870 --> 03:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
and and look after the child while
 
03:10:10.950 --> 03:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
they're making the inquiries about the
 
03:10:13.030 --> 03:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
proper jurisdiction for looking after
 
03:10:13.670 --> 03:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
the child
 
03:10:15.590 --> 03:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
and the proper communications that are
 
03:10:17.910 --> 03:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
set out in the rest of the statute
 
03:10:20.469 --> 03:10:20.479 align:start position:0%
but it's only in an emergency this is
 
03:10:22.229 --> 03:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
the chair speaking
 
03:10:25.510 --> 03:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
since i do not have in front of me
 
03:10:28.309 --> 03:10:28.319 align:start position:0%
the version that is currently operative
 
03:10:30.389 --> 03:10:30.399 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
03:10:33.429 --> 03:10:33.439 align:start position:0%
which predates the 2009 version which is
 
03:10:34.710 --> 03:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
before us
 
03:10:37.030 --> 03:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
i have no way of knowing if such
 
03:10:38.950 --> 03:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
emergency jurisdictions
 
03:10:41.510 --> 03:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
are already operative in new hampshire a
 
03:10:43.030 --> 03:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
lot of this stuff i'm sure
 
03:10:45.590 --> 03:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
isn't original it's updated it's some
 
03:10:45.600 --> 03:10:46.630 align:start position:0%
isn't original it's updated it's some
change

03:10:46.630 --> 03:10:46.640 align:start position:0%
change
 
03:10:48.870 --> 03:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
made here and there but i'm willing to
 
03:10:50.950 --> 03:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
bet a good chunk of this
 
03:10:54.469 --> 03:10:54.479 align:start position:0%
uh interstate compact um we're already
 
03:10:55.510 --> 03:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
doing it
 
03:10:59.349 --> 03:10:59.359 align:start position:0%
because an earlier version has it
 
03:11:01.990 --> 03:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
that's just a guess on my part but um i
 
03:11:03.510 --> 03:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
think i'm not solid grounded
 
03:11:04.790 --> 03:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
representative marsh
 
03:11:06.790 --> 03:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
mr chair i'm sorry i can't give you a
 
03:11:08.630 --> 03:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
page in line reference because i run out
 
03:11:10.710 --> 03:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
of tower in my laptop
 
03:11:13.670 --> 03:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
but but uh there is another section of
 
03:11:15.190 --> 03:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
the interstate contact
 
03:11:17.830 --> 03:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
which uh outlines the court procedures
 
03:11:19.269 --> 03:11:19.279 align:start position:0%
which must be followed
 
03:11:22.309 --> 03:11:22.319 align:start position:0%
if a ascending state is giving up its
 
03:11:23.349 --> 03:11:23.359 align:start position:0%
authority over
 
03:11:25.830 --> 03:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
a child which has been sent uh and so
 
03:11:28.229 --> 03:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
that's very clearly specified in the uh
 
03:11:31.429 --> 03:11:31.439 align:start position:0%
in the uh bill and uh if somebody wants
 
03:11:33.110 --> 03:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
to hand you a paper copy i'll be glad to
 
03:11:34.790 --> 03:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
find you the facebook live
 
03:11:38.389 --> 03:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
show yes i'm i'm
 
03:11:41.910 --> 03:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
working on finding also but okay let's
 
03:11:42.870 --> 03:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
give us a few
 
03:11:46.469 --> 03:11:46.479 align:start position:0%
minutes to do that
 
03:11:49.990 --> 03:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
before we move on well actually
 
03:11:52.389 --> 03:11:52.399 align:start position:0%
by the way it is it's you go to just the
 
03:11:54.870 --> 03:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
statutes 170 a is the current one that
 
03:11:56.229 --> 03:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
we have
 
03:12:00.309 --> 03:12:00.319 align:start position:0%
um mr chairman you haven't
 
03:12:06.630 --> 03:12:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:08.309 --> 03:12:08.319 align:start position:0%
those who are questioning this will want
 
03:12:10.630 --> 03:12:10.640 align:start position:0%
to pay attention to this discussion and
 
03:12:11.910 --> 03:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
not have a separate one
 
03:12:17.510 --> 03:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:19.910 --> 03:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
i'm says i cannot hear mr chairman
 
03:12:21.990 --> 03:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
conversation and it's this one
 
03:12:26.070 --> 03:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
go ahead yes the bill reads on page 15
 
03:12:29.110 --> 03:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
starting with line 35 in accordance with
 
03:12:31.190 --> 03:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
its own laws the court in the sending
 
03:12:33.110 --> 03:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
state shall have authority
 
03:12:35.990 --> 03:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's jurisdiction yes a the child is
 
03:12:37.429 --> 03:12:37.439 align:start position:0%
reunified with the parent in the
 
03:12:39.190 --> 03:12:39.200 align:start position:0%
receiving stage with the subject of
 
03:12:39.200 --> 03:12:40.229 align:start position:0%
receiving stage with the subject of
allegations

03:12:40.229 --> 03:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
allegations
 
03:12:42.710 --> 03:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
or finances of abuse for neglect only
 
03:12:44.150 --> 03:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
with the concurrence of the public
 
03:12:45.429 --> 03:12:45.439 align:start position:0%
child place against the scene in the
 
03:12:48.389 --> 03:12:48.399 align:start position:0%
receiving state b the child is adopted
 
03:12:50.309 --> 03:12:50.319 align:start position:0%
c the child reaches the age of majority
 
03:12:51.429 --> 03:12:51.439 align:start position:0%
under the laws
 
03:12:54.309 --> 03:12:54.319 align:start position:0%
of state the child achieves legal
 
03:12:56.070 --> 03:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
independence pursuant to the law of the
 
03:12:57.269 --> 03:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
senate state
 
03:13:10.389 --> 03:13:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:12.229 --> 03:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
agency of descending state request
 
03:13:13.990 --> 03:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
termination has obtained
 
03:13:15.750 --> 03:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
the concurrence of the public child
 
03:13:18.389 --> 03:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
presence agency receiving state
 
03:13:21.110 --> 03:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
and uh so i i believe that those are
 
03:13:22.550 --> 03:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
adequate protections
 
03:13:25.110 --> 03:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
for children who may be sent to other
 
03:13:25.120 --> 03:13:26.309 align:start position:0%
for children who may be sent to other
jurisdictions

03:13:26.309 --> 03:13:26.319 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions
 
03:13:29.269 --> 03:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
so then it would be fair to assume that
 
03:13:29.279 --> 03:13:30.950 align:start position:0%
so then it would be fair to assume that
emergency

03:13:30.950 --> 03:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
03:13:33.190 --> 03:13:33.200 align:start position:0%
is exactly that it is representative
 
03:13:33.200 --> 03:13:34.150 align:start position:0%
is exactly that it is representative
weber's

03:13:34.150 --> 03:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
weber's
 
03:13:36.469 --> 03:13:36.479 align:start position:0%
uh example of a child wandering around
 
03:13:36.479 --> 03:13:38.070 align:start position:0%
uh example of a child wandering around
barefoot

03:13:38.070 --> 03:13:38.080 align:start position:0%
barefoot
 
03:13:40.870 --> 03:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
but not just some arbitrary or keeping a
 
03:13:40.880 --> 03:13:45.429 align:start position:0%
but not just some arbitrary or keeping a
kid

03:13:45.429 --> 03:13:45.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:48.870 --> 03:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman so i'm
 
03:13:51.110 --> 03:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
my uh concerns are still not alleviated
 
03:13:52.950 --> 03:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
because there's no language in here that
 
03:13:52.960 --> 03:13:53.349 align:start position:0%
because there's no language in here that
says

03:13:53.349 --> 03:13:53.359 align:start position:0%
says
 
03:13:55.510 --> 03:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
you know oh they can take jurisdiction
 
03:13:56.550 --> 03:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
for an emergency
 
03:13:57.910 --> 03:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
and then they need to be sent
 
03:14:00.710 --> 03:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
immediately back to the original
 
03:14:03.510 --> 03:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh ascending state you know if they take
 
03:14:04.710 --> 03:14:04.720 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over the
 
03:14:07.110 --> 03:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
to over the child do they not then have
 
03:14:08.229 --> 03:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
the authority to
 
03:14:11.510 --> 03:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
place that child in a foster home
 
03:14:13.670 --> 03:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
in the state where they have
 
03:14:13.680 --> 03:14:17.990 align:start position:0%
in the state where they have
jurisdiction

03:14:17.990 --> 03:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:20.070 --> 03:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
if this is the chairman it would seem to
 
03:14:21.990 --> 03:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
me that once the emergency
 
03:14:25.830 --> 03:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
is over we revert to the rules that are
 
03:14:26.950 --> 03:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
in place
 
03:14:28.550 --> 03:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
vis-a-vis the sending state in the
 
03:14:30.550 --> 03:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
receiving state emergency is over the
 
03:14:30.560 --> 03:14:31.349 align:start position:0%
receiving state emergency is over the
child

03:14:31.349 --> 03:14:31.359 align:start position:0%
child
 
03:14:34.229 --> 03:14:34.239 align:start position:0%
is back where the child should be and
 
03:14:35.349 --> 03:14:35.359 align:start position:0%
has shoes on
 
03:14:37.190 --> 03:14:37.200 align:start position:0%
and so the emergency is over so we
 
03:14:39.110 --> 03:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
continue as as we have been
 
03:14:41.910 --> 03:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
i mean that's exactly why but what if
 
03:14:43.030 --> 03:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
the emergency
 
03:14:45.750 --> 03:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
is they deem the parent that the sending
 
03:14:45.760 --> 03:14:46.630 align:start position:0%
is they deem the parent that the sending
state

03:14:46.630 --> 03:14:46.640 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:14:49.349 --> 03:14:49.359 align:start position:0%
sent it to is somehow unfit so they take
 
03:14:51.269 --> 03:14:51.279 align:start position:0%
emergency custody of the child which is
 
03:14:52.150 --> 03:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
very common
 
03:14:54.469 --> 03:14:54.479 align:start position:0%
to happen now they have jurisdiction
 
03:14:55.590 --> 03:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
over that child
 
03:14:58.630 --> 03:14:58.640 align:start position:0%
and do they there's is there something
 
03:15:00.870 --> 03:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
to require them to send the child back
 
03:15:03.590 --> 03:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
to the sending state for their
 
03:15:05.110 --> 03:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction to
 
03:15:07.990 --> 03:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
representative marsh uh yes if they
 
03:15:09.830 --> 03:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
those states have adopted the interstate
 
03:15:13.110 --> 03:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
compact they have to abide by provisions
 
03:15:15.349 --> 03:15:15.359 align:start position:0%
that's why we have an interstate company
 
03:15:17.030 --> 03:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
if there was not an in this big contract
 
03:15:18.070 --> 03:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
you'd be correct
 
03:15:19.830 --> 03:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
that there would be no reason that the
 
03:15:21.349 --> 03:15:21.359 align:start position:0%
other state you have to send each other
 
03:15:25.030 --> 03:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
right representative
 
03:15:26.950 --> 03:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
snow you've been a social worker for a
 
03:15:31.349 --> 03:15:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:34.469 --> 03:15:34.479 align:start position:0%
but i also think one of the factors we
 
03:15:36.469 --> 03:15:36.479 align:start position:0%
should look at since 2009
 
03:15:38.710 --> 03:15:38.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has brought into place
 
03:15:40.790 --> 03:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
what's called a child advocate that wore
 
03:15:40.800 --> 03:15:41.510 align:start position:0%
what's called a child advocate that wore
up

03:15:41.510 --> 03:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
up
 
03:15:44.710 --> 03:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
and i think the current role you know
 
03:15:45.750 --> 03:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
the substantial
 
03:15:51.030 --> 03:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:53.510 --> 03:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
i think we have to kind of evaluate that
 
03:15:54.309 --> 03:15:54.319 align:start position:0%
but that's a
 
03:15:57.150 --> 03:15:57.160 align:start position:0%
big change from where we were in this
 
03:15:59.830 --> 03:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
2009 original
 
03:15:59.840 --> 03:16:03.349 align:start position:0%
2009 original
contemplated

03:16:03.349 --> 03:16:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:07.110 --> 03:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
well actually what we have before us is
 
03:16:08.309 --> 03:16:08.319 align:start position:0%
the 2009
 
03:16:11.510 --> 03:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
version yeah yeah and your experience
 
03:16:12.150 --> 03:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
with the
 
03:16:15.349 --> 03:16:15.359 align:start position:0%
child's advocate is now we have a person
 
03:16:17.349 --> 03:16:17.359 align:start position:0%
who does exactly what the title says
 
03:16:20.469 --> 03:16:20.479 align:start position:0%
advocates for the child so if this child
 
03:16:23.910 --> 03:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
is centering young the advocate still
 
03:16:26.870 --> 03:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
has interest in their child my
 
03:16:29.030 --> 03:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
assumption is that if a decision is made
 
03:16:31.269 --> 03:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
say by dcyf to send a child
 
03:16:35.590 --> 03:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
somewhere else that child advocate
 
03:16:37.110 --> 03:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
would play a role in this and could
 
03:16:38.870 --> 03:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
either recommend
 
03:16:42.309 --> 03:16:42.319 align:start position:0%
or discontinue the action
 
03:16:44.630 --> 03:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
that's her role to look what's best for
 
03:16:45.750 --> 03:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
the child
 
03:16:47.670 --> 03:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
what is going to best protect this child
 
03:16:51.349 --> 03:16:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:53.590 --> 03:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
you know decision made by one agency
 
03:16:56.790 --> 03:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
would not necessarily go
 
03:16:59.349 --> 03:16:59.359 align:start position:0%
into that situation thank you
 
03:17:01.590 --> 03:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
representative snow do i see your hand
 
03:17:05.110 --> 03:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
on the screen yes representative weber
 
03:17:07.269 --> 03:17:07.279 align:start position:0%
and mostly representative shapiro
 
03:17:09.750 --> 03:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative uh weber
 
03:17:11.750 --> 03:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
you may go first and then representative
 
03:17:11.760 --> 03:17:13.349 align:start position:0%
you may go first and then representative
shapiro

03:17:13.349 --> 03:17:13.359 align:start position:0%
shapiro
 
03:17:15.990 --> 03:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
i i think we need to be a little careful
 
03:17:17.269 --> 03:17:17.279 align:start position:0%
with the role of the
 
03:17:20.229 --> 03:17:20.239 align:start position:0%
uh office of the child advocate that
 
03:17:22.070 --> 03:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
office is not automatically
 
03:17:25.269 --> 03:17:25.279 align:start position:0%
involved in every case but
 
03:17:28.229 --> 03:17:28.239 align:start position:0%
the fact is that whether a child is in
 
03:17:29.990 --> 03:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
placement here
 
03:17:33.830 --> 03:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
or in placement in another state
 
03:17:36.469 --> 03:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
if a parent or family member is
 
03:17:38.710 --> 03:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
concerned about that child are concerned
 
03:17:40.710 --> 03:17:40.720 align:start position:0%
about how dcyf
 
03:17:43.990 --> 03:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
has handled a particular case they can
 
03:17:47.030 --> 03:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
certainly and certainly will receive a
 
03:17:48.469 --> 03:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
complaint here
 
03:17:50.950 --> 03:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
and follow up on that and i certainly
 
03:17:50.960 --> 03:17:51.910 align:start position:0%
and follow up on that and i certainly
have

03:17:51.910 --> 03:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:17:55.429 --> 03:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
referred a number of people who have
 
03:17:58.309 --> 03:17:58.319 align:start position:0%
concerns about how their case has been
 
03:17:58.319 --> 03:17:59.510 align:start position:0%
concerns about how their case has been
handled

03:17:59.510 --> 03:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
handled
 
03:18:03.630 --> 03:18:03.640 align:start position:0%
by dcyf both to the ombudsman within
 
03:18:03.640 --> 03:18:05.110 align:start position:0%
by dcyf both to the ombudsman within
dcyf

03:18:05.110 --> 03:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
dcyf
 
03:18:08.150 --> 03:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
and to the office of child advocacy
 
03:18:10.550 --> 03:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
so that whatever issues have come up can
 
03:18:12.630 --> 03:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
be resolved and and they certainly will
 
03:18:13.990 --> 03:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
help in that way
 
03:18:17.190 --> 03:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
and uh the other thing i will say is
 
03:18:17.200 --> 03:18:17.830 align:start position:0%
and uh the other thing i will say is
that

03:18:17.830 --> 03:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:18:21.190 --> 03:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
in my experience if the office of the
 
03:18:21.200 --> 03:18:21.590 align:start position:0%
in my experience if the office of the
child

03:18:21.590 --> 03:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
child
 
03:18:24.229 --> 03:18:24.239 align:start position:0%
advocate perceives a pattern that they
 
03:18:24.239 --> 03:18:24.630 align:start position:0%
advocate perceives a pattern that they
find

03:18:24.630 --> 03:18:24.640 align:start position:0%
find
 
03:18:27.269 --> 03:18:27.279 align:start position:0%
troubling on behalf of a group of
 
03:18:27.279 --> 03:18:27.990 align:start position:0%
troubling on behalf of a group of
children

03:18:27.990 --> 03:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
children
 
03:18:31.190 --> 03:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
they have been fierce in detailing
 
03:18:34.309 --> 03:18:34.319 align:start position:0%
those problems and working to get them
 
03:18:35.750 --> 03:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
fixed whether that requires a
 
03:18:38.790 --> 03:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
legislative fix or something else
 
03:18:40.229 --> 03:18:40.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative the chair
 
03:18:43.990 --> 03:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative shapiro
 
03:18:47.830 --> 03:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um as a
 
03:18:51.190 --> 03:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
as a former family and child therapist
 
03:18:53.750 --> 03:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
and also as a former child protective
 
03:18:56.870 --> 03:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
services worker in vermont
 
03:18:59.910 --> 03:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
i think it's important while we're while
 
03:19:02.229 --> 03:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
we're analyzing this and being careful
 
03:19:05.510 --> 03:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
that it's written well we should also
 
03:19:07.030 --> 03:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
keep in mind that
 
03:19:09.990 --> 03:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
without new hampshire being part of this
 
03:19:10.710 --> 03:19:10.720 align:start position:0%
we would be
 
03:19:13.190 --> 03:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
um in great trouble this is something
 
03:19:15.830 --> 03:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
that's used fairly frequently
 
03:19:19.510 --> 03:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
it's used um you know it's used
 
03:19:22.229 --> 03:19:22.239 align:start position:0%
as representative weber said to place
 
03:19:22.950 --> 03:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
kids with
 
03:19:26.389 --> 03:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
um family rather than in institutions
 
03:19:29.269 --> 03:19:29.279 align:start position:0%
and i think that without joining this
 
03:19:29.279 --> 03:19:30.150 align:start position:0%
and i think that without joining this
impact

03:19:30.150 --> 03:19:30.160 align:start position:0%
impact
 
03:19:34.070 --> 03:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
this compact um we would be at a great
 
03:19:34.080 --> 03:19:35.190 align:start position:0%
this compact um we would be at a great
disadvantage

03:19:35.190 --> 03:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
disadvantage
 
03:19:36.950 --> 03:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
and there are many many checks and
 
03:19:39.030 --> 03:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
balances if things go wrong
 
03:19:42.389 --> 03:19:42.399 align:start position:0%
including um the courts because
 
03:19:44.950 --> 03:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
kids have to be adjudicated to be in the
 
03:19:44.960 --> 03:19:45.990 align:start position:0%
kids have to be adjudicated to be in the
system

03:19:45.990 --> 03:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
system
 
03:19:49.510 --> 03:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
um and families um
 
03:19:51.349 --> 03:19:51.359 align:start position:0%
can go to court and there are regular
 
03:19:53.190 --> 03:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
court hearings so i think there are many
 
03:19:54.469 --> 03:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
checks and balances
 
03:19:57.110 --> 03:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
and we have to remember that this is um
 
03:20:00.710 --> 03:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
a very important thing for us to have um
 
03:20:02.710 --> 03:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
because it really serves the well-being
 
03:20:03.750 --> 03:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
of children
 
03:20:07.110 --> 03:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
and families representative shapiro am i
 
03:20:08.389 --> 03:20:08.399 align:start position:0%
correct to infer
 
03:20:11.190 --> 03:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
from what you said that we are not
 
03:20:16.150 --> 03:20:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:18.630 --> 03:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
uh my understanding from this discussion
 
03:20:20.630 --> 03:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
is that we are in an inter
 
03:20:23.670 --> 03:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
in a compact but it is uh an older
 
03:20:23.680 --> 03:20:24.469 align:start position:0%
in a compact but it is uh an older
compact

03:20:24.469 --> 03:20:24.479 align:start position:0%
compact
 
03:20:27.030 --> 03:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
um and this is an attempt to update it
 
03:20:27.040 --> 03:20:27.990 align:start position:0%
um and this is an attempt to update it
okay

03:20:27.990 --> 03:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:20:30.469 --> 03:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
it would be difficult for me not having
 
03:20:32.710 --> 03:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
the older compact in front of me
 
03:20:34.630 --> 03:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
to know where we are simply carrying
 
03:20:37.269 --> 03:20:37.279 align:start position:0%
over things and where we are making
 
03:20:40.550 --> 03:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
positive changes mr chair may i speak to
 
03:20:40.560 --> 03:20:41.110 align:start position:0%
positive changes mr chair may i speak to
that

03:20:41.110 --> 03:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:20:43.030 --> 03:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
i represent to that point yes
 
03:20:44.790 --> 03:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
representative conor yes
 
03:20:48.150 --> 03:20:48.160 align:start position:0%
um the website has all this on it
 
03:20:50.309 --> 03:20:50.319 align:start position:0%
um if you and this was actually what
 
03:20:52.229 --> 03:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
christina dyer initially sent us she
 
03:20:53.830 --> 03:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
sent us a link to it
 
03:20:58.229 --> 03:20:58.239 align:start position:0%
it's a a p as in peterhsa.org
 
03:20:59.990 --> 03:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
anybody you can also google interstate
 
03:21:01.830 --> 03:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
compact for placement of children
 
03:21:04.790 --> 03:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
um but it's yes we are part of that all
 
03:21:06.550 --> 03:21:06.560 align:start position:0%
50 states are part of this compact
 
03:21:06.560 --> 03:21:07.349 align:start position:0%
50 states are part of this compact
already

03:21:07.349 --> 03:21:07.359 align:start position:0%
already
 
03:21:10.710 --> 03:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
this is simply an uh a new version
 
03:21:12.309 --> 03:21:12.319 align:start position:0%
and it is actually again does not go
 
03:21:14.309 --> 03:21:14.319 align:start position:0%
into effect until 35 states
 
03:21:18.070 --> 03:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
11 states have approved the new version
 
03:21:20.229 --> 03:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
um it's been introduced in arizona it's
 
03:21:22.710 --> 03:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
been passed by one chamber in kentucky
 
03:21:24.389 --> 03:21:24.399 align:start position:0%
but their map is not up to date because
 
03:21:26.309 --> 03:21:26.319 align:start position:0%
they don't have it enacted in our chain
 
03:21:27.510 --> 03:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
you know that it's been passed in our
 
03:21:29.830 --> 03:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
chamber they do have a side-by-side
 
03:21:29.840 --> 03:21:30.870 align:start position:0%
chamber they do have a side-by-side
comparison

03:21:30.870 --> 03:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
comparison
 
03:21:33.110 --> 03:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
if desired i could send that link to the
 
03:21:34.389 --> 03:21:34.399 align:start position:0%
entire committee
 
03:21:37.269 --> 03:21:37.279 align:start position:0%
um and that would give you that i would
 
03:21:39.429 --> 03:21:39.439 align:start position:0%
appreciate that for my edification i'm
 
03:21:40.630 --> 03:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
not sure that
 
03:21:43.910 --> 03:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh we would have it in time um i really
 
03:21:46.229 --> 03:21:46.239 align:start position:0%
do hope you get done with this today
 
03:21:48.389 --> 03:21:48.399 align:start position:0%
and not have to come back next week well
 
03:21:50.710 --> 03:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
a follow-up i do not think we should
 
03:21:53.349 --> 03:21:53.359 align:start position:0%
delay what we're doing this is just an
 
03:21:53.359 --> 03:21:54.309 align:start position:0%
delay what we're doing this is just an
update

03:21:54.309 --> 03:21:54.319 align:start position:0%
update
 
03:21:56.229 --> 03:21:56.239 align:start position:0%
to bring us up to date the point is we
 
03:21:57.910 --> 03:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
are already in a compact
 
03:22:00.469 --> 03:22:00.479 align:start position:0%
that we need i think we should pass this
 
03:22:01.670 --> 03:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
so we can just be
 
03:22:05.030 --> 03:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
to the revised new but again it doesn't
 
03:22:05.830 --> 03:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
going to take effect
 
03:22:08.790 --> 03:22:08.800 align:start position:0%
until two-thirds of the states uh have
 
03:22:10.710 --> 03:22:10.720 align:start position:0%
agreed with this and then we had
 
03:22:12.790 --> 03:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
then we can go ahead and proceed with it
 
03:22:14.790 --> 03:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
and your statement is we are up to 11
 
03:22:16.469 --> 03:22:16.479 align:start position:0%
states presently
 
03:22:19.269 --> 03:22:19.279 align:start position:0%
that is what it says on their website
 
03:22:20.229 --> 03:22:20.239 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:22:22.550 --> 03:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh representative representative marsh
 
03:22:22.560 --> 03:22:23.349 align:start position:0%
uh representative representative marsh
please

03:22:23.349 --> 03:22:23.359 align:start position:0%

yes thank you mr chairman i will point
 
03:22:27.110 --> 03:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
out that people can read the existing
 
03:22:30.550 --> 03:22:30.560 align:start position:0%
contact in the existing rsa 170-a
 
03:22:33.670 --> 03:22:33.680 align:start position:0%
colon one and i would also point out
 
03:22:35.990 --> 03:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
that uh i believe john wade spoke to us
 
03:22:38.550 --> 03:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
earlier he probably can answer the legal
 
03:22:38.560 --> 03:22:39.190 align:start position:0%
earlier he probably can answer the legal
question

03:22:39.190 --> 03:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:22:41.269 --> 03:22:41.279 align:start position:0%
and if not he could quickly get in touch
 
03:22:42.389 --> 03:22:42.399 align:start position:0%
with rebecca ross
 
03:22:44.550 --> 03:22:44.560 align:start position:0%
and certain financial representatives
 
03:22:45.990 --> 03:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
question uh
 
03:22:49.349 --> 03:22:49.359 align:start position:0%
without any villains
 
03:22:51.269 --> 03:22:51.279 align:start position:0%
counselor williams can you speak to this
 
03:22:52.389 --> 03:22:52.399 align:start position:0%

03:22:56.469 --> 03:22:56.479 align:start position:0%
find someone uh chairman uh

ross uh with us and if she could just
 
03:23:00.630 --> 03:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
raise her
 
03:23:02.790 --> 03:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
hand and miss dyer would bring her into
 
03:23:04.790 --> 03:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
the conversation she's at the ready to
 
03:23:06.550 --> 03:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
address the questions regarding the
 
03:23:08.710 --> 03:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
updating of the interstate compact
 
03:23:09.910 --> 03:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
with the house bring her into the
 
03:23:13.830 --> 03:23:13.840 align:start position:0%

03:23:31.110 --> 03:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
 
03:23:34.229 --> 03:23:34.239 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm happy to try to help clarify
 
03:23:36.309 --> 03:23:36.319 align:start position:0%
i believe representative cushman's
 
03:23:38.469 --> 03:23:38.479 align:start position:0%
question is if other states would just
 
03:23:40.790 --> 03:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
be able to take jurisdiction
 
03:23:42.950 --> 03:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
um and keep it in the course of an
 
03:23:45.670 --> 03:23:45.680 align:start position:0%
emergency is that correct
 
03:23:49.190 --> 03:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct i believe
 
03:23:52.550 --> 03:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
the the answer would be no um and
 
03:23:55.510 --> 03:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
part of being a member of the commission
 
03:23:55.520 --> 03:23:56.389 align:start position:0%
part of being a member of the commission
and

03:23:56.389 --> 03:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:23:59.590 --> 03:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
being part of an icpc state is
 
03:24:02.389 --> 03:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
that that would not be able to happen
 
03:24:04.229 --> 03:24:04.239 align:start position:0%
once the 35 states
 
03:24:07.510 --> 03:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
um adopt icpc
 
03:24:11.429 --> 03:24:11.439 align:start position:0%
and or the 2009 version it would
 
03:24:13.269 --> 03:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
um bring together the commission who
 
03:24:14.710 --> 03:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
would sit together and
 
03:24:17.670 --> 03:24:17.680 align:start position:0%
write the essentially the equivalent of
 
03:24:19.910 --> 03:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
the administrative rules on
 
03:24:21.590 --> 03:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
the the nuts and bolts and the mechanics
 
03:24:23.110 --> 03:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
of how all of that would happen
 
03:24:25.670 --> 03:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't happen um like that today
 
03:24:27.510 --> 03:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
under the current icpc and it certainly
 
03:24:28.710 --> 03:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
would not under the
 
03:24:32.070 --> 03:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
continued icpc um the point is to have
 
03:24:34.550 --> 03:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
better collaboration and clarity
 
03:24:37.590 --> 03:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
and communication with the states that
 
03:24:37.600 --> 03:24:37.910 align:start position:0%
and communication with the states that
we

03:24:37.910 --> 03:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:24:40.550 --> 03:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
partner with not um to allow one state
 
03:24:41.990 --> 03:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
to trump the other state
 
03:24:44.870 --> 03:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
and if it were not a dcyf related case
 
03:24:46.469 --> 03:24:46.479 align:start position:0%
and it were another parenting case or
 
03:24:47.830 --> 03:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
other type of case there are other
 
03:24:47.840 --> 03:24:48.309 align:start position:0%
other type of case there are other
things

03:24:48.309 --> 03:24:48.319 align:start position:0%
things
 
03:24:51.750 --> 03:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
like the uniform um custody acts and
 
03:24:54.950 --> 03:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
other acts that we are involved in that
 
03:24:57.269 --> 03:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
would also not permit another state
 
03:24:59.030 --> 03:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
to take jurisdiction over a new
 
03:25:01.030 --> 03:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire child
 
03:25:02.710 --> 03:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
does that address your concern uh
 
03:25:04.150 --> 03:25:04.160 align:start position:0%
representative kushner do you have a
 
03:25:05.110 --> 03:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
follow-up question
 
03:25:07.429 --> 03:25:07.439 align:start position:0%
follow-up question and statement i
 
03:25:07.439 --> 03:25:08.550 align:start position:0%
follow-up question and statement i
suppose

03:25:08.550 --> 03:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
suppose
 
03:25:11.830 --> 03:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
um so there is then in this bill
 
03:25:14.309 --> 03:25:14.319 align:start position:0%
in this section of the bill concerning
 
03:25:15.750 --> 03:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
this content
 
03:25:19.030 --> 03:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
um there is no
 
03:25:21.590 --> 03:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
way to ensure that the state that takes
 
03:25:24.070 --> 03:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
over emergency jurisdiction
 
03:25:26.550 --> 03:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
only maintains it for as long as it
 
03:25:28.309 --> 03:25:28.319 align:start position:0%
takes to get the child back to
 
03:25:31.510 --> 03:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
the ascending state
 
03:25:36.790 --> 03:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
well i think that yes or no question
 
03:25:39.910 --> 03:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
i believe it depends because it would
 
03:25:43.110 --> 03:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
have to do with the rules that are not
 
03:25:43.120 --> 03:25:43.510 align:start position:0%
have to do with the rules that are not
yet

03:25:43.510 --> 03:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
yet
 
03:25:46.870 --> 03:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
written as well as the other facts
 
03:25:49.269 --> 03:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
and circumstances as to why the child
 
03:25:51.110 --> 03:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
was removed so you've asked if we would
 
03:25:51.990 --> 03:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
immediately bring
 
03:25:53.349 --> 03:25:53.359 align:start position:0%
be bringing the child back to new
 
03:25:54.870 --> 03:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire and it really would depend on
 
03:25:57.030 --> 03:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
what type of emergency that was
 
03:25:59.750 --> 03:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
and if the emergency ceased to exist and
 
03:26:01.110 --> 03:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
we determined that it was still an
 
03:26:02.950 --> 03:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate placement with that relative
 
03:26:04.389 --> 03:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
out of state that
 
03:26:06.790 --> 03:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
that child could stay out of state but
 
03:26:08.550 --> 03:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
it would still be a new hampshire case
 
03:26:09.030 --> 03:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
in a
 
03:26:12.229 --> 03:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
new hampshire jurisdiction given the
 
03:26:13.269 --> 03:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
fact that we
 
03:26:16.630 --> 03:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
are under the old compact
 
03:26:19.590 --> 03:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
and presumably the administrative rules
 
03:26:20.229 --> 03:26:20.239 align:start position:0%
for that
 
03:26:22.790 --> 03:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
have been written long ago how would you
 
03:26:25.590 --> 03:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
answer the question
 
03:26:27.269 --> 03:26:27.279 align:start position:0%
right now we would hear from our partner
 
03:26:29.349 --> 03:26:29.359 align:start position:0%
in state who's supervising
 
03:26:32.150 --> 03:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
in the other state and we would work
 
03:26:33.590 --> 03:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
with them to coordinate a plan of
 
03:26:35.269 --> 03:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
whether or not placement in that state
 
03:26:36.870 --> 03:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
was appropriate or if they needed to
 
03:26:38.389 --> 03:26:38.399 align:start position:0%
come back to new hampshire and whether
 
03:26:39.750 --> 03:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
or not a hearing
 
03:26:42.630 --> 03:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
was required or not representative
 
03:26:44.309 --> 03:26:44.319 align:start position:0%
cushman for follow-up
 
03:26:46.870 --> 03:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
mr chairman um so i was looking at the
 
03:26:46.880 --> 03:26:47.429 align:start position:0%
mr chairman um so i was looking at the
current

03:26:47.429 --> 03:26:47.439 align:start position:0%
current
 
03:26:51.030 --> 03:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
statute um and there is no clause
 
03:26:53.510 --> 03:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
to allow jurisdiction to go to the
 
03:26:55.110 --> 03:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
receiving state in
 
03:26:58.630 --> 03:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
an emergency um it only allows them to
 
03:27:00.630 --> 03:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
have jurisdiction over dealing with
 
03:27:02.870 --> 03:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
delinquency or crimes committed in that
 
03:27:02.880 --> 03:27:04.070 align:start position:0%
delinquency or crimes committed in that
state

03:27:04.070 --> 03:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:27:06.150 --> 03:27:06.160 align:start position:0%
um so this is new language so i would
 
03:27:07.190 --> 03:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
assume there are no
 
03:27:09.750 --> 03:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
administrative rules on this particular
 
03:27:09.760 --> 03:27:11.110 align:start position:0%
administrative rules on this particular
topic

03:27:11.110 --> 03:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
topic
 
03:27:12.790 --> 03:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't make that assumption because
 
03:27:14.790 --> 03:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
i don't have the compact rules in front
 
03:27:15.429 --> 03:27:15.439 align:start position:0%
of me
 
03:27:17.990 --> 03:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
um it wouldn't necessarily be expressly
 
03:27:19.990 --> 03:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
in the statute this had not been an
 
03:27:21.349 --> 03:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
issue that had been raised
 
03:27:24.070 --> 03:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
either this session or the last session
 
03:27:25.349 --> 03:27:25.359 align:start position:0%
we could do follow-up
 
03:27:27.190 --> 03:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
research and ask our compact
 
03:27:27.200 --> 03:27:28.630 align:start position:0%
research and ask our compact
administrator

03:27:28.630 --> 03:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
03:27:31.990 --> 03:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
but um in in my 15 years of experience
 
03:27:33.830 --> 03:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
with dcyf this has not been
 
03:27:35.510 --> 03:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
been a concern when we've had an
 
03:27:38.790 --> 03:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
emergency arise with the united states
 
03:27:41.349 --> 03:27:41.359 align:start position:0%
this is the chairman again so it is uh
 
03:27:42.550 --> 03:27:42.560 align:start position:0%
fair to assume
 
03:27:45.670 --> 03:27:45.680 align:start position:0%
if we are doing an analysis of
 
03:27:47.910 --> 03:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
an in a previous iteration of the
 
03:27:47.920 --> 03:27:48.870 align:start position:0%
an in a previous iteration of the
compact

03:27:48.870 --> 03:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
compact
 
03:27:51.190 --> 03:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
we would have to look at both law and
 
03:27:52.870 --> 03:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
administrative rules to get a full
 
03:27:52.880 --> 03:27:55.349 align:start position:0%
administrative rules to get a full
picture

03:27:55.349 --> 03:27:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:58.150 --> 03:27:58.160 align:start position:0%
of all the operational aspects
 
03:27:59.670 --> 03:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely i think that would be
 
03:28:02.469 --> 03:28:02.479 align:start position:0%
for any any law and rule set that we
 
03:28:02.479 --> 03:28:03.030 align:start position:0%
for any any law and rule set that we
have

03:28:03.030 --> 03:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:28:05.349 --> 03:28:05.359 align:start position:0%
um regulating such an important topic
 
03:28:07.429 --> 03:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
yes to follow up on that question
 
03:28:09.349 --> 03:28:09.359 align:start position:0%
would it also be a fair assumption to
 
03:28:11.269 --> 03:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
say if we pass this version
 
03:28:14.309 --> 03:28:14.319 align:start position:0%
the 2009 version what we
 
03:28:17.510 --> 03:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
know is this virgin and what we do not
 
03:28:17.520 --> 03:28:18.229 align:start position:0%
know is this virgin and what we do not
know

03:28:18.229 --> 03:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:28:20.070 --> 03:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
is the administrative rules that are yet
 
03:28:21.830 --> 03:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
to be developed because
 
03:28:24.229 --> 03:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
35 states have not ratified that is that
 
03:28:25.830 --> 03:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
a correct assumption
 
03:28:27.429 --> 03:28:27.439 align:start position:0%
that's correct and we would want to be a
 
03:28:30.309 --> 03:28:30.319 align:start position:0%
part of that so by entering it earlier
 
03:28:32.229 --> 03:28:32.239 align:start position:0%
and joining we would be one of the
 
03:28:33.349 --> 03:28:33.359 align:start position:0%
states at the table
 
03:28:36.150 --> 03:28:36.160 align:start position:0%
to be in those discussions where if we
 
03:28:37.750 --> 03:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
wait and see
 
03:28:38.790 --> 03:28:38.800 align:start position:0%
we don't get a voice in those
 
03:28:40.950 --> 03:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
conversations so we would like to
 
03:28:44.150 --> 03:28:44.160 align:start position:0%
hear of moving forward to a system that
 
03:28:45.910 --> 03:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
has better protections for children
 
03:28:47.429 --> 03:28:47.439 align:start position:0%
coming in and out of
 
03:28:48.950 --> 03:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and that we're able to
 
03:28:50.389 --> 03:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
have a voice at the table when those are
 
03:28:52.229 --> 03:28:52.239 align:start position:0%
being created
 
03:28:53.990 --> 03:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative snob
 
03:28:55.269 --> 03:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
well going back
 
03:28:57.590 --> 03:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
to the psychologist bill that my
 
03:28:58.870 --> 03:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
colleague mentioned
 
03:29:00.790 --> 03:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
that we looked at compact around
 
03:29:02.389 --> 03:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
psychologists being able to
 
03:29:06.710 --> 03:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
work in other states in emergencies
 
03:29:09.830 --> 03:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
the only people who can set up rules for
 
03:29:11.349 --> 03:29:11.359 align:start position:0%
that compact are the people who have
 
03:29:12.389 --> 03:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
already joined
 
03:29:15.110 --> 03:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
right and that continues there are now
 
03:29:17.830 --> 03:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
11 people who are going to be making any
 
03:29:19.670 --> 03:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
decisions about that it moves a little
 
03:29:21.190 --> 03:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
bit that's a fact that we ought to keep
 
03:29:21.910 --> 03:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
in mind

um i don't feel comfortable having
 
03:30:25.830 --> 03:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
you know the multiple states and an
 
03:30:27.830 --> 03:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
interesting compact make the rule that
 
03:30:27.840 --> 03:30:28.389 align:start position:0%
interesting compact make the rule that
we

03:30:28.389 --> 03:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:30:31.190 --> 03:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
maintain jurisdiction over a child if
 
03:30:31.200 --> 03:30:32.630 align:start position:0%
maintain jurisdiction over a child if
they're

03:30:32.630 --> 03:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
they're
 
03:30:35.110 --> 03:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
if the receiving state takes that in an
 
03:30:35.120 --> 03:30:36.630 align:start position:0%
if the receiving state takes that in an
emergency

03:30:36.630 --> 03:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
03:30:40.630 --> 03:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
um i that i can't support
 
03:30:43.910 --> 03:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
this bill i would support if
 
03:30:46.070 --> 03:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
there was language in there that said
 
03:30:48.150 --> 03:30:48.160 align:start position:0%
you know they can take jurisdiction in
 
03:30:49.030 --> 03:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
an emergency
 
03:30:51.990 --> 03:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
for you know as long as it takes to get
 
03:30:52.710 --> 03:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
the child
 
03:30:56.630 --> 03:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
back to either the sending state or
 
03:30:58.469 --> 03:30:58.479 align:start position:0%
to get in contact with the sending state
 
03:30:59.910 --> 03:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
and for them to come in
 
03:31:03.750 --> 03:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
and you know take over the case
 
03:31:06.309 --> 03:31:06.319 align:start position:0%
representative marsh yes i would like to
 
03:31:07.910 --> 03:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
point out that pursuant to amendment
 
03:31:07.920 --> 03:31:08.790 align:start position:0%
point out that pursuant to amendment
1402

03:31:08.790 --> 03:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
1402
 
03:31:11.429 --> 03:31:11.439 align:start position:0%
h that we just passed these people out
 
03:31:13.190 --> 03:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
of state do not decorate the rules for
 
03:31:14.710 --> 03:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire
 
03:31:17.110 --> 03:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
they go through our normal remaking
 
03:31:17.120 --> 03:31:18.150 align:start position:0%
they go through our normal remaking
process

03:31:18.150 --> 03:31:18.160 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:31:21.030 --> 03:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
representative mars the chair would ask
 
03:31:22.870 --> 03:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
i i am familiar with some
 
03:31:26.070 --> 03:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
interstate compacts and they are written
 
03:31:27.990 --> 03:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
in that the local state does not have
 
03:31:30.550 --> 03:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
the right to write its own rules but
 
03:31:33.590 --> 03:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
must abide by the joint rules would the
 
03:31:33.600 --> 03:31:34.790 align:start position:0%
must abide by the joint rules would the
amendments

03:31:34.790 --> 03:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
03:31:37.030 --> 03:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
that refer that reserves to new
 
03:31:38.790 --> 03:31:38.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire the right to write
 
03:31:41.670 --> 03:31:41.680 align:start position:0%
the rules invalidate our participation
 
03:31:42.710 --> 03:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
in the compact
 
03:31:45.910 --> 03:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh mr chair what we did is we copied the
 
03:31:49.030 --> 03:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
current statute and put the references
 
03:31:50.070 --> 03:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
to the contact
 
03:31:53.110 --> 03:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
in the new compact in that section of
 
03:31:54.070 --> 03:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
the village
 
03:31:55.510 --> 03:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
if you have i'll give you a vacation
 
03:31:57.429 --> 03:31:57.439 align:start position:0%
line through any piece of paper because
 
03:31:58.070 --> 03:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
i don't have
 
03:32:02.070 --> 03:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:04.950 --> 03:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
because i as i said i do know and one
 
03:32:06.389 --> 03:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
that i've been working on
 
03:32:21.590 --> 03:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:23.670 --> 03:32:23.680 align:start position:0%
uh i know in some compacts we're not
 
03:32:25.830 --> 03:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
allowed to do that yes uh page two
 
03:32:27.910 --> 03:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
lines fifteen to sixteen of your
 
03:32:29.750 --> 03:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
amendments of the amendment parallels
 
03:32:31.110 --> 03:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
the existing language
 
03:32:34.309 --> 03:32:34.319 align:start position:0%
in the existing rsa 170 page seven
 
03:32:38.389 --> 03:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
and allocates human services shall adopt
 
03:32:38.399 --> 03:32:39.510 align:start position:0%
and allocates human services shall adopt
rules

03:32:39.510 --> 03:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
rules
 
03:32:41.590 --> 03:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
under article 11 of the contract in
 
03:32:43.830 --> 03:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
accordance with rsa 541
 
03:32:44.950 --> 03:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
so i believe that is the correct
 
03:32:47.349 --> 03:32:47.359 align:start position:0%
procedure and it parallels the existing
 
03:32:50.070 --> 03:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
language and statute
 
03:32:53.349 --> 03:32:53.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um that just simply
 
03:32:55.429 --> 03:32:55.439 align:start position:0%
means we have to make sure that
 
03:32:58.630 --> 03:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
the rules in this state are written
 
03:33:01.670 --> 03:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
to allow that but they're not in
 
03:33:05.750 --> 03:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
the bill right right
 
03:33:09.030 --> 03:33:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:10.870 --> 03:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
anyone else want to go to law school
 
03:33:17.429 --> 03:33:17.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:22.630 --> 03:33:22.640 align:start position:0%
i feel like i'm auditing it's pass fail
 
03:33:25.750 --> 03:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh we are actually on the entire all
 
03:33:29.429 --> 03:33:29.439 align:start position:0%
focus pages of the bill and not just on
 
03:33:31.510 --> 03:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
this particular section on interstate
 
03:33:31.520 --> 03:33:32.550 align:start position:0%
this particular section on interstate
compact

03:33:32.550 --> 03:33:32.560 align:start position:0%
compact
 
03:33:35.750 --> 03:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
so any questions or comments on
 
03:33:38.950 --> 03:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
sb 162 as amended
 
03:33:47.269 --> 03:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
as a whole
 
03:33:49.190 --> 03:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming we can't make comments
 
03:33:51.030 --> 03:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
about the other chamber
 
03:33:53.590 --> 03:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
uh you can make comments about the other
 
03:33:53.600 --> 03:33:54.710 align:start position:0%
uh you can make comments about the other
chamber

03:33:54.710 --> 03:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
chamber
 
03:33:58.550 --> 03:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
but in a way that does not wink wink
 
03:34:02.550 --> 03:34:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:05.510 --> 03:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
so i can say i hope we never get a bill
 
03:34:08.550 --> 03:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
before us with 72 parts again
 
03:34:12.150 --> 03:34:12.160 align:start position:0%
because it was confusing is that polite
 
03:34:12.160 --> 03:34:13.190 align:start position:0%
because it was confusing is that polite
enough

03:34:13.190 --> 03:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
enough
 
03:34:14.870 --> 03:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
actually i would go with something more
 
03:34:17.990 --> 03:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
impolite but i'll take that okay
 
03:34:21.349 --> 03:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
you're here out there um
 
03:34:23.349 --> 03:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
and just remember they are the junior
 
03:34:25.510 --> 03:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
body because we had a speaker of the
 
03:34:27.990 --> 03:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
house in 1684.
 
03:34:31.030 --> 03:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
and the senate didn't show up until much
 
03:34:35.510 --> 03:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
later just a fact representative gay
 
03:34:39.349 --> 03:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
what authority do we have to tell
 
03:34:43.030 --> 03:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
the other body yeah that there's a limit
 
03:34:46.150 --> 03:34:46.160 align:start position:0%
on how many items should be in a bill
 
03:34:49.190 --> 03:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
i mean the only one i can know is okay
 
03:34:51.190 --> 03:34:51.200 align:start position:0%
i've heard some people say this just
 
03:34:51.200 --> 03:34:52.229 align:start position:0%
i've heard some people say this just
ideal

03:34:52.229 --> 03:34:52.239 align:start position:0%
ideal
 
03:34:55.110 --> 03:34:55.120 align:start position:0%
they won't do it anymore but all we can
 
03:34:56.070 --> 03:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
do to be polite
 
03:35:00.229 --> 03:35:00.239 align:start position:0%
is x out sections but it's just too hard
 
03:35:03.349 --> 03:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
representative weber we don't have any
 
03:35:05.349 --> 03:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
authority to tell them what to do just
 
03:35:07.110 --> 03:35:07.120 align:start position:0%
as they don't have any authority to tell
 
03:35:08.229 --> 03:35:08.239 align:start position:0%
us what to do
 
03:35:11.830 --> 03:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
but i will say that uh
 
03:35:15.110 --> 03:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
this is happening because
 
03:35:19.190 --> 03:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
of the covet emergency and
 
03:35:22.150 --> 03:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
believe me there are many people in both
 
03:35:24.229 --> 03:35:24.239 align:start position:0%
parties that deplore
 
03:35:26.710 --> 03:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
the putting of bills together and mr
 
03:35:29.269 --> 03:35:29.279 align:start position:0%
williams will testify that when i cha
 
03:35:33.190 --> 03:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
chaired this committee i had a number of
 
03:35:35.510 --> 03:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
conversations with him about
 
03:35:38.870 --> 03:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
not lumping things in together no matter
 
03:35:41.590 --> 03:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
how non-controversial they seem to begin
 
03:35:41.600 --> 03:35:42.229 align:start position:0%
how non-controversial they seem to begin
with

03:35:42.229 --> 03:35:42.239 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:35:44.950 --> 03:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
because people particularly people in
 
03:35:45.510 --> 03:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
the house
 
03:35:47.990 --> 03:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
want to take a look at them separately
 
03:35:48.550 --> 03:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
and judge
 
03:35:52.550 --> 03:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
each one on their own merits so um i
 
03:35:55.110 --> 03:35:55.120 align:start position:0%
i think that there's a huge amount of
 
03:35:55.120 --> 03:35:56.309 align:start position:0%
i think that there's a huge amount of
sentiment

03:35:56.309 --> 03:35:56.319 align:start position:0%
sentiment
 
03:36:00.550 --> 03:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
in that direction and uh we can only
 
03:36:02.870 --> 03:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
talk to our colleagues on the other side
 
03:36:03.990 --> 03:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
of the wall and
 
03:36:06.710 --> 03:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
and ask them to go along with that but
 
03:36:08.790 --> 03:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
these are extraordinary times and
 
03:36:12.070 --> 03:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
and more often things are more broken
 
03:36:12.080 --> 03:36:12.790 align:start position:0%
and more often things are more broken
down

03:36:12.790 --> 03:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
down
 
03:36:16.550 --> 03:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
um but it's a concern the one recourse
 
03:36:19.990 --> 03:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
that we have is simply to itl large
 
03:36:22.550 --> 03:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
bills the difficulty in that is some
 
03:36:23.830 --> 03:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
very good bills die
 
03:36:28.790 --> 03:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:31.910 --> 03:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
and having been widowed that way once or
 
03:36:31.920 --> 03:36:36.309 align:start position:0%
and having been widowed that way once or
twice

03:36:36.309 --> 03:36:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:39.910 --> 03:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:43.349 --> 03:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
i think where the conversation is both
 
03:36:43.359 --> 03:36:43.990 align:start position:0%
i think where the conversation is both
wise

03:36:43.990 --> 03:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
wise
 
03:36:47.910 --> 03:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
and be wise not to do it on open mics
 
03:36:47.920 --> 03:36:49.910 align:start position:0%
and be wise not to do it on open mics
yeah

03:36:49.910 --> 03:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:36:51.990 --> 03:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
it's also more difficult than a larger
 
03:36:52.000 --> 03:36:57.510 align:start position:0%
it's also more difficult than a larger
body

03:36:57.510 --> 03:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:01.030 --> 03:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
any other any other comments on sb 162
 
03:37:04.070 --> 03:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
as amended
 
03:37:05.429 --> 03:37:05.439 align:start position:0%
this is going to lead to a conference
 
03:37:07.910 --> 03:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
committee okay
 
03:37:10.229 --> 03:37:10.239 align:start position:0%
well we've got amendments in it there
 
03:37:11.030 --> 03:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
could yeah
 
03:37:14.630 --> 03:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
and that's an opportunity to make some
 
03:37:17.349 --> 03:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
statements about that assuming one of us
 
03:37:19.429 --> 03:37:19.439 align:start position:0%
is on the conference committee
 
03:37:21.990 --> 03:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
that's the representative marsh yes i
 
03:37:24.070 --> 03:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
spoke to the prime sponsor this morning
 
03:37:25.830 --> 03:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
and if we pass this bill with our
 
03:37:27.349 --> 03:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
amendment 1402 h
 
03:37:32.389 --> 03:37:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:35.830 --> 03:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
however if i assume
 
03:37:39.190 --> 03:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
there is the theoretical possibility
 
03:37:41.269 --> 03:37:41.279 align:start position:0%
that there's a snarky floor amendment
 
03:37:44.309 --> 03:37:44.319 align:start position:0%
that pulls out something that would have
 
03:37:44.950 --> 03:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
to pass
 
03:37:47.910 --> 03:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
and then um it would be assumed that the
 
03:37:49.910 --> 03:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
senate would
 
03:37:52.710 --> 03:37:52.720 align:start position:0%
probably not agree and then we would go
 
03:37:54.389 --> 03:37:54.399 align:start position:0%
to a conference committee and
 
03:37:56.950 --> 03:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
that would be different that would be
 
03:37:58.309 --> 03:37:58.319 align:start position:0%
good crazy would break loose
 
03:37:59.910 --> 03:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
03:38:01.830 --> 03:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
but the conference committee by our
 
03:38:03.990 --> 03:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
rules is only allowed to consider
 
03:38:06.550 --> 03:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
matters that are in either the senate
 
03:38:09.030 --> 03:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
version or the house version of the bill
 
03:38:11.750 --> 03:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
so it does not open everything up to
 
03:38:11.760 --> 03:38:12.670 align:start position:0%
so it does not open everything up to
re-discuss

03:38:12.670 --> 03:38:12.680 align:start position:0%
re-discuss
 
03:38:15.990 --> 03:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
renegotiation my question my theoretical
 
03:38:16.000 --> 03:38:17.429 align:start position:0%
renegotiation my question my theoretical
was

03:38:17.429 --> 03:38:17.439 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:38:20.469 --> 03:38:20.479 align:start position:0%
in the middle obviously but you can't
 
03:38:20.479 --> 03:38:20.950 align:start position:0%
in the middle obviously but you can't
start

03:38:20.950 --> 03:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
start
 
03:38:23.590 --> 03:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
bringing other stuff in um my
 
03:38:25.030 --> 03:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
theoretical was
 
03:38:27.910 --> 03:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
we would have a an amendment a hostile
 
03:38:27.920 --> 03:38:28.550 align:start position:0%
we would have a an amendment a hostile
amendment

03:38:28.550 --> 03:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:38:30.630 --> 03:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
on the floor that would strip out a
 
03:38:33.110 --> 03:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
section that we didn't like
 
03:38:35.750 --> 03:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
and then that pare down version let's
 
03:38:37.030 --> 03:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
say it's passed
 
03:38:39.510 --> 03:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
the senate does not like it and could
 
03:38:39.520 --> 03:38:40.309 align:start position:0%
the senate does not like it and could
request

03:38:40.309 --> 03:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
request
 
03:38:41.990 --> 03:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
a committee of conference i'm not
 
03:38:43.349 --> 03:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
advocating for that
 
03:38:49.030 --> 03:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:54.950 --> 03:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not asking you to do that
 
03:38:57.110 --> 03:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
any other any other comments on the bill
 
03:39:01.030 --> 03:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:04.229 --> 03:39:04.239 align:start position:0%
vote on it uh
 
03:39:07.990 --> 03:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
seeing nothing in the amendment right
 
03:39:10.870 --> 03:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
seeing none the bill before us is senate

two who voted in the negative
 
03:40:59.750 --> 03:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
may confer on which will write the

minority report
 
03:41:04.630 --> 03:41:04.640 align:start position:0%
and as the last time please get that to

03:41:05.510 --> 03:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
me
 
03:41:07.910 --> 03:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
as soon as you can because they're
 
03:41:09.269 --> 03:41:09.279 align:start position:0%
really asking for
 
03:41:12.710 --> 03:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
as much as we can send them um
 
03:41:14.710 --> 03:41:14.720 align:start position:0%
as soon as we can send it to them
 
03:41:16.070 --> 03:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
because we've got
 
03:41:19.349 --> 03:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
a voting session coming up soon so this
 
03:41:23.910 --> 03:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
ends the executive session
 
03:41:28.070 --> 03:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
on senate bill 162.
 
03:41:31.429 --> 03:41:31.439 align:start position:0%
and this actually ends our
 
03:41:35.590 --> 03:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
work for now mr representative
 
03:41:39.110 --> 03:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
i just may have redwater
 
03:41:40.870 --> 03:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
but there's a recent supreme court
 
03:41:43.349 --> 03:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
decision on what's called the jane doe
 
03:41:45.510 --> 03:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
case are you all familiar with that
 
03:41:48.630 --> 03:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
it's going to have some kind of
 
03:41:50.790 --> 03:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
immediate effects the jane doe case was
 
03:41:53.269 --> 03:41:53.279 align:start position:0%
one in which
 
03:41:57.110 --> 03:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
a case was taken to court a patient
 
03:42:01.030 --> 03:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
who was taken to the emergency room at
 
03:42:03.110 --> 03:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
mary hitchcock hospital and this happens
 
03:42:04.469 --> 03:42:04.479 align:start position:0%
all around the state
 
03:42:06.870 --> 03:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
it's taken to mary hitchcock hospital
 
03:42:08.870 --> 03:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
and sat there for 17 days
 
03:42:11.910 --> 03:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
awaiting the opening of a hospital bed
 
03:42:14.950 --> 03:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:17.189 --> 03:42:17.199 align:start position:0%
last night there was 30 adults and 20
 
03:42:18.150 --> 03:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
children waiting
 
03:42:21.269 --> 03:42:21.279 align:start position:0%
in different words and that's done with
 
03:42:21.279 --> 03:42:21.750 align:start position:0%
in different words and that's done with
no

03:42:21.750 --> 03:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:42:24.790 --> 03:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
probable cause here which by law
 
03:42:27.830 --> 03:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
is required to be made available for the
 
03:42:30.950 --> 03:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
patient within three days
 
03:42:35.429 --> 03:42:35.439 align:start position:0%
detained current practice has been
 
03:42:37.590 --> 03:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
to say well the tension doesn't stop
 
03:42:38.469 --> 03:42:38.479 align:start position:0%
until we're
 
03:42:41.110 --> 03:42:41.120 align:start position:0%
transferring in the state hospital or
 
03:42:44.229 --> 03:42:44.239 align:start position:0%
another designated receiver
 
03:42:47.349 --> 03:42:47.359 align:start position:0%
the supreme court has said no the person
 
03:42:48.710 --> 03:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
needs to be
 
03:42:51.349 --> 03:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
more immediately transferred right away
 
03:42:52.950 --> 03:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
to another facility
 
03:42:56.309 --> 03:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
or at least to have that probable cause
 
03:42:56.319 --> 03:42:56.950 align:start position:0%
or at least to have that probable cause
here

03:42:56.950 --> 03:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:42:58.870 --> 03:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
to be held in the hospital which makes
 
03:43:01.189 --> 03:43:01.199 align:start position:0%
sense the hospital association and
 
03:43:02.870 --> 03:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
everybody else are absolutely against
 
03:43:04.150 --> 03:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
the idea of having
 
03:43:07.189 --> 03:43:07.199 align:start position:0%
probable cause here and uh they're doing
 
03:43:07.990 --> 03:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
a math
 
03:43:09.830 --> 03:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
i think the hospitals have to deserve a
 
03:43:11.590 --> 03:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
medal of honor or what they've had to
 
03:43:13.590 --> 03:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
put up with their emergency room
 
03:43:16.389 --> 03:43:16.399 align:start position:0%
someone constructed yellow beds like
 
03:43:18.710 --> 03:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
concrete hospital did and others but
 
03:43:20.550 --> 03:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a huge problem but they need
 
03:43:21.750 --> 03:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
to do it the governor
 
03:43:24.469 --> 03:43:24.479 align:start position:0%
had a press conference earlier this week
 
03:43:25.670 --> 03:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
if he said well
 
03:43:28.229 --> 03:43:28.239 align:start position:0%
he is going to he didn't say emergency
 
03:43:29.670 --> 03:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
but he said he's going to do something
 
03:43:30.550 --> 03:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
right away
 
03:43:32.150 --> 03:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
to make sure this doesn't happen and
 
03:43:35.030 --> 03:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
imply that what we need to do is expand
 
03:43:37.030 --> 03:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
the number of hospital events that are
 
03:43:37.040 --> 03:43:38.469 align:start position:0%
the number of hospital events that are
available

03:43:38.469 --> 03:43:38.479 align:start position:0%
available
 
03:43:40.630 --> 03:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
i had a conversation just prior to all
 
03:43:42.630 --> 03:43:42.640 align:start position:0%
this with lou d'alessandro who's head of
 
03:43:43.830 --> 03:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
the finance committee
 
03:43:46.389 --> 03:43:46.399 align:start position:0%
and he's dead set against seeing any
 
03:43:47.670 --> 03:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
more hospital events
 
03:43:50.389 --> 03:43:50.399 align:start position:0%
his statement was when i started working
 
03:43:52.150 --> 03:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
on this there were three thousand people
 
03:43:53.910 --> 03:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
at the age of hospital
 
03:43:56.150 --> 03:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
i don't want to even make any steps back
 
03:43:57.429 --> 03:43:57.439 align:start position:0%
in the direction
 
03:44:00.830 --> 03:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
of seeing another city packed up with
 
03:44:00.840 --> 03:44:01.990 align:start position:0%
of seeing another city packed up with
hillary

03:44:01.990 --> 03:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
hillary
 
03:44:04.229 --> 03:44:04.239 align:start position:0%
somewhere in between some solution is
 
03:44:06.070 --> 03:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
going to come down and a lot of the
 
03:44:08.229 --> 03:44:08.239 align:start position:0%
decision making is going to be i think
 
03:44:09.830 --> 03:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
geared towards this committee
 
03:44:11.750 --> 03:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
so we need to start to think about how
 
03:44:13.429 --> 03:44:13.439 align:start position:0%
we're going to respond
 
03:44:15.110 --> 03:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
to what decisions are getting made
 
03:44:16.630 --> 03:44:16.640 align:start position:0%
around the state
 
03:44:19.910 --> 03:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
i am i don't have a foggiest idea what
 
03:44:21.750 --> 03:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
the best recommendation is
 
03:44:23.750 --> 03:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
but quite clearly just expanding
 
03:44:26.070 --> 03:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
hospital beds is not the answer
 
03:44:27.830 --> 03:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
we already knew from a previous
 
03:44:30.070 --> 03:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
commission that i served on with
 
03:44:32.550 --> 03:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
where commissioner came in and said one
 
03:44:34.469 --> 03:44:34.479 align:start position:0%
of the big problems isn't just
 
03:44:38.550 --> 03:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
the front door but also the back door
 
03:44:42.550 --> 03:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
yeah we need to really focus on
 
03:44:44.630 --> 03:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
easily they've taken some steps they
 
03:44:47.030 --> 03:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
took the old fieldwork center
 
03:44:50.469 --> 03:44:50.479 align:start position:0%
and converted that to transitional house
 
03:44:53.830 --> 03:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
16 beds only the
 
03:44:56.550 --> 03:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
fact of the matter is the responsibility
 
03:44:58.070 --> 03:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
ultimately is going to follow a mental
 
03:44:59.510 --> 03:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
health system
 
03:45:01.750 --> 03:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
that is currently grossly underfunded
 
03:45:04.150 --> 03:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
and severely understaffed
 
03:45:07.349 --> 03:45:07.359 align:start position:0%
and you know a lot of them would like to
 
03:45:07.359 --> 03:45:07.750 align:start position:0%
and you know a lot of them would like to
open

03:45:07.750 --> 03:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
open
 
03:45:11.429 --> 03:45:11.439 align:start position:0%
more traditional housing
 
03:45:13.510 --> 03:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
but the formulas used by the state of
 
03:45:15.189 --> 03:45:15.199 align:start position:0%
new hampshire to fund those
 
03:45:17.910 --> 03:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
means you agreed to take on a lot of
 
03:45:17.920 --> 03:45:19.510 align:start position:0%
means you agreed to take on a lot of
responsibility

03:45:19.510 --> 03:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
03:45:25.900 --> 03:45:25.910 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:25.910 --> 03:45:30.870 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:45:30.870 --> 03:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:32.550 --> 03:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
so i just bring it up i mean it's not
 
03:45:34.469 --> 03:45:34.479 align:start position:0%
exactly great news for everybody but the
 
03:45:34.479 --> 03:45:35.030 align:start position:0%
exactly great news for everybody but the
lawsuit

03:45:35.030 --> 03:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
lawsuit
 
03:45:38.309 --> 03:45:38.319 align:start position:0%
has come in the governor has been on the
 
03:45:40.550 --> 03:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
press conference to make an announcement
 
03:45:41.990 --> 03:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know what's going to happen i'm
 
03:45:42.000 --> 03:45:42.389 align:start position:0%
i don't know what's going to happen i'm
sure

03:45:42.389 --> 03:45:42.399 align:start position:0%
sure
 
03:45:46.309 --> 03:45:46.319 align:start position:0%
before murray chevinette who's had to
 
03:45:48.950 --> 03:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
sharpen us through this crisis he's
 
03:45:48.960 --> 03:45:49.510 align:start position:0%
sharpen us through this crisis he's
probably

03:45:49.510 --> 03:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
probably
 
03:45:52.630 --> 03:45:52.640 align:start position:0%
about to tear apparel well
 
03:45:54.630 --> 03:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
no i the only good thing about it is
 
03:45:56.950 --> 03:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
poor laurie i don't think has
 
03:45:59.510 --> 03:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
been in their new office up at the brown
 
03:45:59.520 --> 03:46:00.630 align:start position:0%
been in their new office up at the brown
building

03:46:00.630 --> 03:46:00.640 align:start position:0%
building
 
03:46:02.309 --> 03:46:02.319 align:start position:0%
since she took office and i think she's
 
03:46:04.710 --> 03:46:04.720 align:start position:0%
spending all her time over with
 
03:46:07.030 --> 03:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
the crisis center maybe she'll have to
 
03:46:08.710 --> 03:46:08.720 align:start position:0%
introduce yourself to a new office to
 
03:46:10.469 --> 03:46:10.479 align:start position:0%
begin to deal with this
 
03:46:13.510 --> 03:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
but i really am concerned that
 
03:46:15.110 --> 03:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
you knocked it off in the wrong floor to
 
03:46:17.269 --> 03:46:17.279 align:start position:0%
head off in the wrong direction
 
03:46:19.429 --> 03:46:19.439 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of people here they'll
 
03:46:21.110 --> 03:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
already be
 
03:46:24.950 --> 03:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
you have no idea to be very very
 
03:46:28.150 --> 03:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
disturbed quite sick
 
03:46:30.070 --> 03:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
and to be quarantined in an emergency
 
03:46:32.790 --> 03:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
room two or three days
 
03:46:35.110 --> 03:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
two or three weeks or even longer in
 
03:46:36.710 --> 03:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
some cases
 
03:46:38.150 --> 03:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
with all the other happenings that are
 
03:46:40.229 --> 03:46:40.239 align:start position:0%
going on seeing people come in
 
03:46:42.389 --> 03:46:42.399 align:start position:0%
to drug overdoses people coming into
 
03:46:43.750 --> 03:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
severe accidents
 
03:46:45.750 --> 03:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're parked in the halls
 
03:46:47.189 --> 03:46:47.199 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're parked in another
 
03:46:48.630 --> 03:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
building there's very little
 
03:46:50.389 --> 03:46:50.399 align:start position:0%
treatment it said except to give them
 
03:46:52.389 --> 03:46:52.399 align:start position:0%
sit me down medicine
 
03:46:57.830 --> 03:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:00.150 --> 03:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
somebody that worked with adults and
 
03:47:02.070 --> 03:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
kids in the mental health system for
 
03:47:06.150 --> 03:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
50 years extremely painful to me to just
 
03:47:07.189 --> 03:47:07.199 align:start position:0%
think that that
 
03:47:10.469 --> 03:47:10.479 align:start position:0%
is a possibility in 2012
 
03:47:12.309 --> 03:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
up until that day and i was i've been in
 
03:47:13.750 --> 03:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
the system a long time right now
 
03:47:17.269 --> 03:47:17.279 align:start position:0%
we never had anybody elderly we always
 
03:47:18.550 --> 03:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
had room to put them
 
03:47:22.309 --> 03:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:24.389 --> 03:47:24.399 align:start position:0%
maybe they had to be held overnight but
 
03:47:26.550 --> 03:47:26.560 align:start position:0%
they did however
 
03:47:28.229 --> 03:47:28.239 align:start position:0%
i remember the first call that went out
 
03:47:30.309 --> 03:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
says we have somebody sitting at
 
03:47:32.950 --> 03:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
such a hospital we have new beds
 
03:47:32.960 --> 03:47:34.070 align:start position:0%
such a hospital we have new beds
anywhere

03:47:34.070 --> 03:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
anywhere
 
03:47:37.510 --> 03:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
and everybody was really upset nowadays
 
03:47:39.830 --> 03:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
nobody's upset
 
03:47:42.870 --> 03:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
we got the 40 50 and nobody
 
03:47:45.990 --> 03:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
let's hope that we act on this supreme
 
03:47:48.309 --> 03:47:48.319 align:start position:0%
court with a responsible way to do
 
03:47:48.319 --> 03:47:49.990 align:start position:0%
court with a responsible way to do
something

03:47:49.990 --> 03:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
something
 
03:47:51.990 --> 03:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
representative snow when i was growing
 
03:47:54.550 --> 03:47:54.560 align:start position:0%
up in massachusetts massachusetts
 
03:47:57.189 --> 03:47:57.199 align:start position:0%
has been recognized as one of the
 
03:47:57.199 --> 03:47:58.150 align:start position:0%
has been recognized as one of the
pioneers

03:47:58.150 --> 03:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
pioneers
 
03:48:00.710 --> 03:48:00.720 align:start position:0%
in building the mental health facilities
 
03:48:02.469 --> 03:48:02.479 align:start position:0%
in the 19th century
 
03:48:04.630 --> 03:48:04.640 align:start position:0%
then we realized that well intended as
 
03:48:05.830 --> 03:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
it was
 
03:48:08.870 --> 03:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
we over incarcerated the people and i
 
03:48:10.630 --> 03:48:10.640 align:start position:0%
used that term deliberately
 
03:48:13.030 --> 03:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
so then there was a move to shut many of
 
03:48:15.110 --> 03:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
the facilities danvers and
 
03:48:16.710 --> 03:48:16.720 align:start position:0%
gardner and you know all over the state
 
03:48:18.150 --> 03:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
of mount bridgewater all over the state
 
03:48:19.189 --> 03:48:19.199 align:start position:0%
of massachusetts
 
03:48:21.110 --> 03:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
because the halfway houses would be
 
03:48:23.429 --> 03:48:23.439 align:start position:0%
built they weren't built
 
03:48:25.510 --> 03:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
so instead of now calling these people
 
03:48:25.520 --> 03:48:26.630 align:start position:0%
so instead of now calling these people
patients

03:48:26.630 --> 03:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
patients
 
03:48:29.750 --> 03:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
they're now called street people or
 
03:48:30.870 --> 03:48:30.880 align:start position:0%
their overflow
 
03:48:32.950 --> 03:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
in a hospital and you may be
 
03:48:34.790 --> 03:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
particularly interested to know that
 
03:48:37.030 --> 03:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
when i went to visit a parishioner
 
03:48:39.670 --> 03:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
in the emergency room i was grabbed by
 
03:48:39.680 --> 03:48:40.070 align:start position:0%
in the emergency room i was grabbed by
the

03:48:40.070 --> 03:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:48:43.110 --> 03:48:43.120 align:start position:0%
unit head and said father would you
 
03:48:43.120 --> 03:48:43.590 align:start position:0%
unit head and said father would you
please

03:48:43.590 --> 03:48:43.600 align:start position:0%
please
 
03:48:45.590 --> 03:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
visit a couple of people they were in
 
03:48:47.590 --> 03:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
the hall they were overflow
 
03:48:49.510 --> 03:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
waiting and i said thinking of my
 
03:48:51.030 --> 03:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
encounter with you i better take my
 
03:48:52.790 --> 03:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
clerical collar off first i don't want
 
03:48:53.830 --> 03:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
to split them
 
03:48:57.110 --> 03:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
so a sort of semi-dressed i wound up
 
03:48:59.110 --> 03:48:59.120 align:start position:0%
spending several hours
 
03:49:02.150 --> 03:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
being an emergency counselor
 
03:49:05.269 --> 03:49:05.279 align:start position:0%
in an emergency room because there was
 
03:49:07.830 --> 03:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
nowhere to put these people so i've been
 
03:49:08.550 --> 03:49:08.560 align:start position:0%
through this
 
03:49:11.910 --> 03:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
and yes and
 
03:49:14.389 --> 03:49:14.399 align:start position:0%
amen to everything that you have said
 
03:49:16.790 --> 03:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
and that you've long advocated for
 
03:49:19.030 --> 03:49:19.040 align:start position:0%

03:49:20.150 --> 03:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
d'alessandro
 
03:49:22.710 --> 03:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
in going back to the way we were but we
 
03:49:23.990 --> 03:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
cannot stay where we
 
03:49:30.229 --> 03:49:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:33.269 --> 03:49:33.279 align:start position:0%
ken and i intend to activate the
 
03:49:36.790 --> 03:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
mental health caucus to bring attention
 
03:49:39.830 --> 03:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
to this for the entire
 
03:49:43.510 --> 03:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh legislation we did this
 
03:49:46.790 --> 03:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
in the last session and it was
 
03:49:49.910 --> 03:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
very successful it's heartbreaking
 
03:49:52.710 --> 03:49:52.720 align:start position:0%
that all of the things that we
 
03:49:55.990 --> 03:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
accomplished seem to have gone to hell
 
03:49:58.150 --> 03:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
so that those of you that are interested
 
03:50:02.710 --> 03:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:05.269 --> 03:50:05.279 align:start position:0%
the reason we're not moving too fast
 
03:50:06.309 --> 03:50:06.319 align:start position:0%
just to figure out
 
03:50:09.429 --> 03:50:09.439 align:start position:0%
where to meet so i think maybe
 
03:50:12.950 --> 03:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
shortly we'll get to go ahead to
 
03:50:16.309 --> 03:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh to go ahead and meet
 
03:50:20.630 --> 03:50:20.640 align:start position:0%

03:50:23.830 --> 03:50:23.840 align:start position:0%

03:50:26.229 --> 03:50:26.239 align:start position:0%
