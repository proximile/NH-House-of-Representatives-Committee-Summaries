you oh okay I thought red was bad okay
 
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:43.240 align:start position:0%
sorry uh I have been watching your
 
00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:45.479 align:start position:0%
subcommittee every moment for the last
 
00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
six months from from afar so it's good
 
00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
to be here and see you all in person uh
 
00:07:54.749 --> 00:07:54.759 align:start position:0%
Adam finle I live in Dalton um uh most
 
00:07:56.189 --> 00:07:56.199 align:start position:0%
of the year I have an unheated place so
 
00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
I live in Princeton New Jersey part of
 
00:07:59.710 --> 00:07:59.720 align:start position:0%
the year and I really appreciate the
 
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
chance to come and talk uh to the
 
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee about how regulations are
 
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
written vetted
 
00:08:10.749 --> 00:08:10.759 align:start position:0%
prioritized proposed implemented
 
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
defended enacted and enforced in most of
 
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
the country and most of the world now I
 
00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:19.400 align:start position:0%
love New Hampshire I worked here in the
 
00:08:21.589 --> 00:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
80s uh on Mount Washington been trying
 
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
to get back here for all that time and
 
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
it's an exceptional State uh and it
 
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:28.280 align:start position:0%
should remain that way but it is it is
 
00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
an outlier with respect to the
 
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
administrative State and so I'm hoping
 
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
to start a I think a a needed but long
 
00:08:38.589 --> 00:08:38.599 align:start position:0%
conversation about how to modernize the
 
00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
way regulations are done in this state
 
00:08:43.389 --> 00:08:43.399 align:start position:0%
picking some of the good features of
 
00:08:45.949 --> 00:08:45.959 align:start position:0%
other jurisdictions staying exceptional
 
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
in other ways but in order to understand
 
00:08:50.509 --> 00:08:50.519 align:start position:0%
how different it is here you need to
 
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:52.240 align:start position:0%
understand how it's done almost
 
00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:54.040 align:start position:0%
everywhere else and for how long it's
 
00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
been done differently and in my view
 
00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:00.200 align:start position:0%
better whatever that means
 
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh just a little uh background about
 
00:09:05.389 --> 00:09:05.399 align:start position:0%
myself I have very broadly trained I've
 
00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:07.160 align:start position:0%
tried to remain a generalist so I've
 
00:09:08.829 --> 00:09:08.839 align:start position:0%
been on the faculties of schools of
 
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
medicine Law Public Policy uh and now
 
00:09:16.509 --> 00:09:16.519 align:start position:0%
public health um but for 15 years uh I
 
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
was in the federal government in the uh
 
00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:21.519 align:start position:0%
federal system I was the chief rule rule
 
00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:23.720 align:start position:0%
writer and regulator at the occupational
 
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
safety and health administration uh OSHA
 
00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
under President Clinton and then
 
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:30.040 align:start position:0%
president uh bush
 
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
43 uh I was for a few years the chief
 
00:09:35.069 --> 00:09:35.079 align:start position:0%
oan enforcement official and a big swath
 
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
of the country uh in the uh Rocky
 
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:39.720 align:start position:0%
Mountain and and Midwestern
 
00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
states uh but I bring a lot of federal
 
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:44.440 align:start position:0%
experience but I've also advised and
 
00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
worked with and worked for uh numerous
 
00:09:49.389 --> 00:09:49.399 align:start position:0%
states and cities and other countries so
 
00:09:51.509 --> 00:09:51.519 align:start position:0%
I have a short list here of states that
 
00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
I've advised so I know how State
 
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
Environmental agencies work uh as well
 
00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:57.320 align:start position:0%
and how I wrote an ordinance for
 
00:09:59.710 --> 00:09:59.720 align:start position:0%
Philadelphia on on chemical and dry
 
00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:03.880 align:start position:0%
cleaning I worked in Mexico City uh and
 
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
I think the the uh takeaway here is that
 
00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:11.320 align:start position:0%
uh as I'll say I'm going to get to my
 
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
sort of bottom line in just a couple
 
00:10:15.069 --> 00:10:15.079 align:start position:0%
more slides uh and then feel free to
 
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
once I get the the two big points out
 
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
feel free to interrupt and ask questions
 
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
but um couple of slides about uh my
 
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
background um so I'm a primarily a
 
00:10:27.269 --> 00:10:27.279 align:start position:0%
public health scientist but I I taught
 
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
at a law school they were very nice to
 
00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:30.920 align:start position:0%
keep me around for uh for eight years at
 
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
at University of Pennsylvania uh but
 
00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
among other things I'm one of two people
 
00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:37.160 align:start position:0%
in the country who have been chosen by
 
00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:39.800 align:start position:0%
the National Academy of Sciences uh uh
 
00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
to be on their their two committees that
 
00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:44.360 align:start position:0%
have uh occurred at 15-year intervals to
 
00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
look at how risk is assessed and managed
 
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
in the federal government so the first
 
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
of such report was in 1994 uh another
 
00:10:57.269 --> 00:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
one in 2009 and the uh the third person
 
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunately is since passed but uh two
 
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:02.200 align:start position:0%
of us remaining who were chosen both in
 
00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:05.560 align:start position:0%
94 and 2009 to to look at the federal
 
00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
system and again I'm a scientist but I I
 
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
am strangely proud of this this is the
 
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
most important administrative law
 
00:11:14.829 --> 00:11:14.839 align:start position:0%
journal and it's been around for uh 66
 
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
years um 76 years excuse me and I
 
00:11:20.509 --> 00:11:20.519 align:start position:0%
somehow have the second most downloaded
 
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh article from that uh Journal over all
 
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:23.949 align:start position:0%
uh article from that uh Journal over all
that

00:11:23.949 --> 00:11:23.959 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:11:27.949 --> 00:11:27.959 align:start position:0%
time uh but my other uh very enjoyable
 
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
and very educational experience was was
 
00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:33.200 align:start position:0%
the founding executive director of a
 
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
program in regulation at the University
 
00:11:36.509 --> 00:11:36.519 align:start position:0%
of Pennsylvania Law School but drawing
 
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
on faculty from uh the whole university
 
00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:41.800 align:start position:0%
and it's it's probably uh I've been gone
 
00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:44.240 align:start position:0%
for uh about almost 10 years now but
 
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
it's probably the preeminent academic uh
 
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:49.240 align:start position:0%
Center studying uh regulation and so the
 
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
first slide had our uh our motto it's a
 
00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
lot of other people's model the wise
 
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
restraints that make us free we all want
 
00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:57.560 align:start position:0%
to be free we live in the in the Live
 
00:11:59.949 --> 00:11:59.959 align:start position:0%
Free State but as I hope this picture
 
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:01.880 align:start position:0%
shows uh the person with the yellow
 
00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:04.120 align:start position:0%
license plate is enjoying his or her
 
00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
Freedom by driving the wrong way on the
 
00:12:07.949 --> 00:12:07.959 align:start position:0%
interstate and everyone else is not
 
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
quite as free as they were uh because
 
00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:13.000 align:start position:0%
this one person is is uh fulfilling his
 
00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:15.800 align:start position:0%
or her um no one as the boss of me but
 
00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
without the the the restraints in place
 
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
we would have Anarchy on the roads so
 
00:12:24.069 --> 00:12:24.079 align:start position:0%
this program has put out any number of
 
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
of books I brought one of them I've got
 
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
some other book covers here uh but
 
00:12:31.949 --> 00:12:31.959 align:start position:0%
particularly we uh we con conceived and
 
00:12:35.189 --> 00:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
and led the largest project ever on how
 
00:12:37.829 --> 00:12:37.839 align:start position:0%
Regulatory Agencies succeed or fail
 
00:12:39.069 --> 00:12:39.079 align:start position:0%
around the world it was called the
 
00:12:40.829 --> 00:12:40.839 align:start position:0%
best-in-class initiative it still has
 
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
its own website uh was funded by the uh
 
00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
province of Alberta Canada uh but we
 
00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:48.760 align:start position:0%
went all over Canada and then remotely
 
00:12:50.509 --> 00:12:50.519 align:start position:0%
all over the world looking at how
 
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
different agencies succeed or fail and
 
00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:55.720 align:start position:0%
the the the motto there was listen learn
 
00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
and Lead You have to engage with the
 
00:12:59.550 --> 00:12:59.560 align:start position:0%
public and I'll show us slide at the
 
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
very end with more Graphics about this
 
00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
but engage with the public uh learn from
 
00:13:08.829 --> 00:13:08.839 align:start position:0%
them um and then be proactive not just
 
00:13:12.069 --> 00:13:12.079 align:start position:0%
respond uh belatedly to things that that
 
00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:14.440 align:start position:0%
you can no longer ignore but but look
 
00:13:16.949 --> 00:13:16.959 align:start position:0%
forward so here's the takeaway and after
 
00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
I get through these two slides I'm happy
 
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:22.120 align:start position:0%
to to be interrupted uh so as I said we
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
are an exceptional state but we should
 
00:13:25.509 --> 00:13:25.519 align:start position:0%
really understand how different the rest
 
00:13:26.949 --> 00:13:26.959 align:start position:0%
of the country and the rest of the world
 
00:13:31.069 --> 00:13:31.079 align:start position:0%
is secondly it is it is frankly very
 
00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
much more difficult for agencies to
 
00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
regulate or not however they please
 
00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
everywhere else but but this state as
 
00:13:40.949 --> 00:13:40.959 align:start position:0%
far as I can tell and having so much
 
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
discretion is not good for for business
 
00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:45.839 align:start position:0%
or for public health in the environment
 
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
depending on who's in power and who is
 
00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
allowing all of this unfettered uh Juris
 
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
discretion uh to take
 
00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
place I've not met too many people who
 
00:13:58.670 --> 00:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
are more bullish aggressive about the
 
00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
unfair finished business of public
 
00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
health and safety and the environment I
 
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
a huge supporter of you want to call it
 
00:14:06.189 --> 00:14:06.199 align:start position:0%
the Deep State or the administrative
 
00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:08.120 align:start position:0%
State I think these agencies do an
 
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:09.880 align:start position:0%
enormous service to the country and the
 
00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
world and they need staff and funds and
 
00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:16.600 align:start position:0%
power and discretion and Authority uh
 
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
and deference and respect but not too
 
00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:23.480 align:start position:0%
much not so much that they go off and
 
00:14:25.269 --> 00:14:25.279 align:start position:0%
either do what they want or do what you
 
00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:27.800 align:start position:0%
know one person in a position of power
 
00:14:29.629 --> 00:14:29.639 align:start position:0%
behind the scenes tells them
 
00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:33.839 align:start position:0%
to do so in a in a in a period of time
 
00:14:36.749 --> 00:14:36.759 align:start position:0%
when for whatever reasons the agencies
 
00:14:40.069 --> 00:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
are being told to deregulate or regulate
 
00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:43.240 align:start position:0%
weekly or regulate not at all uh
 
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
business may like that uh but health and
 
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
environment suffer which eventually
 
00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:49.720 align:start position:0%
means the economy suffers but if you
 
00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
have that kind of system you're
 
00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:53.320 align:start position:0%
incredibly vulnerable to a change in
 
00:14:55.749 --> 00:14:55.759 align:start position:0%
politics such that the next thing you
 
00:14:58.670 --> 00:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
know you have a person in power who is
 
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
dict ating that there should be
 
00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.509 align:start position:0%
dict ating that there should be
overregulation

00:15:01.509 --> 00:15:01.519 align:start position:0%
overregulation
 
00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:05.240 align:start position:0%
and and businesses going under and uh
 
00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
prices going up and going too far to as
 
00:15:11.189 --> 00:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
much as I think it's hard to go too far
 
00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:13.240 align:start position:0%
to protect Public Health we can go too
 
00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
far we can over
 
00:15:19.069 --> 00:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
reggulator economic harm uh when the
 
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
agencies can do whatever they please
 
00:15:24.069 --> 00:15:24.079 align:start position:0%
without these guard rails that that
 
00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
again almost everyone else has and then
 
00:15:29.389 --> 00:15:29.399 align:start position:0%
third it's it's been a very very long
 
00:15:31.309 --> 00:15:31.319 align:start position:0%
time that other states and the federal
 
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
system have modernized and these are the
 
00:15:36.309 --> 00:15:36.319 align:start position:0%
two fundamental ways that I'll talk
 
00:15:39.949 --> 00:15:39.959 align:start position:0%
about since 1946 the federal and many
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
state processes have become much more
 
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
participatory and much more serious than
 
00:15:48.629 --> 00:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire process is that's uh
 
00:15:50.389 --> 00:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
78 years ago under the Truman
 
00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
Administration the administrative
 
00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:54.680 align:start position:0%
procedure Act of 1946 we have an
 
00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
administrative procedure act in New
 
00:15:58.309 --> 00:15:58.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in the rsas but it's it's very
 
00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:00.040 align:start position:0%
different and not nearly as strong as
 
00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
the one that the feds have had for
 
00:16:04.829 --> 00:16:04.839 align:start position:0%
almost 80 years and then secondly for
 
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
for over 40
 
00:16:09.309 --> 00:16:09.319 align:start position:0%
years the federal government and again
 
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
many states have adopted this over over
 
00:16:14.069 --> 00:16:14.079 align:start position:0%
time has insisted that the central
 
00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:16.040 align:start position:0%
question that a regulator always has to
 
00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:19.880 align:start position:0%
ask is not just is this rule legal is it
 
00:16:22.269 --> 00:16:22.279 align:start position:0%
compliant is it written in English does
 
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
it check off all the boxes Is it wise
 
00:16:29.189 --> 00:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
and the field of risk assessment and
 
00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
cost benefit assessment has developed
 
00:16:33.389 --> 00:16:33.399 align:start position:0%
over that time it started even before
 
00:16:34.509 --> 00:16:34.519 align:start position:0%
that it's actually the Army Corps of
 
00:16:36.509 --> 00:16:36.519 align:start position:0%
Engineers who invented cost benefit
 
00:16:38.829 --> 00:16:38.839 align:start position:0%
analysis for dams and other projects in
 
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
the 1920s but that's the way that the
 
00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:43.269 align:start position:0%
the 1920s but that's the way that the
federal

00:16:43.269 --> 00:16:43.279 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.079 align:start position:0%
government insists on always asking the
 
00:16:48.389 --> 00:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
question do the benefits of a project or
 
00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:50.600 align:start position:0%
a rule outweigh their costs and if it if
 
00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
they don't the government is not
 
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
supposed to allow the agency to just go
 
00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:56.600 align:start position:0%
off and do things that cause more harm
 
00:16:59.150 --> 00:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
than good right that makes sense but we
 
00:17:01.829 --> 00:17:01.839 align:start position:0%
don't have that here we never ask Is it
 
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
wise and here here's my slide about that
 
00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:07.079 align:start position:0%
the agencies the legislature the the
 
00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:09.400 align:start position:0%
four councils for the environmental
 
00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
agencies JL car for the legislature and
 
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
the courts incessantly but only ask is
 
00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:18.280 align:start position:0%
the rule legal and everywhere else we
 
00:17:22.029 --> 00:17:22.039 align:start position:0%
ask Is it wise so here's a quote um from
 
00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:24.679 align:start position:0%
my my binge watching of of these
 
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
proceedings this was house Judiciary
 
00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:29.480 align:start position:0%
earlier this year uh a bill uh to
 
00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
improve judicial review which in my view
 
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
didn't get a very fair hearing uh in the
 
00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:35.320 align:start position:0%
committee but the chair of the way of
 
00:17:37.789 --> 00:17:37.799 align:start position:0%
the wetlands Council came Mr Kimble and
 
00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
said you know very forthrightly we're
 
00:17:41.909 --> 00:17:41.919 align:start position:0%
not here to protect the environment we
 
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
protect the statute and that's that's
 
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
true and that's important but that's
 
00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
very telling that the councils Do Not
 
00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
are not instructed to think about the
 
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:52.600 align:start position:0%
cost and benefits they're just
 
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
instructed to think about the
 
00:17:59.669 --> 00:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
statute so again um I I've been in the
 
00:18:02.789 --> 00:18:02.799 align:start position:0%
field of cost benefit assessment for 40
 
00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
years I've helped to invent it and and
 
00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
modernize it and it's got a lot of
 
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
critics and detractors but it's a way of
 
00:18:12.549 --> 00:18:12.559 align:start position:0%
thinking about goods and harms and it's
 
00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
structured and it and I'll I think the
 
00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
next slide well not quite uh sorry um
 
00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
this is just a picture of Harry Truman
 
00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:20.909 align:start position:0%
this is just a picture of Harry Truman
in

00:18:20.909 --> 00:18:20.919 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
1946 um so this is talking about
 
00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:25.880 align:start position:0%
administrative procedure act and I just
 
00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:29.480 align:start position:0%
highlighted that as I'll continue to to
 
00:18:33.669 --> 00:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
elaborate on the the process allows the
 
00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:36.520 align:start position:0%
affected public it could be business it
 
00:18:38.789 --> 00:18:38.799 align:start position:0%
could be experts it could be homeowners
 
00:18:41.149 --> 00:18:41.159 align:start position:0%
uh anybody you know with with voting
 
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
rights in in the state or the country to
 
00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:47.240 align:start position:0%
participate and the federal law says
 
00:18:48.789 --> 00:18:48.799 align:start position:0%
that a party is entitled to present
 
00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:51.320 align:start position:0%
their case with oral or documentary
 
00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:53.320 align:start position:0%
evidence to submit rebuttal evidence to
 
00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:55.720 align:start position:0%
conduct cross-examination this is how
 
00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
and I'll show you in a minute an example
 
00:19:00.149 --> 00:19:00.159 align:start position:0%
this is how public he ings work in other
 
00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
places but they don't work that way here
 
00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:03.480 align:start position:0%
and some of us were at a hearing and
 
00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:06.280 align:start position:0%
conquered what two two three weeks ago
 
00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
um which I'll describe and you were
 
00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:10.120 align:start position:0%
there was very different than the way
 
00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
hearing is and should be and the rest of
 
00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
the administrative procedure act talks
 
00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
about what happens at the end when the
 
00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:20.200 align:start position:0%
courts get hold of it and again
 
00:19:22.149 --> 00:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
arbitrary and capricious these are words
 
00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:24.440 align:start position:0%
that people elsewhere learn in the first
 
00:19:26.549 --> 00:19:26.559 align:start position:0%
week of law school or the first week of
 
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh policy School um I was incredibly
 
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
fortunate at a young age I took
 
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
administrative law from a then not very
 
00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
well-known guy named Steve Brier who
 
00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
became CH Justice of the Supreme Court
 
00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:41.720 align:start position:0%
and a brilliant teacher uh but you know
 
00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:43.240 align:start position:0%
arbitrary and capricious that was just
 
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
over and over again that's the way it
 
00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
works everywhere else you are not
 
00:19:49.149 --> 00:19:49.159 align:start position:0%
allowed to be arbitrary or capricious
 
00:19:52.029 --> 00:19:52.039 align:start position:0%
and there are tons of cases that try to
 
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
explain what that means and it's it's
 
00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
going to depend on the judge and depend
 
00:19:57.909 --> 00:19:57.919 align:start position:0%
on the situation but here we don't have
 
00:19:59.510 --> 00:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
that here we have
 
00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
uh hope I got this in the right order
 
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
not yet uh but anyway we we our
 
00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:05.720 align:start position:0%
administrative procedure act talks about
 
00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:07.640 align:start position:0%
uh things like clear error of fact or
 
00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:11.080 align:start position:0%
law or uh the agency acted unlawfully or
 
00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:13.640 align:start position:0%
unreasonably and that unreasonably is a
 
00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
little bit close to arbitrary but it's
 
00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
not nearly strong enough so that a court
 
00:20:19.789 --> 00:20:19.799 align:start position:0%
can actually listen to whether it's the
 
00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
business or the public coming in and
 
00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
saying we tried our best through the
 
00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
whole process to get some common sense
 
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
here and we we haven't gotten it we're
 
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
looking to the courts to
 
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:31.240 align:start position:0%
believe us that the agency acted
 
00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
arbitrarily and it doesn't happen here
 
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
almost all rules are upheld because the
 
00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:39.039 align:start position:0%
courts are instructed by Statute to only
 
00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:42.280 align:start position:0%
look at um clear errors of factor law
 
00:20:44.149 --> 00:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
and that's just not
 
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
enough and then the other piece of it is
 
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
this cost benefit piece so this is from
 
00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
New York Times 1981 uh Ronald Reagan is
 
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:52.760 align:start position:0%
the one who put the executive order in
 
00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:55.880 align:start position:0%
place that said you can't regulate first
 
00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:57.400 align:start position:0%
of all you have to show that there's a
 
00:20:59.789 --> 00:20:59.799 align:start position:0%
market failure which basically means
 
00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
that we need government to come in and
 
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
correct something if the market can do
 
00:21:07.549 --> 00:21:07.559 align:start position:0%
it then the the the bias is we don't
 
00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
need guard rails let the market solve
 
00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:11.240 align:start position:0%
the problem but if there's a market
 
00:21:13.789 --> 00:21:13.799 align:start position:0%
failure pollution is cheap so the
 
00:21:16.029 --> 00:21:16.039 align:start position:0%
polluter just pollute because no one
 
00:21:18.789 --> 00:21:18.799 align:start position:0%
prices it properly that's when you need
 
00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:20.559 align:start position:0%
uh the EPA to come in and say no it
 
00:21:23.029 --> 00:21:23.039 align:start position:0%
can't be free it has to be you have to
 
00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
compensate or you have to uh uh regulate
 
00:21:28.269 --> 00:21:28.279 align:start position:0%
so this uh Time Magazine said this was
 
00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:29.720 align:start position:0%
one of nine executive orders that
 
00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:31.400 align:start position:0%
changed American history I forget when
 
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
they said that but probably over you
 
00:21:38.909 --> 00:21:38.919 align:start position:0%
know hundreds of years um and so that
 
00:21:41.029 --> 00:21:41.039 align:start position:0%
executive order again it's been in full
 
00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%
effect for all that time uh has created
 
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
a system in the federal government and
 
00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
some states have now mimicked this where
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
in addition to all the public process
 
00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
I'm going to talk about there is an
 
00:21:55.149 --> 00:21:55.159 align:start position:0%
internal process in the executive branch
 
00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh and so it's in in the federal system
 
00:21:58.990 --> 00:21:59.000 align:start position:0%
it's the Office of Management and budget
 
00:22:01.149 --> 00:22:01.159 align:start position:0%
and they have a subgroup called oira the
 
00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
office of information and Regulatory
 
00:22:05.149 --> 00:22:05.159 align:start position:0%
Affairs and now the head of that office
 
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
has been called for some decades the
 
00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:07.950 align:start position:0%
has been called for some decades the
regulatory

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:07.960 align:start position:0%
regulatory
 
00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
Zar uh now in the agencies we didn't
 
00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
like frankly we didn't like these people
 
00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
we didn't like any any of the Zars we
 
00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:16.360 align:start position:0%
didn't like their staff
 
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
but they did a lot of good they forced
 
00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
us to come in day after day month after
 
00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
month and justify what we were doing
 
00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
because we were all part of the
 
00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
executive branch and the was the
 
00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
president's delegate to
 
00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:35.320 align:start position:0%
say usually frankly and they will admit
 
00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
it they were saying we need these rules
 
00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
to be a little less strict and a little
 
00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
more flexible for business that's our
 
00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:44.200 align:start position:0%
we're economists that's what we do uh
 
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
but also a lot of science a lot of
 
00:22:49.149 --> 00:22:49.159 align:start position:0%
procedure uh a lot of meetings where we
 
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
came out of it kind of angry that you
 
00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:55.240 align:start position:0%
know we lost something or you know we it
 
00:22:57.149 --> 00:22:57.159 align:start position:0%
was round seven and we got you know hit
 
00:22:59.190 --> 00:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
in the face but we came out of it with a
 
00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:00.799 align:start position:0%
better rule than when we came in because
 
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
smart people were who were not um
 
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
obsessed with you know this chemical or
 
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
this Hazard were taking a fresh look and
 
00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:11.240 align:start position:0%
saying well actually you know you could
 
00:23:13.549 --> 00:23:13.559 align:start position:0%
you could get most of what you want in a
 
00:23:15.149 --> 00:23:15.159 align:start position:0%
different way and and we're going to
 
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
pretty much force you to do it that way
 
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
because we have the authority but again
 
00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:21.720 align:start position:0%
that was a checkin balance that that
 
00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:24.440 align:start position:0%
just does not exist
 
00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
here uh again the field of cost benefit
 
00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
and risk assessment it's I heard I
 
00:23:30.789 --> 00:23:30.799 align:start position:0%
forget who it was but I heard somebody
 
00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
on the committee uh on the on the
 
00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
YouTube a few months ago
 
00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:37.240 align:start position:0%
saying what do you mean we're going to
 
00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:39.240 align:start position:0%
estimate the the
 
00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
monetary U value of some protection and
 
00:23:44.029 --> 00:23:44.039 align:start position:0%
we're going to compare it to the
 
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
economic cost that seems like Voodoo to
 
00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:47.960 align:start position:0%
me person didn't use the word voodoo but
 
00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
seemed kind of surprised that that that
 
00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:52.360 align:start position:0%
that could even be done well believe me
 
00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
it's been done every day of every week
 
00:23:58.110 --> 00:23:58.120 align:start position:0%
for 50 plus years and there people I've
 
00:23:59.789 --> 00:23:59.799 align:start position:0%
devoted a part of my career but I know
 
00:24:02.029 --> 00:24:02.039 align:start position:0%
many people who've devoted their entire
 
00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
academic professional lives to studying
 
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
these problems and and doing this kind
 
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
of work so we have a journal that has 12
 
00:24:13.029 --> 00:24:13.039 align:start position:0%
articles a month for 44 years now uh and
 
00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
and lots of other academic journals um
 
00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
if you want to look at it later here's
 
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
the current issue of the Journal of
 
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:21.240 align:start position:0%
benefit cost
 
00:24:23.549 --> 00:24:23.559 align:start position:0%
analysis don't want to show any numbers
 
00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
or any uh uh you know any math here but
 
00:24:28.389 --> 00:24:28.399 align:start position:0%
just to give you a sense so this is the
 
00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
naal highway traffic safety
 
00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:32.240 align:start position:0%
administration now we have to have
 
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
cameras in all of our Passenger cars
 
00:24:35.909 --> 00:24:35.919 align:start position:0%
it's been phased in over time but new
 
00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:37.960 align:start position:0%
cars have to have this little camera and
 
00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
the reason for the camera is that people
 
00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:44.360 align:start position:0%
were obviously keeping track and uh I
 
00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
forget the exact number but it was a
 
00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:50.120 align:start position:0%
dozen or more kids three years and under
 
00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:52.120 align:start position:0%
were were killed every year by being
 
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
backed up over by Passenger cars and
 
00:24:57.389 --> 00:24:57.399 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it was typically the the
 
00:24:59.110 --> 00:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
the child's own parent who didn't see
 
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
the child playing behind the station
 
00:25:02.669 --> 00:25:02.679 align:start position:0%
wagon in their
 
00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:05.240 align:start position:0%
driveway uh and so there is you know the
 
00:25:08.909 --> 00:25:08.919 align:start position:0%
techniques are uh you I have no time to
 
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
go into this is a whole semester of of a
 
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
course but there are well-developed
 
00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
economic techniques to say it's
 
00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
subjective but how much is a life worth
 
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
well how much is an injury worth how
 
00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
much are people willing to pay uh to
 
00:25:23.029 --> 00:25:23.039 align:start position:0%
avert an injury or to avert a fatal
 
00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
accident and of course the price of the
 
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
camera is you can get that from the
 
00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
catalog and the price goes down always
 
00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:31.480 align:start position:0%
because we make more of them and learn
 
00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:34.360 align:start position:0%
how to make them cheaper but Nitsa said
 
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
the the benefits
 
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
of reducing by some and and and they can
 
00:25:41.789 --> 00:25:41.799 align:start position:0%
of course estimate how you're not going
 
00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:43.880 align:start position:0%
to prevent every fatality by having a
 
00:25:45.029 --> 00:25:45.039 align:start position:0%
camera people won't look at their
 
00:25:46.549 --> 00:25:46.559 align:start position:0%
cameras but there's studies that say if
 
00:25:48.909 --> 00:25:48.919 align:start position:0%
you have a camera you're less likely to
 
00:25:51.269 --> 00:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
run over an object you can't see uh and
 
00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
so they compare those two things and
 
00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
they went to the the government they
 
00:25:55.909 --> 00:25:55.919 align:start position:0%
went to the public went to the court and
 
00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
said we think it's a good idea to save
 
00:25:59.950 --> 00:25:59.960 align:start position:0%
kids lives by requiring the price of a
 
00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:02.360 align:start position:0%
car to go up by it turns out about $70 a
 
00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:05.320 align:start position:0%
car to have this technology in place and
 
00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
it got through the system and it went to
 
00:26:08.549 --> 00:26:08.559 align:start position:0%
court and the judges said yeah this
 
00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:10.520 align:start position:0%
makes sense to
 
00:26:13.389 --> 00:26:13.399 align:start position:0%
us uh and a similar one I just finished
 
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh last year working for the consumer
 
00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
product safety commission uh on the we
 
00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919 align:start position:0%
don't have them here but uh Venetian
 
00:26:22.389 --> 00:26:22.399 align:start position:0%
blinds with with the strings on them the
 
00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
strings strangle about 10 babies every
 
00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
year because they are left alone and
 
00:26:28.669 --> 00:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
they get caught in the qu of course you
 
00:26:31.029 --> 00:26:31.039 align:start position:0%
can make Venetian blinds without strings
 
00:26:32.789 --> 00:26:32.799 align:start position:0%
that go down to the level where a baby
 
00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:34.559 align:start position:0%
can can grab onto it but that's that
 
00:26:36.269 --> 00:26:36.279 align:start position:0%
costs money so you have to do cost
 
00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
benefit and another rule that's tied up
 
00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:42.200 align:start position:0%
in court but we think it will uh
 
00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
Prevail so now I have about seven or
 
00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:46.799 align:start position:0%
eight slides that I don't want anybody
 
00:26:49.269 --> 00:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
to to read or or but I want to give a
 
00:26:52.269 --> 00:26:52.279 align:start position:0%
visual impression of
 
00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
how regimented and and uh I don't want
 
00:26:58.269 --> 00:26:58.279 align:start position:0%
to use the word cumbersome because I do
 
00:27:00.389 --> 00:27:00.399 align:start position:0%
believe this is all for the good but
 
00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:02.840 align:start position:0%
when you compare it to the New Hampshire
 
00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
process which is
 
00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:07.480 align:start position:0%
basically the agency says we feel like
 
00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:09.240 align:start position:0%
writing a rule or we have to update a
 
00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
rule um here's a proposed rule we're
 
00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
going to have a listening session for an
 
00:27:17.149 --> 00:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
hour or two where we don't really we we
 
00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
listen but we don't hear uh and then
 
00:27:20.789 --> 00:27:20.799 align:start position:0%
here's the final which looks very much
 
00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:22.760 align:start position:0%
like the proposal maybe exactly like the
 
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
proposal and let's go to jail car and
 
00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:26.600 align:start position:0%
have a little happy talk and let them
 
00:27:28.909 --> 00:27:28.919 align:start position:0%
rubber stamp it uh and then we're okay
 
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
because the courts don't the courts
 
00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:33.640 align:start position:0%
defer to us the federal system in many
 
00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
states have a just an incredibly
 
00:27:38.029 --> 00:27:38.039 align:start position:0%
different process so rather than show
 
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
these slides of steps one through nine
 
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
and specific analyses required and a
 
00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:47.320 align:start position:0%
whole different uh set of uh charts that
 
00:27:48.909 --> 00:27:48.919 align:start position:0%
a consulting firm puts out every year
 
00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:51.880 align:start position:0%
called the reg map uh this one is like
 
00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
you know building the space shuttle with
 
00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
all of these arrows going back to other
 
00:27:58.950 --> 00:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
arrows and colorcoded
 
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
things I'll I'll just try in like two
 
00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:03.720 align:start position:0%
minutes to go through a typical process
 
00:28:05.029 --> 00:28:05.039 align:start position:0%
at at the federal
 
00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
level uh so basically and again just to
 
00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:11.960 align:start position:0%
give the the flavor that that this is
 
00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
very foreign to what goes on here first
 
00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
of all you can't just in the federal
 
00:28:20.029 --> 00:28:20.039 align:start position:0%
system in many states you can't just
 
00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:22.240 align:start position:0%
announce that like here's our proposed
 
00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
rule there has to
 
00:28:26.909 --> 00:28:26.919 align:start position:0%
be participatory processes you have to
 
00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
have an agenda you have to publish in
 
00:28:30.149 --> 00:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
the Federal Register these are the
 
00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
things we want to work on for the next
 
00:28:34.389 --> 00:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
one year and four years you get to you
 
00:28:35.909 --> 00:28:35.919 align:start position:0%
have to take public comment on that are
 
00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:37.720 align:start position:0%
your priority screwed up are you missing
 
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
something are you doing something
 
00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
Overkill that you you know you keep
 
00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:42.440 align:start position:0%
coming back to this and we need you to
 
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
do other things as I said you have to
 
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
show that there's a market failure to be
 
00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
corrected now very often even before the
 
00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
proposed rule uh agencies will put out
 
00:28:54.389 --> 00:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
what they call a request for information
 
00:28:56.789 --> 00:28:56.799 align:start position:0%
or an advanced notice of rul making to
 
00:28:59.909 --> 00:28:59.919 align:start position:0%
bring in industry and affected and
 
00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:02.200 align:start position:0%
experts to say okay these are the sorts
 
00:29:04.269 --> 00:29:04.279 align:start position:0%
of studies you should be reading these
 
00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:07.720 align:start position:0%
are the sorts of uh uh visits you should
 
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
make to companies and and innovators and
 
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
affected communities to get a handle on
 
00:29:18.269 --> 00:29:18.279 align:start position:0%
how to start to uh circumscribe the rule
 
00:29:20.909 --> 00:29:20.919 align:start position:0%
uh then most federal agencies have a
 
00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
whole separate track where the small
 
00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:27.039 align:start position:0%
business Lobby has successfully argued
 
00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
with its own law now from the 1990s that
 
00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
there has to be an entire public hearing
 
00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
it's a private hearing but conducted in
 
00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:36.440 align:start position:0%
front of the public with 15
 
00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
representatives of small business and
 
00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
they get to look at the proposal before
 
00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:43.480 align:start position:0%
the public does and and there has to be
 
00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
a written report of the small business
 
00:29:49.029 --> 00:29:49.039 align:start position:0%
panel with the agency collaborating to
 
00:29:52.269 --> 00:29:52.279 align:start position:0%
to write down how this rule is going to
 
00:29:56.389 --> 00:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
be tailored for so that small business
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
can comply without undo economic harm it
 
00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
may mean that workers of these small
 
00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
companies or people who live Downstream
 
00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
they may actually get more harm than
 
00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:09.480 align:start position:0%
people affected by large companies
 
00:30:10.909 --> 00:30:10.919 align:start position:0%
because the country has decided that
 
00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:12.760 align:start position:0%
small business needs a break so that's a
 
00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
whole another diversion back into the
 
00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
major part of the process uh then we
 
00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
often will have what they call
 
00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
negotiated rul making committees where
 
00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
instead of here's the rule let's talk we
 
00:30:30.149 --> 00:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
actually have formal negotiations uh
 
00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
presided over by a mediator with
 
00:30:35.149 --> 00:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
industry and the affected public and we
 
00:30:37.029 --> 00:30:37.039 align:start position:0%
all sit down and takes a couple years to
 
00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
actually write the rule in that in that
 
00:30:40.909 --> 00:30:40.919 align:start position:0%
way but assuming that doesn't happen it
 
00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:43.640 align:start position:0%
goes into the regular uh process so
 
00:30:46.389 --> 00:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
there's a proposal that comes out like
 
00:30:48.269 --> 00:30:48.279 align:start position:0%
we have here but before it comes out
 
00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:49.640 align:start position:0%
there are these endless meetings with
 
00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:51.640 align:start position:0%
the White House Economist to say before
 
00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:53.320 align:start position:0%
anybody can see it we're going to look
 
00:30:55.789 --> 00:30:55.799 align:start position:0%
at every word and tweak it so that it's
 
00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
more efficient it it gets the job done
 
00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:58.470 align:start position:0%
more efficient it it gets the job done
with

00:30:58.470 --> 00:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:31:01.509 --> 00:31:01.519 align:start position:0%
with less cost all right public hearings
 
00:31:04.629 --> 00:31:04.639 align:start position:0%
so I was and some of you were at the
 
00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:06.760 align:start position:0%
dees Hearing in conquered on the 20th of
 
00:31:09.389 --> 00:31:09.399 align:start position:0%
May I think it was 90 minutes it was
 
00:31:11.389 --> 00:31:11.399 align:start position:0%
everybody gets their their three minutes
 
00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
they were very generous they let people
 
00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
come back a second time but it was one
 
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.789 align:start position:0%
come back a second time but it was one
way

00:31:17.789 --> 00:31:17.799 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:31:20.509 --> 00:31:20.519 align:start position:0%
no response other than thank you your
 
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
time is
 
00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
up in the federal government and Most
 
00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:26.840 align:start position:0%
states they are public hearings where
 
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
where there is Di dialogue and OSHA and
 
00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
some other agencies have what I think is
 
00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
is the best process it's the hardest to
 
00:31:38.029 --> 00:31:38.039 align:start position:0%
get through but I say we I haven't been
 
00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:40.760 align:start position:0%
there in many years but we would have by
 
00:31:43.029 --> 00:31:43.039 align:start position:0%
by law the hearings would be presided
 
00:31:46.029 --> 00:31:46.039 align:start position:0%
over by a judge and the agency would sit
 
00:31:48.029 --> 00:31:48.039 align:start position:0%
at the podium and the witnesses would
 
00:31:51.389 --> 00:31:51.399 align:start position:0%
come up one by one give their testimony
 
00:31:54.269 --> 00:31:54.279 align:start position:0%
and cross-examine the agency and the
 
00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:56.440 align:start position:0%
staff would have to answer on the spot
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
in front of a judge who would say
 
00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh that's not a very you know we could
 
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
say we need to get back to you on that
 
00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:04.559 align:start position:0%
but the hearing would always go for many
 
00:32:06.029 --> 00:32:06.039 align:start position:0%
days so the judge would say fine I'll
 
00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:07.720 align:start position:0%
you know I'll expect that answer
 
00:32:09.789 --> 00:32:09.799 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and we'd go home and stay up
 
00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
half the night and get the answer uh and
 
00:32:14.549 --> 00:32:14.559 align:start position:0%
we could cross-examine the witnesses if
 
00:32:16.789 --> 00:32:16.799 align:start position:0%
somebody came up there and and spouted
 
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
some junk science we had great people on
 
00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
the staff who would very nicely say you
 
00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
know have you taken math in like have
 
00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:26.120 align:start position:0%
you figured out how add number like your
 
00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
math doesn't add up uh your using a
 
00:32:30.149 --> 00:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
paper that was retracted uh it's you
 
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
know it's a gray literature thing that
 
00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
that nobody believes so it went both
 
00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:38.360 align:start position:0%
ways and it's an outlier but most of our
 
00:32:40.909 --> 00:32:40.919 align:start position:0%
hearings at OSHA went for about a week
 
00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:43.720 align:start position:0%
so 40 hours of
 
00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
testimony just before I got there they
 
00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
finished the longest Hearing in human
 
00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:52.120 align:start position:0%
history uh my my boss Robert Rice who I
 
00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
Lov dearly great guy uh very smart guy
 
00:32:56.669 --> 00:32:56.679 align:start position:0%
but he was way ahead of his time he
 
00:32:59.430 --> 00:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to ban smoking in the in Federal
 
00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
in in all in all private sector
 
00:33:04.629 --> 00:33:04.639 align:start position:0%
workplaces in 1994 way ahead of his time
 
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
with all the literature about secondhand
 
00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:07.960 align:start position:0%
smoke and the epidemiology of Cancer all
 
00:33:10.029 --> 00:33:10.039 align:start position:0%
that good stuff but that hearing lasted
 
00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
for five months five days a week eight
 
00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
hours a day with a judge for five
 
00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:19.880 align:start position:0%
months with yeah some people just lining
 
00:33:21.509 --> 00:33:21.519 align:start position:0%
up around the block saying don't take my
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
cigarettes away and and we had to say
 
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
thank you you know we have heard this
 
00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
but you have every right to add your
 
00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:30.440 align:start position:0%
voice to the to the chorus but a lot of
 
00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:34.360 align:start position:0%
Industry people uh and their um fellow
 
00:33:36.029 --> 00:33:36.039 align:start position:0%
Travelers saying you know here's
 
00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
scientific literature that says that
 
00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:39.720 align:start position:0%
secondhand smoke is not so bad for you
 
00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
or not bad for you at all and we had to
 
00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:44.360 align:start position:0%
listen to all that uh we ended up
 
00:33:46.629 --> 00:33:46.639 align:start position:0%
failing it was there's so much outcry
 
00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
back then that it didn't happen but
 
00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:51.320 align:start position:0%
that's the idea of what a serious public
 
00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
dialogue is and it Bears no resemblance
 
00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
to what uh we saw two weeks ago
 
00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:01.720 align:start position:0%
okay then uh the final rule is written
 
00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
and the big difference again contrasting
 
00:34:07.269 --> 00:34:07.279 align:start position:0%
to here and I I will now show a slide of
 
00:34:09.629 --> 00:34:09.639 align:start position:0%
this so again lot of words on the page
 
00:34:11.669 --> 00:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
here but this is a rule I led the
 
00:34:14.069 --> 00:34:14.079 align:start position:0%
development of in in the 1990s it is the
 
00:34:15.869 --> 00:34:15.879 align:start position:0%
federal standard on respiratory
 
00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
protection uh don't get me started uh
 
00:34:22.669 --> 00:34:22.679 align:start position:0%
but here's one line from a a rule that's
 
00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
probably 10 pages long the employer
 
00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
shall identify a physician or other
 
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
licensed Healthcare Prof professional
 
00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:31.720 align:start position:0%
plhcp to perform medical evaluations etc
 
00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:33.560 align:start position:0%
etc one
 
00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:35.800 align:start position:0%
sentence now I'm I'm cherry picking that
 
00:34:37.470 --> 00:34:37.480 align:start position:0%
was a pretty controversial sense because
 
00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:38.589 align:start position:0%
was a pretty controversial sense because
OSHA

00:34:38.589 --> 00:34:38.599 align:start position:0%
OSHA
 
00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:41.560 align:start position:0%
had thanks in part to me had had decided
 
00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
to change its standard rule from a
 
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
doctor must do everything to a licensed
 
00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
healthc care provider including advanced
 
00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
practice nurses and PAs people who were
 
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
already licensed by their state to do
 
00:34:56.069 --> 00:34:56.079 align:start position:0%
certain things we realized that we had
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
been restraining trade and not allowing
 
00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
um these you know highly qualified
 
00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
people to do it anyway the point is in
 
00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
the preamble to the final rule the
 
00:35:09.109 --> 00:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
document that that contains the final
 
00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
rule every sentence has an explanation
 
00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
of why that sentence either was changed
 
00:35:16.829 --> 00:35:16.839 align:start position:0%
or was not changed so this you can't
 
00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
read it because it's so small but this
 
00:35:22.829 --> 00:35:22.839 align:start position:0%
is about 1,200 words of why we changed
 
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
the doctor must do it to the licensed
 
00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
healthcare provider can do it and as
 
00:35:29.829 --> 00:35:29.839 align:start position:0%
you'll see just from the impression it
 
00:35:32.589 --> 00:35:32.599 align:start position:0%
gives all kinds of references to the the
 
00:35:34.589 --> 00:35:34.599 align:start position:0%
electronic docket which says these
 
00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
Witnesses said we don't like this change
 
00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
for these reasons these Witnesses says
 
00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:42.520 align:start position:0%
we we do and there are literature
 
00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
references that say we looked at all the
 
00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
data and we decided based on these
 
00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
studies and our evaluation of them that
 
00:35:51.309 --> 00:35:51.319 align:start position:0%
that this change is good for the
 
00:35:54.109 --> 00:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
following scientific legal economic
 
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
reasons you know contrast that
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
to we heard we heard a lot of stuff uh
 
00:36:05.069 --> 00:36:05.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:08.079 align:start position:0%
yeah so are you familiar with I'm I'm
 
00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
sure you are the bill um that um
 
00:36:13.589 --> 00:36:13.599 align:start position:0%
actually got incorporated into another
 
00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:15.560 align:start position:0%
bill that has now left the committee of
 
00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:18.200 align:start position:0%
conference which will um kind of bring
 
00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire a little bit forward up to
 
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:23.640 align:start position:0%
speed uh in regards with rules um and
 
00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
then having to uh the agencies of course
 
00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:29.800 align:start position:0%
having to post the public testimony as
 
00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
well as um giving explanation um from
 
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
the testimony that came in about why
 
00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:39.720 align:start position:0%
they you know um denied a rule or
 
00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:42.280 align:start position:0%
accepted it or whatever so um right I
 
00:36:44.309 --> 00:36:44.319 align:start position:0%
mean you deserve almost all the credit
 
00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
for that I think with with chairman
 
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
Maguire of Judiciary yeah it does two
 
00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
things I won't call the baby steps but
 
00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:52.280 align:start position:0%
with all the stuff we have to do uh
 
00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:53.960 align:start position:0%
they're they're it's a piece of the
 
00:36:56.589 --> 00:36:56.599 align:start position:0%
puzzle but yes finally uh instead of
 
00:36:58.870 --> 00:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
having to do a 9 1A request and drive to
 
00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:01.000 align:start position:0%
conquered and read public testimony
 
00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:02.720 align:start position:0%
which comes to the agency electronically
 
00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:05.240 align:start position:0%
anyway they put it online like everybody
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
else does and that will take effect I
 
00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:09.640 align:start position:0%
hope later this year and so people can
 
00:37:12.109 --> 00:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
can see what are the other people uh
 
00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
it's sufficient you know if somebody's
 
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
making your argument for you you don't
 
00:37:17.309 --> 00:37:17.319 align:start position:0%
have to keep hammering the but if
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
somebody's making a fallacious argument
 
00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:21.240 align:start position:0%
you get to see it and then yes there's a
 
00:37:22.829 --> 00:37:22.839 align:start position:0%
new line in that bill that says the
 
00:37:25.829 --> 00:37:25.839 align:start position:0%
agency has to I think it says uh
 
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
enumerate the facts data policy
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
decisions and judgments that cause them
 
00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
to either accept or reject a sub
 
00:37:38.109 --> 00:37:38.119 align:start position:0%
significant public comment so again
 
00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
that's 40 years too late but it's a
 
00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
great step
 
00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
forward do you think there's a
 
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
possibility that um you know timing wise
 
00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:48.839 align:start position:0%
when that
 
00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:51.160 align:start position:0%
from from when that bill goes through
 
00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:54.760 align:start position:0%
that will be able to um kind of maybe
 
00:37:58.349 --> 00:37:58.359 align:start position:0%
force the hand of depending on timing
 
00:38:00.109 --> 00:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying like if something some
 
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
rule was accepted 6 months ago I assume
 
00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:04.640 align:start position:0%
that you know that won't happen but if
 
00:38:07.589 --> 00:38:07.599 align:start position:0%
if rules are in the process now and and
 
00:38:10.349 --> 00:38:10.359 align:start position:0%
and haven't been solidified um do you
 
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
think that we'll be able to in a sense
 
00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:15.640 align:start position:0%
require agencies whether it be Dees or
 
00:38:17.309 --> 00:38:17.319 align:start position:0%
even DHHS because they've got some
 
00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
things coming too down the pike to be
 
00:38:22.309 --> 00:38:22.319 align:start position:0%
able to say okay well we've got this new
 
00:38:24.349 --> 00:38:24.359 align:start position:0%
law that's passed can you make sure that
 
00:38:26.829 --> 00:38:26.839 align:start position:0%
it's applied yeah again it depends on
 
00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:29.640 align:start position:0%
timing but my answer would be that they
 
00:38:31.069 --> 00:38:31.079 align:start position:0%
should be you know someone should force
 
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
them to do it already it should have
 
00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:35.800 align:start position:0%
been happening all along it should
 
00:38:37.309 --> 00:38:37.319 align:start position:0%
happen tomorrow it should happen next
 
00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
year whether it's the courts or public
 
00:38:42.589 --> 00:38:42.599 align:start position:0%
opinion or the press or a new brand new
 
00:38:44.109 --> 00:38:44.119 align:start position:0%
bill that will have to be written to say
 
00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
you know this particular rule you know
 
00:38:49.349 --> 00:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
pick one is accompanied with a response
 
00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
document that's that's arrogant and
 
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
meaningless and haughty and we you know
 
00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
the legislature is tired of that all
 
00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:03.589 --> 00:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
representative hins thank you drle
 
00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
presuming that the federal agencies have
 
00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
more resources to deal with are you
 
00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
familiar with other states that are
 
00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:17.800 align:start position:0%
doing a a rule writing process that is
 
00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
distinctly different from New
 
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yeah I think the one the ones
 
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
I've advised I mean New Jersey is
 
00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
clearly is you know clearly mimics the
 
00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
federal system I I think I count Ed that
 
00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh 36 states have an administrative
 
00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
procedure act at least that that comes
 
00:39:35.589 --> 00:39:35.599 align:start position:0%
right from the federal one of 1946 so
 
00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
the majority of States at least have uh
 
00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
requirements for public hearings that
 
00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:43.480 align:start position:0%
are at least on paper supposed to be U
 
00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
serious and not just one-way uh hearings
 
00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:48.760 align:start position:0%
but I think the more important answer is
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
that of course these things will be you
 
00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
know the states are are Miniatures of of
 
00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
the federal system but the these are not
 
00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
necessarily resource intensive in the
 
00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:01.160 align:start position:0%
extreme or expensive in the extreme
 
00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
obviously having a public hearing where
 
00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:07.880 align:start position:0%
the agency is chooses to or is required
 
00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:10.520 align:start position:0%
to to speak you know the people are
 
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
sitting there anyway so so asking them
 
00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:16.040 align:start position:0%
or requiring them to interact cost
 
00:40:18.829 --> 00:40:18.839 align:start position:0%
nothing a cost benefit analysis I'm I'm
 
00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:21.160 align:start position:0%
going to give you an example now uh that
 
00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:23.960 align:start position:0%
shows up a later but I'm U I'm taking
 
00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:25.240 align:start position:0%
you know too much time to go through
 
00:40:28.349 --> 00:40:28.359 align:start position:0%
these uh is this the one
 
00:40:30.270 --> 00:40:30.280 align:start position:0%
well I'm I'm sorry here the next slide
 
00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
was going to be uh something out of New
 
00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh again I tried not to pick
 
00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
on something I'm I'm working on and have
 
00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
an axe to grind about but but here is uh
 
00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh Dees talking about protecting uh the
 
00:40:45.589 --> 00:40:45.599 align:start position:0%
PCAT Pascal River and the the entire
 
00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
response to uh a serious comment about
 
00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh nitrogen U loading is uh the you know
 
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
we don't think there's a preponderance
 
00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
of the evidence that this is a problem
 
00:40:58.069 --> 00:40:58.079 align:start position:0%
and they might be right but just to say
 
00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:01.640 align:start position:0%
we don't think so
 
00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
uh uh oh yeah this was the one sorry so
 
00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to answer your question
 
00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:07.750 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to answer your question
more

00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:11.240 align:start position:0%
concretely uh so I wrote written
 
00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:14.200 align:start position:0%
comments on the dees landfill rule that
 
00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:15.880 align:start position:0%
that the hearing was on May 20th and the
 
00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:18.040 align:start position:0%
comment period was ended about a week
 
00:41:21.589 --> 00:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
ago and uh I was pretty scathing about
 
00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:23.640 align:start position:0%
the the main sentence in that rule which
 
00:41:27.589 --> 00:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
is 5,000 to 50,000 times weaker than any
 
00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:31.480 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction on the planet India Nigeria
 
00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
Ireland Nova Scotia and every state I
 
00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
found it's it's completely out of the
 
00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
mainstream it's like looking at a the
 
00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:41.800 align:start position:0%
agency said oh we're doing a speed limit
 
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
we looked at other states they're all
 
00:41:45.829 --> 00:41:45.839 align:start position:0%
between 50 and 80 but we chose 5,000
 
00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:49.240 align:start position:0%
miles an hour because we said so and oh
 
00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
yes and then we weakened it to 50,000
 
00:41:52.829 --> 00:41:52.839 align:start position:0%
miles an hour because somebody from the
 
00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
industry said they'd never drive again
 
00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
if they could only go 5,000 m an hour so
 
00:42:00.349 --> 00:42:00.359 align:start position:0%
we went to 50 and uh that's why we did
 
00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
it uh but I also wrote in those comments
 
00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:06.680 align:start position:0%
how about stepping back and instead of
 
00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
all of this page after page about uh
 
00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
landfill shall have have plastic liners
 
00:42:14.910 --> 00:42:14.920 align:start position:0%
and alarms and valves and a lot of good
 
00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
engineering stuff what about a human
 
00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:19.960 align:start position:0%
presence on the site what about a guard
 
00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:22.109 align:start position:0%
presence on the site what about a guard
247

00:42:22.109 --> 00:42:22.119 align:start position:0%
247
 
00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:24.680 align:start position:0%
365 and frankly I was a little sarcastic
 
00:42:26.829 --> 00:42:26.839 align:start position:0%
because thees allows has allowed this to
 
00:42:26.839 --> 00:42:27.910 align:start position:0%
because thees allows has allowed this to
happen

00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:42:30.069 --> 00:42:30.079 align:start position:0%
uh in Bethlehem a few years ago 3-day
 
00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
weekend no one knew about a gigantic
 
00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:34.640 align:start position:0%
leech a bill until Tuesday morning when
 
00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:37.480 align:start position:0%
people showed up for work anyway my
 
00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:40.520 align:start position:0%
point is I wrote in this comment
 
00:42:43.549 --> 00:42:43.559 align:start position:0%
um you know why not add that sentence
 
00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
and the the point is that in a in a
 
00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
serious jurisdiction where public
 
00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
comment was taken seriously that request
 
00:42:55.349 --> 00:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
from you know just some guy would prompt
 
00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
some kind of thought process
 
00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:00.520 align:start position:0%
and the thought process would be pretty
 
00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
simple how expensive is a is a full-time
 
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
guard I don't know is it 35k or 50k
 
00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
that's a
 
00:43:11.309 --> 00:43:11.319 align:start position:0%
number how what's the benefit of a
 
00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:14.440 align:start position:0%
full-time guard you H hire somebody I
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
think I could do this in a day to go
 
00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:20.440 align:start position:0%
online and find Historical examples
 
00:43:21.589 --> 00:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
maybe there's already been a paper
 
00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:23.800 align:start position:0%
written about it I don't know but
 
00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
estimate the probability that a spill
 
00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
will occur of a certain
 
00:43:31.549 --> 00:43:31.559 align:start position:0%
magnitude at at night or over a weekend
 
00:43:33.069 --> 00:43:33.079 align:start position:0%
and that's easy because it's the number
 
00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
of hours in a week divided by the number
 
00:43:36.589 --> 00:43:36.599 align:start position:0%
of hours nobody I mean it would be easy
 
00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
to say over a 20-year planning Horizon
 
00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:43.480 align:start position:0%
we would expect to avert two incidents
 
00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
of certain variety if we had a guard and
 
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
then and then it's pretty easy to say
 
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
okay 100,000 gallons you know the cost
 
00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
of of just cleaning it up even if it
 
00:43:55.870 --> 00:43:55.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't hurt anybody and then compare
 
00:43:58.990 --> 00:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
the 50k a year to the expected number of
 
00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:01.400 align:start position:0%
averted incidents and say which one is
 
00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
greater that's not a huge deal and yeah
 
00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
state would be allowed would be expected
 
00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
to do that more back of the envelope
 
00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
than the feds would but it's still very
 
00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
different from the response I expect to
 
00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:22.270 --> 00:44:22.280 align:start position:0%
nah thank
 
00:44:25.309 --> 00:44:25.319 align:start position:0%
you representative ger thank you madam
 
00:44:28.109 --> 00:44:28.119 align:start position:0%
chair uh so
 
00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:31.000 align:start position:0%
one of the you know we can see the
 
00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
consequence uh in in the case of
 
00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
landfill sighting rules uh is that you
 
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
know we've Fallen literally decades
 
00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
behind states around us and and and one
 
00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:43.240 align:start position:0%
of the questions which comes up
 
00:44:44.829 --> 00:44:44.839 align:start position:0%
frequently in our conversations with
 
00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:47.640 align:start position:0%
Dees or points of contention at times is
 
00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:49.720 align:start position:0%
is them saying well you know we're not
 
00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:51.880 align:start position:0%
going to comment on what they do in
 
00:44:54.589 --> 00:44:54.599 align:start position:0%
Maine or you know and on some level I
 
00:44:56.109 --> 00:44:56.119 align:start position:0%
understand that right I mean it is not
 
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
their role to be experts in Main's rules
 
00:45:04.549 --> 00:45:04.559 align:start position:0%
right but so could you speak to ideally
 
00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
how the balance should be struck
 
00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:10.720 align:start position:0%
between recognition that every state is
 
00:45:12.589 --> 00:45:12.599 align:start position:0%
going to do things differently and that
 
00:45:14.109 --> 00:45:14.119 align:start position:0%
they are Regulators for New Hampshire
 
00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
and not for
 
00:45:18.589 --> 00:45:18.599 align:start position:0%
Maine on the one hand with the fact that
 
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
we are impacted by that enormous
 
00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:25.000 align:start position:0%
differential by states around us so how
 
00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
is that balance struck between the unque
 
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
qualities of one State's rules and the
 
00:45:34.349 --> 00:45:34.359 align:start position:0%
need to fit into the rules that are
 
00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:37.480 align:start position:0%
prevalent in the states of the
 
00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
region so I'm going to answer your
 
00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:40.720 align:start position:0%
question but I'm going to start by
 
00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:43.000 align:start position:0%
saying I I I came here to talk about
 
00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:46.720 align:start position:0%
process and and and policy and and a
 
00:45:48.829 --> 00:45:48.839 align:start position:0%
framework so I I guess my first answer
 
00:45:48.839 --> 00:45:49.030 align:start position:0%
framework so I I guess my first answer
would

00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:50.150 align:start position:0%
would
[Music]

00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:45:53.549 --> 00:45:53.559 align:start position:0%
be if almost every state and and the
 
00:45:54.910 --> 00:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
federal system have been doing this for
 
00:45:57.309 --> 00:45:57.319 align:start position:0%
many decades there's just no
 
00:45:59.589 --> 00:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
justification for saying other than we
 
00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
just want to be different or you know I
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
guess they could say we think every
 
00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
other state is wrong and and Harry
 
00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:07.480 align:start position:0%
Truman was wrong and Ronald Reagan was
 
00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:08.920 align:start position:0%
wrong we have a better way but I've
 
00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:11.720 align:start position:0%
never heard that so I don't see any
 
00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
reason even if Maine was was different
 
00:46:17.710 --> 00:46:17.720 align:start position:0%
geologically I just don't see any reason
 
00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
why if if for decades it's been it's
 
00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
been working right the Public Public
 
00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:25.880 align:start position:0%
obviously does not feel happy about
 
00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:26.920 align:start position:0%
every rule the federal government
 
00:46:28.109 --> 00:46:28.119 align:start position:0%
government has put out or their state
 
00:46:32.910 --> 00:46:32.920 align:start position:0%
has put out but there is clearly much
 
00:46:38.309 --> 00:46:38.319 align:start position:0%
more um shall we say sort of you know
 
00:46:42.030 --> 00:46:42.040 align:start position:0%
resigned uh affirmation that we didn't
 
00:46:43.790 --> 00:46:43.800 align:start position:0%
get what we wanted but we we were heard
 
00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
we went through a process it all made
 
00:46:48.309 --> 00:46:48.319 align:start position:0%
sense we went to court we we had our
 
00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
data you know a judge said it's a close
 
00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
call but we I'm going to defer when you
 
00:46:55.630 --> 00:46:55.640 align:start position:0%
lose a fight like that you feel like
 
00:46:58.870 --> 00:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
okay you know win some lose some but I I
 
00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:02.680 align:start position:0%
just can't imagine that that if people
 
00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:04.470 align:start position:0%
just can't imagine that that if people
understood

00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
understood
 
00:47:08.309 --> 00:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
how how it's done elsewhere and how much
 
00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
more of a chance you get to make a
 
00:47:12.910 --> 00:47:12.920 align:start position:0%
case all through the process not just in
 
00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
court but you know speaking to and
 
00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
hearing from the people who work for you
 
00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
in these agencies they wouldn't be
 
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
satisfied with this perfunctory process
 
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.790 align:start position:0%
satisfied with this perfunctory process
now

00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:23.800 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:25.960 align:start position:0%
specifically you know should our rules
 
00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
look like other no I mean um we all have
 
00:47:30.589 --> 00:47:30.599 align:start position:0%
different speed limits we all have
 
00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:34.280 align:start position:0%
different uh degrees of uh you know
 
00:47:36.829 --> 00:47:36.839 align:start position:0%
California's typically been the uh the
 
00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:39.240 align:start position:0%
Vanguard and you know you have to the
 
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
big three now have to make their cars
 
00:47:42.549 --> 00:47:42.559 align:start position:0%
for the whole country because they they
 
00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:44.720 align:start position:0%
have to make them more efficient for
 
00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
California that you can like that or not
 
00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
like that but um there's no reason that
 
00:47:52.069 --> 00:47:52.079 align:start position:0%
our state couldn't be stricter in some
 
00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
ways and way less strict in other ways
 
00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
if it was reasoned if it was we've
 
00:47:58.349 --> 00:47:58.359 align:start position:0%
looked looked at everything and here
 
00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
here we know we're different and here's
 
00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
why and not just we're unique don't talk
 
00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:05.240 align:start position:0%
to me about that's that could be Alpha
 
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
centor for all I know I don't know about
 
00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
you thank you um so uh at the beginning
 
00:48:21.349 --> 00:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the that uh it's the way
 
00:48:23.790 --> 00:48:23.800 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire's administrative set
 
00:48:27.349 --> 00:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
structure is set up it is possible for
 
00:48:31.150 --> 00:48:31.160 align:start position:0%
uh one individual to have an out uh
 
00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
outweighted influence on the way that
 
00:48:38.910 --> 00:48:38.920 align:start position:0%
administrative rule is actually executed
 
00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:43.480 align:start position:0%
and uh what would need to change in so
 
00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
what what what barriers to that exist in
 
00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:47.870 align:start position:0%
what what what barriers to that exist in
other

00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
states I think everything I've been
 
00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:52.280 align:start position:0%
saying about I mean there there you can
 
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
obviously never legislate
 
00:48:58.710 --> 00:48:58.720 align:start position:0%
against impr prety illegality uh there
 
00:49:00.309 --> 00:49:00.319 align:start position:0%
are always going to be private meetings
 
00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:02.440 align:start position:0%
there always going to be and and know
 
00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
the president or the governor is always
 
00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
going to have the the right and the
 
00:49:08.549 --> 00:49:08.559 align:start position:0%
authority to to direct broad policy and
 
00:49:10.069 --> 00:49:10.079 align:start position:0%
and you know and that's that was kind of
 
00:49:12.069 --> 00:49:12.079 align:start position:0%
what I was trying to say earlier that
 
00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
the pendulum will swing but all of these
 
00:49:16.589 --> 00:49:16.599 align:start position:0%
procedures are designed so that it
 
00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:19.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't swing wildly and erratically
 
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
it's kind of in between you know the 20
 
00:49:24.109 --> 00:49:24.119 align:start position:0%
yard lines instead of way off uh you
 
00:49:26.069 --> 00:49:26.079 align:start position:0%
know into the other end zone and so yeah
 
00:49:27.589 --> 00:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
you're going to have new sheriff in town
 
00:49:29.710 --> 00:49:29.720 align:start position:0%
who will say for the next two years or
 
00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
four years I want things to be stricter
 
00:49:34.589 --> 00:49:34.599 align:start position:0%
I want things to be less strict uh but
 
00:49:37.630 --> 00:49:37.640 align:start position:0%
if you have a a system
 
00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
where you know I didn't even talk about
 
00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
this because I I'm not sure what new
 
00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
hampsh would want to do but there are
 
00:49:47.349 --> 00:49:47.359 align:start position:0%
there are there are penalties in other
 
00:49:49.829 --> 00:49:49.839 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions for having once the clock
 
00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:51.240 align:start position:0%
starts and you're supposed to be
 
00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:53.720 align:start position:0%
listening to everyone uh it's called
 
00:49:55.549 --> 00:49:55.559 align:start position:0%
expart communication you're not supposed
 
00:49:57.710 --> 00:49:57.720 align:start position:0%
to invite either the industry or the
 
00:49:59.549 --> 00:49:59.559 align:start position:0%
Environmental Group in for a private
 
00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
session off the Record where where you
 
00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:04.720 align:start position:0%
negotiate things and come out with a
 
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
different rule that's illegal in some
 
00:50:10.270 --> 00:50:10.280 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions and again the difference
 
00:50:14.109 --> 00:50:14.119 align:start position:0%
between being heard in the sense of I
 
00:50:16.109 --> 00:50:16.119 align:start position:0%
was in the same room with the person I
 
00:50:17.710 --> 00:50:17.720 align:start position:0%
who works for me at at at the
 
00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
administrative agency so I got my five
 
00:50:23.309 --> 00:50:23.319 align:start position:0%
minutes in the room with that person
 
00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:25.640 align:start position:0%
versus I someone else was in a room with
 
00:50:28.309 --> 00:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
that person and and got to negotiate
 
00:50:30.270 --> 00:50:30.280 align:start position:0%
language and came out of that meeting
 
00:50:32.589 --> 00:50:32.599 align:start position:0%
with getting back to the phone to the to
 
00:50:34.750 --> 00:50:34.760 align:start position:0%
the client you know I negotiate you know
 
00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
I got it from 1 time 10us 3 to 5 time
 
00:50:40.309 --> 00:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
10us 3 on average for you you know I did
 
00:50:43.309 --> 00:50:43.319 align:start position:0%
I did my job today that's night and day
 
00:50:45.109 --> 00:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
you know it might have taken an hour in
 
00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
public and an hour in private but the
 
00:50:51.150 --> 00:50:51.160 align:start position:0%
entire uh structure and and AFF effect
 
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
of those two things is incredibly
 
00:50:54.750 --> 00:50:54.760 align:start position:0%
different and as you know we have it we
 
00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
have emails including one from former
 
00:50:59.109 --> 00:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
assistant Commissioner of Dees
 
00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
complaining to his Waste Management
 
00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
director are you getting as tired of
 
00:51:05.710 --> 00:51:05.720 align:start position:0%
being directed was the word he used in
 
00:51:08.950 --> 00:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
our rul making by uh an industry lawyer
 
00:51:11.470 --> 00:51:11.480 align:start position:0%
with a name as as we are I'm starting to
 
00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:15.720 align:start position:0%
get you know a little antsy about
 
00:51:17.349 --> 00:51:17.359 align:start position:0%
this thank
 
00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
you so that leads me to this question so
 
00:51:23.230 --> 00:51:23.240 align:start position:0%
in any of your time working uh in your
 
00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
history you've got Decades of experience
 
00:51:27.829 --> 00:51:27.839 align:start position:0%
did you work for an agent that ever was
 
00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:29.880 align:start position:0%
like writing rules that would apply to
 
00:51:34.030 --> 00:51:34.040 align:start position:0%
like many businesses but then um then
 
00:51:36.829 --> 00:51:36.839 align:start position:0%
specifically the numbers were engineered
 
00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:39.720 align:start position:0%
for maybe one specific purpose permit
 
00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
application pending have have you ever
 
00:51:44.670 --> 00:51:44.680 align:start position:0%
seen that in all your time and in all
 
00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:45.630 align:start position:0%
seen that in all your time and in all
your

00:51:45.630 --> 00:51:45.640 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:48.520 align:start position:0%
experience short answer is no it it it
 
00:51:50.910 --> 00:51:50.920 align:start position:0%
is and I've said this several times it
 
00:51:53.309 --> 00:51:53.319 align:start position:0%
is it is regrettable it is unfortunate I
 
00:51:55.270 --> 00:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
have some sympathy for Dees that they
 
00:51:57.309 --> 00:51:57.319 align:start position:0%
are in a position of having Ru making
 
00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
deadline at the same time as as one very
 
00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:03.720 align:start position:0%
stubborn company is not only saying we
 
00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:06.040 align:start position:0%
want our landfill in this tract and no
 
00:52:07.829 --> 00:52:07.839 align:start position:0%
other but they're saying we want it now
 
00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
and not later so they ha they
 
00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunately have to and they're under
 
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
staff so the same three people maybe
 
00:52:17.069 --> 00:52:17.079 align:start position:0%
it's six people but part of their day
 
00:52:18.309 --> 00:52:18.319 align:start position:0%
they're writing the rule and part of
 
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
their day they're reading this
 
00:52:23.109 --> 00:52:23.119 align:start position:0%
application but the data I'm convinced
 
00:52:25.549 --> 00:52:25.559 align:start position:0%
that the data in the application has
 
00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:28.640 align:start position:0%
been cut cut and pasted into the rule
 
00:52:32.190 --> 00:52:32.200 align:start position:0%
and that is highly improper that is day
 
00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:40.240 align:start position:0%
that representative Gera thank you uh so
 
00:52:42.549 --> 00:52:42.559 align:start position:0%
you brought up a a point a few minutes
 
00:52:44.349 --> 00:52:44.359 align:start position:0%
ago that I want to kind of lean in on a
 
00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
little bit and and that is you know we
 
00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
have seen with these rules as they were
 
00:52:52.390 --> 00:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
drafted in in the various iterations
 
00:52:55.069 --> 00:52:55.079 align:start position:0%
that in the initial draft we had a
 
00:52:57.549 --> 00:52:57.559 align:start position:0%
standard 1 time 10 to than 5th which was
 
00:53:00.109 --> 00:53:00.119 align:start position:0%
equivalent to what they have in Maine
 
00:53:02.670 --> 00:53:02.680 align:start position:0%
that by the second draft had been
 
00:53:06.109 --> 00:53:06.119 align:start position:0%
knocked down to what it is now 1 time
 
00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
104 and the feedback that we received
 
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
was that they had heard from industry
 
00:53:14.349 --> 00:53:14.359 align:start position:0%
that this was this was an unworkable
 
00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
number so my question is as someone with
 
00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
your experience what kind of red flags
 
00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
does it raise when you see that kind of
 
00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
change number one and number two
 
00:53:30.430 --> 00:53:30.440 align:start position:0%
two what kind of evidence would you
 
00:53:32.430 --> 00:53:32.440 align:start position:0%
expect to see to support that change
 
00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
because it's certainly possible that
 
00:53:36.190 --> 00:53:36.200 align:start position:0%
there is evidence that could be
 
00:53:37.990 --> 00:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
presented that would demonstrate that
 
00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:40.160 align:start position:0%
this change makes sense right but what
 
00:53:42.789 --> 00:53:42.799 align:start position:0%
kinds of evidence as a regulator would
 
00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
you expect to see when that kind of
 
00:53:48.910 --> 00:53:48.920 align:start position:0%
weakening change is made in the draft of
 
00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
rules so it's it's it's a two-part
 
00:53:53.549 --> 00:53:53.559 align:start position:0%
answer first of all the the amount of
 
00:53:56.750 --> 00:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
angst and and dismay uh the that I would
 
00:53:59.549 --> 00:53:59.559 align:start position:0%
feel would depend on you know how much
 
00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
weakened and and and how much further
 
00:54:04.230 --> 00:54:04.240 align:start position:0%
out of the mainstream I mean I I make no
 
00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
apologies I look
 
00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
at I've I've sent to everybody a list of
 
00:54:11.390 --> 00:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
I think 27 states countries provinces
 
00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
and they're all way over here and New
 
00:54:15.430 --> 00:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's way over here and and
 
00:54:18.589 --> 00:54:18.599 align:start position:0%
getting further out so yeah if if if you
 
00:54:20.589 --> 00:54:20.599 align:start position:0%
have a private meeting and you come away
 
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
with you know 10% more away from the
 
00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
mainstream but still in the plausible
 
00:54:27.829 --> 00:54:27.839 align:start position:0%
range okay that's one but starting from
 
00:54:30.109 --> 00:54:30.119 align:start position:0%
a a ludicrous position and then going
 
00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:32.240 align:start position:0%
five times worse and five times worse
 
00:54:34.589 --> 00:54:34.599 align:start position:0%
and then changing the wording so that it
 
00:54:36.430 --> 00:54:36.440 align:start position:0%
it could be any number of times worse
 
00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
you know that's a that's
 
00:54:40.990 --> 00:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
a neon red
 
00:54:45.829 --> 00:54:45.839 align:start position:0%
flag um evidence so I think in this room
 
00:54:47.589 --> 00:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
you you heard you asked this you
 
00:54:49.789 --> 00:54:49.799 align:start position:0%
personally asked do director whims that
 
00:54:52.270 --> 00:54:52.280 align:start position:0%
the same question and he forthrightly
 
00:54:55.270 --> 00:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
said we have no we we were not given any
 
00:54:56.950 --> 00:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
evidence we were we this was an
 
00:54:59.829 --> 00:54:59.839 align:start position:0%
assertion that was made and I I I think
 
00:55:01.710 --> 00:55:01.720 align:start position:0%
his implication was we we chose to
 
00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:03.880 align:start position:0%
accept that assertion without evidence
 
00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:06.400 align:start position:0%
and without any plans to collect
 
00:55:09.190 --> 00:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
evidence and you know I would say in
 
00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
addition to the impropriety of that uh
 
00:55:14.710 --> 00:55:14.720 align:start position:0%
there is a a vast literature and vast
 
00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
amount of common sense that says
 
00:55:17.789 --> 00:55:17.799 align:start position:0%
industry will
 
00:55:20.589 --> 00:55:20.599 align:start position:0%
always claim the sky is falling the the
 
00:55:22.430 --> 00:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
estimates of how much things are will
 
00:55:24.829 --> 00:55:24.839 align:start position:0%
cost are always exaggerated partly
 
00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
because they do get cheaper over time
 
00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
but partly because it's it's it's
 
00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
strategy you you say that it's
 
00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
impossible in the hopes that you won't
 
00:55:35.470 --> 00:55:35.480 align:start position:0%
be asked to do what's possible and a
 
00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
good regulator would would understand
 
00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:40.720 align:start position:0%
that instinctively and not just well but
 
00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
they said
 
00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
so it was a not a good
 
00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
day representative H
 
00:55:52.670 --> 00:55:52.680 align:start position:0%
Haskins so are you saying Dr fle that um
 
00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:54.150 align:start position:0%
Haskins so are you saying Dr fle that um
this

00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:55:58.829 --> 00:55:58.839 align:start position:0%
rule the central CR creran is 500 to 50
 
00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:02.720 align:start position:0%
times weaker than every other
 
00:56:05.029 --> 00:56:05.039 align:start position:0%
regulation uh I don't have my notes I
 
00:56:08.190 --> 00:56:08.200 align:start position:0%
believe it's 500 to 50,000 times words
 
00:56:09.430 --> 00:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
depending on the jurisdiction there is
 
00:56:11.670 --> 00:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
nothing there I've not and I wrote in my
 
00:56:14.029 --> 00:56:14.039 align:start position:0%
comments if somebody wants to say it's
 
00:56:16.309 --> 00:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
not the this weakest on the planet it's
 
00:56:17.789 --> 00:56:17.799 align:start position:0%
the second or the third or the fourth
 
00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
weakest or the 10th weakest apologies
 
00:56:21.789 --> 00:56:21.799 align:start position:0%
for me and I'll I'll change my rhetoric
 
00:56:24.990 --> 00:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
but I found nothing within a factor of
 
00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
500 of and many that are 50,000 times
 
00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:32.720 align:start position:0%
stricter in states which of course have
 
00:56:34.829 --> 00:56:34.839 align:start position:0%
thriving landfill industry so back to
 
00:56:36.990 --> 00:56:37.000 align:start position:0%
your question you know the the common
 
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:37.910 align:start position:0%
your question you know the the common
sense

00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
sense
 
00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:40.440 align:start position:0%
is all the evidence goes in the in the
 
00:56:41.950 --> 00:56:41.960 align:start position:0%
other direction not only do they not
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
have evidence the sky is falling but
 
00:56:45.309 --> 00:56:45.319 align:start position:0%
they have evidence that the sky is not
 
00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:47.480 align:start position:0%
falling across this border and that
 
00:56:48.789 --> 00:56:48.799 align:start position:0%
border and that
 
00:56:50.829 --> 00:56:50.839 align:start position:0%
border thank
 
00:56:55.069 --> 00:56:55.079 align:start position:0%
you uh so have you watched all of our
 
00:56:57.710 --> 00:56:57.720 align:start position:0%
subcommittee here hearings
 
00:57:00.069 --> 00:57:00.079 align:start position:0%
every riveting
 
00:57:02.910 --> 00:57:02.920 align:start position:0%
moment so if you could pick out maybe
 
00:57:05.390 --> 00:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
the top or the top three things that
 
00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
stand out in regards with all of the
 
00:57:11.029 --> 00:57:11.039 align:start position:0%
hearings that we've had on on this rule
 
00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:13.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittee what would you tell
 
00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
us well the first one that comes to mind
 
00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
I haven't I didn't mention it yet is uh
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
Mr Morel uh who came and spoke to you
 
00:57:21.829 --> 00:57:21.839 align:start position:0%
about the rule making process in New
 
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it was a beautiful you
 
00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
know cogent
 
00:57:29.589 --> 00:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
description you know he's much more
 
00:57:31.230 --> 00:57:31.240 align:start position:0%
expert in New Hampshire than I am but I
 
00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
I would assume he made not a single
 
00:57:35.789 --> 00:57:35.799 align:start position:0%
error of of any kind it was a completely
 
00:57:38.549 --> 00:57:38.559 align:start position:0%
perfect description of what happens here
 
00:57:40.349 --> 00:57:40.359 align:start position:0%
and I would just say that to me stuck
 
00:57:43.630 --> 00:57:43.640 align:start position:0%
out because this gentleman who obviously
 
00:57:45.630 --> 00:57:45.640 align:start position:0%
is is incredibly well trained and has
 
00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
you know devoted his life to this
 
00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
understands the environment in this fish
 
00:57:54.029 --> 00:57:54.039 align:start position:0%
tank and and and maybe doesn't
 
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
understand or just doesn't seem feel
 
00:57:57.670 --> 00:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
that it's that it's important or
 
00:58:00.029 --> 00:58:00.039 align:start position:0%
relevant to say this is our process but
 
00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
we exist in a in a larger ocean in which
 
00:58:04.789 --> 00:58:04.799 align:start position:0%
it's very different when you go outside
 
00:58:07.150 --> 00:58:07.160 align:start position:0%
the tank and see how it's done elsewhere
 
00:58:10.349 --> 00:58:10.359 align:start position:0%
so you know that that struck me as just
 
00:58:12.510 --> 00:58:12.520 align:start position:0%
you know it would never change because
 
00:58:15.390 --> 00:58:15.400 align:start position:0%
it is a it is in internally perfect
 
00:58:17.549 --> 00:58:17.559 align:start position:0%
system it works exactly as it was
 
00:58:20.190 --> 00:58:20.200 align:start position:0%
intended but somebody needs to step back
 
00:58:22.829 --> 00:58:22.839 align:start position:0%
and say the statute has been updated you
 
00:58:24.990 --> 00:58:25.000 align:start position:0%
know Harry Truman updated it for the you
 
00:58:27.630 --> 00:58:27.640 align:start position:0%
know could it be intended to work
 
00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
differently and then work as intended in
 
00:58:32.190 --> 00:58:32.200 align:start position:0%
a in a different way uh I think mural
 
00:58:35.069 --> 00:58:35.079 align:start position:0%
robinette's testimony was was terrific
 
00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
um you know she's much more the
 
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologist than I am and and
 
00:58:41.309 --> 00:58:41.319 align:start position:0%
explained in in great detail you know I
 
00:58:43.349 --> 00:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
think she and I both believe again that
 
00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:46.720 align:start position:0%
not only is the rule full of weird
 
00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
ludicrous numbers that just jump out at
 
00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
you as as coming out of fantasy land but
 
00:58:54.390 --> 00:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
there are things missing and what she
 
00:58:56.670 --> 00:58:56.680 align:start position:0%
said I think that's that that should
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
have hit home is uh that nothing in
 
00:59:02.910 --> 00:59:02.920 align:start position:0%
these rules contemplates the applicant
 
00:59:05.109 --> 00:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
really studying the entire site they're
 
00:59:07.109 --> 00:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
supposed to study the first five feet of
 
00:59:09.390 --> 00:59:09.400 align:start position:0%
the site in in vertical Direction and
 
00:59:11.470 --> 00:59:11.480 align:start position:0%
when people are drawing water from a
 
00:59:14.789 --> 00:59:14.799 align:start position:0%
gigantic aquafer 300 feet below grade
 
00:59:17.470 --> 00:59:17.480 align:start position:0%
and the the applicant is not in
 
00:59:19.589 --> 00:59:19.599 align:start position:0%
instructed to even think about that and
 
00:59:21.710 --> 00:59:21.720 align:start position:0%
Dees is clearly you know not in a
 
00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
position to say oh you didn't provide us
 
00:59:25.630 --> 00:59:25.640 align:start position:0%
that so we'll go out we'll we'll walk
 
00:59:27.029 --> 00:59:27.039 align:start position:0%
onto the site and do it ourselves
 
00:59:29.349 --> 00:59:29.359 align:start position:0%
they're not going to do that so they
 
00:59:31.109 --> 00:59:31.119 align:start position:0%
have described the skin of an onion and
 
00:59:32.589 --> 00:59:32.599 align:start position:0%
they don't know whether there's an onion
 
00:59:35.029 --> 00:59:35.039 align:start position:0%
underneath it or a time bomb it's
 
00:59:38.190 --> 00:59:38.200 align:start position:0%
just I put Terra Incognito we have no we
 
00:59:40.029 --> 00:59:40.039 align:start position:0%
have no idea and the rule the new rules
 
00:59:41.549 --> 00:59:41.559 align:start position:0%
that are supposed to be the grand
 
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
updating do nothing to improve that
 
00:59:46.309 --> 00:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
situation and I would just say you asked
 
00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
for three so I would just say the the
 
00:59:51.829 --> 00:59:51.839 align:start position:0%
admission from Mr whim that that that
 
00:59:53.789 --> 00:59:53.799 align:start position:0%
they've been told it would be impossible
 
00:59:56.589 --> 00:59:56.599 align:start position:0%
to make these rules stronger
 
00:59:59.069 --> 00:59:59.079 align:start position:0%
and what evidence we have none and have
 
01:00:01.710 --> 01:00:01.720 align:start position:0%
you even thought about how it's beled by
 
01:00:04.109 --> 01:00:04.119 align:start position:0%
the experience of states in the region
 
01:00:05.950 --> 01:00:05.960 align:start position:0%
that have strict rules and and thriving
 
01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
Industries and are sending their trash
 
01:00:11.549 --> 01:00:11.559 align:start position:0%
to us because uh you know they choose to
 
01:00:16.510 --> 01:00:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:18.870 --> 01:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
all so I have one more question and I
 
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
wantan to I want to give you the
 
01:00:23.109 --> 01:00:23.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to kind of wrap up if
 
01:00:25.029 --> 01:00:25.039 align:start position:0%
there's something that you missed and um
 
01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
you know we're willing to go over a few
 
01:00:30.549 --> 01:00:30.559 align:start position:0%
minutes just because it started late
 
01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
um have you okay so I watched the the
 
01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:39.960 align:start position:0%
rules um with Dees um public hearing and
 
01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
I know many people were there there
 
01:00:45.710 --> 01:00:45.720 align:start position:0%
weren't um there weren't any that were
 
01:00:48.910 --> 01:00:48.920 align:start position:0%
there saying wow these are these are
 
01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
great um there was only opposition and
 
01:00:54.029 --> 01:00:54.039 align:start position:0%
do you you know do you have any further
 
01:00:56.150 --> 01:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
comments about that in just in regards
 
01:00:59.109 --> 01:00:59.119 align:start position:0%
with your experience in the process that
 
01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
you could just um because you know I
 
01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:03.960 align:start position:0%
would love people to hear this you know
 
01:01:06.549 --> 01:01:06.559 align:start position:0%
to listen to this afterwards but um you
 
01:01:08.430 --> 01:01:08.440 align:start position:0%
know any advice that you could give
 
01:01:10.510 --> 01:01:10.520 align:start position:0%
moving forward especially you know
 
01:01:12.109 --> 01:01:12.119 align:start position:0%
whether it be to the department whether
 
01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
it to be to JL car whether it be to the
 
01:01:18.549 --> 01:01:18.559 align:start position:0%
legislature yeah I was I was a I didn't
 
01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
know what I've been to these hearings
 
01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
before but I I you know I even wrote to
 
01:01:23.910 --> 01:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
Dees in advance and said how much time
 
01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
will people get you know do you have any
 
01:01:27.630 --> 01:01:27.640 align:start position:0%
sense of you know 3 hours divided by n
 
01:01:30.430 --> 01:01:30.440 align:start position:0%
is you know 5 seconds per person or I I
 
01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
had no idea and then there were I think
 
01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
probably 20 people including a couple of
 
01:01:37.870 --> 01:01:37.880 align:start position:0%
of you came to uh to testify and yes
 
01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
zero support for these rules now that
 
01:01:44.950 --> 01:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
tells me two things one when director
 
01:01:47.390 --> 01:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
whims says we have look I was a
 
01:01:49.950 --> 01:01:49.960 align:start position:0%
bureaucrat we love to say we must be
 
01:01:51.309 --> 01:01:51.319 align:start position:0%
doing something right if everyone's
 
01:01:53.230 --> 01:01:53.240 align:start position:0%
unhappy well that that makes no sense I
 
01:01:54.430 --> 01:01:54.440 align:start position:0%
mean you can you can make everyone
 
01:01:57.309 --> 01:01:57.319 align:start position:0%
unhappy by by being clumsy and awkward
 
01:01:59.549 --> 01:01:59.559 align:start position:0%
and illegal and you know so that's not a
 
01:02:02.309 --> 01:02:02.319 align:start position:0%
good Criterion but is everybody unhappy
 
01:02:03.870 --> 01:02:03.880 align:start position:0%
I don't think so
 
01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
because the most affected what he calls
 
01:02:08.589 --> 01:02:08.599 align:start position:0%
the most affected people are clearly
 
01:02:10.269 --> 01:02:10.279 align:start position:0%
happy because they had their one
 
01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity to say that they weren't and
 
01:02:15.069 --> 01:02:15.079 align:start position:0%
none of them showed up
 
01:02:18.150 --> 01:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
so you know I I only I I can think of
 
01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:20.680 align:start position:0%
and makes perfect sense to me why would
 
01:02:23.950 --> 01:02:23.960 align:start position:0%
someone come who had a hand in writing
 
01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
every word of this rule other than to
 
01:02:29.710 --> 01:02:29.720 align:start position:0%
sayg great job you know don't change
 
01:02:32.510 --> 01:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
your that doesn't look right you can't
 
01:02:36.069 --> 01:02:36.079 align:start position:0%
come to a process and say somehow wink
 
01:02:37.589 --> 01:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
wink you've done a great job I wouldn't
 
01:02:39.670 --> 01:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
change a word so there was nothing to
 
01:02:41.950 --> 01:02:41.960 align:start position:0%
say and I have I've never seen that now
 
01:02:45.230 --> 01:02:45.240 align:start position:0%
we knew in the federal system that that
 
01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
we were trying to strike a balance
 
01:02:49.589 --> 01:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
because we had the White House in
 
01:02:50.789 --> 01:02:50.799 align:start position:0%
Democratic and Republican
 
01:02:52.750 --> 01:02:52.760 align:start position:0%
administrations you know riding Herd on
 
01:02:55.069 --> 01:02:55.079 align:start position:0%
us to make it cheaper and and and less
 
01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
protective so we knew the Unions would
 
01:02:58.069 --> 01:02:58.079 align:start position:0%
always Sue and we knew that business
 
01:03:00.589 --> 01:03:00.599 align:start position:0%
would always Sue it it's just the way it
 
01:03:03.269 --> 01:03:03.279 align:start position:0%
was and we didn't take it personally we
 
01:03:05.150 --> 01:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
knew that the the first five years we're
 
01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
writing it the next three years we're
 
01:03:08.069 --> 01:03:08.079 align:start position:0%
defending it in court and God willing
 
01:03:09.670 --> 01:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
we'd come out after eight years with a
 
01:03:11.950 --> 01:03:11.960 align:start position:0%
rule that was was enforceable we got
 
01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:14.200 align:start position:0%
sued over that healthc care provider the
 
01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:16.640 align:start position:0%
AMA sued Us in in a heartbeat how dare
 
01:03:20.029 --> 01:03:20.039 align:start position:0%
you let nurses and PAs uh take some of
 
01:03:22.190 --> 01:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
our and we won the case but we had to go
 
01:03:28.190 --> 01:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
is there anything else that you'd like
 
01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
to add to kind in two minutes or less
 
01:03:34.510 --> 01:03:34.520 align:start position:0%
I'll just say uh I I brought uh a couple
 
01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
of copies so this uh report that we did
 
01:03:39.789 --> 01:03:39.799 align:start position:0%
at pen of a multi-year project uh has a
 
01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:42.760 align:start position:0%
a short summary it has a a large report
 
01:03:44.950 --> 01:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
it has a book for the cameras called
 
01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
achieving regulatory excellence and my
 
01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
my boss and and colleague Carrie colines
 
01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
he has continued to write books about
 
01:03:55.829 --> 01:03:55.839 align:start position:0%
this and reports uh ever since and I
 
01:03:57.390 --> 01:03:57.400 align:start position:0%
just want to quote uh from his words
 
01:03:59.349 --> 01:03:59.359 align:start position:0%
because he's a great writer he said
 
01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
regulating is hard work just doing it
 
01:04:03.829 --> 01:04:03.839 align:start position:0%
well is demanding and difficult to
 
01:04:05.470 --> 01:04:05.480 align:start position:0%
achieve Excellence at regulating
 
01:04:07.230 --> 01:04:07.240 align:start position:0%
requires still more it requires
 
01:04:08.990 --> 01:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
consistently and
 
01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:11.160 align:start position:0%
superlatively mastering all of the
 
01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:13.160 align:start position:0%
technical analytic and social task
 
01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
needed to solve public problems so in
 
01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
the in the lower left this again is
 
01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
car's uh work he called it the the regx
 
01:04:23.309 --> 01:04:23.319 align:start position:0%
the regulatory Excellence molecule and
 
01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
it's got three parts uh kind of a ver an
 
01:04:29.950 --> 01:04:29.960 align:start position:0%
adjective and a and a noun I guess maybe
 
01:04:33.349 --> 01:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
a verb but talks about utmost integrity
 
01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
and so the you know the maybe it's an
 
01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
adverb I don't know you English teachers
 
01:04:39.549 --> 01:04:39.559 align:start position:0%
uh not just some Integrity but you know
 
01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
you have to be really uh willing to to
 
01:04:46.510 --> 01:04:46.520 align:start position:0%
not Stray From the Path so it's it's uh
 
01:04:49.470 --> 01:04:49.480 align:start position:0%
the quality of the process it's the
 
01:04:52.150 --> 01:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
fairness of the process it's not having
 
01:04:54.549 --> 01:04:54.559 align:start position:0%
private meetings it's not uh playing
 
01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
Candy Crush on your phone when the
 
01:04:58.510 --> 01:04:58.520 align:start position:0%
public is trying to explain that they're
 
01:05:00.789 --> 01:05:00.799 align:start position:0%
AF afraid right or wrong for their
 
01:05:02.910 --> 01:05:02.920 align:start position:0%
health or for their ecosystem or for
 
01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
their view or whatever it is uh it's
 
01:05:08.950 --> 01:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
empathic engagement it's not
 
01:05:11.549 --> 01:05:11.559 align:start position:0%
just sighing deeply and saying we'll
 
01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
listen to you for an hour you know how
 
01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:16.799 align:start position:0%
much longer is this going to take
 
01:05:19.589 --> 01:05:19.599 align:start position:0%
um uh I'm not a psychologist my my wife
 
01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
is I know that representative H Haskins
 
01:05:24.349 --> 01:05:24.359 align:start position:0%
is a counseling background um I didn't
 
01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
know about this term until I worked on
 
01:05:28.829 --> 01:05:28.839 align:start position:0%
this project but it's called apparency
 
01:05:31.150 --> 01:05:31.160 align:start position:0%
transparency is important you can't
 
01:05:33.549 --> 01:05:33.559 align:start position:0%
function without transparency but what
 
01:05:35.190 --> 01:05:35.200 align:start position:0%
we learned I'll show you the the last
 
01:05:37.109 --> 01:05:37.119 align:start position:0%
slide can't read it but it's a poster on
 
01:05:39.630 --> 01:05:39.640 align:start position:0%
the wall uh we had
 
01:05:43.269 --> 01:05:43.279 align:start position:0%
a two-day meeting with with First Nation
 
01:05:45.510 --> 01:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
people in Canada about their regulatory
 
01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
Acy the energy regulator in Alberta and
 
01:05:49.789 --> 01:05:49.799 align:start position:0%
so they wrote things on the on the board
 
01:05:52.230 --> 01:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
about what they thought about the the
 
01:05:54.069 --> 01:05:54.079 align:start position:0%
agency that was putting you know the tar
 
01:05:55.950 --> 01:05:55.960 align:start position:0%
Sands into development and you know a
 
01:05:59.150 --> 01:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
lot of serious issues up there and and
 
01:06:00.510 --> 01:06:00.520 align:start position:0%
and yet all that they really were
 
01:06:02.870 --> 01:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
telling us was yeah we have to have
 
01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:04.799 align:start position:0%
transparency we can't have you know
 
01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
right to no requests ignored U that goes
 
01:06:09.150 --> 01:06:09.160 align:start position:0%
without saying but what we want is
 
01:06:12.670 --> 01:06:12.680 align:start position:0%
apparency we we want to understand if
 
01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
something's being done to us we want to
 
01:06:17.549 --> 01:06:17.559 align:start position:0%
understand why and if we get a a a
 
01:06:19.990 --> 01:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
credible answer maybe we're even willing
 
01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
to go back to our homes and live with
 
01:06:25.150 --> 01:06:25.160 align:start position:0%
what we think is a weak rule or no rule
 
01:06:27.829 --> 01:06:27.839 align:start position:0%
or a rule if if they will just do us the
 
01:06:30.349 --> 01:06:30.359 align:start position:0%
courtesy of explaining here's what we
 
01:06:32.150 --> 01:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
heard here's what we're balancing here's
 
01:06:35.430 --> 01:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
what the evidence says and we know we're
 
01:06:37.190 --> 01:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
creating winners and losers but that's
 
01:06:40.190 --> 01:06:40.200 align:start position:0%
our that's our job I I really do believe
 
01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
that that citizens or industry can go
 
01:06:44.950 --> 01:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
home at the end of that process and say
 
01:06:47.269 --> 01:06:47.279 align:start position:0%
we were heard we didn't we didn't get it
 
01:06:49.069 --> 01:06:49.079 align:start position:0%
all we maybe we would get didn't get any
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
of it but it's the way government should
 
01:06:55.589 --> 01:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
work and again without being um cynical
 
01:06:58.430 --> 01:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
or offensive I move back to the state
 
01:07:00.269 --> 01:07:00.279 align:start position:0%
and I don't see it working here and it
 
01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
it bothers me because it can work and it
 
01:07:04.950 --> 01:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
and it has to work so thank you thank
 
01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
you Dr
 
01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
finle yeah thank you so much for for
 
01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
your time and um and your engagement and
 
01:07:15.029 --> 01:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
um I guess we're officially I close I
 
01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
can close the hearing I don't have a a
 
01:07:19.990 --> 01:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
gavel I'm not that I can knock though so
 
01:07:37.109 --> 01:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:19.749 --> 01:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:22.789 --> 01:08:22.799 align:start position:0%
that are in in study I think
 
01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:28.990 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:28.990 --> 01:08:34.189 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:08:34.189 --> 01:08:34.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:38.110 --> 01:08:38.120 align:start position:0%
stud 1614 I think but I'll check that it
 
01:08:42.669 --> 01:08:42.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:42.679 --> 01:08:45.189 align:start position:0%
 
Ms

01:08:45.189 --> 01:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
Ms
 
01:08:49.110 --> 01:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah chairman ly just
 
01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
just he had one point I I think we made
 
01:08:53.950 --> 01:08:53.960 align:start position:0%
a drafting error at something about the
 
01:09:24.349 --> 01:09:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:25.510 --> 01:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I think we're probably okay yeah
 
01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:54.229 align:start position:0%
yeah I think we're probably okay yeah
like

01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:54.239 --> 01:11:24.229 align:start position:0%
 
everything

01:11:24.229 --> 01:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:12.350 --> 01:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:24.149 --> 01:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:57.510 --> 01:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:59.590 --> 01:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
since we had a subcommittee meeting this
 
01:13:02.110 --> 01:13:02.120 align:start position:0%
morning and I figured uh you know a good
 
01:13:05.470 --> 01:13:05.480 align:start position:0%
portion of were some members of our um
 
01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
uh environment agriculture committee
 
01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
were going to be here uh I thought it
 
01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate for us to gather uh
 
01:13:16.110 --> 01:13:16.120 align:start position:0%
briefly and just discuss a game plan for
 
01:13:18.910 --> 01:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
these uh three interim study bills which
 
01:13:22.510 --> 01:13:22.520 align:start position:0%
we still have uh in front of us and
 
01:13:25.709 --> 01:13:25.719 align:start position:0%
those three bills are HB 1351
 
01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the sale and use of adhesive
 
01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
baseed rodent traps HB 1685 redefining
 
01:13:33.870 --> 01:13:33.880 align:start position:0%
Homestead Foods as Artisan Foods
 
01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
creating excuse me an artisan food
 
01:13:38.510 --> 01:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
operations exemption establishing
 
01:13:40.709 --> 01:13:40.719 align:start position:0%
Artisan food products sales venues and
 
01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
allowing the production and sale of
 
01:13:45.149 --> 01:13:45.159 align:start position:0%
artisan food products requiring
 
01:13:49.070 --> 01:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
Refrigeration as well as HB 1170
 
01:13:51.310 --> 01:13:51.320 align:start position:0%
requiring public benefit and Community
 
01:13:53.629 --> 01:13:53.639 align:start position:0%
impact assessments from the Department
 
01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services
 
01:13:57.510 --> 01:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
now our committee
 
01:14:01.470 --> 01:14:01.480 align:start position:0%
um uh voted those three bills uh to go
 
01:14:05.229 --> 01:14:05.239 align:start position:0%
to interim study and they were uh voted
 
01:14:09.229 --> 01:14:09.239 align:start position:0%
to go by the Full House as well so we
 
01:14:11.310 --> 01:14:11.320 align:start position:0%
have these three bills ahead of us now
 
01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
we cannot vote on uh interim study bills
 
01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
today we are expected to have some sort
 
01:14:24.709 --> 01:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
of uh subcommittees work on these three
 
01:14:24.719 --> 01:14:26.070 align:start position:0%
of uh subcommittees work on these three
bills

01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
bills
 
01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
in one way shape or form and in the fall
 
01:14:33.510 --> 01:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
we as a committee would then convene to
 
01:14:36.590 --> 01:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
decide whether or not to
 
01:14:39.430 --> 01:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
recommend uh either for each of these
 
01:14:42.669 --> 01:14:42.679 align:start position:0%
bills either to uh that the
 
01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
recommendation would be for further
 
01:14:48.229 --> 01:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
legislation or no further
 
01:14:52.830 --> 01:14:52.840 align:start position:0%
legislation um so with that uh I'd like
 
01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
to um just
 
01:15:00.669 --> 01:15:00.679 align:start position:0%
discuss a game plan we can um for each
 
01:15:03.390 --> 01:15:03.400 align:start position:0%
of these bills have a subcommittee work
 
01:15:07.910 --> 01:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
on them we can start working uh in June
 
01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
now here uh um not today but uh we would
 
01:15:14.790 --> 01:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
have the subcommittees work on these
 
01:15:18.149 --> 01:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
throughout the summer um could have one
 
01:15:21.030 --> 01:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
meeting two meetings as many as the
 
01:15:24.350 --> 01:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittee deems appropriate to deal
 
01:15:27.750 --> 01:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
with discussions on uh on these three
 
01:15:31.070 --> 01:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
bills so um I would like representative
 
01:15:33.189 --> 01:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
Bixby if you have any comment uh
 
01:15:34.669 --> 01:15:34.679 align:start position:0%
regarding inter room study on these
 
01:15:36.990 --> 01:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
bills I'd be happy to hear them all
 
01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
right so um well in terms of uh ability
 
01:15:42.470 --> 01:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
to work over them work on them over over
 
01:15:44.470 --> 01:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
the summer there are restrictions that
 
01:15:46.470 --> 01:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
the speaker puts on
 
01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
doing uh legislative business during the
 
01:15:52.709 --> 01:15:52.719 align:start position:0%
summer and I know that it has been a
 
01:15:55.070 --> 01:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
July has been pretty much right out and
 
01:15:58.270 --> 01:15:58.280 align:start position:0%
and uh and it's August has been somewhat
 
01:16:02.030 --> 01:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
more flexible but uh in the last last
 
01:16:04.189 --> 01:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
year it was kind of discouraged and I
 
01:16:06.110 --> 01:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
know we don't get mileage for July and
 
01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
August as well uh so um so I I think
 
01:16:13.350 --> 01:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
that I so we need so I think we need to
 
01:16:15.189 --> 01:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
think about these as either being you
 
01:16:17.390 --> 01:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
know we work on them in the next two
 
01:16:19.629 --> 01:16:19.639 align:start position:0%
weeks or we work on them starting in
 
01:16:21.750 --> 01:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
September I think that's that that is in
 
01:16:24.870 --> 01:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
terms of the way that our constru
 
01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
straints are set up I think that's
 
01:16:29.390 --> 01:16:29.400 align:start position:0%
probably a better way to think about it
 
01:16:35.990 --> 01:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
um and uh so my feeling is um I'm not
 
01:16:38.189 --> 01:16:38.199 align:start position:0%
ready to work on these in the next two
 
01:16:38.199 --> 01:16:40.350 align:start position:0%
ready to work on these in the next two
weeks

01:16:40.350 --> 01:16:40.360 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
01:16:44.189 --> 01:16:44.199 align:start position:0%
so fair enough so so so that that's
 
01:16:46.350 --> 01:16:46.360 align:start position:0%
that's my sort of the overall impression
 
01:16:47.830 --> 01:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
and then we can get down to discussing
 
01:16:49.310 --> 01:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
the individual bills and I think we
 
01:16:52.310 --> 01:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
should just sort of I I think it makes
 
01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:53.669 align:start position:0%
should just sort of I I think it makes
sense

01:16:53.669 --> 01:16:53.679 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:16:57.350 --> 01:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
to um figure out uh is this something
 
01:17:00.870 --> 01:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
that we feel we really need to uh devote
 
01:17:04.590 --> 01:17:04.600 align:start position:0%
the work to and if so uh who is going to
 
01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:07.800 align:start position:0%
be taking the lead on that work uh and
 
01:17:10.149 --> 01:17:10.159 align:start position:0%
uh which doesn't mean and we have
 
01:17:12.390 --> 01:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
existing subcommittees and can generally
 
01:17:15.470 --> 01:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
fall to those existing subcommittees but
 
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh it doesn't mean that the chair of
 
01:17:18.629 --> 01:17:18.639 align:start position:0%
those subcommittees would necessarily be
 
01:17:22.030 --> 01:17:22.040 align:start position:0%
the person who was like doing the the
 
01:17:25.629 --> 01:17:25.639 align:start position:0%
the main thrust of uh pulling things
 
01:17:25.639 --> 01:17:26.870 align:start position:0%
the main thrust of uh pulling things
together

01:17:26.870 --> 01:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:17:30.990 --> 01:17:31.000 align:start position:0%
okay question question representative
 
01:17:33.870 --> 01:17:33.880 align:start position:0%
Penza so just asking about you know
 
01:17:36.790 --> 01:17:36.800 align:start position:0%
interm study bills and um you know being
 
01:17:39.310 --> 01:17:39.320 align:start position:0%
still well now I'm not a new rep anymore
 
01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
because this like in the second year but
 
01:17:44.110 --> 01:17:44.120 align:start position:0%
um I was told that you know I guess it
 
01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
depends on the level of people that want
 
01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
to be involved if they want to work on
 
01:17:51.070 --> 01:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
it over the summer and engagement um you
 
01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
know this the speaker can make an
 
01:17:56.310 --> 01:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
exception and has uh for some of these
 
01:17:57.990 --> 01:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
whether it be commissions and term
 
01:18:00.390 --> 01:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
studies you know so if reps are coming
 
01:18:04.270 --> 01:18:04.280 align:start position:0%
here um with mileage but so that is a
 
01:18:06.590 --> 01:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
possibility but it just depends on you
 
01:18:08.790 --> 01:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
know who really wants to be engaged so I
 
01:18:10.550 --> 01:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make that just I don't
 
01:18:12.990 --> 01:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
want to say you know we push it out that
 
01:18:15.110 --> 01:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
you know no one wants to work on this
 
01:18:16.950 --> 01:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
over the summer if we have people that
 
01:18:19.550 --> 01:18:19.560 align:start position:0%
want to we can we can ask the speaker
 
01:18:23.910 --> 01:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
for um for that so okay fair enough any
 
01:18:26.350 --> 01:18:26.360 align:start position:0%
other comment representative Howard I I
 
01:18:28.390 --> 01:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
just I just want to make it clear you
 
01:18:30.430 --> 01:18:30.440 align:start position:0%
know I know in a lot of a lot of
 
01:18:32.590 --> 01:18:32.600 align:start position:0%
committees they vote things into interim
 
01:18:34.390 --> 01:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
study and it's sort of like death With
 
01:18:38.629 --> 01:18:38.639 align:start position:0%
Dignity um and and I want to know that
 
01:18:42.790 --> 01:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
the bills that we deem worthy of looking
 
01:18:45.629 --> 01:18:45.639 align:start position:0%
further at as interim study that we
 
01:18:49.110 --> 01:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
indeed do the work um that we say that
 
01:18:51.709 --> 01:18:51.719 align:start position:0%
we're interested in doing otherwise why
 
01:18:55.110 --> 01:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
not just itl the bill you know so um I
 
01:18:57.310 --> 01:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm just I just feel it's very
 
01:18:59.430 --> 01:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
important that it's not a death With
 
01:19:03.110 --> 01:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
Dignity that these three bills we felt
 
01:19:06.510 --> 01:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
um were not ready for prime time we did
 
01:19:09.430 --> 01:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
not think that um the idea merited a
 
01:19:14.189 --> 01:19:14.199 align:start position:0%
total itl and um so here we are and I am
 
01:19:17.629 --> 01:19:17.639 align:start position:0%
glad to engage and and get these um
 
01:19:19.709 --> 01:19:19.719 align:start position:0%
these bills discussed a little bit more
 
01:19:22.350 --> 01:19:22.360 align:start position:0%
and and either recommend them for future
 
01:19:25.350 --> 01:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
legislation or not so um representative
 
01:19:27.870 --> 01:19:27.880 align:start position:0%
Howard I just have a technical question
 
01:19:30.870 --> 01:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
um is it an interm study is it just
 
01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
members of this
 
01:19:36.990 --> 01:19:37.000 align:start position:0%
committee yes yes but uh you can the
 
01:19:40.870 --> 01:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee can invite other members of
 
01:19:44.550 --> 01:19:44.560 align:start position:0%
the communities or stakeholders into to
 
01:19:47.390 --> 01:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
help discuss uh different aspects of the
 
01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
bill for instance I know with the uh
 
01:19:53.550 --> 01:19:53.560 align:start position:0%
Homestead Foods I am very interested in
 
01:19:56.310 --> 01:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
engaging convers ation with uh folks
 
01:20:00.470 --> 01:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
from DHHS Food Safety Division as well
 
01:20:03.950 --> 01:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
as um some of the farmers and people who
 
01:20:07.229 --> 01:20:07.239 align:start position:0%
operate Homestead Farms uh sell food off
 
01:20:10.750 --> 01:20:10.760 align:start position:0%
of their uh their different stands that
 
01:20:16.189 --> 01:20:16.199 align:start position:0%
they have and uh I have already um you
 
01:20:19.070 --> 01:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
know set an invitation for people to to
 
01:20:21.990 --> 01:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
come and discuss what their concerns and
 
01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
what their issues are that they'd like
 
01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
to see address with uh any further
 
01:20:29.550 --> 01:20:29.560 align:start position:0%
changes to food safety uh
 
01:20:32.270 --> 01:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
legislation so does that answer your
 
01:20:36.110 --> 01:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
question okay representative H Haskins
 
01:20:39.709 --> 01:20:39.719 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um with regard to
 
01:20:43.790 --> 01:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
1351 I am interested in the uh anti-glue
 
01:20:46.910 --> 01:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
trap bill and I have done preliminary
 
01:20:49.590 --> 01:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
research on it and I would be happy to
 
01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
take the lead if I could get someone to
 
01:20:54.229 --> 01:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
work with me I think that could be done
 
01:20:58.350 --> 01:20:58.360 align:start position:0%
uh shortly and then when I in regard to
 
01:21:00.430 --> 01:21:00.440 align:start position:0%
public benefit which I am supremely
 
01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
interested in as well I think that's
 
01:21:05.430 --> 01:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
going to take more time and effort so my
 
01:21:08.310 --> 01:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
own view is that that could uh wait
 
01:21:11.830 --> 01:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
until September when people are all
 
01:21:15.350 --> 01:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
around and we can get organized to do so
 
01:21:17.750 --> 01:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
okay well we we will discuss this
 
01:21:20.229 --> 01:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
morning as so far as which subcommittees
 
01:21:23.350 --> 01:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
we would um put this these different
 
01:21:26.590 --> 01:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
bills to representative P
 
01:21:32.629 --> 01:21:32.639 align:start position:0%
um hello ger I'm sorry pza ger yeah
 
01:21:36.830 --> 01:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
potato potato it's Italian these Italian
 
01:21:40.590 --> 01:21:40.600 align:start position:0%
names I'm so sorry than M pardon me um
 
01:21:43.390 --> 01:21:43.400 align:start position:0%
so I just like to speak very briefly
 
01:21:45.550 --> 01:21:45.560 align:start position:0%
about my interest in continuing work on
 
01:21:48.310 --> 01:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
1170 that was uh I worked with the
 
01:21:50.149 --> 01:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
sponsor the the prime sponsor
 
01:21:51.870 --> 01:21:51.880 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas on a couple of
 
01:21:55.350 --> 01:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
amendments and for those who may not uh
 
01:21:57.709 --> 01:21:57.719 align:start position:0%
remember it one of the issues with that
 
01:21:59.270 --> 01:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
was we simply didn't really have enough
 
01:22:01.629 --> 01:22:01.639 align:start position:0%
time to explore those amendments um and
 
01:22:04.189 --> 01:22:04.199 align:start position:0%
Dees didn't have an opportunity to
 
01:22:05.470 --> 01:22:05.480 align:start position:0%
explore them enough to be able to
 
01:22:07.590 --> 01:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
comment on them so we have a couple of
 
01:22:10.390 --> 01:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
amendments uh that we can really begin
 
01:22:12.030 --> 01:22:12.040 align:start position:0%
to work with I think whatever that
 
01:22:14.229 --> 01:22:14.239 align:start position:0%
timeline is if it's through the rest of
 
01:22:17.790 --> 01:22:17.800 align:start position:0%
June or picking up in September uh
 
01:22:19.550 --> 01:22:19.560 align:start position:0%
that's where we would begin work and
 
01:22:22.149 --> 01:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
consult with Dees uh and and try to
 
01:22:23.830 --> 01:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
refine those but we have a couple of
 
01:22:26.470 --> 01:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
amendments to to 1170 I think will be a
 
01:22:28.790 --> 01:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
good place for us to pick up on that
 
01:22:32.990 --> 01:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
bill okay representative Bixby yeah so
 
01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
um there's there's one other bill that
 
01:22:38.030 --> 01:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm blanking the number right now
 
01:22:42.229 --> 01:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
it's the bill on uh on um Extended
 
01:22:44.070 --> 01:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
producer responsibility which we had
 
01:22:46.149 --> 01:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
talked about uh doing an ad hoc
 
01:22:49.709 --> 01:22:49.719 align:start position:0%
committee study committee on that in um
 
01:22:51.110 --> 01:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
and I think that that's something that
 
01:22:54.110 --> 01:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
we also want to should should consider
 
01:22:57.390 --> 01:22:57.400 align:start position:0%
should make sure that we deal with uh in
 
01:22:59.750 --> 01:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
SE probably September okay well I'm not
 
01:23:04.110 --> 01:23:04.120 align:start position:0%
sure that we need to do that work
 
01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
because the solid waste working group is
 
01:23:11.270 --> 01:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
doing uh a lot of work right now on epr
 
01:23:14.430 --> 01:23:14.440 align:start position:0%
issues we're talking about um the
 
01:23:18.030 --> 01:23:18.040 align:start position:0%
recycling of mattresses the recycling of
 
01:23:22.350 --> 01:23:22.360 align:start position:0%
ewaste um there um paint recycling is
 
01:23:25.750 --> 01:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
certainly going to be coming back um so
 
01:23:27.310 --> 01:23:27.320 align:start position:0%
those are issues that are really that
 
01:23:30.350 --> 01:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
are being explored Now by um Solid Waste
 
01:23:33.709 --> 01:23:33.719 align:start position:0%
working group and I suspect that uh
 
01:23:36.310 --> 01:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
representative eel and a few other folks
 
01:23:40.030 --> 01:23:40.040 align:start position:0%
probably myself will be um developing
 
01:23:42.590 --> 01:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
some sort of uh legislation for next
 
01:23:45.070 --> 01:23:45.080 align:start position:0%
year okay are you looking in at uh
 
01:23:48.910 --> 01:23:48.920 align:start position:0%
dealing with plastic waste yes okay so
 
01:23:50.709 --> 01:23:50.719 align:start position:0%
uh um I guess that that was one of the
 
01:23:53.669 --> 01:23:53.679 align:start position:0%
things that uh the the single use
 
01:23:56.629 --> 01:23:56.639 align:start position:0%
Plastics that were part of that initial
 
01:23:59.910 --> 01:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
bill um I think was one of the things
 
01:24:03.870 --> 01:24:03.880 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to make sure that we BEC
 
01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:05.390 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to make sure that we BEC
because

01:24:05.390 --> 01:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:24:08.030 --> 01:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
there's that's that's a little bit more
 
01:24:10.110 --> 01:24:10.120 align:start position:0%
complicated that it's fairly complicated
 
01:24:15.430 --> 01:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh figuring out how to get
 
01:24:18.750 --> 01:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
in get industry on board in a way that's
 
01:24:21.950 --> 01:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
going to be effective and meet the um
 
01:24:25.470 --> 01:24:25.480 align:start position:0%
the goals that um environmental groups
 
01:24:27.709 --> 01:24:27.719 align:start position:0%
are also interested in making sure
 
01:24:30.350 --> 01:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
happen and I wanted and I was so I was
 
01:24:32.950 --> 01:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
thinking if we if we did that at ad hoc
 
01:24:37.189 --> 01:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
study then that would be a um that that
 
01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
would I think might be the main target
 
01:24:41.790 --> 01:24:41.800 align:start position:0%
there's certainly no harm in doing that
 
01:24:44.950 --> 01:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
I I I would be fine with that if you
 
01:24:48.189 --> 01:24:48.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to you know grab a a couple of
 
01:24:50.229 --> 01:24:50.239 align:start position:0%
people from this committee and maybe
 
01:24:52.990 --> 01:24:53.000 align:start position:0%
have uh representative eil included in
 
01:24:56.910 --> 01:24:56.920 align:start position:0%
it as well um to you know bat around
 
01:25:00.149 --> 01:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
some ideas for that um
 
01:25:02.750 --> 01:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
because yes a solid waste working group
 
01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
is looking into some of those things but
 
01:25:06.510 --> 01:25:06.520 align:start position:0%
you know I don't know to what extent
 
01:25:09.149 --> 01:25:09.159 align:start position:0%
they're going to have any particular
 
01:25:11.030 --> 01:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation put together and
 
01:25:13.270 --> 01:25:13.280 align:start position:0%
I'm what I'm thinking about is that
 
01:25:16.229 --> 01:25:16.239 align:start position:0%
getting the uh in terms of principles I
 
01:25:17.950 --> 01:25:17.960 align:start position:0%
think that the solid waste group is
 
01:25:21.109 --> 01:25:21.119 align:start position:0%
doing is is you know their leadership is
 
01:25:23.149 --> 01:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
really important but in terms of
 
01:25:24.910 --> 01:25:24.920 align:start position:0%
figuring out the nuts and bolts of how
 
01:25:27.229 --> 01:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
are we going to put a bill together uh
 
01:25:30.149 --> 01:25:30.159 align:start position:0%
and getting the input from multiple
 
01:25:32.590 --> 01:25:32.600 align:start position:0%
stakeholders I think that might be
 
01:25:34.310 --> 01:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
something that that an ad hoc committee
 
01:25:37.430 --> 01:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
could do okay that sounds
 
01:25:40.070 --> 01:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
good um all right
 
01:25:45.629 --> 01:25:45.639 align:start position:0%
so we have um one two three four five
 
01:25:49.550 --> 01:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
six seven sevenish subcommittees already
 
01:25:51.629 --> 01:25:51.639 align:start position:0%
put together there's an environment for
 
01:25:54.310 --> 01:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
this committee an environmental policy
 
01:25:57.430 --> 01:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee an agricultural policy and
 
01:25:59.629 --> 01:25:59.639 align:start position:0%
current use subcommittee an animal
 
01:26:01.629 --> 01:26:01.639 align:start position:0%
protection and Licensing subcommittee a
 
01:26:02.950 --> 01:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
solid waste
 
01:26:05.350 --> 01:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um certainly the one that
 
01:26:07.669 --> 01:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
met this morning the dees rules update
 
01:26:11.310 --> 01:26:11.320 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and uh I have assembled a
 
01:26:13.870 --> 01:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
new subcommittee food safety
 
01:26:18.109 --> 01:26:18.119 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so um hb1
 
01:26:20.629 --> 01:26:20.639 align:start position:0%
1351 prohibiting the sale and use of
 
01:26:23.350 --> 01:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
adhesive based rodent traps I'm kind of
 
01:26:25.550 --> 01:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out which would be an
 
01:26:28.990 --> 01:26:29.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate um policy subcommittee to to
 
01:26:30.030 --> 01:26:30.040 align:start position:0%
put that
 
01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:31.990 align:start position:0%
put that
under

01:26:31.990 --> 01:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
under
 
01:26:38.310 --> 01:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm leaning more towards the
 
01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
um ADV agricultural policy and current
 
01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:43.390 align:start position:0%
um ADV agricultural policy and current
use

01:26:43.390 --> 01:26:43.400 align:start position:0%
use
 
01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
because since Farmers seem to use some
 
01:26:48.950 --> 01:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
of these rodent traps I don't know maybe
 
01:26:51.109 --> 01:26:51.119 align:start position:0%
it's not maybe it's more environmental
 
01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
what I don't know what you would it's
 
01:26:55.910 --> 01:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
more of animal protection so I I think
 
01:26:59.189 --> 01:26:59.199 align:start position:0%
that the the the justifications for the
 
01:27:02.669 --> 01:27:02.679 align:start position:0%
bill that were brought to us had to do
 
01:27:06.030 --> 01:27:06.040 align:start position:0%
with um these traps are cruel uh these
 
01:27:10.189 --> 01:27:10.199 align:start position:0%
traps have uh Wildlife um you know
 
01:27:10.199 --> 01:27:11.430 align:start position:0%
traps have uh Wildlife um you know
bycatch

01:27:11.430 --> 01:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
bycatch
 
01:27:14.550 --> 01:27:14.560 align:start position:0%
implications uh which seems to be kind
 
01:27:16.350 --> 01:27:16.360 align:start position:0%
of in the animal realm you could also
 
01:27:17.870 --> 01:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
say that's kind of in the environmental
 
01:27:19.910 --> 01:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
realm I would I would more say the
 
01:27:23.470 --> 01:27:23.480 align:start position:0%
Environmental Policy simply because um
 
01:27:25.030 --> 01:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
you know we're talk talking about the
 
01:27:26.910 --> 01:27:26.920 align:start position:0%
same kind
 
01:27:31.510 --> 01:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
of Realm as pesticides and rodent
 
01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:33.470 align:start position:0%
of Realm as pesticides and rodent
control

01:27:33.470 --> 01:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
control
 
01:27:36.910 --> 01:27:36.920 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know i' I'd be fine with
 
01:27:38.310 --> 01:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
either I
 
01:27:43.790 --> 01:27:43.800 align:start position:0%
suppose um but okay so could you just on
 
01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
yeah Environmental Policy subcommittee
 
01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh representative Bixby chair
 
01:27:52.390 --> 01:27:52.400 align:start position:0%
representative veral brulard ktoa Penza
 
01:27:56.350 --> 01:27:56.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:59.189 --> 01:27:59.199 align:start position:0%
I I should have an animal and and the
 
01:28:03.109 --> 01:28:03.119 align:start position:0%
animal protection is kraton chair Kenny
 
01:28:07.510 --> 01:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
smart kulon H Haskins moris Murray and
 
01:28:11.990 --> 01:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
Duty represent Howard thank you um I I I
 
01:28:15.270 --> 01:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
would argue for agriculture because the
 
01:28:17.189 --> 01:28:17.199 align:start position:0%
strongest argument made for keeping
 
01:28:24.510 --> 01:28:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:27.070 --> 01:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
representative Penza has a
 
01:28:30.070 --> 01:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
question yeah I think that all of the
 
01:28:33.350 --> 01:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
opposition was this was a really hard
 
01:28:35.310 --> 01:28:35.320 align:start position:0%
Bill and there was so there was I mean
 
01:28:38.790 --> 01:28:38.800 align:start position:0%
we had I mean it was crazy hours and
 
01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
hours and we received so much
 
01:28:44.189 --> 01:28:44.199 align:start position:0%
information over email about this and
 
01:28:47.310 --> 01:28:47.320 align:start position:0%
most of it was people that were using
 
01:28:49.510 --> 01:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
these in the wrong way because if
 
01:28:51.709 --> 01:28:51.719 align:start position:0%
they're used in the correct way there
 
01:28:54.149 --> 01:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be a problem we should never
 
01:28:56.350 --> 01:28:56.360 align:start position:0%
you know have um there shouldn't be
 
01:28:59.350 --> 01:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
wildlife and in animals or kittens and
 
01:29:00.910 --> 01:29:00.920 align:start position:0%
all of these different types of things
 
01:29:03.109 --> 01:29:03.119 align:start position:0%
Birds um that are caught in these
 
01:29:04.750 --> 01:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
because they're not made to be put like
 
01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
outside and stuff so you know that on
 
01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
that piece you you see the animal but
 
01:29:12.830 --> 01:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
it's in the intents and purposes all the
 
01:29:15.149 --> 01:29:15.159 align:start position:0%
opposition was to protect from that so
 
01:29:17.430 --> 01:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
it really I don't know it's I think it's
 
01:29:20.990 --> 01:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
more of an environmental than than it is
 
01:29:23.590 --> 01:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
representative NAB um I just want to
 
01:29:24.790 --> 01:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
agree with that because I think the
 
01:29:25.910 --> 01:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
stakeholders you're going to want to
 
01:29:28.590 --> 01:29:28.600 align:start position:0%
have in the conversation are Farm groups
 
01:29:30.709 --> 01:29:30.719 align:start position:0%
and Pest Control groups we know that
 
01:29:31.790 --> 01:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
animal rights groups are going to
 
01:29:33.910 --> 01:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
support this bill right so those aren't
 
01:29:35.229 --> 01:29:35.239 align:start position:0%
the people we need to bring to the table
 
01:29:37.629 --> 01:29:37.639 align:start position:0%
I think um if we have a conversation
 
01:29:40.790 --> 01:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:42.590 align:start position:0%
 
forward

01:29:42.590 --> 01:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:29:45.070 --> 01:29:45.080 align:start position:0%
okay well I'm going to I'm going to
 
01:29:47.390 --> 01:29:47.400 align:start position:0%
suggest that it it is
 
01:29:50.030 --> 01:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
um sent to the Environmental Policy
 
01:29:53.510 --> 01:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so representative Bixby I I
 
01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
I would like you to uh come and Deere
 
01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
that effort I I don't know if you I mean
 
01:30:01.750 --> 01:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
you don't you can have a subset of that
 
01:30:03.550 --> 01:30:03.560 align:start position:0%
committee meet if you don't want to take
 
01:30:05.590 --> 01:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
the charge of actually dealing with the
 
01:30:08.750 --> 01:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
bill so um so and and I will you know I
 
01:30:12.070 --> 01:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
will be happy to chare it and then um
 
01:30:15.750 --> 01:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
basically moderate the sessions but I I
 
01:30:17.709 --> 01:30:17.719 align:start position:0%
um in terms of but it sounds like
 
01:30:19.430 --> 01:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
representative H Haskins has a lot of
 
01:30:21.990 --> 01:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
ideas about how to go forward with that
 
01:30:25.830 --> 01:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
um would you be okay with not actually
 
01:30:28.430 --> 01:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
doing our meetings until uh September
 
01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:30.550 align:start position:0%

sure
 
01:30:34.350 --> 01:30:34.360 align:start position:0%
okay okay so we we agree that it should
 
01:30:36.470 --> 01:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
go to environmental policy subcommittee
 
01:30:38.830 --> 01:30:38.840 align:start position:0%
and you guys are going to uh Begin work
 
01:30:40.390 --> 01:30:40.400 align:start position:0%

good morning um your chairman um I'm
 
01:33:02.950 --> 01:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
delighted to help you work on this bill
 
01:33:05.790 --> 01:33:05.800 align:start position:0%
in June wherever you'd like to I'm free
 
01:33:08.629 --> 01:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
all right wonderful thank
 
01:33:12.950 --> 01:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:15.910 --> 01:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
okay yeah
 
01:33:19.430 --> 01:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
um and you know we're not with any of
 
01:33:21.629 --> 01:33:21.639 align:start position:0%
these bills it doesn't necessarily mean
 
01:33:24.750 --> 01:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
that you have to take the bill itself
 
01:33:27.390 --> 01:33:27.400 align:start position:0%
and reward it and rework it and resubmit
 
01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
it as a bill in the fall you can come up
 
01:33:32.229 --> 01:33:32.239 align:start position:0%
with something totally different um it's
 
01:33:34.790 --> 01:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
it's the up to the committee to decide
 
01:33:37.270 --> 01:33:37.280 align:start position:0%
though um with the with the dis
 
01:33:40.109 --> 01:33:40.119 align:start position:0%
conversations that they have on on
 
01:33:40.119 --> 01:33:41.629 align:start position:0%
conversations that they have on on
this

01:33:41.629 --> 01:33:41.639 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:33:45.310 --> 01:33:45.320 align:start position:0%
would warrant further legislation or not
 
01:33:46.750 --> 01:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
which is what the subcommittee would
 
01:33:49.550 --> 01:33:49.560 align:start position:0%
recommend to the full body uh when we
 
01:33:52.629 --> 01:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
meet in the fall representative Bixby
 
01:33:54.310 --> 01:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
yeah so um
 
01:33:58.709 --> 01:33:58.719 align:start position:0%
and so in terms of the the the strict
 
01:34:00.910 --> 01:34:00.920 align:start position:0%
details yes the the committee is just
 
01:34:02.590 --> 01:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
recommending whether it whether or not
 
01:34:06.229 --> 01:34:06.239 align:start position:0%
it needs further legislation um ideally
 
01:34:09.350 --> 01:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
a good you know a a
 
01:34:13.669 --> 01:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
well uh a well done in term study uh if
 
01:34:16.270 --> 01:34:16.280 align:start position:0%
there if if it's recognized that it
 
01:34:20.350 --> 01:34:20.360 align:start position:0%
makes sense to do um to do further
 
01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
legislation it often makes sense to uh
 
01:34:26.270 --> 01:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
help at least begin to to work out the
 
01:34:28.510 --> 01:34:28.520 align:start position:0%
structure of that legislation although
 
01:34:30.310 --> 01:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
it would be an individual member who is
 
01:34:33.629 --> 01:34:33.639 align:start position:0%
reelected who would be actually
 
01:34:36.870 --> 01:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
sponsoring the bill for the next term
 
01:34:39.189 --> 01:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
correct okay represent
 
01:34:41.510 --> 01:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
Penza so I just had a question about
 
01:34:44.990 --> 01:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
timing so let's say um you know stuff is
 
01:34:47.629 --> 01:34:47.639 align:start position:0%
worked on in June or even in the summer
 
01:34:49.550 --> 01:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
um like this bill that we're talking
 
01:34:54.189 --> 01:34:54.199 align:start position:0%
about so um in if it's put in and you
 
01:34:55.870 --> 01:34:55.880 align:start position:0%
know is there a way that this is like in
 
01:34:58.430 --> 01:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
a sense an early bill or fast-tracked
 
01:35:00.910 --> 01:35:00.920 align:start position:0%
you know there so no no so this just
 
01:35:02.709 --> 01:35:02.719 align:start position:0%
goes into the regular stream of our
 
01:35:05.390 --> 01:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
bills come you know if if I mean if
 
01:35:08.350 --> 01:35:08.360 align:start position:0%
there's if there's any kind of financial
 
01:35:10.109 --> 01:35:10.119 align:start position:0%
um aspect to the bill that you're going
 
01:35:13.510 --> 01:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
to file that would be an early Bill the
 
01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
beginning of next year okay but in terms
 
01:35:19.510 --> 01:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
of being an early Bill or fast-tracked
 
01:35:22.750 --> 01:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
Bill kind of thing um but other than
 
01:35:25.310 --> 01:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
that it would just go into the regular
 
01:35:29.310 --> 01:35:29.320 align:start position:0%
pile of bills that the legislature would
 
01:35:31.070 --> 01:35:31.080 align:start position:0%
uh would
 
01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
consider the thing is that we have two
 
01:35:37.709 --> 01:35:37.719 align:start position:0%
times in which to be able to file bills
 
01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
there is an early filing for um for the
 
01:35:45.590 --> 01:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
I guess it's uh September sep yes so so
 
01:35:47.430 --> 01:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
there's there's an early filing period
 
01:35:50.350 --> 01:35:50.360 align:start position:0%
which is usually a week or two in
 
01:35:54.310 --> 01:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
September and that is for essentially
 
01:35:58.910 --> 01:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
um current members and often the the
 
01:36:01.790 --> 01:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
main usefulness of that is if you want
 
01:36:04.510 --> 01:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
to say well I filed in your campaign I
 
01:36:06.149 --> 01:36:06.159 align:start position:0%
filed a bill on this or that or the
 
01:36:10.189 --> 01:36:10.199 align:start position:0%
other thing and uh and oh Wells doesn't
 
01:36:11.669 --> 01:36:11.679 align:start position:0%
actually do a whole lot of work on those
 
01:36:14.830 --> 01:36:14.840 align:start position:0%
bills until uh after the election
 
01:36:17.070 --> 01:36:17.080 align:start position:0%
because if the M Prime sponsor of the
 
01:36:20.830 --> 01:36:20.840 align:start position:0%
bill does not get reelected then they
 
01:36:22.790 --> 01:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
would have done a bunch of work that you
 
01:36:26.390 --> 01:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
know is not going anywhere uh
 
01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
so uh in just in terms of strategy for
 
01:36:32.310 --> 01:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
interim study bills and and legislation
 
01:36:34.270 --> 01:36:34.280 align:start position:0%
that comes out of them it makes sense to
 
01:36:36.270 --> 01:36:36.280 align:start position:0%
just aim for that November fining period
 
01:36:38.310 --> 01:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
that's right after the election y
 
01:36:41.070 --> 01:36:41.080 align:start position:0%
because that way uh you have that time
 
01:36:44.030 --> 01:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
to work in the fall uh it's not going to
 
01:36:47.189 --> 01:36:47.199 align:start position:0%
get there's no advantage of trying to
 
01:36:49.990 --> 01:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
get it out by September right so uh you
 
01:36:51.709 --> 01:36:51.719 align:start position:0%
can get the work you can get a more
 
01:36:54.870 --> 01:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
thoroughly worked out Bill to oh which
 
01:36:56.669 --> 01:36:56.679 align:start position:0%
makes the which will get things moving
 
01:36:59.189 --> 01:36:59.199 align:start position:0%
faster than uh than trying to get it in
 
01:37:01.950 --> 01:37:01.960 align:start position:0%
sooner correct okay thanks
 
01:37:04.470 --> 01:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
representative ger thank you madam chair
 
01:37:05.830 --> 01:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
could you remind us who the members of
 
01:37:07.590 --> 01:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
the solid waste subcommittee are because
 
01:37:08.830 --> 01:37:08.840 align:start position:0%
I know I'm on that and I'd like to work
 
01:37:10.470 --> 01:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
on it but I want to know who the chair
 
01:37:12.030 --> 01:37:12.040 align:start position:0%
is other MERS that's uh representative
 
01:37:14.149 --> 01:37:14.159 align:start position:0%
Murray is the chair of that and we have
 
01:37:17.350 --> 01:37:17.360 align:start position:0%
representative brulard Davis kulan Penza
 
01:37:22.030 --> 01:37:22.040 align:start position:0%
NAB saitis and German okay thank you I
 
01:37:23.870 --> 01:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps reach out to representative Mur
 
01:37:26.470 --> 01:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
about what timeline might work for her
 
01:37:30.629 --> 01:37:30.639 align:start position:0%
yes indeed yeah so uh so that would be
 
01:37:32.310 --> 01:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
that would be HB
 
01:37:36.070 --> 01:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
1170 and that would go to the solid
 
01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:38.310 align:start position:0%
1170 and that would go to the solid
waste

01:37:38.310 --> 01:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
waste
 
01:37:42.790 --> 01:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and um I did send out a
 
01:37:47.109 --> 01:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
copy of this list of subcommittees to
 
01:37:49.950 --> 01:37:49.960 align:start position:0%
committee members I will send it out
 
01:37:58.830 --> 01:37:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:00.870 --> 01:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry that I did not make copies
 
01:38:04.990 --> 01:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
for everybody for today but okay okay
 
01:38:06.790 --> 01:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
representive H Haskins thank you madam
 
01:38:11.430 --> 01:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:16.870 --> 01:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
um aliceon NAB for animals to solid
 
01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:18.430 align:start position:0%
um aliceon NAB for animals to solid
waste

01:38:18.430 --> 01:38:18.440 align:start position:0%
waste
 
01:38:22.750 --> 01:38:22.760 align:start position:0%
and representative Bixby agreed and I
 
01:38:25.510 --> 01:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
think you saw no reason not to switch
 
01:38:27.709 --> 01:38:27.719 align:start position:0%
that's correct now that you refreshed my
 
01:38:30.669 --> 01:38:30.679 align:start position:0%
memory about that email so that's fine
 
01:38:33.070 --> 01:38:33.080 align:start position:0%
okay um so for the solid way
 
01:38:36.750 --> 01:38:36.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I would uh swap out
 
01:38:38.629 --> 01:38:38.639 align:start position:0%
representative NAB for representative H
 
01:38:41.790 --> 01:38:41.800 align:start position:0%
Haskins and put representative NAB on
 
01:38:45.149 --> 01:38:45.159 align:start position:0%
the animal protection subcommittee which
 
01:38:48.510 --> 01:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
I guess won't be meeting so it's it's
 
01:38:50.390 --> 01:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
fine there you
 
01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:52.109 align:start position:0%
fine there you
go

01:38:52.109 --> 01:38:52.119 align:start position:0%
go
 
01:38:55.109 --> 01:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
okay um it's so let me let me take care
 
01:39:07.750 --> 01:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:14.149 --> 01:39:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:16.950 --> 01:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
that yeah yeah that is the only
 
01:39:20.070 --> 01:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that she was
 
01:39:23.910 --> 01:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
on it might be a move point balance at
 
01:39:26.350 --> 01:39:26.360 align:start position:0%
this point but we it should probably be
 
01:39:28.149 --> 01:39:28.159 align:start position:0%
and some people are on several
 
01:39:32.390 --> 01:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
one it just in terms of
 
01:39:35.510 --> 01:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
um making things even but I don't I'm
 
01:39:37.629 --> 01:39:37.639 align:start position:0%
not sure that it
 
01:39:37.639 --> 01:39:46.510 align:start position:0%
not sure that it
you

01:39:46.510 --> 01:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:50.390 --> 01:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:56.550 --> 01:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:00.910 --> 01:40:00.920 align:start position:0%
yeah oh okay you're just having a okay
 
01:40:04.350 --> 01:40:04.360 align:start position:0%
all right so um so we will uh assign
 
01:40:06.750 --> 01:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
those bills to those particular um
 
01:40:09.350 --> 01:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittees and uh I'll leave it up to
 
01:40:10.750 --> 01:40:10.760 align:start position:0%
the chairs
 
01:40:13.870 --> 01:40:13.880 align:start position:0%
to figure out when they want to meet and
 
01:40:17.350 --> 01:40:17.360 align:start position:0%
uh we as a committee would then return
 
01:40:18.310 --> 01:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
back in
 
01:40:20.910 --> 01:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
September uh with some recommendations
 
01:40:22.830 --> 01:40:22.840 align:start position:0%
from those subcomittees as to whether or
 
01:40:25.870 --> 01:40:25.880 align:start position:0%
not uh the bills require further
 
01:40:28.750 --> 01:40:28.760 align:start position:0%
legislation or not and we might
 
01:40:30.750 --> 01:40:30.760 align:start position:0%
conceivably October depending on how
 
01:40:34.589 --> 01:40:34.599 align:start position:0%
much work right
 
01:40:38.270 --> 01:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
yep okay any other questions comments
 
01:40:39.470 --> 01:40:39.480 align:start position:0%

01:40:42.709 --> 01:40:42.719 align:start position:0%
committee representative ger uh I would
 
01:40:44.310 --> 01:40:44.320 align:start position:0%

01:40:48.109 --> 01:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
Madam chair for her letter to uh de with
 
01:40:49.750 --> 01:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
the questions regarding leech a
 
01:40:53.310 --> 01:40:53.320 align:start position:0%
treatment and concerns about NC's cap
 
01:40:55.790 --> 01:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
capacity to deal with the lee8 so I very
 
01:40:57.910 --> 01:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
much appreciate you speaking on behalf
 
01:40:59.669 --> 01:40:59.679 align:start position:0%
of the committee and asking some great
 
01:41:01.870 --> 01:41:01.880 align:start position:0%
questions thank you and I am still
 
01:41:04.510 --> 01:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
waiting for a reply from Dees who has
 
01:41:07.470 --> 01:41:07.480 align:start position:0%
promised this to me um they said early
 
01:41:12.030 --> 01:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
this week so I'll wait till
 
01:41:16.550 --> 01:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
Wednesday I I second that thank you yeah
 
01:41:19.070 --> 01:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
thank you I I appreciate that um you
 
01:41:22.229 --> 01:41:22.239 align:start position:0%
know I I did um appreciate the emails
 
01:41:25.830 --> 01:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
that I've re received uh with various
 
01:41:29.149 --> 01:41:29.159 align:start position:0%
concerns um on a lot of different things
 
01:41:31.830 --> 01:41:31.840 align:start position:0%
but the uh topic of leech 8 and and how
 
01:41:35.229 --> 01:41:35.239 align:start position:0%
it's been handled and how much of it etc
 
01:41:38.990 --> 01:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
etc uh certainly warranted a uh an email
 
01:41:43.669 --> 01:41:43.679 align:start position:0%
to um both uh commissioner Scott and
 
01:41:46.830 --> 01:41:46.840 align:start position:0%
director whims sat about so hopefully we
 
01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
will hear something of substance from
 
01:41:52.430 --> 01:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
them and if not then I will be very
 
01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:56.189 align:start position:0%
them and if not then I will be very
concerned

01:41:56.189 --> 01:41:56.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:58.310 --> 01:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
might an indication of a need for
 
01:42:00.510 --> 01:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
legislation absolutely
 
01:42:04.870 --> 01:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely um and I I am certainly
 
01:42:07.990 --> 01:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
expecting a uh another flurry of uh
 
01:42:11.870 --> 01:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste bills next year so uh I know
 
01:42:13.470 --> 01:42:13.480 align:start position:0%
this is to be
 
01:42:17.189 --> 01:42:17.199 align:start position:0%
continued um certainly been
 
01:42:20.030 --> 01:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
um disappointing from what we've seen in
 
01:42:22.350 --> 01:42:22.360 align:start position:0%
the senate in terms of their inaction
 
01:42:23.950 --> 01:42:23.960 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:42:30.790 --> 01:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:34.910 --> 01:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
you makeup make up of yeah government
 
01:42:37.270 --> 01:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
next term we might have more luck with
 
01:42:39.109 --> 01:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
some of the bills that
 
01:42:42.189 --> 01:42:42.199 align:start position:0%
we passed unanimous unanimously out of
 
01:42:42.199 --> 01:42:45.350 align:start position:0%
we passed unanimous unanimously out of
our

01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:49.310 --> 01:42:49.320 align:start position:0%

01:42:51.750 --> 01:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
