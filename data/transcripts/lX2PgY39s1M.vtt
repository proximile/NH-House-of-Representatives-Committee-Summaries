00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 align:start position:0%
let's turn on my mic um before we get
 
00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
started with bills I just want to um and
 
00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:28.759 align:start position:0%
I'm sure the prime sponsor won't mind my
 
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 align:start position:0%
delay cuz it's me
 
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
um I want to uh just because it's our
 
00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:35.319 align:start position:0%
first one of the year and we've got a
 
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
new member and we've got some subs I
 
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
want to give a a reminder about deorum
 
00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:41.319 align:start position:0%
of the committee before we get started
 
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
we haven't had any issues in this
 
00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 align:start position:0%
committee but some other committees have
 
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
had some rough patches they've hit um I
 
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
want to remind people that we're here to
 
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
listen to the public and departments
 
00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:51.919 align:start position:0%
with regard to the bills before us we're
 
00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:54.039 align:start position:0%
not here to debate the public on the or
 
00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 align:start position:0%
the Departments questions must be
 
00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
legitimate questions not statements of
 
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
your opinion disc disguised as
 
00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
questions all those testifying will be
 
00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 align:start position:0%
treated with respect as your treatment
 
00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520 align:start position:0%
of those testifying reflects directly on
 
00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
you your office and this committee
 
00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
there's a difference between asking a
 
00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
question and challenging somebody do not
 
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
ever challenge members of the public who
 
00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:17.599 align:start position:0%
took time from their day to be here I
 
00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:19.319 align:start position:0%
will allow more leeway in questioning
 
00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:20.759 align:start position:0%
departments or lobbyists as they're
 
00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
doing their jobs here and they should be
 
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
experts on the information they provide
 
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
us I will also expect any Department to
 
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
testify solely to the facts and
 
00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
positions not personal opinions and I
 
00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.360 align:start position:0%
expect the complete truth decorum
 
00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800 align:start position:0%
requires you be recognized before
 
00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.120 align:start position:0%
speaking request a followup if necessary
 
00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
and address the chair appropriately
 
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
don't forget to thank the chair and the
 
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.070 align:start position:0%
don't forget to thank the chair and the
person

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
testifying failure to adhere to decorum
 
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
will result in a warning multiple or
 
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
egregious failures to follow of Quorum
 
00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
may result in you being removed from the
 
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
committee no one has a right to be on a
 
00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
committee it's a privilege and it can be
 
00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:56.440 align:start position:0%
suspended or
 
00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.390 align:start position:0%
suspended or
revoked

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
revoked
 
00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.950 align:start position:0%
revoked
and

00:06:59.950 --> 00:06:59.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
with that I need to explain that the
 
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
vice chair will be here today he's just
 
00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:05.199 align:start position:0%
uh got an appointment that's very
 
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:06.360 align:start position:0%
important so he's going to be a little
 
00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
late and I'm going to be turning over
 
00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:13.000 align:start position:0%
chair position while I introduce three
 
00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:17.199 align:start position:0%
bills to the clerk and then uh
 
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
representative wette will act as clerk
 
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
um and so I'll let the chair or the the
 
00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:30.280 align:start position:0%
clerk be the chair and open up the
 
00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:43.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
leisure if you just bear with me for one
 
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
minute while I give a quick uh uh
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:58.319 --> 00:08:31.070 align:start position:0%
 
here

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:33.149 --> 00:08:33.159 align:start position:0%
all right good morning um I'm going to
 
00:08:37.029 --> 00:08:37.039 align:start position:0%
open the hearing on HB
 
00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:39.640 align:start position:0%
11116 and have the prime sponsor begin
 
00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.829 align:start position:0%
11116 and have the prime sponsor begin
his

00:08:40.829 --> 00:08:40.839 align:start position:0%
his
 
00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
presentation thank you Mr chair uh for
 
00:08:45.509 --> 00:08:45.519 align:start position:0%
the record I am representative James
 
00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
Spain uh and I represent Rockingham
 
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:52.200 align:start position:0%
2 1116 is a bill that uh I brought
 
00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
forward uh as a housekeeping measure
 
00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:57.640 align:start position:0%
essentially but also uh because of the
 
00:09:00.829 --> 00:09:00.839 align:start position:0%
the success of the lever action bill
 
00:09:04.389 --> 00:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
that we passed uh last term so four
 
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:07.480 align:start position:0%
years ago um when we introduced that
 
00:09:09.269 --> 00:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of evidence that we
 
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
presented uh on how the lever action
 
00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:16.399 align:start position:0%
carbine rifle shooting a handgun caliber
 
00:09:19.269 --> 00:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
was uh safer than a handgun because it
 
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:22.360 align:start position:0%
could be directed with more precision
 
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
and it was then allowed and uh passed
 
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:26.680 align:start position:0%
bipartisan through this committee and
 
00:09:30.389 --> 00:09:30.399 align:start position:0%
the house to and the Senate and Etc to
 
00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:34.760 align:start position:0%
uh allow for use of those uh rifles in
 
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
areas that were handgun or shotgun only
 
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
um I'm not going to get into the
 
00:09:41.069 --> 00:09:41.079 align:start position:0%
ballistics again but rest assured I can
 
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
remind people that the ballistics coming
 
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
out of a carbine rifle over those coming
 
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
out of the handgun were only about 200
 
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
ft per second difference um because of
 
00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
the the specific pistol calibers we
 
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
allowed and at the time it was just 357
 
00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
44 Magnums and 45 Long CTS that was as a
 
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
trial to to see if if uh if it went okay
 
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
and if it was uh safe and popular uh
 
00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
fishing game had a lot of calls and I've
 
00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
gotten calls and people wanting to try
 
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
other calibers um because they don't own
 
00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
one of these but they are in an area
 
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:16.240 align:start position:0%
where it would be beneficial for them to
 
00:10:19.509 --> 00:10:19.519 align:start position:0%
be able to use a safer gun uh than a
 
00:10:23.829 --> 00:10:23.839 align:start position:0%
handgun and um so this bill is
 
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
essentially uh making a change to the
 
00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:28.760 align:start position:0%
current law as it as it was signed in uh
 
00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:32.440 align:start position:0%
last term to uh remove the lever action
 
00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:34.120 align:start position:0%
part because it doesn't matter if the
 
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
rifle is lever action pump action single
 
00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:39.160 align:start position:0%
shot break open what have you that
 
00:10:41.389 --> 00:10:41.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect the the bullet itself and
 
00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:43.519 align:start position:0%
we had some people that had some single
 
00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:46.040 align:start position:0%
shots or uh pump actions and I hadn't
 
00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
even thought about those because they're
 
00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:50.720 align:start position:0%
not as popular as the lever action is um
 
00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
and then in an effort to do
 
00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
housekeeping um there's another billal
 
00:10:58.269 --> 00:10:58.279 align:start position:0%
here today that we're going to change
 
00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
the way the RS a lists all of the
 
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
calibers that are permissible for
 
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
handgun use in uh in hunting in the
 
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
state to make it easier for us to
 
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
maintain as new calibers come in um I
 
00:11:13.389 --> 00:11:13.399 align:start position:0%
don't want to get too deep into that now
 
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
but this follows the same pattern as
 
00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:18.440 align:start position:0%
that other housekeeping Bill and in and
 
00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
what it's doing is saying that any
 
00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:22.360 align:start position:0%
straight walled pistol cartridge that's
 
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
larger than a 38/357 now the larger than
 
00:11:29.949 --> 00:11:29.959 align:start position:0%
38/357 is exactly match ing up with the
 
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
way the RSA on permissible pistol rounds
 
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
will be the fact that we limited it to
 
00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:37.480 align:start position:0%
straight walled pistol cartridges is a
 
00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
ballistics issue any bullet that's
 
00:11:43.389 --> 00:11:43.399 align:start position:0%
necked down has higher velocity a
 
00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:45.240 align:start position:0%
straight walled pistol cartridge has
 
00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:48.200 align:start position:0%
lower velocity so in order to keep this
 
00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
in the safety aspect using these rifles
 
00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
in the pistol hunting areas we don't
 
00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
want someone coming in with a
 
00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
specialized pistol that's a single shot
 
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
308 rifle cartridge which technically is
 
00:12:03.389 --> 00:12:03.399 align:start position:0%
still good for pistol hunting but not in
 
00:12:05.829 --> 00:12:05.839 align:start position:0%
these areas where it was pistol and
 
00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
shotgun only for a reason we want it to
 
00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:09.880 align:start position:0%
be limited to just those straight walled
 
00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
lower velocity pistol
 
00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:14.680 align:start position:0%
cartridges um and that's it I can take
 
00:12:17.389 --> 00:12:17.399 align:start position:0%
any questions if anybody has any but uh
 
00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:20.680 align:start position:0%
that is the extent of
 
00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
116 uh thank you representative any
 
00:12:24.269 --> 00:12:24.279 align:start position:0%
questions from
 
00:12:27.189 --> 00:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
anyone uh representative
 
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
Derby thank you Mr chair uh thank you
 
00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um when we're
 
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
talking about changing the actions
 
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
allowed from Lever Action to you know
 
00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
single shop that would include
 
00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.710 align:start position:0%
single shop that would include
semi-automatic

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
semi-automatic
 
00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
um it just says rifle but I don't know
 
00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:43.880 align:start position:0%
of any semi-automatics that are
 
00:12:45.949 --> 00:12:45.959 align:start position:0%
chambered in pistol rounds but I I would
 
00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:47.560 align:start position:0%
assume that yeah I guess semi-automatics
 
00:12:49.949 --> 00:12:49.959 align:start position:0%
would be in there as well uh mainly it's
 
00:12:52.949 --> 00:12:52.959 align:start position:0%
meant to address breake opens uh pumps
 
00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:56.120 align:start position:0%
lever action bolt
 
00:12:59.710 --> 00:12:59.720 align:start position:0%
action I think that's pretty much it
 
00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:02.360 align:start position:0%
um follow thank you thank you Mr chair
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
um have you heard of ARS being um reali
 
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
for these um single walled straight
 
00:13:15.069 --> 00:13:15.079 align:start position:0%
walled um uh pistol rounds no I don't uh
 
00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
I haven't heard of any ARS being
 
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
chambered in a straight walled pistol uh
 
00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:23.560 align:start position:0%
cartridge uh and I would say that even
 
00:13:25.509 --> 00:13:25.519 align:start position:0%
if that was the case they still have to
 
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
adhere to the uh no more than uh six
 
00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:30.680 align:start position:0%
rounds and all of this other stuff that
 
00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
that has to be followed by the regular
 
00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:37.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
you uh no other questions yep
 
00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.150 align:start position:0%
you uh no other questions yep
representative

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:44.959 align:start position:0%
Harvey so representative Spain you know
 
00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
my limited knowledge about uh guns and
 
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
so forth so I'm going to ask a question
 
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:52.240 align:start position:0%
that probably shows that limited
 
00:13:53.749 --> 00:13:53.759 align:start position:0%
knowledge and hopefully you can help me
 
00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
with all questions are good questions go
 
00:13:59.389 --> 00:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
for it so my my question is um
 
00:14:03.189 --> 00:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
is this um a significant enough gun to
 
00:14:08.069 --> 00:14:08.079 align:start position:0%
take down an animal a a deer yes um
 
00:14:10.269 --> 00:14:10.279 align:start position:0%
that's why it's we're we're also saying
 
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
38/357 and greater that's currently the
 
00:14:15.069 --> 00:14:15.079 align:start position:0%
the lowest limit that we're allowed to
 
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
use in regular pistol hunting for deer
 
00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
um and that's why it's it's staying
 
00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:21.320 align:start position:0%
there and that's the clarification we're
 
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
going to make in the rules for the the
 
00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
other pistol hunting or handgun hunting
 
00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:29.000 align:start position:0%
section as well where currently every
 
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
single caliber is listed out and one of
 
00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
those is listed incorrectly anyway so it
 
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
needs to be cleaned up but yeah okay
 
00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:39.880 align:start position:0%
thank you so much I appreciate
 
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:45.949 --> 00:14:45.959 align:start position:0%
questions um seeing none there's no
 
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:47.480 align:start position:0%
other pink cards Mr cheriff I might add
 
00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:49.240 align:start position:0%
one more thing that I I wanted to
 
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
address towards uh representative Darby
 
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
because it it comes along with your
 
00:14:55.629 --> 00:14:55.639 align:start position:0%
question there's nothing in the handgun
 
00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:57.320 align:start position:0%
hunting area right now that prohibits
 
00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
semi-automatic handguns either so
 
00:15:01.389 --> 00:15:01.399 align:start position:0%
semi-automatic handguns if they're in
 
00:15:04.389 --> 00:15:04.399 align:start position:0%
the appropriate caliber can be used
 
00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:07.160 align:start position:0%
rather than a revolver say so if you had
 
00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:11.720 align:start position:0%
a 357 or uh you had a 10 mm you could
 
00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:14.920 align:start position:0%
use a semi-automatic 10 mm uh in handgun
 
00:15:16.629 --> 00:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
hunting and it's still allowed but it
 
00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:21.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
it okay seeing no further questions uh
 
00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:27.160 align:start position:0%
is there any I have no more pink cards
 
00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
any one wanting to add test testimony
 
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
from the back and I don't see any so at
 
00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
that point I'll close the hearing on
 
00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
1116 I'll stay right where I am if
 
00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:46.030 align:start position:0%
1116 I'll stay right where I am if
that's

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:48.509 --> 00:15:48.519 align:start position:0%
okay I I will double check with the with
 
00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
the real chair uh we're short of our
 
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
10:30 schedule time shall we have to
 
00:15:54.509 --> 00:15:54.519 align:start position:0%
wait yep that's what I thought all right
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
so we will be on on uh Hiatus here until
 
00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.389 align:start position:0%
so we will be on on uh Hiatus here until
10:30

00:15:59.389 --> 00:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
10:30
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:27.519 --> 00:33:54.430 align:start position:0%
 
chair

00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:56.509 --> 00:33:56.519 align:start position:0%
all right as we are at uh a little bit
 
00:33:59.149 --> 00:33:59.159 align:start position:0%
past 10 :30 we're going to uh begin
 
00:34:02.149 --> 00:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
again and open the hearing on House Bill
 
00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
presenting thank you Mr chairman thank
 
00:34:11.589 --> 00:34:11.599 align:start position:0%
you members of the committee I'm
 
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
actually introducing this for the prime
 
00:34:15.149 --> 00:34:15.159 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative Manion because he
 
00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:17.399 align:start position:0%
couldn't be here he's sick he and I had
 
00:34:18.869 --> 00:34:18.879 align:start position:0%
already had a discussion because his
 
00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
bill does everything that we just talked
 
00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
about in 116 except mine does more um
 
00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:27.800 align:start position:0%
his bill uh he when he we don't know why
 
00:34:29.589 --> 00:34:29.599 align:start position:0%
OS allowed two identical bills to be
 
00:34:32.430 --> 00:34:32.440 align:start position:0%
drafted okay this is an OS issue his
 
00:34:34.349 --> 00:34:34.359 align:start position:0%
bill simply changes it from Lever Action
 
00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:36.919 align:start position:0%
to any action which we just talked about
 
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
but it still leaves it to only 35744
 
00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:41.960 align:start position:0%
Magnum or 45 Colt which we've been
 
00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:43.480 align:start position:0%
getting calls through fish and game
 
00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
department and everywhere else and I've
 
00:34:46.669 --> 00:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
had discussions with Colonel Jordan at
 
00:34:48.349 --> 00:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
the department and it was the language
 
00:34:49.869 --> 00:34:49.879 align:start position:0%
of straight wall pistol cartridge came
 
00:34:51.069 --> 00:34:51.079 align:start position:0%
up in our
 
00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
conversation um so uh I wanted to make
 
00:34:57.589 --> 00:34:57.599 align:start position:0%
sure that uh you all knew that this bill
 
00:34:59.910 --> 00:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
is not really necessary but I'm
 
00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:02.440 align:start position:0%
introducing it as for representative
 
00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:06.040 align:start position:0%
Manion and um that's it and I won't take
 
00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
any questions but I believe there is uh
 
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
somebody who else is on the bill to
 
00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
speak to more about
 
00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
it uh thank you representative Spain and
 
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
Walsh thank you Mr chairman for the
 
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
record I'm representative Lily Walsh I
 
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
represent Rockingham
 
00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
15 I uh wrote this bill along with uh
 
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
representative Manion uh at the request
 
00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
of a
 
00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
constituent and I was unaware of uh
 
00:35:44.069 --> 00:35:44.079 align:start position:0%
chairman Spain's uh bill that actually
 
00:35:48.109 --> 00:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
covers more so I am in support of his
 
00:35:52.309 --> 00:35:52.319 align:start position:0%
bill as well and it uh it actually does
 
00:35:54.829 --> 00:35:54.839 align:start position:0%
a lot more than our bill was that uh we
 
00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
wrote so that's all I have have to say
 
00:35:59.790 --> 00:35:59.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative any
 
00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:02.680 align:start position:0%
questions representative Derby thank you

Mr chair I thank you for taking my
 
00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:07.960 align:start position:0%
question um Can did the constituent uh
 
00:36:11.349 --> 00:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
mention what uh you know what caliber or
 
00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:13.960 align:start position:0%
what uh action uh rifle that they were
 
00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
interested in
 
00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
carrying well the point that my
 
00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:21.160 align:start position:0%
constituent asked for is that any action
 
00:36:23.589 --> 00:36:23.599 align:start position:0%
uh be allowed and that was that was the
 
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:25.720 align:start position:0%
point of writing this
 
00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:29.150 align:start position:0%
point of writing this
bill

00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:32.000 align:start position:0%

Harvey thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:38:05.589 --> 00:38:05.599 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so would this be
 
00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
a bill that would be better um handled
 
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
through fish and game rules rather than
 
00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:12.440 align:start position:0%
here on the legislative
 
00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
floor um I I really can't answer that
 
00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:19.640 align:start position:0%
with any degree of
 
00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:21.150 align:start position:0%
with any degree of
confidence

00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:21.160 align:start position:0%
confidence
 
00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:23.720 align:start position:0%
okay meaning that I'm not sure we have
 
00:38:25.829 --> 00:38:25.839 align:start position:0%
the authority to address it in roles
 
00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
okay that that was what I was asking I
 
00:38:32.109 --> 00:38:32.119 align:start position:0%
didn't say it correctly thank
 
00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
you representative Derby thank you Mr
 
00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:37.640 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
um can you uh elaborate on the concerns
 
00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:44.200 align:start position:0%
that the um commission raised about
 
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
shotgun only towns well that it should
 
00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:49.240 align:start position:0%
be the responsibility of the individual
 
00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:51.800 align:start position:0%
towns uh just to it as it has been in
 
00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:52.510 align:start position:0%
towns uh just to it as it has been in
the

00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:52.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:38:56.190 --> 00:38:56.200 align:start position:0%
past that was openly discussed and um
 
00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
appre appreciate representative Harvey
 
00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:00.280 align:start position:0%
attending and understanding being there
 
00:39:06.589 --> 00:39:06.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
itself any further
 
00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you thank you
 
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
up that being said no further testimony
 
00:39:22.589 --> 00:39:22.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:22.599 --> 00:39:25.430 align:start position:0%
 
1077

00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
1077
 
00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:28.829 align:start position:0%
1077
good

00:39:28.829 --> 00:39:28.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
it okay and we'll open here oh we have
 
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
to wait sorry sorry sorry thank you
 
00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
thank you my my helpful fellow
 
00:39:40.309 --> 00:39:40.319 align:start position:0%
Representatives I appreciate that uh
 
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
we're on for the next one for 10:40 so
 
00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:55.400 --> 00:44:15.990 align:start position:0%
 
sit

00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
and might I say you've been doing a
 
00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
fantastic job this morning very
 
00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
much um I bring before your committee uh
 
00:44:27.309 --> 00:44:27.319 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1424 which a housekeeping
 
00:44:30.190 --> 00:44:30.200 align:start position:0%
bill um and I have an amendment on it
 
00:44:32.069 --> 00:44:32.079 align:start position:0%
before we even get further into this
 
00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
because I want to tell you that uh the
 
00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:36.520 align:start position:0%
intent of this was not to change the
 
00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
currently allowed calibers for handgun
 
00:44:41.109 --> 00:44:41.119 align:start position:0%
hunting it was just to list them in our
 
00:44:44.829 --> 00:44:44.839 align:start position:0%
RSA in an easier to manage way such that
 
00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
we don't have to go and add more
 
00:44:49.549 --> 00:44:49.559 align:start position:0%
calibers to the RSA every time another
 
00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
pistol caliber is developed and to also
 
00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
at the same time fix the error in the
 
00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
RSA as it currently is because current
 
00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:01.000 align:start position:0%
it calls uh to allow for a 50 uh caliber
 
00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
magnum which doesn't exist the caliber
 
00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:05.240 align:start position:0%
is actually called a 500 Smith and
 
00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
Wesson which is a 50 caliber handgun
 
00:45:10.349 --> 00:45:10.359 align:start position:0%
round that is permissible for hunting
 
00:45:12.349 --> 00:45:12.359 align:start position:0%
and it was something we added about six
 
00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:15.800 align:start position:0%
years ago maybe eight because Smith and
 
00:45:17.589 --> 00:45:17.599 align:start position:0%
Wesson came out with their 50 caliber
 
00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
handgun however I nobody realized that
 
00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
we had it listed in the RSA as 50
 
00:45:24.829 --> 00:45:24.839 align:start position:0%
caliber magnum which doesn't exist it's
 
00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:27.160 align:start position:0%
actually called a 500 Smith and Wesson
 
00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
so when I was talking with the fishing
 
00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
game department and and uh Colonel
 
00:45:34.069 --> 00:45:34.079 align:start position:0%
Jordan um I had the idea that I said
 
00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
well what if we just put everything
 
00:45:38.069 --> 00:45:38.079 align:start position:0%
bigger than this and we'll take the
 
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
smallest ethical hunting handgun round
 
00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:42.200 align:start position:0%
so that anything bigger is is allowable
 
00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
because it's all ethical for handgun
 
00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
hunting now keep in mind we're not
 
00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
talking about designated handgun hunting
 
00:45:48.190 --> 00:45:48.200 align:start position:0%
zones here this is throughout the whole
 
00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
state this is just saying if you're
 
00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:51.720 align:start position:0%
using a handgun instead of a rifle these
 
00:45:53.349 --> 00:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
are the types of handgun calibers you
 
00:45:56.990 --> 00:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
can use and uh uh that's why it's called
 
00:45:59.150 --> 00:45:59.160 align:start position:0%
pistols permitted on the
 
00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
RSA um any pistol that wasn't listed
 
00:46:04.349 --> 00:46:04.359 align:start position:0%
here you could not Hunt game with but
 
00:46:05.549 --> 00:46:05.559 align:start position:0%
every time they came out with something
 
00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:07.400 align:start position:0%
like the 50 caliber Smith and Wesson
 
00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
that they call the 500 Smith and Wesson
 
00:46:11.829 --> 00:46:11.839 align:start position:0%
we had to go and open the law up and add
 
00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:14.200 align:start position:0%
that to the list so rather than do that
 
00:46:17.710 --> 00:46:17.720 align:start position:0%
all the time I wrote it this way now if
 
00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
you look at the original list you'll see
 
00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
that at the end of the list well not
 
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
really even the end of the list near the
 
00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
end of the list there's something called
 
00:46:29.109 --> 00:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
a 327 Federal Magnum and because they
 
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
listed it out of order it wasn't lower
 
00:46:34.069 --> 00:46:34.079 align:start position:0%
than the 357
 
00:46:37.829 --> 00:46:37.839 align:start position:0%
Magnum um I left it off by mistake
 
00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
because anything it says any caliber 38
 
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
or 357 and greater and obviously 327 is
 
00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
smaller than 38 357 so it would have
 
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
been suddenly illegal to use that and
 
00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:50.200 align:start position:0%
we've allowed people to do it all this
 
00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
time we didn't want to leave that off so
 
00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:55.480 align:start position:0%
my Amendment says uh 327 Federal Magnum
 
00:46:58.910 --> 00:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
and any caliber 38/357 and greater
 
00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
simple change just to make sure we don't
 
00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
exclude that one that we've always
 
00:47:05.470 --> 00:47:05.480 align:start position:0%
allowed people to hunt with but we
 
00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
didn't want to say that was the smallest
 
00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
because there are calibers between 327
 
00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:13.960 align:start position:0%
and 357 that are not suitable for
 
00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
handgun um mainly because they don't
 
00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
have a lot of power even if they've got
 
00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
a larger bullet right taking the game
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
depends not only on the size of the
 
00:47:26.349 --> 00:47:26.359 align:start position:0%
bullet but the amount of
 
00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
um foot pounds that you deliver
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
downrange the the amount of force that
 
00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:33.240 align:start position:0%
it hits the animal with and
 
00:47:35.829 --> 00:47:35.839 align:start position:0%
um so we didn't want to accidentally end
 
00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
up with people hunting with a round that
 
00:47:42.109 --> 00:47:42.119 align:start position:0%
was not uh suitable such as a
 
00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
35 um or
 
00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
something you need to have that 38 357
 
00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
is the minimum but we'll still allow the
 
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
327 and so that's that I'll take any
 
00:47:59.030 --> 00:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
representative Harvey so this is another
 
00:48:04.069 --> 00:48:04.079 align:start position:0%
one that the fishing game has opposed do
 
00:48:06.829 --> 00:48:06.839 align:start position:0%
you know why yes actually um I got a
 
00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
call from the director and he said and I
 
00:48:10.589 --> 00:48:10.599 align:start position:0%
will tell you originally The Fish and
 
00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
Game Commission was in was uh supportive
 
00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
of this and actually uh the department
 
00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
was the one that I worked out the
 
00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
language with and the director called me
 
00:48:21.150 --> 00:48:21.160 align:start position:0%
he said I'm extremely sorry but the
 
00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:22.680 align:start position:0%
commission came down and said they don't
 
00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
want to talk about any of these um gun
 
00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
bills in an election
 
00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
year that's what I heard so um the
 
00:48:35.549 --> 00:48:35.559 align:start position:0%
department is not against this they
 
00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
actually asked for it we do have to fix
 
00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
the 50 caliber mistake that's in the law
 
00:48:42.349 --> 00:48:42.359 align:start position:0%
anyway and we want to make it easier to
 
00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:44.440 align:start position:0%
maintain this list going forward by not
 
00:48:46.069 --> 00:48:46.079 align:start position:0%
having to list every single caliber
 
00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
that's allowed and um so as with many
 
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
bills in the past we've had a vote from
 
00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:53.160 align:start position:0%
the commission where the majority of the
 
00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:54.640 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and I'm not sure if every
 
00:48:56.829 --> 00:48:56.839 align:start position:0%
commissioner was unanimous on it but a
 
00:48:59.109 --> 00:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
majority of them decided let's just kill
 
00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
all the gun bills this
 
00:49:09.589 --> 00:49:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:12.190 --> 00:49:12.200 align:start position:0%
understanding any other questions yeah
 
00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
any further questions uh representative
 
00:49:16.670 --> 00:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
Derby thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:49:20.349 --> 00:49:20.359 align:start position:0%
taking my question um would this uh
 
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
include a 38 special and do you think
 
00:49:25.069 --> 00:49:25.079 align:start position:0%
that a 38 special is um suitable for
 
00:49:26.510 --> 00:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
deer hunting
 
00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:28.280 align:start position:0%
no it would not it would be a 38 a
 
00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:29.190 align:start position:0%
no it would not it would be a 38 a
regular

00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
regular
 
00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:32.079 align:start position:0%
38357 a 38 special specifically has to
 
00:49:33.549 --> 00:49:33.559 align:start position:0%
have the word special next to it because
 
00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:45.109 --> 00:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
cartridge okay um can follow up um thank
 
00:49:48.829 --> 00:49:48.839 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair very naive question how how
 
00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
in the law would um 38 357 not include
 
00:49:57.670 --> 00:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
um 38 special because it's it's anything
 
00:50:00.670 --> 00:50:00.680 align:start position:0%
at that caliber so let me explain to you
 
00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
if if I said that you could use a 22
 
00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
long rifle for something you would not
 
00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
be able to use a 22 short which is the
 
00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
same round but only it's really tiny you
 
00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to use a 22 um Magnum
 
00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
which is much bigger if we said
 
00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
specifically 22 long rifle the 38
 
00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:24.200 align:start position:0%
Special is a specific cartridge if you
 
00:50:25.950 --> 00:50:25.960 align:start position:0%
go and buy 38 Special
 
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be the same size as
 
00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
a standard
 
00:50:31.309 --> 00:50:31.319 align:start position:0%
38 and it's designated that way
 
00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:33.160 align:start position:0%
purposefully so if we wanted to include
 
00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
38 Special we would have to specifically
 
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
include the word special in here after
 
00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
38 to make sure it was included the same
 
00:50:43.230 --> 00:50:43.240 align:start position:0%
as our laws for hunting uh with a 22 uh
 
00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
typically say 22 long rifle to exclude
 
00:50:51.390 --> 00:50:51.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
short uh any further
 
00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
questions uh seeing none we will close
 
00:50:59.270 --> 00:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
the hearing
 
00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:02.549 align:start position:0%
the hearing
on

00:51:02.549 --> 00:51:02.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:24.349 --> 00:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:24.359 --> 00:52:25.030 align:start position:0%
 
committee

00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
so as a reminder we're not on till 11:00
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:54.240 --> 01:04:56.109 align:start position:0%
 
11:

01:04:56.109 --> 01:04:56.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to open the hearing on HB
 
01:05:03.029 --> 01:05:03.039 align:start position:0%
1024 and I'm going to recognize
 
01:05:05.390 --> 01:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
representative Brian Cole the prime
 
01:05:08.750 --> 01:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor to present his Bill thank you Mr
 
01:05:10.829 --> 01:05:10.839 align:start position:0%
chairman committee's a fishing
 
01:05:14.309 --> 01:05:14.319 align:start position:0%
game so uh constituent brought me this
 
01:05:18.109 --> 01:05:18.119 align:start position:0%
bill and uh as I researched it air
 
01:05:20.789 --> 01:05:20.799 align:start position:0%
rifles have come a long way in evolution
 
01:05:23.029 --> 01:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
it's kind of like the evolution of a gun
 
01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:24.680 align:start position:0%
it's no longer a pel gun
 
01:05:27.349 --> 01:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
these air rifles like out in the Africa
 
01:05:28.789 --> 01:05:28.799 align:start position:0%
and the Amazon they'll take down a water
 
01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:30.920 align:start position:0%
buffalo now they're that
 
01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
powerful and so we wanted to legalize
 
01:05:35.510 --> 01:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
them for hunting up here in New
 
01:05:36.910 --> 01:05:36.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but we wanted to do it kind of
 
01:05:38.430 --> 01:05:38.440 align:start position:0%
like in baby
 
01:05:41.589 --> 01:05:41.599 align:start position:0%
steps so when I originally wrote it you
 
01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
know we have such a long window at OLS
 
01:05:46.029 --> 01:05:46.039 align:start position:0%
to write a bill so I got the bill in and
 
01:05:47.390 --> 01:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
then we worked on it so we came up with
 
01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:48.430 align:start position:0%
then we worked on it so we came up with
this

01:05:48.430 --> 01:05:48.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
amendment and we separated the calibers
 
01:05:54.309 --> 01:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
between small game and large game we
 
01:05:54.319 --> 01:05:55.349 align:start position:0%
between small game and large game we
defined

01:05:55.349 --> 01:05:55.359 align:start position:0%
defined
 
01:05:59.670 --> 01:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
it then we also wanted to make it so the
 
01:06:02.950 --> 01:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
fishing game could roll it out in zones
 
01:06:04.510 --> 01:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
so that's why we put the language in the
 
01:06:07.349 --> 01:06:07.359 align:start position:0%
last sentence there so they can kind of
 
01:06:09.910 --> 01:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
test Market it but what I'm kind of
 
01:06:12.190 --> 01:06:12.200 align:start position:0%
asking you to do is to interim study
 
01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
this because we still have to do some
 
01:06:17.029 --> 01:06:17.039 align:start position:0%
testing on the air rifles I want to
 
01:06:19.549 --> 01:06:19.559 align:start position:0%
prove The lethality of them make sure
 
01:06:21.269 --> 01:06:21.279 align:start position:0%
it's ethical and taking an animal here
 
01:06:24.750 --> 01:06:24.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so get everyone
 
01:06:25.870 --> 01:06:25.880 align:start position:0%
together I'm not going to be able to do
 
01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
that until probably Springtime so that's
 
01:06:29.349 --> 01:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
what I'm requesting this committee to do
 
01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
with this bill at this
 
01:06:34.589 --> 01:06:34.599 align:start position:0%
time sorry open any questions if you
 
01:06:38.950 --> 01:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
it Mr clerk uh thank you Mr chair uh
 
01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Cole for taking
 
01:06:45.390 --> 01:06:45.400 align:start position:0%
my question who who's going to be doing
 
01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:46.109 align:start position:0%
my question who who's going to be doing
the

01:06:46.109 --> 01:06:46.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:06:49.069 --> 01:06:49.079 align:start position:0%
testing uh we found Sig firearms in
 
01:06:50.670 --> 01:06:50.680 align:start position:0%
eping they're going to allow us to use
 
01:06:52.390 --> 01:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
their range and then we have a
 
01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
manufacturer who's developing he's
 
01:06:56.549 --> 01:06:56.559 align:start position:0%
already developed up to 50 caliber air
 
01:06:58.510 --> 01:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
rifles so we want to get together with
 
01:06:59.750 --> 01:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
fishing game we want to get together
 
01:07:01.349 --> 01:07:01.359 align:start position:0%
with the other commissions bring them
 
01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
down there take like ballistics gel and
 
01:07:06.829 --> 01:07:06.839 align:start position:0%
S the penetration of the Round And The
 
01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
lethality of the weapons to make sure
 
01:07:11.309 --> 01:07:11.319 align:start position:0%
like I said it's ethical and taking game
 
01:07:11.319 --> 01:07:12.230 align:start position:0%
like I said it's ethical and taking game
thank

01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:18.920 align:start position:0%
wette thank you for taking my question
 
01:07:20.750 --> 01:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
is there any plans or are there any
 
01:07:24.549 --> 01:07:24.559 align:start position:0%
plans from the manufacturers to um be
 
01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
part of the Pitman Robertson Act of
 
01:07:29.150 --> 01:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
conservation that the rest of the uh
 
01:07:30.670 --> 01:07:30.680 align:start position:0%
firearm manufacturers in this country
 
01:07:34.710 --> 01:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
are part of that had came up in this in
 
01:07:36.549 --> 01:07:36.559 align:start position:0%
thank you again to the chairman for
 
01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
pointing this out to me that's why we're
 
01:07:40.349 --> 01:07:40.359 align:start position:0%
allowing a fee to be charged if you want
 
01:07:42.390 --> 01:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
to use an air rifle so it'll cover that
 
01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
fee if and when they do put that into
 
01:07:47.470 --> 01:07:47.480 align:start position:0%
law in the federal law so the fishing
 
01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
game will have money to pay those fees
 
01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:56.069 --> 01:07:56.079 align:start position:0%
back representative Harvey than thank
 
01:07:58.069 --> 01:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you um for taking my
 
01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
question so um I I think I heard so
 
01:08:04.109 --> 01:08:04.119 align:start position:0%
you're testing for just tell me what
 
01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
you're testing for because I'm not sure
 
01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
if I heard it correctly if I go say a 30
 
01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
odd 6 is a typical caliber to take a
 
01:08:14.190 --> 01:08:14.200 align:start position:0%
deer down we want to make sure that the
 
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
air rifle that's a caliber 30 caliber
 
01:08:20.349 --> 01:08:20.359 align:start position:0%
has the same velocity same penetration
 
01:08:23.870 --> 01:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
same impact and killing power as a as a
 
01:08:26.189 --> 01:08:26.199 align:start position:0%
you know around with powder in it so the
 
01:08:28.390 --> 01:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
word you were using was lethality not
 
01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
legality no lethality yes yes we want to
 
01:08:33.070 --> 01:08:33.080 align:start position:0%
make sure it's a nice clean kill for the
 
01:08:35.829 --> 01:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
animal and there's no suffering right y
 
01:08:38.749 --> 01:08:38.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:41.829 --> 01:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
misheard representative Khan thank you
 
01:08:43.749 --> 01:08:43.759 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you representative
 
01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question um you mentioned that
 
01:08:51.829 --> 01:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
uh that uh you tried to introduce this
 
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and yeah rifle game a
 
01:08:58.550 --> 01:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
long way in these days is very powerful
 
01:09:00.910 --> 01:09:00.920 align:start position:0%
can you tell us what other state already
 
01:09:03.630 --> 01:09:03.640 align:start position:0%
using this you know legally I'm not
 
01:09:07.749 --> 01:09:07.759 align:start position:0%
aware of any other states thank
 
01:09:10.390 --> 01:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
you if the chair can jump in I believe
 
01:09:13.030 --> 01:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
Colorado allows it uh and I'm getting a
 
01:09:17.070 --> 01:09:17.080 align:start position:0%
nod from fishing game so um at least
 
01:09:19.269 --> 01:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
Colorado and and there may be Montana as
 
01:09:22.510 --> 01:09:22.520 align:start position:0%
well but I don't know for sure um that
 
01:09:23.950 --> 01:09:23.960 align:start position:0%
might be a question for fishing game
 
01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
when they testify okay thank you
 
01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:27.829 align:start position:0%
when they testify okay thank you
representative

01:09:27.829 --> 01:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:09:30.990 --> 01:09:31.000 align:start position:0%
perir thank you for taking my question
 
01:09:34.030 --> 01:09:34.040 align:start position:0%
um are we if you haven't even tested
 
01:09:38.030 --> 01:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
this uh uh air rifle yet are we jumping
 
01:09:40.269 --> 01:09:40.279 align:start position:0%
the gun with passing taking this bill up
 
01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
now should we wait a year and do it
 
01:09:43.309 --> 01:09:43.319 align:start position:0%
after you've done the testing that's why
 
01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
I'm asking I'm recommending interm study
 
01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
until we've performed the test and then
 
01:09:50.829 --> 01:09:50.839 align:start position:0%
you'll have your answer you don't want
 
01:09:54.350 --> 01:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
to just pull it um and not no I don't
 
01:09:56.189 --> 01:09:56.199 align:start position:0%
see any reason to we've come this far
 
01:09:58.390 --> 01:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
with it the Final Phase is basically
 
01:10:00.310 --> 01:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
testing it making sure it does what it
 
01:10:01.950 --> 01:10:01.960 align:start position:0%
says it's going to
 
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
you representative Darby thank you Mr
 
01:10:11.189 --> 01:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
um in the study um as I look a little
 
01:10:18.550 --> 01:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
into um air rifles it appears that the
 
01:10:20.830 --> 01:10:20.840 align:start position:0%
slug that these shoot come in come in
 
01:10:22.990 --> 01:10:23.000 align:start position:0%
different grains different weights and
 
01:10:24.870 --> 01:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
it um
 
01:10:26.830 --> 01:10:26.840 align:start position:0%
would the study uh evaluate different
 
01:10:29.390 --> 01:10:29.400 align:start position:0%
grains and how those might be sort of
 
01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
permitted I requested all the ballistics
 
01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
information on the rare FAL for each
 
01:10:36.270 --> 01:10:36.280 align:start position:0%
caliber be given so yeah all information
 
01:10:39.790 --> 01:10:39.800 align:start position:0%
will be available thank you
 
01:10:43.550 --> 01:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
yep any other questions for the
 
01:10:45.910 --> 01:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
sponsor seeing none thank you so much
 
01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:52.510 --> 01:10:52.520 align:start position:0%
committee and the chair will now
 
01:10:54.510 --> 01:10:54.520 align:start position:0%
recognize Colonel George from fishing
 
01:10:57.790 --> 01:10:57.800 align:start position:0%
game who's asked for two
 
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
minutes good morning and uh chairman
 
01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
Spain and members of the House fishing
 
01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
game resources nice to be in front of
 
01:11:05.229 --> 01:11:05.239 align:start position:0%
you again there's some new faces so
 
01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:08.440 align:start position:0%
welcome hopefully we uh we will be on
 
01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:10.360 align:start position:0%
good terms throughout the session that's
 
01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
what we that's what I hope for so I was
 
01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
thrown into this bill I wasn't a uh the
 
01:11:18.510 --> 01:11:18.520 align:start position:0%
prime person to represent our the
 
01:11:20.030 --> 01:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
Department's opinion but I'm here to
 
01:11:22.149 --> 01:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
represent the commission's position and
 
01:11:23.870 --> 01:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
the commission took the position of
 
01:11:26.350 --> 01:11:26.360 align:start position:0%
opposition to this but they did that
 
01:11:28.630 --> 01:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
basically I think for some of the re and
 
01:11:30.990 --> 01:11:31.000 align:start position:0%
we oppose it we the staff Wildlife staff
 
01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
and law enforcement for a lot of the
 
01:11:35.229 --> 01:11:35.239 align:start position:0%
reasons that we're already talking about
 
01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
um I think and it's just my we're
 
01:11:39.910 --> 01:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
concerned about ethical killing uh we
 
01:11:41.110 --> 01:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we don't put
 
01:11:42.350 --> 01:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
something out there that people will
 
01:11:45.629 --> 01:11:45.639 align:start position:0%
lose animals with um we are concerned
 
01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
about air pressures calibers what
 
01:11:49.950 --> 01:11:49.960 align:start position:0%
happens when you load these things in a
 
01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
warmed environment and then go out into
 
01:11:54.629 --> 01:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
the cold does it still high will it have
 
01:11:56.830 --> 01:11:56.840 align:start position:0%
the killing capacity that it had in and
 
01:11:58.350 --> 01:11:58.360 align:start position:0%
I don't we don't know the answers to any
 
01:12:01.270 --> 01:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
of those so interim study made good
 
01:12:03.870 --> 01:12:03.880 align:start position:0%
sense to take a look at it and attend
 
01:12:06.790 --> 01:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
the testing of it to see um I'm not
 
01:12:08.110 --> 01:12:08.120 align:start position:0%
going to say that we would be willing to
 
01:12:09.669 --> 01:12:09.679 align:start position:0%
change our opinion but we certainly are
 
01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
willing to open-minded enough to see the
 
01:12:13.510 --> 01:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
testing and to see if it is something
 
01:12:16.110 --> 01:12:16.120 align:start position:0%
that can be used I don't know of any
 
01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
issue with using it as far as law
 
01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement goes as long as we don't get
 
01:12:24.110 --> 01:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
into um you know into a situ ation where
 
01:12:25.750 --> 01:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
we in the field are going to have to
 
01:12:27.590 --> 01:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
test the rifles I don't know how we
 
01:12:30.149 --> 01:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
would do that so we have to be confident
 
01:12:32.270 --> 01:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
I think uh that these things will do
 
01:12:35.149 --> 01:12:35.159 align:start position:0%
what they say they will do um the
 
01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
license fee came in kind of after our
 
01:12:38.990 --> 01:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
vote so we hadn't taken a position on
 
01:12:40.830 --> 01:12:40.840 align:start position:0%
that so I think the commission and I
 
01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
don't there are commission members here
 
01:12:45.070 --> 01:12:45.080 align:start position:0%
but I think they are open to considering
 
01:12:46.830 --> 01:12:46.840 align:start position:0%
looking at it studying it and then
 
01:12:51.390 --> 01:12:51.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
that are there any questions for the
 
01:12:56.070 --> 01:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
colonel um actually let me start out
 
01:12:58.430 --> 01:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
with a couple if I might Colonel Jordan
 
01:12:59.750 --> 01:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
sure did you get a chance to see the
 
01:13:03.550 --> 01:13:03.560 align:start position:0%
amendment I did okay um I worked with
 
01:13:04.830 --> 01:13:04.840 align:start position:0%
the Prime on this because there were a
 
01:13:06.350 --> 01:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
lot of errors in the original as you can
 
01:13:08.229 --> 01:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
imagine they even had turkeys included
 
01:13:11.070 --> 01:13:11.080 align:start position:0%
in there which is just a non-starter
 
01:13:13.870 --> 01:13:13.880 align:start position:0%
yeah um the Pitman Robertson act not
 
01:13:17.790 --> 01:13:17.800 align:start position:0%
giving any money to fishing game um made
 
01:13:20.510 --> 01:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
me more likely to recommend that fish
 
01:13:22.910 --> 01:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
and game be allowed to create a tag for
 
01:13:24.790 --> 01:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
this much the muzzle loader tag would
 
01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
the department have a problem with a tag
 
01:13:28.350 --> 01:13:28.360 align:start position:0%
that provides extra income law
 
01:13:30.070 --> 01:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement wouldn't I don't know I
 
01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
can't speak for the commission because I
 
01:13:33.189 --> 01:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
don't know that we put that before them
 
01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
but I don't I don't know why they would
 
01:13:37.950 --> 01:13:37.960 align:start position:0%
oppose that as long as we can operate it
 
01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:39.800 align:start position:0%
uh and it can be done in our business
 
01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
division as just an additional tag
 
01:13:43.229 --> 01:13:43.239 align:start position:0%
similar to what we've done with other
 
01:13:45.629 --> 01:13:45.639 align:start position:0%
tags we we are doing that now so I would
 
01:13:47.430 --> 01:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
assume we could do that but I I don't
 
01:13:48.510 --> 01:13:48.520 align:start position:0%
want to tell you the commission's good
 
01:13:49.870 --> 01:13:49.880 align:start position:0%
with it because I haven't run it before
 
01:13:52.510 --> 01:13:52.520 align:start position:0%
them fair enough and a followup to uh
 
01:13:53.990 --> 01:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
would be the question that was asked
 
01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
earlier about other states do you know
 
01:13:57.750 --> 01:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
of any others besides of Colorado please
 
01:13:59.510 --> 01:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
the only one I know of is Colorado but I
 
01:14:01.189 --> 01:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
haven't I haven't gone online and looked
 
01:14:02.990 --> 01:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
at that I know Colorado uses it and
 
01:14:05.070 --> 01:14:05.080 align:start position:0%
they've had they've not had any reported
 
01:14:08.030 --> 01:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
issues that I could find so um so I
 
01:14:09.310 --> 01:14:09.320 align:start position:0%
don't but I don't know of any other
 
01:14:11.910 --> 01:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
state thank you any questions for the
 
01:14:14.350 --> 01:14:14.360 align:start position:0%
colonel representative Ford you have yet
 
01:14:16.910 --> 01:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
to speak today go for it thank you Mr
 
01:14:19.470 --> 01:14:19.480 align:start position:0%
chairman um thank you for taking my
 
01:14:22.030 --> 01:14:22.040 align:start position:0%
question sure
 
01:14:25.669 --> 01:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
how how how long should this study or
 
01:14:28.510 --> 01:14:28.520 align:start position:0%
study or Research into the air rifles
 
01:14:31.550 --> 01:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
would you feel confident and confident
 
01:14:34.110 --> 01:14:34.120 align:start position:0%
enough to say like yes pass this bill
 
01:14:35.709 --> 01:14:35.719 align:start position:0%
we've tested it and we're good to go how
 
01:14:37.709 --> 01:14:37.719 align:start position:0%
long that's a great question I think if
 
01:14:39.990 --> 01:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
all of our concerns are addressed things
 
01:14:42.709 --> 01:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
like ballistics changing temperatures
 
01:14:44.430 --> 01:14:44.440 align:start position:0%
what happens when the pressure
 
01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
drops um you know how much of a change
 
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
does that make all of those things when
 
01:14:52.229 --> 01:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
all of those questions are answered um I
 
01:14:53.669 --> 01:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
would say that we would be comtable I
 
01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
will tell you this I will be very vocal
 
01:14:57.390 --> 01:14:57.400 align:start position:0%
if we're not comfortable if we still
 
01:14:59.189 --> 01:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
have issues I would be concerned about
 
01:15:00.910 --> 01:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
that cuz what we don't want I don't
 
01:15:03.070 --> 01:15:03.080 align:start position:0%
think is wounded animals running around
 
01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
the the state or people getting injured
 
01:15:08.550 --> 01:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
I am I'm fairly confident personally
 
01:15:10.669 --> 01:15:10.679 align:start position:0%
fairly confident that the manufacturers
 
01:15:12.189 --> 01:15:12.199 align:start position:0%
can answer those questions if we give
 
01:15:13.950 --> 01:15:13.960 align:start position:0%
them the opportunity I just want to see
 
01:15:16.149 --> 01:15:16.159 align:start position:0%
it we want to see it and I'd like to
 
01:15:17.510 --> 01:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
present that to our commission
 
01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:19.400 align:start position:0%
afterwards and and if everybody's on
 
01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
board with it and those questions have
 
01:15:22.990 --> 01:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
been answered um that's a that's a tough
 
01:15:25.990 --> 01:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
question question to ask um but we want
 
01:15:27.790 --> 01:15:27.800 align:start position:0%
to be satisfied it will do the job that
 
01:15:29.629 --> 01:15:29.639 align:start position:0%
we're asking it to do and if they do
 
01:15:32.950 --> 01:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
that we'd be good with it I
 
01:15:34.990 --> 01:15:35.000 align:start position:0%
think any further questions
 
01:15:37.390 --> 01:15:37.400 align:start position:0%
representative Darby thank you thank you
 
01:15:38.629 --> 01:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
01:15:40.110 --> 01:15:40.120 align:start position:0%
question yes
 
01:15:43.790 --> 01:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
sir um are there any uh concerns about
 
01:15:45.950 --> 01:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
um night hunting or poaching um since
 
01:15:49.790 --> 01:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
this would you know the this has much uh
 
01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
the noise from this would be much much
 
01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
less right and I didn't see any in in
 
01:15:57.070 --> 01:15:57.080 align:start position:0%
this amendment or the original Bill any
 
01:15:59.070 --> 01:15:59.080 align:start position:0%
adjustment to the night hunting standard
 
01:16:03.790 --> 01:16:03.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
for C you know for night hunting so
 
01:16:09.990 --> 01:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
that's a good question as well and uh at
 
01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
the risk of getting slapped by many
 
01:16:13.790 --> 01:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
older wardens who would have a very
 
01:16:15.910 --> 01:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
different opinion who I worked with for
 
01:16:18.390 --> 01:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
years those days have kind of gone away
 
01:16:20.510 --> 01:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
and I'll tell you why they have uh
 
01:16:22.510 --> 01:16:22.520 align:start position:0%
people are using night vision today
 
01:16:23.910 --> 01:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
which is something we never thought we'd
 
01:16:26.470 --> 01:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
see they do it routinely they are using
 
01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:28.760 align:start position:0%
they can use silencers I fought that in
 
01:16:30.709 --> 01:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
this committee very hard because I felt
 
01:16:33.669 --> 01:16:33.679 align:start position:0%
that that was going to increase uh the
 
01:16:35.790 --> 01:16:35.800 align:start position:0%
the ability for some to poach and maybe
 
01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
it does um but I've also found that
 
01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
prior to that and after that people use
 
01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
silencers anyway the poachers will do
 
01:16:47.390 --> 01:16:47.400 align:start position:0%
this anyway um we we fought hard I
 
01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
remember years and years ago against
 
01:16:50.830 --> 01:16:50.840 align:start position:0%
crossbows thinking the same thing people
 
01:16:52.750 --> 01:16:52.760 align:start position:0%
will go out at night excuse me and use a
 
01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:54.310 align:start position:0%
will go out at night excuse me and use a
cross

01:16:54.310 --> 01:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
cross
 
01:16:57.990 --> 01:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
again I those are are fears that I don't
 
01:16:59.830 --> 01:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
want to say didn't occur cuz I think
 
01:17:01.149 --> 01:17:01.159 align:start position:0%
they did but it didn't do it in the
 
01:17:04.070 --> 01:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
numbers that I predicted it would uh
 
01:17:06.950 --> 01:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
which is was embarrassing frankly so I
 
01:17:09.229 --> 01:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
thought it would triple it and it didn't
 
01:17:11.669 --> 01:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
I think there is a mindset that these
 
01:17:13.870 --> 01:17:13.880 align:start position:0%
particular individuals um you know we
 
01:17:15.229 --> 01:17:15.239 align:start position:0%
made cases recently where they were
 
01:17:17.149 --> 01:17:17.159 align:start position:0%
using all kinds of Technology that's
 
01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
never reached this committee yet that
 
01:17:21.750 --> 01:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
will that's pretty scary so I don't know
 
01:17:23.550 --> 01:17:23.560 align:start position:0%
that it would increase that
 
01:17:27.470 --> 01:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
um it may answer it may answer some
 
01:17:29.590 --> 01:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
issues we have in some of our more urban
 
01:17:32.030 --> 01:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
areas where gunshots go off and frighten
 
01:17:33.390 --> 01:17:33.400 align:start position:0%
people because I get a lot of calls
 
01:17:35.550 --> 01:17:35.560 align:start position:0%
about that even though hunting is one of
 
01:17:37.430 --> 01:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
the safest Sports you can and we can
 
01:17:39.669 --> 01:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
prove that um people are concerned they
 
01:17:41.110 --> 01:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
hear it go off so I don't know maybe
 
01:17:42.510 --> 01:17:42.520 align:start position:0%
this would address some of that in some
 
01:17:44.830 --> 01:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
of the more congested areas so I I think
 
01:17:46.510 --> 01:17:46.520 align:start position:0%
it could go either way but I don't see
 
01:17:49.149 --> 01:17:49.159 align:start position:0%
it personally I don't see it increasing
 
01:17:52.110 --> 01:17:52.120 align:start position:0%
poaching from where we are poaching is
 
01:17:53.350 --> 01:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
Alive and Well by the way way I just
 
01:17:56.110 --> 01:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
want to tell the committee we made 59 n
 
01:17:58.070 --> 01:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
hunting cases last fall that's
 
01:18:00.110 --> 01:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
unbelievable that's a lot of night
 
01:18:01.629 --> 01:18:01.639 align:start position:0%
hunting cases our technology has
 
01:18:03.790 --> 01:18:03.800 align:start position:0%
improved quite frankly our officers are
 
01:18:05.790 --> 01:18:05.800 align:start position:0%
better at it than I ever was I think
 
01:18:07.310 --> 01:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
they're they're a little more Savvy on
 
01:18:09.709 --> 01:18:09.719 align:start position:0%
the technology but it just told me that
 
01:18:14.430 --> 01:18:14.440 align:start position:0%
it's alive and well yeah good work
 
01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
thanks representative
 
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
AAR thank you Mr chairman and once again
 
01:18:21.709 --> 01:18:21.719 align:start position:0%
welcome to the committee thank you very
 
01:18:23.550 --> 01:18:23.560 align:start position:0%
much um
 
01:18:26.110 --> 01:18:26.120 align:start position:0%
this question is not for the officer but
 
01:18:28.790 --> 01:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
um a comment to the commission is that
 
01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
allowed I would ask you to hold that uh
 
01:18:33.550 --> 01:18:33.560 align:start position:0%
if the commission comes up to discuss we
 
01:18:36.070 --> 01:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
would uh go ahead and welcome that um
 
01:18:39.070 --> 01:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
question for the commission uh comments
 
01:18:40.870 --> 01:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be something we would do during
 
01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:41.709 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be something we would do during
the

01:18:41.709 --> 01:18:41.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:50.870 --> 01:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
colonel uh thank you Mr chair Mr clerk
 
01:18:53.870 --> 01:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
sorry I had my mic off thank you uh
 
01:18:55.310 --> 01:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
welcome Colonel nice to see you thank
 
01:18:59.310 --> 01:18:59.320 align:start position:0%
you sir good to see you um can you for
 
01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
me elaborate a little bit more on what I
 
01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
asked uh representative Cole about the
 
01:19:06.669 --> 01:19:06.679 align:start position:0%
makeup of who's doing the testing are
 
01:19:08.149 --> 01:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
are is fishing aim going to be
 
01:19:09.790 --> 01:19:09.800 align:start position:0%
intimately involved in this testing
 
01:19:12.430 --> 01:19:12.440 align:start position:0%
process or as an observer probably more
 
01:19:14.870 --> 01:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
as an observer I would hope that it that
 
01:19:16.950 --> 01:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
we would be I would expect and hope that
 
01:19:19.270 --> 01:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
we will be able to have input on it but
 
01:19:21.149 --> 01:19:21.159 align:start position:0%
no we the we would leave this to the
 
01:19:22.950 --> 01:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
manufacturers to demonstrate their
 
01:19:25.470 --> 01:19:25.480 align:start position:0%
prodct thank you and I can add to that I
 
01:19:27.229 --> 01:19:27.239 align:start position:0%
was working with the prime sponsor on
 
01:19:29.110 --> 01:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
making sure he could set this up David
 
01:19:31.550 --> 01:19:31.560 align:start position:0%
czy isn't with Sig anymore right if you
 
01:19:33.070 --> 01:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
remember he was one of the ones behind
 
01:19:34.790 --> 01:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
the suppressor bill that I was
 
01:19:37.629 --> 01:19:37.639 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of um so we've got a
 
01:19:39.470 --> 01:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
different contact over there but we
 
01:19:41.229 --> 01:19:41.239 align:start position:0%
would indeed open this not only to the
 
01:19:43.229 --> 01:19:43.239 align:start position:0%
fish and game but uh you know not
 
01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
everybody at fish and game but a few a
 
01:19:47.149 --> 01:19:47.159 align:start position:0%
few of you right sure um but the
 
01:19:48.629 --> 01:19:48.639 align:start position:0%
commission I believe would be invited as
 
01:19:49.790 --> 01:19:49.800 align:start position:0%
well for anyone who wanted to come and
 
01:19:50.910 --> 01:19:50.920 align:start position:0%
see it I think that would be important
 
01:19:53.229 --> 01:19:53.239 align:start position:0%
to do that yeah absolutely yeah um and
 
01:19:55.510 --> 01:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
that would allow for Hands-On yes as
 
01:19:57.270 --> 01:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
well so that everyone could have the
 
01:20:00.830 --> 01:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
experience of of firing the the air gun
 
01:20:02.550 --> 01:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
and bringing their concerns to bringing
 
01:20:04.750 --> 01:20:04.760 align:start position:0%
their concerns to the manufacturer and
 
01:20:07.870 --> 01:20:07.880 align:start position:0%
the range operators and uh witnessing
 
01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
firsthand the penetration in the
 
01:20:13.070 --> 01:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
ballistic gelatin and all that right uh
 
01:20:15.229 --> 01:20:15.239 align:start position:0%
and I think that's just responsible to
 
01:20:19.070 --> 01:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
do any further questions seeing none
 
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:26.229 align:start position:0%
 
much

01:20:26.229 --> 01:20:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:28.470 --> 01:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
the commission will now call or
 
01:20:30.149 --> 01:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
recognize or the the committee will now
 
01:20:40.350 --> 01:20:40.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:42.430 --> 01:20:42.440 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you Mr chairman good morning
 
01:20:43.669 --> 01:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
ladies and gentlemen appreciate the
 
01:20:46.070 --> 01:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to uh comment on this bill
 
01:20:47.550 --> 01:20:47.560 align:start position:0%
uh my name is Fred bird I'm the
 
01:20:49.550 --> 01:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
assistant manager for the north eastern
 
01:20:50.950 --> 01:20:50.960 align:start position:0%

01:20:53.910 --> 01:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
Foundation I manage uh Maryland North I
 
01:20:55.390 --> 01:20:55.400 align:start position:0%
am a New Hampshire resident and active
 
01:20:58.750 --> 01:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
Sportsman and uh prior straford County
 
01:20:59.870 --> 01:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
Commissioner for fishing game
 
01:21:03.149 --> 01:21:03.159 align:start position:0%
representing 137,000 constituents um for
 
01:21:04.310 --> 01:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
many of the reasons that have already
 
01:21:06.709 --> 01:21:06.719 align:start position:0%
been articulated our main reason uh
 
01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
we're recommending amendments this is a
 
01:21:11.110 --> 01:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
great opportunity for Access uh but for
 
01:21:12.669 --> 01:21:12.679 align:start position:0%
the pr dollars now I we will let you
 
01:21:16.430 --> 01:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
know last year uh the state uh through
 
01:21:18.669 --> 01:21:18.679 align:start position:0%
Pitman Robinson and in combination with
 
01:21:22.390 --> 01:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
license sales saw $24.5 million come to
 
01:21:24.910 --> 01:21:24.920 align:start position:0%
the the agency the state fishing game to
 
01:21:27.229 --> 01:21:27.239 align:start position:0%
help uh run the agency that's a pretty
 
01:21:29.669 --> 01:21:29.679 align:start position:0%
big number obviously the concern is with
 
01:21:31.510 --> 01:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
this passing and without that you've
 
01:21:34.110 --> 01:21:34.120 align:start position:0%
heard a couple times a tag an air gun
 
01:21:37.229 --> 01:21:37.239 align:start position:0%
tag um if if Sportsmen and women decided
 
01:21:38.790 --> 01:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
to go the way of the air gun and and
 
01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
leave their other uh already excise tax
 
01:21:44.270 --> 01:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
Firearms we could lose out on that $7.2
 
01:21:46.070 --> 01:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
million from
 
01:21:51.030 --> 01:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
PR um I would also like to call to your
 
01:21:52.510 --> 01:21:52.520 align:start position:0%
attention I I did not know that there
 
01:21:54.790 --> 01:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
was was an amended version I I was going
 
01:21:56.030 --> 01:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
to I didn't want to interrupt you but I
 
01:21:57.390 --> 01:21:57.400 align:start position:0%
was going to ask if you'd like to see a
 
01:22:00.910 --> 01:22:00.920 align:start position:0%
copy that would be fantastic one of my
 
01:22:02.990 --> 01:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative Mooney can you pass
 
01:22:05.229 --> 01:22:05.239 align:start position:0%
yeah thank
 
01:22:07.310 --> 01:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
you there were a number of concerns
 
01:22:08.709 --> 01:22:08.719 align:start position:0%
addressed by the amendment such as the
 
01:22:10.030 --> 01:22:10.040 align:start position:0%
hunting of turkeys because there aren't
 
01:22:11.790 --> 01:22:11.800 align:start position:0%
any air shotguns out that I know of
 
01:22:13.709 --> 01:22:13.719 align:start position:0%
right now and um so that would just be a
 
01:22:15.950 --> 01:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
non-starter but also the uh the the
 
01:22:18.430 --> 01:22:18.440 align:start position:0%
range of calibers did not fit for all
 
01:22:20.750 --> 01:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
game uh we literally would not want
 
01:22:25.110 --> 01:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
somebody shooting um you know uh rabbits
 
01:22:29.030 --> 01:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
with um a water buffalo sure right shot
 
01:22:31.310 --> 01:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
nor would we want somebody shooting um
 
01:22:32.950 --> 01:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
the deer with something that's too small
 
01:22:34.709 --> 01:22:34.719 align:start position:0%
so it's divided up that's exactly right
 
01:22:36.910 --> 01:22:36.920 align:start position:0%
and to that point Mr chairman um you
 
01:22:37.990 --> 01:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
know we would recommend that the
 
01:22:40.110 --> 01:22:40.120 align:start position:0%
authority remain with the department and
 
01:22:42.510 --> 01:22:42.520 align:start position:0%
the commission to to allow for that rule
 
01:22:44.470 --> 01:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
making obviously you know to your point
 
01:22:46.910 --> 01:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
we don't want to blow up rabbits with
 
01:22:48.830 --> 01:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
large calibers but also allowing for
 
01:22:51.430 --> 01:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
those small game calendars calibers 22
 
01:22:54.070 --> 01:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
1.77 to do do that small game cuz they
 
01:22:57.310 --> 01:22:57.320 align:start position:0%
they are uh ethical and the effect the
 
01:22:58.709 --> 01:22:58.719 align:start position:0%
efficiency of those rounds are more than
 
01:23:00.310 --> 01:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
enough for small game and obviously
 
01:23:02.470 --> 01:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
allowing that range uh and I agree with
 
01:23:05.550 --> 01:23:05.560 align:start position:0%
you in the concern of the Turkey um I do
 
01:23:07.950 --> 01:23:07.960 align:start position:0%
know that California allows for air guns
 
01:23:09.750 --> 01:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
on Turkey um for those that are
 
01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
unfamiliar uh we have the authorized
 
01:23:14.629 --> 01:23:14.639 align:start position:0%
loads in the state of New Hampshire that
 
01:23:16.430 --> 01:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
are shotgun loads and the load comes out
 
01:23:19.070 --> 01:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
in a conical shape to envelop the head
 
01:23:20.510 --> 01:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
of the turkey the soft fleshy part of
 
01:23:22.550 --> 01:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
the turkey this is for an effective
 
01:23:25.669 --> 01:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
lethal kill of a wild turkey turkeys
 
01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
feather make up the body doing body
 
01:23:30.750 --> 01:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
shots with a a shotgun load or in this
 
01:23:32.669 --> 01:23:32.679 align:start position:0%
case a small caliber air rifle just
 
01:23:35.629 --> 01:23:35.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't is not effective it's built like
 
01:23:37.790 --> 01:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
Kevlar and largely bounces off the bird
 
01:23:39.790 --> 01:23:39.800 align:start position:0%
so we want to make sure that if we're
 
01:23:41.189 --> 01:23:41.199 align:start position:0%
out there harvesting that we do it
 
01:23:43.310 --> 01:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
quickly ethically and and honor the
 
01:23:46.350 --> 01:23:46.360 align:start position:0%
animal um because a lot of this has been
 
01:23:47.910 --> 01:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
already taken care of with the
 
01:23:49.590 --> 01:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
Amendments I did want to answer some of
 
01:23:52.470 --> 01:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
the the commission's um questions as as
 
01:23:54.270 --> 01:23:54.280 align:start position:0%
it pertains to other states if you
 
01:23:58.470 --> 01:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
would feel free okay very good um in
 
01:24:01.470 --> 01:24:01.480 align:start position:0%
2019 in Georgia by way of Senate Bill 72
 
01:24:03.750 --> 01:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
and in Virginia by way of House Bill
 
01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
1393 and Senate Bill
 
01:24:09.629 --> 01:24:09.639 align:start position:0%

01:24:12.669 --> 01:24:12.679 align:start position:0%
authorize uh the use of air guns in
 
01:24:15.510 --> 01:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
2022 the Utah Governor Spencer Cox
 
01:24:19.070 --> 01:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
signed Senate Bill 205 to allow air guns
 
01:24:23.030 --> 01:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
and then uh in 2022 Oklahoma author R by
 
01:24:26.669 --> 01:24:26.679 align:start position:0%
way of 7 uh 1571 Senate Bill the use of
 
01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
air a Aero air guns uh essentially in
 
01:24:32.350 --> 01:24:32.360 align:start position:0%
the same makeup of air gun so uh and
 
01:24:34.510 --> 01:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
then to the Colonel's Point Colorado as
 
01:24:36.390 --> 01:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
I understand and Montana do the same
 
01:24:38.910 --> 01:24:38.920 align:start position:0%
thing so there is there is case out here
 
01:24:40.709 --> 01:24:40.719 align:start position:0%
there there has been legislation passed
 
01:24:42.950 --> 01:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
all across the country for this and with
 
01:24:44.790 --> 01:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
the right measures and the right testing
 
01:24:46.709 --> 01:24:46.719 align:start position:0%
that that's proved positive for this
 
01:24:48.510 --> 01:24:48.520 align:start position:0%
this body um I think this is something
 
01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
we can move forward with
 
01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:53.470 align:start position:0%
we can move forward with

know sure we can do that right before we
 
01:26:24.350 --> 01:26:24.360 align:start position:0%
start again yeah it has something to you
 
01:26:26.870 --> 01:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
know it's important and it's it's why I
 
01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
made I made sure that the prime sponsor
 
01:26:30.430 --> 01:26:30.440 align:start position:0%
put in a tag situation I said because
 
01:26:32.189 --> 01:26:32.199 align:start position:0%
this isn't going to apply the vice chair
 
01:26:33.669 --> 01:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
and I discussed this it was one of the
 
01:26:35.430 --> 01:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
things we said straight out is you know
 
01:26:36.709 --> 01:26:36.719 align:start position:0%
this has to we're not getting any money
 
01:26:38.270 --> 01:26:38.280 align:start position:0%
for Pitman Robertson so we need to let
 
01:26:40.750 --> 01:26:40.760 align:start position:0%
the department charge right so but it's
 
01:26:43.709 --> 01:26:43.719 align:start position:0%
not won't quite be the same because
 
01:26:45.590 --> 01:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
you're only getting money for one tag
 
01:26:47.470 --> 01:26:47.480 align:start position:0%
unless you make it's true but the
 
01:26:50.070 --> 01:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
department does that um just basically
 
01:26:52.189 --> 01:26:52.199 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they are able to find
 
01:26:54.189 --> 01:26:54.199 align:start position:0%
fund things that have to do with that
 
01:26:56.189 --> 01:26:56.199 align:start position:0%
particular I get that but it's not quite

can open my business that's just like
 
03:18:27.630 --> 03:18:27.640 align:start position:0%
yours that's kind of like the same idea
 
03:18:27.640 --> 03:18:30.750 align:start position:0%
yours that's kind of like the same idea
I

03:18:30.750 --> 03:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:33.790 --> 03:18:33.800 align:start position:0%
think any applicant unsuccessful in
 
03:18:36.269 --> 03:18:36.279 align:start position:0%
passing the written exam may be allowed
 
03:18:39.670 --> 03:18:39.680 align:start position:0%
to retest at the next available date
 
03:18:42.189 --> 03:18:42.199 align:start position:0%
scheduled by the department but in no
 
03:18:45.070 --> 03:18:45.080 align:start position:0%
event sooner than 60 days from the date
 
03:18:46.870 --> 03:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
of the original
 
03:18:49.750 --> 03:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
examination 2 months seems a bit too
 
03:18:52.990 --> 03:18:53.000 align:start position:0%
long to retake an exam hunting and
 
03:18:54.870 --> 03:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
fishing are
 
03:18:57.269 --> 03:18:57.279 align:start position:0%
seasonal we're asking them to wait
 
03:19:00.510 --> 03:19:00.520 align:start position:0%
longer than necessary in my opinion hb1
 
03:19:04.189 --> 03:19:04.199 align:start position:0%
1228 recommends no less than two weeks
 
03:19:08.870 --> 03:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
according to FIS 130 01 applications and
 
03:19:11.269 --> 03:19:11.279 align:start position:0%
procedures the application of a person
 
03:19:13.429 --> 03:19:13.439 align:start position:0%
failing a second written or oral
 
03:19:15.790 --> 03:19:15.800 align:start position:0%

03:19:17.950 --> 03:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
writing subject to the right of the
 
03:19:20.469 --> 03:19:20.479 align:start position:0%
applicant to seek an appeal of the
 
03:19:22.870 --> 03:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
decision why should applicants have
 
03:19:26.910 --> 03:19:26.920 align:start position:0%
limited attempts lastly the current
 
03:19:29.189 --> 03:19:29.199 align:start position:0%
requirement that no person who has
 
03:19:31.750 --> 03:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
failed a second written or oral
 
03:19:33.910 --> 03:19:33.920 align:start position:0%

03:19:35.870 --> 03:19:35.880 align:start position:0%

03:19:38.870 --> 03:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
period of 1 year from the date of the
 
03:19:40.269 --> 03:19:40.279 align:start position:0%
second failed
 
03:19:44.030 --> 03:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
examination why so long a whole year
 
03:19:46.710 --> 03:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
perhaps a month would suffice hunting
 
03:19:49.630 --> 03:19:49.640 align:start position:0%
and fishing are limited to Seasons a
 
03:19:51.469 --> 03:19:51.479 align:start position:0%
year and holding an applicant from
 
03:19:53.950 --> 03:19:53.960 align:start position:0%
preceding these requirements just seems
 
03:19:56.389 --> 03:19:56.399 align:start position:0%
like a method to keep potential guides
 
03:19:58.070 --> 03:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
from being licensed within the same
 
03:20:00.110 --> 03:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
districts as current guides that are
 
03:20:01.429 --> 03:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
providing the
 
03:20:04.790 --> 03:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
examinations hb1 1228 also speaks to the
 
03:20:09.429 --> 03:20:09.439 align:start position:0%
license renewal requirement in RSA TW uh
 
03:20:12.030 --> 03:20:12.040 align:start position:0%
25.4 that currently states that every
 
03:20:14.870 --> 03:20:14.880 align:start position:0%

03:20:16.830 --> 03:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
has been a license guide in the state
 
03:20:19.070 --> 03:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
for five or more years May obtain a

accommodations and why does the
 
03:20:36.110 --> 03:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
executive director get to determine the

that
 
03:20:42.189 --> 03:20:42.199 align:start position:0%

rigorous requirements for applicants to

five person committee to steer the

03:21:54.309 --> 03:21:54.319 align:start position:0%
burden on one individual currently the
 
03:21:57.189 --> 03:21:57.199 align:start position:0%
executive director by having a committee

order to achieve a successful grade on
 
03:22:18.110 --> 03:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
the written and oral exams the Amendment

20241 77h states that members of this
 
03:22:24.070 --> 03:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
committee shall not currently or have
 
03:22:26.550 --> 03:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
formerly been guides this is to
 
03:22:28.950 --> 03:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
eliminate any possible Notions of
 
03:22:31.550 --> 03:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
biasness that is currently reflected on
 
03:22:35.110 --> 03:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
today's applicants by this process I ask
 
03:22:38.550 --> 03:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
that you support and accept Amendment
 
03:22:38.560 --> 03:22:40.750 align:start position:0%

d177
 
03:22:45.590 --> 03:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
and pass HB 1228 with Amendment so we
 
03:22:47.510 --> 03:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
can expand the fishing games guides
 
03:22:49.990 --> 03:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
program with a more fair and transparent
 
03:22:52.389 --> 03:22:52.399 align:start position:0%

committee have questions representative
 
03:23:27.229 --> 03:23:27.239 align:start position:0%
Harvey thank you Mr chair and uh thank
 
03:23:31.150 --> 03:23:31.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so um I
 
03:23:33.229 --> 03:23:33.239 align:start position:0%
I've I've not hired a guide but my
 
03:23:36.469 --> 03:23:36.479 align:start position:0%
husband has hired many guides and
 
03:23:38.750 --> 03:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
oftentimes he ends up with these guides
 
03:23:43.790 --> 03:23:43.800 align:start position:0%
in very um remote areas is so I'm
 
03:23:46.469 --> 03:23:46.479 align:start position:0%
wondering why you wouldn't
 
03:23:49.389 --> 03:23:49.399 align:start position:0%
support um a rigorous
 
03:23:49.399 --> 03:23:51.590 align:start position:0%
support um a rigorous
um

03:23:51.590 --> 03:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:57.229 --> 03:23:57.239 align:start position:0%
um a rigorous um outline of studies if
 
03:24:00.389 --> 03:24:00.399 align:start position:0%
indeed these guides are taking people
 
03:24:04.349 --> 03:24:04.359 align:start position:0%
and their lives at risk into very um you
 
03:24:07.309 --> 03:24:07.319 align:start position:0%
know Outback type country um I I heard
 
03:24:09.510 --> 03:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
your testimony about other states but
 
03:24:11.110 --> 03:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
that makes me just a little nervous I'm
 
03:24:13.590 --> 03:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
just if you could expand on that please
 
03:24:17.269 --> 03:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
sure no I am um not opposed to rigorous
 
03:24:19.429 --> 03:24:19.439 align:start position:0%
uh requirements as a matter of fact I
 
03:24:21.469 --> 03:24:21.479 align:start position:0%
think that everyone should be certified
 
03:24:25.269 --> 03:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
as a CPR and first aid um individual uh
 
03:24:28.110 --> 03:24:28.120 align:start position:0%
just having knowledge to me in in those
 
03:24:30.630 --> 03:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
far outreaches to me wouldn't be
 
03:24:33.510 --> 03:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
acceptable but it is only knowledgeable
 
03:24:36.269 --> 03:24:36.279 align:start position:0%
and that's why I really stress that um
 
03:24:39.429 --> 03:24:39.439 align:start position:0%
so I'm not opposed to that I I
 
03:24:42.229 --> 03:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
shared um other
 
03:24:46.550 --> 03:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
local or nearby States their testing
 
03:24:48.550 --> 03:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
procedures or what those qualifications
 
03:24:50.750 --> 03:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
are in comparison to what New Hampshire
 
03:24:54.750 --> 03:24:54.760 align:start position:0%
has because um information as to what is
 
03:24:58.269 --> 03:24:58.279 align:start position:0%
expected for a guide is provided more so
 
03:25:00.910 --> 03:25:00.920 align:start position:0%
than just a list of books and uh
 
03:25:02.990 --> 03:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
materials that a guide needs to find on
 
03:25:03.000 --> 03:25:07.590 align:start position:0%
materials that a guide needs to find on
their

03:25:07.590 --> 03:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:10.469 --> 03:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
own further
 
03:25:13.590 --> 03:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
03:25:17.070 --> 03:25:17.080 align:start position:0%
Paige thank you so if I if I understand
 
03:25:20.030 --> 03:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
your testimony correctly it sounds like
 
03:25:21.550 --> 03:25:21.560 align:start position:0%
either you are alleging or have you you
 
03:25:24.349 --> 03:25:24.359 align:start position:0%
have heard others allege that there is
 
03:25:28.150 --> 03:25:28.160 align:start position:0%
bias among the examiners my and also
 
03:25:30.389 --> 03:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
that they're not seeing the results of
 
03:25:31.389 --> 03:25:31.399 align:start position:0%
the oral
 
03:25:34.910 --> 03:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
examination are you aware of
 
03:25:37.030 --> 03:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
documentation of that oral examination
 
03:25:41.870 --> 03:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
that exists and are um to substantiate
 
03:25:44.590 --> 03:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
those allegations and are those publicly
 
03:25:46.750 --> 03:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
available after the examination upon
 
03:25:48.229 --> 03:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
request like through a right to no
 
03:25:49.910 --> 03:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
request or such thank you for your
 
03:25:51.990 --> 03:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
question um I'm not aware of any
 
03:25:54.510 --> 03:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
documentation especially on the oral
 
03:25:56.870 --> 03:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
examination because it is an oral
 
03:25:59.510 --> 03:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
question um however I do believe you'll

hear testimony from those who have
 
03:26:01.199 --> 03:26:04.150 align:start position:0%
hear testimony from those who have
experienced

03:26:04.150 --> 03:26:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:08.150 --> 03:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
that and vice chair goalie thank you Mr
 
03:26:10.389 --> 03:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking the
 
03:26:12.950 --> 03:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
question was I correct in hearing you
 
03:26:15.910 --> 03:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
say Maine does an oral interview I'm
 
03:26:18.269 --> 03:26:18.279 align:start position:0%
sorry can you repeat the
 
03:26:20.630 --> 03:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
question was I correct in hearing that
 
03:26:23.429 --> 03:26:23.439 align:start position:0%
you stated Maine does a written as well
 
03:26:27.070 --> 03:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
as oral correct
 
03:26:30.030 --> 03:26:30.040 align:start position:0%
follow follow
 
03:26:33.790 --> 03:26:33.800 align:start position:0%
up do you know if after the oral
 
03:26:36.110 --> 03:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
interview in Maine if they are provided
 
03:26:38.269 --> 03:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
if they fail a reason why through the
 
03:26:42.269 --> 03:26:42.279 align:start position:0%
oral interview I do not know that
 
03:26:45.070 --> 03:26:45.080 align:start position:0%
one last follow
 
03:26:48.910 --> 03:26:48.920 align:start position:0%
up so I guess my question is so main
 
03:26:51.750 --> 03:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
could be doing well it sounds good that
 
03:26:55.030 --> 03:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:57.830 --> 03:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
oral comparing them to New Hampshire
 
03:26:59.590 --> 03:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
saying they're better off by doing the
 
03:27:01.950 --> 03:27:01.960 align:start position:0%
process the way they do it really might
 
03:27:03.630 --> 03:27:03.640 align:start position:0%
not be the truth if they have a
 
03:27:05.469 --> 03:27:05.479 align:start position:0%
subjective oral interview same way New
 
03:27:05.479 --> 03:27:07.070 align:start position:0%
subjective oral interview same way New
Hampshire

03:27:07.070 --> 03:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:27:10.990 --> 03:27:11.000 align:start position:0%
does can I answer that kind of question
 
03:27:13.110 --> 03:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
um so I'm not saying that Maine is
 
03:27:15.550 --> 03:27:15.560 align:start position:0%
better I'm just kind of expressing what
 
03:27:18.630 --> 03:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
the other states are have been doing and
 
03:27:21.030 --> 03:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
and how they conduct their exams and
 
03:27:23.349 --> 03:27:23.359 align:start position:0%
their fee
 
03:27:26.610 --> 03:27:26.620 align:start position:0%
process thank you any further
 
03:27:26.620 --> 03:27:29.030 align:start position:0%
process thank you any further

03:27:29.030 --> 03:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:27:32.309 --> 03:27:32.319 align:start position:0%
questions representa Ford representative
 
03:27:34.429 --> 03:27:34.439 align:start position:0%
Ford thank you chairman thank you for
 
03:27:36.670 --> 03:27:36.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question just real quick on
 
03:27:39.389 --> 03:27:39.399 align:start position:0%
the amendment it says that the committee
 
03:27:42.070 --> 03:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh the fish Game Commission
 
03:27:45.510 --> 03:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
the guide committee should be only of
 
03:27:48.030 --> 03:27:48.040 align:start position:0%
active or retired conservation officers
 
03:27:49.950 --> 03:27:49.960 align:start position:0%
and I I'm just wondering would you be
 
03:27:53.070 --> 03:27:53.080 align:start position:0%
open to having someone from like uh the
 
03:27:55.830 --> 03:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire guides Association on this
 
03:27:58.630 --> 03:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
particular um committee and not just
 
03:28:01.229 --> 03:28:01.239 align:start position:0%
conservation officers recognizing they
 
03:28:03.429 --> 03:28:03.439 align:start position:0%
are guides and they may not be in the
 
03:28:05.189 --> 03:28:05.199 align:start position:0%
same business I love your analogy I
 
03:28:07.630 --> 03:28:07.640 align:start position:0%
really appreciate it um but they would
 
03:28:09.309 --> 03:28:09.319 align:start position:0%
understand what it means to become a
 
03:28:11.469 --> 03:28:11.479 align:start position:0%
guide and could give insights that maybe
 
03:28:13.309 --> 03:28:13.319 align:start position:0%
a conservation officer may not
 
03:28:15.750 --> 03:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily have would you be open to
 
03:28:18.429 --> 03:28:18.439 align:start position:0%
adding those with experience as a guide
 
03:28:20.910 --> 03:28:20.920 align:start position:0%
on this particular committee um so the
 
03:28:22.750 --> 03:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
amendment does specifically State on
 
03:28:24.349 --> 03:28:24.359 align:start position:0%
line seven the members of the committee
 
03:28:26.590 --> 03:28:26.600 align:start position:0%
shall not currently be or have forly
 
03:28:28.790 --> 03:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
been guides that's the purpose of this
 
03:28:30.990 --> 03:28:31.000 align:start position:0%
amendment unfortunately was in the
 
03:28:33.309 --> 03:28:33.319 align:start position:0%
original bill and I wanted to make sure
 
03:28:36.309 --> 03:28:36.319 align:start position:0%
that that was clear my understanding is
 
03:28:38.830 --> 03:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
that um it would be preferred not
 
03:28:40.950 --> 03:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps they could be advisory but not
 
03:28:44.070 --> 03:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:47.229 --> 03:28:47.239 align:start position:0%
Committees follow up and from your point
 
03:28:49.349 --> 03:28:49.359 align:start position:0%
of view what is the what's the benefit
 
03:28:51.309 --> 03:28:51.319 align:start position:0%
or the loss both actually what's the
 
03:28:53.070 --> 03:28:53.080 align:start position:0%
benefit and what's the loss of not
 
03:28:55.269 --> 03:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
having someone who is a former or
 
03:28:58.309 --> 03:28:58.319 align:start position:0%
current guide on the on the commission
 
03:29:01.670 --> 03:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
or on the committee sorry so I am not um
 
03:29:03.950 --> 03:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
a hunter or Fisher but I do support them
 
03:29:07.150 --> 03:29:07.160 align:start position:0%
I have family members that are um and I
 
03:29:09.910 --> 03:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
understand where um they are in this
 
03:29:12.189 --> 03:29:12.199 align:start position:0%
position it's a tight community
 
03:29:14.189 --> 03:29:14.199 align:start position:0%
and I think that
 
03:29:16.590 --> 03:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
um there tends to
 
03:29:18.950 --> 03:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
be maybe
 
03:29:21.510 --> 03:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding and just to avoid that
 
03:29:25.910 --> 03:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
kind of um misunderstanding or
 
03:29:28.070 --> 03:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
biasness um it would be better for the
 
03:29:30.750 --> 03:29:30.760 align:start position:0%
committee not to have a representative
 
03:29:35.870 --> 03:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:38.910 --> 03:29:38.920 align:start position:0%
Association representative
 
03:29:41.070 --> 03:29:41.080 align:start position:0%
Morton thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:29:44.030 --> 03:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
03:29:46.469 --> 03:29:46.479 align:start position:0%
um the amendment does state that you'd
 
03:29:47.870 --> 03:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
like the committee to be comprised only
 
03:29:49.830 --> 03:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
of active and retire or retired
 
03:29:51.590 --> 03:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
conservation officers from Fish and Game
 
03:29:53.630 --> 03:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
law enforcement division as the members
 
03:29:55.950 --> 03:29:55.960 align:start position:0%
did you consult with fish and game about
 
03:29:57.670 --> 03:29:57.680 align:start position:0%
that and do they feel like they have
 
03:30:00.189 --> 03:30:00.199 align:start position:0%
enough active and retired members who
 
03:30:03.650 --> 03:30:03.660 align:start position:0%
have time to be on this committee I have
 
03:30:03.660 --> 03:30:06.269 align:start position:0%
have time to be on this committee I have
[Music]

03:30:06.269 --> 03:30:06.279 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:30:09.269 --> 03:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
not any further
 
03:30:12.630 --> 03:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative goalie Vice
 
03:30:14.950 --> 03:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
chair goalie thank you Mr chair and just
 
03:30:17.269 --> 03:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
one last question on the
 
03:30:20.670 --> 03:30:20.680 align:start position:0%
amendment do you know if any of the
 
03:30:23.269 --> 03:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
other states you cited in their testing
 
03:30:25.950 --> 03:30:25.960 align:start position:0%
process have requirements that no member
 
03:30:29.950 --> 03:30:29.960 align:start position:0%
of their c um testing Community
 
03:30:32.670 --> 03:30:32.680 align:start position:0%
is any guide cannot participate in this
 
03:30:34.710 --> 03:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
process I'm not familiar with their
 
03:30:37.269 --> 03:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
process as far as a committee or who is
 
03:30:41.110 --> 03:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
in um direct contact with providing that
 
03:30:41.120 --> 03:30:41.910 align:start position:0%
in um direct contact with providing that
those

03:30:41.910 --> 03:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
those
 
03:30:44.429 --> 03:30:44.439 align:start position:0%
resources um it's
 
03:30:46.910 --> 03:30:46.920 align:start position:0%
just I think this might be a suitable
 
03:30:50.510 --> 03:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
process to alleviate any um supposed
 
03:30:52.990 --> 03:30:53.000 align:start position:0%
bias and have more transparency and
 
03:30:57.309 --> 03:30:57.319 align:start position:0%
oversight and a um a committee
 
03:31:00.870 --> 03:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
where um applicants can come to a
 
03:31:02.990 --> 03:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
meeting to address certain situations
 
03:31:05.349 --> 03:31:05.359 align:start position:0%
that may
 
03:31:09.110 --> 03:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
occur thank you any further
 
03:31:11.670 --> 03:31:11.680 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
03:31:14.309 --> 03:31:14.319 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony today thank
 
03:31:16.830 --> 03:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
you the chair will recognize now
 
03:31:19.550 --> 03:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
representative Glenn Bailey who's asked
 
03:31:26.269 --> 03:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:28.630 --> 03:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
minutes yeah I actually had her next
 
03:31:30.229 --> 03:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
anyway so if you'd like to switch places
 
03:31:32.750 --> 03:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
we can do that representative Penza
 
03:31:39.630 --> 03:31:39.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:42.150 --> 03:31:42.160 align:start position:0%
minutes so I was made aware of this
 
03:31:44.590 --> 03:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
issue from uh representative Claudine
 
03:31:47.309 --> 03:31:47.319 align:start position:0%
Burnham and then uh spoke with a few
 
03:31:49.990 --> 03:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
members in my county in straford county
 
03:31:52.830 --> 03:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
that this is affected so I think we're
 
03:31:54.750 --> 03:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
reading into this bill a lot this
 
03:31:56.910 --> 03:31:56.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't change the requirements the
 
03:31:59.189 --> 03:31:59.199 align:start position:0%
rigorous standards or anything like that
 
03:32:01.870 --> 03:32:01.880 align:start position:0%
I think full transparency is important
 
03:32:03.950 --> 03:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
telling people you know they don't the
 
03:32:06.830 --> 03:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
other states by the way do have um they
 
03:32:08.670 --> 03:32:08.680 align:start position:0%
do provide study materials and things
 
03:32:10.469 --> 03:32:10.479 align:start position:0%
like that that we don't so we're giving
 
03:32:12.830 --> 03:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
them a list and we're asking them to
 
03:32:15.590 --> 03:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
just go out and get those things um when
 
03:32:17.830 --> 03:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
you fail a test if you don't have any
 
03:32:20.070 --> 03:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
idea how you failed it that's just
 
03:32:24.030 --> 03:32:24.040 align:start position:0%
ridiculous so that fixes this um there's
 
03:32:26.870 --> 03:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
one person right now that is that is in
 
03:32:29.750 --> 03:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
charge of this and so having a committee
 
03:32:32.630 --> 03:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
um it's so we have and the transparency
 
03:32:34.870 --> 03:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
of it is if you have someone that's in
 
03:32:36.990 --> 03:32:37.000 align:start position:0%
the gues business it is a very small
 
03:32:39.349 --> 03:32:39.359 align:start position:0%
community you have to be very careful
 
03:32:41.510 --> 03:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
about you know they're going of course
 
03:32:42.510 --> 03:32:42.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to want to pick the
 
03:32:44.150 --> 03:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
winners and the losers too because they
 
03:32:45.950 --> 03:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
don't want to have necessarily that
 
03:32:48.070 --> 03:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
competition so I think this levels the
 
03:32:51.229 --> 03:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
playing field it offers transparency and
 
03:32:52.990 --> 03:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
I think that's just what's needed
 
03:32:55.309 --> 03:32:55.319 align:start position:0%
because there's one person right now
 
03:32:58.070 --> 03:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
that is making these decisions so mind
 
03:33:00.189 --> 03:33:00.199 align:start position:0%
you this wasn't we didn't want to have
 
03:33:03.710 --> 03:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
to P put a bill in uh we tried to fix
 
03:33:06.150 --> 03:33:06.160 align:start position:0%
this another way and we didn't get
 
03:33:08.870 --> 03:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
anywhere and so that is why this bill is
 
03:33:11.710 --> 03:33:11.720 align:start position:0%
forward so and I have to go testify on
 
03:33:14.110 --> 03:33:14.120 align:start position:0%
another bill but uh if you have any
 
03:33:16.590 --> 03:33:16.600 align:start position:0%
questions um you know I can take a
 
03:33:19.469 --> 03:33:19.479 align:start position:0%
couple but this is this is really just
 
03:33:21.990 --> 03:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
fixing a fixing a problem and a little
 
03:33:23.790 --> 03:33:23.800 align:start position:0%
bit of an injustice to some people that
 
03:33:26.550 --> 03:33:26.560 align:start position:0%
have been really trying to um to get
 
03:33:26.560 --> 03:33:27.910 align:start position:0%
have been really trying to um to get
this

03:33:27.910 --> 03:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:33:30.950 --> 03:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
license any questions representative
 
03:33:34.950 --> 03:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
Harvey so um I I hear what you're saying
 
03:33:37.309 --> 03:33:37.319 align:start position:0%
basically what they're pres providing is
 
03:33:41.110 --> 03:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
a syllabus a list of um material where
 
03:33:43.189 --> 03:33:43.199 align:start position:0%
the questions might come from but not a
 
03:33:45.830 --> 03:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
list of the questions and you know
 
03:33:48.229 --> 03:33:48.239 align:start position:0%
that's all of us have gone through high
 
03:33:50.870 --> 03:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
school and and Beyond and and that's
 
03:33:52.870 --> 03:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
kind of what you get as a syllabus why
 
03:33:54.830 --> 03:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
is why are you suggesting it should be
 
03:33:57.030 --> 03:33:57.040 align:start position:0%
different than for an organization that
 
03:34:00.550 --> 03:34:00.560 align:start position:0%
takes people's lives into their hands I
 
03:34:02.910 --> 03:34:02.920 align:start position:0%
didn't suggest that at all I I suggested
 
03:34:04.469 --> 03:34:04.479 align:start position:0%
a study guide doesn't give the answers
 
03:34:07.590 --> 03:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
to the questions so she gave you the
 
03:34:09.269 --> 03:34:09.279 align:start position:0%
laundry list of everything that you
 
03:34:11.590 --> 03:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
would need to know specifically if you
 
03:34:14.110 --> 03:34:14.120 align:start position:0%
are going to uh get this licensing and I
 
03:34:17.110 --> 03:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
think that's fine but uh you know an
 
03:34:19.790 --> 03:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
outline would be nice I'm not asking for
 
03:34:28.150 --> 03:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:30.670 --> 03:34:30.680 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
03:34:32.870 --> 03:34:32.880 align:start position:0%
Darby thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
03:34:34.870 --> 03:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question you said that um
 
03:34:37.590 --> 03:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
you've I talked to some people that were
 
03:34:40.349 --> 03:34:40.359 align:start position:0%
um you know grieved by the existing
 
03:34:43.750 --> 03:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
process say which um which kind of what
 
03:34:46.030 --> 03:34:46.040 align:start position:0%
type of guides were they freshwater
 
03:34:48.870 --> 03:34:48.880 align:start position:0%
hunting saltwater they're here so
 
03:34:50.750 --> 03:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to I want them to speak to
 
03:34:56.710 --> 03:34:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:59.710 --> 03:34:59.720 align:start position:0%
thanks representative Smith thank you Mr
 
03:35:01.110 --> 03:35:01.120 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
03:35:03.830 --> 03:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
question can you just clarify you said
 
03:35:06.070 --> 03:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
there's only one person in charge of it
 
03:35:08.150 --> 03:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
now is that referring to the oral board
 
03:35:10.670 --> 03:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
decision no that's referring to the
 
03:35:13.550 --> 03:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
executive director okay thank you that's
 
03:35:17.110 --> 03:35:17.120 align:start position:0%
all any other questions seeing none
 
03:35:18.309 --> 03:35:18.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and good
 
03:35:22.229 --> 03:35:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:24.550 --> 03:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
bill the chair now recognizes
 
03:35:31.150 --> 03:35:31.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:33.349 --> 03:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
Bailey thank you Mr chairman and
 
03:35:36.309 --> 03:35:36.319 align:start position:0%
esteemed committee members uh I know
 
03:35:38.630 --> 03:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
nothing about fishing game um I I've
 
03:35:40.590 --> 03:35:40.600 align:start position:0%
heard some of the same complaints and
 
03:35:43.630 --> 03:35:43.640 align:start position:0%
and I would I guess my expertise you
 
03:35:45.030 --> 03:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
call it that is I've spent three years
 
03:35:47.830 --> 03:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
on Edna representative goalie can verify
 
03:35:50.110 --> 03:35:50.120 align:start position:0%
that and we seem to spend a considerable
 
03:35:52.630 --> 03:35:52.640 align:start position:0%
amount of time with boards and licenses
 
03:35:55.309 --> 03:35:55.319 align:start position:0%
and there's been a trend over the last
 
03:35:57.469 --> 03:35:57.479 align:start position:0%
couple of years of separating the board
 
03:35:58.349 --> 03:35:58.359 align:start position:0%
from the
 
03:36:00.990 --> 03:36:01.000 align:start position:0%
licensing well the board provides the
 
03:36:03.590 --> 03:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
knowledge of what should be known and
 
03:36:05.790 --> 03:36:05.800 align:start position:0%
what should be tested and the licensing
 
03:36:06.910 --> 03:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
is done by
 
03:36:10.990 --> 03:36:11.000 align:start position:0%
oplc and he can confirm that for me but
 
03:36:12.630 --> 03:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
we were warned at one point about there
 
03:36:15.349 --> 03:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
was a particular license that only had
 
03:36:18.030 --> 03:36:18.040 align:start position:0%
30 people in the whole state had the
 
03:36:21.429 --> 03:36:21.439 align:start position:0%
license and there was seven of them were
 
03:36:24.750 --> 03:36:24.760 align:start position:0%
on the board you know and in in a
 
03:36:26.670 --> 03:36:26.680 align:start position:0%
rotation it's like well the same 30
 
03:36:28.189 --> 03:36:28.199 align:start position:0%
people rotate through the board every
 
03:36:30.750 --> 03:36:30.760 align:start position:0%
three or four years you know it gets to
 
03:36:33.389 --> 03:36:33.399 align:start position:0%
be a little incestuous you might say and
 
03:36:34.790 --> 03:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
they were warned that they were in
 
03:36:35.870 --> 03:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
danger of a
 
03:36:39.590 --> 03:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
lawsuit that it was so closed and so
 
03:36:41.510 --> 03:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
particular to
 
03:36:43.510 --> 03:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
the choice of those people as to who
 
03:36:46.870 --> 03:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
would be next to be on this license they
 
03:36:48.030 --> 03:36:48.040 align:start position:0%
were just warned that there was a
 
03:36:50.710 --> 03:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
potential there for a serious lawsuit
 
03:36:52.830 --> 03:36:52.840 align:start position:0%
and I kind of wonder if maybe some of
 
03:36:54.670 --> 03:36:54.680 align:start position:0%
that is rearing its head here from what
 
03:36:57.070 --> 03:36:57.080 align:start position:0%
I heard from some people who were
 
03:36:58.429 --> 03:36:58.439 align:start position:0%
attempting to get
 
03:37:01.990 --> 03:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
licensed is it gets to be so it's an
 
03:37:03.710 --> 03:37:03.720 align:start position:0%
oral exam and they won't tell you what
 
03:37:05.189 --> 03:37:05.199 align:start position:0%
you did wrong and then you have to take
 
03:37:07.110 --> 03:37:07.120 align:start position:0%
it again and they won't tell you what
 
03:37:09.229 --> 03:37:09.239 align:start position:0%
you did wrong so you do it wrong again
 
03:37:11.990 --> 03:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
it gets to be a little
 
03:37:14.510 --> 03:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
hinky uh that's all I just I would
 
03:37:16.630 --> 03:37:16.640 align:start position:0%
advise you to take a look at that aspect
 
03:37:18.510 --> 03:37:18.520 align:start position:0%
and maybe consider separating them like
 
03:37:21.550 --> 03:37:21.560 align:start position:0%
every other license in the state is
 
03:37:24.030 --> 03:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
trending thank you thank you for your
 
03:37:26.189 --> 03:37:26.199 align:start position:0%
testimony are you open to questions
 
03:37:30.070 --> 03:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:33.189 --> 03:37:33.199 align:start position:0%
questions representative peir thank you
 
03:37:35.030 --> 03:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thanks for taking my question
 
03:37:38.189 --> 03:37:38.199 align:start position:0%
just to be clear you talked about a some
 
03:37:41.710 --> 03:37:41.720 align:start position:0%
board that was uh admonished that they
 
03:37:44.830 --> 03:37:44.840 align:start position:0%
were expecting a lawsuit that is not not
 
03:37:46.309 --> 03:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
anything wait a minute that's not
 
03:37:48.710 --> 03:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
anything relative to fish and game oh no
 
03:37:50.950 --> 03:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
it wasn't fishing it was just it's just
 
03:37:52.870 --> 03:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
the style of Licensing you know there's
 
03:37:56.110 --> 03:37:56.120 align:start position:0%
a there's a trend to to be a certain way
 
03:37:58.110 --> 03:37:58.120 align:start position:0%
the board is one thing and the knowledge
 
03:38:00.910 --> 03:38:00.920 align:start position:0%
is one thing this began to sound I don't
 
03:38:02.630 --> 03:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
think brain surgeons have it as
 
03:38:04.469 --> 03:38:04.479 align:start position:0%
difficult as fishing game
 
03:38:04.479 --> 03:38:07.389 align:start position:0%
difficult as fishing game
gues

03:38:07.389 --> 03:38:07.399 align:start position:0%
gues
 
03:38:09.910 --> 03:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh you might want to consider whether
 
03:38:12.790 --> 03:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:15.990 --> 03:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
much thank you again for your testimony
 
03:38:18.070 --> 03:38:18.080 align:start position:0%

questions seeing none thank
 
03:38:24.510 --> 03:38:24.520 align:start position:0%

appreciate you passing that out and
 
03:38:46.790 --> 03:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:48.750 --> 03:38:48.760 align:start position:0%

03:38:51.269 --> 03:38:51.279 align:start position:0%
front of us thank you thanks my name is
 
03:38:53.510 --> 03:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
David P I am here representing the the
 
03:38:56.269 --> 03:38:56.279 align:start position:0%
hon guides Association and for those of
 
03:38:58.830 --> 03:38:58.840 align:start position:0%
you that read that written testimony I
 
03:39:02.469 --> 03:39:02.479 align:start position:0%
am principally since Co the guides
 
03:39:05.429 --> 03:39:05.439 align:start position:0%
Association representative to the uh to
 
03:39:05.439 --> 03:39:07.070 align:start position:0%
Association representative to the uh to
the

03:39:07.070 --> 03:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:39:09.950 --> 03:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
uh board that does the the group that
 
03:39:09.960 --> 03:39:10.990 align:start position:0%
uh board that does the the group that
does

03:39:10.990 --> 03:39:11.000 align:start position:0%
does
 
03:39:14.070 --> 03:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
evaluation so if you would believe all
 
03:39:16.110 --> 03:39:16.120 align:start position:0%
of this I'm the person that's trying to
 
03:39:18.070 --> 03:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
stop other guides from being
 
03:39:21.630 --> 03:39:21.640 align:start position:0%
guides um if you read the testimony that
 
03:39:27.030 --> 03:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
that that I gave that's incorrect um and
 
03:39:30.710 --> 03:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
I and the other the I can't say it vly
 
03:39:31.790 --> 03:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
enough but I'm not going to repeat
 
03:39:35.070 --> 03:39:35.080 align:start position:0%
myself that is not the intent um what I
 
03:39:36.870 --> 03:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
would bring to the uh to the committee's
 
03:39:39.870 --> 03:39:39.880 align:start position:0%
attention is that um the board of
 
03:39:39.880 --> 03:39:40.950 align:start position:0%
attention is that um the board of
electric

03:39:40.950 --> 03:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
electric
 
03:39:45.469 --> 03:39:45.479 align:start position:0%
rans is I'm Car electrical licensed so I
 
03:39:47.750 --> 03:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
have a little bit of background this one
 
03:39:49.189 --> 03:39:49.199 align:start position:0%
um the board of electricians is three
 
03:39:50.870 --> 03:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
licensed electricians two from the
 
03:39:52.389 --> 03:39:52.399 align:start position:0%
public and the fire and a representative
 
03:39:54.429 --> 03:39:54.439 align:start position:0%
of the fire Marshall's office every time
 
03:39:56.710 --> 03:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
you take the test the application fee is
 
03:40:01.429 --> 03:40:01.439 align:start position:0%
$60 the exam is $50 and a r test is
 
03:40:01.439 --> 03:40:03.429 align:start position:0%
$60 the exam is $50 and a r test is
$25

03:40:03.429 --> 03:40:03.439 align:start position:0%
$25
 
03:40:07.990 --> 03:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
so electricians testing electricians or
 
03:40:09.790 --> 03:40:09.800 align:start position:0%
certainly providing the information for
 
03:40:09.800 --> 03:40:11.150 align:start position:0%
certainly providing the information for
that

03:40:11.150 --> 03:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:40:16.269 --> 03:40:16.279 align:start position:0%
um main Wildlife it's I don't want to
 
03:40:19.510 --> 03:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
Discount the uh sponsor testimony but
 
03:40:21.229 --> 03:40:21.239 align:start position:0%
it's not $100 it's
 
03:40:22.990 --> 03:40:23.000 align:start position:0%
$125 and it's
 
03:40:26.229 --> 03:40:26.239 align:start position:0%
$125 for each classification so if you
 
03:40:28.910 --> 03:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
apply for Hunting Fishing those are all
 
03:40:30.870 --> 03:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
$125 every
 
03:40:34.150 --> 03:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
time every time you retake the failed
 
03:40:37.030 --> 03:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
oral exam it's
 
03:40:40.870 --> 03:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
$125 their their committee
 
03:40:43.790 --> 03:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
their evaluators are made out of are
 
03:40:44.750 --> 03:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
made up
 
03:40:44.760 --> 03:40:46.630 align:start position:0%
made up
of

03:40:46.630 --> 03:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:40:48.950 --> 03:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
wardens members of of the guide
 
03:40:51.189 --> 03:40:51.199 align:start position:0%
community and members of what would be
 
03:40:53.429 --> 03:40:53.439 align:start position:0%
fishing game here it's uh DMR I believe
 
03:40:58.110 --> 03:40:58.120 align:start position:0%
in Maine so they have a very similar
 
03:41:00.510 --> 03:41:00.520 align:start position:0%
setup as to what we
 
03:41:03.550 --> 03:41:03.560 align:start position:0%
have the issue that so I have been as in
 
03:41:05.550 --> 03:41:05.560 align:start position:0%
that in that written testimony I've been
 
03:41:08.429 --> 03:41:08.439 align:start position:0%
involved in this since the since we I've
 
03:41:10.630 --> 03:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
been a guide since 2005 drive from the
 
03:41:12.670 --> 03:41:12.680 align:start position:0%
fire service in 2007 and I've been
 
03:41:15.030 --> 03:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
involved in this process since that proc
 
03:41:17.469 --> 03:41:17.479 align:start position:0%
from from that point
 
03:41:17.479 --> 03:41:19.030 align:start position:0%
from from that point
onward

03:41:19.030 --> 03:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
onward
 
03:41:21.910 --> 03:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
originally uh and and to dat there is no
 
03:41:25.030 --> 03:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
cost to taking a test the guides test in
 
03:41:27.550 --> 03:41:27.560 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire what that has
 
03:41:29.910 --> 03:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
evolved into is people don't have any
 
03:41:33.910 --> 03:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
skin in the game so and and I will say
 
03:41:36.550 --> 03:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
as a matter of background there are not
 
03:41:39.830 --> 03:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
30 there's anywhere between 150 and 200
 
03:41:41.070 --> 03:41:41.080 align:start position:0%
Li license guides in state of New
 
03:41:43.189 --> 03:41:43.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire depending on what year it is
 
03:41:47.389 --> 03:41:47.399 align:start position:0%
and what time of year it is um and of
 
03:41:49.790 --> 03:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
that there are probably I can count less
 
03:41:52.269 --> 03:41:52.279 align:start position:0%
than 20 that make their living at
 
03:41:55.229 --> 03:41:55.239 align:start position:0%
guiding and I put myself in the the rest
 
03:41:57.189 --> 03:41:57.199 align:start position:0%
are it's a hobby
 
03:41:59.950 --> 03:41:59.960 align:start position:0%
we found something we love to do and we
 
03:42:03.429 --> 03:42:03.439 align:start position:0%
do it um but it is not our primary way
 
03:42:07.429 --> 03:42:07.439 align:start position:0%
of making a living so given that fact
 
03:42:10.030 --> 03:42:10.040 align:start position:0%
that people come to this test and I will
 
03:42:11.670 --> 03:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
tell you from a lot of years of being an
 
03:42:15.149 --> 03:42:15.159 align:start position:0%
evaluator they come to this test totally
 
03:42:18.309 --> 03:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
totally unprepared and that has resulted
 
03:42:22.590 --> 03:42:22.600 align:start position:0%
in a a tremendous amount of folks that
 
03:42:26.189 --> 03:42:26.199 align:start position:0%
just don't get past the first Iota now
 
03:42:28.830 --> 03:42:28.840 align:start position:0%
for those of you that took Hunter Ed you
 
03:42:31.630 --> 03:42:31.640 align:start position:0%
spent 30 minutes learning how to orient
 
03:42:35.950 --> 03:42:35.960 align:start position:0%
a map and find North
 
03:42:38.950 --> 03:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
right that is one of the
 
03:42:41.429 --> 03:42:41.439 align:start position:0%
questions and I can't tell you
 
03:42:43.070 --> 03:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
accurately but I can tell you that of
 
03:42:47.229 --> 03:42:47.239 align:start position:0%
the last group three of them
 
03:42:49.229 --> 03:42:49.239 align:start position:0%
failed now if you're going to go out in
 
03:42:51.070 --> 03:42:51.080 align:start position:0%
the woods with somebody wouldn't you
 
03:42:53.189 --> 03:42:53.199 align:start position:0%
want them to be able to orient a map and
 
03:42:55.309 --> 03:42:55.319 align:start position:0%
use a magnetic
 
03:42:58.070 --> 03:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
compass so that those are the kinds of
 
03:43:01.870 --> 03:43:01.880 align:start position:0%
things that that I find um being issues
 
03:43:04.670 --> 03:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
so not having that investment and not
 
03:43:07.429 --> 03:43:07.439 align:start position:0%
having a
 
03:43:09.990 --> 03:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
a financial impact when I took my
 
03:43:12.750 --> 03:43:12.760 align:start position:0%
electrician's Li license test that I was
 
03:43:13.630 --> 03:43:13.640 align:start position:0%
going to make a living that's how I was
 
03:43:16.389 --> 03:43:16.399 align:start position:0%
going to feed my family guiding is not
 
03:43:18.070 --> 03:43:18.080 align:start position:0%
who having ever intended to feed my
 
03:43:19.550 --> 03:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
family and some many thinks are going to
 
03:43:21.110 --> 03:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
guide for a living and and feed their
 
03:43:24.189 --> 03:43:24.199 align:start position:0%
family a lot is probably
 
03:43:28.429 --> 03:43:28.439 align:start position:0%
mistaken um and as far as the uh the
 
03:43:30.510 --> 03:43:30.520 align:start position:0%
oral exam I am not sure the colonel can
 
03:43:32.750 --> 03:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
certainly speak to whether it's uh
 
03:43:35.750 --> 03:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
discoverable uh through right to know um
 
03:43:37.469 --> 03:43:37.479 align:start position:0%
and it's a personal record I'm not sure
 
03:43:40.309 --> 03:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
how that would work if it is if if it is
 
03:43:42.830 --> 03:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
available uh you'll be surprised I will
 
03:43:44.510 --> 03:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
tell you that so again I came from the
 
03:43:47.830 --> 03:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
fire service side everything we do is
 
03:43:49.189 --> 03:43:49.199 align:start position:0%
based on an oral
 
03:43:49.199 --> 03:43:51.429 align:start position:0%
based on an oral
exam

03:43:51.429 --> 03:43:51.439 align:start position:0%
exam
 
03:43:54.229 --> 03:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
and those were very subjective oral
 
03:43:56.349 --> 03:43:56.359 align:start position:0%
exams if you made a mistake you could be
 
03:43:57.870 --> 03:43:57.880 align:start position:0%
taken down a bad
 
03:44:02.070 --> 03:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
Road this oral exam we fishing game
 
03:44:04.910 --> 03:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
chose early and we have maintained this
 
03:44:07.750 --> 03:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
is this is structured this is not a
 
03:44:10.429 --> 03:44:10.439 align:start position:0%
single question that you fail this is a
 
03:44:13.590 --> 03:44:13.600 align:start position:0%
series of questions that have assigned
 
03:44:16.950 --> 03:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
grades now the incident
 
03:44:20.269 --> 03:44:20.279 align:start position:0%
changes but the grades stay the same
 
03:44:22.990 --> 03:44:23.000 align:start position:0%
throughout so it is not an arbitrary
 
03:44:26.110 --> 03:44:26.120 align:start position:0%
Dave P decided I don't like your color
 
03:44:27.630 --> 03:44:27.640 align:start position:0%
your eyes you're going to become a
 
03:44:29.269 --> 03:44:29.279 align:start position:0%
fishing guide you're going to become I
 
03:44:30.830 --> 03:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
have to be a fly fishing
 
03:44:35.229 --> 03:44:35.239 align:start position:0%
guide somebody comes in we need guides
 
03:44:37.590 --> 03:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
we cannot we have never been in a
 
03:44:38.910 --> 03:44:38.920 align:start position:0%
position where we had enough guides in
 
03:44:40.080 --> 03:44:40.090 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
03:44:40.090 --> 03:44:41.670 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
[Music]

03:44:41.670 --> 03:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:44:44.550 --> 03:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
ever and with that I'll conclude my
 
03:44:47.429 --> 03:44:47.439 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you much if nobody
 
03:44:49.830 --> 03:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
objects I'm going to ask one question
 
03:44:53.269 --> 03:44:53.279 align:start position:0%
first uh you mentioned that there's no
 
03:44:56.070 --> 03:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
skin in the game would it be something
 
03:44:58.030 --> 03:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
that fish and game should consider in
 
03:45:00.309 --> 03:45:00.319 align:start position:0%
charging for the guides
 
03:45:04.309 --> 03:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
license in my humble opinion yes um and
 
03:45:08.469 --> 03:45:08.479 align:start position:0%
and so if I if I might be allowed to
 
03:45:11.950 --> 03:45:11.960 align:start position:0%
expand a little bit it's your floor uh
 
03:45:14.990 --> 03:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
so initially when I hope I'm not going
 
03:45:18.790 --> 03:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
to step over to you're doing fine um
 
03:45:20.030 --> 03:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
initially when this was started we were
 
03:45:21.830 --> 03:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
doing tests every every
 
03:45:25.429 --> 03:45:25.439 align:start position:0%
quarter uh so you had the opportunity to
 
03:45:27.469 --> 03:45:27.479 align:start position:0%
take the test every quarter I'm not sure
 
03:45:29.429 --> 03:45:29.439 align:start position:0%
so everything I tell you is about the is
 
03:45:32.790 --> 03:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
about the oral board I I have no
 
03:45:34.510 --> 03:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
involvement at all in the written
 
03:45:36.950 --> 03:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
portion of this okay when they come to
 
03:45:38.189 --> 03:45:38.199 align:start position:0%
when they come to the or board they
 
03:45:40.710 --> 03:45:40.720 align:start position:0%
passed the written so it was every
 
03:45:43.870 --> 03:45:43.880 align:start position:0%
quarter and what what happened was um
 
03:45:46.389 --> 03:45:46.399 align:start position:0%
because there was no cost people just
 
03:45:49.269 --> 03:45:49.279 align:start position:0%
showed up and and as a matter of fact I
 
03:45:53.510 --> 03:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
believe I'm fairly accurate 25%
 
03:45:56.110 --> 03:45:56.120 align:start position:0%
25% of the people don't show up for the
 
03:45:58.469 --> 03:45:58.479 align:start position:0%
test because they have no skin in the
 
03:46:02.750 --> 03:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
game so we show up myself at least one
 
03:46:06.510 --> 03:46:06.520 align:start position:0%
Co maybe two cosos and they don't show
 
03:46:11.429 --> 03:46:11.439 align:start position:0%
up for their exams so that's an
 
03:46:15.070 --> 03:46:15.080 align:start position:0%
issue I'll lost my train sorry it's fine
 
03:46:17.030 --> 03:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
any further questions uh we'll go with
 
03:46:19.229 --> 03:46:19.239 align:start position:0%
rep con
 
03:46:21.710 --> 03:46:21.720 align:start position:0%
first thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
03:46:23.950 --> 03:46:23.960 align:start position:0%
you for taking my uh
 
03:46:27.149 --> 03:46:27.159 align:start position:0%
question uh can you walk me through that
 
03:46:29.389 --> 03:46:29.399 align:start position:0%
the you know the step one to the last
 
03:46:32.870 --> 03:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
step what is the process of getting this
 
03:46:36.469 --> 03:46:36.479 align:start position:0%
license okay so
 
03:46:39.670 --> 03:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
um so they I may miss some administ
 
03:46:41.389 --> 03:46:41.399 align:start position:0%
strative things if I do I'm sort of the
 
03:46:43.309 --> 03:46:43.319 align:start position:0%
colonel will correct me so you apply for
 
03:46:45.870 --> 03:46:45.880 align:start position:0%
the license um you're given a test date
 
03:46:48.550 --> 03:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
the next available test date uh at this
 
03:46:51.710 --> 03:46:51.720 align:start position:0%
point it's the initial test it's twice a
 
03:46:55.950 --> 03:46:55.960 align:start position:0%
year um it's available so you'd apply
 
03:46:58.630 --> 03:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
for the license send in your money you
 
03:47:01.510 --> 03:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
given a test date and and you take the
 
03:47:03.870 --> 03:47:03.880 align:start position:0%
written if you pass the written so I
 
03:47:05.670 --> 03:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
believe the written in this it I'll give
 
03:47:07.670 --> 03:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
you the next cycle so if you you applied
 
03:47:09.710 --> 03:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
today you'd be given a written date
 
03:47:12.269 --> 03:47:12.279 align:start position:0%
February the end of February pass that
 
03:47:14.950 --> 03:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
written test with minimum score of 70
 
03:47:17.750 --> 03:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
you'd go on to be scheduled for a oral
 
03:47:21.790 --> 03:47:21.800 align:start position:0%
board on a Monday in march sometimes
 
03:47:24.750 --> 03:47:24.760 align:start position:0%
goes into April but usually finishes in
 
03:47:29.510 --> 03:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
March um so once you once you the oral
 
03:47:31.309 --> 03:47:31.319 align:start position:0%
board is comprised now of two sections
 
03:47:32.910 --> 03:47:32.920 align:start position:0%
it used to be three
 
03:47:35.070 --> 03:47:35.080 align:start position:0%
sections the the first section is
 
03:47:36.830 --> 03:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
navigation it could be Land Navigation
 
03:47:39.030 --> 03:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
it could be water navigation all this is
 
03:47:41.189 --> 03:47:41.199 align:start position:0%
on I'm not giving away any super secrets
 
03:47:44.349 --> 03:47:44.359 align:start position:0%
here um all this is on the website uh
 
03:47:46.630 --> 03:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
it's it's some sort of navigation the
 
03:47:48.910 --> 03:47:48.920 align:start position:0%
second section is we used to call a lost
 
03:47:51.630 --> 03:47:51.640 align:start position:0%
person scenario it's actually more
 
03:47:54.630 --> 03:47:54.640 align:start position:0%
accurately I think an emergency scenario
 
03:47:54.640 --> 03:47:55.870 align:start position:0%
accurately I think an emergency scenario
um

03:47:55.870 --> 03:47:55.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:58.429 --> 03:47:58.439 align:start position:0%
so something bad happens somebody could
 
03:47:59.790 --> 03:47:59.800 align:start position:0%
get lost somebody could get hurt
 
03:48:03.510 --> 03:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
somebody could get uh a whole number of
 
03:48:06.389 --> 03:48:06.399 align:start position:0%
litany of things could happen and there
 
03:48:10.750 --> 03:48:10.760 align:start position:0%
are responses that are expected based
 
03:48:14.149 --> 03:48:14.159 align:start position:0%
on the information that is in that list
 
03:48:17.070 --> 03:48:17.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:20.630 --> 03:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
guides can I have a followup Mr chairman
 
03:48:24.189 --> 03:48:24.199 align:start position:0%
followup so all these things
 
03:48:26.990 --> 03:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
happens until the somebody gets the
 
03:48:29.990 --> 03:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
license the policy and the procedure
 
03:48:32.550 --> 03:48:32.560 align:start position:0%
everything is implemented by the
 
03:48:34.469 --> 03:48:34.479 align:start position:0%
commission right it's not just the
 
03:48:36.950 --> 03:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
executive uh director the commission is
 
03:48:38.990 --> 03:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
watching everything that happens with
 
03:48:40.990 --> 03:48:41.000 align:start position:0%
the license in process I believe that
 
03:48:44.550 --> 03:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
it's all in rule that I yes I believe
 
03:48:46.550 --> 03:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
that it's all in rule so it's so it's
 
03:48:48.030 --> 03:48:48.040 align:start position:0%
overseen thank
 
03:48:50.429 --> 03:48:50.439 align:start position:0%
you any further questions representative
 
03:48:52.590 --> 03:48:52.600 align:start position:0%
Smith please thank you Mr chairman and
 
03:48:55.349 --> 03:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question is it
 
03:48:56.670 --> 03:48:56.680 align:start position:0%
safe to say that there's written
 
03:49:00.269 --> 03:49:00.279 align:start position:0%
findings uh during the oral board you
 
03:49:02.750 --> 03:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
bet follow up follow up I didn't I
 
03:49:06.269 --> 03:49:06.279 align:start position:0%
didn't mean to be there is absolutely
 
03:49:08.990 --> 03:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
that I didn't mean to be no that's okay
 
03:49:11.750 --> 03:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
is there any reason why a a written
 
03:49:13.469 --> 03:49:13.479 align:start position:0%
result is not given to the applicant as
 
03:49:17.349 --> 03:49:17.359 align:start position:0%
to why they fail yes uh so we originally
 
03:49:19.990 --> 03:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
did so if you for instance you
 
03:49:22.710 --> 03:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
failed aiming your
 
03:49:26.389 --> 03:49:26.399 align:start position:0%
compass uh and I we originally would
 
03:49:28.950 --> 03:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
immediately correct and I when I say
 
03:49:31.590 --> 03:49:31.600 align:start position:0%
originally I believe it's 10 to 12 years
 
03:49:32.830 --> 03:49:32.840 align:start position:0%
ago this started I can't give you an
 
03:49:34.750 --> 03:49:34.760 align:start position:0%
accurate date I probably should be able
 
03:49:37.630 --> 03:49:37.640 align:start position:0%
to do but I again um and what happens is
 
03:49:39.710 --> 03:49:39.720 align:start position:0%
as soon as we give you the answer and
 
03:49:42.030 --> 03:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
that was a that was
 
03:49:44.870 --> 03:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
now uh that answer is communicated to
 
03:49:47.149 --> 03:49:47.159 align:start position:0%
every single applicant forever more so
 
03:49:49.229 --> 03:49:49.239 align:start position:0%
the test becomes now that should that
 
03:49:53.070 --> 03:49:53.080 align:start position:0%
was a simple one but if I gave if I uh
 
03:49:57.110 --> 03:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
for instance we have a we have right
 
03:49:59.710 --> 03:49:59.720 align:start position:0%
now we had a test and we don't use it
 
03:50:01.750 --> 03:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
anymore so I can give it away we we had
 
03:50:03.910 --> 03:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
a test that was that was a person
 
03:50:06.950 --> 03:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
wandered away from a fishing Expedition
 
03:50:10.750 --> 03:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
um up in my neck of the woods ring
 
03:50:13.590 --> 03:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
and that person walked away and I
 
03:50:17.269 --> 03:50:17.279 align:start position:0%
actually had an applicant come to me
 
03:50:19.349 --> 03:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
when we're as we're doing the test and
 
03:50:21.269 --> 03:50:21.279 align:start position:0%
said oh no no no he's supposed to go
 
03:50:24.710 --> 03:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
looking for wood right now so obviously
 
03:50:26.550 --> 03:50:26.560 align:start position:0%
that had been communicated throughout
 
03:50:32.309 --> 03:50:32.319 align:start position:0%
now there are guide schools um and and
 
03:50:34.950 --> 03:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
those can be you know sometimes they get
 
03:50:36.950 --> 03:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
involved in some of those trying to help
 
03:50:38.910 --> 03:50:38.920 align:start position:0%
people pass well they always help people
 
03:50:41.030 --> 03:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
pass but sometimes they can get involved
 
03:50:43.309 --> 03:50:43.319 align:start position:0%
in those things but it they just over
 
03:50:45.630 --> 03:50:45.640 align:start position:0%
time that gets around you know somebody
 
03:50:47.590 --> 03:50:47.600 align:start position:0%
that pass a test you ask them what tests
 
03:50:49.790 --> 03:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
they had so we're constantly have to an
 
03:50:53.550 --> 03:50:53.560 align:start position:0%
evolve if we actually if if fishing game
 
03:50:56.229 --> 03:50:56.239 align:start position:0%
was forced to actually do tests give
 
03:50:57.830 --> 03:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
away the answers every two weeks and
 
03:51:00.710 --> 03:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
then retest every two weeks there would
 
03:51:04.149 --> 03:51:04.159 align:start position:0%
be multiple people involved in rewriting
 
03:51:04.159 --> 03:51:06.229 align:start position:0%
be multiple people involved in rewriting
tests

03:51:06.229 --> 03:51:06.239 align:start position:0%
tests
 
03:51:08.910 --> 03:51:08.920 align:start position:0%
constantly to be able to provide that to
 
03:51:13.149 --> 03:51:13.159 align:start position:0%
be able provide Integrity down the
 
03:51:15.550 --> 03:51:15.560 align:start position:0%
road any further questions
 
03:51:18.189 --> 03:51:18.199 align:start position:0%
representative Darby please thank you Mr
 
03:51:20.429 --> 03:51:20.439 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
03:51:23.149 --> 03:51:23.159 align:start position:0%
um because there's different um types of
 
03:51:25.950 --> 03:51:25.960 align:start position:0%
guides um can you talk about who makes
 
03:51:28.429 --> 03:51:28.439 align:start position:0%
up the questions for the different uh
 
03:51:31.910 --> 03:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:31.920 --> 03:51:34.910 align:start position:0%
 
categories

03:51:34.910 --> 03:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
categories
 
03:51:37.110 --> 03:51:37.120 align:start position:0%
um if you don't know it's okay to say
 
03:51:39.670 --> 03:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
you don't know and we can pass that on
 
03:51:42.309 --> 03:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
okay it's how much I can give
 
03:51:48.110 --> 03:51:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:52.110 --> 03:51:52.120 align:start position:0%
the to be brutally honest the answers
 
03:51:55.389 --> 03:51:55.399 align:start position:0%
are completely reflective of the
 
03:51:59.510 --> 03:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
incident so uh but it wouldn't make any
 
03:52:01.550 --> 03:52:01.560 align:start position:0%
difference the only difference between a
 
03:52:03.590 --> 03:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
hunting and a fishing guide that came in
 
03:52:06.269 --> 03:52:06.279 align:start position:0%
would be the the evolution that they
 
03:52:10.349 --> 03:52:10.359 align:start position:0%
would be given so for instance if as a
 
03:52:13.870 --> 03:52:13.880 align:start position:0%
fishing guide um I could end up with a
 
03:52:16.229 --> 03:52:16.239 align:start position:0%
person that had a problem in a boat
 
03:52:18.149 --> 03:52:18.159 align:start position:0%
while we were fishing where a hunting
 
03:52:19.910 --> 03:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
guide would come in and maybe they they
 
03:52:21.550 --> 03:52:21.560 align:start position:0%
had a problem with a person in a stand
 
03:52:25.550 --> 03:52:25.560 align:start position:0%
that was hunting but the reaction to
 
03:52:29.750 --> 03:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
those and the followup from the guide
 
03:52:33.990 --> 03:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
is is should be appropriate to the
 
03:52:35.870 --> 03:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
incident but
 
03:52:39.469 --> 03:52:39.479 align:start position:0%
it's cut and dried it's not I will give
 
03:52:41.469 --> 03:52:41.479 align:start position:0%
you an example we had a person that that
 
03:52:44.269 --> 03:52:44.279 align:start position:0%
was asked to do navigation
 
03:52:46.469 --> 03:52:46.479 align:start position:0%
and this is a test that we've had to
 
03:52:48.670 --> 03:52:48.680 align:start position:0%
retire because it's been
 
03:52:52.510 --> 03:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
learned uh but he actually said well I
 
03:52:54.110 --> 03:52:54.120 align:start position:0%
would it happened to be in the early
 
03:52:56.309 --> 03:52:56.319 align:start position:0%
morning said I would navigate by the
 
03:52:58.670 --> 03:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
stars and the co and I looked at at each
 
03:53:02.670 --> 03:53:02.680 align:start position:0%
other and went awesome we never thought
 
03:53:06.309 --> 03:53:06.319 align:start position:0%
of that that's perfect wind yourself up
 
03:53:08.149 --> 03:53:08.159 align:start position:0%
as long as you know how to navigate wisc
 
03:53:10.229 --> 03:53:10.239 align:start position:0%
constellations that's a perfect answer
 
03:53:12.990 --> 03:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
so that's an answer that we wasn't on
 
03:53:18.110 --> 03:53:18.120 align:start position:0%
the paper but certainly we had to accept
 
03:53:20.189 --> 03:53:20.199 align:start position:0%
so does that
 
03:53:23.790 --> 03:53:23.800 align:start position:0%
help as far as the questions um they're
 
03:53:27.710 --> 03:53:27.720 align:start position:0%
developed by in different ways um one of
 
03:53:31.309 --> 03:53:31.319 align:start position:0%
the uh unfortunately recently deceased
 
03:53:33.070 --> 03:53:33.080 align:start position:0%
lieutenants actually came up with the
 
03:53:36.870 --> 03:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
one of the most recent tests follow up
 
03:53:38.670 --> 03:53:38.680 align:start position:0%
thank you I guess I didn't understand so
 
03:53:40.550 --> 03:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
you know don't test somebody that's
 
03:53:42.590 --> 03:53:42.600 align:start position:0%
going off the Sea Coast uh ask different
 
03:53:44.670 --> 03:53:44.680 align:start position:0%
questions than somebody that's you know
 
03:53:48.110 --> 03:53:48.120 align:start position:0%
um trolling in Lake Waki no so that's
 
03:53:50.229 --> 03:53:50.239 align:start position:0%
one of the other one of the other
 
03:53:52.269 --> 03:53:52.279 align:start position:0%
difficulties for guides coming in is
 
03:53:54.710 --> 03:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
that they we have guides that come to us
 
03:53:56.469 --> 03:53:56.479 align:start position:0%
say well I'm just going to run I'm just
 
03:53:58.750 --> 03:53:58.760 align:start position:0%
going to be a fly fishing guide and I'm
 
03:54:00.670 --> 03:54:00.680 align:start position:0%
never going to use a boat well the
 
03:54:02.550 --> 03:54:02.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunate part is we don't have that
 
03:54:03.950 --> 03:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
that category doesn't exist in the state
 
03:54:07.189 --> 03:54:07.199 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire you are a fishing guide
 
03:54:10.229 --> 03:54:10.239 align:start position:0%
period that is
 
03:54:12.389 --> 03:54:12.399 align:start position:0%
east to west north to
 
03:54:14.550 --> 03:54:14.560 align:start position:0%
south I will say it doesn't include you
 
03:54:15.830 --> 03:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
don't have to have a license to be on
 
03:54:19.030 --> 03:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
salt water that helps Vice chair goalie
 
03:54:20.550 --> 03:54:20.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
03:54:20.560 --> 03:54:21.830 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
my

03:54:21.830 --> 03:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
my
 
03:54:24.189 --> 03:54:24.199 align:start position:0%
question being from the fire service and
 
03:54:25.830 --> 03:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
familiar with the oral interviews and
 
03:54:28.110 --> 03:54:28.120 align:start position:0%
things I I I think it's always important
 
03:54:30.790 --> 03:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
that when you go to an
 
03:54:33.389 --> 03:54:33.399 align:start position:0%
interview someone who has a background
 
03:54:34.870 --> 03:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
in fire service or whatever you're
 
03:54:36.870 --> 03:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
talking about is important to be part of
 
03:54:40.469 --> 03:54:40.479 align:start position:0%
that process don't don't you wouldn't
 
03:54:43.349 --> 03:54:43.359 align:start position:0%
you say that saying no guide should be
 
03:54:45.630 --> 03:54:45.640 align:start position:0%
part of this process would do a
 
03:54:48.510 --> 03:54:48.520 align:start position:0%
disservice to this exam versus being
 
03:54:50.110 --> 03:54:50.120 align:start position:0%
involved in knowing what's going on and
 
03:54:51.349 --> 03:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
what it
 
03:54:53.550 --> 03:54:53.560 align:start position:0%
entails I couldn't agree more and coming
 
03:54:55.149 --> 03:54:55.159 align:start position:0%
from the same background I've never I
 
03:54:57.990 --> 03:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
never looked on the other side of taking
 
03:55:00.790 --> 03:55:00.800 align:start position:0%
a test in the fire service and looked
 
03:55:02.590 --> 03:55:02.600 align:start position:0%
across the table and found somebody that
 
03:55:05.269 --> 03:55:05.279 align:start position:0%
never fought fire so I I absolutely
 
03:55:07.510 --> 03:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
agree and that and that was why we
 
03:55:09.550 --> 03:55:09.560 align:start position:0%
initially became involved was
 
03:55:11.950 --> 03:55:11.960 align:start position:0%
Advocate almost exactly the opposite of
 
03:55:14.510 --> 03:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
what would be portrayed here to advocate
 
03:55:14.520 --> 03:55:16.510 align:start position:0%
what would be portrayed here to advocate
for

03:55:16.510 --> 03:55:16.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:55:19.229 --> 03:55:19.239 align:start position:0%
guides thank you representative
 
03:55:21.550 --> 03:55:21.560 align:start position:0%
Harvey thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
03:55:24.830 --> 03:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question so um in listening to
 
03:55:27.590 --> 03:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
some of your examples am I correct in
 
03:55:30.950 --> 03:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
thinking that the oral exam is kind of a
 
03:55:34.229 --> 03:55:34.239 align:start position:0%
practicum exam absolutely followup
 
03:55:38.790 --> 03:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
please followup so um in a practicum you
 
03:55:40.790 --> 03:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
you can either do it or not do it you
 
03:55:43.750 --> 03:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
can you know whether you can do it or
 
03:55:47.269 --> 03:55:47.279 align:start position:0%
you know whoops I not able to do this so
 
03:55:52.309 --> 03:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
even without um you know feedback from
 
03:55:55.950 --> 03:55:55.960 align:start position:0%
the uh from how you did on the test are
 
03:55:58.229 --> 03:55:58.239 align:start position:0%
in your opinion are the the kinds of
 
03:56:00.429 --> 03:56:00.439 align:start position:0%
things you're asking in the oral exam
 
03:56:02.469 --> 03:56:02.479 align:start position:0%
kind of obvious to the person taking it
 
03:56:06.269 --> 03:56:06.279 align:start position:0%
that they're able or not able to do um
 
03:56:08.750 --> 03:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
what's being asked in the oral exam
 
03:56:10.469 --> 03:56:10.479 align:start position:0%
because that seemed to be her problem
 
03:56:12.710 --> 03:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
I'll give you two examples one so as far
 
03:56:14.670 --> 03:56:14.680 align:start position:0%
as the navigation it's a it's a fairly
 
03:56:16.189 --> 03:56:16.199 align:start position:0%
cut and dried thing some people walk
 
03:56:19.309 --> 03:56:19.319 align:start position:0%
away and have no idea what they did
 
03:56:21.590 --> 03:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
wrong on the other hand at this last
 
03:56:24.070 --> 03:56:24.080 align:start position:0%
fall examination we had an individual
 
03:56:27.429 --> 03:56:27.439 align:start position:0%
that went away from the navigation
 
03:56:29.469 --> 03:56:29.479 align:start position:0%
portion came back and shook his head
 
03:56:30.870 --> 03:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
like this and said I know exactly what I
 
03:56:33.590 --> 03:56:33.600 align:start position:0%
did wrong um on the other
 
03:56:37.070 --> 03:56:37.080 align:start position:0%
hand we have folks that when responding
 
03:56:40.710 --> 03:56:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:44.349 --> 03:56:44.359 align:start position:0%
uh issue that comes up that
 
03:56:44.359 --> 03:56:46.229 align:start position:0%
uh issue that comes up that
that

03:56:46.229 --> 03:56:46.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:56:48.670 --> 03:56:48.680 align:start position:0%
um again I'm struggling not giving no a
 
03:56:52.590 --> 03:56:52.600 align:start position:0%
test um that may come up that that
 
03:56:54.950 --> 03:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
requires whether it be medical or it be
 
03:56:57.550 --> 03:56:57.560 align:start position:0%
technical knowledge they may not know
 
03:57:00.630 --> 03:57:00.640 align:start position:0%
that they uh for instance failed because
 
03:57:02.429 --> 03:57:02.439 align:start position:0%
they didn't take care of the boat or
 
03:57:04.269 --> 03:57:04.279 align:start position:0%
they didn't take care of the person so
 
03:57:07.590 --> 03:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
does that does that help I mean they're
 
03:57:07.600 --> 03:57:09.309 align:start position:0%
does that does that help I mean they're
not

03:57:09.309 --> 03:57:09.319 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:57:09.319 --> 03:57:10.469 align:start position:0%
not
thank

03:57:10.469 --> 03:57:10.479 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:57:13.110 --> 03:57:13.120 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
03:57:15.830 --> 03:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
Brown uh thank you Mr chair and thanks
 
03:57:16.990 --> 03:57:17.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
03:57:19.189 --> 03:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
question following up on representative
 
03:57:22.550 --> 03:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
Harvey a little bit so we heard earlier
 
03:57:25.309 --> 03:57:25.319 align:start position:0%
that it's a one question oral exam and
 
03:57:26.630 --> 03:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
that doesn't sound like what you're
 
03:57:28.870 --> 03:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
saying you're saying it's a structured
 
03:57:30.510 --> 03:57:30.520 align:start position:0%
test similar to doing a structured
 
03:57:32.630 --> 03:57:32.640 align:start position:0%
interview you have three people on the
 
03:57:37.389 --> 03:57:37.399 align:start position:0%
board all listening to the same question
 
03:57:39.630 --> 03:57:39.640 align:start position:0%
independently um grading that question
 
03:57:41.830 --> 03:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
and at the end cating their scores is
 
03:57:44.750 --> 03:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
that correct that is correct okay thank
 
03:57:46.910 --> 03:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
you and follow follow
 
03:57:49.750 --> 03:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
up this is a different question we also
 
03:57:52.510 --> 03:57:52.520 align:start position:0%
heard this morning uh earlier in
 
03:57:54.950 --> 03:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
testimony that it seems like there are
 
03:57:57.510 --> 03:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
those that believe that there have been
 
03:58:00.189 --> 03:58:00.199 align:start position:0%
instances where a guide on this board
 
03:58:02.030 --> 03:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
might have voted a certain way to keep
 
03:58:04.229 --> 03:58:04.239 align:start position:0%
someone out of a job have you ever
 
03:58:04.239 --> 03:58:05.710 align:start position:0%
someone out of a job have you ever
experienced

03:58:05.710 --> 03:58:05.720 align:start position:0%
experienced
 
03:58:09.070 --> 03:58:09.080 align:start position:0%
that not personally I'm obviously that
 
03:58:09.080 --> 03:58:09.830 align:start position:0%
that not personally I'm obviously that
have

03:58:09.830 --> 03:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:58:14.870 --> 03:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
not obvious be the guy since Co um uh
 
03:58:16.349 --> 03:58:16.359 align:start position:0%
with I think one exception one day I
 
03:58:20.469 --> 03:58:20.479 align:start position:0%
couldn't make it uh I have not and and
 
03:58:22.070 --> 03:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
again I can't reiterate enough there
 
03:58:23.830 --> 03:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
aren't enough guides this isn't a
 
03:58:27.149 --> 03:58:27.159 align:start position:0%
limitation there this is if I could get
 
03:58:29.149 --> 03:58:29.159 align:start position:0%
right now I have three people that call
 
03:58:32.349 --> 03:58:32.359 align:start position:0%
me at the end of every testing to say
 
03:58:35.750 --> 03:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:39.189 --> 03:58:39.199 align:start position:0%
hire it is that dire a need to get
 
03:58:40.469 --> 03:58:40.479 align:start position:0%
people into the field to be able to
 
03:58:41.790 --> 03:58:41.800 align:start position:0%
perform this
 
03:58:47.110 --> 03:58:47.120 align:start position:0%
function thank you thank you any further
 
03:58:49.349 --> 03:58:49.359 align:start position:0%

03:59:14.670 --> 03:59:14.680 align:start position:0%
afternoon I guess I want to speak in
 
03:59:15.990 --> 03:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
support of this
 
03:59:18.790 --> 03:59:18.800 align:start position:0%
bill and I I think I'd like to just
 
03:59:22.550 --> 03:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
start out quickly as quick as I can
 
03:59:24.550 --> 03:59:24.560 align:start position:0%
introducing myself
 
03:59:29.429 --> 03:59:29.439 align:start position:0%
and uh my name is Jody person I'm
 
03:59:34.070 --> 03:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
57 uh I've been a Avid uh bass I've been
 
03:59:36.710 --> 03:59:36.720 align:start position:0%
bass fishing for over 30 years
 
03:59:39.950 --> 03:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
professionally non-professionally
 
03:59:42.670 --> 03:59:42.680 align:start position:0%
um I went and decided that I would like
 
03:59:42.680 --> 03:59:44.229 align:start position:0%
um I went and decided that I would like
to

03:59:44.229 --> 03:59:44.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:59:47.469 --> 03:59:47.479 align:start position:0%
uh become a guide I got to this point in
 
03:59:49.429 --> 03:59:49.439 align:start position:0%
my life where I wanted
 
03:59:53.189 --> 03:59:53.199 align:start position:0%
to I thought it would be a good idea um
 
03:59:56.389 --> 03:59:56.399 align:start position:0%
to be a GU and take people out and share
 
04:00:00.870 --> 04:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
my 40 Years of knowledge um anyways I'll
 
04:00:03.070 --> 04:00:03.080 align:start position:0%
I'll explain I I started with doing the
 
04:00:05.910 --> 04:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
paper test I signed up and got and did
 
04:00:10.269 --> 04:00:10.279 align:start position:0%
the paper test um there was problems
 
04:00:12.510 --> 04:00:12.520 align:start position:0%
with the paper test I failed the first
 
04:00:16.189 --> 04:00:16.199 align:start position:0%
time the second time um there was
 
04:00:18.750 --> 04:00:18.760 align:start position:0%
problems with the paper test but um I'm
 
04:00:21.630 --> 04:00:21.640 align:start position:0%
sorry what was your Kevin Jord Kevin
 
04:00:24.870 --> 04:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
Jordan here he actually took the reign
 
04:00:26.550 --> 04:00:26.560 align:start position:0%
of the problems that there was with the
 
04:00:29.990 --> 04:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
paper test and he corrected them because
 
04:00:31.349 --> 04:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of questions on there
 
04:00:33.550 --> 04:00:33.560 align:start position:0%
that had absolutely nothing to do with
 
04:00:37.469 --> 04:00:37.479 align:start position:0%
fishing so I would congratulate on on
 
04:00:39.790 --> 04:00:39.800 align:start position:0%
him getting a hold of that and getting
 
04:00:42.830 --> 04:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
the paper test in line so I finally
 
04:00:44.950 --> 04:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
passed the paper test and I went for the
 
04:00:44.960 --> 04:00:45.910 align:start position:0%
passed the paper test and I went for the
oral

04:00:45.910 --> 04:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
oral
 
04:00:51.229 --> 04:00:51.239 align:start position:0%
exam and I failed the map en
 
04:00:54.710 --> 04:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
Compass uh bad I was not ready for that
 
04:00:57.550 --> 04:00:57.560 align:start position:0%
I went in and I can admit that I was
 
04:01:00.990 --> 04:01:01.000 align:start position:0%
definitely not ready for that I failed
 
04:01:02.990 --> 04:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
for that so I went
 
04:01:06.950 --> 04:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
and studied and to uh took a course
 
04:01:09.110 --> 04:01:09.120 align:start position:0%
somewhere and everything you know and
 
04:01:10.510 --> 04:01:10.520 align:start position:0%
and just went through and I learned a
 
04:01:12.110 --> 04:01:12.120 align:start position:0%
lot and
 
04:01:16.590 --> 04:01:16.600 align:start position:0%
um then uh I went in for my second time
 
04:01:20.630 --> 04:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
theor exam and um I passed the map en
 
04:01:23.469 --> 04:01:23.479 align:start position:0%
Compass I believe it's I've been this
 
04:01:25.349 --> 04:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
process has been five years now going on
 
04:01:27.269 --> 04:01:27.279 align:start position:0%
six years so I might be a little fuzzy
 
04:01:29.550 --> 04:01:29.560 align:start position:0%
on how things happened but I'm giving
 
04:01:31.750 --> 04:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
you the truth as as far as I can
 
04:01:31.760 --> 04:01:32.750 align:start position:0%
you the truth as as far as I can
remember

04:01:32.750 --> 04:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
remember
 
04:01:38.990 --> 04:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
it um the second oral exam I failed um I
 
04:01:40.510 --> 04:01:40.520 align:start position:0%
made it through map Encompass I believe
 
04:01:43.550 --> 04:01:43.560 align:start position:0%
but then I failed on the oral part of it
 
04:01:45.870 --> 04:01:45.880 align:start position:0%
and um of course you got to wait when
 
04:01:47.269 --> 04:01:47.279 align:start position:0%
you when you fail twice you got to wait
 
04:01:51.189 --> 04:01:51.199 align:start position:0%
a year so here I am waiting a year so
 
04:01:54.030 --> 04:01:54.040 align:start position:0%
anyways I come back I had to they make
 
04:01:55.710 --> 04:01:55.720 align:start position:0%
it startop from the beginning again so I
 
04:01:57.550 --> 04:01:57.560 align:start position:0%
had to do the paper test I passed the
 
04:01:57.560 --> 04:01:58.950 align:start position:0%
had to do the paper test I passed the
paper

04:01:58.950 --> 04:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
paper
 
04:02:01.429 --> 04:02:01.439 align:start position:0%
test I got to the
 
04:02:05.189 --> 04:02:05.199 align:start position:0%
oral my my thing was on the oral oral
 
04:02:08.750 --> 04:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
pot when they kept failing you they
 
04:02:10.710 --> 04:02:10.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't tell you why you failed we've
 
04:02:12.309 --> 04:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
already heard that spoke today I don't
 
04:02:15.630 --> 04:02:15.640 align:start position:0%
want to repeat on that but it was it it
 
04:02:17.990 --> 04:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
just seemed like every every time I
 
04:02:19.750 --> 04:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
would ask the people that were there
 
04:02:21.950 --> 04:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
there'd be conservation officer there
 
04:02:25.189 --> 04:02:25.199 align:start position:0%
and and uh gu Association rep there and
 
04:02:27.189 --> 04:02:27.199 align:start position:0%
I would ask the officer well why did I
 
04:02:29.630 --> 04:02:29.640 align:start position:0%
fail and he would go like they usually
 
04:02:32.189 --> 04:02:32.199 align:start position:0%
go like this and they paint they point
 
04:02:33.670 --> 04:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
to the guide
 
04:02:37.030 --> 04:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
Association um representative and then
 
04:02:38.510 --> 04:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
that representative wouldn't wouldn't
 
04:02:40.790 --> 04:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
tell you you know what you did wrong and
 
04:02:42.670 --> 04:02:42.680 align:start position:0%
I was like well how am I going to learn
 
04:02:44.630 --> 04:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
how am I going to learn to to do this
 
04:02:46.670 --> 04:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
and then I'm off and I got to wait
 
04:02:51.149 --> 04:02:51.159 align:start position:0%
another year and start again but
 
04:02:55.510 --> 04:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
um uh so anyways that's that's that's my
 
04:02:59.550 --> 04:02:59.560 align:start position:0%
story of where I've been with that and
 
04:03:03.110 --> 04:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
um I want I guess I'll just jump to why
 
04:03:05.990 --> 04:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
I bu why I'm a a supporter of house
 
04:03:06.000 --> 04:03:06.790 align:start position:0%
I bu why I'm a a supporter of house
build

04:03:06.790 --> 04:03:06.800 align:start position:0%
build
 
04:03:10.110 --> 04:03:10.120 align:start position:0%
1228 is I really think that it needs a
 
04:03:12.550 --> 04:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
we need a committee that needs to be a
 
04:03:14.110 --> 04:03:14.120 align:start position:0%
committee to get some kind of more
 
04:03:17.070 --> 04:03:17.080 align:start position:0%
structure to this because it really is
 
04:03:19.990 --> 04:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
such a broad thing for one person to try
 
04:03:23.910 --> 04:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
to run this whole thing when you have if
 
04:03:25.269 --> 04:03:25.279 align:start position:0%
you can have a committee you're going to
 
04:03:29.309 --> 04:03:29.319 align:start position:0%
have uh more than one per one mind
 
04:03:32.349 --> 04:03:32.359 align:start position:0%
working on this
 
04:03:34.990 --> 04:03:35.000 align:start position:0%
um because the way it's set up right now
 
04:03:39.550 --> 04:03:39.560 align:start position:0%
it's just I I feel it's not a fair
 
04:03:43.269 --> 04:03:43.279 align:start position:0%
um it's not a fair playing field to to
 
04:03:44.309 --> 04:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
get in
 
04:03:47.590 --> 04:03:47.600 align:start position:0%
here um I think the committee would be
 
04:03:48.550 --> 04:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
able to
 
04:03:50.870 --> 04:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
address um like you
 
04:03:54.030 --> 04:03:54.040 align:start position:0%
heard uh from someone earlier that this
 
04:03:56.670 --> 04:03:56.680 align:start position:0%
this license is so broad the the fishing
 
04:03:58.269 --> 04:03:58.279 align:start position:0%
license the guide fishing license is
 
04:04:01.790 --> 04:04:01.800 align:start position:0%
Broad from border to border Rivers
 
04:04:04.630 --> 04:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
camping going out in boats I can take
 
04:04:06.710 --> 04:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
people clamming I mean it's it's it's
 
04:04:09.229 --> 04:04:09.239 align:start position:0%
just it's it's all over the place and it
 
04:04:12.830 --> 04:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
you know for myself I'm just like uh I
 
04:04:14.510 --> 04:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
want to do freshwater bass fishing out
 
04:04:16.309 --> 04:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
of a boat you know and I think if
 
04:04:17.990 --> 04:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
there's a committee I think the
 
04:04:19.830 --> 04:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
committee could actually break things in
 
04:04:22.389 --> 04:04:22.399 align:start position:0%
like DMV does you don't you don't go in
 
04:04:25.189 --> 04:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
and get a license for driving a car and
 
04:04:27.429 --> 04:04:27.439 align:start position:0%
you can hop in a semi or this this
 
04:04:30.189 --> 04:04:30.199 align:start position:0%
weight or this that you know I I think
 
04:04:31.830 --> 04:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
it it needs to be structured out more
 
04:04:33.710 --> 04:04:33.720 align:start position:0%
with that you know a committee would
 
04:04:35.309 --> 04:04:35.319 align:start position:0%
really be good because they would be
 
04:04:38.030 --> 04:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
able to say you know let's make a class
 
04:04:39.229 --> 04:04:39.239 align:start position:0%
one and
 
04:04:42.510 --> 04:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
two uh open water fishing license you
 
04:04:44.149 --> 04:04:44.159 align:start position:0%
know it's it's it's not I don't think
 
04:04:47.630 --> 04:04:47.640 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of work I just think uh you
 
04:04:49.229 --> 04:04:49.239 align:start position:0%
know that's that's why we need a
 
04:04:50.910 --> 04:04:50.920 align:start position:0%
committee and
 
04:04:53.429 --> 04:04:53.439 align:start position:0%
um as far as the god Association is
 
04:04:55.670 --> 04:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
being involved in this right now I'm I'm
 
04:04:57.630 --> 04:04:57.640 align:start position:0%
not a lawyer or a judge but I believe
 
04:05:00.510 --> 04:05:00.520 align:start position:0%
it's 100% illegal to have a private
 
04:05:05.670 --> 04:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
entity joining with a department of New
 
04:05:08.269 --> 04:05:08.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire joining those two entities pie
 
04:05:11.030 --> 04:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
together and having this private entity
 
04:05:13.550 --> 04:05:13.560 align:start position:0%
making the decision whether I can get a
 
04:05:15.550 --> 04:05:15.560 align:start position:0%
license or not when they're uh when
 
04:05:17.229 --> 04:05:17.239 align:start position:0%
they're hired
 
04:05:19.950 --> 04:05:19.960 align:start position:0%
guides they're guides for hire I mean
 
04:05:22.429 --> 04:05:22.439 align:start position:0%
it's it's a 100% conflict of interest I
 
04:05:24.910 --> 04:05:24.920 align:start position:0%
mean I I'm not a lawyer and I'm not a
 
04:05:26.269 --> 04:05:26.279 align:start position:0%
judge but I have friends that are
 
04:05:28.950 --> 04:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
lawyers and a I know a retired judge and
 
04:05:31.510 --> 04:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
I've talked and it's like I mean it's
 
04:05:33.469 --> 04:05:33.479 align:start position:0%
just it's crazy it's just just a little
 
04:05:35.910 --> 04:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
bit out of control and I don't
 
04:05:35.920 --> 04:05:36.870 align:start position:0%
bit out of control and I don't
understand

04:05:36.870 --> 04:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
understand
 
04:05:36.880 --> 04:05:38.670 align:start position:0%
understand
why

04:05:38.670 --> 04:05:38.680 align:start position:0%
why
 
04:05:40.790 --> 04:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
you know you you you think about this
 
04:05:40.800 --> 04:05:42.309 align:start position:0%
you know you you you think about this
guide

04:05:42.309 --> 04:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
guide
 
04:05:45.389 --> 04:05:45.399 align:start position:0%
Association uh there it's it's almost
 
04:05:47.309 --> 04:05:47.319 align:start position:0%
like putting them above the fish and
 
04:05:49.870 --> 04:05:49.880 align:start position:0%
game offices that are
 
04:05:52.950 --> 04:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
trained they're the ones when the phone
 
04:05:55.110 --> 04:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
call gets made to go out and find that
 
04:05:57.830 --> 04:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
person and save a life and do everything
 
04:06:00.309 --> 04:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
why why are we jumping over the paper
 
04:06:01.870 --> 04:06:01.880 align:start position:0%
test is given
 
04:06:05.750 --> 04:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
by uh fishing game conservation offices
 
04:06:08.149 --> 04:06:08.159 align:start position:0%
only the god Association is not involved
 
04:06:10.830 --> 04:06:10.840 align:start position:0%
with that why I think that it just would
 
04:06:12.469 --> 04:06:12.479 align:start position:0%
be fair
 
04:06:16.349 --> 04:06:16.359 align:start position:0%
if the the oral is given too why do we
 
04:06:19.550 --> 04:06:19.560 align:start position:0%
need a guide Association involved with
 
04:06:22.030 --> 04:06:22.040 align:start position:0%
that which is a 100% conflict of
 
04:06:25.269 --> 04:06:25.279 align:start position:0%
interest when you have the offices that
 
04:06:27.910 --> 04:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
the ones that are actually trained in
 
04:06:30.469 --> 04:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
it they're the ones that thank you Mr
 
04:06:32.870 --> 04:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
person you're gone over your time and we
 
04:06:35.309 --> 04:06:35.319 align:start position:0%
getting close to the uh well we've gone
 
04:06:37.309 --> 04:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
over time for this hearing but uh if
 
04:06:38.189 --> 04:06:38.199 align:start position:0%
you've got anything anything new that
 
04:06:39.790 --> 04:06:39.800 align:start position:0%
you haven't covered already please state
 
04:06:42.189 --> 04:06:42.199 align:start position:0%
it now and otherwise uh I thank you for
 
04:06:44.710 --> 04:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
your testimony are there any questions I
 
04:06:46.630 --> 04:06:46.640 align:start position:0%
think about that's about all I would
 
04:06:48.910 --> 04:06:48.920 align:start position:0%
like to say at this time I I'll let uh
 
04:06:50.349 --> 04:06:50.359 align:start position:0%
you go to questions then and and
 
04:06:52.510 --> 04:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
representative Brown you're recognizes
 
04:06:54.349 --> 04:06:54.359 align:start position:0%
ask questions thank you Mr chair thank
 
04:06:57.309 --> 04:06:57.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:59.870 --> 04:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
testimony are you willing would you be
 
04:07:02.550 --> 04:07:02.560 align:start position:0%
willing to accept from the board when
 
04:07:04.870 --> 04:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
they say you failed the oral test that
 
04:07:07.950 --> 04:07:07.960 align:start position:0%
you you didn't pass this section as
 
04:07:10.790 --> 04:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
opposed to as a previous testifier said
 
04:07:13.630 --> 04:07:13.640 align:start position:0%
not giving you the question but you fail
 
04:07:16.070 --> 04:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
in this section do they tell you that
 
04:07:17.910 --> 04:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
and would that be your
 
04:07:20.710 --> 04:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
preference um don't know if I understand
 
04:07:23.670 --> 04:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
you mean like if they so you didn't pass
 
04:07:25.630 --> 04:07:25.640 align:start position:0%
navigation but you don't have to know
 
04:07:28.790 --> 04:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
the exact question or the
 
04:07:33.189 --> 04:07:33.199 align:start position:0%
answer no I I think that should be given
 
04:07:36.830 --> 04:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
you know um as far as that map ENC
 
04:07:38.550 --> 04:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
Compass stuff
 
04:07:41.070 --> 04:07:41.080 align:start position:0%
um they said they they weren't supposed
 
04:07:42.309 --> 04:07:42.319 align:start position:0%
to tell me
 
04:07:44.550 --> 04:07:44.560 align:start position:0%
and you know because you've heard the
 
04:07:47.790 --> 04:07:47.800 align:start position:0%
reasons why but it's like I guess they
 
04:07:51.429 --> 04:07:51.439 align:start position:0%
do that the oral is two separate the
 
04:07:54.269 --> 04:07:54.279 align:start position:0%
oral the compass M Compass is one part
 
04:07:56.590 --> 04:07:56.600 align:start position:0%
of the oral and the second is the
 
04:07:59.309 --> 04:07:59.319 align:start position:0%
scenario the scenario is where it really
 
04:08:01.149 --> 04:08:01.159 align:start position:0%
gets you know I don't have a problem
 
04:08:02.910 --> 04:08:02.920 align:start position:0%
with the paper test the compass Ming
 
04:08:04.710 --> 04:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
compass and stuff but when the scenario
 
04:08:07.429 --> 04:08:07.439 align:start position:0%
gets going the scenario starts and I
 
04:08:09.229 --> 04:08:09.239 align:start position:0%
know all a sudden it just starts taking
 
04:08:12.070 --> 04:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
a life of its own and it goes and goes
 
04:08:14.349 --> 04:08:14.359 align:start position:0%
depending on how if you rescue one
 
04:08:16.030 --> 04:08:16.040 align:start position:0%
person I mean if if you're going to go
 
04:08:17.830 --> 04:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
rescue one person there's a scene
 
04:08:19.950 --> 04:08:19.960 align:start position:0%
there's probably three two or three
 
04:08:21.670 --> 04:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
different ways you could go about it and
 
04:08:23.070 --> 04:08:23.080 align:start position:0%
you're going to come out with the same
 
04:08:26.030 --> 04:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
income I mean the same outcome you're
 
04:08:27.830 --> 04:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
going to save the person's life it's
 
04:08:31.349 --> 04:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
just it's it's very hard to go through
 
04:08:35.910 --> 04:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
that oral scenario and say what they
 
04:08:38.149 --> 04:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
want to hear I mean this
 
04:08:39.590 --> 04:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
the three different ways to rescue
 
04:08:43.710 --> 04:08:43.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:46.590 --> 04:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
you uh representative
 
04:08:51.030 --> 04:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
paig thank you um so a previous speaker
 
04:08:52.710 --> 04:08:52.720 align:start position:0%
said that there's a lot of structure to
 
04:08:55.790 --> 04:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
the test there's a scoring rubric and
 
04:08:59.269 --> 04:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
the various uh examiners collate their
 
04:09:01.630 --> 04:09:01.640 align:start position:0%
scores at the end of this process when
 
04:09:04.630 --> 04:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
you at the end of this process having
 
04:09:06.670 --> 04:09:06.680 align:start position:0%
having not received a pass received a
 
04:09:10.149 --> 04:09:10.159 align:start position:0%
fail yeah you just see you failed or do
 
04:09:12.510 --> 04:09:12.520 align:start position:0%
you get some version of your scores for
 
04:09:14.910 --> 04:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
the different sections on the oral
 
04:09:18.109 --> 04:09:18.119 align:start position:0%
correct I get absolutely okay goose egg
 
04:09:21.229 --> 04:09:21.239 align:start position:0%
thank you I get I get just stared at
 
04:09:24.590 --> 04:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
and it's just it's you know it shouldn't
 
04:09:27.950 --> 04:09:27.960 align:start position:0%
be like that I I have I have 100%
 
04:09:30.149 --> 04:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
respect for these conservation officers

this piece of legislation um mainly over

the concerns of uh the role of the guide

um in sporting whether you're Hunting

Fishing um or just just exploring
 
04:10:41.149 --> 04:10:41.159 align:start position:0%
outdoor the outdoor spaces um is so
 
04:10:43.750 --> 04:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
incredibly important and we think that
 
04:10:46.870 --> 04:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
um the way the system works now um is
 
04:10:48.750 --> 04:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
has worked and it continues to work to
 
04:10:51.710 --> 04:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
provide the safest safest experience uh
 
04:10:54.269 --> 04:10:54.279 align:start position:0%
for sportsmen and women across the state
 
04:10:56.750 --> 04:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
um the rigorous education requirements
 
04:10:59.950 --> 04:10:59.960 align:start position:0%
um the testing process um as you heard
 
04:11:01.550 --> 04:11:01.560 align:start position:0%
um the guides that are involved in this
 
04:11:03.910 --> 04:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
testing process um with the with the
 
04:11:05.510 --> 04:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
conservation officers it's done on a
 
04:11:08.269 --> 04:11:08.279 align:start position:0%
voluntary basis um there are not many
 
04:11:10.389 --> 04:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
guides out there making a full-time
 
04:11:12.990 --> 04:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
living uh working as a guide um most of
 
04:11:14.830 --> 04:11:14.840 align:start position:0%
these folks are tied into their
 
04:11:16.429 --> 04:11:16.439 align:start position:0%
communities whether they're Avid
 
04:11:20.790 --> 04:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
fishermen Aid Anglers um Avid um
 
04:11:23.870 --> 04:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
Hunters um they're very you know an
 
04:11:26.990 --> 04:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
integral part um of outdoor recreation
 
04:11:29.269 --> 04:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
and we think that this bill um could put
 
04:11:31.830 --> 04:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
some of that at risk um we believe that
 
04:11:34.389 --> 04:11:34.399 align:start position:0%
having the guides uh play a role um in
 
04:11:36.830 --> 04:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
the testing um is incredibly important
 
04:11:39.429 --> 04:11:39.439 align:start position:0%
to ensuring the safety for sportsmen um
 
04:11:41.950 --> 04:11:41.960 align:start position:0%
when you you know to you know we've
 
04:11:43.189 --> 04:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
talked about different licenses you've
 
04:11:44.109 --> 04:11:44.119 align:start position:0%
heard testimony about different
 
04:11:46.670 --> 04:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
licensing across the state um the you
 
04:11:48.070 --> 04:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
know you're going to a doctor for a
 
04:11:49.309 --> 04:11:49.319 align:start position:0%
procedure you want to see the doctor
 
04:11:50.550 --> 04:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
that's done the procedure you need the
 
04:11:53.189 --> 04:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
most times um when you are looking to
 
04:11:54.710 --> 04:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
hire a plumber for something in your
 
04:11:56.349 --> 04:11:56.359 align:start position:0%
house you want the best you want someone
 
04:11:58.269 --> 04:11:58.279 align:start position:0%
who has the most experience in doing it
 
04:12:00.550 --> 04:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
and we think that the Rings true uh for
 
04:12:02.950 --> 04:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
guides um hunting and fishing guides as
 
04:12:05.070 --> 04:12:05.080 align:start position:0%
well um hunting and fishing in New
 
04:12:07.870 --> 04:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is also a source of Tourism uh
 
04:12:11.189 --> 04:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
recently um the out the Outdoor
 
04:12:13.670 --> 04:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
Recreation Department inside Bea listed
 
04:12:15.189 --> 04:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
hunting and fishing as one of the
 
04:12:16.910 --> 04:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
leading sources of Tourism dollars in
 
04:12:19.830 --> 04:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um it's incredibly
 
04:12:21.309 --> 04:12:21.319 align:start position:0%
important that well-trained guides are
 
04:12:23.389 --> 04:12:23.399 align:start position:0%
available to meet uh non-residents when
 
04:12:24.870 --> 04:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
they come here looking to take advantage
 
04:12:27.269 --> 04:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
of the unique um and vast outdoor
 
04:12:30.109 --> 04:12:30.119 align:start position:0%
recreation opportunities we have um you
 
04:12:31.790 --> 04:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
can be hunting in the North country and
 
04:12:33.349 --> 04:12:33.359 align:start position:0%
fishing off the coast of the ocean all
 
04:12:34.910 --> 04:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
within a couple of hours if you're lucky
 
04:12:37.389 --> 04:12:37.399 align:start position:0%
enough to do it so we think that the the
 
04:12:40.229 --> 04:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
the current process works um it's not
 
04:12:42.630 --> 04:12:42.640 align:start position:0%
here to say it's perfect um by any means
 
04:12:44.790 --> 04:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
and there's obviously uh always open to
 
04:12:46.109 --> 04:12:46.119 align:start position:0%
conversations on how we can make the
 
04:12:48.710 --> 04:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
process more efficient um as long as
 
04:12:52.590 --> 04:12:52.600 align:start position:0%
we're ensuring that safety um is key um
 
04:12:53.790 --> 04:12:53.800 align:start position:0%
these are folks that are putting you
 
04:12:55.630 --> 04:12:55.640 align:start position:0%
know folks that are coming putting up
 
04:12:57.790 --> 04:12:57.800 align:start position:0%
hard-earned dollars to get to get a
 
04:13:00.030 --> 04:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
service um and we need to make sure that
 
04:13:00.990 --> 04:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
they're getting what they're what
 
04:13:03.229 --> 04:13:03.239 align:start position:0%
they're paying for so uh with that I
 
04:13:04.510 --> 04:13:04.520 align:start position:0%
want to be respectful of your time and
 
04:13:05.830 --> 04:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions that you
 
04:13:09.109 --> 04:13:09.119 align:start position:0%
might have does anybody have any
 
04:13:15.269 --> 04:13:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:17.990 --> 04:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
you uh chair now recognizes Richard
 
04:13:20.269 --> 04:13:20.279 align:start position:0%
Burnham representing
 
04:13:23.750 --> 04:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
himself asked for 5 to 10 minutes if you
 
04:13:25.189 --> 04:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
can keep that on the Lower Side that'd
 
04:13:29.750 --> 04:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:31.870 --> 04:13:31.880 align:start position:0%
behind thank you everyone my name is
 
04:13:33.590 --> 04:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
Richard Burnham from Wolf bro New
 
04:13:36.429 --> 04:13:36.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire also very similar situation
 
04:13:38.870 --> 04:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
where I've tried going through the
 
04:13:41.710 --> 04:13:41.720 align:start position:0%
guides test through uh two or three
 
04:13:43.830 --> 04:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
times within the course of several years
 
04:13:46.309 --> 04:13:46.319 align:start position:0%
in which I've passed the written exam
 
04:13:47.990 --> 04:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
and then gotten to the oral board and
 
04:13:50.429 --> 04:13:50.439 align:start position:0%
gone through a few of the sequences But
 
04:13:53.670 --> 04:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
ultimately failed and I come to hear to
 
04:13:55.790 --> 04:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
you guys today in order to address the
 
04:13:59.070 --> 04:13:59.080 align:start position:0%
fact of the whole conflict of interest
 
04:14:01.349 --> 04:14:01.359 align:start position:0%
and one thing that gets me is for the
 
04:14:02.670 --> 04:14:02.680 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire especially New
 
04:14:04.630 --> 04:14:04.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fishing game for the hunter
 
04:14:06.229 --> 04:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
education course and the Trapper
 
04:14:07.950 --> 04:14:07.960 align:start position:0%
education course
 
04:14:09.309 --> 04:14:09.319 align:start position:0%
that is strictly run by the New
 
04:14:11.710 --> 04:14:11.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fishing game officers now for
 
04:14:15.790 --> 04:14:15.800 align:start position:0%
the guides test we have the guides and
 
04:14:18.109 --> 04:14:18.119 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire fishing game officers
 
04:14:19.950 --> 04:14:19.960 align:start position:0%
as part of that board and normally
 
04:14:21.750 --> 04:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
there's only two instead of three at
 
04:14:22.950 --> 04:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
least that's what I've experienced
 
04:14:26.710 --> 04:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
usually one guide and one fishing game
 
04:14:29.389 --> 04:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
officer and now the biggest thing with
 
04:14:31.790 --> 04:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
me that I bring up is the whole
 
04:14:35.189 --> 04:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
accountability aspect of it all and with
 
04:14:38.269 --> 04:14:38.279 align:start position:0%
a guide being on the
 
04:14:40.950 --> 04:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
board he may be qualified and have the
 
04:14:44.710 --> 04:14:44.720 align:start position:0%
information necessary in order to pass
 
04:14:46.990 --> 04:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
or fail an individual like he has that
 
04:14:49.389 --> 04:14:49.399 align:start position:0%
background information but again what
 
04:14:51.710 --> 04:14:51.720 align:start position:0%
stops that person from maybe leaking
 
04:14:53.630 --> 04:14:53.640 align:start position:0%
that information to others what I've
 
04:14:55.469 --> 04:14:55.479 align:start position:0%
noticed within the past of several years
 
04:14:56.870 --> 04:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
if you look at the New Hampshire fishing
 
04:14:59.269 --> 04:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
game guides list is there's actually a
 
04:15:01.670 --> 04:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
lot of very like family members that are
 
04:15:04.550 --> 04:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
all guides and it kind of interests me
 
04:15:07.030 --> 04:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
on how they are able to pass so easy
 
04:15:10.269 --> 04:15:10.279 align:start position:0%
easily versus others maybe not have that
 
04:15:10.279 --> 04:15:11.469 align:start position:0%
easily versus others maybe not have that
same

04:15:11.469 --> 04:15:11.479 align:start position:0%
same
 
04:15:13.309 --> 04:15:13.319 align:start position:0%
experience the other thing I want to
 
04:15:15.710 --> 04:15:15.720 align:start position:0%
bring up is also I have no problem with
 
04:15:17.990 --> 04:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
a test I think the information what
 
04:15:20.510 --> 04:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
we're tested on is totally fine it's
 
04:15:21.910 --> 04:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
accurate that's what we should be
 
04:15:24.229 --> 04:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
trained to do and
 
04:15:28.030 --> 04:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
whatnot but how it's administrated is
 
04:15:30.389 --> 04:15:30.399 align:start position:0%
one big problem there and as an educator
 
04:15:32.550 --> 04:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire one of the big things I
 
04:15:35.229 --> 04:15:35.239 align:start position:0%
teach my students and just always go by
 
04:15:37.670 --> 04:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
is to have a growth mindset and a growth
 
04:15:39.429 --> 04:15:39.439 align:start position:0%
mindset is where you can learn from your
 
04:15:41.870 --> 04:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
mistakes and in this case we don't have
 
04:15:44.670 --> 04:15:44.680 align:start position:0%
that opportunity we don't know why we
 
04:15:47.030 --> 04:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
failed and that is a big problem because
 
04:15:48.670 --> 04:15:48.680 align:start position:0%
I can go back and back to the study
 
04:15:50.790 --> 04:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
materials and still don't know why I
 
04:15:53.389 --> 04:15:53.399 align:start position:0%
failed and if by providing some sort of
 
04:15:55.630 --> 04:15:55.640 align:start position:0%
written report then I can understand all
 
04:15:57.469 --> 04:15:57.479 align:start position:0%
right why I failed and improv myself
 
04:16:00.109 --> 04:16:00.119 align:start position:0%
better for the next
 
04:16:03.229 --> 04:16:03.239 align:start position:0%
time and is also having that committee
 
04:16:05.750 --> 04:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
will help with that process of creating
 
04:16:07.790 --> 04:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
these exams making sure everything's
 
04:16:11.149 --> 04:16:11.159 align:start position:0%
fair and to go from
 
04:16:14.469 --> 04:16:14.479 align:start position:0%
there thank you are there any
 
04:16:16.670 --> 04:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
04:16:19.309 --> 04:16:19.319 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you the chair now
 
04:16:31.590 --> 04:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:33.469 --> 04:16:33.479 align:start position:0%
Burnham all right my name is Glenn
 
04:16:36.229 --> 04:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
Burnham residents of wolf Bor I run a
 
04:16:39.189 --> 04:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
construction out outfit um one of the
 
04:16:41.429 --> 04:16:41.439 align:start position:0%
questions related David P about the cost
 
04:16:43.149 --> 04:16:43.159 align:start position:0%
of this can you make sure you move into
 
04:16:45.109 --> 04:16:45.119 align:start position:0%
the mic sure thank you that's just there
 
04:16:47.830 --> 04:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
are people watching online as well and
 
04:16:50.349 --> 04:16:50.359 align:start position:0%
pick your voice up better thank you sir
 
04:16:54.590 --> 04:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
um the cpri cost we have to pay for
 
04:16:59.670 --> 04:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
routinely so that is a cost as well um
 
04:17:02.349 --> 04:17:02.359 align:start position:0%
as far as the transparency of this I
 
04:17:06.189 --> 04:17:06.199 align:start position:0%
find that um you know it should be you
 
04:17:08.229 --> 04:17:08.239 align:start position:0%
know if if you're answering a question
 
04:17:10.189 --> 04:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
there should be an answer for it you
 
04:17:13.149 --> 04:17:13.159 align:start position:0%
know and how do we know on these
 
04:17:16.429 --> 04:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
scenarios on this oral exam that there's
 
04:17:21.630 --> 04:17:21.640 align:start position:0%
not more scenarios being said to one
 
04:17:23.990 --> 04:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
candidate to another I mean if they
 
04:17:25.550 --> 04:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
failed on the first scenario then that
 
04:17:28.149 --> 04:17:28.159 align:start position:0%
should be brought up and why did you
 
04:17:31.710 --> 04:17:31.720 align:start position:0%
fail um you know I think it's a business
 
04:17:34.710 --> 04:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
they can say what they want about oh
 
04:17:36.070 --> 04:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
it's not a business I don't make a
 
04:17:39.189 --> 04:17:39.199 align:start position:0%
living out of it it is a business and
 
04:17:40.590 --> 04:17:40.600 align:start position:0%
one of the ladies over here said that
 
04:17:43.790 --> 04:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
her husband hired a guide my question to
 
04:17:47.070 --> 04:17:47.080 align:start position:0%
her is did you ask for proof of
 
04:17:49.149 --> 04:17:49.159 align:start position:0%
insurance that should be like the very
 
04:17:51.510 --> 04:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
first thing before you even step on the
 
04:17:54.790 --> 04:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
boat you don't even know if you're safe
 
04:17:57.790 --> 04:17:57.800 align:start position:0%
so regardless of this course if this guy
 
04:18:00.389 --> 04:18:00.399 align:start position:0%
has no insurance you have
 
04:18:04.429 --> 04:18:04.439 align:start position:0%
no you know nothing to claim on so I I
 
04:18:06.550 --> 04:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
think there's a lot of loopholes in this
 
04:18:06.560 --> 04:18:07.790 align:start position:0%
think there's a lot of loopholes in this
thing

04:18:07.790 --> 04:18:07.800 align:start position:0%
thing
 
04:18:11.590 --> 04:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
I think um I think the state has to step
 
04:18:13.910 --> 04:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
up and control it I don't like seeing a
 
04:18:17.030 --> 04:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
third party I I just I just think
 
04:18:20.550 --> 04:18:20.560 align:start position:0%
there's there's play for bad error
 
04:18:25.550 --> 04:18:25.560 align:start position:0%
here um also um on another note I was
 
04:18:27.189 --> 04:18:27.199 align:start position:0%
going to mention on he mentioned there
 
04:18:31.389 --> 04:18:31.399 align:start position:0%
was 150 to 200 guides in the state well
 
04:18:34.349 --> 04:18:34.359 align:start position:0%
how many of those guides took the test
 
04:18:35.910 --> 04:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
and how many of those guides were
 
04:18:38.030 --> 04:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
grandfathered in
 
04:18:40.149 --> 04:18:40.159 align:start position:0%
that's a question I'd like to ask David
 
04:18:42.830 --> 04:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
P you know so you talk about going out
 
04:18:45.269 --> 04:18:45.279 align:start position:0%
with these guides you don't even know if
 
04:18:47.670 --> 04:18:47.680 align:start position:0%
they even took the exam they've been
 
04:18:47.680 --> 04:18:49.750 align:start position:0%
they even took the exam they've been
grandfathered

04:18:49.750 --> 04:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
grandfathered
 
04:18:54.349 --> 04:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
in so and you talk about well you know
 
04:18:56.670 --> 04:18:56.680 align:start position:0%
it's so scary they need to have all this
 
04:18:56.680 --> 04:18:58.149 align:start position:0%
it's so scary they need to have all this
um

04:18:58.149 --> 04:18:58.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:01.349 --> 04:19:01.359 align:start position:0%
accreditation in my book I run a
 
04:19:03.990 --> 04:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
business I do bids for the Navy Yard I
 
04:19:05.389 --> 04:19:05.399 align:start position:0%
do bids for the biggest chips and
 
04:19:07.670 --> 04:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
wallboard plant in the
 
04:19:10.550 --> 04:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
State I run a
 
04:19:13.630 --> 04:19:13.640 align:start position:0%
risk it's a business that's exactly what
 
04:19:16.309 --> 04:19:16.319 align:start position:0%
it is if I had to make a a bid against
 
04:19:18.750 --> 04:19:18.760 align:start position:0%
another construction guy and I knew that
 
04:19:21.389 --> 04:19:21.399 align:start position:0%
he had something up over me well that's
 
04:19:23.870 --> 04:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
not fair that's like a pain company
 
04:19:27.469 --> 04:19:27.479 align:start position:0%
owning their own pain manufacturer you
 
04:19:29.189 --> 04:19:29.199 align:start position:0%
know apples for
 
04:19:32.710 --> 04:19:32.720 align:start position:0%
apples um so when you say yeah all these
 
04:19:35.870 --> 04:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
guides um are all qualified they're not
 
04:19:37.269 --> 04:19:37.279 align:start position:0%
all qualified
 
04:19:38.950 --> 04:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
there's a bunch of them out there that
 
04:19:40.189 --> 04:19:40.199 align:start position:0%
are grandfathered
 
04:19:42.990 --> 04:19:43.000 align:start position:0%
in so I don't know I just think you're
 
04:19:47.149 --> 04:19:47.159 align:start position:0%
taking a situation here and I you know
 
04:19:48.950 --> 04:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
we're making it bigger than what it
 
04:19:53.149 --> 04:19:53.159 align:start position:0%
is thank you are there any
 
04:19:55.189 --> 04:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you so much
 
04:19:57.590 --> 04:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
for your testimony today thank you sir
 
04:19:59.710 --> 04:19:59.720 align:start position:0%
and the last uh person I'll call is
 
04:20:03.349 --> 04:20:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:05.670 --> 04:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
game thank you Mr chair I'm sorry that
 
04:20:07.070 --> 04:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
we're running late I'm probably not
 
04:20:09.550 --> 04:20:09.560 align:start position:0%
going to speed that up much cuz there I
 
04:20:10.950 --> 04:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate that you might be able to
 
04:20:12.349 --> 04:20:12.359 align:start position:0%
answer a lot of the open ends yes
 
04:20:13.950 --> 04:20:13.960 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of uh information that's
 
04:20:15.630 --> 04:20:15.640 align:start position:0%
been provided that is not at all
 
04:20:17.670 --> 04:20:17.680 align:start position:0%
accurate so let me just tell you how
 
04:20:19.389 --> 04:20:19.399 align:start position:0%
this process works so for many many
 
04:20:21.990 --> 04:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
years uh fishing game provided a written
 
04:20:24.510 --> 04:20:24.520 align:start position:0%
exam for a guide it was the same written
 
04:20:26.990 --> 04:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
exam that was used better than a decade
 
04:20:29.109 --> 04:20:29.119 align:start position:0%
and so the exam became as you can all
 
04:20:31.030 --> 04:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
imagine very simple for everyone to pass
 
04:20:32.710 --> 04:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
and we had a number of people passing
 
04:20:34.469 --> 04:20:34.479 align:start position:0%
that that I questioned when I met them
 
04:20:36.469 --> 04:20:36.479 align:start position:0%
in the woods hunting that these are qual
 
04:20:38.149 --> 04:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
qualified people to take folks out and
 
04:20:39.590 --> 04:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
remember I want to remind you what's
 
04:20:41.990 --> 04:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
very most critical here we are taking
 
04:20:43.630 --> 04:20:43.640 align:start position:0%
people out into the Wilderness that
 
04:20:45.670 --> 04:20:45.680 align:start position:0%
don't have that experience they are
 
04:20:47.109 --> 04:20:47.119 align:start position:0%
relying on the people who are taking
 
04:20:48.590 --> 04:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
them out there to safely get them out
 
04:20:49.950 --> 04:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
there and return them home without
 
04:20:52.269 --> 04:20:52.279 align:start position:0%
injury that's a big deal that's a big
 
04:20:54.710 --> 04:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
deal to me that's a big deal to my staff
 
04:20:56.149 --> 04:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
and it's a big deal to the people that
 
04:20:58.389 --> 04:20:58.399 align:start position:0%
are going out there so it's very key I
 
04:21:01.229 --> 04:21:01.239 align:start position:0%
think that we improve that process so I
 
04:21:03.389 --> 04:21:03.399 align:start position:0%
went to the guides Association I was the
 
04:21:05.349 --> 04:21:05.359 align:start position:0%
guy who did that I went to the guides
 
04:21:07.070 --> 04:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
Association CU those are the guys or
 
04:21:08.750 --> 04:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
people not just guys those are the
 
04:21:11.309 --> 04:21:11.319 align:start position:0%
people that are doing it um I look back
 
04:21:13.590 --> 04:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
at Marty because she lectures me on on
 
04:21:16.550 --> 04:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
coming into the 2000s and I'm trying
 
04:21:20.309 --> 04:21:20.319 align:start position:0%
very hard to do that I'm a dinosaur so
 
04:21:22.510 --> 04:21:22.520 align:start position:0%
the guides I we looked at other states
 
04:21:24.229 --> 04:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
so we looked at the state of main who I
 
04:21:25.830 --> 04:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
thought got it right the one thing the
 
04:21:27.950 --> 04:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
state of main does is they manage their
 
04:21:29.710 --> 04:21:29.720 align:start position:0%
guides a lot tighter than we do they
 
04:21:31.550 --> 04:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
even get into what they charge and how
 
04:21:33.750 --> 04:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
much they can charge I'm not looking to
 
04:21:35.229 --> 04:21:35.239 align:start position:0%
do that as Free Enterprise in the state
 
04:21:37.149 --> 04:21:37.159 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and and it's none of my
 
04:21:39.630 --> 04:21:39.640 align:start position:0%
business but I did like their testing
 
04:21:41.229 --> 04:21:41.239 align:start position:0%
procedure I thought that their testing
 
04:21:44.469 --> 04:21:44.479 align:start position:0%
procedure was was a good measure of
 
04:21:46.790 --> 04:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
skill sets and their testing procedure
 
04:21:48.630 --> 04:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
is similar to ours so we kind of
 
04:21:51.469 --> 04:21:51.479 align:start position:0%
mirrored that so what happens now when
 
04:21:52.830 --> 04:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
you have someone who applies for a
 
04:21:55.109 --> 04:21:55.119 align:start position:0%
guides license they have to have a CPR
 
04:21:57.030 --> 04:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
certification or at least Wilderness
 
04:21:58.429 --> 04:21:58.439 align:start position:0%
first aid because we want them to be
 
04:22:00.550 --> 04:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
able to perform CPR and first aid on
 
04:22:02.870 --> 04:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
injured uh people which by the way
 
04:22:05.910 --> 04:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
happens a lot these people get injured a
 
04:22:07.550 --> 04:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
lot they have diabetic shocks when
 
04:22:09.269 --> 04:22:09.279 align:start position:0%
they're out there's all kinds of issues
 
04:22:11.189 --> 04:22:11.199 align:start position:0%
that come up so to ask the guides to at
 
04:22:13.469 --> 04:22:13.479 align:start position:0%
least be trained to that level uh is
 
04:22:15.389 --> 04:22:15.399 align:start position:0%
appropriate they submit all that
 
04:22:17.990 --> 04:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
paperwork we do a background check which
 
04:22:19.070 --> 04:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
is another bill that you're going to
 
04:22:21.189 --> 04:22:21.199 align:start position:0%
hear about later uh in an effort to
 
04:22:22.950 --> 04:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
tighten up uh because we've had some
 
04:22:24.349 --> 04:22:24.359 align:start position:0%
issues with that and I don't know if you
 
04:22:26.510 --> 04:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
remember but we had a guide or an issue
 
04:22:28.030 --> 04:22:28.040 align:start position:0%
come before this very committee a number
 
04:22:30.389 --> 04:22:30.399 align:start position:0%
of years ago where a sex offender had
 
04:22:32.269 --> 04:22:32.279 align:start position:0%
snuck under the wire became a guide and
 
04:22:34.070 --> 04:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
was offending children in the Bob house
 
04:22:35.870 --> 04:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
and we dealt with that yeah that came
 
04:22:37.550 --> 04:22:37.560 align:start position:0%
here so So you you're going to hear that
 
04:22:39.469 --> 04:22:39.479 align:start position:0%
again at a Senate bill that's coming
 
04:22:42.149 --> 04:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
towards you for to try and prevent that
 
04:22:44.030 --> 04:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
so they submit all that paperwork within
 
04:22:45.950 --> 04:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
a window of time we put on the website
 
04:22:47.630 --> 04:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
what that window of time is so it's very
 
04:22:49.670 --> 04:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
clear to everyone that comes into my
 
04:22:51.510 --> 04:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
office at law enforcement and the young
 
04:22:53.349 --> 04:22:53.359 align:start position:0%
lady in their schedules a written exam
 
04:22:56.070 --> 04:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
in which I take part in so I go down
 
04:22:57.790 --> 04:22:57.800 align:start position:0%
when we score the exam and I take in
 
04:23:00.550 --> 04:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
each and so we we change the exam I
 
04:23:02.429 --> 04:23:02.439 align:start position:0%
asked the officers not the guides
 
04:23:05.070 --> 04:23:05.080 align:start position:0%
Association the officers to create
 
04:23:07.269 --> 04:23:07.279 align:start position:0%
questions that we could put in a bank I
 
04:23:09.670 --> 04:23:09.680 align:start position:0%
had our it people create a bank of
 
04:23:11.510 --> 04:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
questions for hunting a bank of
 
04:23:13.469 --> 04:23:13.479 align:start position:0%
questions for fishing and we basically
 
04:23:15.149 --> 04:23:15.159 align:start position:0%
go to this bank and say okay
 
04:23:16.309 --> 04:23:16.319 align:start position:0%
representative goalie wants to take a
 
04:23:18.189 --> 04:23:18.199 align:start position:0%
hunting exam so we'll pull out a hunting
 
04:23:20.670 --> 04:23:20.680 align:start position:0%
exam which will have a number of
 
04:23:23.030 --> 04:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
questions on it I can go back 5 seconds
 
04:23:24.750 --> 04:23:24.760 align:start position:0%
later and ask for one for representative
 
04:23:26.590 --> 04:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
Spain and it'll be very different it
 
04:23:27.910 --> 04:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
will have hunting questions on it but
 
04:23:29.550 --> 04:23:29.560 align:start position:0%
they will be different questions we're
 
04:23:32.510 --> 04:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
very happy with that on occasion the
 
04:23:34.070 --> 04:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
hunting exam will produce a fishing
 
04:23:36.070 --> 04:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
question or the fishing exam will Pro
 
04:23:37.469 --> 04:23:37.479 align:start position:0%
prod produce a hunting question as you
 
04:23:40.790 --> 04:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
heard um and I forget um the gentleman's
 
04:23:43.870 --> 04:23:43.880 align:start position:0%
name who who that occurred with Jody
 
04:23:47.109 --> 04:23:47.119 align:start position:0%
Jody so the one thing jod didn't maybe
 
04:23:48.630 --> 04:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
didn't understand or certainly it wasn't
 
04:23:50.229 --> 04:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
communicated we don't score those
 
04:23:52.349 --> 04:23:52.359 align:start position:0%
questions against their final score so
 
04:23:53.790 --> 04:23:53.800 align:start position:0%
if I've got a gentleman in there taking
 
04:23:55.149 --> 04:23:55.159 align:start position:0%
a fishing exam and there are hunting
 
04:23:57.309 --> 04:23:57.319 align:start position:0%
questions in there that he missed we go
 
04:23:59.469 --> 04:23:59.479 align:start position:0%
over it I tell him you missed the bass
 
04:24:01.469 --> 04:24:01.479 align:start position:0%
question on your hunting exam but it
 
04:24:03.229 --> 04:24:03.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't count towards his final score
 
04:24:05.229 --> 04:24:05.239 align:start position:0%
because it's an incorrect question so
 
04:24:07.349 --> 04:24:07.359 align:start position:0%
that is corrected he's right we do jump
 
04:24:09.349 --> 04:24:09.359 align:start position:0%
on that but I think it's important to
 
04:24:10.590 --> 04:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
understand that it doesn't count against
 
04:24:13.590 --> 04:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
our score on that day if they in fact
 
04:24:15.109 --> 04:24:15.119 align:start position:0%
pass that written exam we give them a
 
04:24:16.790 --> 04:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
schedule for the next oral board exam
 
04:24:19.309 --> 04:24:19.319 align:start position:0%
now the oral board exam is a very uh
 
04:24:22.830 --> 04:24:22.840 align:start position:0%
involved test the officers get together
 
04:24:24.550 --> 04:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
the guides Association comes in on their
 
04:24:26.109 --> 04:24:26.119 align:start position:0%
own time volunteering their own time to
 
04:24:28.030 --> 04:24:28.040 align:start position:0%
help us with this and we create an oral
 
04:24:30.030 --> 04:24:30.040 align:start position:0%
board exam that we're going to give a
 
04:24:32.630 --> 04:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
number of people we schedule four maybe
 
04:24:35.149 --> 04:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
five a day at best because it takes some
 
04:24:36.670 --> 04:24:36.680 align:start position:0%
time to go through this they're done in
 
04:24:39.389 --> 04:24:39.399 align:start position:0%
two sections so normally there's and I
 
04:24:41.710 --> 04:24:41.720 align:start position:0%
used to be a part of this for many years
 
04:24:43.429 --> 04:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
it was done in three sections now it's
 
04:24:45.870 --> 04:24:45.880 align:start position:0%
been changed to two uh but they do a
 
04:24:48.429 --> 04:24:48.439 align:start position:0%
navigational piece be it on the water or
 
04:24:51.710 --> 04:24:51.720 align:start position:0%
on land um because navigation of course
 
04:24:53.790 --> 04:24:53.800 align:start position:0%
could is part of why we do search and
 
04:24:56.710 --> 04:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
rescue is people are not good at that uh
 
04:24:58.429 --> 04:24:58.439 align:start position:0%
so there's a navigational section and we
 
04:25:00.429 --> 04:25:00.439 align:start position:0%
ask them to step out once we put them
 
04:25:02.189 --> 04:25:02.199 align:start position:0%
through that exam and that exam is
 
04:25:04.070 --> 04:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
scored and then they're brought back in
 
04:25:06.630 --> 04:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
and they're told then that they failed
 
04:25:08.990 --> 04:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
or passed that section if they pass that
 
04:25:10.750 --> 04:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
section they move on to the next one
 
04:25:13.189 --> 04:25:13.199 align:start position:0%
which would be the search and rescue
 
04:25:15.189 --> 04:25:15.199 align:start position:0%
piece of it or the first aid piece of it
 
04:25:17.670 --> 04:25:17.680 align:start position:0%
are the general guiding type scenarios
 
04:25:19.389 --> 04:25:19.399 align:start position:0%
we may have some objects in the room we
 
04:25:21.229 --> 04:25:21.239 align:start position:0%
want them to identify I like to see them
 
04:25:23.030 --> 04:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
pick up a firearm make sure they don't
 
04:25:25.109 --> 04:25:25.119 align:start position:0%
swing it around and point it at us that
 
04:25:26.469 --> 04:25:26.479 align:start position:0%
they check to make sure it's empty I
 
04:25:27.710 --> 04:25:27.720 align:start position:0%
mean we go through the whole just like
 
04:25:29.870 --> 04:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
you did in Hunter Hunter Safety years
 
04:25:33.309 --> 04:25:33.319 align:start position:0%
ago if they fail those sections we used
 
04:25:35.550 --> 04:25:35.560 align:start position:0%
to tell them okay you failed map and
 
04:25:36.990 --> 04:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
compass because you couldn't Orient your
 
04:25:38.510 --> 04:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
map in your compass and this is how you
 
04:25:40.189 --> 04:25:40.199 align:start position:0%
Orient your map in a compass the problem
 
04:25:42.830 --> 04:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
with that was now we're just training to
 
04:25:45.309 --> 04:25:45.319 align:start position:0%
the test everybody that came in we had
 
04:25:46.910 --> 04:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
people coming in answering questions
 
04:25:49.229 --> 04:25:49.239 align:start position:0%
before we could completely ask them
 
04:25:50.990 --> 04:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
that's how educated they had become to
 
04:25:52.910 --> 04:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
this one thing that hasn't been
 
04:25:54.510 --> 04:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned at all today is New Hampshire
 
04:25:57.550 --> 04:25:57.560 align:start position:0%
has a very good guide school that trains
 
04:25:59.070 --> 04:25:59.080 align:start position:0%
these individuals to get through this
 
04:26:02.189 --> 04:26:02.199 align:start position:0%
exam that's what they do it's not cheap
 
04:26:04.030 --> 04:26:04.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's an expensive School I've never
 
04:26:05.510 --> 04:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
been there but I know the instructor
 
04:26:07.309 --> 04:26:07.319 align:start position:0%
I've talked to on numerous occasions the
 
04:26:10.269 --> 04:26:10.279 align:start position:0%
man who manages it and we provide that
 
04:26:11.870 --> 04:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
information to these people when they
 
04:26:13.710 --> 04:26:13.720 align:start position:0%
fail so we'll say to someone when you
 
04:26:16.189 --> 04:26:16.199 align:start position:0%
fail the navigation when you come back
 
04:26:18.189 --> 04:26:18.199 align:start position:0%
in you need to strengthen your skills in
 
04:26:19.590 --> 04:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
navigation I'm not going to tell them
 
04:26:21.109 --> 04:26:21.119 align:start position:0%
you need to understand how to go from
 
04:26:23.670 --> 04:26:23.680 align:start position:0%
point A to point B that's on them to
 
04:26:26.429 --> 04:26:26.439 align:start position:0%
understand that I expect adults to take
 
04:26:28.550 --> 04:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
that responsibility on their own I was
 
04:26:30.870 --> 04:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
not told in the oral board uh when I
 
04:26:32.830 --> 04:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
went to my first oral board for this job
 
04:26:34.510 --> 04:26:34.520 align:start position:0%
and I knew nothing about the Sea Coast I
 
04:26:35.990 --> 04:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
was not told I failed because I could
 
04:26:38.149 --> 04:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
couldn't identify a clam I was told you
 
04:26:39.269 --> 04:26:39.279 align:start position:0%
fail because you don't know anything
 
04:26:41.189 --> 04:26:41.199 align:start position:0%
about the coast dummy go back and learn
 
04:26:42.750 --> 04:26:42.760 align:start position:0%
the coast and you can com and I got
 
04:26:45.269 --> 04:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
through the the exam I I think it's a
 
04:26:47.109 --> 04:26:47.119 align:start position:0%
mistake to tell them exactly why they
 
04:26:49.109 --> 04:26:49.119 align:start position:0%
failed I don't think it's a mistake to
 
04:26:50.950 --> 04:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
say you failed
 
04:26:53.269 --> 04:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
navigation here are some resources we'll
 
04:26:55.030 --> 04:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
give you to Bone up on your navigation
 
04:26:56.990 --> 04:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
we give them uh a gentleman who teaches
 
04:26:59.590 --> 04:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
map and Compass teaches it to my staff
 
04:27:01.269 --> 04:27:01.279 align:start position:0%
we give them the guide school resource
 
04:27:02.950 --> 04:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
list to say that we don't provide them
 
04:27:05.670 --> 04:27:05.680 align:start position:0%
with that information is incorrect we do
 
04:27:07.349 --> 04:27:07.359 align:start position:0%
whether they take advantage of it or not
 
04:27:09.830 --> 04:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
is another thing that's up to them we do
 
04:27:12.030 --> 04:27:12.040 align:start position:0%
allow them to retest unlike the state of
 
04:27:13.790 --> 04:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
Maine we don't charge them for that we
 
04:27:15.870 --> 04:27:15.880 align:start position:0%
don't charge for any of the testing our
 
04:27:18.349 --> 04:27:18.359 align:start position:0%
charge is the $100 fee for the
 
04:27:21.070 --> 04:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
license that that money is returned to
 
04:27:23.189 --> 04:27:23.199 align:start position:0%
them if they fail the exam that we don't
 
04:27:24.550 --> 04:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
take that money until they buy the
 
04:27:26.670 --> 04:27:26.680 align:start position:0%
license so they can take that exam 14
 
04:27:28.229 --> 04:27:28.239 align:start position:0%
times they're not going to pay any any
 
04:27:31.189 --> 04:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
additional money um what did happen in
 
04:27:33.790 --> 04:27:33.800 align:start position:0%
the beginning because this test was a
 
04:27:35.510 --> 04:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
huge step in the very beginning as you
 
04:27:36.910 --> 04:27:36.920 align:start position:0%
can imagine inagine we had a high
 
04:27:39.389 --> 04:27:39.399 align:start position:0%
failure rate uh a number of people
 
04:27:42.550 --> 04:27:42.560 align:start position:0%
failed and so we began to offer them the
 
04:27:44.950 --> 04:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
next round of oral boards to retake that
 
04:27:46.830 --> 04:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
exam and what was happening is we had so
 
04:27:48.870 --> 04:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
many failures in the beginning we were
 
04:27:51.309 --> 04:27:51.319 align:start position:0%
not getting any new people I was pushing
 
04:27:53.510 --> 04:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
new people off 6 to8 months because we
 
04:27:54.710 --> 04:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
were still trying to get the people
 
04:27:56.309 --> 04:27:56.319 align:start position:0%
through who couldn't pass it the first
 
04:27:58.630 --> 04:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
three times and so quickly we figured
 
04:28:00.109 --> 04:28:00.119 align:start position:0%
out we got to do something different
 
04:28:02.550 --> 04:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
let's allow them to take it twice and
 
04:28:04.429 --> 04:28:04.439 align:start position:0%
then let the then this way we'd be able
 
04:28:06.469 --> 04:28:06.479 align:start position:0%
to keep our line moving forward the new
 
04:28:08.070 --> 04:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
people who could pass could come in and
 
04:28:09.389 --> 04:28:09.399 align:start position:0%
get their opportunity and the people who
 
04:28:11.389 --> 04:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
fail could come back they are allowed to
 
04:28:12.910 --> 04:28:12.920 align:start position:0%
come back within a month and take that
 
04:28:15.349 --> 04:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
test again if they fail a second time
 
04:28:16.990 --> 04:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
then we make them wait a year and that's
 
04:28:20.229 --> 04:28:20.239 align:start position:0%
on our that's uh publicly shared we tell
 
04:28:21.910 --> 04:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
them that at every step of the way so
 
04:28:23.269 --> 04:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
that they understand if they fail that
 
04:28:25.510 --> 04:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
test again that they they they have to
 
04:28:27.149 --> 04:28:27.159 align:start position:0%
wait a year before they can retest and
 
04:28:29.149 --> 04:28:29.159 align:start position:0%
that's the reason for that is we want to
 
04:28:32.590 --> 04:28:32.600 align:start position:0%
move it forward I would like I truly
 
04:28:34.429 --> 04:28:34.439 align:start position:0%
would like to have enough officers so I
 
04:28:36.349 --> 04:28:36.359 align:start position:0%
could dedicate five of them to this
 
04:28:38.269 --> 04:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
process alone unfortunately with all the
 
04:28:39.870 --> 04:28:39.880 align:start position:0%
things that we got going on on a
 
04:28:41.550 --> 04:28:41.560 align:start position:0%
day-to-day basis I just don't have the
 
04:28:44.109 --> 04:28:44.119 align:start position:0%
staff for that we have two people doing
 
04:28:45.630 --> 04:28:45.640 align:start position:0%
they keep talking about the
 
04:28:47.670 --> 04:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
commission the commission has nothing to
 
04:28:50.070 --> 04:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
do with this our Fishing Game Commission
 
04:28:52.950 --> 04:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
does policy they manage the agency from
 
04:28:55.349 --> 04:28:55.359 align:start position:0%
the 60,000 foot view if you will they
 
04:28:57.349 --> 04:28:57.359 align:start position:0%
manage the direction of the agency the
 
04:29:00.229 --> 04:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
legislative process they do not assign
 
04:29:03.030 --> 04:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
staff to anything the director does that
 
04:29:05.469 --> 04:29:05.479 align:start position:0%
or his designate does that so the the
 
04:29:08.030 --> 04:29:08.040 align:start position:0%
guy committee or the committee that
 
04:29:09.830 --> 04:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
makes this decision the oral board is
 
04:29:11.790 --> 04:29:11.800 align:start position:0%
the oral board itself it's not a single
 
04:29:13.590 --> 04:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
person it's the oral board who tests the
 
04:29:15.149 --> 04:29:15.159 align:start position:0%
director I don't think the director's
 
04:29:18.309 --> 04:29:18.319 align:start position:0%
ever been to a test he he we advise him
 
04:29:19.950 --> 04:29:19.960 align:start position:0%
on where we're going and how many have
 
04:29:24.189 --> 04:29:24.199 align:start position:0%
passed and and what stage we're in um so
 
04:29:26.590 --> 04:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
it's it's a number of but it takes guys
 
04:29:28.030 --> 04:29:28.040 align:start position:0%
have got to get together they've got to
 
04:29:29.870 --> 04:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
line up their schedule so they commit a
 
04:29:31.990 --> 04:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
full day with no calls for service they
 
04:29:33.229 --> 04:29:33.239 align:start position:0%
can't respond to any call because
 
04:29:35.189 --> 04:29:35.199 align:start position:0%
they're committed to this exam and so
 
04:29:37.830 --> 04:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
then that exam exam is provided again
 
04:29:39.550 --> 04:29:39.560 align:start position:0%
these they have a number of tests they
 
04:29:41.590 --> 04:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
keep rotating these and to answer your
 
04:29:43.189 --> 04:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
question which was a great questions who
 
04:29:44.910 --> 04:29:44.920 align:start position:0%
comes up with the questions for this in
 
04:29:46.790 --> 04:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
the oral board It's a combination of the
 
04:29:49.429 --> 04:29:49.439 align:start position:0%
officers and the guides Association that
 
04:29:51.950 --> 04:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
will create scenarios and questions that
 
04:29:51.960 --> 04:29:52.750 align:start position:0%
will create scenarios and questions that
are

04:29:52.750 --> 04:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:29:55.429 --> 04:29:55.439 align:start position:0%
provided um and and the other argument
 
04:29:57.630 --> 04:29:57.640 align:start position:0%
that I I couldn't disagree with more is
 
04:29:59.710 --> 04:29:59.720 align:start position:0%
the fact that the feeling or the belief
 
04:30:01.670 --> 04:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
that the guides Association is a
 
04:30:04.149 --> 04:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
conflict Dave pointed out David P
 
04:30:06.149 --> 04:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
pointed out that the electrician board
 
04:30:07.790 --> 04:30:07.800 align:start position:0%
has electricians on it the no Hampshire
 
04:30:09.910 --> 04:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
bar has attorneys on it the medical
 
04:30:12.910 --> 04:30:12.920 align:start position:0%
board is medical doctors nursing board
 
04:30:15.510 --> 04:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
is Nurses I could go on all day it it
 
04:30:17.790 --> 04:30:17.800 align:start position:0%
just makes sense to have people that do
 
04:30:20.189 --> 04:30:20.199 align:start position:0%
this for a living decide whether others
 
04:30:23.189 --> 04:30:23.199 align:start position:0%
are fit to do it or not uh if you file a
 
04:30:24.870 --> 04:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
complaint on a defense attorney which
 
04:30:27.149 --> 04:30:27.159 align:start position:0%
I've done it goes to a bunch a board of
 
04:30:29.109 --> 04:30:29.119 align:start position:0%
attorneys to review and decide if the
 
04:30:31.389 --> 04:30:31.399 align:start position:0%
attorney made a mistake or not it's it's
 
04:30:32.750 --> 04:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
just the way things are done and it
 
04:30:34.950 --> 04:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
makes good sense to do that we do not
 
04:30:37.109 --> 04:30:37.119 align:start position:0%
have enough guys guides there's no
 
04:30:40.030 --> 04:30:40.040 align:start position:0%
shortage of uh we don't have an there's
 
04:30:43.830 --> 04:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
no there's no reason for a guide the GU
 
04:30:45.349 --> 04:30:45.359 align:start position:0%
any member of the guide Association to
 
04:30:46.870 --> 04:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
not want more people doing this cuz
 
04:30:48.990 --> 04:30:49.000 align:start position:0%
there just isn't isn't enough guides to
 
04:30:50.389 --> 04:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
go around the state we're getting more
 
04:30:52.950 --> 04:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
and more calls every day for that so the
 
04:30:55.189 --> 04:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
thought of of eliminating them and
 
04:30:56.990 --> 04:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
having my officer sitting there silently
 
04:30:58.309 --> 04:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
while a guide says well I don't want
 
04:30:59.670 --> 04:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
another guide so I'm going to cut this
 
04:31:01.469 --> 04:31:01.479 align:start position:0%
guy out is ludicrous that just doesn't
 
04:31:03.070 --> 04:31:03.080 align:start position:0%
happen and it never would happen under
 
04:31:04.670 --> 04:31:04.680 align:start position:0%
that scenario so it's not a decision
 
04:31:07.910 --> 04:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
that falls solely to the guides
 
04:31:10.590 --> 04:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
um I've managed not to follow a single
 
04:31:12.510 --> 04:31:12.520 align:start position:0%
word of my outline so I would like to
 
04:31:14.910 --> 04:31:14.920 align:start position:0%
make sure which is typical you can
 
04:31:16.469 --> 04:31:16.479 align:start position:0%
submit that if you'd like to submit that
 
04:31:18.429 --> 04:31:18.439 align:start position:0%
to the clerk I just want to make sure I
 
04:31:20.229 --> 04:31:20.239 align:start position:0%
hit on all the points no that's great we
 
04:31:21.670 --> 04:31:21.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate in the interest of time that
 
04:31:23.189 --> 04:31:23.199 align:start position:0%
you don't read through everything no no
 
04:31:25.950 --> 04:31:25.960 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't do that
 
04:31:28.790 --> 04:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
um so I guess at this point I I would
 
04:31:31.309 --> 04:31:31.319 align:start position:0%
ask you not to change it I think it I
 
04:31:32.830 --> 04:31:32.840 align:start position:0%
personally think it is going in the
 
04:31:34.990 --> 04:31:35.000 align:start position:0%
right direction I feel bad for people
 
04:31:37.030 --> 04:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
that can't pass it but we can't tell
 
04:31:38.870 --> 04:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
them what they need to do to pass I
 
04:31:40.830 --> 04:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
can't teach the test I'd rather have
 
04:31:42.510 --> 04:31:42.520 align:start position:0%
them skilled in the in what they're
 
04:31:44.830 --> 04:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
going to do that's more important to
 
04:31:46.870 --> 04:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
have them go back and study an area that
 
04:31:48.590 --> 04:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
they're weak in to to improve in that
 
04:31:51.670 --> 04:31:51.680 align:start position:0%
and pass the test so I I by no means we
 
04:31:53.750 --> 04:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
insulting anyone and I don't I we're not
 
04:31:55.229 --> 04:31:55.239 align:start position:0%
in the business of not making them
 
04:31:57.309 --> 04:31:57.319 align:start position:0%
guides I just want to make sure uh that
 
04:31:59.030 --> 04:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
when we turn them out they are they are
 
04:32:00.309 --> 04:32:00.319 align:start position:0%
qualified and the last thing I want to
 
04:32:02.510 --> 04:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
leave you with I've done this for 33
 
04:32:04.510 --> 04:32:04.520 align:start position:0%
years a long time I know it's stupid but
 
04:32:08.670 --> 04:32:08.680 align:start position:0%
I have we have never ever in the history
 
04:32:10.510 --> 04:32:10.520 align:start position:0%
of my involvement at New Hampshire
 
04:32:12.389 --> 04:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
fishing game ever conducted a search and
 
04:32:14.630 --> 04:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
rescue mission involving a guided hunt
 
04:32:16.990 --> 04:32:17.000 align:start position:0%
or a guided fishing trip that says
 
04:32:19.269 --> 04:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
something I have been involved in two
 
04:32:20.910 --> 04:32:20.920 align:start position:0%
fatalities in the state of Vermont that
 
04:32:23.070 --> 04:32:23.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't regulate guides that involve
 
04:32:25.349 --> 04:32:25.359 align:start position:0%
guided fishing trips to individuals who
 
04:32:27.990 --> 04:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
drown so if you think for a minute it's
 
04:32:30.149 --> 04:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
not important it is important it happens
 
04:32:31.750 --> 04:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
in other states that don't regulate it
 
04:32:33.510 --> 04:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
they have a hard time with it in Maine
 
04:32:34.950 --> 04:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire we don't because I
 
04:32:36.790 --> 04:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
think I think it's because we regulate
 
04:32:38.030 --> 04:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
it we make sure these people are
 
04:32:39.750 --> 04:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
competent before we turn them loose to
 
04:32:41.109 --> 04:32:41.119 align:start position:0%
bring people out and we want to make
 
04:32:43.070 --> 04:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
sure that they bring them back I think
 
04:32:44.510 --> 04:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
that's an important point Thank You
 
04:32:46.950 --> 04:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
Colonel appreciate your testimony uh
 
04:32:48.389 --> 04:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
before I open it up for questions for
 
04:32:50.510 --> 04:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
everyone I've got an ask of you and I I
 
04:32:52.030 --> 04:32:52.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate the balance between not
 
04:32:53.349 --> 04:32:53.359 align:start position:0%
having enough guides in the state and
 
04:32:54.630 --> 04:32:54.640 align:start position:0%
wanting to keep people interested in
 
04:32:56.910 --> 04:32:56.920 align:start position:0%
applying yes but I would ask that your
 
04:32:58.870 --> 04:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
department get us information what it
 
04:33:00.870 --> 04:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
costs you to run the guide testing every
 
04:33:02.550 --> 04:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
year since you're not charging anything
 
04:33:04.750 --> 04:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
for it I think that might be a situation
 
04:33:06.230 --> 04:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
where we've got to drain on the budget
 
04:33:08.150 --> 04:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
that should not be there yeah I can do
 
04:33:10.349 --> 04:33:10.359 align:start position:0%
um and I will now allow the uh Vice
 
04:33:13.670 --> 04:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
chair to ask his question thank you Mr
 
04:33:15.310 --> 04:33:15.320 align:start position:0%
chair thank you Colonel for taking my
 
04:33:15.320 --> 04:33:16.830 align:start position:0%
chair thank you Colonel for taking my
question

04:33:16.830 --> 04:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:33:18.990 --> 04:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
uh looking at the
 
04:33:22.070 --> 04:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
oral I'm sure it's probably something
 
04:33:23.949 --> 04:33:23.959 align:start position:0%
similar to the fire service that I'm
 
04:33:25.789 --> 04:33:25.799 align:start position:0%
familiar with where you're given a
 
04:33:28.510 --> 04:33:28.520 align:start position:0%
scenario a real life scenario something
 
04:33:31.510 --> 04:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
happening yes and in that scenario you
 
04:33:34.029 --> 04:33:34.039 align:start position:0%
have a checklist of those critical
 
04:33:36.510 --> 04:33:36.520 align:start position:0%
criteria Maybe five things you missed
 
04:33:38.189 --> 04:33:38.199 align:start position:0%
one of those five things it isn't just
 
04:33:41.269 --> 04:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
10 points off you fail that completely
 
04:33:42.789 --> 04:33:42.799 align:start position:0%
because that's a critical criteria
 
04:33:44.470 --> 04:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely that's exactly how it's go
 
04:33:45.709 --> 04:33:45.719 align:start position:0%
down the list and there's somewh you
 
04:33:47.189 --> 04:33:47.199 align:start position:0%
minus five points because yougot
 
04:33:48.949 --> 04:33:48.959 align:start position:0%
something corre is that how I understand
 
04:33:50.869 --> 04:33:50.879 align:start position:0%
this it is how it's done and I think
 
04:33:52.349 --> 04:33:52.359 align:start position:0%
that's where the confusion comes in that
 
04:33:55.109 --> 04:33:55.119 align:start position:0%
one question can fail you for instance a
 
04:33:58.269 --> 04:33:58.279 align:start position:0%
your client has goes into diabetic shock
 
04:33:59.869 --> 04:33:59.879 align:start position:0%
what would you do with that client and
 
04:34:01.470 --> 04:34:01.480 align:start position:0%
if you do the wrong thing you could kill
 
04:34:03.349 --> 04:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
that client and that's a critical
 
04:34:06.429 --> 04:34:06.439 align:start position:0%
question um so yes that's exactly how
 
04:34:08.670 --> 04:34:08.680 align:start position:0%
it's done is is there's a series of
 
04:34:10.470 --> 04:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
steps that we're looking for and I will
 
04:34:13.470 --> 04:34:13.480 align:start position:0%
say this it is very open-ended in that
 
04:34:15.990 --> 04:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
it isn't a a there's not as you know
 
04:34:18.629 --> 04:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
there's not in any emergency situation
 
04:34:20.070 --> 04:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
there are things we would all like to
 
04:34:21.990 --> 04:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
see done that doesn't mean there isn't
 
04:34:23.789 --> 04:34:23.799 align:start position:0%
an idea out there we hadn't thought of
 
04:34:25.269 --> 04:34:25.279 align:start position:0%
that would work and every now and then
 
04:34:27.310 --> 04:34:27.320 align:start position:0%
they get thrown that curve and we accept
 
04:34:29.150 --> 04:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
that that's not it doesn't have to be in
 
04:34:31.390 --> 04:34:31.400 align:start position:0%
writing like we've got it as long as the
 
04:34:33.269 --> 04:34:33.279 align:start position:0%
results are achieved and the client is
 
04:34:35.070 --> 04:34:35.080 align:start position:0%
safe and you've done everything in your
 
04:34:38.629 --> 04:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
power to ensure that um that is how we
 
04:34:41.429 --> 04:34:41.439 align:start position:0%
do it that's exactly how we do it
 
04:34:43.990 --> 04:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney thank you Mr chair
 
04:34:45.150 --> 04:34:45.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and all the
 
04:34:49.109 --> 04:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
information do you publish previously
 
04:34:52.429 --> 04:34:52.439 align:start position:0%
asked or retired questions and scenarios
 
04:34:55.189 --> 04:34:55.199 align:start position:0%
for the applicants thank you we've never
 
04:34:58.269 --> 04:34:58.279 align:start position:0%
published the test uh a test would be
 
04:35:00.750 --> 04:35:00.760 align:start position:0%
exempt I believe from right to know I'd
 
04:35:02.429 --> 04:35:02.439 align:start position:0%
have to look at that but I think test
 
04:35:04.869 --> 04:35:04.879 align:start position:0%
and results of test are exempt from that
 
04:35:08.590 --> 04:35:08.600 align:start position:0%
in effort to protect the the
 
04:35:11.230 --> 04:35:11.240 align:start position:0%
um uh the the what's the word I'm
 
04:35:13.390 --> 04:35:13.400 align:start position:0%
looking for the protesting to protect
 
04:35:15.990 --> 04:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
the Integrity of the test so no we don't
 
04:35:19.029 --> 04:35:19.039 align:start position:0%
we don't publicly publish that no we do
 
04:35:20.629 --> 04:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
put out a lot of information on the
 
04:35:23.709 --> 04:35:23.719 align:start position:0%
website regarding what areas you should
 
04:35:25.869 --> 04:35:25.879 align:start position:0%
be knowledgeable in and where to find
 
04:35:28.590 --> 04:35:28.600 align:start position:0%
resources to study for that follow up
 
04:35:30.349 --> 04:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
just very quickly I understand not
 
04:35:32.869 --> 04:35:32.879 align:start position:0%
publishing the test but previously
 
04:35:36.551 --> 04:35:36.561 align:start position:0%
retired questions that w or sample
 
04:35:38.670 --> 04:35:38.680 align:start position:0%
scenarios that you wouldn't ask on the
 
04:35:41.029 --> 04:35:41.039 align:start position:0%
actual exam no we haven't done that
 
04:35:43.269 --> 04:35:43.279 align:start position:0%
that's that's not a bad idea to do on
 
04:35:45.109 --> 04:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
retired ones that we've done if we have
 
04:35:46.830 --> 04:35:46.840 align:start position:0%
those Banks most professions that you
 
04:35:49.230 --> 04:35:49.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned in your list do do that thank
 
04:35:51.551 --> 04:35:51.561 align:start position:0%
you yep thank you that's a good question
 
04:35:53.070 --> 04:35:53.080 align:start position:0%
and uh representative
 
04:35:55.269 --> 04:35:55.279 align:start position:0%
Ford thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:35:57.910 --> 04:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
Colonel for my question um always enjoy
 
04:36:01.670 --> 04:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
your honesty um one of the former folks
 
04:36:03.310 --> 04:36:03.320 align:start position:0%
who gave their testimony said they were
 
04:36:05.150 --> 04:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
educator and I realized I too am an ed
 
04:36:07.029 --> 04:36:07.039 align:start position:0%
educator and recognize that a lot of my
 
04:36:09.390 --> 04:36:09.400 align:start position:0%
students learn in different ways and I'm
 
04:36:11.429 --> 04:36:11.439 align:start position:0%
wondering if there are other ways in
 
04:36:13.789 --> 04:36:13.799 align:start position:0%
which someone who may need a different
 
04:36:17.349 --> 04:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
um examination um receive that and also
 
04:36:19.830 --> 04:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
get scored in an equal manner as if they
 
04:36:22.429 --> 04:36:22.439 align:start position:0%
were not getting accommodations if if
 
04:36:24.029 --> 04:36:24.039 align:start position:0%
that makes sense and it does does
 
04:36:25.869 --> 04:36:25.879 align:start position:0%
fishing game allow for accommodations
 
04:36:28.029 --> 04:36:28.039 align:start position:0%
for written and oral examination when it
 
04:36:30.869 --> 04:36:30.879 align:start position:0%
comes to the guides so that's a good
 
04:36:32.510 --> 04:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
question too we've talked about that
 
04:36:33.750 --> 04:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
that's part of the reason that I get
 
04:36:35.510 --> 04:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
involved in the written exam and take
 
04:36:37.029 --> 04:36:37.039 align:start position:0%
each individual out and go over it
 
04:36:39.230 --> 04:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
question by question cuz that's a that's
 
04:36:40.830 --> 04:36:40.840 align:start position:0%
a qu that's a test that's not going to
 
04:36:43.750 --> 04:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
be like that again so you can do that so
 
04:36:45.189 --> 04:36:45.199 align:start position:0%
when we have the opportunity to do that
 
04:36:47.750 --> 04:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
we do it I don't know how you do it I'm
 
04:36:49.670 --> 04:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
not sure how you could do it in an oral
 
04:36:53.150 --> 04:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
board and keep it fair for everyone I we
 
04:36:54.750 --> 04:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
struggle with that but yes we have we
 
04:36:57.310 --> 04:36:57.320 align:start position:0%
have entertained that we have I don't
 
04:36:58.949 --> 04:36:58.959 align:start position:0%
want to say we've numb tests that's what
 
04:37:00.230 --> 04:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
I was going to say so I guess I'm going
 
04:37:03.230 --> 04:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
to say it we have numbed a test down we
 
04:37:05.551 --> 04:37:05.561 align:start position:0%
have created tests in the past that we
 
04:37:08.310 --> 04:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
felt were too difficult too too high in
 
04:37:11.070 --> 04:37:11.080 align:start position:0%
expectation and we've we've reduced that
 
04:37:13.629 --> 04:37:13.639 align:start position:0%
down uh to address that but we but it's
 
04:37:16.189 --> 04:37:16.199 align:start position:0%
limited what we can do follow up thank
 
04:37:17.990 --> 04:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and then the second
 
04:37:20.789 --> 04:37:20.799 align:start position:0%
question how many of your officers have
 
04:37:23.789 --> 04:37:23.799 align:start position:0%
been or currently are guides that's a
 
04:37:27.109 --> 04:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
good question I have had
 
04:37:30.310 --> 04:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
uh I've had two or three that were
 
04:37:34.109 --> 04:37:34.119 align:start position:0%
guides I believe most of us are not um
 
04:37:35.789 --> 04:37:35.799 align:start position:0%
and and there's a reason reason for that
 
04:37:38.709 --> 04:37:38.719 align:start position:0%
but I've had two or three that were I I
 
04:37:40.310 --> 04:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
don't honestly think I would have the
 
04:37:42.949 --> 04:37:42.959 align:start position:0%
patience for it and I and to be
 
04:37:44.709 --> 04:37:44.719 align:start position:0%
perfectly honest with you I think some
 
04:37:46.109 --> 04:37:46.119 align:start position:0%
of the things that I've heard about I've
 
04:37:47.869 --> 04:37:47.879 align:start position:0%
seen pictures where guides have been
 
04:37:50.150 --> 04:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
over and let a client lay across their
 
04:37:52.629 --> 04:37:52.639 align:start position:0%
back to shoot I I don't think I could do
 
04:37:55.551 --> 04:37:55.561 align:start position:0%
that so I none of that we've had but we
 
04:37:57.590 --> 04:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
have had I think we've had three that I
 
04:38:00.029 --> 04:38:00.039 align:start position:0%
can think of uh and two of those are now
 
04:38:01.990 --> 04:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
retired so we have one right now that is
 
04:38:02.000 --> 04:38:02.830 align:start position:0%
retired so we have one right now that is
a

04:38:02.830 --> 04:38:02.840 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:38:05.750 --> 04:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
guide and uh representative Morton
 
04:38:07.390 --> 04:38:07.400 align:start position:0%
oh but by the I will one other thing I
 
04:38:08.869 --> 04:38:08.879 align:start position:0%
think is important I have made the all
 
04:38:10.709 --> 04:38:10.719 align:start position:0%
of my officers every one of them take
 
04:38:13.949 --> 04:38:13.959 align:start position:0%
the exam the written exam and they have
 
04:38:15.230 --> 04:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
participated in the oil because if they
 
04:38:17.310 --> 04:38:17.320 align:start position:0%
can't pass it you can't expect anyone
 
04:38:19.750 --> 04:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
else to so thank you for that
 
04:38:21.590 --> 04:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative Morton thank you Mr chair
 
04:38:24.670 --> 04:38:24.680 align:start position:0%
and thank you C Jordan um for taking my
 
04:38:27.269 --> 04:38:27.279 align:start position:0%
question my first thing is on average
 
04:38:29.670 --> 04:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
about how many applicants do you get per
 
04:38:31.789 --> 04:38:31.799 align:start position:0%
cycle I'm kind of got the impression
 
04:38:33.830 --> 04:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
that there's basically two cycles a year
 
04:38:36.349 --> 04:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
right is two now we've reduced It 2 two
 
04:38:37.990 --> 04:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
because of the time involved we're doing
 
04:38:41.869 --> 04:38:41.879 align:start position:0%
backgrounds on all of them we probably
 
04:38:46.709 --> 04:38:46.719 align:start position:0%
do I'm going to say 30 to 50 each time
 
04:38:49.670 --> 04:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
probably follow up
 
04:38:52.109 --> 04:38:52.119 align:start position:0%
and can you give me a percentage of of
 
04:38:53.830 --> 04:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
how many pass I knew you going to ask
 
04:38:56.750 --> 04:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
that so it was it was pretty low in the
 
04:38:58.750 --> 04:38:58.760 align:start position:0%
beginning quite honestly uh once the
 
04:39:00.230 --> 04:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
guide school got going and people
 
04:39:02.390 --> 04:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
started understanding this is the tough
 
04:39:05.390 --> 04:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
test they we've improved that this last
 
04:39:07.230 --> 04:39:07.240 align:start position:0%
round that we just finished I think it
 
04:39:10.029 --> 04:39:10.039 align:start position:0%
was I looked at it was a 70% pass rate
 
04:39:12.949 --> 04:39:12.959 align:start position:0%
we're passing I I'm I'm comfortable when
 
04:39:14.349 --> 04:39:14.359 align:start position:0%
I tell you we're passing more than we
 
04:39:16.349 --> 04:39:16.359 align:start position:0%
fail does everybody pass it no they
 
04:39:20.789 --> 04:39:20.799 align:start position:0%
don't no they don't followup last thing
 
04:39:23.510 --> 04:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
um one of the speakers spoke about
 
04:39:26.070 --> 04:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
grandfathered um guides can you just
 
04:39:27.750 --> 04:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
good point yep there were some Grand
 
04:39:30.029 --> 04:39:30.039 align:start position:0%
he's absolutely correct um I didn't know
 
04:39:31.470 --> 04:39:31.480 align:start position:0%
how to deal with that I didn't think it
 
04:39:33.670 --> 04:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
was fair to take like we do anything
 
04:39:35.709 --> 04:39:35.719 align:start position:0%
that we do you gr grandfather you you've
 
04:39:37.150 --> 04:39:37.160 align:start position:0%
missed those people unfortunately
 
04:39:38.470 --> 04:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
because you weren't strict enough back
 
04:39:40.430 --> 04:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
then I couldn't agree with him more some
 
04:39:41.788 --> 04:39:41.798 align:start position:0%
of those folks shouldn't be out there
 
04:39:43.470 --> 04:39:43.480 align:start position:0%
that's the goal of this whole process is
 
04:39:45.470 --> 04:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we don't do that again
 
04:39:48.230 --> 04:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
we are slowly weeding out those
 
04:39:50.110 --> 04:39:50.120 align:start position:0%
grandfathered guyses there aren't many
 
04:39:52.030 --> 04:39:52.040 align:start position:0%
of them left most of the people that are
 
04:39:53.510 --> 04:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
well a lot of the people that are on
 
04:39:54.910 --> 04:39:54.920 align:start position:0%
right now have gone through the or I
 
04:39:56.788 --> 04:39:56.798 align:start position:0%
went to a recent guide association
 
04:39:59.070 --> 04:39:59.080 align:start position:0%
meeting legislative meeting they invited
 
04:40:01.350 --> 04:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
me to attend and most of the people at
 
04:40:03.390 --> 04:40:03.400 align:start position:0%
that table had gone through the process
 
04:40:05.310 --> 04:40:05.320 align:start position:0%
and I will tell you this that that is
 
04:40:07.550 --> 04:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
something that guides and I didn't bring
 
04:40:09.110 --> 04:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
any ask any of those people to come in
 
04:40:11.590 --> 04:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
here but they feel it's a badge of of
 
04:40:13.550 --> 04:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
honor to have gone through it they feel
 
04:40:15.788 --> 04:40:15.798 align:start position:0%
this is this has brought their field of
 
04:40:18.310 --> 04:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
profession to a to a more higher
 
04:40:19.670 --> 04:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
professional level and they're very
 
04:40:22.110 --> 04:40:22.120 align:start position:0%
pleased with that those from those from
 
04:40:24.070 --> 04:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
who have passed
 
04:40:26.708 --> 04:40:26.718 align:start position:0%
certainly representative
 
04:40:29.110 --> 04:40:29.120 align:start position:0%
AAR thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:40:31.670 --> 04:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
for taking my question Sergeant my
 
04:40:34.910 --> 04:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
question is um so you're uh colonel
 
04:40:38.070 --> 04:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
sorry Sergeant is fine long as you send
 
04:40:40.390 --> 04:40:40.400 align:start position:0%

accountability of of what you have I
 
04:40:51.830 --> 04:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
noticed you you have some metrics of
 
04:40:55.708 --> 04:40:55.718 align:start position:0%
what the pass Ray is yes and so
 
04:40:57.510 --> 04:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
concerning that there's so many people
 
04:41:00.788 --> 04:41:00.798 align:start position:0%
here um with testimony that they
 
04:41:03.110 --> 04:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
experienced people pointing at them do
 
04:41:05.150 --> 04:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
you have
 
04:41:07.350 --> 04:41:07.360 align:start position:0%
meetings with um the New Hampshire
 
04:41:09.430 --> 04:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
guides Association on a regular basis to
 
04:41:12.350 --> 04:41:12.360 align:start position:0%
go over um these things thank you we go
 
04:41:14.030 --> 04:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
over we I've gone over it with the
 
04:41:15.948 --> 04:41:15.958 align:start position:0%
guides who have participated in the oral
 
04:41:17.430 --> 04:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
board I've not gone over it with the
 
04:41:19.590 --> 04:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
association we've gone because um some
 
04:41:21.788 --> 04:41:21.798 align:start position:0%
of those people are the test takers but
 
04:41:24.110 --> 04:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
we've gone over it with the people who
 
04:41:27.868 --> 04:41:27.878 align:start position:0%
the the the oral board is a constant I
 
04:41:30.070 --> 04:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
think your question the oral board is
 
04:41:32.310 --> 04:41:32.320 align:start position:0%
constantly uh evaluating what they're
 
04:41:33.708 --> 04:41:33.718 align:start position:0%
doing and how they're doing it how to
 
04:41:36.150 --> 04:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
improve it the test are always changing
 
04:41:38.670 --> 04:41:38.680 align:start position:0%
so yes the answer to that would be yes
 
04:41:40.868 --> 04:41:40.878 align:start position:0%
we don't do it with the entire
 
04:41:42.910 --> 04:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
Association I'll tell you I've learned
 
04:41:45.070 --> 04:41:45.080 align:start position:0%
that you have to be really this this
 
04:41:48.350 --> 04:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
test is valuable to get out I've learned
 
04:41:50.868 --> 04:41:50.878 align:start position:0%
that the hard way so we're very careful
 
04:41:52.830 --> 04:41:52.840 align:start position:0%
that's why Mr P was answering or
 
04:41:54.788 --> 04:41:54.798 align:start position:0%
testifying very carefully because we've
 
04:41:57.390 --> 04:41:57.400 align:start position:0%
had issues with these questions in the
 
04:41:59.628 --> 04:41:59.638 align:start position:0%
manner that we give it getting out and
 
04:42:01.550 --> 04:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
we feel that defeats the whole purpose
 
04:42:06.150 --> 04:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
so we guard it representative Harvey
 
04:42:08.788 --> 04:42:08.798 align:start position:0%
ju just curious are there any um
 
04:42:11.708 --> 04:42:11.718 align:start position:0%
requirements for reupping like you know
 
04:42:14.350 --> 04:42:14.360 align:start position:0%
teachers need to be recertified every
 
04:42:16.030 --> 04:42:16.040 align:start position:0%
three years is there anything like that
 
04:42:18.750 --> 04:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
in no no so as long as your record is
 
04:42:20.190 --> 04:42:20.200 align:start position:0%
that's a good question we nobody
 
04:42:21.750 --> 04:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
testified to that as long as you you get
 
04:42:23.510 --> 04:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
through it once and your record remains
 
04:42:26.390 --> 04:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
clean from violations you just renew for
 
04:42:28.750 --> 04:42:28.760 align:start position:0%
the feed of the license and and produce
 
04:42:31.110 --> 04:42:31.120 align:start position:0%
your certifications for first aid and
 
04:42:32.788 --> 04:42:32.798 align:start position:0%
CPR to make sure it's current and you're
 
04:42:36.990 --> 04:42:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:38.628 --> 04:42:38.638 align:start position:0%
and representative
 
04:42:41.910 --> 04:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
Khan thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:42:44.590 --> 04:42:44.600 align:start position:0%
Coral yes sir for all the great work you
 
04:42:47.030 --> 04:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
do for all of us and you and you know
 
04:42:50.590 --> 04:42:50.600 align:start position:0%
your department um every testimony and
 
04:42:53.550 --> 04:42:53.560 align:start position:0%
every bill has a merit and lot of things
 
04:42:56.590 --> 04:42:56.600 align:start position:0%
came out and I think that U there is
 
04:42:58.510 --> 04:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
some room for improvement for this
 
04:43:02.830 --> 04:43:02.840 align:start position:0%
testing and results and uh citizen
 
04:43:06.270 --> 04:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
friendly uh guides that the process
 
04:43:09.350 --> 04:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
citizen friendly process so is it
 
04:43:11.070 --> 04:43:11.080 align:start position:0%
possible my question to you is is it
 
04:43:13.470 --> 04:43:13.480 align:start position:0%
possible that the within the commission
 
04:43:15.470 --> 04:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
the rule can be changed and it could be
 
04:43:18.628 --> 04:43:18.638 align:start position:0%
more citizen friendly in future we don't
 
04:43:20.230 --> 04:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
need another
 
04:43:22.470 --> 04:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
RSA I would agree we don't need another
 
04:43:25.788 --> 04:43:25.798 align:start position:0%
RSA um and I certainly would I certainly
 
04:43:28.110 --> 04:43:28.120 align:start position:0%
would be willing to I mean we've had
 
04:43:29.708 --> 04:43:29.718 align:start position:0%
some of those Dave and I have had some
 
04:43:31.990 --> 04:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
of those discussions already about how
 
04:43:33.590 --> 04:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
we might be able to improve it I think
 
04:43:35.230 --> 04:43:35.240 align:start position:0%
there is a limit to how much you can
 
04:43:37.470 --> 04:43:37.480 align:start position:0%
change you know some of it falls to
 
04:43:39.190 --> 04:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
people becoming educated when they come
 
04:43:41.510 --> 04:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
in if they want to pass this thing but I
 
04:43:44.230 --> 04:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
would be willing to go back to see if
 
04:43:47.230 --> 04:43:47.240 align:start position:0%
there's any way maybe on you know coming
 
04:43:49.310 --> 04:43:49.320 align:start position:0%
up with a way to provide the results in
 
04:43:51.230 --> 04:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
a more understanding way if people are
 
04:43:53.390 --> 04:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
struggling with that without providing
 
04:43:56.590 --> 04:43:56.600 align:start position:0%
questions you know I I think we could
 
04:43:58.150 --> 04:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
David I'm sorry but I think we could
 
04:44:01.868 --> 04:44:01.878 align:start position:0%
improve that yes thank you any other
 
04:44:04.510 --> 04:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
questions okay as a final leaving of
 
04:44:06.788 --> 04:44:06.798 align:start position:0%
going to on be speaking for the
 
04:44:08.750 --> 04:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
committee I'm going to request that you
 
04:44:10.708 --> 04:44:10.718 align:start position:0%
provide us information on how much it
 
04:44:12.750 --> 04:44:12.760 align:start position:0%
costs your department to run these test
 
04:44:14.990 --> 04:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
here and I'm going to suggest that the
 
04:44:17.670 --> 04:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
department uh and the guides testing
 
04:44:20.150 --> 04:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
reach out to Frank edbl to find out
 
04:44:21.910 --> 04:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
about potential accommodations for
 
04:44:24.390 --> 04:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
people who learn differently okay and
 
04:44:26.708 --> 04:44:26.718 align:start position:0%
have him maybe review and come up with
 
04:44:29.230 --> 04:44:29.240 align:start position:0%
potentially solutions that don't dumb
 
04:44:31.270 --> 04:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
down the answers but provide a different
 
04:44:34.868 --> 04:44:34.878 align:start position:0%
methodology to the testing process okay
 
04:44:38.190 --> 04:44:38.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:40.830 --> 04:44:40.840 align:start position:0%
you and with that uh if there's anybody
 
04:44:42.990 --> 04:44:43.000 align:start position:0%
else who needs to add to this that
 
04:44:45.750 --> 04:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
hasn't put in a pink sheet let me know
 
04:44:47.470 --> 04:44:47.480 align:start position:0%
and otherwise we're going to close the
 
04:44:47.480 --> 04:44:49.030 align:start position:0%
and otherwise we're going to close the
hearing

04:44:49.030 --> 04:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
04:44:49.040 --> 04:45:03.270 align:start position:0%
hearing
on

04:45:03.270 --> 04:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:03.280 --> 04:45:21.670 align:start position:0%
 
1228

04:45:21.670 --> 04:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:24.150 --> 04:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
all right we are far behind and the
 
04:45:28.510 --> 04:45:28.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor of 1417 has had an emergency so
 
04:45:31.430 --> 04:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do is ask that uh I
 
04:45:34.830 --> 04:45:34.840 align:start position:0%
recognize representative pair and she's
 
04:45:37.430 --> 04:45:37.440 align:start position:0%

suspend and we're going to go on to the
 
04:45:42.628 --> 04:45:42.638 align:start position:0%
next bill after that
 
04:45:46.230 --> 04:45:46.240 align:start position:0%
um let's give me a a minute here to
 
04:46:03.190 --> 04:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:03.200 --> 04:46:09.190 align:start position:0%
 
of

04:46:09.190 --> 04:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:11.430 --> 04:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
all right I'm going to open 1417 and

04:46:27.708 --> 04:46:27.718 align:start position:0%
committee has a has a copy of this uh

representative Reed has been has been
 
04:46:32.070 --> 04:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
called away so I'm introducing
 
04:46:36.310 --> 04:46:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:38.948 --> 04:46:38.958 align:start position:0%

now and give us a few minutes because
 
04:46:53.230 --> 04:46:53.240 align:start position:0%

04:47:03.120 --> 04:52:19.670 align:start position:0%
 
Finance

04:52:19.670 --> 04:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:21.430 --> 04:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
that's fine I think she was the only one
 
04:52:25.590 --> 04:52:25.600 align:start position:0%
missing anyway so had to be the correct
 
04:52:28.070 --> 04:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
one unless it was
 
04:52:32.110 --> 04:52:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:34.590 --> 04:52:34.600 align:start position:0%
matter sorry
 
04:52:36.190 --> 04:52:36.200 align:start position:0%
the position they sit in does not matter
 
04:52:38.310 --> 04:52:38.320 align:start position:0%
to me in the least I have more important
 
04:52:47.670 --> 04:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:50.590 --> 04:52:50.600 align:start position:0%
about okay okay being behind schedule
 
04:52:54.430 --> 04:52:54.440 align:start position:0%

04:52:56.310 --> 04:52:56.320 align:start position:0%
Representative Hull the prime sponsor of
 
04:52:56.320 --> 04:53:02.548 align:start position:0%
Representative Hull the prime sponsor of
the

04:53:02.548 --> 04:53:02.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:02.558 --> 04:53:04.788 align:start position:0%
 
bill

04:53:04.788 --> 04:53:04.798 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:53:06.510 --> 04:53:06.520 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of fishing game
 
04:53:08.788 --> 04:53:08.798 align:start position:0%
representative Hull um representing the
 
04:53:10.590 --> 04:53:10.600 align:start position:0%
towns of Dunbarton hooks at Allenstown
 
04:53:13.788 --> 04:53:13.798 align:start position:0%
in Epsom here to introduce house bill
 
04:53:17.470 --> 04:53:17.480 align:start position:0%
530 or sorry 1530 relative to body
 
04:53:21.070 --> 04:53:21.080 align:start position:0%
cameras for conservation
 
04:53:23.430 --> 04:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
officers several years ago we put in the
 
04:53:25.590 --> 04:53:25.600 align:start position:0%
statute the ability for various Law
 
04:53:27.670 --> 04:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
Enforcement Officers to wear body
 
04:53:30.350 --> 04:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
cameras this is done to protect both the
 
04:53:33.230 --> 04:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
civilians as well as the officers
 
04:53:33.240 --> 04:53:34.910 align:start position:0%
civilians as well as the officers
themselves

04:53:34.910 --> 04:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
04:53:36.548 --> 04:53:36.558 align:start position:0%
and it's done that way so that there's
 
04:53:38.150 --> 04:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
real evidence that can be talked about
 
04:53:40.990 --> 04:53:41.000 align:start position:0%
later in terms of what happened at an
 
04:53:44.310 --> 04:53:44.320 align:start position:0%
incident um unfortunately conservation
 
04:53:47.590 --> 04:53:47.600 align:start position:0%
officers in my eyes and the way the
 
04:53:50.470 --> 04:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
statute is written in 105 are not
 
04:53:51.910 --> 04:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily just a straight law
 
04:53:54.310 --> 04:53:54.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer and because when you
 
04:53:56.430 --> 04:53:56.440 align:start position:0%
give an itemized list if conservation
 
04:53:58.548 --> 04:53:58.558 align:start position:0%
officers doesn't make the magic lists it
 
04:54:00.070 --> 04:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
may not be clear whether they have
 
04:54:02.310 --> 04:54:02.320 align:start position:0%
access to or should be required to wear
 
04:54:04.590 --> 04:54:04.600 align:start position:0%
these cameras
 
04:54:07.590 --> 04:54:07.600 align:start position:0%
um so I'm here in testifying in favor of
 
04:54:11.830 --> 04:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
passing HB 1530 to allow officers to
 
04:54:14.270 --> 04:54:14.280 align:start position:0%
wear these cameras and then once it
 
04:54:16.030 --> 04:54:16.040 align:start position:0%
passes here it has a fiscal note to it
 
04:54:17.510 --> 04:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
it's headed over to finance we will
 
04:54:18.708 --> 04:54:18.718 align:start position:0%
figure out where in the budget we need
 
04:54:21.030 --> 04:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
to get the finance to make this
 
04:54:21.040 --> 04:54:22.948 align:start position:0%
to get the finance to make this
happen

04:54:22.948 --> 04:54:22.958 align:start position:0%
happen
 
04:54:25.670 --> 04:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
um part of this also goes in reference
 
04:54:28.350 --> 04:54:28.360 align:start position:0%
to how the recordings are maintained and
 
04:54:31.270 --> 04:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
who has access to them um people have
 
04:54:32.868 --> 04:54:32.878 align:start position:0%
expressed potential concerns about the
 
04:54:36.070 --> 04:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
privacy of of these recordings but in
 
04:54:38.150 --> 04:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
any case where there's legal action
 
04:54:40.788 --> 04:54:40.798 align:start position:0%
against a citizen obviously the defense
 
04:54:43.868 --> 04:54:43.878 align:start position:0%
Council and the citizen themselves per
 
04:54:47.270 --> 04:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
part first Article 15 should have access
 
04:54:49.510 --> 04:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
to that information so that they can in
 
04:54:51.590 --> 04:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
fact put together their
 
04:54:51.600 --> 04:54:53.590 align:start position:0%
fact put together their
defense

04:54:53.590 --> 04:54:53.600 align:start position:0%
defense
 
04:54:56.990 --> 04:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
um other than that at some level it's a
 
04:54:58.430 --> 04:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
housekeeping measures just to make sure
 
04:55:00.110 --> 04:55:00.120 align:start position:0%
we're including conservation officers in
 
04:55:02.470 --> 04:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
our current statutes relative to body
 
04:55:03.948 --> 04:55:03.958 align:start position:0%
count body
 
04:55:06.430 --> 04:55:06.440 align:start position:0%
camera off for police
 
04:55:08.470 --> 04:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
officers with that I'll close my
 
04:55:10.948 --> 04:55:10.958 align:start position:0%
testimony unless there's direct
 
04:55:14.510 --> 04:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
questions thank you I have one myself uh
 
04:55:15.868 --> 04:55:15.878 align:start position:0%
before I open it up to the others I
 
04:55:18.110 --> 04:55:18.120 align:start position:0%
would ask you uh there's a section that
 
04:55:20.350 --> 04:55:20.360 align:start position:0%
asks about uh or says that they should
 
04:55:22.150 --> 04:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
turn on their cameras when teaching or
 
04:55:23.830 --> 04:55:23.840 align:start position:0%
participating in any capacity in a
 
04:55:25.948 --> 04:55:25.958 align:start position:0%
hunter education class if I'm reading
 
04:55:28.190 --> 04:55:28.200 align:start position:0%
that correctly uh is there a reason we
 
04:55:30.750 --> 04:55:30.760 align:start position:0%
would be recording Hunter education
 
04:55:34.708 --> 04:55:34.718 align:start position:0%
classes so so in all cases is right if a
 
04:55:37.510 --> 04:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officer is being paid
 
04:55:39.868 --> 04:55:39.878 align:start position:0%
and they are in front of the public we
 
04:55:43.830 --> 04:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
would want them right to be accountable
 
04:55:45.590 --> 04:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
if there's an accident I'm not saying
 
04:55:48.510 --> 04:55:48.520 align:start position:0%
there's an accident that right two two
 
04:55:51.590 --> 04:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
students get into an altercation right
 
04:55:54.190 --> 04:55:54.200 align:start position:0%
and the the conservation officer will in
 
04:55:55.910 --> 04:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
fact be the first responder to that
 
04:55:58.150 --> 04:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
altercation right this gives plenty of
 
04:56:01.230 --> 04:56:01.240 align:start position:0%
evidence so um whether the state chooses
 
04:56:03.390 --> 04:56:03.400 align:start position:0%
to prosecute or not whether one of those
 
04:56:04.948 --> 04:56:04.958 align:start position:0%
wants to do a civil action against the
 
04:56:07.910 --> 04:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
other there is at least something to to
 
04:56:10.590 --> 04:56:10.600 align:start position:0%
quantify in in
 
04:56:14.590 --> 04:56:14.600 align:start position:0%
audiovisual right what happened so it's
 
04:56:16.110 --> 04:56:16.120 align:start position:0%
they're doing a job for the state at
 
04:56:17.590 --> 04:56:17.600 align:start position:0%
that point so it should be inclusive of
 
04:56:19.708 --> 04:56:19.718 align:start position:0%
all of their job that is currently not
 
04:56:23.470 --> 04:56:23.480 align:start position:0%
listed in in 105 so that would make
 
04:56:26.110 --> 04:56:26.120 align:start position:0%
would would add to the list thank you
 
04:56:27.990 --> 04:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
and I can confirm to the committee this
 
04:56:29.910 --> 04:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
is an early bill it is going to finance
 
04:56:31.270 --> 04:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
to try to figure out where the money
 
04:56:34.230 --> 04:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
comes from for these um it is an early
 
04:56:36.590 --> 04:56:36.600 align:start position:0%
bill um so it has a second committee to
 
04:56:38.788 --> 04:56:38.798 align:start position:0%
go through and with that I will take
 
04:56:40.750 --> 04:56:40.760 align:start position:0%
questions does anybody have any uh we'll
 
04:56:42.510 --> 04:56:42.520 align:start position:0%
start with representative Harvey because
 
04:56:45.590 --> 04:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
your hand was up really immediately I'm
 
04:56:48.430 --> 04:56:48.440 align:start position:0%
sorry I it it isn't an order of
 
04:56:51.590 --> 04:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
importance but thank you Mr chair um and
 
04:56:53.590 --> 04:56:53.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um I
 
04:56:56.070 --> 04:56:56.080 align:start position:0%
sit on a budget Committee in my hometown
 
04:56:58.430 --> 04:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
and we talk about body cameras a lot for
 
04:57:00.708 --> 04:57:00.718 align:start position:0%
police officers and one of the issues
 
04:57:01.990 --> 04:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
that has always brought up is the
 
04:57:07.750 --> 04:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
storage and the um having the enough uh
 
04:57:10.350 --> 04:57:10.360 align:start position:0%
space for the storage H how is that
 
04:57:12.310 --> 04:57:12.320 align:start position:0%
addressed so so that would be part of
 
04:57:15.070 --> 04:57:15.080 align:start position:0%
the financial and the contract right in
 
04:57:16.708 --> 04:57:16.718 align:start position:0%
all likelihood the department would
 
04:57:19.070 --> 04:57:19.080 align:start position:0%
would um hire or contract with an
 
04:57:21.548 --> 04:57:21.558 align:start position:0%
outside agency who is responsible for
 
04:57:24.430 --> 04:57:24.440 align:start position:0%
camera maintenance camera upkeep as well
 
04:57:27.830 --> 04:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
as things like data storage um given the
 
04:57:30.628 --> 04:57:30.638 align:start position:0%
world that we live in data storage is is
 
04:57:33.430 --> 04:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
growing um enormously fast around around
 
04:57:35.670 --> 04:57:35.680 align:start position:0%
the world as as more and more video is
 
04:57:39.830 --> 04:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
created captured and stored so follow up
 
04:57:42.510 --> 04:57:42.520 align:start position:0%
thank you so that would all be part of
 
04:57:44.830 --> 04:57:44.840 align:start position:0%
what is discussed then in finance
 
04:57:48.350 --> 04:57:48.360 align:start position:0%
correct so so if I can this is a policy
 
04:57:50.030 --> 04:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
is this the right policy for fishing
 
04:57:51.628 --> 04:57:51.638 align:start position:0%
game if this is the right policy for
 
04:57:53.708 --> 04:57:53.718 align:start position:0%
fishing game this then moves over to
 
04:57:56.150 --> 04:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
finance and we have to figure out where
 
04:57:59.230 --> 04:57:59.240 align:start position:0%
in I believe it' be division one the
 
04:58:01.190 --> 04:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
money's going to come from to do
 
04:58:04.470 --> 04:58:04.480 align:start position:0%
this and we all already have contracts
 
04:58:06.190 --> 04:58:06.200 align:start position:0%
with some camera providers for storage
 
04:58:08.270 --> 04:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
and cameras with the state correct
 
04:58:10.470 --> 04:58:10.480 align:start position:0%
correct and there is already a fund for
 
04:58:12.590 --> 04:58:12.600 align:start position:0%
some of this the question is do they
 
04:58:14.750 --> 04:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
have legal access today to that fund and
 
04:58:17.190 --> 04:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
it's not real clear this bill addresses
 
04:58:19.990 --> 04:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
that and that's the finance question any
 
04:58:21.708 --> 04:58:21.718 align:start position:0%
other questions representative per you
 
04:58:24.190 --> 04:58:24.200 align:start position:0%
still have a question go for it uh you
 
04:58:27.190 --> 04:58:27.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned that um the officer camera
 
04:58:28.390 --> 04:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
should be on when they're teaching
 
04:58:31.868 --> 04:58:31.878 align:start position:0%
hunter safety courses um police tend to
 
04:58:35.350 --> 04:58:35.360 align:start position:0%
hold public events and go to schools and
 
04:58:38.270 --> 04:58:38.280 align:start position:0%
and um participate in other things that
 
04:58:41.070 --> 04:58:41.080 align:start position:0%
are not what we might consider directly
 
04:58:43.590 --> 04:58:43.600 align:start position:0%
part of their active duty right do they
 
04:58:46.708 --> 04:58:46.718 align:start position:0%
have to record those I'm hesitant that
 
04:58:49.430 --> 04:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
um this bill doesn't speak to that no
 
04:58:52.350 --> 04:58:52.360 align:start position:0%
but it you
 
04:58:56.430 --> 04:58:56.440 align:start position:0%
um uh referenced the the fact that um
 
04:58:58.948 --> 04:58:58.958 align:start position:0%
this is similar to what police officers
 
04:59:03.548 --> 04:59:03.558 align:start position:0%
do in uh so I'm just wondering if
 
04:59:06.310 --> 04:59:06.320 align:start position:0%
these sort of ancillary things are
 
04:59:09.430 --> 04:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
recorded in other services I I don't
 
04:59:12.150 --> 04:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
believe they are that's why if you look
 
04:59:14.350 --> 04:59:14.360 align:start position:0%
at what is currently
 
04:59:17.150 --> 04:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
in end of
 
04:59:21.830 --> 04:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
um section three starting right at 3A
 
04:59:23.190 --> 04:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
right there's a list of things where
 
04:59:25.310 --> 04:59:25.320 align:start position:0%
there's recording images in the current
 
04:59:29.548 --> 04:59:29.558 align:start position:0%
105 this is page two starting at line 17
 
04:59:32.548 --> 04:59:32.558 align:start position:0%
and down okay and the things that are
 
04:59:37.590 --> 04:59:37.600 align:start position:0%
one two 2 three four are are all current
 
04:59:41.670 --> 04:59:41.680 align:start position:0%
law five sorry uh it would be before B
 
04:59:44.548 --> 04:59:44.558 align:start position:0%
and C C and D would be
 
04:59:44.558 --> 04:59:46.390 align:start position:0%
and C C and D would be
new

04:59:46.390 --> 04:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
new
 
04:59:49.868 --> 04:59:49.878 align:start position:0%
and um Hunter education is not the same
 
04:59:52.590 --> 04:59:52.600 align:start position:0%
as a law as like a classroom so Hunter
 
04:59:54.470 --> 04:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
education is someone choosing to
 
04:59:56.590 --> 04:59:56.600 align:start position:0%
participate with the department for the
 
04:59:58.230 --> 04:59:58.240 align:start position:0%
purpose of learning and that it's
 
04:59:59.190 --> 04:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
different than let's say a law
 
05:00:00.868 --> 05:00:00.878 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer going into a school
 
05:00:05.590 --> 05:00:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:09.350 --> 05:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:12.190 --> 05:00:12.200 align:start position:0%
you Vice chair
 
05:00:15.750 --> 05:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you Mr
 
05:00:18.510 --> 05:00:18.520 align:start position:0%
chair I need to follow up with that last
 
05:00:21.230 --> 05:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
remark you made because I know in
 
05:00:23.350 --> 05:00:23.360 align:start position:0%
Manchester we have the Dare program
 
05:00:25.310 --> 05:00:25.320 align:start position:0%
where police officers train kids whether
 
05:00:28.670 --> 05:00:28.680 align:start position:0%
it's boxing or it stuff like
 
05:00:31.230 --> 05:00:31.240 align:start position:0%
that and I do not believe they wear
 
05:00:33.628 --> 05:00:33.638 align:start position:0%
cameras for those events
 
05:00:35.030 --> 05:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
why would
 
05:00:37.310 --> 05:00:37.320 align:start position:0%
that differentiate between that and
 
05:00:37.320 --> 05:00:39.070 align:start position:0%
that differentiate between that and
hunter's

05:00:39.070 --> 05:00:39.080 align:start position:0%
hunter's
 
05:00:43.670 --> 05:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
ed so I it was drafted in such a way
 
05:00:45.910 --> 05:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
that it includes all of the duties where
 
05:00:48.150 --> 05:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement officer and this say
 
05:00:51.030 --> 05:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
conservation officer is performing their
 
05:00:53.510 --> 05:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
job um that is currently not the
 
05:00:54.750 --> 05:00:54.760 align:start position:0%
standards for
 
05:00:57.510 --> 05:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
police relative to things like teaching
 
05:00:59.070 --> 05:00:59.080 align:start position:0%
dare courses right they might come in
 
05:01:01.350 --> 05:01:01.360 align:start position:0%
and teach they might come in and teach
 
05:01:03.948 --> 05:01:03.958 align:start position:0%
uh some sort of generalized safety
 
05:01:06.150 --> 05:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
course relative to walking to your car
 
05:01:08.788 --> 05:01:08.798 align:start position:0%
late at night to 11th and 12th
 
05:01:10.590 --> 05:01:10.600 align:start position:0%
graders I don't believe those are
 
05:01:12.948 --> 05:01:12.958 align:start position:0%
currently covered under
 
05:01:12.958 --> 05:01:16.150 align:start position:0%
currently covered under
law

05:01:16.150 --> 05:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:19.270 --> 05:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
followup would you be amendable to
 
05:01:21.030 --> 05:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
changing it so that it's the same
 
05:01:23.230 --> 05:01:23.240 align:start position:0%
situations as police officers currently
 
05:01:25.548 --> 05:01:25.558 align:start position:0%
where it's we interaction with someone
 
05:01:31.390 --> 05:01:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:33.430 --> 05:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
duties depends how you Define
 
05:01:36.030 --> 05:01:36.040 align:start position:0%
interaction with someone right this is
 
05:01:38.670 --> 05:01:38.680 align:start position:0%
set up to just broadly capture their
 
05:01:42.350 --> 05:01:42.360 align:start position:0%
their role as a conservation officer um
 
05:01:44.548 --> 05:01:44.558 align:start position:0%
so if you do an interaction with
 
05:01:47.990 --> 05:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
someone what happens if they are in the
 
05:01:51.150 --> 05:01:51.160 align:start position:0%
field they see an animal animal's got an
 
05:01:53.990 --> 05:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
arrow sticking out of its chest right
 
05:01:55.190 --> 05:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
does that get recorded they're not
 
05:01:56.590 --> 05:01:56.600 align:start position:0%
interacting with somebody but that's
 
05:01:58.190 --> 05:01:58.200 align:start position:0%
actual tangible evidence that's going to
 
05:02:01.750 --> 05:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:05.910 --> 05:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
on so conservation officers do in fact
 
05:02:08.788 --> 05:02:08.798 align:start position:0%
do law enforcement under 207 I don't
 
05:02:11.150 --> 05:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
remember the exact section um one of the
 
05:02:12.708 --> 05:02:12.718 align:start position:0%
attorneys behind me can probably point
 
05:02:16.628 --> 05:02:16.638 align:start position:0%
out where under the Conservation
 
05:02:18.990 --> 05:02:19.000 align:start position:0%
Commission there is a rule they are also
 
05:02:21.788 --> 05:02:21.798 align:start position:0%
allowed to do any law enforcement duties
 
05:02:24.670 --> 05:02:24.680 align:start position:0%
um in the do the DMV
 
05:02:26.948 --> 05:02:26.958 align:start position:0%
statutes but they also were in the field
 
05:02:28.110 --> 05:02:28.120 align:start position:0%
and they're doing things like
 
05:02:30.628 --> 05:02:30.638 align:start position:0%
interacting with what's with this dead
 
05:02:32.910 --> 05:02:32.920 align:start position:0%
animal right how did it get to be there
 
05:02:34.390 --> 05:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
and and and there's different duties
 
05:02:35.708 --> 05:02:35.718 align:start position:0%
where it's not just interacting with
 
05:02:37.670 --> 05:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
people so I would think it has to be
 
05:02:39.270 --> 05:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
defined a little bit more
 
05:02:41.390 --> 05:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
broadly thank
 
05:02:44.670 --> 05:02:44.680 align:start position:0%
you any further
 
05:02:47.430 --> 05:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
questions representative Darby thank you
 
05:02:48.868 --> 05:02:48.878 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
05:02:51.830 --> 05:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
question representative um section three
 
05:02:53.030 --> 05:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
which is the section where the
 
05:02:56.150 --> 05:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
additional criteria has is being added
 
05:03:00.590 --> 05:03:00.600 align:start position:0%
the the Clause line on um line 21 of
 
05:03:04.788 --> 05:03:04.798 align:start position:0%
page two um says is talking about re
 
05:03:07.070 --> 05:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
retaining recordings for a minimum of
 
05:03:09.948 --> 05:03:09.958 align:start position:0%
three years when and you know it says
 
05:03:11.510 --> 05:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
the the two cases we've talked about
 
05:03:13.548 --> 05:03:13.558 align:start position:0%
here teaching and interacting with
 
05:03:15.990 --> 05:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
Sportsmen so this is actually saying
 
05:03:18.230 --> 05:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
that um every interaction with Sportsmen
 
05:03:20.190 --> 05:03:20.200 align:start position:0%
have to has to be retained for three
 
05:03:23.070 --> 05:03:23.080 align:start position:0%
years whereas in the standard case as
 
05:03:27.548 --> 05:03:27.558 align:start position:0%
described in at line 18 they can be um
 
05:03:31.270 --> 05:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh over uh re-recorded after between 30
 
05:03:33.390 --> 05:03:33.400 align:start position:0%
days and 180 days so why would these
 
05:03:36.350 --> 05:03:36.360 align:start position:0%
have to stick around for three years so
 
05:03:38.030 --> 05:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
I believe that's current law um if
 
05:03:39.548 --> 05:03:39.558 align:start position:0%
someone can pull up that section of
 
05:03:41.390 --> 05:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
Statute right I don't believe that is a
 
05:03:44.510 --> 05:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
change the way this is the way ol drafts
 
05:03:45.910 --> 05:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
things right if that was in bold that
 
05:03:47.350 --> 05:03:47.360 align:start position:0%
would be a change to current law I
 
05:03:50.350 --> 05:03:50.360 align:start position:0%
believe that is our current law um D
 
05:03:51.910 --> 05:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
interactions with Sportsmen including
 
05:03:53.470 --> 05:03:53.480 align:start position:0%
but not limited to Hunters Trappers and
 
05:03:58.270 --> 05:03:58.280 align:start position:0%
fishermen is bold and yes I understand
 
05:04:00.590 --> 05:04:00.600 align:start position:0%
to 22 and so is the
 
05:04:04.390 --> 05:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
teaching2 is is would be statute
 
05:04:07.030 --> 05:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
correct if if drafted by o that's the
 
05:04:08.548 --> 05:04:08.558 align:start position:0%
way I to
 
05:04:11.430 --> 05:04:11.440 align:start position:0%
expect it doesn't say repeal and replace
 
05:04:16.070 --> 05:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:18.390 --> 05:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
modify if someone has a book otherwise
 
05:04:20.470 --> 05:04:20.480 align:start position:0%
I'll quickly pull it
 
05:04:23.190 --> 05:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
up Mr
 
05:04:25.830 --> 05:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
chairman I can I can confirm that that
 
05:04:28.230 --> 05:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
rep kofalt uh thank you Mr chairman yes
 
05:04:32.990 --> 05:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
I can confirm that that um lines 18
 
05:04:37.548 --> 05:04:37.558 align:start position:0%
through 22 are in current Statute in
 
05:04:39.708 --> 05:04:39.718 align:start position:0%
Section 105
 
05:04:44.830 --> 05:04:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:48.510 --> 05:04:48.520 align:start position:0%
you but I think the question was why
 
05:04:51.390 --> 05:04:51.400 align:start position:0%
does the criteria include now a new
 
05:04:53.430 --> 05:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
criteria of interactions with Sportsmen
 
05:04:54.830 --> 05:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
as being a reason you would keep it for
 
05:04:57.030 --> 05:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
three years instead
 
05:05:00.910 --> 05:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
of and that's new the criteria C and D
 
05:05:03.310 --> 05:05:03.320 align:start position:0%
are both new criteria for holding at 3
 
05:05:05.628 --> 05:05:05.638 align:start position:0%
years correct C and D are added to the
 
05:05:07.110 --> 05:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
statute right and they would fall to
 
05:05:09.430 --> 05:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
hold for three years not just 30 days or
 
05:05:11.868 --> 05:05:11.878 align:start position:0%
until something happen and we could set
 
05:05:14.390 --> 05:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
that up that if that was either the 30
 
05:05:18.430 --> 05:05:18.440 align:start position:0%
or the 180 Day level right the the three
 
05:05:22.350 --> 05:05:22.360 align:start position:0%
years was capture was was a broad term
 
05:05:24.070 --> 05:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
but that was existing statute I wasn't
 
05:05:27.190 --> 05:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
making changes to that I was just adding
 
05:05:28.510 --> 05:05:28.520 align:start position:0%
certain cases where we should be
 
05:05:31.470 --> 05:05:31.480 align:start position:0%
capturing data or capturing
 
05:05:34.430 --> 05:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
interactions so did you want to follow
 
05:05:36.548 --> 05:05:36.558 align:start position:0%
up um
 
05:05:40.910 --> 05:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
I I I understand the intent the intent
 
05:05:43.190 --> 05:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
is to make sure that these um
 
05:05:45.670 --> 05:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
interactions um with Sportsmen and in
 
05:05:48.670 --> 05:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
training facilities are uh recorded but
 
05:05:51.510 --> 05:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
it appears to me um that where it was
 
05:05:56.830 --> 05:05:56.840 align:start position:0%
put in uh where where lisr um sorry OLS
 
05:05:58.430 --> 05:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
captured this is stating that you're
 
05:05:59.830 --> 05:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
going to require this to be stored for
 
05:06:05.470 --> 05:06:05.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:06.830 --> 05:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
I agree that's the way I read it to
 
05:06:09.070 --> 05:06:09.080 align:start position:0%
representative Darby and and it probably
 
05:06:11.830 --> 05:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
should have been in the in the 180 days
 
05:06:15.670 --> 05:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
area or what have you the standard
 
05:06:20.070 --> 05:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
unless something happened in the class
 
05:06:21.350 --> 05:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
or in the
 
05:06:25.590 --> 05:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
interaction that made it
 
05:06:28.788 --> 05:06:28.798 align:start position:0%
evidentiary any other questions
 
05:06:31.990 --> 05:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Brown thank you Mr
 
05:06:32.000 --> 05:06:33.390 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Brown thank you Mr
chairman

05:06:33.390 --> 05:06:33.400 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
05:06:36.590 --> 05:06:36.600 align:start position:0%
so on D on interactions with Sportsman
 
05:06:38.788 --> 05:06:38.798 align:start position:0%
do do you think that might
 
05:06:41.150 --> 05:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
include and speaking from personal
 
05:06:43.430 --> 05:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
experience where fishing game
 
05:06:46.470 --> 05:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
conservation officer may go on a field
 
05:06:52.150 --> 05:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:54.510 --> 05:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
expert uh can you better describe what
 
05:06:57.190 --> 05:06:57.200 align:start position:0%
this situation would be I'm not aware
 
05:06:59.350 --> 05:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
that fishing game officers go on field
 
05:07:02.070 --> 05:07:02.080 align:start position:0%
trips as scientific experts so yes they
 
05:07:05.990 --> 05:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
do and and having uh worked at Dees for
 
05:07:08.628 --> 05:07:08.638 align:start position:0%
years we used to we used to do uh field
 
05:07:10.070 --> 05:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
trips we used to take the waste
 
05:07:11.868 --> 05:07:11.878 align:start position:0%
management Council out to the to the
 
05:07:14.548 --> 05:07:14.558 align:start position:0%
coast and explain programs and often
 
05:07:16.030 --> 05:07:16.040 align:start position:0%
fishing game would come along as an
 
05:07:19.110 --> 05:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
expert on on Coastal issues or whatever
 
05:07:20.990 --> 05:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
and similar to what we did this summer
 
05:07:23.110 --> 05:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
with the boat so you have people there
 
05:07:26.590 --> 05:07:26.600 align:start position:0%
as let's call them uh uh what's the word
 
05:07:28.110 --> 05:07:28.120 align:start position:0%
scientific experts that's not the right
 
05:07:32.788 --> 05:07:32.798 align:start position:0%
word but uh okay and what that that is
 
05:07:34.430 --> 05:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
it could be considered to be an
 
05:07:37.670 --> 05:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
interaction under d i I would I would
 
05:07:41.470 --> 05:07:41.480 align:start position:0%
put that under an interaction okay um
 
05:07:43.868 --> 05:07:43.878 align:start position:0%
right because potentially any of those
 
05:07:46.110 --> 05:07:46.120 align:start position:0%
members in that group could be Sportsmen
 
05:07:47.310 --> 05:07:47.320 align:start position:0%
right if they're doing something at the
 
05:07:50.150 --> 05:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
ring y okay thank
 
05:07:53.830 --> 05:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
you uh representative
 
05:07:57.270 --> 05:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you Mr chair I got to go
 
05:08:00.590 --> 05:08:00.600 align:start position:0%
back to this is I'm not sure why
 
05:08:03.190 --> 05:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
there's two stand
 
05:08:04.750 --> 05:08:04.760 align:start position:0%
one for conservation officers and one
 
05:08:07.990 --> 05:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
for regular law enforcement on line 26
 
05:08:09.430 --> 05:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
on page
 
05:08:13.030 --> 05:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
one that if the firearm is used for uh
 
05:08:14.708 --> 05:08:14.718 align:start position:0%
the dispatch of an animal for law
 
05:08:16.670 --> 05:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement it doesn't need to be
 
05:08:18.430 --> 05:08:18.440 align:start position:0%
preserved but if it does for by a
 
05:08:20.910 --> 05:08:20.920 align:start position:0%
conservation officer it is preserved I
 
05:08:22.110 --> 05:08:22.120 align:start position:0%
want to know why there's that double
 
05:08:24.830 --> 05:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
standard that versus you have a police
 
05:08:26.470 --> 05:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
officer and a conservation officer on
 
05:08:28.190 --> 05:08:28.200 align:start position:0%
the same scene with an animal that's hit
 
05:08:30.830 --> 05:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
by a car if one of them dispatches the
 
05:08:32.510 --> 05:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
animal the recording does doesn't need
 
05:08:34.190 --> 05:08:34.200 align:start position:0%
to be saved but if the other one does it
 
05:08:38.750 --> 05:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:38.760 --> 05:08:40.830 align:start position:0%
 
captured

05:08:40.830 --> 05:08:40.840 align:start position:0%
captured
 
05:08:43.948 --> 05:08:43.958 align:start position:0%
so it's an assumption on my part it's
 
05:08:45.390 --> 05:08:45.400 align:start position:0%
probably would be born out if we asked
 
05:08:49.990 --> 05:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
for data that conservation officers um
 
05:08:51.830 --> 05:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
especially in the field interact with
 
05:08:54.750 --> 05:08:54.760 align:start position:0%
more animal carcasses than they do right
 
05:08:57.948 --> 05:08:57.958 align:start position:0%
let's say they found they find an animal
 
05:09:00.628 --> 05:09:00.638 align:start position:0%
um that's been hit by an arrow and it's
 
05:09:02.548 --> 05:09:02.558 align:start position:0%
flopping around in and they're to put it
 
05:09:05.590 --> 05:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
down right police officers especially
 
05:09:07.350 --> 05:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
state troopers are going to see the
 
05:09:10.910 --> 05:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
animals hit by cars right that and they
 
05:09:13.070 --> 05:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
may be charged with putting them down
 
05:09:16.150 --> 05:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
but in this case fishing game officers
 
05:09:18.030 --> 05:09:18.040 align:start position:0%
are going to be be pursuing something
 
05:09:20.910 --> 05:09:20.920 align:start position:0%
that might be a crime more than a car
 
05:09:24.310 --> 05:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:26.708 --> 05:09:26.718 align:start position:0%
animal their jobs descriptions are
 
05:09:30.750 --> 05:09:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:35.430 --> 05:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
up so I guess my question goes
 
05:09:37.868 --> 05:09:37.878 align:start position:0%
to should all of these incidents be
 
05:09:39.708 --> 05:09:39.718 align:start position:0%
recorded or just those in where a crime
 
05:09:41.310 --> 05:09:41.320 align:start position:0%
may be involved
 
05:09:44.150 --> 05:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
or and I just don't see the double
 
05:09:46.470 --> 05:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
standard where two people at the scene
 
05:09:48.430 --> 05:09:48.440 align:start position:0%
depending on who dispatches the animal
 
05:09:51.150 --> 05:09:51.160 align:start position:0%
whether it's saved or isn't saved it's a
 
05:09:54.030 --> 05:09:54.040 align:start position:0%
good point and the question is is in
 
05:09:55.788 --> 05:09:55.798 align:start position:0%
putting down that animal something
 
05:09:58.830 --> 05:09:58.840 align:start position:0%
that's tangible evidence necessary
 
05:10:01.230 --> 05:10:01.240 align:start position:0%
for hypothetically right if we're going
 
05:10:03.868 --> 05:10:03.878 align:start position:0%
to use a HP pathetical situation right
 
05:10:07.270 --> 05:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
we have a um a motor vehicle operator
 
05:10:10.270 --> 05:10:10.280 align:start position:0%
Under the Influence hits a deer right
 
05:10:12.990 --> 05:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
causes some other accident along the way
 
05:10:15.230 --> 05:10:15.240 align:start position:0%
so maybe that needs to be preserved the
 
05:10:18.270 --> 05:10:18.280 align:start position:0%
dispatching of that animal and that we
 
05:10:19.708 --> 05:10:19.718 align:start position:0%
need to update the statutes there
 
05:10:20.990 --> 05:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
because that might be valuable
 
05:10:23.190 --> 05:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
information in the prosecution or
 
05:10:25.310 --> 05:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
potential prosecution for a driving
 
05:10:28.628 --> 05:10:28.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:31.750 --> 05:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
Influence representative Harvey uh thank
 
05:10:33.190 --> 05:10:33.200 align:start position:0%
you Mr Mr chair and thank you for taking
 
05:10:36.190 --> 05:10:36.200 align:start position:0%
my question um so the longer we talk
 
05:10:37.670 --> 05:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
about this the more and more confused
 
05:10:41.868 --> 05:10:41.878 align:start position:0%
I'm getting because um um there's so
 
05:10:41.878 --> 05:10:44.310 align:start position:0%
I'm getting because um um there's so
many

05:10:44.310 --> 05:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
many
 
05:10:46.430 --> 05:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
interactions so-called with with
 
05:10:49.628 --> 05:10:49.638 align:start position:0%
Sportsmen that I don't think has to be
 
05:10:51.070 --> 05:10:51.080 align:start position:0%
recorded for
 
05:10:54.110 --> 05:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
instance um they've often taken our
 
05:10:56.910 --> 05:10:56.920 align:start position:0%
committee on field trips that that
 
05:10:58.628 --> 05:10:58.638 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to be recorded in fact I
 
05:11:01.670 --> 05:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want me being recorded there so
 
05:11:03.470 --> 05:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if you would be
 
05:11:06.830 --> 05:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
amenable to you know maybe an interim
 
05:11:09.110 --> 05:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
study or something because I I'm just
 
05:11:11.470 --> 05:11:11.480 align:start position:0%
sitting here listening to this and I'm
 
05:11:13.548 --> 05:11:13.558 align:start position:0%
getting more and more
 
05:11:17.230 --> 05:11:17.240 align:start position:0%
confused so I broadly speaking if the
 
05:11:19.590 --> 05:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
bill was filed for the inim study right
 
05:11:21.190 --> 05:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
we could have done this study without a
 
05:11:23.548 --> 05:11:23.558 align:start position:0%
bill right we could we as legislators we
 
05:11:27.030 --> 05:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
could um look at the topic ourselves
 
05:11:28.750 --> 05:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
bill was filed to make changes to the
 
05:11:30.990 --> 05:11:31.000 align:start position:0%
statutes for the purpose of making sure
 
05:11:32.868 --> 05:11:32.878 align:start position:0%
that interactions with within this
 
05:11:35.390 --> 05:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
department um were captured and that
 
05:11:37.030 --> 05:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
this department would have access to the
 
05:11:38.590 --> 05:11:38.600 align:start position:0%
funds that are available for other
 
05:11:44.910 --> 05:11:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:48.470 --> 05:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
today other questions representative
 
05:11:50.948 --> 05:11:50.958 align:start position:0%
Darby thank you Mr chair thank you again
 
05:11:53.708 --> 05:11:53.718 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I am I am
 
05:11:55.510 --> 05:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
concerned actually as I read the rest of
 
05:11:58.548 --> 05:11:58.558 align:start position:0%
the statute on 105 D2 which is the use
 
05:12:00.830 --> 05:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
of body warn cameras which is what um
 
05:12:02.510 --> 05:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
section three amends
 
05:12:06.708 --> 05:12:06.718 align:start position:0%
for example um subsection 7e says that
 
05:12:09.708 --> 05:12:09.718 align:start position:0%
interactions with a person s seeking to
 
05:12:12.510 --> 05:12:12.520 align:start position:0%
report a crime anonymously should not be
 
05:12:16.150 --> 05:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
recorded it also says that um on uh
 
05:12:18.430 --> 05:12:18.440 align:start position:0%
police officers or sorry law enforcement
 
05:12:20.430 --> 05:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
officers on the grounds of a public
 
05:12:22.628 --> 05:12:22.638 align:start position:0%
private or parial school should not be
 
05:12:24.510 --> 05:12:24.520 align:start position:0%
recorded these seem to contradict
 
05:12:28.788 --> 05:12:28.798 align:start position:0%
directly with CD um that as
 
05:12:34.390 --> 05:12:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:35.910 --> 05:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
you said section seven I'm pulling it up
 
05:12:39.510 --> 05:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
so I can I can take a look at it 105 d27
 
05:12:47.868 --> 05:12:47.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:51.470 --> 05:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
examples I did not ask OSS to make
 
05:12:53.910 --> 05:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
changes to the rest of the statute right
 
05:12:57.350 --> 05:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
it was the language change was relative
 
05:13:00.470 --> 05:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
to the H Hunter education classes and
 
05:13:03.310 --> 05:13:03.320 align:start position:0%
then kind of w interacting with Hunters
 
05:13:05.230 --> 05:13:05.240 align:start position:0%
Trappers and fishermen right in the
 
05:13:07.430 --> 05:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
field and maybe we need to make it clear
 
05:13:12.270 --> 05:13:12.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:12.280 --> 05:13:14.990 align:start position:0%
 
field

05:13:14.990 --> 05:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
field
 
05:13:17.788 --> 05:13:17.798 align:start position:0%
right um I didn't I wasn't part of the
 
05:13:19.270 --> 05:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
group that wrote
 
05:13:23.510 --> 05:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
105d that this is OS as we requested of
 
05:13:27.270 --> 05:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
os put into statute right recording
 
05:13:29.590 --> 05:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
under the following
 
05:13:32.230 --> 05:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
circumstances question the chair
 
05:13:35.230 --> 05:13:35.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:37.750 --> 05:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you Mr chair
 
05:13:40.750 --> 05:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
I'm getting really confused in this
 
05:13:43.590 --> 05:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
subject matter it's
 
05:13:46.190 --> 05:13:46.200 align:start position:0%
almost criminal justice Public Safety
 
05:13:48.788 --> 05:13:48.798 align:start position:0%
type of material not fishing game
 
05:13:50.910 --> 05:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
committee material that we're dealing
 
05:13:52.510 --> 05:13:52.520 align:start position:0%
with and unfortunately if this goes to a
 
05:13:54.750 --> 05:13:54.760 align:start position:0%
second committee it's going to finance
 
05:13:57.830 --> 05:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
and not criminal justice for a proper
 
05:13:59.070 --> 05:13:59.080 align:start position:0%
vetting because there's a lot in this
 
05:14:01.470 --> 05:14:01.480 align:start position:0%
statute I think that we're covering that
 
05:14:03.990 --> 05:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
really needs to be looked at in order to
 
05:14:05.670 --> 05:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
go forward with something of this nature
 
05:14:07.628 --> 05:14:07.638 align:start position:0%
and I'm just looking for guidance or
 
05:14:09.230 --> 05:14:09.240 align:start position:0%
ordinarily I would have argued that
 
05:14:10.990 --> 05:14:11.000 align:start position:0%
criminal justice probably was the right
 
05:14:13.030 --> 05:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
committee I think given workloads of
 
05:14:15.590 --> 05:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
various committees um and it being
 
05:14:17.390 --> 05:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
relative to fish and game conservation
 
05:14:19.190 --> 05:14:19.200 align:start position:0%
officers that probably got pushed over
 
05:14:21.030 --> 05:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
here but again I don't think anybody in
 
05:14:22.750 --> 05:14:22.760 align:start position:0%
our room in this room here had any part
 
05:14:24.350 --> 05:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
of that
 
05:14:28.310 --> 05:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
decision slightly not and
 
05:14:30.670 --> 05:14:30.680 align:start position:0%
um I
 
05:14:33.788 --> 05:14:33.798 align:start position:0%
uh don't doubt that we should probably
 
05:14:35.830 --> 05:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
uh have potentially criminal justice
 
05:14:38.070 --> 05:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
take a look at things as well however
 
05:14:40.070 --> 05:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
it's obvious that there's several areas
 
05:14:42.070 --> 05:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
that need Amendment amending already as
 
05:14:44.070 --> 05:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
it stands because they seem to be in the
 
05:14:45.910 --> 05:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
keep it for three years rather than the
 
05:14:51.470 --> 05:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
standard area Etc so um I'll have to
 
05:14:53.548 --> 05:14:53.558 align:start position:0%
consult with the chair of Criminal
 
05:14:55.948 --> 05:14:55.958 align:start position:0%
Justice and the speaker and see what uh
 
05:14:58.430 --> 05:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
what Avenues are open for that type of
 
05:15:01.948 --> 05:15:01.958 align:start position:0%
thing um for today I think that it helps
 
05:15:03.750 --> 05:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
us flesh out other issues that can be
 
05:15:05.470 --> 05:15:05.480 align:start position:0%
brought forward by an amendment for the
 
05:15:07.750 --> 05:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor before it hits another committee
 
05:15:09.708 --> 05:15:09.718 align:start position:0%
if we continue listening to some other
 
05:15:10.948 --> 05:15:10.958 align:start position:0%
testimony that we're going to hear from
 
05:15:13.030 --> 05:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
some other people here so I won't cut
 
05:15:16.030 --> 05:15:16.040 align:start position:0%
the hearing short at this point but um
 
05:15:18.590 --> 05:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
we'll keep that in
 
05:15:21.708 --> 05:15:21.718 align:start position:0%
mind representative Harvey so so this is
 
05:15:23.590 --> 05:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
a question of the chair as well because
 
05:15:26.350 --> 05:15:26.360 align:start position:0%
I don't know the time do because this is
 
05:15:28.628 --> 05:15:28.638 align:start position:0%
an early Bill do we have time to do all
 
05:15:30.948 --> 05:15:30.958 align:start position:0%
of what you're suggesting I mean I I
 
05:15:32.190 --> 05:15:32.200 align:start position:0%
that's why I'll be talking to the
 
05:15:35.910 --> 05:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
speaker okay okay thank you
 
05:15:35.920 --> 05:15:37.230 align:start position:0%
speaker okay okay thank you
representative

05:15:37.230 --> 05:15:37.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:15:39.948 --> 05:15:39.958 align:start position:0%
peir thank you Mr chair I think this may
 
05:15:44.110 --> 05:15:44.120 align:start position:0%
be more question for you but whatever um
 
05:15:47.070 --> 05:15:47.080 align:start position:0%
we need to also be aware of adding extra
 
05:15:49.510 --> 05:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
cost in editing these things you know
 
05:15:52.230 --> 05:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
this 20 minutes gets saved here and that
 
05:15:55.590 --> 05:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
hour and a half gets saved there um we
 
05:15:57.548 --> 05:15:57.558 align:start position:0%
don't want to get too bogged down in the
 
05:16:00.510 --> 05:16:00.520 align:start position:0%
in the details
 
05:16:03.990 --> 05:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
of okay I'm guessing um we don't want to
 
05:16:06.628 --> 05:16:06.638 align:start position:0%
get too bogged down in the details of
 
05:16:10.390 --> 05:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
what these recordings are and and so
 
05:16:12.990 --> 05:16:13.000 align:start position:0%
forth again all of that can be done via
 
05:16:14.310 --> 05:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
the thank you for the question all that
 
05:16:15.830 --> 05:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
can be done via the contract with the
 
05:16:17.510 --> 05:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
Outside Agency who would oversee the
 
05:16:20.948 --> 05:16:20.958 align:start position:0%
cameras and the storage um if you start
 
05:16:23.350 --> 05:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
getting into parsing this has to be kept
 
05:16:24.990 --> 05:16:25.000 align:start position:0%
for 30 days and this has to be kept for
 
05:16:26.830 --> 05:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
180 days and this has to be kept for 3
 
05:16:28.910 --> 05:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
years I get you the the default should
 
05:16:30.628 --> 05:16:30.638 align:start position:0%
be we keep it for the 30 or 180 or
 
05:16:32.548 --> 05:16:32.558 align:start position:0%
whatever the the default is and then
 
05:16:34.948 --> 05:16:34.958 align:start position:0%
only if there's an ex
 
05:16:38.868 --> 05:16:38.878 align:start position:0%
uh uh if there's an extenuating
 
05:16:41.990 --> 05:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
circumstance that affects something
 
05:16:44.510 --> 05:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
because it needs to be kept evidentiary
 
05:16:46.190 --> 05:16:46.200 align:start position:0%
evidentiary you can tell it's late in
 
05:16:48.910 --> 05:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
the day um that triggers the longer then
 
05:16:50.390 --> 05:16:50.400 align:start position:0%
we would trigger the longer period of
 
05:16:53.590 --> 05:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
retention okay um so if there are any
 
05:16:56.070 --> 05:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
other questions we'll move on with more
 
05:16:57.430 --> 05:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
and if not then thank you for your
 
05:17:00.110 --> 05:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
testimony today um I would welcome you
 
05:17:03.070 --> 05:17:03.080 align:start position:0%
to uh take the ideas back for an
 
05:17:06.548 --> 05:17:06.558 align:start position:0%
amendment and uh we'll make sure we get
 
05:17:08.470 --> 05:17:08.480 align:start position:0%

County Attorney both of us have been
 
05:17:50.030 --> 05:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
prosecutors for over 20 years at this
 
05:17:55.070 --> 05:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
point um when you look at 105 D2 the
 
05:17:56.750 --> 05:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
body warant camera statute it's actually
 
05:17:59.310 --> 05:17:59.320 align:start position:0%
a very comprehensive statute that a
 
05:18:00.910 --> 05:18:00.920 align:start position:0%
number of stakeholders came together
 
05:18:03.350 --> 05:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
when they P it was involved there were
 
05:18:05.750 --> 05:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
defense attorneys um there were
 
05:18:07.110 --> 05:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
representatives from the Department of
 
05:18:10.310 --> 05:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
Safety police officers police Chiefs and
 
05:18:12.350 --> 05:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
they came up with a fairly comprehensive
 
05:18:15.470 --> 05:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
bill that really can be broken down into
 
05:18:18.590 --> 05:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
two parts the first part of 105 D2
 
05:18:20.548 --> 05:18:20.558 align:start position:0%
addresses the creation of bodyw warn
 
05:18:23.230 --> 05:18:23.240 align:start position:0%
cameras in the field the second part of
 
05:18:25.868 --> 05:18:25.878 align:start position:0%
105 D2 really addresses the handling of
 
05:18:27.548 --> 05:18:27.558 align:start position:0%
bodyw warn cameras after those
 
05:18:30.430 --> 05:18:30.440 align:start position:0%
recordings have been made uh that second
 
05:18:32.868 --> 05:18:32.878 align:start position:0%
part the handling section had I think
 
05:18:34.430 --> 05:18:34.440 align:start position:0%
can be further broken down into
 
05:18:36.350 --> 05:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
essentially four sections the first
 
05:18:40.470 --> 05:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
being um copying or uh Distributing the
 
05:18:42.868 --> 05:18:42.878 align:start position:0%
bodyw warn cameras the second being
 
05:18:44.868 --> 05:18:44.878 align:start position:0%
accessing those bodyw warn camera
 
05:18:47.390 --> 05:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
recordings the the third subsection
 
05:18:49.270 --> 05:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
being storage of the body warn camera
 
05:18:51.990 --> 05:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
recordings and the fourth being the
 
05:18:55.350 --> 05:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
actual retention of the body warn camera
 
05:18:58.190 --> 05:18:58.200 align:start position:0%
recordings as the sponsor indicated it's
 
05:19:00.270 --> 05:19:00.280 align:start position:0%
really a policy whether or not you want
 
05:19:01.990 --> 05:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
fishing game officer
 
05:19:04.070 --> 05:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
to be wearing body warn cameras I think
 
05:19:05.708 --> 05:19:05.718 align:start position:0%
under the current statute there's
 
05:19:07.990 --> 05:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
nothing that would prevent fishing game
 
05:19:10.590 --> 05:19:10.600 align:start position:0%
from equipping its conservation officers
 
05:19:13.070 --> 05:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
with body warn cameras this bill would
 
05:19:15.350 --> 05:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
make it mandatory that fishing game
 
05:19:17.910 --> 05:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
officers have body warn cameras and it's
 
05:19:19.270 --> 05:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
worth noting that that would make
 
05:19:22.030 --> 05:19:22.040 align:start position:0%
fishing game the only agency in the
 
05:19:23.670 --> 05:19:23.680 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire that's mandated
 
05:19:26.270 --> 05:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
to use bodyw warn cameras uh right now
 
05:19:27.948 --> 05:19:27.958 align:start position:0%
the state police are using body warn
 
05:19:29.590 --> 05:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
cameras but there's no mandate that they
 
05:19:31.270 --> 05:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
use them a number of local police
 
05:19:33.070 --> 05:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
departments use them but there's no
 
05:19:35.310 --> 05:19:35.320 align:start position:0%
mandates that any of those agencies use
 
05:19:36.470 --> 05:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
body warn
 
05:19:36.480 --> 05:19:38.190 align:start position:0%
body warn
cameras

05:19:38.190 --> 05:19:38.200 align:start position:0%
cameras
 
05:19:40.430 --> 05:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
because really it's a policy of whether
 
05:19:42.270 --> 05:19:42.280 align:start position:0%
or not fishing game should be using body
 
05:19:44.830 --> 05:19:44.840 align:start position:0%
warn cameras I I would suggest that
 
05:19:47.270 --> 05:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
instead of looking at 105 D2 that
 
05:19:49.590 --> 05:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
comprehensive statute instead of
 
05:19:51.390 --> 05:19:51.400 align:start position:0%
amending that it might make more sense
 
05:19:53.070 --> 05:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
to put something in
 
05:19:55.470 --> 05:19:55.480 align:start position:0%
20625 where it actually talks about the
 
05:19:57.788 --> 05:19:57.798 align:start position:0%
power of conservation officers or
 
05:19:59.948 --> 05:19:59.958 align:start position:0%
fishing game officers and I think
 
05:20:01.990 --> 05:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
frankly to the extent you wanted a
 
05:20:03.510 --> 05:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
policy that fishing game used body
 
05:20:04.788 --> 05:20:04.798 align:start position:0%
wearing cameras you could put a one-
 
05:20:06.628 --> 05:20:06.638 align:start position:0%
sentence Statute in there that says
 
05:20:09.150 --> 05:20:09.160 align:start position:0%
fishing game is authorized to equip its
 
05:20:10.708 --> 05:20:10.718 align:start position:0%
conservation officers with bodyw warn
 
05:20:14.270 --> 05:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
cameras um in compliance with 105
 
05:20:18.110 --> 05:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
D2 what concerns me about this bill is
 
05:20:21.670 --> 05:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
the reference to Discovery in um
 
05:20:23.830 --> 05:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
sentences 14-
 
05:20:28.230 --> 05:20:28.240 align:start position:0%
16 again when we talk about body warn
 
05:20:32.150 --> 05:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
camera videos it's without getting into
 
05:20:34.750 --> 05:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of detail it's worth realizing
 
05:20:37.310 --> 05:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
that there's more on those videos than
 
05:20:39.750 --> 05:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
just police officers and defendants
 
05:20:41.948 --> 05:20:41.958 align:start position:0%
there's Witnesses there's
 
05:20:45.310 --> 05:20:45.320 align:start position:0%
victims um if the police come to my
 
05:20:47.190 --> 05:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
house and say hey can we talk to you
 
05:20:48.788 --> 05:20:48.798 align:start position:0%
about you know your neighbor doing
 
05:20:51.230 --> 05:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
something I may ask them into my house
 
05:20:53.510 --> 05:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
and now there's a recording of the
 
05:20:55.310 --> 05:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
inside of my house and me speaking to
 
05:20:57.310 --> 05:20:57.320 align:start position:0%
the police one of the things that the
 
05:20:58.788 --> 05:20:58.798 align:start position:0%
police often do whenever they talk to
 
05:21:00.190 --> 05:21:00.200 align:start position:0%
anyone is they get that person's full
 
05:21:01.750 --> 05:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
name they get their data birth they get
 
05:21:03.390 --> 05:21:03.400 align:start position:0%
their address all that's captured on the
 
05:21:06.070 --> 05:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
body warn camera uh when you think about
 
05:21:07.990 --> 05:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
victims of domestic violence when the
 
05:21:09.990 --> 05:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
police arrive you may see people with
 
05:21:13.750 --> 05:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
bruises bleeding um and essentially we
 
05:21:15.750 --> 05:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
all recognize that the police generally
 
05:21:17.788 --> 05:21:17.798 align:start position:0%
aren't interacting with people on the
 
05:21:19.910 --> 05:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
best day of their life that this is
 
05:21:23.270 --> 05:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
often the worst time that this person's
 
05:21:25.830 --> 05:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
having you also have to bear in mind
 
05:21:27.310 --> 05:21:27.320 align:start position:0%
police are interacting with people that
 
05:21:30.590 --> 05:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
are in Mental Health crisis that are on
 
05:21:32.590 --> 05:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
on drug drugs or alcohol having those
 
05:21:35.628 --> 05:21:35.638 align:start position:0%
types of crisises and again if I could
 
05:21:37.548 --> 05:21:37.558 align:start position:0%
stop you just for a second yes we're
 
05:21:39.270 --> 05:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
drifting a lot into what police are
 
05:21:41.150 --> 05:21:41.160 align:start position:0%
doing and not so much into what the
 
05:21:43.390 --> 05:21:43.400 align:start position:0%
fishing game officers are doing on it
 
05:21:45.030 --> 05:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
fishing game is limited in its
 
05:21:47.430 --> 05:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
interactions on police details to just
 
05:21:51.548 --> 05:21:51.558 align:start position:0%
the DMV area under 207 how so the rest
 
05:21:53.310 --> 05:21:53.320 align:start position:0%
of that is what they might encounter in
 
05:21:55.070 --> 05:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
the field correct they're not doing
 
05:21:56.628 --> 05:21:56.638 align:start position:0%
mental health checks if we could just
 
05:21:58.230 --> 05:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
rein this in a little especially since
 
05:21:59.830 --> 05:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
we're running behind and the reason I
 
05:22:02.830 --> 05:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
bring all that up is because this bill
 
05:22:05.470 --> 05:22:05.480 align:start position:0%
amends discovery not just for fish and
 
05:22:08.430 --> 05:22:08.440 align:start position:0%
game but for all law enforcement in the
 
05:22:09.708 --> 05:22:09.718 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire that are using
 
05:22:12.750 --> 05:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
body Waring cameras so this would allow
 
05:22:14.470 --> 05:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
all law enforcement in the state of New
 
05:22:17.270 --> 05:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire using body warn cameras to
 
05:22:19.350 --> 05:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
duplicate that recording and provide it
 
05:22:21.548 --> 05:22:21.558 align:start position:0%
to the defendant with no privacy
 
05:22:24.670 --> 05:22:24.680 align:start position:0%
protections whatsoever it goes well well
 
05:22:27.310 --> 05:22:27.320 align:start position:0%
beyond fishing game and that's my
 
05:22:31.310 --> 05:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
concern is that you're amending 105 D2 a
 
05:22:34.230 --> 05:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
bill that covers all law enforcement in
 
05:22:36.990 --> 05:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
this one bill there are currently bills
 
05:22:39.310 --> 05:22:39.320 align:start position:0%
before the Senate and the house there's
 
05:22:42.948 --> 05:22:42.958 align:start position:0%
a Senate Bill 362 and a house bill 1021
 
05:22:45.030 --> 05:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
that specifically deal with discovery of
 
05:22:47.750 --> 05:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
body warn cameras that are going through
 
05:22:49.750 --> 05:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
the Senate Judiciary and house criminal
 
05:22:53.628 --> 05:22:53.638 align:start position:0%
justice committee with reference to the
 
05:22:56.548 --> 05:22:56.558 align:start position:0%
the teaching and interacting sections of
 
05:22:56.558 --> 05:22:58.948 align:start position:0%
the teaching and interacting sections of
this

05:22:58.948 --> 05:22:58.958 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:23:02.110 --> 05:23:02.120 align:start position:0%
um this proposal
 
05:23:05.830 --> 05:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
those sections are amendments to the
 
05:23:09.230 --> 05:23:09.240 align:start position:0%
retention statute so again when I talked
 
05:23:11.390 --> 05:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
about 105 D2 and I said the first part
 
05:23:14.390 --> 05:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
talks about the creation of body warn
 
05:23:16.750 --> 05:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
cameras to the extent you want Hunter
 
05:23:19.150 --> 05:23:19.160 align:start position:0%
education classes or interactions with
 
05:23:21.590 --> 05:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
Sportsman recorded that shouldn't be in
 
05:23:23.510 --> 05:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
the retention section that should be in
 
05:23:26.350 --> 05:23:26.360 align:start position:0%
the creation section because right now
 
05:23:28.470 --> 05:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
under 105
 
05:23:32.590 --> 05:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
D2 um police are
 
05:23:35.910 --> 05:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
prohibited from indiscriminately
 
05:23:39.110 --> 05:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
recording entire duties or patrols the
 
05:23:42.750 --> 05:23:42.760 align:start position:0%
police are only able to record on the
 
05:23:46.830 --> 05:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
arrival on arrival on scene for a call
 
05:23:48.390 --> 05:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
for service or when engaged in law
 
05:23:50.270 --> 05:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement related encounters or
 
05:23:52.470 --> 05:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
activities and that law enforcement
 
05:23:54.470 --> 05:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
related encounter activity is further
 
05:23:58.030 --> 05:23:58.040 align:start position:0%
defined in 105 D1 and specifically
 
05:24:01.470 --> 05:24:01.480 align:start position:0%
excludes Community caretaking functions
 
05:24:04.750 --> 05:24:04.760 align:start position:0%
so law enforcement when participating in
 
05:24:06.788 --> 05:24:06.798 align:start position:0%
town halls or community outreach helping
 
05:24:09.868 --> 05:24:09.878 align:start position:0%
a child find his parents providing death
 
05:24:11.948 --> 05:24:11.958 align:start position:0%
notifications dealing with individuals
 
05:24:13.350 --> 05:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
asking for directions or other
 
05:24:15.830 --> 05:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
assistance performing inhome or Hospital
 
05:24:17.670 --> 05:24:17.680 align:start position:0%
well-being checks on the sick elderly or
 
05:24:20.110 --> 05:24:20.120 align:start position:0%
persons presume missing are not allowed
 
05:24:21.990 --> 05:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
to record those interactions under
 
05:24:27.030 --> 05:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
current state law so to answer uh
 
05:24:29.350 --> 05:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
representative I think it was parr's
 
05:24:32.070 --> 05:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
question under current law the police
 
05:24:34.830 --> 05:24:34.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to record dare classes
 
05:24:36.110 --> 05:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
or anything like that and that would
 
05:24:37.310 --> 05:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
actually be
 
05:24:40.750 --> 05:24:40.760 align:start position:0%
prohibited uh so you have this weird
 
05:24:44.708 --> 05:24:44.718 align:start position:0%
thing in this bill where if you did pass
 
05:24:47.670 --> 05:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
this bill fishing game in my opinion
 
05:24:48.750 --> 05:24:48.760 align:start position:0%
would be
 
05:24:52.350 --> 05:24:52.360 align:start position:0%
prohibited from videotaping with body
 
05:24:55.548 --> 05:24:55.558 align:start position:0%
Waring cameras these Hunter Safety
 
05:24:57.708 --> 05:24:57.718 align:start position:0%
Classes but to the extent they did
 
05:24:59.310 --> 05:24:59.320 align:start position:0%
they'd have to retain that video for
 
05:25:01.948 --> 05:25:01.958 align:start position:0%
three years and I certainly think 's you
 
05:25:03.150 --> 05:25:03.160 align:start position:0%
know we talked a little bit about
 
05:25:05.190 --> 05:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
privacy but there's a lot of policy
 
05:25:07.430 --> 05:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
reasons why you may not want a class
 
05:25:10.708 --> 05:25:10.718 align:start position:0%
recorded in terms of I know I like to
 
05:25:12.910 --> 05:25:12.920 align:start position:0%
ask dumb questions when I was in school
 
05:25:15.390 --> 05:25:15.400 align:start position:0%
and I would have probably not done that
 
05:25:16.510 --> 05:25:16.520 align:start position:0%
had there been someone there with a
 
05:25:18.430 --> 05:25:18.440 align:start position:0%
video camera saying we're going to
 
05:25:20.310 --> 05:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
memorialize your stupidity for a number
 
05:25:24.470 --> 05:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
of years um so I think under the current
 
05:25:26.030 --> 05:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
statute you'd actually be prohibited
 
05:25:29.190 --> 05:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
from indiscriminately recording um and
 
05:25:30.990 --> 05:25:31.000 align:start position:0%
again those are my concerns with the
 
05:25:33.430 --> 05:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
current bill I don't know if you had
 
05:25:35.310 --> 05:25:35.320 align:start position:0%
anything to
 
05:25:38.470 --> 05:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
add good afternoon thank
 
05:25:43.110 --> 05:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
you the only comments I would add um are
 
05:25:45.670 --> 05:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
uh you mentioned uh chair Mr chairman
 
05:25:48.788 --> 05:25:48.798 align:start position:0%
that that um conservation officers uh I
 
05:25:50.830 --> 05:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
don't think any Court in New Hampshire
 
05:25:52.750 --> 05:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
would say that a conservation officer is
 
05:25:55.030 --> 05:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
not a law enforcement officer and I
 
05:25:57.590 --> 05:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
think that should they elect by internal
 
05:26:01.190 --> 05:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
policy or by uh subsequent statutory
 
05:26:04.470 --> 05:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
mandates to have body warant cameras um
 
05:26:07.430 --> 05:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
rest assured that they are going to have
 
05:26:10.670 --> 05:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
uh DWIs domestic violence cases uh use
 
05:26:13.270 --> 05:26:13.280 align:start position:0%
of force issues because they do back up
 
05:26:14.670 --> 05:26:14.680 align:start position:0%
local law enforcement I think Colonel
 
05:26:16.470 --> 05:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
Jordan can elaborate more on that than
 
05:26:18.628 --> 05:26:18.638 align:start position:0%
than I do because uh uh he obviously
 
05:26:21.030 --> 05:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
knows more about his daily operations
 
05:26:25.190 --> 05:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
than than than I um my big concern like
 
05:26:26.670 --> 05:26:26.680 align:start position:0%
attorney Andis as attorney endress
 
05:26:29.590 --> 05:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned was the current
 
05:26:33.270 --> 05:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
recommendations page one line 14 15 16
 
05:26:34.548 --> 05:26:34.558 align:start position:0%
has no
 
05:26:38.430 --> 05:26:38.440 align:start position:0%
limitations on privacy absolutely none
 
05:26:40.670 --> 05:26:40.680 align:start position:0%
and in recent testimony a representative
 
05:26:42.868 --> 05:26:42.878 align:start position:0%
asked me in one of the other hearings
 
05:26:44.350 --> 05:26:44.360 align:start position:0%
that without those privacy I'm
 
05:26:46.030 --> 05:26:46.040 align:start position:0%
paraphrasing our conversation without
 
05:26:49.150 --> 05:26:49.160 align:start position:0%
those privacy protections would I let uh
 
05:26:50.788 --> 05:26:50.798 align:start position:0%
would I let a police officer into my
 
05:26:55.150 --> 05:26:55.160 align:start position:0%
house and I told him absolutely not
 
05:27:00.590 --> 05:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
because um if you're a benign involve so
 
05:27:02.708 --> 05:27:02.718 align:start position:0%
someone wrecked a car at the bottom of
 
05:27:05.070 --> 05:27:05.080 align:start position:0%
your driveway hit your your mailbox and
 
05:27:07.310 --> 05:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
now the police officer comes up to you
 
05:27:08.830 --> 05:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
what's your name date of birth phone
 
05:27:10.910 --> 05:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
number all those personal type of
 
05:27:12.910 --> 05:27:12.920 align:start position:0%
information and it's raining outside
 
05:27:14.350 --> 05:27:14.360 align:start position:0%
you're going to invite them in inside to
 
05:27:17.510 --> 05:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
your house if if for some reason he
 
05:27:19.948 --> 05:27:19.958 align:start position:0%
continues to record which is a default
 
05:27:22.470 --> 05:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
setting the entire part of your house
 
05:27:23.868 --> 05:27:23.878 align:start position:0%
without privacy
 
05:27:26.190 --> 05:27:26.200 align:start position:0%
protections someone's going to monetize
 
05:27:28.430 --> 05:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
that someone's going to put it on
 
05:27:32.910 --> 05:27:32.920 align:start position:0%
Facebook um on in DV cases um uh without
 
05:27:34.910 --> 05:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
any protections and qualifications for
 
05:27:37.430 --> 05:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
release of that information to
 
05:27:41.150 --> 05:27:41.160 align:start position:0%
defendants um you risk having no
 
05:27:43.230 --> 05:27:43.240 align:start position:0%
protection for a victim of domestic
 
05:27:46.868 --> 05:27:46.878 align:start position:0%
violence um their their perpetrator
 
05:27:50.788 --> 05:27:50.798 align:start position:0%
editing that V that that body War camera
 
05:27:53.548 --> 05:27:53.558 align:start position:0%
m material posting it on YouTube to the
 
05:27:54.990 --> 05:27:55.000 align:start position:0%
detriment of the domestic violence
 
05:27:57.628 --> 05:27:57.638 align:start position:0%
victim those are our concerns um those
 
05:27:58.788 --> 05:27:58.798 align:start position:0%
are addressed in some the other
 
05:28:01.270 --> 05:28:01.280 align:start position:0%
legislation that's that's currently pen
 
05:28:03.708 --> 05:28:03.718 align:start position:0%
um so on for those reasons and the ones
 
05:28:05.708 --> 05:28:05.718 align:start position:0%
mentioned by attorney Andress uh I would
 
05:28:08.430 --> 05:28:08.440 align:start position:0%
recommend that this bill be uh
 
05:28:10.590 --> 05:28:10.600 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate and I think
 
05:28:12.110 --> 05:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
we'll both answer any questions that you
 
05:28:13.310 --> 05:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
may have
 
05:28:16.230 --> 05:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
question thank you thank you are there
 
05:28:18.670 --> 05:28:18.680 align:start position:0%
any questions representative
 
05:28:22.110 --> 05:28:22.120 align:start position:0%
Harvey so so that's what kind of what I
 
05:28:26.670 --> 05:28:26.680 align:start position:0%
was alluding to and on a much smaller
 
05:28:29.230 --> 05:28:29.240 align:start position:0%
basis and corre and I'm going to ask you
 
05:28:30.868 --> 05:28:30.878 align:start position:0%
my question is please correct me if I'm
 
05:28:34.230 --> 05:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
wrong one of the things the um you know
 
05:28:37.230 --> 05:28:37.240 align:start position:0%
the uh Commissioners do is take us all
 
05:28:40.270 --> 05:28:40.280 align:start position:0%
on field trips I'm very careful not to
 
05:28:42.990 --> 05:28:43.000 align:start position:0%
put on Facebook or anywhere whe when I'm
 
05:28:45.830 --> 05:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
not home I don't want them to know that
 
05:28:48.230 --> 05:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
anyone to know when I'm not home and so
 
05:28:49.990 --> 05:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
if he were wearing a body camera and
 
05:28:52.510 --> 05:28:52.520 align:start position:0%
there's Cathy Harvey at the powder mail
 
05:28:56.948 --> 05:28:56.958 align:start position:0%
Fish Hatchery that could be um that
 
05:29:01.310 --> 05:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
could be recorded that I'm not home for
 
05:29:04.670 --> 05:29:04.680 align:start position:0%
that day or or whatever and so that's
 
05:29:06.230 --> 05:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
what I was alluding to and I didn't do
 
05:29:10.150 --> 05:29:10.160 align:start position:0%
it well enough but am I correct in it
 
05:29:11.750 --> 05:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
would certainly memorialize you were
 
05:29:13.948 --> 05:29:13.958 align:start position:0%
there I don't know that it would sort of
 
05:29:15.990 --> 05:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
live stream that you weren't home at
 
05:29:19.510 --> 05:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
that very moment but if someone sought a
 
05:29:20.948 --> 05:29:20.958 align:start position:0%
copy of that video in the future they
 
05:29:26.510 --> 05:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:29.310 --> 05:29:29.320 align:start position:0%
time thank you and uh representative
 
05:29:29.320 --> 05:29:31.788 align:start position:0%
time thank you and uh representative
Ford

05:29:31.788 --> 05:29:31.798 align:start position:0%
Ford
 
05:29:34.470 --> 05:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um you said
 
05:29:37.510 --> 05:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
something and I I I got caught up on it
 
05:29:40.190 --> 05:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
which probably I shouldn't have done but
 
05:29:42.310 --> 05:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
you said um
 
05:29:45.990 --> 05:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
legally um to the effect of most people
 
05:29:48.070 --> 05:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
would consider our fish and gang
 
05:29:50.270 --> 05:29:50.280 align:start position:0%
conservation officers the same as law
 
05:29:51.868 --> 05:29:51.878 align:start position:0%
enforcement also state trooper local
 
05:29:55.390 --> 05:29:55.400 align:start position:0%
police and I I I would imagine that the
 
05:29:56.708 --> 05:29:56.718 align:start position:0%
representative who was sponsoring this
 
05:30:00.070 --> 05:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
bill thought about that actual phrasing
 
05:30:01.830 --> 05:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
and being a part of this committee I do
 
05:30:03.750 --> 05:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
know that conservation officers do
 
05:30:05.270 --> 05:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
support our state troopers and other
 
05:30:07.430 --> 05:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
efforts and we definitely need to grow
 
05:30:08.830 --> 05:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
their budget to make sure they are doing
 
05:30:10.110 --> 05:30:10.120 align:start position:0%
that safely and with the numbers they
 
05:30:13.190 --> 05:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
need but I'm just wondering
 
05:30:15.628 --> 05:30:15.638 align:start position:0%
legally do we do we consider our
 
05:30:17.470 --> 05:30:17.480 align:start position:0%
conservation officers the same as Law
 
05:30:20.110 --> 05:30:20.120 align:start position:0%
Enforcement Officers um because I would
 
05:30:22.510 --> 05:30:22.520 align:start position:0%
imagine that the you sponsor of this
 
05:30:24.070 --> 05:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
bill Prime sponsor this bill is doing it
 
05:30:26.430 --> 05:30:26.440 align:start position:0%
because the conservation officers aren't
 
05:30:28.470 --> 05:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
listed to the general public and
 
05:30:31.430 --> 05:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
otherwise as law enforcement officers
 
05:30:33.270 --> 05:30:33.280 align:start position:0%
and so body cameras wouldn't necessarily
 
05:30:35.110 --> 05:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
be applied to them in the same manner
 
05:30:37.430 --> 05:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
and and I agree that I think that is
 
05:30:40.230 --> 05:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
part of the motivation for for the the
 
05:30:46.030 --> 05:30:46.040 align:start position:0%
bill looking at 105 D1 section five it
 
05:30:48.350 --> 05:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
defines there sections four and five
 
05:30:50.230 --> 05:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
defined law enforcement officer and law
 
05:30:50.240 --> 05:30:51.868 align:start position:0%
defined law enforcement officer and law
enforcement

05:30:51.868 --> 05:30:51.878 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
05:30:54.430 --> 05:30:54.440 align:start position:0%
agency I I didn't write these
 
05:30:56.230 --> 05:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
definitions and I could be happier with
 
05:30:58.510 --> 05:30:58.520 align:start position:0%
them if I wrote them myself but a law
 
05:31:00.190 --> 05:31:00.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer means any person
 
05:31:02.590 --> 05:31:02.600 align:start position:0%
employed by a law enforcement agency I
 
05:31:05.390 --> 05:31:05.400 align:start position:0%
think that's a a horrible definition but
 
05:31:07.788 --> 05:31:07.798 align:start position:0%
that's what that's what's written um law
 
05:31:10.030 --> 05:31:10.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency means a state county
 
05:31:12.110 --> 05:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
municipality Special Districts security
 
05:31:14.548 --> 05:31:14.558 align:start position:0%

05:31:29.190 --> 05:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
employ law enforcement off officers or
 
05:31:31.670 --> 05:31:31.680 align:start position:0%
exercise police Authority Law
 
05:31:33.990 --> 05:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
Enforcement Officers is also defined in
 
05:31:36.670 --> 05:31:36.680 align:start position:0%
RSA 106 L2 which is the police standards
 
05:31:41.310 --> 05:31:41.320 align:start position:0%
and training Council um under 106 L2 a
 
05:31:42.948 --> 05:31:42.958 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officer is anyone
 
05:31:44.510 --> 05:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
employed by the state essentially that
 
05:31:46.868 --> 05:31:46.878 align:start position:0%
has powers of arrest and fits into other
 
05:31:51.510 --> 05:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
categories so I think without a doubt um
 
05:31:53.590 --> 05:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
at least in my mind conservation
 
05:31:55.670 --> 05:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
officers meet the definition of law
 
05:31:57.750 --> 05:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement I think for the purposes of
 
05:32:01.270 --> 05:32:01.280 align:start position:0%
both 105d as well as 106 to they are
 
05:32:02.628 --> 05:32:02.638 align:start position:0%
certified through police standards and
 
05:32:04.948 --> 05:32:04.958 align:start position:0%
training Council so I I think they do
 
05:32:10.708 --> 05:32:10.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:13.788 --> 05:32:13.798 align:start position:0%
already representative pair keep in mind
 
05:32:15.350 --> 05:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
we're running real late on time yeah
 
05:32:18.990 --> 05:32:19.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um you uh made one
 
05:32:21.990 --> 05:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
statement that you said uh if if this
 
05:32:24.070 --> 05:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
were were written you think it do you
 
05:32:27.310 --> 05:32:27.320 align:start position:0%
think that that statement would uh cover
 
05:32:30.030 --> 05:32:30.040 align:start position:0%
the intent of this legislation with
 
05:32:32.230 --> 05:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
without disrupting the existing
 
05:32:34.708 --> 05:32:34.718 align:start position:0%
legislation to the extent that that we
 
05:32:36.070 --> 05:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
have been
 
05:32:38.150 --> 05:32:38.160 align:start position:0%
discussing again I think if you want
 
05:32:39.990 --> 05:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
fishing game officers to wear bodyw warn
 
05:32:44.310 --> 05:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
cameras if you put a section in 20626
 
05:32:46.030 --> 05:32:46.040 align:start position:0%
saying that fishing game are authorized
 
05:32:48.030 --> 05:32:48.040 align:start position:0%
to to wear bodyw warn cameras or
 
05:32:49.390 --> 05:32:49.400 align:start position:0%
required to wear body warn cameras or
 
05:32:51.150 --> 05:32:51.160 align:start position:0%
whatever policy you want to do it would
 
05:32:53.070 --> 05:32:53.080 align:start position:0%
put fishing game in the same position
 
05:32:55.708 --> 05:32:55.718 align:start position:0%
following 105 D2 as all local Law
 
05:32:57.670 --> 05:32:57.680 align:start position:0%
Enforcement Officers as well as the
 
05:33:00.510 --> 05:33:00.520 align:start position:0%
state police which I assume would um
 
05:33:03.708 --> 05:33:03.718 align:start position:0%
cover what you essentially want to
 
05:33:07.430 --> 05:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
cover thank you thank you any other
 
05:33:09.548 --> 05:33:09.558 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
05:33:11.750 --> 05:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you thank you the chair
 
05:33:14.190 --> 05:33:14.200 align:start position:0%
now repes uh recognizes Penny Dean
 
05:33:16.390 --> 05:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
representing herself and you've asked
 
05:33:21.270 --> 05:33:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:23.230 --> 05:33:23.240 align:start position:0%
minutes let's hope we can keep it
 
05:33:26.270 --> 05:33:26.280 align:start position:0%
shorter we are on a hard stop at 4:30 so
 
05:33:27.948 --> 05:33:27.958 align:start position:0%
that we don't have to call our staff to
 
05:33:28.948 --> 05:33:28.958 align:start position:0%
go do
 
05:33:28.958 --> 05:33:38.670 align:start position:0%
go do
overtime

05:33:38.670 --> 05:33:38.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:58.868 --> 05:33:58.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:58.878 --> 05:34:01.190 align:start position:0%
 
today

05:34:01.190 --> 05:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:34:03.230 --> 05:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
I hope they're
 
05:34:07.110 --> 05:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
identical um one is missing the last few
 
05:34:21.310 --> 05:34:21.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:24.590 --> 05:34:24.600 align:start position:0%
numbers there's quite a bit of
 
05:34:28.868 --> 05:34:28.878 align:start position:0%
information um yes
 
05:34:28.878 --> 05:34:53.910 align:start position:0%
information um yes
please

05:34:53.910 --> 05:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:56.628 --> 05:34:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:59.310 --> 05:34:59.320 align:start position:0%
is my name is p you can go ahead Penny
 
05:35:01.350 --> 05:35:01.360 align:start position:0%
oh sorry
 
05:35:03.150 --> 05:35:03.160 align:start position:0%
my name is Penny
 
05:35:06.708 --> 05:35:06.718 align:start position:0%
Dean I've lived in New Hampshire since
 
05:35:09.948 --> 05:35:09.958 align:start position:0%
1995 and I'm an attorney I'm admitted in
 
05:35:12.350 --> 05:35:12.360 align:start position:0%
Maine New Hampshire
 
05:35:14.670 --> 05:35:14.680 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts DC circuit all of the
 
05:35:16.310 --> 05:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
federal courts the First Circuit Court
 
05:35:20.788 --> 05:35:20.798 align:start position:0%
of Appeals US Supreme Court and I'm a
 
05:35:24.910 --> 05:35:24.920 align:start position:0%
litigator and I defend Sportsmen on a
 
05:35:27.070 --> 05:35:27.080 align:start position:0%
regular basis and
 
05:35:29.350 --> 05:35:29.360 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I defend them usually in
 
05:35:31.270 --> 05:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
cases where they have been not treated
 
05:35:32.830 --> 05:35:32.840 align:start position:0%
well by fishing
 
05:35:36.750 --> 05:35:36.760 align:start position:0%
game and I tell people that I'm not your
 
05:35:38.628 --> 05:35:38.638 align:start position:0%
typical criminal defense attorney I have
 
05:35:41.350 --> 05:35:41.360 align:start position:0%
a home office if you tell most criminal
 
05:35:43.310 --> 05:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
defense attorneys that their clients
 
05:35:44.708 --> 05:35:44.718 align:start position:0%
would know where they live let alone
 
05:35:46.750 --> 05:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
have a home office they would have
 
05:35:49.270 --> 05:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
kittens I let them in my house they're
 
05:35:50.788 --> 05:35:50.798 align:start position:0%
not criminals they're people charged
 
05:35:52.510 --> 05:35:52.520 align:start position:0%
with a criminal act but they're not
 
05:35:54.110 --> 05:35:54.120 align:start position:0%
criminals there's a
 
05:35:57.990 --> 05:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
difference this bill is sorely needed
 
05:36:00.270 --> 05:36:00.280 align:start position:0%
and there's a reason for the three-year
 
05:36:03.270 --> 05:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
attention most violations have a 90day
 
05:36:05.910 --> 05:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
statute of limitations the fishing game
 
05:36:07.830 --> 05:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
in many areas is treated special for
 
05:36:09.788 --> 05:36:09.798 align:start position:0%
three-year statute limitations for many
 
05:36:12.350 --> 05:36:12.360 align:start position:0%
things and so that is why the reason for
 
05:36:16.470 --> 05:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
the three-year retention it isn't just
 
05:36:18.990 --> 05:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
arbitrary I have wanted this bill for
 
05:36:22.470 --> 05:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
fishing game forever because just like
 
05:36:25.750 --> 05:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
any law enforcement the truth will stand
 
05:36:27.948 --> 05:36:27.958 align:start position:0%
when hell's on fire and if you have a
 
05:36:30.190 --> 05:36:30.200 align:start position:0%
recording you don't have to have a he
 
05:36:31.868 --> 05:36:31.878 align:start position:0%
said he said we can look at the
 
05:36:34.708 --> 05:36:34.718 align:start position:0%
recording and see who said what and see
 
05:36:37.310 --> 05:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
what happened and that's fairness to
 
05:36:39.510 --> 05:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
people not everybody can afford an
 
05:36:41.628 --> 05:36:41.638 align:start position:0%
attorney so you see a lot of people
 
05:36:43.430 --> 05:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
pleading out in fishing game cases
 
05:36:45.110 --> 05:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
because a lot of them were violations
 
05:36:47.230 --> 05:36:47.240 align:start position:0%
because they can't afford an attorney
 
05:36:48.910 --> 05:36:48.920 align:start position:0%
and it breaks my
 
05:36:51.670 --> 05:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
heart but this case here is more
 
05:36:54.750 --> 05:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
personal than ever to me I was and I say
 
05:36:57.110 --> 05:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
was because I'm challenging my hunter
 
05:36:59.868 --> 05:36:59.878 align:start position:0%
education decertification if you will a
 
05:37:02.788 --> 05:37:02.798 align:start position:0%
hunter education instructor for 17
 
05:37:05.430 --> 05:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
years and I love teaching Hunter
 
05:37:07.150 --> 05:37:07.160 align:start position:0%
education and contrary to what most
 
05:37:09.310 --> 05:37:09.320 align:start position:0%
people think and I didn't bring the
 
05:37:11.390 --> 05:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
stats with me so I would have to look at
 
05:37:13.270 --> 05:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
the stats I can just tell you my classes
 
05:37:15.868 --> 05:37:15.878 align:start position:0%
the last class that I recall teaching
 
05:37:18.470 --> 05:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
there's more adults in it than quote
 
05:37:21.030 --> 05:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
children so when you talk about these
 
05:37:24.470 --> 05:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
cameras recording people the depending
 
05:37:27.230 --> 05:37:27.240 align:start position:0%
on the class they're recording a lot of
 
05:37:30.830 --> 05:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
adults but I think the larger issue here
 
05:37:32.670 --> 05:37:32.680 align:start position:0%
and what brings me to support this more
 
05:37:34.670 --> 05:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
than ever I always support it for my
 
05:37:38.470 --> 05:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
clients but the bottom line
 
05:37:41.670 --> 05:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
is that these conservation officers they
 
05:37:44.910 --> 05:37:44.920 align:start position:0%
when they give their one hour Spiel I am
 
05:37:46.788 --> 05:37:46.798 align:start position:0%
usually the only Hunter education
 
05:37:48.830 --> 05:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
instructor that stays in the room
 
05:37:50.430 --> 05:37:50.440 align:start position:0%
usually all the others take a break
 
05:37:52.150 --> 05:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
because they're quite frankly not
 
05:37:54.310 --> 05:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
interested I'm very interested because
 
05:37:56.628 --> 05:37:56.638 align:start position:0%
I'm interested in the law but more
 
05:37:58.590 --> 05:37:58.600 align:start position:0%
importantly I'm interested because the
 
05:38:00.708 --> 05:38:00.718 align:start position:0%
vast majority the time there's blood
 
05:38:02.628 --> 05:38:02.638 align:start position:0%
dripping out of the front of my lips
 
05:38:05.430 --> 05:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
because I'm biting my tongue because
 
05:38:08.868 --> 05:38:08.878 align:start position:0%
what these students are being told is
 
05:38:10.310 --> 05:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
not correct in
 
05:38:13.470 --> 05:38:13.480 align:start position:0%
law and thereby people who are going to
 
05:38:16.390 --> 05:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
now you know charge these people these
 
05:38:19.150 --> 05:38:19.160 align:start position:0%
students and it's going to destroy our
 
05:38:21.750 --> 05:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
hunting Heritage so the numbers I'd like
 
05:38:23.708 --> 05:38:23.718 align:start position:0%
you to look at and I didn't wasn't able
 
05:38:24.830 --> 05:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
to get them printed today I have
 
05:38:27.510 --> 05:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
printing trouble is the amount of Hunter
 
05:38:30.270 --> 05:38:30.280 align:start position:0%
education students we pass every year
 
05:38:32.390 --> 05:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
and the amount of additional hunting
 
05:38:35.390 --> 05:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
licenses we get and I would say there's
 
05:38:37.310 --> 05:38:37.320 align:start position:0%
a big drop off and so you ask yourself
 
05:38:38.948 --> 05:38:38.958 align:start position:0%
why is that if they're motivated enough
 
05:38:41.430 --> 05:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
to take a hunter education class why
 
05:38:43.468 --> 05:38:43.478 align:start position:0%
aren't we getting more
 
05:38:45.910 --> 05:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
hunters and I think that's a good
 
05:38:49.948 --> 05:38:49.958 align:start position:0%
question I can tell you anecdotal
 
05:38:52.390 --> 05:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
evidence but it's because of how people
 
05:38:55.990 --> 05:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
are treated and the things that are said
 
05:38:58.030 --> 05:38:58.040 align:start position:0%
and the conservation officers when they
 
05:39:00.310 --> 05:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
are in that one hour with students
 
05:39:02.948 --> 05:39:02.958 align:start position:0%
absolutely needs to be recorded because
 
05:39:05.310 --> 05:39:05.320 align:start position:0%
they are telling students policies of
 
05:39:07.868 --> 05:39:07.878 align:start position:0%
Fish and Game of the law of how they're
 
05:39:09.468 --> 05:39:09.478 align:start position:0%
going to be treated of what the
 
05:39:11.750 --> 05:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
consequences are for certain things
 
05:39:13.948 --> 05:39:13.958 align:start position:0%
those students are relying on that they
 
05:39:15.788 --> 05:39:15.798 align:start position:0%
see a conservation officer a state
 
05:39:18.070 --> 05:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
officer police officer in uniform
 
05:39:19.948 --> 05:39:19.958 align:start position:0%
telling them this is how we interpret
 
05:39:21.830 --> 05:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
this law this is how we interpret that
 
05:39:24.868 --> 05:39:24.878 align:start position:0%
law and I'm sure you know because of
 
05:39:27.110 --> 05:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
your job that when you read the statute
 
05:39:29.110 --> 05:39:29.120 align:start position:0%
books and the law books there sometimes
 
05:39:32.110 --> 05:39:32.120 align:start position:0%
as clear as mud and you have to look to
 
05:39:34.230 --> 05:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
antidotes or legislative history and say
 
05:39:36.628 --> 05:39:36.638 align:start position:0%
how is this going to be interpreted
 
05:39:38.590 --> 05:39:38.600 align:start position:0%
what's what's it going to mean what's it
 
05:39:41.590 --> 05:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
mean and these students are the same and
 
05:39:44.150 --> 05:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
what brings me here today was a
 
05:39:46.350 --> 05:39:46.360 align:start position:0%
particular class that I was as I said
 
05:39:48.030 --> 05:39:48.040 align:start position:0%
all the other instructors almost always
 
05:39:52.110 --> 05:39:52.120 align:start position:0%
go out I set in and I set in in a class
 
05:39:55.590 --> 05:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
on lake wiip pasak and what's important
 
05:39:58.430 --> 05:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
for you to know in how I was treated
 
05:40:00.150 --> 05:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
because if I've been treated this way
 
05:40:01.750 --> 05:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm not a woman that lays down and
 
05:40:04.070 --> 05:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
gets treated bad without saying I'm
 
05:40:06.468 --> 05:40:06.478 align:start position:0%
going to stand up for myself how many
 
05:40:08.670 --> 05:40:08.680 align:start position:0%
other Hunter education instructors have
 
05:40:10.708 --> 05:40:10.718 align:start position:0%
been treated this way and told to shut
 
05:40:12.628 --> 05:40:12.638 align:start position:0%
up and stand down and they get the
 
05:40:14.830 --> 05:40:14.840 align:start position:0%
message and especially women because we
 
05:40:16.350 --> 05:40:16.360 align:start position:0%
got to know our
 
05:40:18.670 --> 05:40:18.680 align:start position:0%
place and somehow or other I always
 
05:40:20.350 --> 05:40:20.360 align:start position:0%
thought my place was in the house and in
 
05:40:23.628 --> 05:40:23.638 align:start position:0%
the Senate not just the house and so you
 
05:40:26.910 --> 05:40:26.920 align:start position:0%
have here a class that I was in and I
 
05:40:29.270 --> 05:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
was an instructor and I'm sitting in the
 
05:40:30.788 --> 05:40:30.798 align:start position:0%
in the class the only instructor in the
 
05:40:33.110 --> 05:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
class and the conservation officer is
 
05:40:35.110 --> 05:40:35.120 align:start position:0%
answering a question from a young lady
 
05:40:36.548 --> 05:40:36.558 align:start position:0%
probably 30 years old in the front of
 
05:40:40.030 --> 05:40:40.040 align:start position:0%
the room and he is giving an
 
05:40:42.628 --> 05:40:42.638 align:start position:0%
interpretation about the 300 foot rule
 
05:40:44.548 --> 05:40:44.558 align:start position:0%
that's something I've never heard in my
 
05:40:47.830 --> 05:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
life before I said I'm thinking okay
 
05:40:49.390 --> 05:40:49.400 align:start position:0%
he's going to tell this person this
 
05:40:51.788 --> 05:40:51.798 align:start position:0%
they're going to rely on it and every
 
05:40:53.468 --> 05:40:53.478 align:start position:0%
person I've ever said's got arrested
 
05:40:57.190 --> 05:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
over it so I'm thinking so my question
 
05:40:59.548 --> 05:40:59.558 align:start position:0%
is when did Fish and Game Change CH
 
05:41:02.628 --> 05:41:02.638 align:start position:0%
their interpretation of how they're um
 
05:41:04.468 --> 05:41:04.478 align:start position:0%
enacting and how they're interpreting
 
05:41:08.390 --> 05:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:11.590 --> 05:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
building and I guess I asked too many
 
05:41:14.310 --> 05:41:14.320 align:start position:0%
questions um we have never been told
 
05:41:15.830 --> 05:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
I've never been told in nowhere in the
 
05:41:17.430 --> 05:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
rule book that if you're a hunter
 
05:41:19.468 --> 05:41:19.478 align:start position:0%
education instructor you can't ask
 
05:41:21.990 --> 05:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
questions of the conservation
 
05:41:25.510 --> 05:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
officer so I raised my hand standard
 
05:41:27.788 --> 05:41:27.798 align:start position:0%
thing to do asked a question nobody else
 
05:41:29.390 --> 05:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
in the class was asking questions other
 
05:41:32.590 --> 05:41:32.600 align:start position:0%
than this one young lady and I said when
 
05:41:34.390 --> 05:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
did fishing game change how they
 
05:41:36.190 --> 05:41:36.200 align:start position:0%
interpret that oh it's always been that
 
05:41:38.150 --> 05:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
way so I'm thinking well I've been
 
05:41:41.990 --> 05:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
practicing law for 25 years and it's
 
05:41:44.750 --> 05:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely always been opposite of that
 
05:41:46.548 --> 05:41:46.558 align:start position:0%
so I wait about 10 minutes and I raised
 
05:41:48.948 --> 05:41:48.958 align:start position:0%
my hand again and I said you know I'm a
 
05:41:50.910 --> 05:41:50.920 align:start position:0%
lawyer and I practice law and I'm
 
05:41:50.920 --> 05:41:52.468 align:start position:0%
lawyer and I practice law and I'm
confused

05:41:52.468 --> 05:41:52.478 align:start position:0%
confused
 
05:41:55.868 --> 05:41:55.878 align:start position:0%
here and because I'm concerned if again
 
05:41:57.270 --> 05:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
these students in the class are going to
 
05:41:58.510 --> 05:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
be listening to this they're going to be
 
05:42:01.390 --> 05:42:01.400 align:start position:0%
hearing this is how it's interpreted
 
05:42:05.430 --> 05:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
which is his version was house unlik
 
05:42:07.430 --> 05:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
winaki if you don't think anybody's
 
05:42:08.670 --> 05:42:08.680 align:start position:0%
there well it's not a permanently
 
05:42:09.990 --> 05:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
occupied dwelling you can shoot within
 
05:42:12.750 --> 05:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
300 feet of it that's not how I've ever
 
05:42:14.990 --> 05:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
seen it interpreted
 
05:42:18.910 --> 05:42:18.920 align:start position:0%
before and so I'm concerned about
 
05:42:21.868 --> 05:42:21.878 align:start position:0%
that well I go to the ladies room and it
 
05:42:23.310 --> 05:42:23.320 align:start position:0%
like Winn pasak that means there's an
 
05:42:25.910 --> 05:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
ous out back and I come out back and
 
05:42:28.150 --> 05:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
that conservation officer is waiting for
 
05:42:31.150 --> 05:42:31.160 align:start position:0%
me and I wish he would have had video on
 
05:42:32.990 --> 05:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
there because it's like a bad movie
 
05:42:35.150 --> 05:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
where I say I'm still trying to figure
 
05:42:36.948 --> 05:42:36.958 align:start position:0%
out and he gives me three different
 
05:42:39.270 --> 05:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
stories in five minutes first one was at
 
05:42:40.548 --> 05:42:40.558 align:start position:0%
it was at some big meeting of
 
05:42:42.350 --> 05:42:42.360 align:start position:0%
conservation officers I said well when
 
05:42:44.510 --> 05:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
was the meeting where was it how come I
 
05:42:46.030 --> 05:42:46.040 align:start position:0%
kind of have my not ear to the ground
 
05:42:48.070 --> 05:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
why didn't I hear about it then I got a
 
05:42:50.990 --> 05:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
different story and I and I said well
 
05:42:52.350 --> 05:42:52.360 align:start position:0%
can you just forward me the email you're
 
05:42:53.990 --> 05:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
talking about that's private fishing
 
05:42:56.070 --> 05:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
game information I said you're going to
 
05:42:58.230 --> 05:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
make me do a right to know if there's
 
05:42:59.670 --> 05:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
been a policy change
 
05:43:03.628 --> 05:43:03.638 align:start position:0%
change but the gist of it is this
 
05:43:06.510 --> 05:43:06.520 align:start position:0%
conservation officer took great umbrage
 
05:43:10.868 --> 05:43:10.878 align:start position:0%
to this and he made a complaint and what
 
05:43:13.510 --> 05:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
you have there is really important to
 
05:43:16.350 --> 05:43:16.360 align:start position:0%
know because again if I am being treated
 
05:43:19.830 --> 05:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
this way how many others have been and
 
05:43:22.628 --> 05:43:22.638 align:start position:0%
the other thing is over the years how
 
05:43:25.030 --> 05:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
many pedophiles or how many people who
 
05:43:28.070 --> 05:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
are not able to have guns were teaching
 
05:43:29.628 --> 05:43:29.638 align:start position:0%
these children because they weren't
 
05:43:32.590 --> 05:43:32.600 align:start position:0%
doing regular checks
 
05:43:36.110 --> 05:43:36.120 align:start position:0%
my fighting for my certification back
 
05:43:37.910 --> 05:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
has brought back important things but on
 
05:43:41.310 --> 05:43:41.320 align:start position:0%
January 5th of 2023 I received a page in
 
05:43:44.350 --> 05:43:44.360 align:start position:0%
a third letter from the executive
 
05:43:46.868 --> 05:43:46.878 align:start position:0%
director of fishing game here's what's
 
05:43:48.190 --> 05:43:48.200 align:start position:0%
important about that it's about a page
 
05:43:49.750 --> 05:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
and a third it's a very short letter
 
05:43:52.310 --> 05:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
it's in there for you in the very first
 
05:43:54.708 --> 05:43:54.718 align:start position:0%
paragraph it says there was an email
 
05:43:56.430 --> 05:43:56.440 align:start position:0%
from someone at the
 
05:43:59.708 --> 05:43:59.718 align:start position:0%
class so I said I want to see the email
 
05:44:01.590 --> 05:44:01.600 align:start position:0%
that's a reasonable question someone
 
05:44:03.190 --> 05:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
sent an email I'd like to see it very
 
05:44:05.230 --> 05:44:05.240 align:start position:0%
short letter very few things in
 
05:44:07.830 --> 05:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
it and when I got all the discovery
 
05:44:10.430 --> 05:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
first of all for five months they
 
05:44:11.910 --> 05:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
basically fought and fought and wouldn't
 
05:44:13.670 --> 05:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
give me the email you know why they
 
05:44:16.868 --> 05:44:16.878 align:start position:0%
wouldn't give me the email didn't exist
 
05:44:18.190 --> 05:44:18.200 align:start position:0%
never was
 
05:44:21.110 --> 05:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
one but here's what's worse about that
 
05:44:22.990 --> 05:44:23.000 align:start position:0%
if you read all the emails among
 
05:44:25.350 --> 05:44:25.360 align:start position:0%
themselves the documents that they were
 
05:44:27.910 --> 05:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
discussing four or five people top level
 
05:44:29.628 --> 05:44:29.638 align:start position:0%
fishing game
 
05:44:31.150 --> 05:44:31.160 align:start position:0%
did not list an
 
05:44:34.070 --> 05:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
email they knew from the beginning there
 
05:44:37.070 --> 05:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
wasn't an email they had to four or five
 
05:44:40.350 --> 05:44:40.360 align:start position:0%
people edited this letter over several
 
05:44:42.548 --> 05:44:42.558 align:start position:0%
weeks going back and forth they're all
 
05:44:44.590 --> 05:44:44.600 align:start position:0%
copying on it any one of them you would
 
05:44:46.628 --> 05:44:46.638 align:start position:0%
think in a short page in a third letter
 
05:44:47.468 --> 05:44:47.478 align:start position:0%
would say wait a minute we're
 
05:44:49.270 --> 05:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
referencing this email none of us
 
05:44:50.750 --> 05:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
referred to an email we don't have an
 
05:44:53.468 --> 05:44:53.478 align:start position:0%
email there must be a mistake and at
 
05:44:53.478 --> 05:44:54.350 align:start position:0%
email there must be a mistake and at
some

05:44:54.350 --> 05:44:54.360 align:start position:0%
some
 
05:44:57.868 --> 05:44:57.878 align:start position:0%
point when is there incompetence versus
 
05:44:59.990 --> 05:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
malevolence and I'll let you look at
 
05:45:01.990 --> 05:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
that paperwork and ask for it because
 
05:45:03.670 --> 05:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
why didn't when I first asked for it
 
05:45:05.350 --> 05:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
someone didn't say oh my God we made a
 
05:45:08.110 --> 05:45:08.120 align:start position:0%
horrible mistake there is no
 
05:45:10.708 --> 05:45:10.718 align:start position:0%
email and you go through it I've been
 
05:45:12.990 --> 05:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
litigating and most people consider me a
 
05:45:16.390 --> 05:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
pretty hard litigator for 25 years and
 
05:45:19.350 --> 05:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
in three months there's a stack of
 
05:45:22.750 --> 05:45:22.760 align:start position:0%
papers of of pleadings that I had to
 
05:45:24.548 --> 05:45:24.558 align:start position:0%
file trying to get documents that I
 
05:45:27.030 --> 05:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
should have been given freely that's
 
05:45:29.030 --> 05:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
taller than any sack in any case I've
 
05:45:29.040 --> 05:45:29.788 align:start position:0%
taller than any sack in any case I've
ever

05:45:29.788 --> 05:45:29.798 align:start position:0%
ever
 
05:45:32.948 --> 05:45:32.958 align:start position:0%
litigated for 3 to 5 months I basically
 
05:45:34.910 --> 05:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
couldn't take cases it was a full-time
 
05:45:38.510 --> 05:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
job and so I'm looking at this and I'm
 
05:45:41.030 --> 05:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
saying so I said what other Hunter
 
05:45:42.430 --> 05:45:42.440 align:start position:0%
education instructors have been
 
05:45:44.708 --> 05:45:44.718 align:start position:0%
dismissed in the past 10
 
05:45:47.830 --> 05:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
years I still have little faith that
 
05:45:49.310 --> 05:45:49.320 align:start position:0%
I've been given everything in the truth
 
05:45:51.110 --> 05:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I have or I haven't but
 
05:45:53.150 --> 05:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
if you look at the 10 who were who are
 
05:45:55.230 --> 05:45:55.240 align:start position:0%
the ones who are
 
05:45:57.468 --> 05:45:57.478 align:start position:0%
dismissed had there been body warn
 
05:45:59.590 --> 05:45:59.600 align:start position:0%
cameras in my case it would have been
 
05:46:02.190 --> 05:46:02.200 align:start position:0%
really solved very simple we would have
 
05:46:04.670 --> 05:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
known who said what when but if you look
 
05:46:06.430 --> 05:46:06.440 align:start position:0%
at the 10 that were dismissed nine of
 
05:46:09.590 --> 05:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
them were convicted of crimes or hunting
 
05:46:11.868 --> 05:46:11.878 align:start position:0%
violations some of which prohibited them
 
05:46:13.670 --> 05:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
from having guns and they still let them
 
05:46:15.350 --> 05:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
teach for a couple
 
05:46:17.708 --> 05:46:17.718 align:start position:0%
years I was pulled immediately my
 
05:46:20.150 --> 05:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
certification was pulled upon
 
05:46:23.390 --> 05:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
notice and I believe and still believe
 
05:46:24.830 --> 05:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
that it's because of my political
 
05:46:26.430 --> 05:46:26.440 align:start position:0%
activities in the state house and the
 
05:46:29.390 --> 05:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
fact that I stand up for hunters and and
 
05:46:31.990 --> 05:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
quite frankly I've won a lot of the
 
05:46:34.628 --> 05:46:34.638 align:start position:0%
cases but you have to look at this when
 
05:46:36.830 --> 05:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
conservation officers are interacting
 
05:46:39.230 --> 05:46:39.240 align:start position:0%
with the public it's no different than
 
05:46:40.788 --> 05:46:40.798 align:start position:0%
when police officers are interacting
 
05:46:43.070 --> 05:46:43.080 align:start position:0%
with the public and when they talk about
 
05:46:44.990 --> 05:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
domestic violence victims those are red
 
05:46:48.230 --> 05:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
herand those are complaining Witnesses
 
05:46:49.990 --> 05:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
we don't determine that someone's a
 
05:46:52.750 --> 05:46:52.760 align:start position:0%
victim until we have a trial till a jury
 
05:46:54.670 --> 05:46:54.680 align:start position:0%
says they're a victim or a judge says
 
05:46:56.868 --> 05:46:56.878 align:start position:0%
they're a victim until that they're
 
05:46:59.910 --> 05:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
complaining witness and he said he said
 
05:47:03.070 --> 05:47:03.080 align:start position:0%
thing there is not going to be any more
 
05:47:06.070 --> 05:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
problems with this video than anybody
 
05:47:09.030 --> 05:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
else's video if you look at the law
 
05:47:10.948 --> 05:47:10.958 align:start position:0%
enforcement throughout the country
 
05:47:12.628 --> 05:47:12.638 align:start position:0%
depending on Whose statistics you look
 
05:47:15.310 --> 05:47:15.320 align:start position:0%
at about 50% of law enforc in this
 
05:47:17.750 --> 05:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
country now has body warn cameras but
 
05:47:19.788 --> 05:47:19.798 align:start position:0%
here's what's more important they're
 
05:47:22.590 --> 05:47:22.600 align:start position:0%
cost effective the University of Chicago
 
05:47:24.548 --> 05:47:24.558 align:start position:0%
did a wonderful study a couple years ago
 
05:47:27.190 --> 05:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
and it's in the materials there and
 
05:47:29.468 --> 05:47:29.478 align:start position:0%
depending on which Economist you you ask
 
05:47:33.030 --> 05:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
it pays back 5 to one because what you
 
05:47:35.310 --> 05:47:35.320 align:start position:0%
have when you have body warn cameras is
 
05:47:37.350 --> 05:47:37.360 align:start position:0%
when you have complaints you don't have
 
05:47:39.830 --> 05:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
to do giant investigations you download
 
05:47:41.948 --> 05:47:41.958 align:start position:0%
the body camera and you look at who said
 
05:47:46.190 --> 05:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
what it saves a lot of complaints it's
 
05:47:49.628 --> 05:47:49.638 align:start position:0%
transparent and the bottom line is how
 
05:47:51.430 --> 05:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
many more people have to go through what
 
05:47:54.390 --> 05:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
I have been through thank you I I get
 
05:47:55.948 --> 05:47:55.958 align:start position:0%
that point and I I don't think any of
 
05:47:59.350 --> 05:47:59.360 align:start position:0%
the objection uh that I heard was about
 
05:48:01.670 --> 05:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
um the value of the
 
05:48:04.788 --> 05:48:04.798 align:start position:0%
cameras um most of the concern is just
 
05:48:06.830 --> 05:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
which section of law is this being put
 
05:48:09.510 --> 05:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
into and uh so if you've got any any
 
05:48:11.670 --> 05:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
further testimony that's specific to the
 
05:48:14.708 --> 05:48:14.718 align:start position:0%
body warn cameras as it is in this bill
 
05:48:16.230 --> 05:48:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh please let us know but we are running
 
05:48:19.230 --> 05:48:19.240 align:start position:0%
low on time yes sir um I specifically
 
05:48:24.190 --> 05:48:24.200 align:start position:0%
think that if you look at um lines 14-
 
05:48:26.750 --> 05:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
16 that says a duplicate copy of the
 
05:48:28.628 --> 05:48:28.638 align:start position:0%
recording shall be provided in its
 
05:48:30.948 --> 05:48:30.958 align:start position:0%
entirety to counsel for the defendant or
 
05:48:33.150 --> 05:48:33.160 align:start position:0%
a proed defendant pursuant to Discovery
 
05:48:35.350 --> 05:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
request there have been quite a lot of
 
05:48:38.150 --> 05:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
litigation in this state regarding that
 
05:48:40.190 --> 05:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
and we have judges thank goodness at
 
05:48:43.190 --> 05:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
least in the conqur area who say that
 
05:48:45.670 --> 05:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
law can't Trump the Constitution and
 
05:48:47.070 --> 05:48:47.080 align:start position:0%
they tell the prosecutors you're either
 
05:48:48.628 --> 05:48:48.638 align:start position:0%
going to give them the video or you're
 
05:48:50.190 --> 05:48:50.200 align:start position:0%
going to I'm going to dismiss a case for
 
05:48:52.590 --> 05:48:52.600 align:start position:0%
failure to give exculpatory evidence
 
05:48:55.030 --> 05:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
there's no reason that if you're the one
 
05:48:56.628 --> 05:48:56.638 align:start position:0%
that's on that video that you shouldn't
 
05:48:59.990 --> 05:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
be able to get a copy of it um and I can
 
05:49:02.468 --> 05:49:02.478 align:start position:0%
tell you that when law enforcement say
 
05:49:04.830 --> 05:49:04.840 align:start position:0%
that I have I'm body recording anymore
 
05:49:06.390 --> 05:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
citizens let them in their house all the
 
05:49:07.948 --> 05:49:07.958 align:start position:0%
time it's not this big thing like
 
05:49:10.390 --> 05:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
everybody talks about and they block out
 
05:49:12.350 --> 05:49:12.360 align:start position:0%
they um do that little blurring like if
 
05:49:13.868 --> 05:49:13.878 align:start position:0%
a woman didn't wear a blouse or
 
05:49:17.390 --> 05:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
something they blur that this bill is
 
05:49:19.990 --> 05:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
needed and it is very carefully crafted
 
05:49:23.830 --> 05:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
to solve the problem and just like many
 
05:49:26.270 --> 05:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
police officers wear their body cameras
 
05:49:28.030 --> 05:49:28.040 align:start position:0%
from start to finish the only time they
 
05:49:30.030 --> 05:49:30.040 align:start position:0%
don't wear them is in the bathroom in
 
05:49:32.110 --> 05:49:32.120 align:start position:0%
certain areas like that having
 
05:49:34.030 --> 05:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
conservation officers wear them to start
 
05:49:37.510 --> 05:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
to finish is good we need cases where
 
05:49:39.270 --> 05:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
you have he said he said where the
 
05:49:42.030 --> 05:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
conservation officers said this man said
 
05:49:43.548 --> 05:49:43.558 align:start position:0%
this or this man said that they're
 
05:49:45.708 --> 05:49:45.718 align:start position:0%
confiscating cell phones they're
 
05:49:48.430 --> 05:49:48.440 align:start position:0%
bullying people they're telling people
 
05:49:50.150 --> 05:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
if you give us a camera if you give us
 
05:49:52.310 --> 05:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
your cell phone you get it back tomorrow
 
05:49:54.070 --> 05:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
or the next day and if you use your
 
05:49:56.830 --> 05:49:56.840 align:start position:0%
password then you get it back quicker
 
05:49:58.750 --> 05:49:58.760 align:start position:0%
well I got clients with months and
 
05:49:59.948 --> 05:49:59.958 align:start position:0%
months and months and they're not giving
 
05:49:59.958 --> 05:50:00.788 align:start position:0%
months and months and they're not giving
them

05:50:00.788 --> 05:50:00.798 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:50:05.230 --> 05:50:05.240 align:start position:0%
back and so I think we want honesty and
 
05:50:07.628 --> 05:50:07.638 align:start position:0%
forthrightness and the bottom line is if
 
05:50:09.510 --> 05:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
they wear these cameras from start to
 
05:50:12.150 --> 05:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
finish and their shift like they should
 
05:50:14.150 --> 05:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
and particularly among our students
 
05:50:15.468 --> 05:50:15.478 align:start position:0%
we've got to say why are we getting
 
05:50:18.310 --> 05:50:18.320 align:start position:0%
diminishing numbers in Hunters what's
 
05:50:20.910 --> 05:50:20.920 align:start position:0%
causing that the next thing we talk
 
05:50:22.750 --> 05:50:22.760 align:start position:0%
about is the three years I've address
 
05:50:24.390 --> 05:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
that because the statute of limitations
 
05:50:28.788 --> 05:50:28.798 align:start position:0%
is different and the other the last last
 
05:50:32.708 --> 05:50:32.718 align:start position:0%
thing here is that these generally don't
 
05:50:35.708 --> 05:50:35.718 align:start position:0%
cost as much as you think and so when
 
05:50:37.190 --> 05:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
they talk about interaction with
 
05:50:39.230 --> 05:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
Sportsmen that should be on all the time
 
05:50:40.868 --> 05:50:40.878 align:start position:0%
because that way we'll see in the field
 
05:50:43.230 --> 05:50:43.240 align:start position:0%
what they're seeing rather than having
 
05:50:45.430 --> 05:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
them describe it after the fact so I'm
 
05:50:48.150 --> 05:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
happy to answer practical mechanical
 
05:50:49.990 --> 05:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
questions but I think that they
 
05:50:51.468 --> 05:50:51.478 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be exempt they have more
 
05:50:53.670 --> 05:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
Powers than the state troopers do thank
 
05:50:57.350 --> 05:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
you yeah does anybody have any
 
05:50:57.360 --> 05:50:59.270 align:start position:0%
you yeah does anybody have any
questions

05:50:59.270 --> 05:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:51:01.708 --> 05:51:01.718 align:start position:0%
representative Brown uh thank you Mr
 
05:51:04.150 --> 05:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
chair uh thanks for taking my question
 
05:51:07.430 --> 05:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
so if I understood what was previously
 
05:51:11.030 --> 05:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
said uh the law does not require law
 
05:51:12.708 --> 05:51:12.718 align:start position:0%
enforcement officials to wear a body
 
05:51:15.270 --> 05:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
warn camera it does not correct and you
 
05:51:17.270 --> 05:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
are saying
 
05:51:20.350 --> 05:51:20.360 align:start position:0%
that fishing under this law fish and gab
 
05:51:22.030 --> 05:51:22.040 align:start position:0%
would still have that option and you're
 
05:51:24.510 --> 05:51:24.520 align:start position:0%
saying they should choose to do so
 
05:51:27.070 --> 05:51:27.080 align:start position:0%
24/7 they should choose to do so when
 
05:51:28.910 --> 05:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
they are on the clock other words from
 
05:51:31.430 --> 05:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
the minute they start when they're being
 
05:51:33.190 --> 05:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
paid when they've got their uniform on
 
05:51:34.670 --> 05:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
when they're doing what I call the
 
05:51:36.708 --> 05:51:36.718 align:start position:0%
people's work yes they should because
 
05:51:38.750 --> 05:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
they take it people lose their hunting
 
05:51:40.190 --> 05:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
rights they lose their second amendment
 
05:51:42.788 --> 05:51:42.798 align:start position:0%
rights it's huge um for people that care
 
05:51:44.590 --> 05:51:44.600 align:start position:0%
about that type of thing and they
 
05:51:46.350 --> 05:51:46.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes have they forfeit their guns
 
05:51:48.468 --> 05:51:48.478 align:start position:0%
and ammo and so yes if they're
 
05:51:49.910 --> 05:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
interacting with the public I think they
 
05:51:52.310 --> 05:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
should be mandated to do so okay and
 
05:51:54.548 --> 05:51:54.558 align:start position:0%
followup please follow up so and that
 
05:51:56.150 --> 05:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
under under d as we've had this
 
05:51:58.350 --> 05:51:58.360 align:start position:0%
conversation about interactions that
 
05:52:01.350 --> 05:52:01.360 align:start position:0%
would basically be any any effort that a
 
05:52:04.510 --> 05:52:04.520 align:start position:0%
COO officer was involved in at all right
 
05:52:06.868 --> 05:52:06.878 align:start position:0%
which is how a lot of officers do wear
 
05:52:10.070 --> 05:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
their body cameras but again um they
 
05:52:13.190 --> 05:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
still assert privacy notices as
 
05:52:15.190 --> 05:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
necessary so for example if they put in
 
05:52:17.350 --> 05:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
someone with an iea there's still
 
05:52:19.830 --> 05:52:19.840 align:start position:0%
competing statutory Authority that says
 
05:52:22.110 --> 05:52:22.120 align:start position:0%
that would be essentially disclosing
 
05:52:23.430 --> 05:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
like I said if they come to assist with
 
05:52:26.788 --> 05:52:26.798 align:start position:0%
an involuntary emergency admission IA
 
05:52:28.868 --> 05:52:28.878 align:start position:0%
those things are still going to be
 
05:52:31.670 --> 05:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
um subject to being
 
05:52:35.750 --> 05:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
withheld thank you thank you any further
 
05:52:37.990 --> 05:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
questions not seeing any thank you so
 
05:52:41.030 --> 05:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
much Miss Dean for your testimony today
 
05:52:44.990 --> 05:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
that was our last uh person is there
 
05:52:46.750 --> 05:52:46.760 align:start position:0%
somebody else with a card I don't have a
 
05:52:50.750 --> 05:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:53.230 --> 05:52:53.240 align:start position:0%
sir might be in the wrong
 
05:52:55.590 --> 05:52:55.600 align:start position:0%
pile Colonel Jordan come on up if you
 
05:52:56.990 --> 05:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
don't have a card we'll give you a card
 
05:53:01.788 --> 05:53:01.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:04.788 --> 05:53:04.798 align:start position:0%
me so Mr chairman thank you for allowing
 
05:53:06.270 --> 05:53:06.280 align:start position:0%
me to testify again I'm here to
 
05:53:07.628 --> 05:53:07.638 align:start position:0%
represent the commission the commission
 
05:53:10.868 --> 05:53:10.878 align:start position:0%
reviewed this and is opposed to it for a
 
05:53:13.868 --> 05:53:13.878 align:start position:0%
number of reasons um found it okay thank
 
05:53:16.948 --> 05:53:16.958 align:start position:0%
you um as far as and I and it's
 
05:53:18.590 --> 05:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
unfortunate that Penny Dean had this
 
05:53:20.110 --> 05:53:20.120 align:start position:0%
issue I will tell you that she had an
 
05:53:23.310 --> 05:53:23.320 align:start position:0%
all day hearing uh it's been adjudicated
 
05:53:25.990 --> 05:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
and the state prevailed and she did not
 
05:53:27.830 --> 05:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry for that but that's was
 
05:53:29.708 --> 05:53:29.718 align:start position:0%
the fact facts and I'd be happy to
 
05:53:31.230 --> 05:53:31.240 align:start position:0%
provide you with three ring binders to
 
05:53:32.628 --> 05:53:32.638 align:start position:0%
show you the evidence in that case it
 
05:53:33.948 --> 05:53:33.958 align:start position:0%
was quite different from what you were
 
05:53:37.350 --> 05:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
just told I can assure you um so the
 
05:53:38.708 --> 05:53:38.718 align:start position:0%
first thing I want to say to you is
 
05:53:41.110 --> 05:53:41.120 align:start position:0%
that's the wrong reason first of all the
 
05:53:42.868 --> 05:53:42.878 align:start position:0%
Mandate the conservation officers wear
 
05:53:44.590 --> 05:53:44.600 align:start position:0%
cameras we'd be the only agency in the
 
05:53:46.390 --> 05:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire mandated to do
 
05:53:48.270 --> 05:53:48.280 align:start position:0%
that I don't have a problem with cameras
 
05:53:50.670 --> 05:53:50.680 align:start position:0%
quite frankly if you all remember for 12
 
05:53:53.190 --> 05:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
Seasons we we took cameras with us on a
 
05:53:55.750 --> 05:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
daily basis it was called Northwoods law
 
05:53:57.190 --> 05:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
if and I would encourage anyone if
 
05:53:58.510 --> 05:53:58.520 align:start position:0%
they're worried about what obervation
 
05:54:01.030 --> 05:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
officers are doing go watch the show cuz
 
05:54:03.190 --> 05:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
it shows from Day from the time they get
 
05:54:05.110 --> 05:54:05.120 align:start position:0%
out of bed in the morning practically
 
05:54:07.270 --> 05:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
until they go to bed at night and and it
 
05:54:09.548 --> 05:54:09.558 align:start position:0%
was aired we are only the only law
 
05:54:10.910 --> 05:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency in the state of New
 
05:54:12.548 --> 05:54:12.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that took that risk I might
 
05:54:14.948 --> 05:54:14.958 align:start position:0%
add and it was aired across the world
 
05:54:18.110 --> 05:54:18.120 align:start position:0%
for the world to review and and render
 
05:54:21.430 --> 05:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
opinions on and it was highly successful
 
05:54:23.030 --> 05:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
it was highly successful is because
 
05:54:24.830 --> 05:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
these officers have integrity Beyond
 
05:54:27.350 --> 05:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
reproach I'd put them up against anyone
 
05:54:28.830 --> 05:54:28.840 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
05:54:30.708 --> 05:54:30.718 align:start position:0%
uh they do not do things wrong they do
 
05:54:32.350 --> 05:54:32.360 align:start position:0%
not do things that are in violations
 
05:54:34.310 --> 05:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
that's what we have Courts for courts
 
05:54:36.548 --> 05:54:36.558 align:start position:0%
make those decisions on these cases
 
05:54:38.350 --> 05:54:38.360 align:start position:0%
there's no unfortunate poor people being
 
05:54:40.390 --> 05:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
whipped at the post that's just an old
 
05:54:42.230 --> 05:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
wies tale they get their day in court
 
05:54:44.910 --> 05:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
just like everybody else does I will say
 
05:54:47.430 --> 05:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
this one thing the leg with all due
 
05:54:49.350 --> 05:54:49.360 align:start position:0%
respect one thing the legislature does
 
05:54:51.670 --> 05:54:51.680 align:start position:0%
to us on a regular basis is they mandate
 
05:54:53.628 --> 05:54:53.638 align:start position:0%
certain functions you do it with All
 
05:54:55.110 --> 05:54:55.120 align:start position:0%
State agencies the problem with New
 
05:54:56.750 --> 05:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fishing game is we are a
 
05:55:00.548 --> 05:55:00.558 align:start position:0%
self-funded a agency self-funded there
 
05:55:02.390 --> 05:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
is no other law enforcement agency in
 
05:55:04.830 --> 05:55:04.840 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire funded by
 
05:55:08.110 --> 05:55:08.120 align:start position:0%
user fees none they all receive taxpayer
 
05:55:11.150 --> 05:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
dollars either in general funds or or uh
 
05:55:13.350 --> 05:55:13.360 align:start position:0%
other and a lot of other states Wildlife
 
05:55:15.510 --> 05:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
agencies in fact where we got the fiscal
 
05:55:17.590 --> 05:55:17.600 align:start position:0%
node information from other agencies
 
05:55:18.948 --> 05:55:18.958 align:start position:0%
that are wearing these cameras are all
 
05:55:21.468 --> 05:55:21.478 align:start position:0%
funded by taxpayer money I don't have a
 
05:55:23.030 --> 05:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
problem wearing a camera I'll strap a
 
05:55:25.190 --> 05:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
camera on All 48 of these people what I
 
05:55:26.628 --> 05:55:26.638 align:start position:0%
do have a problem with is I don't have
 
05:55:28.590 --> 05:55:28.600 align:start position:0%
the money to pay for it Colonel Jordan
 
05:55:29.868 --> 05:55:29.878 align:start position:0%
that was part of the fiscal note it was
 
05:55:30.990 --> 05:55:31.000 align:start position:0%
going to go and give you funds we
 
05:55:32.030 --> 05:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
weren't going to ask you to do it
 
05:55:33.708 --> 05:55:33.718 align:start position:0%
without paying for those cameras so but
 
05:55:35.670 --> 05:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
it the funding has to be a constant
 
05:55:37.750 --> 05:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
funding okay it has to be something that
 
05:55:39.990 --> 05:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
isn't a matching Grant a matching Grant
 
05:55:41.390 --> 05:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
is going to require us to come up with
 
05:55:43.948 --> 05:55:43.958 align:start position:0%
the money we can't do that now and and
 
05:55:46.390 --> 05:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
frankly if there's a taste in the state
 
05:55:48.150 --> 05:55:48.160 align:start position:0%
to produce
 
05:55:50.270 --> 05:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
$200,000 let me make a couple of
 
05:55:52.670 --> 05:55:52.680 align:start position:0%
suggestions to you one is fund search
 
05:55:54.830 --> 05:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
and rescue that hasn't been done in over
 
05:55:57.230 --> 05:55:57.240 align:start position:0%
20 years I've been coming to this body
 
05:55:59.708 --> 05:55:59.718 align:start position:0%
for 20 years asking for search and
 
05:56:02.788 --> 05:56:02.798 align:start position:0%
rescue to be funded that saves lives it
 
05:56:04.270 --> 05:56:04.280 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with a courtroom
 
05:56:05.788 --> 05:56:05.798 align:start position:0%
prosecution it's got nothing to do with
 
05:56:09.948 --> 05:56:09.958 align:start position:0%
Miss Dean it saves lives let's fund that
 
05:56:11.670 --> 05:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
let's spend the money so that I can get
 
05:56:13.590 --> 05:56:13.600 align:start position:0%
them better equipped to go above Tree
 
05:56:15.948 --> 05:56:15.958 align:start position:0%
Line like they did last week in 80 mph
 
05:56:18.430 --> 05:56:18.440 align:start position:0%
winds to bring that poor soul down we've
 
05:56:20.830 --> 05:56:20.840 align:start position:0%
never done that let's attach that to
 
05:56:22.948 --> 05:56:22.958 align:start position:0%
this bill and go to Fisco with it I I'm
 
05:56:24.548 --> 05:56:24.558 align:start position:0%
all about that I've been trying to do it
 
05:56:27.150 --> 05:56:27.160 align:start position:0%
for 15 years we could put on more
 
05:56:28.708 --> 05:56:28.718 align:start position:0%
conservations officer two other
 
05:56:30.190 --> 05:56:30.200 align:start position:0%
conservation officer could be hired and
 
05:56:31.670 --> 05:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
equipped for this kind of
 
05:56:35.150 --> 05:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
money that this is a waste of money a
 
05:56:37.390 --> 05:56:37.400 align:start position:0%
complete waste of money and it
 
05:56:39.948 --> 05:56:39.958 align:start position:0%
frustrates me because there are so many
 
05:56:41.310 --> 05:56:41.320 align:start position:0%
other things that we could do for the
 
05:56:43.070 --> 05:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
citizens of our state if you if you're
 
05:56:45.430 --> 05:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
willing to spend that money let's do it
 
05:56:46.708 --> 05:56:46.718 align:start position:0%
but let's do it on something that's
 
05:56:48.070 --> 05:56:48.080 align:start position:0%
going to make a difference for everybody
 
05:56:49.628 --> 05:56:49.638 align:start position:0%
in the state all the citizens of the
 
05:56:53.070 --> 05:56:53.080 align:start position:0%
state not the cam not the cameras go to
 
05:56:54.390 --> 05:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
Northwoods law if you want to see what
 
05:56:56.390 --> 05:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
we did we did it every day for years and
 
05:56:57.590 --> 05:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
I don't have a problem with it we put it
 
05:56:59.788 --> 05:56:59.798 align:start position:0%
on prime time as I as I said we're the
 
05:57:01.390 --> 05:57:01.400 align:start position:0%
only ones that ever did that but let's
 
05:57:04.990 --> 05:57:05.000 align:start position:0%
not waste this money on on cameras
 
05:57:06.628 --> 05:57:06.638 align:start position:0%
because one person in the state feels
 
05:57:08.390 --> 05:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
that she was wronged and it's necessary
 
05:57:10.310 --> 05:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
that's nonsense spend it on something
 
05:57:12.030 --> 05:57:12.040 align:start position:0%
that's going to help our citizens help
 
05:57:14.190 --> 05:57:14.200 align:start position:0%
our Sportsman I've never we just
 
05:57:16.670 --> 05:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
finished two rounds of banial hearings
 
05:57:19.390 --> 05:57:19.400 align:start position:0%
where people put up uh suggestions and
 
05:57:20.910 --> 05:57:20.920 align:start position:0%
ideas to no Hampshire fishing game on
 
05:57:23.150 --> 05:57:23.160 align:start position:0%
things to change I have never once never
 
05:57:25.430 --> 05:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
once heard from a sportsman or woman
 
05:57:27.270 --> 05:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
that has asked for a body War camera
 
05:57:29.150 --> 05:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
I've heard him ask for better management
 
05:57:31.510 --> 05:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
of our Wildlife Resources more purchase
 
05:57:33.708 --> 05:57:33.718 align:start position:0%
of habitats and lands more officers out
 
05:57:35.750 --> 05:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
in the field to do their job let's fund
 
05:57:37.230 --> 05:57:37.240 align:start position:0%
search and rescue so I don't have to pay
 
05:57:39.070 --> 05:57:39.080 align:start position:0%
for it with my hunting dollars anymore I
 
05:57:41.110 --> 05:57:41.120 align:start position:0%
get asked that daily I've never been
 
05:57:42.788 --> 05:57:42.798 align:start position:0%
asked for a body camera I don't think
 
05:57:44.628 --> 05:57:44.638 align:start position:0%
there's a desire for that from our users
 
05:57:46.628 --> 05:57:46.638 align:start position:0%
who are paying the bills I think we
 
05:57:48.788 --> 05:57:48.798 align:start position:0%
ought to listen to that I'd ask you to
 
05:57:51.510 --> 05:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
to join me in saying no to this it's
 
05:57:53.510 --> 05:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
ridiculous it's unnecessary and it's a
 
05:57:55.628 --> 05:57:55.638 align:start position:0%
waste of a lot of money thank you very
 
05:57:59.510 --> 05:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
much thank you Colonel any questions
 
05:58:02.390 --> 05:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
one question uh representative
 
05:58:04.750 --> 05:58:04.760 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you Colonel for taking my
 
05:58:08.110 --> 05:58:08.120 align:start position:0%
question and I for one have
 
05:58:10.990 --> 05:58:11.000 align:start position:0%
always reached out for more funding for
 
05:58:13.150 --> 05:58:13.160 align:start position:0%
yes you have search and rescue but I'm
 
05:58:15.750 --> 05:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
looking at the fiscal note and I I just
 
05:58:18.750 --> 05:58:18.760 align:start position:0%
look at on the backs of sports men and
 
05:58:19.948 --> 05:58:19.958 align:start position:0%
women in this
 
05:58:22.948 --> 05:58:22.958 align:start position:0%
state to have to take out of the
 
05:58:24.830 --> 05:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
department another looking at the fiscal
 
05:58:28.830 --> 05:58:28.840 align:start position:0%
note between 102 and 117,000
 
05:58:31.628 --> 05:58:31.638 align:start position:0%
out of the funds that are already thin I
 
05:58:35.190 --> 05:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
mean would this mean cutting somewhere
 
05:58:37.430 --> 05:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
else oh it's absolutely going to mean
 
05:58:39.670 --> 05:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
cutting it it attorney helison from
 
05:58:41.310 --> 05:58:41.320 align:start position:0%
Marat County by the way I didn't call
 
05:58:43.150 --> 05:58:43.160 align:start position:0%
him he reached out to me because he was
 
05:58:45.670 --> 05:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
concerned about the cost of this he
 
05:58:47.310 --> 05:58:47.320 align:start position:0%
indicated to me that those figures are
 
05:58:50.548 --> 05:58:50.558 align:start position:0%
probably low based on his experiences
 
05:58:52.990 --> 05:58:53.000 align:start position:0%
and so uh all the agencies that are
 
05:58:54.110 --> 05:58:54.120 align:start position:0%
doing this are telling me that they're
 
05:58:56.708 --> 05:58:56.718 align:start position:0%
hiring Personnel to manage these things
 
05:58:58.190 --> 05:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
I don't have a problem again again I
 
05:59:00.350 --> 05:59:00.360 align:start position:0%
have no problem with doing any of this
 
05:59:03.628 --> 05:59:03.638 align:start position:0%
if I have all of my very long needs
 
05:59:05.468 --> 05:59:05.478 align:start position:0%
fulfilled that we've been asking for for
 
05:59:06.990 --> 05:59:07.000 align:start position:0%
years if I'm going to hire another
 
05:59:08.468 --> 05:59:08.478 align:start position:0%
person I'd rather put him in a costume
 
05:59:10.070 --> 05:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
like this and put him out in the field
 
05:59:11.708 --> 05:59:11.718 align:start position:0%
that's where I need him I don't need him
 
05:59:13.390 --> 05:59:13.400 align:start position:0%
managing a camera business I need him
 
05:59:16.070 --> 05:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
out in the field um so yes you would
 
05:59:17.190 --> 05:59:17.200 align:start position:0%
have you're going to we're going to end
 
05:59:19.830 --> 05:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
up losing or cutting uh probably
 
05:59:21.990 --> 05:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
Personnel if I got to pay that so I'm
 
05:59:23.910 --> 05:59:23.920 align:start position:0%

in this building before uh I'm just here
 
05:59:58.310 --> 05:59:58.320 align:start position:0%

do what you do so thank you for doing
 
06:00:11.468 --> 06:00:11.478 align:start position:0%
that um I I am a resident of Bedford
 
06:00:14.390 --> 06:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
going on eight years um my family and I
 
06:00:17.390 --> 06:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
live there 12-year-old daughter and I'm
 
06:00:21.110 --> 06:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
a big supporter of um the police I'm a
 
06:00:24.150 --> 06:00:24.160 align:start position:0%
committee down there to uh create a new
 
06:00:25.628 --> 06:00:25.638 align:start position:0%
uh police
 
06:00:28.590 --> 06:00:28.600 align:start position:0%
department what concerns me what I hear
 
06:00:31.190 --> 06:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
today and I wasn't planning on speaking
 
06:00:33.230 --> 06:00:33.240 align:start position:0%
is that I feel like there's a lot of
 
06:00:35.468 --> 06:00:35.478 align:start position:0%
things being said almost fear being
 
06:00:37.910 --> 06:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
whipped up in this room about something
 
06:00:39.670 --> 06:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
that's been around body warn cameras
 
06:00:41.670 --> 06:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
have been around for a long time it's
 
06:00:44.390 --> 06:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
nothing new and I know that there's
 
06:00:46.868 --> 06:00:46.878 align:start position:0%
probably people on both sides of this
 
06:00:48.628 --> 06:00:48.638 align:start position:0%
table that have their feelings one way
 
06:00:50.468 --> 06:00:50.478 align:start position:0%
or the other but I guess my question
 
06:00:51.990 --> 06:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
comes down
 
06:00:55.150 --> 06:00:55.160 align:start position:0%
to what are we
 
06:00:57.868 --> 06:00:57.878 align:start position:0%
hiding the the funding of it is going to
 
06:01:00.030 --> 06:01:00.040 align:start position:0%
be a separate discussion if I understand
 
06:01:01.468 --> 06:01:01.478 align:start position:0%
that correctly right that's not being
 
06:01:04.270 --> 06:01:04.280 align:start position:0%
decided today so why don't we give that
 
06:01:04.280 --> 06:01:05.190 align:start position:0%
decided today so why don't we give that
a

06:01:05.190 --> 06:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:01:08.910 --> 06:01:08.920 align:start position:0%
chance to be funded let's decide on
 
06:01:11.230 --> 06:01:11.240 align:start position:0%
whether or not we actually need it and
 
06:01:13.350 --> 06:01:13.360 align:start position:0%
and I believe greater accountability we
 
06:01:15.788 --> 06:01:15.798 align:start position:0%
live in a very litigious world and
 
06:01:17.030 --> 06:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
things are happening all the time you
 
06:01:18.150 --> 06:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
see it on the
 
06:01:20.750 --> 06:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
news and this is a chance to go okay
 
06:01:22.590 --> 06:01:22.600 align:start position:0%
we're being transparent with what we're
 
06:01:24.190 --> 06:01:24.200 align:start position:0%
doing and I don't think there's anything
 
06:01:25.750 --> 06:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
wrong with that and I think a lot of
 
06:01:27.190 --> 06:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
American people support it thank you
 
06:01:30.070 --> 06:01:30.080 align:start position:0%
very much and thank you for what you do
 
06:01:34.628 --> 06:01:34.638 align:start position:0%

discussions short though because we know
 
06:15:26.910 --> 06:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
that we are running running low low on

time and I know people wanted to get out
 
06:15:30.548 --> 06:15:30.558 align:start position:0%
this will be one sentence I will be
 
06:15:32.350 --> 06:15:32.360 align:start position:0%

concerned about the any any uh action or
 
06:15:57.390 --> 06:15:57.400 align:start position:0%
the remove removal of the lever action
 
06:15:59.628 --> 06:15:59.638 align:start position:0%

06:16:03.548 --> 06:16:03.558 align:start position:0%
the uh doors to um to people walking
 
06:16:06.510 --> 06:16:06.520 align:start position:0%

06:16:45.788 --> 06:16:45.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:48.708 --> 06:16:48.718 align:start position:0%
H and would somebody second my offering
 
06:16:51.310 --> 06:16:51.320 align:start position:0%
of that Amendment I'll second that Mr
 
06:16:53.628 --> 06:16:53.638 align:start position:0%
chair okay uh I'm going to discuss my
 
06:16:56.070 --> 06:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh as representative Darby
 
06:16:57.390 --> 06:16:57.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned this amendment just simply
 
06:17:00.548 --> 06:17:00.558 align:start position:0%
strikes the 38 from in front of the 357
 
06:17:03.230 --> 06:17:03.240 align:start position:0%
which uh clarifies everything to make it
 
06:17:06.030 --> 06:17:06.040 align:start position:0%
much nicer and uh there's no ambiguity
 
06:17:08.468 --> 06:17:08.478 align:start position:0%
on the 38 uh originally it was put in
 
06:17:11.350 --> 06:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
simply because I told OS that the gun is
 
06:17:11.360 --> 06:17:12.590 align:start position:0%
simply because I told OS that the gun is
a

06:17:12.590 --> 06:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:17:14.708 --> 06:17:14.718 align:start position:0%
38357 CU I've grown up knowing you can
 
06:17:17.708 --> 06:17:17.718 align:start position:0%
shoot 38s or 357 through the same gun
 
06:17:20.070 --> 06:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
and they put the 38 in there so uh we
 
06:17:22.190 --> 06:17:22.200 align:start position:0%
took it back out and so I think it's a
 
06:17:23.830 --> 06:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
much better bill without uh with that
 
06:17:25.468 --> 06:17:25.478 align:start position:0%
Amendment without the 38 in front of it
 
06:17:26.990 --> 06:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
and I had asked for everyone to support
 
06:17:29.468 --> 06:17:29.478 align:start position:0%
that and uh that's the end of my
 
06:17:30.788 --> 06:17:30.798 align:start position:0%
discussion is there any other discussion
 
06:17:33.030 --> 06:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
