00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 align:start position:0%
recall for an article 5 convention it
 
00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 align:start position:0%
was just the policy of what limitations
 
00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 align:start position:0%
our delegates would have at an article 5
 
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
convention and that was the meat of the
 
00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 align:start position:0%
bill that was sent to us uh very minor
 
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact however part of The
 
00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 align:start position:0%
Proposal uh would include a stipend of a
 
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars a day for the members of
 
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 align:start position:0%
the article 5 convention and those
 
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 align:start position:0%
members would be New Hampshire
 
00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 align:start position:0%
legislators going to the convention we
 
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
didn't feel it was right to give those
 
00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 align:start position:0%
members a hundred dollar stipend a day
 
00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 align:start position:0%
in addition to their travel
 
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
reimbursements and and other
 
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 align:start position:0%
accommodations that were made for
 
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 align:start position:0%
essentially when we get paid 100 a year
 
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 align:start position:0%
giving certain members 100 a day in
 
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 align:start position:0%
service of their their work as
 
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 align:start position:0%
Representatives or state senators just
 
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 align:start position:0%
didn't sit right with the division so
 
00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 align:start position:0%
the amendment 0752h just removed the 100
 
00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 align:start position:0%
a day stipend everything else in the
 
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 align:start position:0%
bill is is the same essentially
 
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
for any future convention that may take
 
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.850 align:start position:0%
for any future convention that may take
place

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
the delegates from New Hampshire are
 
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
limited in scope to what they could
 
00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 align:start position:0%
based on the resolution that was adopted
 
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 align:start position:0%
for it so it's just a kind of broad
 
00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 align:start position:0%
policy for for that future occurrence
 
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 align:start position:0%
but we just wanted to make sure that we
 
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 align:start position:0%
weren't giving
 
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
future legislators an opportunity for a
 
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 align:start position:0%
hundred dollar a day stipend for extra
 
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 align:start position:0%
work but while keeping the other
 
00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
accommodations valuable
 
00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.730 align:start position:0%
accommodations valuable
so

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 align:start position:0%

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 align:start position:0%

um actually ought to pass
 
00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:36.540 align:start position:0%
um we did put this in the budget but in
 
00:11:38.509 --> 00:11:38.519 align:start position:0%
fact there's a technical correction in
 
00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
the bill itself so it does need to
 
00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:42.540 align:start position:0%
um pass
 
00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:46.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:51.300 align:start position:0%
before the house yes okay so your motion
 
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
is not to pass so it can be in the
 
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
calendar so the changes are approved yes
 
00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:56.700 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:00.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:03.290 align:start position:0%
 
chief

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:07.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
your second yes further discussion on
 
00:12:13.009 --> 00:12:13.019 align:start position:0%
House Bill 364.
 
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
this is representative Earth
 
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
this is the retain
 
00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
what do you think because they changed
 
00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:22.380 align:start position:0%
all right so you say you changed it
 
00:12:24.769 --> 00:12:24.779 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be an amendment no there's no
 
00:12:27.889 --> 00:12:27.899 align:start position:0%
there's no initially when I spoke with
 
00:12:30.829 --> 00:12:30.839 align:start position:0%
chair Emrick I had thought we should
 
00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:33.300 align:start position:0%
just retain that bill but then I went
 
00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
back and I checked the language in the
 
00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:39.060 align:start position:0%
in the bill itself and representative
 
00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:42.420 align:start position:0%
Ladd had made a correction in the the
 
00:12:45.889 --> 00:12:45.899 align:start position:0%
initial bill itself that we need we took
 
00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
the action of funding in the for the
 
00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:51.060 align:start position:0%
Career and Technical education students
 
00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:53.940 align:start position:0%
but he also had some language a
 
00:12:56.269 --> 00:12:56.279 align:start position:0%
correction to the statutes that needed
 
00:12:58.910 --> 00:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
to go along with the bill so um I moved
 
00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
to OTP at there's no Amendment this was
 
00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:04.980 align:start position:0%
an increase in the in the amounts right
 
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
yes we increased it and is in the budget
 
00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.449 align:start position:0%
yes we increased it and is in the budget
okay

00:13:08.449 --> 00:13:08.459 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
00:13:13.069 --> 00:13:13.079 align:start position:0%
so the reason it's ought to pass is
 
00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:15.180 align:start position:0%
because of the changes so they can be
 
00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
brought before the full session yes
 
00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:21.000 align:start position:0%

HP 430 relative to applications for the

education Freedom accounts program this
 
00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:01.500 align:start position:0%
bill was required one year of public
 
00:19:04.909 --> 00:19:04.919 align:start position:0%
school prior to attending or using the
 
00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:07.140 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account program the
 
00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:09.780 align:start position:0%
motion to is to itl made by
 
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler and I let
 
00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:14.940 align:start position:0%
represent anybody speak to his motion
 
00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:23.940 align:start position:0%
me okay that's good okay this bill would
 
00:19:26.289 --> 00:19:26.299 align:start position:0%
have changed the rules for
 
00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:28.740 align:start position:0%
Education Freedom accounts and made it
 
00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:30.780 align:start position:0%
more difficult especially in a case
 
00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:32.340 align:start position:0%
where a family had
 
00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:33.409 align:start position:0%
where a family had
uh

00:19:33.409 --> 00:19:33.419 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:35.820 align:start position:0%
decided on the first child that they
 
00:19:37.549 --> 00:19:37.559 align:start position:0%
were going to be going to using the
 
00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:39.660 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account and then it
 
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
might make difficult if a second child
 
00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
had already made their decision they'd
 
00:19:45.049 --> 00:19:45.059 align:start position:0%
already arranged transportation and now
 
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
they would have to had put a child in in
 
00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:50.340 align:start position:0%
school for a year also would be if if
 
00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:52.559 align:start position:0%
someone moved here and had already made
 
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
up their mind that they wanted to send
 
00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
their child to a private school or a
 
00:19:58.970 --> 00:19:58.980 align:start position:0%
charter school now they would have to
 
00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
have that child attend a year of school
 
00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:03.660 align:start position:0%
before they could
 
00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:06.780 align:start position:0%
go to the one the parents desired it
 
00:20:07.789 --> 00:20:07.799 align:start position:0%
seemed like
 
00:20:07.799 --> 00:20:08.810 align:start position:0%
seemed like
a

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:08.820 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:20:12.409 --> 00:20:12.419 align:start position:0%
a needless reason to uh
 
00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
to force the parents to make a decision
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
different than the one they had already
 
00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:19.919 align:start position:0%
made so
 
00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:23.340 align:start position:0%
I asked to itl this bill
 
00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:27.900 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Heath turn your
 
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
light on thank you um Mr chair
 
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
um this bill
 
00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:37.980 align:start position:0%
came about because the efas originally
 
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
were introduced to us as a choice for
 
00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:46.020 align:start position:0%
students in public schools wishing to
 
00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
take those funds to a private or
 
00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
sectarian or homeschooling
 
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.630 align:start position:0%
sectarian or homeschooling
venue

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
venue
 
00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:56.220 align:start position:0%
this bill just reinforces that purpose
 
00:20:59.870 --> 00:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
that was originally stated for this
 
00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
purpose I think it is only
 
00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:08.220 align:start position:0%
logical that we would include this we
 
00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:10.500 align:start position:0%
find that during the first year of the
 
00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:13.260 align:start position:0%
implementation of the efas
 
00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:16.260 align:start position:0%
almost 80 percent of those individuals
 
00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:19.500 align:start position:0%
securing efas never attended a public
 
00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:22.559 align:start position:0%
school therefore I really think the
 
00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
purpose that was stated originally was
 
00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:29.700 align:start position:0%
not clearly intended just to Simply
 
00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:32.220 align:start position:0%
arbitrarily be for
 
00:21:36.049 --> 00:21:36.059 align:start position:0%
those already seeking
 
00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
those already in private schools it
 
00:21:41.149 --> 00:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
would be intended for those in public
 
00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
schools meaning needing another choice
 
00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:49.380 align:start position:0%
so I would encourage you to vote no on
 
00:21:51.649 --> 00:21:51.659 align:start position:0%
the itl so another motion can be made
 
00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:59.810 --> 00:21:59.820 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards I'll be voting uh
 
00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:02.460 align:start position:0%
yes to the itl I think the most
 
00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
important thing we do in one of the
 
00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
scarcest resources we have is a child's
 
00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:10.380 align:start position:0%
time an educational window and the
 
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
parents understand their child's needs
 
00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:15.900 align:start position:0%
and will provide for it the best way
 
00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
possible I think as adults our role is
 
00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:22.140 align:start position:0%
to support the family and the child and
 
00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
uh and this bill does not do that so I I
 
00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:26.990 align:start position:0%
uh and this bill does not do that so I I
itl

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
itl
 
00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
representative hacken Phillips
 
00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:31.970 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:31.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
as a point of reference I'd just like to
 
00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:35.820 align:start position:0%
remind the committee that this bill did
 
00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:40.140 align:start position:0%
pass the floor with a vote of 176 to 169
 
00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
and it was referred to this committee to
 
00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:43.669 align:start position:0%
and it was referred to this committee to
consider

00:22:43.669 --> 00:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
consider
 
00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:45.900 align:start position:0%
not the policy implications but the
 
00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
financial impact of this bill
 
00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:51.900 align:start position:0%
I will point out that it will produce a
 
00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:54.780 align:start position:0%
considerable savings to our state to
 
00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:56.700 align:start position:0%
control the fact that folks would have
 
00:22:58.490 --> 00:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
to be in a public school for a year
 
00:23:00.049 --> 00:23:00.059 align:start position:0%
before they could take those money out
 
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
of the public schools and that we are
 
00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:05.340 align:start position:0%
not um
 
00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:08.580 align:start position:0%
supposed to be retaking up the policy of
 
00:23:10.909 --> 00:23:10.919 align:start position:0%
this bill but actually concentrating on
 
00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:13.620 align:start position:0%
that fiscal impact therefore I will be
 
00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:14.630 align:start position:0%
that fiscal impact therefore I will be
voting

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
voting
 
00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:15.289 align:start position:0%
voting
um

00:23:15.289 --> 00:23:15.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
for this against the emotion to it also
 
00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
that another motion can be made and I
 
00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:22.020 align:start position:0%
would encourage the rest of my
 
00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:23.460 align:start position:0%
colleagues to remember that we are not
 
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
the policy committee thank you
 
00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
representative Mueller
 
00:23:31.669 --> 00:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:33.900 align:start position:0%
I completely agree we are not a policy
 
00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
committee but the bill does have
 
00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:37.380 align:start position:0%
financial implications and there's a
 
00:23:39.409 --> 00:23:39.419 align:start position:0%
member of Finance it is my job to best
 
00:23:42.649 --> 00:23:42.659 align:start position:0%
allocate State funds ifas do save money
 
00:23:45.289 --> 00:23:45.299 align:start position:0%
and I think it is a place where it is
 
00:23:48.289 --> 00:23:48.299 align:start position:0%
not a good Financial
 
00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:50.820 align:start position:0%
you know approach to
 
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
have people spend more money so kids can

Education to administer the education
 
00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:29.940 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts uh vote was 5-4 Ito
 
00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:32.940 align:start position:0%
motion made by representative Weiler if
 
00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:35.660 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to your motion
 
00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
what we don't understand we had to um
 
00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:41.220 align:start position:0%
systems that's been working for a number
 
00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:44.460 align:start position:0%
of years on uh education Freedom
 
00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:45.650 align:start position:0%
of years on uh education Freedom
accounts

00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:45.660 align:start position:0%
accounts
 
00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:48.540 align:start position:0%
the group that is doing that is going
 
00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:51.900 align:start position:0%
out and visiting the businesses and
 
00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
soliciting them to make the
 
00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
contributions which are 85 percent tax
 
00:42:59.569 --> 00:42:59.579 align:start position:0%
deductible to the program I don't think
 
00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:02.460 align:start position:0%
uh a state employee would do the same
 
00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:03.349 align:start position:0%
uh a state employee would do the same
thing

00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
plus they are working there's a there's
 
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
a short turnaround when they get the
 
00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:10.079 align:start position:0%
applications and they'll work six seven
 
00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
days a week in ten hours a day so
 
00:43:17.329 --> 00:43:17.339 align:start position:0%
because of that um that short turnaround
 
00:43:20.809 --> 00:43:20.819 align:start position:0%
and that concentration I felt that this
 
00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:22.500 align:start position:0%
should not go to the Department of Ed
 
00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:24.660 align:start position:0%
until there was a little more study on
 
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
how those things would be done because
 
00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:28.140 align:start position:0%
they're kind of over and above what
 
00:43:31.849 --> 00:43:31.859 align:start position:0%
state employees do so I felt that this
 
00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:33.839 align:start position:0%
bill should not move forward without
 
00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:36.180 align:start position:0%
that further planning on how we would
 
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
replace this effort and these people are
 
00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:42.780 align:start position:0%
basically working for a percentage which
 
00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:44.940 align:start position:0%
is going out and they're also hiring
 
00:43:46.849 --> 00:43:46.859 align:start position:0%
people so that they get this work done
 
00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
on the short time span and it's just
 
00:43:51.109 --> 00:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
part-time people some of them volunteers
 
00:43:54.109 --> 00:43:54.119 align:start position:0%
so to think we should replace that
 
00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
overnight I don't think is going to be
 
00:43:58.569 --> 00:43:58.579 align:start position:0%
successful without having the
 
00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:01.140 align:start position:0%
committee on education do some further
 
00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:03.349 align:start position:0%
committee on education do some further
research

00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
research
 
00:44:12.349 --> 00:44:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:20.220 align:start position:0%
sorry representative Heath thank you Mr
 
00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
chair with all due respect um we're
 
00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:24.300 align:start position:0%
talking about the education Freedom
 
00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:25.740 align:start position:0%
accounts and we're talking about
 
00:44:29.089 --> 00:44:29.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
um as you probably all know I I used to
 
00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:34.140 align:start position:0%
work at the Department of Education and
 
00:44:36.109 --> 00:44:36.119 align:start position:0%
um the education Freedom accounts
 
00:44:40.069 --> 00:44:40.079 align:start position:0%
currently are administered by a private
 
00:44:40.079 --> 00:44:41.750 align:start position:0%
currently are administered by a private
agency

00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
agency
 
00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:42.530 align:start position:0%
agency
um

00:44:42.530 --> 00:44:42.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:44.630 align:start position:0%
um
no

00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:47.700 align:start position:0%
in most cases where we have millions of
 
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
dollars that come through the state of
 
00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:52.260 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it goes to a department
 
00:44:55.370 --> 00:44:55.380 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this bill is to assign
 
00:44:58.010 --> 00:44:58.020 align:start position:0%
the education Freedom accounts and their
 
00:44:59.750 --> 00:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
oversight to the New Hampshire
 
00:45:02.329 --> 00:45:02.339 align:start position:0%
Department of Ed now the New Hampshire
 
00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Ed may choose
 
00:45:08.690 --> 00:45:08.700 align:start position:0%
to do a contract an RFP that indeed they
 
00:45:12.650 --> 00:45:12.660 align:start position:0%
may choose the current vendor however
 
00:45:15.829 --> 00:45:15.839 align:start position:0%
there has been no process picking the
 
00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:17.220 align:start position:0%
current vendor
 
00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:21.180 align:start position:0%
you know just as as a former person who
 
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
had to do the books at the department of
 
00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
Ed and and look at the oversight I think
 
00:45:29.089 --> 00:45:29.099 align:start position:0%
we're remiss in the our current budget
 
00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
we have almost 60 million dollars that
 
00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
are assigned to the education Freedom
 
00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:38.220 align:start position:0%
accounts and their oversight is being
 
00:45:41.890 --> 00:45:41.900 align:start position:0%
administered by a non
 
00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:46.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Agency for oversight I
 
00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
just am asking with all due respect that
 
00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of
 
00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
Education have the oversight of the
 
00:45:58.490 --> 00:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts and if they
 
00:46:01.609 --> 00:46:01.619 align:start position:0%
choose to do an RFP to carry out that
 
00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:05.940 align:start position:0%
responsibility that would be fine but at
 
00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
least the Department of Education has
 
00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:10.740 align:start position:0%
oversight currently the way it stands
 
00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:13.020 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
the money is assigned it
 
00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:22.500 align:start position:0%
um uh the the private agency is the
 
00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
administer of those funds so it just
 
00:46:27.170 --> 00:46:27.180 align:start position:0%
it's it's not
 
00:46:29.930 --> 00:46:29.940 align:start position:0%
it's not the way we usually do things in
 
00:46:32.690 --> 00:46:32.700 align:start position:0%
the state and I just am very very
 
00:46:35.089 --> 00:46:35.099 align:start position:0%
concerned about it and I think this is
 
00:46:37.370 --> 00:46:37.380 align:start position:0%
an easy fix
 
00:46:39.650 --> 00:46:39.660 align:start position:0%
um and not necessarily
 
00:46:42.589 --> 00:46:42.599 align:start position:0%
a huge change but there'd be a process
 
00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
there'd be an RFP process we'd have we'd
 
00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
go through the right steps if we choose
 
00:46:51.589 --> 00:46:51.599 align:start position:0%
to do it the way that it's currently
 
00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
being done that's another story but at
 
00:46:56.809 --> 00:46:56.819 align:start position:0%
least we have the oversight of a state
 
00:46:59.450 --> 00:46:59.460 align:start position:0%
agency looking at where it's going I
 
00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
just think we're opening up ourselves
 
00:47:05.089 --> 00:47:05.099 align:start position:0%
for huge audit exceptions I ask that you
 
00:47:08.450 --> 00:47:08.460 align:start position:0%
vote no on the itl so an ought to pass
 
00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:11.640 align:start position:0%
motion can be made thank you very much
 
00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:14.220 align:start position:0%
the education committee was split on
 
00:47:16.809 --> 00:47:16.819 align:start position:0%
this and then it uh
 
00:47:18.770 --> 00:47:18.780 align:start position:0%
passed through the house when some
 
00:47:21.170 --> 00:47:21.180 align:start position:0%
people were absent and we ended up with
 
00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:22.190 align:start position:0%
people were absent and we ended up with
it

00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:23.270 align:start position:0%
it
um

00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:25.370 --> 00:47:25.380 align:start position:0%
the department of Ed I don't think took
 
00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
a position on this and I don't think
 
00:47:29.210 --> 00:47:29.220 align:start position:0%
they're prepared to take it over I hope
 
00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
you will support itl
 
00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:34.079 align:start position:0%
may I question
 
00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:35.940 align:start position:0%
over here
 
00:47:39.109 --> 00:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you oh yeah
 
00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:40.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:47:42.050 --> 00:47:42.060 align:start position:0%
um it seems to me that this is a
 
00:47:44.210 --> 00:47:44.220 align:start position:0%
reasonable and modest request that
 
00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
overall has a benefit to the state
 
00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
fiscally has a benefit to the state with
 
00:47:50.210 --> 00:47:50.220 align:start position:0%
regards to oversight of the program and
 
00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
a benefit with access to information it
 
00:47:53.809 --> 00:47:53.819 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to me that this is an
 
00:47:55.609 --> 00:47:55.619 align:start position:0%
onerous ask that this is doing anything
 
00:47:58.309 --> 00:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
other than being responsible to the
 
00:47:59.750 --> 00:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
students of New Hampshire to the
 
00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of New Hampshire I hope that
 
00:48:05.089 --> 00:48:05.099 align:start position:0%
we could override the itl to pass this
 
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
as I said this is just a reasonable
 
00:48:09.770 --> 00:48:09.780 align:start position:0%
modest request and it would be nice if
 
00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:11.220 align:start position:0%
we could move in this direction thank
 
00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:13.550 align:start position:0%
we could move in this direction thank
you

00:48:13.550 --> 00:48:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:16.010 --> 00:48:16.020 align:start position:0%
represent Hall
 
00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:19.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman in reviewing the
 
00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
language in section 6 relative to unused
 
00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:23.940 align:start position:0%
funds it does more than just move this
 
00:48:26.569 --> 00:48:26.579 align:start position:0%
over to the department it puts a cap on
 
00:48:28.490 --> 00:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
what funds could be rolled over year to
 
00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
year right and we all know that
 
00:48:32.930 --> 00:48:32.940 align:start position:0%
education gets more expensive in the
 
00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
latter years I I think that there's
 
00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:37.020 align:start position:0%
additional things going on with this
 
00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:39.480 align:start position:0%
amendment and Bill I would support the
 
00:48:41.870 --> 00:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
itl motion
 
00:48:45.829 --> 00:48:45.839 align:start position:0%
representative Edward uh thank you uh Mr
 
00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
chair I was simply just going to point
 
00:48:50.329 --> 00:48:50.339 align:start position:0%
out that when we heard this on the floor
 
00:48:53.089 --> 00:48:53.099 align:start position:0%
a member Rose and said that this could
 
00:48:55.069 --> 00:48:55.079 align:start position:0%
be done at the department with just a
 
00:48:57.170 --> 00:48:57.180 align:start position:0%
couple of personnel
 
00:48:59.630 --> 00:48:59.640 align:start position:0%
um and so I went and made some inquiries
 
00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
and I was told that they they brought on
 
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
10 to 12 people to handle the Surge and
 
00:49:08.569 --> 00:49:08.579 align:start position:0%
we all know that the private sector is
 
00:49:11.569 --> 00:49:11.579 align:start position:0%
much better to adapting it in changes to
 
00:49:16.309 --> 00:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
demand than the the public sector is uh
 
00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
I it was also pointed out that anytime
 
00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
they have any administrative savings
 
00:49:23.109 --> 00:49:23.119 align:start position:0%
they plow that money back into
 
00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
scholarships and and and all of that
 
00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
information is accessible because this
 
00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:32.940 align:start position:0%
fund is auditable or has had Audits and
 
00:49:36.410 --> 00:49:36.420 align:start position:0%
they put each student's account in an
 
00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
online manner so that all the expenses
 
00:49:42.650 --> 00:49:42.660 align:start position:0%
are transparent I'd also point out which
 
00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:45.240 align:start position:0%
I think you did uh that the the
 
00:49:47.809 --> 00:49:47.819 align:start position:0%
department is not requesting this this
 
00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
is a political request not a government
 
00:49:58.970 --> 00:49:58.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:00.890 --> 00:50:00.900 align:start position:0%
this time it's to speak
 
00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:03.300 align:start position:0%
this time I really do have a question Mr
 
00:50:05.569 --> 00:50:05.579 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you very much I just
 
00:50:07.849 --> 00:50:07.859 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask what the percentage is
 
00:50:10.250 --> 00:50:10.260 align:start position:0%
that the administrative body takes out
 
00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
I think it's 10 percent
 
00:50:21.109 --> 00:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
representative Heath
 
00:50:23.809 --> 00:50:23.819 align:start position:0%
thank you um Mr chair I just was
 
00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
actually going to say that the fact that
 
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
the um the current agency working with
 
00:50:35.089 --> 00:50:35.099 align:start position:0%
the FAS take a 10 off the top of every
 
00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:39.420 align:start position:0%
single EFA for administration of that
 
00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
um again I think if it went to the
 
00:50:43.309 --> 00:50:43.319 align:start position:0%
Department of Education for oversight
 
00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:45.839 align:start position:0%
there may still be some kind of a fee
 
00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:48.540 align:start position:0%
that's charged but again the Department
 
00:50:50.990 --> 00:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
of Education would have the authority
 
00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:53.640 align:start position:0%
over that agency right now there is none
 
00:50:58.430 --> 00:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
anything further from the committee
 
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:03.589 align:start position:0%
anything further from the committee
members

00:51:03.589 --> 00:51:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:05.940 align:start position:0%
yep representative Stringham thank you
 
00:51:06.829 --> 00:51:06.839 align:start position:0%
very much
 
00:51:09.829 --> 00:51:09.839 align:start position:0%
um I think it uh 10 no bid fee is not
 
00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
responsible for something of this large
 
00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:16.380 align:start position:0%
if if the 60 million uh that's projected
 
00:51:17.809 --> 00:51:17.819 align:start position:0%
to be in the budget we're talking about
 
00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:22.020 align:start position:0%
a six million dollar no bid contract and
 
00:51:24.109 --> 00:51:24.119 align:start position:0%
um uh you know it looks like the
 
00:51:25.970 --> 00:51:25.980 align:start position:0%
program's going to be here for a while I
 
00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:27.420 align:start position:0%
think it's time to bring it into the
 
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
department of Ed they can do the work
 
00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
themselves they can they can uh uh put
 
00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:35.640 align:start position:0%
out an RFP and have a contract that's
 
00:51:37.730 --> 00:51:37.740 align:start position:0%
the way it should be done and I plan to
 
00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
vote against the itl motion
 
00:51:41.930 --> 00:51:41.940 align:start position:0%
the bill does not cover all those things
 
00:51:43.790 --> 00:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
you discussed
 
00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:49.370 --> 00:51:49.380 align:start position:0%
seeing none the clerk will call the roll
 
00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:51.720 align:start position:0%
the motion is inexpedient to legislate
 
00:51:55.609 --> 00:51:55.619 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 626.
 
00:51:57.190 --> 00:51:57.200 align:start position:0%

voicing gratitude to the LBA uh and on
 
01:18:31.550 --> 01:18:31.560 align:start position:0%
and to the department but um just based
 
01:18:35.810 --> 01:18:35.820 align:start position:0%
on the amount of work that Mr Ripple had
 
01:18:39.550 --> 01:18:39.560 align:start position:0%
thrown at him in the last 12 hours
 
01:18:41.689 --> 01:18:41.699 align:start position:0%
yesterday's gratitude needs to be

more productive and so this is uh the
 
01:20:09.890 --> 01:20:09.900 align:start position:0%
I.T approach to evolving their uh their
 
01:20:13.010 --> 01:20:13.020 align:start position:0%
eligibility system and Crossing more and
 
01:20:17.149 --> 01:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
more areas so this this will fund an
 
01:20:19.130 --> 01:20:19.140 align:start position:0%
audit of that eligibility system because
 
01:20:21.770 --> 01:20:21.780 align:start position:0%
as they expand the scope of what it does
 
01:20:24.410 --> 01:20:24.420 align:start position:0%
they have to make sure that they're they
 
01:20:28.189 --> 01:20:28.199 align:start position:0%
meet the terms of compliance so this was
 
01:20:31.930 --> 01:20:31.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:37.070 --> 01:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
2023-1172 hotel and it's now in the hb2
 
01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:39.910 align:start position:0%
2023-1172 hotel and it's now in the hb2
packet

01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:43.250 --> 01:20:43.260 align:start position:0%
next item is um
 
01:20:46.370 --> 01:20:46.380 align:start position:0%
lines 9 and 10.
 
01:20:49.130 --> 01:20:49.140 align:start position:0%
this is a pretty significant amount of
 
01:20:49.140 --> 01:20:49.930 align:start position:0%
this is a pretty significant amount of
money

01:20:49.930 --> 01:20:49.940 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
the first the top line on the 20.5
 
01:20:55.970 --> 01:20:55.980 align:start position:0%
million is General the bottom line or
 
01:20:58.330 --> 01:20:58.340 align:start position:0%
the next line down is
 
01:21:01.910 --> 01:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
65.688 over the biennium that that
 
01:21:04.430 --> 01:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
second amount is the budget Federal the
 
01:21:06.350 --> 01:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
federal matching funds that come with
 
01:21:09.050 --> 01:21:09.060 align:start position:0%
the general funds so
 
01:21:12.290 --> 01:21:12.300 align:start position:0%
um this is to me an absolutely shocking
 
01:21:16.729 --> 01:21:16.739 align:start position:0%
amount of money uh and I uh and and but
 
01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:18.719 align:start position:0%
we're we're moving this out of House
 
01:21:21.669 --> 01:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 and into house bill one because
 
01:21:24.770 --> 01:21:24.780 align:start position:0%
it's it's really operations and
 
01:21:26.750 --> 01:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
maintenance and not a major systems
 
01:21:28.970 --> 01:21:28.980 align:start position:0%
upgrade and so as an operations and
 
01:21:31.610 --> 01:21:31.620 align:start position:0%
maintenance item despite the enormity of
 
01:21:36.169 --> 01:21:36.179 align:start position:0%
it it really belongs uh in hb1 so this
 
01:21:38.450 --> 01:21:38.460 align:start position:0%
is a no-cost move
 
01:21:41.870 --> 01:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
um but it does make it more transparent
 
01:21:45.950 --> 01:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
we did that in Amendment 1059 hotel and
 
01:21:49.430 --> 01:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
a prove that then
 
01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
next line item question go ahead
 
01:21:55.550 --> 01:21:55.560 align:start position:0%
question representative McGuire thank
 
01:21:57.530 --> 01:21:57.540 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:22:01.090 --> 01:22:01.100 align:start position:0%
um is Medicaid now generally a 3X plus
 
01:22:04.790 --> 01:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
matching this seems awfully high no
 
01:22:07.610 --> 01:22:07.620 align:start position:0%
I I this this is a correct matching
 
01:22:10.610 --> 01:22:10.620 align:start position:0%
number and I don't see uh Mr White do
 
01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
you want to talk to the matching uh
 
01:22:15.050 --> 01:22:15.060 align:start position:0%
because that is a high match
 
01:22:16.550 --> 01:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
he's back there but Medicaid is
 
01:22:18.830 --> 01:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
typically 50 50 but in the case of mmis
 
01:22:22.490 --> 01:22:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:25.790 --> 01:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:28.090 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
um

01:22:28.090 --> 01:22:28.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:33.790 --> 01:22:33.800 align:start position:0%
next lines 13 and 14 uh the the the
 
01:22:36.410 --> 01:22:36.420 align:start position:0%
Undisputed subject matter expert on this
 
01:22:38.990 --> 01:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
is a representative erf this is the
 
01:22:40.729 --> 01:22:40.739 align:start position:0%
second year that we've done something
 
01:22:43.490 --> 01:22:43.500 align:start position:0%
different uh we discussed it at length
 
01:22:50.090 --> 01:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:53.350 --> 01:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
um and uh the these these monies
 
01:22:56.630 --> 01:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
represent the general funds money that
 
01:22:59.390 --> 01:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
will go to the counties uh in the case
 
01:23:01.790 --> 01:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
of Hillsboro or not Hillsborough my
 
01:23:04.189 --> 01:23:04.199 align:start position:0%
county is Rockingham County the case of
 
01:23:07.610 --> 01:23:07.620 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County the CFO told me that
 
01:23:09.890 --> 01:23:09.900 align:start position:0%
this change in what we did for them the
 
01:23:11.870 --> 01:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
last term that we're carrying into this
 
01:23:15.169 --> 01:23:15.179 align:start position:0%
term at the exact same rate or the same
 
01:23:19.490 --> 01:23:19.500 align:start position:0%
dollar amount uh shaved seven percentage
 
01:23:21.530 --> 01:23:21.540 align:start position:0%
points off of the county share of the
 
01:23:24.709 --> 01:23:24.719 align:start position:0%
property tax so so if you vote for this
 
01:23:26.830 --> 01:23:26.840 align:start position:0%
keep in mind that you should tell your
 
01:23:29.330 --> 01:23:29.340 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that we we are actually doing
 
01:23:31.550 --> 01:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
something to reduce their candidate
 
01:23:34.490 --> 01:23:34.500 align:start position:0%
County property taxes
 
01:23:38.209 --> 01:23:38.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:38.219 --> 01:23:39.110 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:46.030 --> 01:23:46.040 align:start position:0%
food protection on lines uh 17 and 18.
 
01:23:49.790 --> 01:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
this was a prioritized need request from
 
01:23:53.450 --> 01:23:53.460 align:start position:0%
the Department uh what this does is
 
01:23:56.510 --> 01:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
allows them to pay overtime during the
 
01:24:00.169 --> 01:24:00.179 align:start position:0%
busy recreational summer months they're
 
01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
going out to the they spent a lot more
 
01:24:06.590 --> 01:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
time at the recreation recreational hot
 
01:24:09.709 --> 01:24:09.719 align:start position:0%
spots food trucks that sort of thing
 
01:24:11.390 --> 01:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure that we don't have
 
01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
any foodborne illnesses spread because I
 
01:24:17.930 --> 01:24:17.940 align:start position:0%
think we all know what an outbreak would
 
01:24:21.229 --> 01:24:21.239 align:start position:0%
do to our reputation our tourism so so
 
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
what the if if we didn't give them this
 
01:24:25.370 --> 01:24:25.380 align:start position:0%
money what they would end up having to
 
01:24:27.890 --> 01:24:27.900 align:start position:0%
do is is take their existing employees
 
01:24:29.990 --> 01:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
and work around and give them
 
01:24:32.330 --> 01:24:32.340 align:start position:0%
uncompensated time off later in the year
 
01:24:35.290 --> 01:24:35.300 align:start position:0%
so so this is this just seemed to me to
 
01:24:38.330 --> 01:24:38.340 align:start position:0%
fit fit the surge requirement I don't
 
01:24:39.709 --> 01:24:39.719 align:start position:0%
believe we talked about about this
 
01:24:42.050 --> 01:24:42.060 align:start position:0%
yesterday though so if there are any
 
01:24:45.709 --> 01:24:45.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:47.930 --> 01:24:47.940 align:start position:0%
okay I'm not I'm not saying anything Mr
 
01:24:47.940 --> 01:24:49.550 align:start position:0%
okay I'm not I'm not saying anything Mr
chair

01:24:49.550 --> 01:24:49.560 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:24:53.510 --> 01:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
um okay so so number 19. a
 
01:24:55.370 --> 01:24:55.380 align:start position:0%
representative kofault I think it was
 
01:24:56.750 --> 01:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
really good that he was here yesterday
 
01:24:59.990 --> 01:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
because he uh he he shook me a little
 
01:25:02.510 --> 01:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
bit and he said hey you know that the
 
01:25:04.370 --> 01:25:04.380 align:start position:0%
house bill that did the wick
 
01:25:06.590 --> 01:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
supplemental nutrition program for three
 
01:25:09.290 --> 01:25:09.300 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars a year was was
 
01:25:13.490 --> 01:25:13.500 align:start position:0%
killed in on the floor uh and I had not
 
01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
recalled that uh and so so I I think
 
01:25:20.090 --> 01:25:20.100 align:start position:0%
it's inappropriate for us to go ahead
 
01:25:22.430 --> 01:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
and put that money in when when the
 
01:25:26.870 --> 01:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
house policy didn't meet it but uh with
 
01:25:31.669 --> 01:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
that 300 and 300 we have uh an amendment
 
01:25:34.250 --> 01:25:34.260 align:start position:0%
that I'd like to offer Mr chair at this
 
01:25:36.229 --> 01:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
point this seems like a good a good
 
01:25:38.930 --> 01:25:38.940 align:start position:0%
point to bring it up
 
01:25:42.229 --> 01:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
um as Mr Ripple hands out the amendment
 
01:25:42.239 --> 01:25:42.950 align:start position:0%
um as Mr Ripple hands out the amendment
um

01:25:42.950 --> 01:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:45.310 --> 01:25:45.320 align:start position:0%
let me describe it
 
01:25:47.209 --> 01:25:47.219 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney I've been
 
01:25:50.510 --> 01:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
struggling all day on the proper name of
 
01:25:53.450 --> 01:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
that organization the home visits
 
01:25:58.810 --> 01:25:58.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:02.209 --> 01:26:02.219 align:start position:0%
m-i-e-c-h-v maternal infant and early
 
01:26:06.530 --> 01:26:06.540 align:start position:0%
development home visiting so so this was
 
01:26:10.850 --> 01:26:10.860 align:start position:0%
a program that had asked for money that
 
01:26:13.370 --> 01:26:13.380 align:start position:0%
hadn't uh completely made it into the
 
01:26:16.610 --> 01:26:16.620 align:start position:0%
way into the governor's budget there was
 
01:26:21.110 --> 01:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
um it came over to us with a 109 well
 
01:26:23.030 --> 01:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
we'll call it a hundred and ten thousand
 
01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
dollars on the governor's budget they
 
01:26:29.629 --> 01:26:29.639 align:start position:0%
requested a very large increase from 110
 
01:26:34.850 --> 01:26:34.860 align:start position:0%
to 525 and what this amendment proposes
 
01:26:38.570 --> 01:26:38.580 align:start position:0%
this amendment proposes that uh instead
 
01:26:42.649 --> 01:26:42.659 align:start position:0%
of agreeing to their 525 increase we're
 
01:26:45.649 --> 01:26:45.659 align:start position:0%
we're taking the 300 that just got freed
 
01:26:47.629 --> 01:26:47.639 align:start position:0%
up by the WIC supplemental nutrition
 
01:26:47.639 --> 01:26:48.709 align:start position:0%
up by the WIC supplemental nutrition
program

01:26:48.709 --> 01:26:48.719 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:26:52.970 --> 01:26:52.980 align:start position:0%
so um so I only had a brief moment to
 
01:26:55.370 --> 01:26:55.380 align:start position:0%
discuss this with representative Wallner
 
01:26:58.910 --> 01:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
before this uh and you know if she has
 
01:27:00.770 --> 01:27:00.780 align:start position:0%
any comments
 
01:27:02.629 --> 01:27:02.639 align:start position:0%
um and now that she's seen it or
 
01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:10.189 --> 01:27:10.199 align:start position:0%
any questions or discussion from
 
01:27:11.629 --> 01:27:11.639 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
01:27:16.129 --> 01:27:16.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:16.139 --> 01:27:17.330 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:27:17.330 --> 01:27:17.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:20.930 --> 01:27:20.940 align:start position:0%
this is the first time I'm seeing this
 
01:27:22.790 --> 01:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
um everyone on division three
 
01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:25.500 align:start position:0%
we were within the last two hours of our
 
01:27:26.750 --> 01:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
work day
 
01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:28.189 align:start position:0%
work day
when

01:27:28.189 --> 01:27:28.199 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:27:31.669 --> 01:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
I requested we discuss this
 
01:27:33.470 --> 01:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
line item
 
01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:35.390 align:start position:0%
line item
19.

01:27:35.390 --> 01:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
19.
 
01:27:37.010 --> 01:27:37.020 align:start position:0%
and those of you who were there know
 
01:27:38.450 --> 01:27:38.460 align:start position:0%
that I was quite
 
01:27:38.460 --> 01:27:40.250 align:start position:0%
that I was quite
enthusiastic

01:27:40.250 --> 01:27:40.260 align:start position:0%
enthusiastic
 
01:27:42.830 --> 01:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
and impassioned about this program
 
01:27:45.950 --> 01:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
and we did discuss that it had come to
 
01:27:48.709 --> 01:27:48.719 align:start position:0%
the floor and had not passed and was
 
01:27:52.669 --> 01:27:52.679 align:start position:0%
that a priority item for the Department
 
01:27:55.370 --> 01:27:55.380 align:start position:0%
we had
 
01:27:58.310 --> 01:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
a detailed discussion on the pros and
 
01:28:01.070 --> 01:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
cons and in the end
 
01:28:03.950 --> 01:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
the division voted in a bipartisan way
 
01:28:06.950 --> 01:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
to put it in hb1 with a vote of six to
 
01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:08.990 align:start position:0%
to put it in hb1 with a vote of six to
three

01:28:08.990 --> 01:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:28:10.850 --> 01:28:10.860 align:start position:0%
and I am
 
01:28:12.950 --> 01:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
disappointed that this is the first time
 
01:28:14.990 --> 01:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing about this
 
01:28:17.270 --> 01:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
and I wish that the sponsor of this
 
01:28:18.530 --> 01:28:18.540 align:start position:0%
amendment could have discussed it with
 
01:28:20.930 --> 01:28:20.940 align:start position:0%
me prior
 
01:28:23.870 --> 01:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
at the same time I understand the need
 
01:28:26.870 --> 01:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
for the home visiting money
 
01:28:29.689 --> 01:28:29.699 align:start position:0%
as we also attempted to fund that on
 
01:28:33.649 --> 01:28:33.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:36.350 --> 01:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
so while I understand the importance
 
01:28:38.930 --> 01:28:38.940 align:start position:0%
of both
 
01:28:40.550 --> 01:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm going to sit and see if
 
01:28:42.050 --> 01:28:42.060 align:start position:0%
there's more discussion but I just
 
01:28:43.970 --> 01:28:43.980 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that I set the
 
01:28:46.250 --> 01:28:46.260 align:start position:0%
record straight that we did discuss the
 
01:28:48.530 --> 01:28:48.540 align:start position:0%
WIC program quite extensively on our
 
01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:50.639 align:start position:0%
last night of work thank you for letting
 
01:28:51.590 --> 01:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
me speak
 
01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
so I I would say to that that because
 
01:28:57.709 --> 01:28:57.719 align:start position:0%
you had a particular passion on it I I
 
01:29:00.110 --> 01:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
would yeah you you're more likely to
 
01:29:02.990 --> 01:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
remember it accurately I I'm just saying
 
01:29:06.709 --> 01:29:06.719 align:start position:0%
that my recollection is that that I
 
01:29:09.290 --> 01:29:09.300 align:start position:0%
don't recall us talking about the bill
 
01:29:11.950 --> 01:29:11.960 align:start position:0%
being it old on the floor
 
01:29:14.149 --> 01:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
that's something that probably just got
 
01:29:17.330 --> 01:29:17.340 align:start position:0%
by me or because that that is a
 
01:29:20.510 --> 01:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
significant fact to me but um but I
 
01:29:22.910 --> 01:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
don't I don't disagree with you I just
 
01:29:29.149 --> 01:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:31.370 --> 01:29:31.380 align:start position:0%
usually the things that pass the house
 
01:29:33.290 --> 01:29:33.300 align:start position:0%
we try to put in the budget but if
 
01:29:40.010 --> 01:29:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:40.020 --> 01:29:41.390 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:29:41.390 --> 01:29:41.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:29:45.890 --> 01:29:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:48.649 --> 01:29:48.659 align:start position:0%
well this is a difficult choice because
 
01:29:50.930 --> 01:29:50.940 align:start position:0%
both of these programs are really needed
 
01:29:50.940 --> 01:29:51.970 align:start position:0%
both of these programs are really needed
by

01:29:51.970 --> 01:29:51.980 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:29:54.350 --> 01:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
low-income families in New Hampshire so
 
01:29:56.810 --> 01:29:56.820 align:start position:0%
if this is a very very difficult choice
 
01:29:59.570 --> 01:29:59.580 align:start position:0%
and I think that we did vote in our
 
01:30:03.410 --> 01:30:03.420 align:start position:0%
division to include the WIC program the
 
01:30:04.850 --> 01:30:04.860 align:start position:0%
funding for it
 
01:30:08.570 --> 01:30:08.580 align:start position:0%
and the home visiting program also is
 
01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
extremely important in that
 
01:30:15.050 --> 01:30:15.060 align:start position:0%
um it does have it also has a very a
 
01:30:19.610 --> 01:30:19.620 align:start position:0%
very substantial Federal match and would
 
01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
really benefit the families
 
01:30:24.290 --> 01:30:24.300 align:start position:0%
but at this point I think I'm going to
 
01:30:26.030 --> 01:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
vote I think I'm going to vote no on it
 
01:30:28.129 --> 01:30:28.139 align:start position:0%
because I just heard about it
 
01:30:30.709 --> 01:30:30.719 align:start position:0%
well just before we right when we broke
 
01:30:30.719 --> 01:30:32.330 align:start position:0%
well just before we right when we broke
and

01:30:32.330 --> 01:30:32.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:30:32.340 --> 01:30:32.990 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:30:32.990 --> 01:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:36.169 --> 01:30:36.179 align:start position:0%
I just don't like the idea of these
 
01:30:39.890 --> 01:30:39.900 align:start position:0%
coming in as one trade-off for the other
 
01:30:44.590 --> 01:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:48.229 --> 01:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
so represent Weiler we are bringing this
 
01:30:50.330 --> 01:30:50.340 align:start position:0%
rather late and
 
01:30:52.310 --> 01:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
um I don't need to bring this amendment
 
01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:53.750 align:start position:0%
um I don't need to bring this amendment
forward

01:30:53.750 --> 01:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:30:56.350 --> 01:30:56.360 align:start position:0%
um but I I based on
 
01:30:59.149 --> 01:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
understanding now that this item got it
 
01:31:02.750 --> 01:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
yelled uh I I would be ready to make a
 
01:31:06.229 --> 01:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
motion to delete line 19 from the
 
01:31:09.410 --> 01:31:09.420 align:start position:0%
recommendations and save the 600 000
 
01:31:11.270 --> 01:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
because we've got a lot of different
 
01:31:13.250 --> 01:31:13.260 align:start position:0%
ways to spend six hundred thousand
 
01:31:15.110 --> 01:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
dollars not the least of which is to
 
01:31:17.270 --> 01:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
improve our Medicaid reimbursement rates
 
01:31:21.050 --> 01:31:21.060 align:start position:0%
so so the first motion I would make if
 
01:31:24.850 --> 01:31:24.860 align:start position:0%
if I could you may uh is I would like to
 
01:31:38.470 --> 01:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:42.410 --> 01:31:42.420 align:start position:0%
what are you waving at no question I'll
 
01:31:45.350 --> 01:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
second emotion okay discussion
 
01:31:48.530 --> 01:31:48.540 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren well uh
 
01:31:52.490 --> 01:31:52.500 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if maybe we all have
 
01:31:55.189 --> 01:31:55.199 align:start position:0%
issues in Remembering exactly what
 
01:31:57.290 --> 01:31:57.300 align:start position:0%
happened but often what happens on the
 
01:32:01.189 --> 01:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
floor is that a bill will be voted itl
 
01:32:03.709 --> 01:32:03.719 align:start position:0%
when we know we're dealing with it in
 
01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
finance so I'm wondering if maybe we're
 
01:32:09.709 --> 01:32:09.719 align:start position:0%
all sort of forgetting
 
01:32:12.709 --> 01:32:12.719 align:start position:0%
parts of what happened on the floor and
 
01:32:17.330 --> 01:32:17.340 align:start position:0%
that we should be including it as we see
 
01:32:20.390 --> 01:32:20.400 align:start position:0%
it here as as we like to say to one
 
01:32:22.250 --> 01:32:22.260 align:start position:0%
another whenever it's the right time for
 
01:32:25.070 --> 01:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
us to say it uh there's the policy
 
01:32:26.510 --> 01:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
Choice and then there's a financial
 
01:32:29.209 --> 01:32:29.219 align:start position:0%
choice in the and the body is fairly
 
01:32:31.010 --> 01:32:31.020 align:start position:0%
well trained on when they're doing what
 
01:32:33.590 --> 01:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
so the previous failure for this to pass
 
01:32:36.169 --> 01:32:36.179 align:start position:0%
on the floor was a policy vote then it
 
01:32:38.689 --> 01:32:38.699 align:start position:0%
comes to us for the financial vote and
 
01:32:40.490 --> 01:32:40.500 align:start position:0%
in this case I'm not comfortable going
 
01:32:42.950 --> 01:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
forward realizing that this policy
 
01:32:45.290 --> 01:32:45.300 align:start position:0%
failed on the floor as a matter of
 
01:32:45.300 --> 01:32:46.850 align:start position:0%
failed on the floor as a matter of
policy

01:32:46.850 --> 01:32:46.860 align:start position:0%
policy
 
01:32:52.370 --> 01:32:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:54.530 --> 01:32:54.540 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the motion to
 
01:32:58.910 --> 01:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
delete line 19 on hb1 here before us
 
01:33:00.770 --> 01:33:00.780 align:start position:0%
representative Holm
 
01:33:02.990 --> 01:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:33:06.530 --> 01:33:06.540 align:start position:0%
um I believe this was house bill 574. it
 
01:33:08.930 --> 01:33:08.940 align:start position:0%
came out as an auto pass motion and was
 
01:33:12.410 --> 01:33:12.420 align:start position:0%
in fact defeated and then laid on the
 
01:33:15.530 --> 01:33:15.540 align:start position:0%
table and then voted in which also
 
01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
failed and then in expedient to
 
01:33:19.790 --> 01:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
legislate so
 
01:33:21.530 --> 01:33:21.540 align:start position:0%
um the house has made a decision on this
 
01:33:26.570 --> 01:33:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:29.629 --> 01:33:29.639 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
01:33:32.510 --> 01:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
what shall we label uh or just the
 
01:33:34.790 --> 01:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
amendment will just be deletion of line
 
01:33:38.750 --> 01:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
19. yeah strike row 19. further
 
01:33:41.450 --> 01:33:41.460 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none clerk will call a
 
01:33:44.270 --> 01:33:44.280 align:start position:0%

um Mr chair if it's appropriate now I
 
01:35:10.610 --> 01:35:10.620 align:start position:0%
would like to make a motion uh to to
 
01:35:14.689 --> 01:35:14.699 align:start position:0%
pass an hb1 amendment the description of
 
01:35:17.209 --> 01:35:17.219 align:start position:0%
this is to fund the home visiting
 
01:35:18.890 --> 01:35:18.900 align:start position:0%
formula grant with three hundred
 
01:35:20.450 --> 01:35:20.460 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per year of General
 
01:35:22.790 --> 01:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
funds that were previously budgeted for
 
01:35:25.090 --> 01:35:25.100 align:start position:0%
the Wic Farmers Market program
 
01:35:28.910 --> 01:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
as was mentioned before uh this this
 
01:35:32.330 --> 01:35:32.340 align:start position:0%
this may have a nice Federal match to it
 
01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:38.990 --> 01:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
the Department's request did not include
 
01:35:41.810 --> 01:35:41.820 align:start position:0%
a federal matching number so this is
 
01:35:44.390 --> 01:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
yeah their prioritized needs request was
 
01:35:47.209 --> 01:35:47.219 align:start position:0%
General funds only okay but if we if we
 
01:35:50.149 --> 01:35:50.159 align:start position:0%
if we go ahead and and do the general
 
01:35:52.430 --> 01:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
funds they can later go back and ask for
 
01:35:55.310 --> 01:35:55.320 align:start position:0%
additional federal funds or or have we
 
01:35:57.110 --> 01:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
missed that window
 
01:35:59.390 --> 01:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
possibly I'm not sure if it applies to
 
01:36:02.570 --> 01:36:02.580 align:start position:0%
this program or not okay all right
 
01:36:02.580 --> 01:36:03.410 align:start position:0%
this program or not okay all right
um

01:36:03.410 --> 01:36:03.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:06.770 --> 01:36:06.780 align:start position:0%
there there are some other federal funds
 
01:36:09.229 --> 01:36:09.239 align:start position:0%
Associated here so presumably there's a
 
01:36:09.239 --> 01:36:10.250 align:start position:0%
Associated here so presumably there's a
match

01:36:10.250 --> 01:36:10.260 align:start position:0%
match
 
01:36:13.850 --> 01:36:13.860 align:start position:0%
um so I I would I would move this to
 
01:36:18.830 --> 01:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:20.450 --> 01:36:20.460 align:start position:0%
further discussion from committee
 
01:36:21.950 --> 01:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
members what's the what's the motion
 
01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
I guess it doesn't have a number Mr
 
01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:31.570 align:start position:0%
I guess it doesn't have a number Mr
Ripple

01:36:31.570 --> 01:36:31.580 align:start position:0%
Ripple
 
01:36:36.530 --> 01:36:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
um can you refresh my memory on the
 
01:36:42.169 --> 01:36:42.179 align:start position:0%
amount that the department had requested
 
01:36:45.470 --> 01:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
that we hadn't funded yet what we passed
 
01:36:47.689 --> 01:36:47.699 align:start position:0%
which I believe was a percentage and
 
01:36:50.870 --> 01:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
where this 300 000 will leave us
 
01:36:54.970 --> 01:36:54.980 align:start position:0%
for for this the the department being
 
01:36:58.430 --> 01:36:58.440 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget uh was just under
 
01:37:00.770 --> 01:37:00.780 align:start position:0%
a hundred and ten thousand the
 
01:37:03.830 --> 01:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
department uh then had a prioritized
 
01:37:07.250 --> 01:37:07.260 align:start position:0%
need of an additional 525
 
01:37:10.610 --> 01:37:10.620 align:start position:0%
000. so what we would be doing is we
 
01:37:11.709 --> 01:37:11.719 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:37:15.950 --> 01:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
giving most of the prioritize need 300
 
01:37:18.890 --> 01:37:18.900 align:start position:0%
000 of the 525 extra
 
01:37:21.229 --> 01:37:21.239 align:start position:0%
to the department so that they could
 
01:37:21.239 --> 01:37:22.149 align:start position:0%
to the department so that they could
support

01:37:22.149 --> 01:37:22.159 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:37:25.850 --> 01:37:25.860 align:start position:0%
the home visiting formula grant
 
01:37:25.860 --> 01:37:29.450 align:start position:0%
the home visiting formula grant
follow-up

01:37:29.450 --> 01:37:29.460 align:start position:0%

01:37:32.580 --> 01:37:33.770 align:start position:0%
line item for the prioritized request in
the

01:37:33.770 --> 01:37:33.780 align:start position:0%

the
Millions

01:37:35.689 --> 01:37:35.699 align:start position:0%
Millions
 
01:37:38.750 --> 01:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
no there are millions once you had the
 
01:37:39.830 --> 01:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
federal money
 
01:37:42.590 --> 01:37:42.600 align:start position:0%
but here you you can look at this and
 
01:37:58.790 --> 01:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:59.930 --> 01:37:59.940 align:start position:0%
thank you for the clarification
 
01:38:04.250 --> 01:38:04.260 align:start position:0%

has a hard time I'm saying yes I have
 
01:39:40.970 --> 01:39:40.980 align:start position:0%
said yes
 
01:39:43.729 --> 01:39:43.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:46.850 --> 01:39:46.860 align:start position:0%
I I heard yes so hopefully that's what
 
01:39:48.229 --> 01:39:48.239 align:start position:0%
it was
 
01:39:51.229 --> 01:39:51.239 align:start position:0%
so uh thank you Mr chair should I keep
 
01:39:53.629 --> 01:39:53.639 align:start position:0%
moving through the spreadsheet please do
 
01:39:58.610 --> 01:39:58.620 align:start position:0%
okay uh row 20 on page two
 
01:40:00.709 --> 01:40:00.719 align:start position:0%
um this is uh this could really be
 
01:40:03.470 --> 01:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
categorized as a technical adjustment uh
 
01:40:06.950 --> 01:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
this is intended to uh take hb2 and
 
01:40:08.750 --> 01:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
reduce the federal funds so that it
 
01:40:11.629 --> 01:40:11.639 align:start position:0%
aligns with the actual amount and a
 
01:40:14.330 --> 01:40:14.340 align:start position:0%
Federal grant award
 
01:40:14.340 --> 01:40:15.890 align:start position:0%
Federal grant award
um

01:40:15.890 --> 01:40:15.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:18.189 --> 01:40:18.199 align:start position:0%
there's not much to say there
 
01:40:20.629 --> 01:40:20.639 align:start position:0%
uh item
 
01:40:20.639 --> 01:40:22.570 align:start position:0%
uh item
23

01:40:22.570 --> 01:40:22.580 align:start position:0%
23
 
01:40:26.270 --> 01:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
uh this is for the Glencliff home we did
 
01:40:28.850 --> 01:40:28.860 align:start position:0%
not make any change to uh their their
 
01:40:34.370 --> 01:40:34.380 align:start position:0%
request uh item 26 uh the Prevention
 
01:40:37.310 --> 01:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
Services and this is a program that was
 
01:40:40.669 --> 01:40:40.679 align:start position:0%
requested by representative tolersky uh
 
01:40:42.649 --> 01:40:42.659 align:start position:0%
this is I think the first time that the
 
01:40:46.370 --> 01:40:46.380 align:start position:0%
general funds have been set up to be
 
01:40:51.950 --> 01:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
appropriated to a collaboration of five
 
01:40:54.590 --> 01:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
different organizations working on
 
01:40:58.490 --> 01:40:58.500 align:start position:0%
substance abuse issues the initial
 
01:41:01.010 --> 01:41:01.020 align:start position:0%
request was 625
 
01:41:05.209 --> 01:41:05.219 align:start position:0%
000 total or per year and and um and we
 
01:41:08.930 --> 01:41:08.940 align:start position:0%
reduced it to 200 000 and I I personally
 
01:41:11.450 --> 01:41:11.460 align:start position:0%
was confused over how the match would
 
01:41:13.790 --> 01:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
work so I I thought until we could
 
01:41:15.410 --> 01:41:15.420 align:start position:0%
figure it out and given this is the
 
01:41:17.750 --> 01:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
first year two hundred thousand dollars
 
01:41:23.149 --> 01:41:23.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:26.030 --> 01:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
um on 27
 
01:41:28.189 --> 01:41:28.199 align:start position:0%
I think there are two but this is
 
01:41:29.570 --> 01:41:29.580 align:start position:0%
certainly the first one we've come
 
01:41:31.669 --> 01:41:31.679 align:start position:0%
across this is
 
01:41:33.950 --> 01:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
um related to
 
01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:34.729 align:start position:0%
um related to
um

01:41:34.729 --> 01:41:34.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:39.290 --> 01:41:39.300 align:start position:0%
some ear marking of commission funds for
 
01:41:42.070 --> 01:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
the alcohol and drug abuse commission
 
01:41:46.129 --> 01:41:46.139 align:start position:0%
and the the net of this is a 2.1 over
 
01:41:49.550 --> 01:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
the biennium what we've what we're
 
01:41:53.810 --> 01:41:53.820 align:start position:0%
trying to do is with HB
 
01:42:00.530 --> 01:42:00.540 align:start position:0%
um 223 1204 is to safeguard the
 
01:42:02.890 --> 01:42:02.900 align:start position:0%
legislative commitment for five percent
 
01:42:06.830 --> 01:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
of the alcohol sales to go to the
 
01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:07.930 align:start position:0%
of the alcohol sales to go to the
commission

01:42:07.930 --> 01:42:07.940 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:42:10.910 --> 01:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
that number has has historically been
 
01:42:13.070 --> 01:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
more in the four percent range it's been
 
01:42:15.290 --> 01:42:15.300 align:start position:0%
a little lower if you go back in history
 
01:42:18.350 --> 01:42:18.360 align:start position:0%
even further so this is the first time
 
01:42:20.450 --> 01:42:20.460 align:start position:0%
that we're going to you know explicitly
 
01:42:22.430 --> 01:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
make our commitment that we said five
 
01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
percent we mean five percent uh and and
 
01:42:27.850 --> 01:42:27.860 align:start position:0%
here it is
 
01:42:31.490 --> 01:42:31.500 align:start position:0%
and you can see the math that on revenue
 
01:42:34.729 --> 01:42:34.739 align:start position:0%
of 11.1 million how much that would be
 
01:42:39.229 --> 01:42:39.239 align:start position:0%
so this is a A plus up to them of 2.1
 
01:42:43.189 --> 01:42:43.199 align:start position:0%
million over the biennium
 
01:42:45.709 --> 01:42:45.719 align:start position:0%
not seeing any comments there the next
 
01:42:50.629 --> 01:42:50.639 align:start position:0%
one is line 29 and 30 under the system
 
01:42:52.970 --> 01:42:52.980 align:start position:0%
of care
 
01:42:56.629 --> 01:42:56.639 align:start position:0%
uh what we wanted to do was to increase
 
01:42:58.310 --> 01:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
the funding to pay for the children
 
01:43:00.850 --> 01:43:00.860 align:start position:0%
residential rates
 
01:43:05.149 --> 01:43:05.159 align:start position:0%
we looked at what the the governor had
 
01:43:07.129 --> 01:43:07.139 align:start position:0%
asked we looked for the at the
 
01:43:10.370 --> 01:43:10.380 align:start position:0%
prioritized need request and it was such
 
01:43:12.649 --> 01:43:12.659 align:start position:0%
a large amount of money that what we
 
01:43:15.530 --> 01:43:15.540 align:start position:0%
ended up doing was allocating 60 percent
 
01:43:18.290 --> 01:43:18.300 align:start position:0%
of the Delta between the governor's
 
01:43:20.629 --> 01:43:20.639 align:start position:0%
request and and the prioritized need
 
01:43:23.270 --> 01:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
request so we tried to take care of most
 
01:43:25.729 --> 01:43:25.739 align:start position:0%
of it and that and that's what that that
 
01:43:29.270 --> 01:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
funding is uh is this is line 30 that's
 
01:43:32.090 --> 01:43:32.100 align:start position:0%
Federal money isn't it and that's the
 
01:43:35.930 --> 01:43:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:35.940 --> 01:43:38.030 align:start position:0%
 
on

01:43:38.030 --> 01:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:40.609 align:start position:0%
on
um

01:43:40.609 --> 01:43:40.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:40.619 --> 01:43:41.750 align:start position:0%
 
question

01:43:41.750 --> 01:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:43:44.689 --> 01:43:44.699 align:start position:0%
representative Walnut thank you
 
01:43:46.729 --> 01:43:46.739 align:start position:0%
um back to the system of care
 
01:43:49.490 --> 01:43:49.500 align:start position:0%
money money for just a minute
 
01:43:49.500 --> 01:43:51.470 align:start position:0%
money money for just a minute
um

01:43:51.470 --> 01:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:53.390 --> 01:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
I think I heard
 
01:43:56.270 --> 01:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
the department talk about this
 
01:43:56.280 --> 01:43:57.649 align:start position:0%
the department talk about this
when

01:43:57.649 --> 01:43:57.659 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:44:01.609 --> 01:44:01.619 align:start position:0%
um we were here that evening and what
 
01:44:04.010 --> 01:44:04.020 align:start position:0%
they were saying is that when they
 
01:44:04.020 --> 01:44:05.390 align:start position:0%
they were saying is that when they
originally

01:44:05.390 --> 01:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
originally
 
01:44:08.870 --> 01:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
started going out for these contracts
 
01:44:11.450 --> 01:44:11.460 align:start position:0%
the contracts came in
 
01:44:14.689 --> 01:44:14.699 align:start position:0%
a certain amount providers bid on them
 
01:44:17.750 --> 01:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
and they were awarded but as the
 
01:44:19.729 --> 01:44:19.739 align:start position:0%
department has
 
01:44:19.739 --> 01:44:20.390 align:start position:0%
department has
um

01:44:20.390 --> 01:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:23.629 --> 01:44:23.639 align:start position:0%
received from the providers the actual
 
01:44:26.510 --> 01:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
cost of care over the last
 
01:44:28.129 --> 01:44:28.139 align:start position:0%
couple of years
 
01:44:32.149 --> 01:44:32.159 align:start position:0%
the cost of care is actually much higher
 
01:44:35.109 --> 01:44:35.119 align:start position:0%
than what the contracts had provided for
 
01:44:39.109 --> 01:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
these are providers who are caring for
 
01:44:41.510 --> 01:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
our children there's I think four to
 
01:44:45.070 --> 01:44:45.080 align:start position:0%
five hundred of them in group homes
 
01:44:47.350 --> 01:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
residential facilities
 
01:44:50.810 --> 01:44:50.820 align:start position:0%
without these These are the kinds of
 
01:44:53.629 --> 01:44:53.639 align:start position:0%
programs that without the right funding
 
01:44:56.930 --> 01:44:56.940 align:start position:0%
are really in Jeopardy of of closing and
 
01:44:58.310 --> 01:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
I think
 
01:45:00.770 --> 01:45:00.780 align:start position:0%
in past histories I can remember hearing
 
01:45:03.169 --> 01:45:03.179 align:start position:0%
about group homes that close and usually
 
01:45:07.010 --> 01:45:07.020 align:start position:0%
it is financial issues that um that end
 
01:45:09.050 --> 01:45:09.060 align:start position:0%
up closing them so
 
01:45:11.750 --> 01:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
I think this this line in this
 
01:45:14.750 --> 01:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
particular in this particular document
 
01:45:16.129 --> 01:45:16.139 align:start position:0%
is really
 
01:45:16.139 --> 01:45:16.910 align:start position:0%
is really
um

01:45:16.910 --> 01:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:20.030 --> 01:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
probably very low in order to accomplish
 
01:45:22.850 --> 01:45:22.860 align:start position:0%
what we need to accomplish remember this
 
01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
is the line
 
01:45:26.810 --> 01:45:26.820 align:start position:0%
when we had this the sununu debate last
 
01:45:29.930 --> 01:45:29.940 align:start position:0%
week this is really where
 
01:45:32.510 --> 01:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
where we need
 
01:45:35.510 --> 01:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
places residential care for children who
 
01:45:37.430 --> 01:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
don't need the level of care that
 
01:45:40.189 --> 01:45:40.199 align:start position:0%
provided at sununu these are children
 
01:45:43.250 --> 01:45:43.260 align:start position:0%
who need a lower lower level of care in
 
01:45:46.070 --> 01:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
their own communities so I am concerned
 
01:45:47.810 --> 01:45:47.820 align:start position:0%
about this line
 
01:45:51.590 --> 01:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
did you say the number was 500
 
01:45:53.689 --> 01:45:53.699 align:start position:0%
I think the I think the department said
 
01:45:57.470 --> 01:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
it was 500 four to five hundred
 
01:45:59.689 --> 01:45:59.699 align:start position:0%
there's twenty seven thousand going into
 
01:46:03.609 --> 01:46:03.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:06.649 --> 01:46:06.659 align:start position:0%
I would just point out that we've been
 
01:46:08.689 --> 01:46:08.699 align:start position:0%
building out the system of care for a
 
01:46:10.790 --> 01:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
while and this is substantially more
 
01:46:13.189 --> 01:46:13.199 align:start position:0%
than what's in the current budget so it
 
01:46:15.850 --> 01:46:15.860 align:start position:0%
isn't as though we're not
 
01:46:20.030 --> 01:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
with this line funding a dramatic and
 
01:46:24.229 --> 01:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
significant increase it's just not the
 
01:46:26.270 --> 01:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
tens of millions a year that were
 
01:46:26.280 --> 01:46:27.530 align:start position:0%
tens of millions a year that were
requested

01:46:27.530 --> 01:46:27.540 align:start position:0%
requested
 
01:46:30.890 --> 01:46:30.900 align:start position:0%
it's it's only seven and a half million
 
01:46:32.810 --> 01:46:32.820 align:start position:0%
a year you know
 
01:46:36.350 --> 01:46:36.360 align:start position:0%
so so it's a lot of money and there's a
 
01:46:38.330 --> 01:46:38.340 align:start position:0%
question at how fast the whole system
 
01:46:44.750 --> 01:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:46.729 --> 01:46:46.739 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
01:46:49.430 --> 01:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
Stringham yeah I'd just like to add a
 
01:46:51.770 --> 01:46:51.780 align:start position:0%
little bit of shading on that basically
 
01:46:54.649 --> 01:46:54.659 align:start position:0%
without the the full uh Department
 
01:46:58.609 --> 01:46:58.619 align:start position:0%
request because of the um
 
01:47:01.669 --> 01:47:01.679 align:start position:0%
uh process of understanding what the
 
01:47:04.010 --> 01:47:04.020 align:start position:0%
costs are uh the way that they'll have
 
01:47:05.990 --> 01:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
to manage this is just to have fewer
 
01:47:09.290 --> 01:47:09.300 align:start position:0%
residential beds than we have now uh
 
01:47:13.310 --> 01:47:13.320 align:start position:0%
because the uh uh as
 
01:47:16.490 --> 01:47:16.500 align:start position:0%
uh representative walner said that
 
01:47:18.770 --> 01:47:18.780 align:start position:0%
um uh originally they were paying a
 
01:47:20.470 --> 01:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
certain amount which in good faith
 
01:47:22.790 --> 01:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
between the department and the
 
01:47:24.649 --> 01:47:24.659 align:start position:0%
residential housings that were paying
 
01:47:26.810 --> 01:47:26.820 align:start position:0%
what they thought was cost but now that
 
01:47:28.729 --> 01:47:28.739 align:start position:0%
they've had experience it's a relatively
 
01:47:31.550 --> 01:47:31.560 align:start position:0%
new program they understand the costs
 
01:47:33.830 --> 01:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
are higher so
 
01:47:35.810 --> 01:47:35.820 align:start position:0%
um you know we have we have a choice of
 
01:47:38.990 --> 01:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
of uh of following the contract and
 
01:47:40.970 --> 01:47:40.980 align:start position:0%
paying for fewer Beds which the
 
01:47:44.810 --> 01:47:44.820 align:start position:0%
department can do or or digging deeper
 
01:47:46.669 --> 01:47:46.679 align:start position:0%
in the legislature to keep keep the
 
01:47:51.070 --> 01:47:51.080 align:start position:0%
level of beds where they are now so
 
01:47:51.080 --> 01:47:53.410 align:start position:0%
level of beds where they are now so
and

01:47:53.410 --> 01:47:53.420 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:56.149 --> 01:47:56.159 align:start position:0%
the line item in here is a kind of a
 
01:48:01.310 --> 01:48:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:02.750 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:48:02.750 --> 01:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:48:04.669 --> 01:48:04.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair this question is for
 
01:48:06.950 --> 01:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple right lines 29 and 30
 
01:48:09.649 --> 01:48:09.659 align:start position:0%
reference the same account codes
 
01:48:11.450 --> 01:48:11.460 align:start position:0%
right with two different amounts what
 
01:48:15.470 --> 01:48:15.480 align:start position:0%
happens if we adopt 29 but not 30 if we
 
01:48:19.129 --> 01:48:19.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:21.290 --> 01:48:21.300 align:start position:0%
line 30 is the federal matching funds
 
01:48:22.550 --> 01:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
that accompany the general fund
 
01:48:25.250 --> 01:48:25.260 align:start position:0%
appropriation on line 29. thank you for
 
01:48:28.070 --> 01:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:33.290 --> 01:48:33.300 align:start position:0%
so Mr chair I I I propose that we just
 
01:48:35.390 --> 01:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
park this for a little while get through
 
01:48:38.330 --> 01:48:38.340 align:start position:0%
the rest of HP one and then and then
 
01:48:40.910 --> 01:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
come back and decide whether you could
 
01:48:42.229 --> 01:48:42.239 align:start position:0%
decide whether or not you want to vote
 
01:48:43.790 --> 01:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
it separately
 
01:48:46.330 --> 01:48:46.340 align:start position:0%
it's up to you if I I I
 
01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
you know the issue is I want to fund all
 
01:48:51.290 --> 01:48:51.300 align:start position:0%
this I just don't we just don't have the
 
01:48:54.109 --> 01:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
money to fund everything so so we funded
 
01:48:56.330 --> 01:48:56.340 align:start position:0%
this at 60 percent let's let's get
 
01:48:58.669 --> 01:48:58.679 align:start position:0%
through the rest of hb1 and then folks
 
01:49:01.070 --> 01:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
can see where else we're prioritizing
 
01:49:03.229 --> 01:49:03.239 align:start position:0%
and spending money and maybe in a little
 
01:49:05.330 --> 01:49:05.340 align:start position:0%
broader context we'd be ready to make
 
01:49:07.010 --> 01:49:07.020 align:start position:0%
that vote you have the experience of how
 
01:49:08.689 --> 01:49:08.699 align:start position:0%
much was spent in the previous biennium
 
01:49:11.209 --> 01:49:11.219 align:start position:0%
each year Mr Ripple has that but I did
 
01:49:16.550 --> 01:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
confirm that this is this is a new money
 
01:49:18.290 --> 01:49:18.300 align:start position:0%
relative to
 
01:49:21.050 --> 01:49:21.060 align:start position:0%
the current year is that I don't want to
 
01:49:23.629 --> 01:49:23.639 align:start position:0%
misstate you you at least said it's a
 
01:49:25.490 --> 01:49:25.500 align:start position:0%
lot more money than last the current
 
01:49:28.669 --> 01:49:28.679 align:start position:0%
year so in terms of General funds only
 
01:49:31.390 --> 01:49:31.400 align:start position:0%
the fiscal 23 adjusted authorized is
 
01:49:34.370 --> 01:49:34.380 align:start position:0%
18.7 million
 
01:49:36.410 --> 01:49:36.420 align:start position:0%
for fiscal 24 the number in the
 
01:49:38.629 --> 01:49:38.639 align:start position:0%
governor's budget plus the 7.4 million
 
01:49:41.990 --> 01:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
here would total 25.6
 
01:49:44.090 --> 01:49:44.100 align:start position:0%
so it would be a difference of 18.7 and
 
01:49:48.410 --> 01:49:48.420 align:start position:0%
23 and 25.6 and 24.
 
01:49:50.810 --> 01:49:50.820 align:start position:0%
so if there's as few as 500 it was still
 
01:49:57.109 --> 01:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:58.850 --> 01:49:58.860 align:start position:0%
you don't have the caseload figures in
 
01:50:02.750 --> 01:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:04.550 --> 01:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
should I continue we could come back
 
01:50:06.350 --> 01:50:06.360 align:start position:0%
with a slime item all right we'll come
 
01:50:10.490 --> 01:50:10.500 align:start position:0%
back all right so on page three uh these
 
01:50:10.500 --> 01:50:12.109 align:start position:0%
back all right so on page three uh these
items

01:50:12.109 --> 01:50:12.119 align:start position:0%
items
 
01:50:12.119 --> 01:50:12.770 align:start position:0%
items
um

01:50:12.770 --> 01:50:12.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:16.790 --> 01:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
are Are all uh all in one amendment that
 
01:50:19.390 --> 01:50:19.400 align:start position:0%
we approved yesterday two zero two three
 
01:50:23.570 --> 01:50:23.580 align:start position:0%
dash one zero six four Hotel
 
01:50:26.689 --> 01:50:26.699 align:start position:0%
um uh what we did was we carried forward
 
01:50:30.649 --> 01:50:30.659 align:start position:0%
FY 23 money as restricted revenue and
 
01:50:32.629 --> 01:50:32.639 align:start position:0%
and with that the effect of that was
 
01:50:36.250 --> 01:50:36.260 align:start position:0%
that freed up some FY 24 General funds
 
01:50:40.070 --> 01:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
we we also I wrote the note here plus
 
01:50:43.550 --> 01:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
this is a fiscal backstop oh plus we
 
01:50:46.669 --> 01:50:46.679 align:start position:0%
included in the amendment that if this
 
01:50:48.470 --> 01:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
is not enough money for these Services
 
01:50:51.229 --> 01:50:51.239 align:start position:0%
the developmental disabilities the
 
01:50:54.709 --> 01:50:54.719 align:start position:0%
acquired brain disorder the children IHS
 
01:50:57.050 --> 01:50:57.060 align:start position:0%
waiver that they can go to fiscal and
 
01:51:00.050 --> 01:51:00.060 align:start position:0%
ask for additional money so
 
01:51:02.510 --> 01:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
um so that's what this is
 
01:51:05.870 --> 01:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
the next line item 41
 
01:51:09.290 --> 01:51:09.300 align:start position:0%
on page four is the New Hampshire
 
01:51:09.300 --> 01:51:10.669 align:start position:0%
on page four is the New Hampshire
hospital

01:51:10.669 --> 01:51:10.679 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
01:51:12.790 --> 01:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
saying they they
 
01:51:16.550 --> 01:51:16.560 align:start position:0%
their consumption of personal protective
 
01:51:19.850 --> 01:51:19.860 align:start position:0%
equipment PPE has been at such a high
 
01:51:23.570 --> 01:51:23.580 align:start position:0%
rate and the and they project that their
 
01:51:26.090 --> 01:51:26.100 align:start position:0%
consumption is now at a a new normal
 
01:51:29.330 --> 01:51:29.340 align:start position:0%
they're using it in in more scenarios
 
01:51:32.270 --> 01:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
than they have in the past and also the
 
01:51:35.750 --> 01:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
price has gone up so between pricing and
 
01:51:38.570 --> 01:51:38.580 align:start position:0%
quantity they said they needed an extra
 
01:51:40.370 --> 01:51:40.380 align:start position:0%
hundred and fifty thousand dollars a
 
01:51:42.890 --> 01:51:42.900 align:start position:0%
year uh above what was in the governor's
 
01:51:45.709 --> 01:51:45.719 align:start position:0%
budget and so there it is
 
01:51:45.719 --> 01:51:46.490 align:start position:0%
budget and so there it is
um

01:51:46.490 --> 01:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:52.870 --> 01:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
line item 44 was an hb2 item that we
 
01:51:56.629 --> 01:51:56.639 align:start position:0%
did yesterday and essentially what this
 
01:51:59.689 --> 01:51:59.699 align:start position:0%
does is it complies with the jail car
 
01:52:02.570 --> 01:52:02.580 align:start position:0%
observation that the statute probably
 
01:52:05.750 --> 01:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
includes unconstitutional taxes where
 
01:52:08.450 --> 01:52:08.460 align:start position:0%
they were looking to have fees and it
 
01:52:11.090 --> 01:52:11.100 align:start position:0%
also put so we use General funds instead
 
01:52:14.570 --> 01:52:14.580 align:start position:0%
of uh the uh the taxes that were to be
 
01:52:18.709 --> 01:52:18.719 align:start position:0%
levied and then we also put a dollar in
 
01:52:22.970 --> 01:52:22.980 align:start position:0%
for fy24 donations to to get that
 
01:52:25.370 --> 01:52:25.380 align:start position:0%
account established and seated there
 
01:52:27.169 --> 01:52:27.179 align:start position:0%
have been a number of organizations
 
01:52:29.629 --> 01:52:29.639 align:start position:0%
who've said that they support this
 
01:52:31.850 --> 01:52:31.860 align:start position:0%
program so much we thought we ought to
 
01:52:33.950 --> 01:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
give them an opportunity to donate to it
 
01:52:39.229 --> 01:52:39.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:41.990 --> 01:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
um the net on that what we're really
 
01:52:44.149 --> 01:52:44.159 align:start position:0%
going to provide them is a quarter
 
01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year for a total of
 
01:52:48.530 --> 01:52:48.540 align:start position:0%
five hundred thousand
 
01:52:51.530 --> 01:52:51.540 align:start position:0%
so line item 46
 
01:52:51.540 --> 01:52:52.490 align:start position:0%
so line item 46
um

01:52:52.490 --> 01:52:52.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:54.229 --> 01:52:54.239 align:start position:0%
the department of administrative
 
01:52:57.470 --> 01:52:57.480 align:start position:0%
Services historically provided
 
01:53:00.290 --> 01:53:00.300 align:start position:0%
um shared services uh in a number of
 
01:53:02.510 --> 01:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
areas to include you know some basic
 
01:53:06.709 --> 01:53:06.719 align:start position:0%
maintenance and over the course of the
 
01:53:11.629 --> 01:53:11.639 align:start position:0%
last term Das and DHHS have come to an
 
01:53:14.750 --> 01:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
agreement that DHHS needs to be more
 
01:53:17.149 --> 01:53:17.159 align:start position:0%
self-supporting and so to do that
 
01:53:19.370 --> 01:53:19.380 align:start position:0%
they're adding three additional
 
01:53:21.649 --> 01:53:21.659 align:start position:0%
positions one administrator and two
 
01:53:24.129 --> 01:53:24.139 align:start position:0%
maintenance mechanics to do that
 
01:53:27.050 --> 01:53:27.060 align:start position:0%
what I could never really get my hands
 
01:53:30.709 --> 01:53:30.719 align:start position:0%
on was whether or not Das was reducing
 
01:53:34.609 --> 01:53:34.619 align:start position:0%
by three their head count uh I I suspect
 
01:53:36.530 --> 01:53:36.540 align:start position:0%
they probably aren't I think this is
 
01:53:39.109 --> 01:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
probably three new people but I that's
 
01:53:42.229 --> 01:53:42.239 align:start position:0%
just me and my cynicism speaking
 
01:53:44.109 --> 01:53:44.119 align:start position:0%
um line
 
01:53:48.830 --> 01:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
48 the Hampstead Hospital everyone I
 
01:53:50.930 --> 01:53:50.940 align:start position:0%
think in the room knows the Hampstead
 
01:53:53.570 --> 01:53:53.580 align:start position:0%
Hospital is a relatively a new Venture
 
01:53:56.470 --> 01:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
for us this is the first full
 
01:54:00.169 --> 01:54:00.179 align:start position:0%
budget cycle that they that we've the
 
01:54:01.970 --> 01:54:01.980 align:start position:0%
state has owned them and operated them
 
01:54:01.980 --> 01:54:03.649 align:start position:0%
state has owned them and operated them
and

01:54:03.649 --> 01:54:03.659 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:54:06.770 --> 01:54:06.780 align:start position:0%
um and the uh it was said when we
 
01:54:09.290 --> 01:54:09.300 align:start position:0%
acquired them that their business plan
 
01:54:12.410 --> 01:54:12.420 align:start position:0%
was sufficient for them to be a viable
 
01:54:14.530 --> 01:54:14.540 align:start position:0%
ongoing concern
 
01:54:18.290 --> 01:54:18.300 align:start position:0%
with the state taking over and the state
 
01:54:21.770 --> 01:54:21.780 align:start position:0%
having additional reasons to admit and
 
01:54:26.149 --> 01:54:26.159 align:start position:0%
treat people it it it it's clinical
 
01:54:28.970 --> 01:54:28.980 align:start position:0%
activity that's outside of hampstead's
 
01:54:28.980 --> 01:54:30.830 align:start position:0%
activity that's outside of hampstead's
historical

01:54:30.830 --> 01:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
historical
 
01:54:34.910 --> 01:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
conduct and so this request a 4.4
 
01:54:37.790 --> 01:54:37.800 align:start position:0%
million over the biennium is really
 
01:54:40.609 --> 01:54:40.619 align:start position:0%
there is a in a way as a form of
 
01:54:42.109 --> 01:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
business insurance we don't have
 
01:54:45.169 --> 01:54:45.179 align:start position:0%
experience with this model and in case
 
01:54:47.510 --> 01:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
that they they're spending is at a
 
01:54:50.629 --> 01:54:50.639 align:start position:0%
higher rate than the budget people think
 
01:54:53.330 --> 01:54:53.340 align:start position:0%
it'll be this is this is a shock
 
01:54:56.030 --> 01:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
absorber in the system so that that's
 
01:54:57.950 --> 01:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
that's what we did we just agreed with
 
01:55:01.189 --> 01:55:01.199 align:start position:0%
their 4.4 million and we also agreed in
 
01:55:04.609 --> 01:55:04.619 align:start position:0%
that amendment to convert 21 temporary
 
01:55:06.770 --> 01:55:06.780 align:start position:0%
positions to
 
01:55:10.669 --> 01:55:10.679 align:start position:0%
21 permanent positions keeping them full
 
01:55:10.679 --> 01:55:11.510 align:start position:0%
21 permanent positions keeping them full
time

01:55:11.510 --> 01:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:55:14.330 --> 01:55:14.340 align:start position:0%
so that's what that Amendment did
 
01:55:21.649 --> 01:55:21.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:27.590 --> 01:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
item 1031 I I I I think the
 
01:55:31.669 --> 01:55:31.679 align:start position:0%
the committee could vote on the package
 
01:55:34.189 --> 01:55:34.199 align:start position:0%
and and we could maybe have a separate
 
01:55:39.290 --> 01:55:39.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:42.470 --> 01:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
excuse me I said 1031 I'm that's that's
 
01:55:45.649 --> 01:55:45.659 align:start position:0%
a recommendation page I mean items 29
 
01:55:50.930 --> 01:55:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:53.570 --> 01:55:53.580 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chair I'd like to know if we
 
01:55:58.790 --> 01:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:01.129 --> 01:56:01.139 align:start position:0%
for a five minute break please keep it
 
01:56:03.410 --> 01:56:03.420 align:start position:0%
to that we'll have a five minute break
 
01:56:05.930 --> 01:56:05.940 align:start position:0%
all right thank you I I skipped over the
 
01:56:07.910 --> 01:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
veterans some we'll say that real quick
 
01:56:10.189 --> 01:56:10.199 align:start position:0%
that we didn't have a change for the
 
01:56:14.390 --> 01:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:16.390 --> 01:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
you want to use
 
01:56:18.890 --> 01:56:18.900 align:start position:0%
or run recess
 
01:56:21.830 --> 01:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
you want to use the division two room
 
01:56:24.709 --> 01:56:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:24.719 --> 01:56:27.770 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:56:27.770 --> 01:56:27.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:27.780 --> 02:10:03.490 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:10:03.490 --> 02:10:03.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:45.430 --> 02:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:48.229 --> 02:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
I oh I am I didn't realize you were
 
02:10:51.350 --> 02:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
waiting for me I'm um okay so
 
02:10:51.360 --> 02:10:52.070 align:start position:0%
waiting for me I'm um okay so

um
 
02:10:55.490 --> 02:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
Mr chair what I would like to do is I
 
02:10:59.050 --> 02:10:59.060 align:start position:0%
would like to make a motion to accept
 
02:11:03.530 --> 02:11:03.540 align:start position:0%
the detailed change from hb1 with the
 
02:11:06.290 --> 02:11:06.300 align:start position:0%
exception of line 19 on page one that
 
02:11:08.390 --> 02:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
we've already voted on so I I wouldn't
 
02:11:11.750 --> 02:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
want it brought back up in this vote and
 
02:11:14.510 --> 02:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
then with the exception of lines 29 and
 
02:11:17.149 --> 02:11:17.159 align:start position:0%
30 relative to the funding of the system
 
02:11:18.470 --> 02:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
of care
 
02:11:21.530 --> 02:11:21.540 align:start position:0%
uh and so I'd like to vote on the rest
 
02:11:24.050 --> 02:11:24.060 align:start position:0%
of the package
 
02:11:24.060 --> 02:11:26.570 align:start position:0%
of the package
um

02:11:26.570 --> 02:11:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:30.350 --> 02:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
that's so that's my motion second
 
02:11:33.649 --> 02:11:33.659 align:start position:0%
question in a second to vote for the
 
02:11:36.169 --> 02:11:36.179 align:start position:0%
remaining parts of hb1 recommendation
 
02:11:38.810 --> 02:11:38.820 align:start position:0%
from division three sure everyone
 
02:11:42.830 --> 02:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:47.510 --> 02:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
sorry to explain something to the clerk
 
02:11:47.520 --> 02:11:51.109 align:start position:0%
sorry to explain something to the clerk
919

02:11:51.109 --> 02:11:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:53.570 --> 02:11:53.580 align:start position:0%
lines 29.
 
02:11:53.580 --> 02:11:55.189 align:start position:0%
lines 29.
30.

02:11:55.189 --> 02:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
30.
 
02:11:55.199 --> 02:11:58.490 align:start position:0%
30.
yep

02:11:58.490 --> 02:11:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:03.589 --> 02:12:03.599 align:start position:0%
okay so accept detail yep except
 
02:12:05.870 --> 02:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
discussion representative walner yes
 
02:12:10.189 --> 02:12:10.199 align:start position:0%
thank you I am gonna I'm gonna vote no I
 
02:12:12.290 --> 02:12:12.300 align:start position:0%
um I feel that we did actually House
 
02:12:15.649 --> 02:12:15.659 align:start position:0%
Bill one I do feel that division three
 
02:12:15.659 --> 02:12:16.729 align:start position:0%
Bill one I do feel that division three
um

02:12:16.729 --> 02:12:16.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:16.739 --> 02:12:18.229 align:start position:0%
um
did

02:12:18.229 --> 02:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
did
 
02:12:21.050 --> 02:12:21.060 align:start position:0%
do a good job on
 
02:12:21.060 --> 02:12:22.070 align:start position:0%
do a good job on
um

02:12:22.070 --> 02:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:25.070 --> 02:12:25.080 align:start position:0%
the house bill one
 
02:12:27.709 --> 02:12:27.719 align:start position:0%
allocations but I'm really concerned
 
02:12:30.410 --> 02:12:30.420 align:start position:0%
right now about having the system of
 
02:12:33.050 --> 02:12:33.060 align:start position:0%
care being voted for separately because
 
02:12:34.910 --> 02:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know what the outcome is going
 
02:12:37.910 --> 02:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
to be of that so I'm going to vote no at
 
02:12:39.530 --> 02:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
this point on the package but it's not
 
02:12:41.930 --> 02:12:41.940 align:start position:0%
because I don't think that we didn't we
 
02:12:43.790 --> 02:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
did a lot of we did do a lot of good
 
02:12:45.410 --> 02:12:45.420 align:start position:0%
things in there
 
02:12:47.930 --> 02:12:47.940 align:start position:0%
um but I think the system of care is
 
02:12:50.510 --> 02:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
really important and I don't not knowing
 
02:12:52.010 --> 02:12:52.020 align:start position:0%
where what the outcome will be I I'm
 
02:12:55.490 --> 02:12:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:59.089 --> 02:12:59.099 align:start position:0%
so we're not voting on system of care at
 
02:13:00.770 --> 02:13:00.780 align:start position:0%
this time if you want to have that vote
 
02:13:03.050 --> 02:13:03.060 align:start position:0%
first we could ask representative
 
02:13:05.089 --> 02:13:05.099 align:start position:0%
Edwards if you'd make that motion she
 
02:13:08.089 --> 02:13:08.099 align:start position:0%
had made the request during the break
 
02:13:10.129 --> 02:13:10.139 align:start position:0%
and Mr chair because you and I had
 
02:13:12.530 --> 02:13:12.540 align:start position:0%
agreed to do it the other way I didn't
 
02:13:16.490 --> 02:13:16.500 align:start position:0%
want to cause turmoil for you I I other
 
02:13:19.850 --> 02:13:19.860 align:start position:0%
than that I the order is going to get us
 
02:13:21.589 --> 02:13:21.599 align:start position:0%
the same place I don't think it's going
 
02:13:24.950 --> 02:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
to change the system of care vote you
 
02:13:27.229 --> 02:13:27.239 align:start position:0%
know and it was more logical to just get
 
02:13:28.729 --> 02:13:28.739 align:start position:0%
everything we could out of the way
 
02:13:30.830 --> 02:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
before we came back to System of care
 
02:13:34.069 --> 02:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
but I I really have You'll wish if you
 
02:13:36.229 --> 02:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
want to continue with your motion we
 
02:13:38.569 --> 02:13:38.579 align:start position:0%
will do so today is another day of
 
02:13:40.729 --> 02:13:40.739 align:start position:0%
professional courtesy and if that's what
 
02:13:42.709 --> 02:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
representative Wallner would like to do
 
02:13:45.430 --> 02:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
is to vote on system of care first lines
 
02:13:50.030 --> 02:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
uh 22 through 23 with your with your
 
02:13:52.490 --> 02:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
flexibility I I'm willing to do that
 
02:13:57.169 --> 02:13:57.179 align:start position:0%
lines 29 and 30. 29 and 30 on page two
 
02:14:00.050 --> 02:14:00.060 align:start position:0%
yeah so so I'll withdraw the previous
 
02:14:04.850 --> 02:14:04.860 align:start position:0%
motion and uh instead move that we move
 
02:14:10.069 --> 02:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
uh to vote Yes to fund lines 29 and 30.
 
02:14:13.310 --> 02:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
the the key issue is uh the general
 
02:14:15.770 --> 02:14:15.780 align:start position:0%
funds because the federal funds flow
 
02:14:18.790 --> 02:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
from that uh at
 
02:14:23.510 --> 02:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
14.854 million dollars as shown
 
02:14:26.510 --> 02:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
so any any further discussion or
 
02:14:29.209 --> 02:14:29.219 align:start position:0%
questions on the motion to vote on lines
 
02:14:32.089 --> 02:14:32.099 align:start position:0%
29 and 30 system of care you need a
 
02:14:34.729 --> 02:14:34.739 align:start position:0%
second motion is second by represent
 
02:14:42.229 --> 02:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:42.239 --> 02:14:43.430 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:14:43.430 --> 02:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:14:43.440 --> 02:14:44.930 align:start position:0%
yes
yes

02:14:44.930 --> 02:14:44.940 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:14:48.370 --> 02:14:48.380 align:start position:0%
someone had a you have a question
 
02:14:51.410 --> 02:14:51.420 align:start position:0%
I continue to think that that line is
 
02:14:53.930 --> 02:14:53.940 align:start position:0%
underfunded and that we're going to
 
02:14:56.270 --> 02:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to end up having problems
 
02:14:59.089 --> 02:14:59.099 align:start position:0%
during this biennium without those rate
 
02:15:01.370 --> 02:15:01.380 align:start position:0%
increases there for the Department to
 
02:15:03.770 --> 02:15:03.780 align:start position:0%
negotiate contracts with these
 
02:15:06.410 --> 02:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
residential providers I remind you these
 
02:15:08.510 --> 02:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
are 24-hour providers it's very
 
02:15:10.910 --> 02:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
expensive they're having a very hard
 
02:15:14.030 --> 02:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
time finding Workforce this is this is
 
02:15:17.450 --> 02:15:17.460 align:start position:0%
the exactly kind of service we want for
 
02:15:17.460 --> 02:15:18.530 align:start position:0%
the exactly kind of service we want for
children

02:15:18.530 --> 02:15:18.540 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:15:22.250 --> 02:15:22.260 align:start position:0%
it isn't incarceration it's in the
 
02:15:24.649 --> 02:15:24.659 align:start position:0%
community it keeps the kids in the
 
02:15:27.109 --> 02:15:27.119 align:start position:0%
community they um
 
02:15:30.470 --> 02:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
can often continue in their own schools
 
02:15:32.450 --> 02:15:32.460 align:start position:0%
this is the place where we should be
 
02:15:36.350 --> 02:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
putting our money and um
 
02:15:39.890 --> 02:15:39.900 align:start position:0%
I'm just sorry that we are not that we
 
02:15:42.410 --> 02:15:42.420 align:start position:0%
at this point are not increasing this
 
02:15:42.420 --> 02:15:44.030 align:start position:0%
at this point are not increasing this
line

02:15:44.030 --> 02:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
line
 
02:15:49.069 --> 02:15:49.079 align:start position:0%
if if I may uh we we I I believe the
 
02:15:52.490 --> 02:15:52.500 align:start position:0%
vote in division three uh on this
 
02:15:56.050 --> 02:15:56.060 align:start position:0%
particular issue was probably 5-4
 
02:15:59.149 --> 02:15:59.159 align:start position:0%
and if if the world was filled with
 
02:16:01.669 --> 02:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
infinite amounts of money I think we
 
02:16:04.729 --> 02:16:04.739 align:start position:0%
could have uh spent the 25 million or so
 
02:16:07.370 --> 02:16:07.380 align:start position:0%
extra over the current year that had
 
02:16:10.850 --> 02:16:10.860 align:start position:0%
been requested by a prioritized need but
 
02:16:13.370 --> 02:16:13.380 align:start position:0%
as it turned out because we had to find
 
02:16:17.290 --> 02:16:17.300 align:start position:0%
money to put into the Medicaid rate
 
02:16:19.490 --> 02:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate increase we had to
 
02:16:22.430 --> 02:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
find money because our strategic problem
 
02:16:25.790 --> 02:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
isn't back in that ER boarding area uh
 
02:16:28.970 --> 02:16:28.980 align:start position:0%
that this is why we we shave this while
 
02:16:32.330 --> 02:16:32.340 align:start position:0%
still funding the majority of it
 
02:16:34.429 --> 02:16:34.439 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren followed by
 
02:16:36.889 --> 02:16:36.899 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham thank you Mr
 
02:16:36.899 --> 02:16:38.030 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham thank you Mr
chair

02:16:38.030 --> 02:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:16:40.730 --> 02:16:40.740 align:start position:0%
um I I guess I would refer us to the
 
02:16:43.730 --> 02:16:43.740 align:start position:0%
paragraph on page two of our spreadsheet
 
02:16:46.669 --> 02:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
that says that
 
02:16:50.389 --> 02:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
we're we're trying to address provider
 
02:16:53.209 --> 02:16:53.219 align:start position:0%
capacity that's insufficient to meet the
 
02:16:55.250 --> 02:16:55.260 align:start position:0%
current demand but we're only funding it
 
02:17:01.129 --> 02:17:01.139 align:start position:0%
60 percent so we're also missing out on
 
02:17:03.950 --> 02:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
Federal match
 
02:17:07.129 --> 02:17:07.139 align:start position:0%
um so I guess I'm concerned that we
 
02:17:09.110 --> 02:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
really needed to make this a priority
 
02:17:10.610 --> 02:17:10.620 align:start position:0%
and now
 
02:17:14.450 --> 02:17:14.460 align:start position:0%
we're shortchanging it thank you
 
02:17:16.070 --> 02:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
represent a string and followed by
 
02:17:17.810 --> 02:17:17.820 align:start position:0%
represent and not you okay represent
 
02:17:17.820 --> 02:17:18.889 align:start position:0%
represent and not you okay represent
home

02:17:18.889 --> 02:17:18.899 align:start position:0%
home
 
02:17:21.349 --> 02:17:21.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:17:23.929 --> 02:17:23.939 align:start position:0%
we only have so much funds I would like
 
02:17:25.969 --> 02:17:25.979 align:start position:0%
to note that the current budget is going
 
02:17:25.979 --> 02:17:26.870 align:start position:0%
to note that the current budget is going
up

02:17:26.870 --> 02:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
up
 
02:17:29.629 --> 02:17:29.639 align:start position:0%
between hb1 and hb2
 
02:17:32.030 --> 02:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
just shy of a billion dollars in new
 
02:17:34.129 --> 02:17:34.139 align:start position:0%
spending between last biennium and this
 
02:17:36.049 --> 02:17:36.059 align:start position:0%
biennium we have done an enormous amount
 
02:17:38.330 --> 02:17:38.340 align:start position:0%
of increases in spending for various
 
02:17:41.030 --> 02:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
activities but we can't do everything
 
02:17:43.730 --> 02:17:43.740 align:start position:0%
I think the 60 number was a reasonable
 
02:17:43.740 --> 02:17:49.070 align:start position:0%
I think the 60 number was a reasonable
number

02:17:49.070 --> 02:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:50.629 --> 02:17:50.639 align:start position:0%
representative hack and Phillips
 
02:17:52.669 --> 02:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
followed by representative
 
02:17:55.009 --> 02:17:55.019 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:17:55.019 --> 02:17:56.450 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

02:17:56.450 --> 02:17:56.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:58.730 --> 02:17:58.740 align:start position:0%
I just want to um
 
02:18:00.950 --> 02:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
draw the committee's attention to the
 
02:18:02.810 --> 02:18:02.820 align:start position:0%
fact that you know the consequence of
 
02:18:05.570 --> 02:18:05.580 align:start position:0%
not filling this request
 
02:18:08.929 --> 02:18:08.939 align:start position:0%
to the full ask is that
 
02:18:11.570 --> 02:18:11.580 align:start position:0%
you know there will be spillover into
 
02:18:13.790 --> 02:18:13.800 align:start position:0%
the tertiary health health care System
 
02:18:17.150 --> 02:18:17.160 align:start position:0%
across the state so you know having an
 
02:18:19.849 --> 02:18:19.859 align:start position:0%
intimate knowledge of many of the folks
 
02:18:22.849 --> 02:18:22.859 align:start position:0%
at dhmc and that supporting Network
 
02:18:25.190 --> 02:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Health across our state
 
02:18:27.410 --> 02:18:27.420 align:start position:0%
uh you know I am aware that the system
 
02:18:30.110 --> 02:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
is currently teetering uh on
 
02:18:32.389 --> 02:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
availability of beds and we are talking
 
02:18:34.790 --> 02:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
about being on the edge of a very
 
02:18:36.469 --> 02:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
serious health care crisis in our state
 
02:18:38.750 --> 02:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
and Across the Nation
 
02:18:41.030 --> 02:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
um you know I think the consequence of
 
02:18:44.570 --> 02:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
us not stepping up to the system of care
 
02:18:46.969 --> 02:18:46.979 align:start position:0%
full additional request to ask is that
 
02:18:49.190 --> 02:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
you know we are going to further push
 
02:18:52.549 --> 02:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
our tertiary system into a deeper hole
 
02:18:56.150 --> 02:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
which will cost far more to dig out than
 
02:18:58.730 --> 02:18:58.740 align:start position:0%
just supporting the system of care
 
02:19:02.570 --> 02:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
so my my urgency cannot be expressed
 
02:19:05.450 --> 02:19:05.460 align:start position:0%
appropriately for you know where we are
 
02:19:08.150 --> 02:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
as a state and a nation
 
02:19:10.490 --> 02:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
in this current crisis uh which is about
 
02:19:14.690 --> 02:19:14.700 align:start position:0%
to get worse and you know my
 
02:19:17.810 --> 02:19:17.820 align:start position:0%
my suggestion would be to pull into the
 
02:19:21.650 --> 02:19:21.660 align:start position:0%
pockets of our Surplus for year 23 and
 
02:19:24.049 --> 02:19:24.059 align:start position:0%
and to consider um you know what we can
 
02:19:26.270 --> 02:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
do with that bottom line
 
02:19:28.610 --> 02:19:28.620 align:start position:0%
to meet the system of care I think it's
 
02:19:30.889 --> 02:19:30.899 align:start position:0%
of critical importance and it will be a
 
02:19:33.410 --> 02:19:33.420 align:start position:0%
huge mistake to to move forward as if
 
02:19:35.330 --> 02:19:35.340 align:start position:0%
nothing you know as if there wasn't a
 
02:19:36.889 --> 02:19:36.899 align:start position:0%
larger consequence down the road there
 
02:19:39.230 --> 02:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
is so we should be aware of that
 
02:19:41.030 --> 02:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
I will remind the members we have a hard
 
02:19:43.009 --> 02:19:43.019 align:start position:0%
stop at noon some of us have a meeting
 
02:19:45.110 --> 02:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
we have to go to so if we don't finish
 
02:19:47.030 --> 02:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
up we'll have to come back after lunch
 
02:19:49.730 --> 02:19:49.740 align:start position:0%
all right I do have two more items after
 
02:19:51.830 --> 02:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
this we may not get through them
 
02:19:55.429 --> 02:19:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:57.530 --> 02:19:57.540 align:start position:0%
uh just to point out
 
02:19:59.810 --> 02:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
this was a prioritized needy of the
 
02:19:59.820 --> 02:20:00.889 align:start position:0%
this was a prioritized needy of the
department

02:20:00.889 --> 02:20:00.899 align:start position:0%
department
 
02:20:03.710 --> 02:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
the governor didn't fund it at all when
 
02:20:05.750 --> 02:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
they did at zero
 
02:20:08.750 --> 02:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
um we funded it at 60 and I would point
 
02:20:10.250 --> 02:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
out that this whole discussion did not
 
02:20:13.250 --> 02:20:13.260 align:start position:0%
occur during our division three meetings
 
02:20:15.290 --> 02:20:15.300 align:start position:0%
in the context of maybe we shouldn't
 
02:20:17.990 --> 02:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
increase Medicaid rates as much to allow
 
02:20:19.910 --> 02:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
for more spending here
 
02:20:22.310 --> 02:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
furthermore we're only partly through
 
02:20:24.050 --> 02:20:24.060 align:start position:0%
the process the Senate has yet to
 
02:20:26.090 --> 02:20:26.100 align:start position:0%
consider this whole process the whole
 
02:20:28.010 --> 02:20:28.020 align:start position:0%
bill the whole budget
 
02:20:29.330 --> 02:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
um so I don't think this is the LA I
 
02:20:31.010 --> 02:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
know this isn't the last shot at
 
02:20:32.450 --> 02:20:32.460 align:start position:0%
adjusting this
 
02:20:33.830 --> 02:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
um if the Senate looks at everything and
 
02:20:35.090 --> 02:20:35.100 align:start position:0%
decides they should
 
02:20:36.830 --> 02:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
change the way things are allocated
 
02:20:39.710 --> 02:20:39.720 align:start position:0%

and we're going to have to come back but
 
02:24:54.349 --> 02:24:54.359 align:start position:0%
if I could just Tee It Up for people to
 
02:24:56.030 --> 02:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
think about and discuss if they want to
 
02:24:59.690 --> 02:24:59.700 align:start position:0%
over their lunch uh we we identified
 
02:25:02.630 --> 02:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
um late last night we've tried to work
 
02:25:07.130 --> 02:25:07.140 align:start position:0%
very collaboratively on uh on this the
 
02:25:07.140 --> 02:25:08.710 align:start position:0%
very collaboratively on uh on this the
amendment

02:25:08.710 --> 02:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:25:12.309 --> 02:25:12.319 align:start position:0%
1183 which was the Medicaid
 
02:25:15.469 --> 02:25:15.479 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate hikes
 
02:25:20.090 --> 02:25:20.100 align:start position:0%
um what what we found is in an effort to
 
02:25:23.510 --> 02:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
use the the the blue template with some
 
02:25:27.170 --> 02:25:27.180 align:start position:0%
red numbers that we ended up with a
 
02:25:29.090 --> 02:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
mismatch and the amount of money
 
02:25:32.570 --> 02:25:32.580 align:start position:0%
allocated for the ambulance services and
 
02:25:34.630 --> 02:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
I know of two ways that we could address
 
02:25:37.690 --> 02:25:37.700 align:start position:0%
the what has become a technical problem
 
02:25:40.550 --> 02:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
and but I I was just it was just
 
02:25:42.170 --> 02:25:42.180 align:start position:0%
whispered to me that there could be a
 
02:25:45.230 --> 02:25:45.240 align:start position:0%
third so so I'm going to try to resolve
 
02:25:47.929 --> 02:25:47.939 align:start position:0%
that and and bring forward what I think
 
02:25:50.330 --> 02:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
a proper motion is after listening to
 
02:25:50.340 --> 02:25:53.389 align:start position:0%
a proper motion is after listening to
everyone

02:25:53.389 --> 02:25:53.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:53.399 --> 02:25:54.469 align:start position:0%

representative Edwards I'm going to
 
04:16:08.929 --> 04:16:08.939 align:start position:0%
start with good news Mr chairman uh
 
04:16:10.910 --> 04:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
there's only one more item from division
 
04:16:13.670 --> 04:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
three not two uh what we're going to
 
04:16:16.790 --> 04:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
talk about is
 
04:16:19.790 --> 04:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
on if you if you still have the packet
 
04:16:22.370 --> 04:16:22.380 align:start position:0%
from yesterday to the division three hb2
 
04:16:22.380 --> 04:16:23.510 align:start position:0%
from yesterday to the division three hb2
packet

04:16:23.510 --> 04:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
packet
 
04:16:27.889 --> 04:16:27.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:29.630 --> 04:16:29.640 align:start position:0%
and then if you were to stick your
 
04:16:33.650 --> 04:16:33.660 align:start position:0%
finger on line 14 of page 21 of the
 
04:16:36.590 --> 04:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
division three hb2 packet
 
04:16:38.689 --> 04:16:38.699 align:start position:0%
I kind of wait until it looks like
 
04:16:46.370 --> 04:16:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:51.590 --> 04:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
okay so so the issue that we ran into is
 
04:16:51.600 --> 04:16:53.410 align:start position:0%
okay so so the issue that we ran into is
that

04:16:53.410 --> 04:16:53.420 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:16:56.689 --> 04:16:56.699 align:start position:0%
the community had asked in the ambulance
 
04:17:00.550 --> 04:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
line for uh for 2.2 million dollars
 
04:17:03.590 --> 04:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
per year and
 
04:17:05.570 --> 04:17:05.580 align:start position:0%
um and that's what that's what we had
 
04:17:09.530 --> 04:17:09.540 align:start position:0%
agreed on but we also wanted to adopt
 
04:17:12.110 --> 04:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
the structure that representative
 
04:17:14.510 --> 04:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
Stringham included
 
04:17:17.330 --> 04:17:17.340 align:start position:0%
by pulling in the detail of the

from line 16 to 20. will upon further
 
04:17:25.670 --> 04:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
review and Analysis representative
 
04:17:28.550 --> 04:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
Stringer Stringham noticed that if we
 
04:17:30.830 --> 04:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
Implement these rates then we don't have
 
04:17:35.349 --> 04:17:35.359 align:start position:0%
enough money in in this line 12
 
04:17:38.990 --> 04:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
item what is that 19 used in Roman
 
04:17:43.309 --> 04:17:43.319 align:start position:0%
numerals I think that's 19. and so the
 
04:17:45.710 --> 04:17:45.720 align:start position:0%
quandary was do we put more money in or
 
04:17:49.250 --> 04:17:49.260 align:start position:0%
do we just remove the rates and while I
 
04:17:52.250 --> 04:17:52.260 align:start position:0%
was away the smarter people got together
 
04:17:55.550 --> 04:17:55.560 align:start position:0%
and figured out now let's let's leave
 
04:17:58.550 --> 04:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
them the amount of money alone on the
 
04:18:00.889 --> 04:18:00.899 align:start position:0%
possibility that that amount might might
 
04:18:03.170 --> 04:18:03.180 align:start position:0%
change but we don't know that it will
 
04:18:06.110 --> 04:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
but it might but if it doesn't what the
 
04:18:08.150 --> 04:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
what the proposal is and you should have
 
04:18:10.670 --> 04:18:10.680 align:start position:0%
it in your hand is that we would add the
 
04:18:13.490 --> 04:18:13.500 align:start position:0%
phrase at the bottom where it says if
 
04:18:15.290 --> 04:18:15.300 align:start position:0%
the department determines that the
 
04:18:17.389 --> 04:18:17.399 align:start position:0%
Appropriations contained in this sub
 
04:18:20.269 --> 04:18:20.279 align:start position:0%
paragraph are insufficient to set rates
 
04:18:23.450 --> 04:18:23.460 align:start position:0%
to specified levels it may delay the
 
04:18:26.210 --> 04:18:26.220 align:start position:0%
implementation until such time as the
 
04:18:30.290 --> 04:18:30.300 align:start position:0%
rate increases can be provided so so in
 
04:18:32.269 --> 04:18:32.279 align:start position:0%
other words
 
04:18:36.170 --> 04:18:36.180 align:start position:0%
keeping the amount of money alone that
 
04:18:38.870 --> 04:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
we we voted on yesterday
 
04:18:41.210 --> 04:18:41.220 align:start position:0%
um what this new sentence would do is
 
04:18:44.870 --> 04:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
add flexibility so that if the rate
 
04:18:47.090 --> 04:18:47.100 align:start position:0%
increase couldn't really go into effect
 
04:18:50.150 --> 04:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
until say November because that's when
 
04:18:52.070 --> 04:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
there'd be enough money then then
 
04:18:54.590 --> 04:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
November it is and then if some more
 
04:18:57.050 --> 04:18:57.060 align:start position:0%
money were added to this and it could
 
04:18:59.389 --> 04:18:59.399 align:start position:0%
become October or earlier or something
 
04:19:02.510 --> 04:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
so I I like the flexibility the
 
04:19:04.429 --> 04:19:04.439 align:start position:0%
Departments with the flexibility I think
 
04:19:07.969 --> 04:19:07.979 align:start position:0%
represents Stringham Mooney irf all
 
04:19:10.370 --> 04:19:10.380 align:start position:0%
talked about this they're all okay with
 
04:19:14.990 --> 04:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
this approach and so I would uh although
 
04:19:16.610 --> 04:19:16.620 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have an official amendment
 
04:19:20.530 --> 04:19:20.540 align:start position:0%
number I I would like to have a vote on
 
04:19:25.490 --> 04:19:25.500 align:start position:0%
adding this paragraph to what would be a
 
04:19:31.550 --> 04:19:31.560 align:start position:0%
new line 21 22 and 23 of of
 
04:19:37.870 --> 04:19:37.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:41.630 --> 04:19:41.640 align:start position:0%
all the members understand the proposal
 
04:19:44.090 --> 04:19:44.100 align:start position:0%
second the motion
 
04:19:46.309 --> 04:19:46.319 align:start position:0%
motion by representative Edwards
 
04:19:47.750 --> 04:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative money
 
04:19:49.910 --> 04:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
question by representative McGuire thank
 
04:19:53.030 --> 04:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I'm just curious why the
 
04:19:55.370 --> 04:19:55.380 align:start position:0%
first number is 13 and the others are in
 
04:19:57.650 --> 04:19:57.660 align:start position:0%
the hundreds is is one like minutes and
 
04:19:59.330 --> 04:19:59.340 align:start position:0%
the other is hours or something like
 
04:19:59.340 --> 04:20:02.450 align:start position:0%
the other is hours or something like
that

04:20:02.450 --> 04:20:02.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:05.450 --> 04:20:05.460 align:start position:0%
uh I'll go to the committee expert
 
04:20:08.689 --> 04:20:08.699 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham
 
04:20:10.910 --> 04:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
we ounce thirteen dollars it's seven
 
04:20:12.410 --> 04:20:12.420 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars it's three twenty five
 
04:20:16.070 --> 04:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
dollars is 450 so we don't have to have
 
04:20:20.570 --> 04:20:20.580 align:start position:0%
a point zero zero that's true but but uh
 
04:20:23.090 --> 04:20:23.100 align:start position:0%
um ambulance fees per mile tend to be
 
04:20:26.150 --> 04:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
dollars and cents and the other fees
 
04:20:27.889 --> 04:20:27.899 align:start position:0%
tend to be dollars and cents too but
 
04:20:29.870 --> 04:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
dollars is close enough
 
04:20:33.170 --> 04:20:33.180 align:start position:0%
so when's miles and ones per hour per
 
04:20:35.750 --> 04:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
day or something the others are incident
 
04:20:35.760 --> 04:20:36.950 align:start position:0%
day or something the others are incident
codes

04:20:36.950 --> 04:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
codes
 
04:20:40.670 --> 04:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
um so you you get miles plus you know if
 
04:20:49.729 --> 04:20:49.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:51.830 --> 04:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
any any further discussion on the
 
04:20:55.729 --> 04:20:55.739 align:start position:0%
proposal to change this page in hb2
 
04:20:58.250 --> 04:20:58.260 align:start position:0%
everybody understands where it is going
 
04:20:59.210 --> 04:20:59.220 align:start position:0%
to go
 
04:21:02.450 --> 04:21:02.460 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman representative Emrick yeah I
 
04:21:04.189 --> 04:21:04.199 align:start position:0%
think I think you misstated that this
 
04:21:06.290 --> 04:21:06.300 align:start position:0%
three additional paragraphs I think this
 
04:21:08.269 --> 04:21:08.279 align:start position:0%
looks to me like it's just a a
 
04:21:15.170 --> 04:21:15.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:16.610 --> 04:21:16.620 align:start position:0%
um with the addition of that last
 
04:21:20.990 --> 04:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
paragraph okay I I think technically
 
04:21:23.630 --> 04:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
you're correct but everything is the
 
04:21:26.210 --> 04:21:26.220 align:start position:0%
same until you get to the part where it
 
04:21:29.330 --> 04:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
says if the department determines so so
 
04:21:32.090 --> 04:21:32.100 align:start position:0%
the way it would look in your
 
04:21:37.070 --> 04:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
um in your new hb2 would be those three
 
04:21:39.650 --> 04:21:39.660 align:start position:0%
sentences would get added because none
 
04:21:43.309 --> 04:21:43.319 align:start position:0%
of the words above it in uh section 19
 
04:21:45.410 --> 04:21:45.420 align:start position:0%
change we totally I'm just saying I
 
04:21:47.570 --> 04:21:47.580 align:start position:0%
think you want to get the the motion
 
04:21:49.550 --> 04:21:49.560 align:start position:0%
correct it just becomes part of that
 
04:21:51.530 --> 04:21:51.540 align:start position:0%
paragraph it didn't add a new
 
04:21:55.630 --> 04:21:55.640 align:start position:0%
it doesn't add 20. so it pushes
 
04:21:58.870 --> 04:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
makes 19 bigger that's all right okay
 
04:22:02.570 --> 04:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
yes representative Erv just to be clear
 
04:22:03.889 --> 04:22:03.899 align:start position:0%
the first paragraph is somewhat
 
04:22:06.830 --> 04:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
different as well is it yeah yep
 
04:22:08.990 --> 04:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
representative stringham's request the
 
04:22:11.210 --> 04:22:11.220 align:start position:0%
first paragraph removes the provision
 
04:22:13.670 --> 04:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
stating that ambulance EMT Medicaid fee
 
04:22:15.349 --> 04:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
levels shall be set at Medicare fee
 
04:22:19.070 --> 04:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:20.750 --> 04:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:22:24.650 --> 04:22:24.660 align:start position:0%
so I'll say instead I motion that we
 
04:22:37.729 --> 04:22:37.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:54.889 --> 04:22:54.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:59.150 --> 04:22:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:01.189 --> 04:23:01.199 align:start position:0%
there's no further discussion the clerk
 
04:23:03.110 --> 04:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
will call a roll on accepting the
 
04:23:08.630 --> 04:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
replacement of item 19 in hp2 on page
 
04:23:08.640 --> 04:23:11.870 align:start position:0%
replacement of item 19 in hp2 on page
free

04:23:11.870 --> 04:23:11.880 align:start position:0%

the LBA members
 
04:24:49.969 --> 04:24:49.979 align:start position:0%

yeah I don't think I can find it Mr
 
04:25:03.050 --> 04:25:03.060 align:start position:0%

put all this together and you'll hear
 
04:25:07.550 --> 04:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
from Michael Kane around 10 o'clock 10
 
04:25:12.229 --> 04:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
o'clock all right so I authorize the LBA
 
04:25:14.630 --> 04:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
I hereby authorize the LBA to make any
 
04:25:16.729 --> 04:25:16.739 align:start position:0%
