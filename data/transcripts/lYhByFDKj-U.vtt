you um I really appreciate that the work
 
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
that this committee is doing and I'm
 
00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 align:start position:0%
grateful to be here today um I'm Risa
 
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
Evans I live in kukuk I moved to New
 
00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 align:start position:0%
Hampshire about 30 years ago um after I
 
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 align:start position:0%
finished law school to work at the New
 
00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 align:start position:0%
Hampshire public defender I was there
 
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
for a number of years and I also taught
 
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
at UNH School of Law here in conquered
 
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
for a number of years and I currently
 
00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 align:start position:0%
work as a staff attorney at Children's
 
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 align:start position:0%
Health defense and um in that work one
 
00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:38.439 align:start position:0%
of the things that I've been doing is
 
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 align:start position:0%
file filing Freedom of Information Act
 
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 align:start position:0%
requests with federal agencies and so
 
00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:44.439 align:start position:0%
that work is going to be the basis for
 
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 align:start position:0%
my testimony today um and specifically
 
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
what I'm going to be talking about is um
 
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 align:start position:0%
some federal agenes responses to
 
00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
requests for records of their
 
00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 align:start position:0%
postauthorization safety monitoring of
 
00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccines and by post
 
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
authorization monitoring what I mean is
 
00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:04.159 align:start position:0%
the monitoring that has occurred since
 
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 align:start position:0%
December 2020 when the FDA granted
 
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 align:start position:0%
emergency use authorizations to those
 
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.030 align:start position:0%
emergency use authorizations to those
different

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 align:start position:0%
products so first just by way of a
 
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 align:start position:0%
little bit of context and also an
 
00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 align:start position:0%
overview of what I'm going to be talking
 
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 align:start position:0%
about um in 2022 um I on behalf of CHD
 
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 align:start position:0%
submitted a handful of foyer requests to
 
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 align:start position:0%
agencies within the US Department of
 
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services seeking
 
00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 align:start position:0%
records of the the agency's post
 
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
authorization safety monitoring of the
 
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
covid shots um and so just briefly the
 
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
reason that we sought this information
 
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
the reason that we thought it was
 
00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:42.759 align:start position:0%
important for the public to have this
 
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 align:start position:0%
information is because as you probably
 
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 align:start position:0%
are aware the clinical trials for the
 
00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 align:start position:0%
shots did not provide a full safety
 
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 align:start position:0%
profile due in part to their limited
 
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 align:start position:0%
duration right they were unblinded after
 
00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 align:start position:0%
about six months there was no data about
 
00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 align:start position:0%
you know sort of later occurring side
 
00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:02.199 align:start position:0%
effects um there was also you know even
 
00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 align:start position:0%
though the sample sizes were large
 
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
compared to Childhood vaccines um they
 
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
still only had I think say in the fiser
 
00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
trial 20,000 people in the experimental
 
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 align:start position:0%
arms so not enough people to capture
 
00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:15.759 align:start position:0%
side effects that might occur say in one
 
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
in every 100,000 people which sounds
 
00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:19.639 align:start position:0%
rare until you think about the number of
 
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
people who have taken the shot so it's
 
00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759 align:start position:0%
actually you know not so rare but um and
 
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 align:start position:0%
then finally the populations who were
 
00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:28.759 align:start position:0%
included in the clinical trials um were
 
00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
limited so pregnant women were excluded
 
00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
people with um uh who were imuno
 
00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039 align:start position:0%
compromised were excluded um people
 
00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 align:start position:0%
under 18 were excluded so there were a
 
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of populations for whom we
 
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
didn't have any safety data and so for
 
00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
this reason we are all you know um
 
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 align:start position:0%
individual citizens as well as public
 
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 align:start position:0%
health officials we're all dependent on
 
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 align:start position:0%
the public health agencies for their
 
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 align:start position:0%
postauthorization safety monitoring to
 
00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:54.039 align:start position:0%
have a more complete profile and that's
 
00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:55.639 align:start position:0%
why we sought these
 
00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 align:start position:0%
records so the bulk of my presentation
 
00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be talking about how did
 
00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 align:start position:0%
the um agencies respond to these Foya
 
00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
requests and in short and I'll talk
 
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
about this in more detail um we learned
 
00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:10.479 align:start position:0%
um from our efforts that obtaining these
 
00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
records is a challenge due to denials
 
00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:15.319 align:start position:0%
delays and redactions and more about
 
00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 align:start position:0%
those in a few minutes um we managed so
 
00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 align:start position:0%
far to get some records during
 
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
litigation and these have pointed to
 
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
safety concerns that haven't been widely
 
00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:25.960 align:start position:0%
discussed or acknowledged by the
 
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.000 align:start position:0%
agencies so so the question then is you
 
00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 align:start position:0%
know why do these um responses to foyer
 
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
requests matter to this committee and I
 
00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
would submit to you that it is because
 
00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:39.080 align:start position:0%
you know the agencies continue to
 
00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
Proclaim that the shots are safe and to
 
00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:43.880 align:start position:0%
advise nearly Universal uptake and to
 
00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
the extent that New Hampshire like other
 
00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:49.160 align:start position:0%
states relies on the agency's guidance
 
00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:52.280 align:start position:0%
and Direction um a lack of transparency
 
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
about postauthorization safety
 
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
monitoring is certainly something to be
 
00:06:59.790 --> 00:06:59.800 align:start position:0%
aware of and to consider
 
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
so just by way of sort of background the
 
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:04.280 align:start position:0%
kind of legal framework for the work
 
00:07:06.589 --> 00:07:06.599 align:start position:0%
that we did here's just a quick summary
 
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
of the Freedom of Information Act the
 
00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:10.039 align:start position:0%
federal statute New Hampshire all states
 
00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:12.039 align:start position:0%
have analoges you're probably familiar
 
00:07:13.869 --> 00:07:13.879 align:start position:0%
with this but just in case anybody just
 
00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:16.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't know the basics basically the
 
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:17.960 align:start position:0%
way that this federal statute works is
 
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
that it requires a federal agency to
 
00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:24.199 align:start position:0%
respond to a properly formulated request
 
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
for records in a timely fashion um and
 
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
it also requires expedited processing of
 
00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:32.360 align:start position:0%
requests when there is um when certain
 
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
criteria are met including when there's
 
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
an urgent re need for public disclosure
 
00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
of the records and so I'm not going to
 
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
we we don't need to worry so much about
 
00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
the details of how much time generally
 
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
you know it's three weeks generally um
 
00:07:47.309 --> 00:07:47.319 align:start position:0%
um and then there you know there
 
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
extensions for various reasons but
 
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:51.080 align:start position:0%
generally you know under the foia
 
00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
records are to be produced with a matter
 
00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
of weeks or perhaps months but certainly
 
00:07:58.909 --> 00:07:58.919 align:start position:0%
not years um so in a nutshell the way
 
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
that agents process foyer requests and
 
00:08:02.589 --> 00:08:02.599 align:start position:0%
I'm leaving out a lot of information
 
00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
here but just the stuff that you need to
 
00:08:06.149 --> 00:08:06.159 align:start position:0%
know for this presentation is that
 
00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
basically the agency will look for
 
00:08:10.029 --> 00:08:10.039 align:start position:0%
records and then conduct various
 
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:11.960 align:start position:0%
searches and then do a review of the
 
00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:13.400 align:start position:0%
records that they uncover to see if
 
00:08:14.909 --> 00:08:14.919 align:start position:0%
they're actually responsive to the
 
00:08:16.909 --> 00:08:16.919 align:start position:0%
request and then if the records are
 
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
responsive to the request the agency
 
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
goes through and looks for material that
 
00:08:22.909 --> 00:08:22.919 align:start position:0%
might be exempt under the act because um
 
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
they're they're allowed to redact that
 
00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:27.240 align:start position:0%
material there are nine Foya exemptions
 
00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:29.960 align:start position:0%
and so if any portion of the records
 
00:08:32.269 --> 00:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
falls under an exemption the agency can
 
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:34.760 align:start position:0%
withhold it entirely or redact it but
 
00:08:36.829 --> 00:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
but the agency has to provide the
 
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
request or with the non-exempt portions
 
00:08:40.389 --> 00:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
of the record to the extent that those
 
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
can be teased apart and also needs to
 
00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
explain the
 
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
redactions um and and this is important
 
00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:48.360 align:start position:0%
um for what I'm going to be talking
 
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
about you know if a if an agency doesn't
 
00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:52.360 align:start position:0%
meet its foer obligations whether
 
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't respond to a request
 
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
or because it um redacts materials that
 
00:09:00.069 --> 00:09:00.079 align:start position:0%
really should be disclosed um um or it
 
00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
denies a request if it does any of those
 
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
things um the requestor can sue in
 
00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:06.440 align:start position:0%
federal court and ask a judge to order
 
00:09:10.069 --> 00:09:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
records so so now in terms of just a
 
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
little bit more background before I talk
 
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:18.040 align:start position:0%
about the requests that we filed um
 
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
there were basically three types of
 
00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
postauthorization safety monitoring that
 
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
were the basis for our different
 
00:09:25.949 --> 00:09:25.959 align:start position:0%
requests and I'm just going to talk a
 
00:09:28.949 --> 00:09:28.959 align:start position:0%
little bit about each of those um the
 
00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:31.160 align:start position:0%
first is one that you've probably heard
 
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
about this is monitoring of vs the
 
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:35.800 align:start position:0%
vaccine Adverse Events reporting system
 
00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
which is the nation's early warning
 
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:39.880 align:start position:0%
system for safety signals for especially
 
00:09:41.829 --> 00:09:41.839 align:start position:0%
for new vaccines and and the and the
 
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
goal of this monitoring was to identify
 
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
potential new safety concerns now I'm
 
00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:49.160 align:start position:0%
going to click through um and see are
 
00:09:52.269 --> 00:09:52.279 align:start position:0%
you seeing um open vs on the slide that
 
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
I'm showing you okay so so you probably
 
00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
are aware the um the vaccine theirs is a
 
00:09:59.829 --> 00:09:59.839 align:start position:0%
system it's called a passive reporting
 
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
system because nobody goes out and looks
 
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
for reports of Adverse Events but people
 
00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:06.440 align:start position:0%
can come to theirs and make reports if
 
00:10:08.069 --> 00:10:08.079 align:start position:0%
they're injured if loved ones are
 
00:10:10.069 --> 00:10:10.079 align:start position:0%
injured if you're a doctor if a patient
 
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
is injured or or suffer some sort of
 
00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:14.600 align:start position:0%
adverse event after a vaccine we don't
 
00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
know if it's caused by the vaccine or
 
00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
not and so Theirs to date has captured
 
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
about 2.6 million Adverse Events for all
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
vaccines combined and when we look at
 
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
the at the covid vaccines um we discover
 
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
that 1.6 million of the total 2.6
 
00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
million vaccine um reports of of Adverse
 
00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:40.600 align:start position:0%
Events are about the covid shots um so
 
00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of people pointed to that
 
00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:45.800 align:start position:0%
very high number and are concerned
 
00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:47.480 align:start position:0%
naturally that there are so many Adverse
 
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
Events reported after the shots but the
 
00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
thing that's important to remember and
 
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
that the agencies are quick to stress is
 
00:10:54.509 --> 00:10:54.519 align:start position:0%
that you know the fact that something's
 
00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
been reported to vs as an adverse event
 
00:10:58.750 --> 00:10:58.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that it was caused by the
 
00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:01.560 align:start position:0%
shot and to sort of learn from there is
 
00:11:02.949 --> 00:11:02.959 align:start position:0%
you know whether there is some kind of
 
00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:05.000 align:start position:0%
causal link between the shots and the
 
00:11:07.069 --> 00:11:07.079 align:start position:0%
Adverse Events you need to do a deeper
 
00:11:09.389 --> 00:11:09.399 align:start position:0%
dive and that's what we were seeking
 
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
records of so there's a um in
 
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
2021 the CDC put out something called
 
00:11:19.069 --> 00:11:19.079 align:start position:0%
the um which I'm trying to show you now
 
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
called the standard operating procedure
 
00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:26.720 align:start position:0%
for um covid-19 vacines um and um um and
 
00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
what this did what this document did
 
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
this was a protocol which outlined the
 
00:11:34.829 --> 00:11:34.839 align:start position:0%
various steps that the CDC and the FDA
 
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
were going to take to monitor vs to look
 
00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
for safety signals a signal that maybe
 
00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:43.160 align:start position:0%
the events reported to theirs were
 
00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:45.839 align:start position:0%
caused by the shots and so this is a
 
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
fairly detailed document and I'm not
 
00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:48.760 align:start position:0%
going to go through it now the link is
 
00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
in the PowerPoint um but the thing the
 
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
the the sum up is this that um the the
 
00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:56.680 align:start position:0%
the there's very specific actions that
 
00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
the agencies are supposed to take and
 
00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:01.279 align:start position:0%
these include include re receiving daily
 
00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
summaries from the vars contractor with
 
00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
a Roundup of the the days Adverse Events
 
00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
that they receive so just just sort of
 
00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
numbers and and um and vers ID um uh
 
00:12:13.069 --> 00:12:13.079 align:start position:0%
numbers of Adverse Events and vers ID
 
00:12:15.269 --> 00:12:15.279 align:start position:0%
numbers every day snapshot of what they
 
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
were getting every day both agencies
 
00:12:19.189 --> 00:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
were supposed to conduct manual or
 
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
clinical review of some various selected
 
00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
adver events so that means looking at
 
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
the medical records doing sort of a
 
00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
deeper dive um and then and these are
 
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
the pieces that we were particular
 
00:12:31.389 --> 00:12:31.399 align:start position:0%
interested in both agencies were
 
00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:34.120 align:start position:0%
supposed to do forms of data mining
 
00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
which actually used different
 
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
statistical methods to look for a signal
 
00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
that needed that that might um require
 
00:12:44.269 --> 00:12:44.279 align:start position:0%
further investigation to determine
 
00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
whether there really was a safety issue
 
00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
and so the CDC did something called
 
00:12:51.829 --> 00:12:51.839 align:start position:0%
proportional reporting ratios or prr
 
00:12:53.069 --> 00:12:53.079 align:start position:0%
which you may have heard about and
 
00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:55.240 align:start position:0%
that's a fairly straightforward
 
00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:56.680 align:start position:0%
technique although I don't honestly
 
00:12:58.910 --> 00:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
fully understand it but where where what
 
00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
the agency does is um uh measure the
 
00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:06.920 align:start position:0%
percentage of some the adverse event of
 
00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:10.240 align:start position:0%
interest um in the vaccine that's being
 
00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
studied against a comparator vaccine to
 
00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:15.240 align:start position:0%
see if the adverse event is appearing
 
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
more than expected in um in the whatever
 
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
the vaccine is that you're looking at so
 
00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
in this case it would be the covid shots
 
00:13:24.829 --> 00:13:24.839 align:start position:0%
and so um so the and and if the if the
 
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
pr number is above two and various other
 
00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
statistical you know s uh numbers are
 
00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:32.680 align:start position:0%
sort of thresholds are passed then that
 
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
means there's a safety signal and what
 
00:13:37.269 --> 00:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
the v's sop said is that the CDC would
 
00:13:39.269 --> 00:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
further investigate and if necessary do
 
00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
a clinical review to see if the signal
 
00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
really you know really showed a safety
 
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
concern in other words a causal link
 
00:13:48.189 --> 00:13:48.199 align:start position:0%
between the shots and the adverse event
 
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:50.680 align:start position:0%
and at the same time what the vs sop
 
00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
said was that the FDA would do something
 
00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
called empirical basian data mining
 
00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
which is a sort of complimentary but
 
00:14:00.189 --> 00:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
different form of of of data analysis
 
00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
where the comparator instead of other
 
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:04.720 align:start position:0%
vaccines is actually the the expected
 
00:14:07.269 --> 00:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
rates of certain events in the general
 
00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
population this is as I understand it
 
00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:11.720 align:start position:0%
very crude uh I'm I'm giving you a very
 
00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
crude crude overview here I'm not a
 
00:14:14.829 --> 00:14:14.839 align:start position:0%
statistician but just so you get a sense
 
00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
that they're two different methods both
 
00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
of which are designed to detect signals
 
00:14:21.509 --> 00:14:21.519 align:start position:0%
of possible problems and which work in
 
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
sort of complimentary fashion and if
 
00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
there was a signal detected anywhere the
 
00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:28.120 align:start position:0%
CDC and the FDA were supposed to follow
 
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
up on it and they were supposed to also
 
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
be in regular communication to discuss
 
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
any safety signals that they had so so
 
00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:36.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's the one the first kind of
 
00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:39.320 align:start position:0%
monitoring that we that we um that we
 
00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:41.800 align:start position:0%
were looking for was was this taking
 
00:14:43.949 --> 00:14:43.959 align:start position:0%
this sort of passive data collection
 
00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:46.120 align:start position:0%
system that vers is but actually diving
 
00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:48.160 align:start position:0%
into the data to see if there are any
 
00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:50.120 align:start position:0%
signals that needed to be followed up on
 
00:14:52.949 --> 00:14:52.959 align:start position:0%
and then and then the followup
 
00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
um so are you seeing the PowerPoint now
 
00:14:59.150 --> 00:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
so okay so the second kind of monitoring
 
00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
that we looked at was um what's called
 
00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:03.320 align:start position:0%
active monitoring and this is monitoring
 
00:15:06.389 --> 00:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
that was conducted by um the FDA where
 
00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
they were looking at large healthc care
 
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
databases to determine that the rates of
 
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
Adverse Events of special interest in
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
near real time so was up to the minute
 
00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
to identify possible increased risks of
 
00:15:20.749 --> 00:15:20.759 align:start position:0%
certain Adverse Events of special
 
00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:23.519 align:start position:0%
interest after vaccination and just as
 
00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
with you know the vs monitoring the FDA
 
00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
also set forth um a a a active
 
00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:32.680 align:start position:0%
monitoring protocol that details
 
00:15:33.949 --> 00:15:33.959 align:start position:0%
everything that they're supposed to do
 
00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
this is linked also in the PowerPoint um
 
00:15:38.829 --> 00:15:38.839 align:start position:0%
and this was through cber CBE which is
 
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
the center for biologics evaluation and
 
00:15:42.829 --> 00:15:42.839 align:start position:0%
research that's the center within the
 
00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
FDA that works on vaccine safety issues
 
00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
so um so under this active monitoring
 
00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
protocol representative beler apologies
 
00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:54.839 align:start position:0%
I just I just want to interrupt to ask a
 
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
question real uh uh briefly because
 
00:15:59.069 --> 00:15:59.079 align:start position:0%
we've moved on to a different topic I
 
00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
was curious in the last one and please
 
00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
stop me if we're getting if I'm jumping
 
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
the gun and getting something you're
 
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
planning to discuss later but we have
 
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
received some previous testimony on
 
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
these similar topics and I want to ask
 
00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:13.480 align:start position:0%
can you cooperate from our previous
 
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
testimony or do you have anything
 
00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
further to to offer on um whether or not
 
00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:22.600 align:start position:0%
one or both of these organizations FDA
 
00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.110 align:start position:0%
one or both of these organizations FDA
Andor

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
Andor
 
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
CDC uh decided to abandon the pred
 
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
determined criteria for monitoring
 
00:16:34.269 --> 00:16:34.279 align:start position:0%
safety signals in
 
00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
process so I'll talk about this in a
 
00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
couple of minutes but but with respect
 
00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:44.360 align:start position:0%
to the prrs they decided not to do those
 
00:16:48.269 --> 00:16:48.279 align:start position:0%
at some point they didn't do them at the
 
00:16:52.269 --> 00:16:52.279 align:start position:0%
outset um they so so the protocol said
 
00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
you know start starting soon after the
 
00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
shots were rolled out it didn't give a
 
00:16:58.230 --> 00:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
start date but they were going to this
 
00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:00.680 align:start position:0%
was going to be going on they didn't do
 
00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
them we actually filed foyer requests
 
00:17:04.029 --> 00:17:04.039 align:start position:0%
and there was a lot of sort of back and
 
00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:06.959 align:start position:0%
forth about this um but um they said
 
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
they were going to do it we filed a
 
00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
foyer request um I think it was in the
 
00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
spring of 2022 and they said they hadn't
 
00:17:16.549 --> 00:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
done it at all um then eventually what
 
00:17:17.949 --> 00:17:17.959 align:start position:0%
they told us and I'll get to this a
 
00:17:19.549 --> 00:17:19.559 align:start position:0%
little bit later is that they did do it
 
00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:22.079 align:start position:0%
for a couple of months in 2022
 
00:17:23.789 --> 00:17:23.799 align:start position:0%
interestingly after various foyer
 
00:17:25.669 --> 00:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
requests for the the records had been
 
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
filed and um and they just and they said
 
00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:30.760 align:start position:0%
that they just did it to corroborate the
 
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
EB mining data so I don't know if that's
 
00:17:34.669 --> 00:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
what you're referring to but that is the
 
00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:35.960 align:start position:0%
that's the information that we have from
 
00:17:38.029 --> 00:17:38.039 align:start position:0%
the CDC about yes thank you that's and
 
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
that was just it was testimony we
 
00:17:42.549 --> 00:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
received previously from uh attorney
 
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
Aaron Siri based on his own um uh
 
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
lawsuits requiring information that
 
00:17:52.669 --> 00:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
seemed to determine that one of these
 
00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:54.760 align:start position:0%
organizations that had developed
 
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
pre-existing criteria for how they were
 
00:18:00.029 --> 00:18:00.039 align:start position:0%
going to monitor safety decided to
 
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
abandon entirely their criteria and go
 
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
with the other criteria for some reason
 
00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
and we we have a letter from the CDC
 
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
saying that they did that which is in
 
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
the material so yeah the um but um yes
 
00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
that's right and interestingly they did
 
00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
you know the the um the SOP that I
 
00:18:18.909 --> 00:18:18.919 align:start position:0%
projected which is the one that we base
 
00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
our foyer request on was issued in
 
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:22.120 align:start position:0%
February of
 
00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:25.480 align:start position:0%
2021 um it was revised and reissued I
 
00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:29.039 align:start position:0%
think in 2022 and and it still had those
 
00:18:32.029 --> 00:18:32.039 align:start position:0%
monitoring systems listed as within the
 
00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
protocols so you know and I don't know I
 
00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
haven't looked at subsequent I don't
 
00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:37.880 align:start position:0%
know if there are subsequent iterations
 
00:18:39.669 --> 00:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
of it they did say it was just a draft
 
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
and but the other thing about that's
 
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
interesting about the pr is that they
 
00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:44.360 align:start position:0%
use that for other vaccines I mean this
 
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
is not some sort of you know Fly by
 
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
Night monitoring kind of system it's
 
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
something that they certainly we've seen
 
00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
records of the amum with flu vaccines
 
00:18:54.029 --> 00:18:54.039 align:start position:0%
and other ones so oh sure we would fully
 
00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
expect that if they determined pre you
 
00:18:57.029 --> 00:18:57.039 align:start position:0%
know beforehand that they were going to
 
00:18:59.230 --> 00:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
use this it it would be a you know a
 
00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
known and tested methodology yeah yeah
 
00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:04.799 align:start position:0%
and I think you know worked syner
 
00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:06.440 align:start position:0%
synergistically with the with the EV
 
00:19:09.669 --> 00:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
mining yeah that's that's right so so
 
00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:11.480 align:start position:0%
then in terms of the active monitoring
 
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
protocol um this this one um I'm
 
00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
actually less familiar with but but it's
 
00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
basically again looking at at at large
 
00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
database so this is It's considered
 
00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:23.720 align:start position:0%
active monitoring because the the FDA is
 
00:19:26.029 --> 00:19:26.039 align:start position:0%
going and looking for the reports as
 
00:19:27.789 --> 00:19:27.799 align:start position:0%
opposed to just the passive system like
 
00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:30.280 align:start position:0%
vs which accept reports so it's going to
 
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
go into I think Insurance databases a
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
bunch of different databases look for
 
00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:35.720 align:start position:0%
the rates of certain Adverse Events of
 
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
special interest analyze them um
 
00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:40.120 align:start position:0%
compared to a control Baseline you know
 
00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
looking for signals and then verify
 
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
possible safety signals so this is a
 
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
different monitoring system that's
 
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
supposed to be you know it captures a
 
00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:49.480 align:start position:0%
much larger data set because you know vs
 
00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
only captures a fraction of of of the
 
00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
Adverse Events that are out there I mean
 
00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
there's studies showing I think it's
 
00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
between 1 and 10% something like that
 
00:19:59.950 --> 00:19:59.960 align:start position:0%
and so the active protocol sort of in in
 
00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:01.720 align:start position:0%
a certain sense attempts to make up for
 
00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:03.640 align:start position:0%
that by going out to you know these
 
00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
large databases where there are claims
 
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
you know made by people who might not
 
00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:09.400 align:start position:0%
think to report to vs but the but the
 
00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
information is there that they suffered
 
00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
some consequence you know after or some
 
00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:16.760 align:start position:0%
some effect after taking a vaccine so
 
00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:20.120 align:start position:0%
the Third Kind of um safety monitoring
 
00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
that we um sought records for is
 
00:20:24.029 --> 00:20:24.039 align:start position:0%
something that I don't know that the
 
00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:25.720 align:start position:0%
agencies would consider safety
 
00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:27.480 align:start position:0%
monitoring at all but I would submit
 
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
really is a form of monitoring and that
 
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
is the sort of unofficial anecdotal
 
00:20:34.029 --> 00:20:34.039 align:start position:0%
monitoring through the receipt of
 
00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
communications that came to the agencies
 
00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
that were sent by vaccine injured
 
00:20:40.669 --> 00:20:40.679 align:start position:0%
individuals or people who believed that
 
00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:42.200 align:start position:0%
they were vaccine injured people who
 
00:20:44.029 --> 00:20:44.039 align:start position:0%
suffered you know really adverse
 
00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
consequences within a short time of
 
00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:48.280 align:start position:0%
taking the vaccines and in particular we
 
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
learned about um I think probably all
 
00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:53.320 align:start position:0%
the agencies received emails like this
 
00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
but what we learned about in particular
 
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
was that there was a group of scientists
 
00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
at the NIH who in early 2021 started to
 
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
hear from people with severe
 
00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
neurological and other injuries and they
 
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
actually they were very sympathetic and
 
00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
they started working with these people
 
00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what was going on
 
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
they brought them to DC some of them for
 
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
testing they actually wrote a study
 
00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:15.320 align:start position:0%
which is linked I'm not going to I'm not
 
00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
going to bother showing you that but
 
00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
they wrote a study about 23 of the
 
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
people who they had who who had come to
 
00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
them for help um and so you know it
 
00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:25.000 align:start position:0%
seems like there were a lot of
 
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
individuals who reached out to the NIH
 
00:21:29.669 --> 00:21:29.679 align:start position:0%
and so we were very interested in those
 
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
Communications for different reasons so
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
again it's not something that the that
 
00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:35.320 align:start position:0%
the federal agencies would consider an
 
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
official form of monitoring but you know
 
00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
it was unsolicited receipt of events
 
00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:42.200 align:start position:0%
from people who had no reason to reach
 
00:21:44.029 --> 00:21:44.039 align:start position:0%
out to federal agencies about their
 
00:21:45.789 --> 00:21:45.799 align:start position:0%
injuries unless they were really
 
00:21:45.799 --> 00:21:47.430 align:start position:0%
injuries unless they were really
suffering

00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
suffering
 
00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
um so so now that so those are the three
 
00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
systems the theirs the active and The
 
00:21:55.149 --> 00:21:55.159 align:start position:0%
Unofficial and so now let me just talk
 
00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
about I'm going to really talk about
 
00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
it's uh uh four four requests although
 
00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:01.039 align:start position:0%
two of them were double requests so
 
00:22:03.549 --> 00:22:03.559 align:start position:0%
first was that we submitted um in August
 
00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:05.720 align:start position:0%
and September of 2022 we submitted
 
00:22:09.149 --> 00:22:09.159 align:start position:0%
requests to CDC for records of the vs
 
00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:11.080 align:start position:0%
monitoring that was outlined in the
 
00:22:13.909 --> 00:22:13.919 align:start position:0%
cdc's protocol and we took the requests
 
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
pretty much directly from the protocol
 
00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
we asked for the daily priority reports
 
00:22:20.149 --> 00:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
which are the summaries of the day's
 
00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:22.200 align:start position:0%
Adverse Events from the vs contractor
 
00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
who was General Dynamics General
 
00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:25.880 align:start position:0%
Dynamics was administering the the the
 
00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
database um we sought manual review of
 
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
the Adverse Events reports um we sought
 
00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
um the results of the prr analysis that
 
00:22:37.149 --> 00:22:37.159 align:start position:0%
they were supposed to do and the
 
00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:39.320 align:start position:0%
communications within the CDC and the
 
00:22:41.549 --> 00:22:41.559 align:start position:0%
between the CDC and the FDA and we
 
00:22:43.669 --> 00:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
sought follow records of the follow-up
 
00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:45.080 align:start position:0%
investigation that they did of any
 
00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
safety signals that they
 
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
uncovered we filed a similar request um
 
00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
with the FDA actually a little earlier
 
00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
that was in July of 2022 and we asked
 
00:22:55.789 --> 00:22:55.799 align:start position:0%
for their manual review of serious
 
00:22:57.990 --> 00:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
Adverse Events reports the results of
 
00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:01.720 align:start position:0%
the B Data Mining and um any discussions
 
00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:04.760 align:start position:0%
or consults with the CDC regarding the
 
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
data analysis results and the
 
00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:08.440 align:start position:0%
investigation of safety signals so
 
00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
that's kind of like a pair of requests
 
00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:11.960 align:start position:0%
but that we sent them to the CDC and the
 
00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
FDA because we figured each agency had
 
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
internal Communications their own data
 
00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:18.440 align:start position:0%
analysis as well as you know whatever
 
00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:20.200 align:start position:0%
kind of crossover there
 
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
was in terms of the active monitoring we
 
00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
filed a request um with the FDA on in
 
00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
September of 2022 asking for those
 
00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
descript summaries of you know the rates
 
00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:31.640 align:start position:0%
of Adverse Events in the different
 
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
databases the any analyses that they did
 
00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
and then any signal verification they
 
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
did if they discovered any safety
 
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
signals through their analyses and
 
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
finally um the last request that I'm
 
00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
going to talk about today is um that we
 
00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
we sought the um in November of 2022 we
 
00:23:49.789 --> 00:23:49.799 align:start position:0%
asked ni to provide for us records of
 
00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
the communications uh between NIH
 
00:23:54.029 --> 00:23:54.039 align:start position:0%
scientists and the injured individuals
 
00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:55.960 align:start position:0%
who reached out to them and also among
 
00:23:58.110 --> 00:23:58.120 align:start position:0%
the NIH scientists discussing you know
 
00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:00.440 align:start position:0%
the situation of the people who um who
 
00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
reached out to them so all of these
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
requests you could say were filed about
 
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
two years ago give or take right we're
 
00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:08.120 align:start position:0%
in September
 
00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:10.710 align:start position:0%
in September
2024

00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:10.720 align:start position:0%
2024
 
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
um the other thing I should note is that
 
00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
with all these requests we sought
 
00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:17.240 align:start position:0%
expedited processing um and you know
 
00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
what we so expedited processing as I
 
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
said earlier you know is under the Foya
 
00:24:23.789 --> 00:24:23.799 align:start position:0%
statute if there's an a public urgency
 
00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:25.640 align:start position:0%
for the records you know the agencies
 
00:24:28.389 --> 00:24:28.399 align:start position:0%
are basically supposed to push the
 
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
request to the head of whatever
 
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
processing cues they're in and and
 
00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:35.080 align:start position:0%
provide the records as soon as
 
00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:37.720 align:start position:0%
practicable and so in all our requests
 
00:24:39.789 --> 00:24:39.799 align:start position:0%
we included very detailed maybe to
 
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
detailed requests for expedited
 
00:24:42.789 --> 00:24:42.799 align:start position:0%
processing and if you think about what
 
00:24:45.389 --> 00:24:45.399 align:start position:0%
was going on in 2022 there was a lot of
 
00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
controversy about vaccine mandates there
 
00:24:49.149 --> 00:24:49.159 align:start position:0%
were people who were very concerned
 
00:24:52.669 --> 00:24:52.679 align:start position:0%
about safety everyone individuals as
 
00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:54.440 align:start position:0%
well as public health officials had to
 
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
make decisions about shots and about
 
00:24:59.350 --> 00:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
boosters I mean this was a very very
 
00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
live and Urgent issue and records of the
 
00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
agency's safety monitoring obviously
 
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
were very very significant to everybody
 
00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:10.240 align:start position:0%
so we did seek expedited processing in
 
00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
all four of these
 
00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
requests um so now I'm going to talk a
 
00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
little bit about how the agencies
 
00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:20.200 align:start position:0%
responded to the foyer requests after we
 
00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:22.840 align:start position:0%
filed them and I would say that
 
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
basically you know after the requests
 
00:25:28.909 --> 00:25:28.919 align:start position:0%
were filed we basically hit a wall um
 
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
and so um so let me go through one by
 
00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
one just briefly talking about what
 
00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
happened with each of these
 
00:25:39.389 --> 00:25:39.399 align:start position:0%
requests so the v's uh request that we
 
00:25:41.909 --> 00:25:41.919 align:start position:0%
submitted to the CDC actually the CDC
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
granted expedited processing for that
 
00:25:45.549 --> 00:25:45.559 align:start position:0%
request and then we had a bit of
 
00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
communication back and forth because
 
00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
they said that the request was too broad
 
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
so I provided some narrowing information
 
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
and they agreed that they were all set
 
00:25:54.389 --> 00:25:54.399 align:start position:0%
that I had provided whatever information
 
00:25:56.269 --> 00:25:56.279 align:start position:0%
they needed to conduct the searches
 
00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
because they can't search every email
 
00:26:00.269 --> 00:26:00.279 align:start position:0%
account in the CDC for example so I gave
 
00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:01.960 align:start position:0%
them you know more information about
 
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
where these records might be located um
 
00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
and they told us that the records would
 
00:26:08.909 --> 00:26:08.919 align:start position:0%
be provided by December 2022 so that was
 
00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
longer than we wanted to wait but we
 
00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:11.960 align:start position:0%
thought you know that's that's still
 
00:26:14.549 --> 00:26:14.559 align:start position:0%
pretty good we'll take that um December
 
00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:16.520 align:start position:0%
came and went we didn't get the records
 
00:26:18.389 --> 00:26:18.399 align:start position:0%
we emailed them in January to ask them
 
00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
about the records we didn't hear from
 
00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
them so we're sort of at a dead
 
00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
end the request to the FDA for the vers
 
00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:26.840 align:start position:0%
monitoring records it was kind of
 
00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
interesting um the first the FDA denied
 
00:26:31.149 --> 00:26:31.159 align:start position:0%
expedited processing and then they
 
00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
denied the request in its entirety
 
00:26:35.909 --> 00:26:35.919 align:start position:0%
without searching for records and they
 
00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
said that all of the records were exempt
 
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
under something called the deliberative
 
00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
process exemption which is a Foya
 
00:26:44.549 --> 00:26:44.559 align:start position:0%
exemption um that is sort of reserved
 
00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
for internal Communications within an
 
00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
agency or between agencies when the
 
00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:51.039 align:start position:0%
agency is trying to reach a policy
 
00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
decision and the and the point of the um
 
00:26:56.029 --> 00:26:56.039 align:start position:0%
of the exemption is sort of sort of to
 
00:26:57.549 --> 00:26:57.559 align:start position:0%
like like like it's sort of like going
 
00:26:58.710 --> 00:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
you should be able to to go into
 
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
executive sessions sometimes it's sort
 
00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:02.720 align:start position:0%
of it's that sort of thing right just to
 
00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:05.320 align:start position:0%
to protect the deliberative process so
 
00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
we knew that these records were not at
 
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
least not in their entirety protected by
 
00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:11.720 align:start position:0%
the deliberative process um so we filed
 
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
an administrative appeal with the agency
 
00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
which is something that you have to do
 
00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
before you Sue and then we asked them
 
00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
you know how long is it going to take
 
00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:19.880 align:start position:0%
for you to look at this appeal we really
 
00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
think you need to look for these records
 
00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
you can't just deny a request out
 
00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:25.480 align:start position:0%
outright and the statute is and and the
 
00:27:27.269 --> 00:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
and HHS regulations are very clear that
 
00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:29.320 align:start position:0%
an agency isn't supposed to deny a
 
00:27:30.669 --> 00:27:30.679 align:start position:0%
request outright they're supposed to
 
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
look for the records go through them
 
00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
segregate the non-exempt information
 
00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
tell the requestor at least how many
 
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
records They uncovered and they didn't
 
00:27:39.669 --> 00:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
do any of this so we filed the
 
00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:41.320 align:start position:0%
administrative appeal and then when we
 
00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
reached out to them they told us it
 
00:27:44.549 --> 00:27:44.559 align:start position:0%
would be another 9 to 12 months before
 
00:27:46.269 --> 00:27:46.279 align:start position:0%
they ruled on the administrative appeal
 
00:27:48.029 --> 00:27:48.039 align:start position:0%
so again we're sort of hit a dead end we
 
00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
hit a wall um for the active monitoring
 
00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:53.240 align:start position:0%
the FDA records we didn't hear anything
 
00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
from them we filed the request in
 
00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
September didn't hear anything didn't
 
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
hear anything we may have reached out to
 
00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
them before may I don't I don't remember
 
00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
if I did or not but in may they told us
 
00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
that this request was in the complex
 
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
processing que at seer's Foya office um
 
00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
and that it wouldn't be assigned for
 
00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:12.200 align:start position:0%
processing for at least another 24
 
00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:14.360 align:start position:0%
months um and it turns out that this was
 
00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
the fate of we have several other
 
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
requests to the FDA for safety mod
 
00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:20.200 align:start position:0%
related to the covid shots which I'm not
 
00:28:21.789 --> 00:28:21.799 align:start position:0%
going to talk about today but we were
 
00:28:23.389 --> 00:28:23.399 align:start position:0%
told the same thing basically with those
 
00:28:24.789 --> 00:28:24.799 align:start position:0%
it's going to be at least 24 months
 
00:28:29.389 --> 00:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:32.509 --> 00:28:32.519 align:start position:0%
just a quick question so we're dealing
 
00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:35.240 align:start position:0%
with public health um we're we're asking
 
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
people I know that we're in
 
00:28:43.149 --> 00:28:43.159 align:start position:0%
a emergency phase in this country during
 
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
covid um but Public Health
 
00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
policy I would think when we're dealing
 
00:28:54.029 --> 00:28:54.039 align:start position:0%
with data because we you know science
 
00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
and data is constantly evolving and
 
00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:00.440 align:start position:0%
changing that this information should
 
00:29:03.789 --> 00:29:03.799 align:start position:0%
have been out at least to some PE people
 
00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
in the public if not the entire public
 
00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
is there any is this typical or is this
 
00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
non-typical of uh these foyer requests
 
00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
so that's a great question I don't have
 
00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
enough experience to know um I can say
 
00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:20.200 align:start position:0%
you know I know Aaron Siri Law Firm has
 
00:29:21.909 --> 00:29:21.919 align:start position:0%
had to sue for the data that they've
 
00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
gotten it hasn't been provided to them
 
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
um I personally think that we should
 
00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:28.200 align:start position:0%
have some sort of federal data transp
 
00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
parency statute we shouldn't have to
 
00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:32.240 align:start position:0%
file foyer requests and litigate to get
 
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
this information this is information
 
00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:36.440 align:start position:0%
about safety monitoring that's done at
 
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
taxpayer expense for taxpayers benefit
 
00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
and there's just no reason that we
 
00:29:42.389 --> 00:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
shouldn't see this stuff so so I you
 
00:29:43.789 --> 00:29:43.799 align:start position:0%
know I do think that there should be
 
00:29:45.549 --> 00:29:45.559 align:start position:0%
some sort of federal data transparency
 
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
statute but that's a different that's
 
00:29:48.389 --> 00:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
sort of outside the scope of my Tex
 
00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
testimony but personal opinion so but I
 
00:29:52.509 --> 00:29:52.519 align:start position:0%
but it seems certainly in the context of
 
00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
the covid shots that this is really you
 
00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
know this has been a real problem um
 
00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:01.000 align:start position:0%
so um the last thing is the
 
00:30:03.549 --> 00:30:03.559 align:start position:0%
communications with the NIH scientists
 
00:30:05.509 --> 00:30:05.519 align:start position:0%
initiated by vaccine indiv injured
 
00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
individuals which we filed in November
 
00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
of 2022 initially we got some responses
 
00:30:11.389 --> 00:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
from the Foy office that said we don't
 
00:30:13.509 --> 00:30:13.519 align:start position:0%
have any records like these the CDC and
 
00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
the FDA are the ones who deal with
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine injuries so you should file your
 
00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:20.120 align:start position:0%
request with them and we fired back and
 
00:30:21.789 --> 00:30:21.799 align:start position:0%
we we showed the couple there couple of
 
00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
articles that we've Linked In This
 
00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
PowerPoint about about these
 
00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
communications it's very clear that they
 
00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
happened so eventually um they agreed
 
00:30:31.269 --> 00:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
that they had the communication some
 
00:30:32.909 --> 00:30:32.919 align:start position:0%
Communications but they asked us to
 
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
narrow the request which we did and we
 
00:30:36.269 --> 00:30:36.279 align:start position:0%
had some back and forth about that but
 
00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:38.600 align:start position:0%
then in the spring when I checked you
 
00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
can you can go online and look at your
 
00:30:42.389 --> 00:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
request status on the on your on a foia
 
00:30:45.029 --> 00:30:45.039 align:start position:0%
portal I discovered that in in March of
 
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
2023 the request was still listed as on
 
00:30:49.389 --> 00:30:49.399 align:start position:0%
hold needing clarification even though I
 
00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
had clarified it in November um and then
 
00:30:54.789 --> 00:30:54.799 align:start position:0%
in April um it said that the request had
 
00:30:56.509 --> 00:30:56.519 align:start position:0%
been received but it didn't indicate
 
00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
that it was actually in process and many
 
00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
many months had passed so we were really
 
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
up against a wall with this one too so
 
00:31:06.389 --> 00:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
what we did um eventually is we sued on
 
00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
all four requests and what's on this
 
00:31:10.269 --> 00:31:10.279 align:start position:0%
slide is just sort of the cover pages of
 
00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
the complaints that we filed we filed
 
00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
one against the CDC for the v's
 
00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
monitoring records one against the FDA
 
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
for the vars monitoring records one
 
00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:19.880 align:start position:0%
against the FDA for the active
 
00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
monitoring and one against the NIH for
 
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
the for the email
 
00:31:27.389 --> 00:31:27.399 align:start position:0%
Communications um and um so now what I
 
00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:29.080 align:start position:0%
want to talk about a little bit is how
 
00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
the agencies responded to the lawsuits
 
00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
um and I'll start with the CDC so so
 
00:31:38.549 --> 00:31:38.559 align:start position:0%
what happens with a foil lawsuit you
 
00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
know or what can happen is that you know
 
00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
after the the lawsuit is filed and
 
00:31:44.909 --> 00:31:44.919 align:start position:0%
sometimes even before the agency answers
 
00:31:46.909 --> 00:31:46.919 align:start position:0%
the complaint you know the council for
 
00:31:49.269 --> 00:31:49.279 align:start position:0%
the agency will reach out and and the
 
00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
parties the requestor in the agency will
 
00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:53.960 align:start position:0%
start to negotiate the production of the
 
00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
records because everybody knows that you
 
00:31:58.230 --> 00:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
know the courts do not want to be LED
 
00:32:00.509 --> 00:32:00.519 align:start position:0%
with these kinds of lawsuits and to the
 
00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
extent that you know the parties can
 
00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
sort of work things out between
 
00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:04.799 align:start position:0%
themselves that's always better for
 
00:32:07.389 --> 00:32:07.399 align:start position:0%
everyone and so when we filed suit with
 
00:32:09.629 --> 00:32:09.639 align:start position:0%
the CDC that's what happened that they
 
00:32:11.389 --> 00:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
they the council for the CDC reached out
 
00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
to us and they they began producing
 
00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
records pretty much right away in the
 
00:32:18.909 --> 00:32:18.919 align:start position:0%
spring of 2023 and so I'm going to talk
 
00:32:20.509 --> 00:32:20.519 align:start position:0%
a little bit about those Productions
 
00:32:22.509 --> 00:32:22.519 align:start position:0%
because I think um you know there
 
00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:24.760 align:start position:0%
there's some noteworthy aspects so the
 
00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:26.440 align:start position:0%
first thing is one of the first things
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
that they produced I don't remember if
 
00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
this was the first of the second was
 
00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
5,041 pages of daily priority reports
 
00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
heavily redacted and I want to show you
 
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:39.240 align:start position:0%
what I mean by heavily redacted because
 
00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:40.559 align:start position:0%
it's really
 
00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
so so what you can see here um all right
 
00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
on the on the slideshow is um this is
 
00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
from the v's nerfu which means the v's
 
00:32:57.549 --> 00:32:57.559 align:start position:0%
nursing followup this was the email
 
00:32:59.430 --> 00:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
address that General Dynamics was using
 
00:33:01.549 --> 00:33:01.559 align:start position:0%
for this stuff to lots of people at the
 
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
CDC and the FDA and this is what the
 
00:33:06.629 --> 00:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
daily priority ports look like there's a
 
00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:09.320 align:start position:0%
list of each of the vaccines and then
 
00:33:12.669 --> 00:33:12.679 align:start position:0%
the number of deaths serious non-death
 
00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
non-serious um Adverse Events um and as
 
00:33:18.509 --> 00:33:18.519 align:start position:0%
you can see the column with the total
 
00:33:20.149 --> 00:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
numbers of those is blanked out with the
 
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
B5 exemption that I was talking about
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
before deliberative process nothing
 
00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:26.200 align:start position:0%
deliberative here this is just a Roundup
 
00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
of the day's reports um then we get to
 
00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
there's more and more of that as I
 
00:33:33.789 --> 00:33:33.799 align:start position:0%
scroll through and then what we get to
 
00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
is the sort of more narrative places
 
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
where um they're supposed to be listing
 
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
the types of events and the numbers for
 
00:33:45.149 --> 00:33:45.159 align:start position:0%
the events and you can see there's more
 
00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:47.240 align:start position:0%
B5 redactions and I don't want to I
 
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
don't want to make you dizzy but I'll go
 
00:33:50.789 --> 00:33:50.799 align:start position:0%
through to like halfway through the
 
00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:56.440 align:start position:0%
reports and here you can see again
 
00:34:00.389 --> 00:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
um let's see sorry wish I had the mouse
 
00:34:03.269 --> 00:34:03.279 align:start position:0%
here but here's you know and there's
 
00:34:05.269 --> 00:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
there's P there's just pages and Pages
 
00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
like this where all of the you know
 
00:34:13.149 --> 00:34:13.159 align:start position:0%
non-serious so so represent so basically
 
00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:15.800 align:start position:0%
they gave you an unusable report I mean
 
00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
there is no data that's actionable or
 
00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:25.480 align:start position:0%
that you can review um everything of any
 
00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:27.320 align:start position:0%
consequence from data whether it's
 
00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:30.200 align:start position:0%
quanti ative or narrative is removed
 
00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
that's correct and so basically you have
 
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
nothing more than a template for their
 
00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:37.399 align:start position:0%
reports that's correct okay yeah and
 
00:34:39.869 --> 00:34:39.879 align:start position:0%
it's all under the B5 exemption which
 
00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:41.720 align:start position:0%
you know we we tried to AR you know
 
00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:43.480 align:start position:0%
early on we said to them come on this
 
00:34:45.829 --> 00:34:45.839 align:start position:0%
really this is not deliberative material
 
00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:48.040 align:start position:0%
and they said well we haven't verified
 
00:34:49.629 --> 00:34:49.639 align:start position:0%
all the reports yet so some of them
 
00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
might not be accurate so it might give a
 
00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:53.320 align:start position:0%
misleading impression of how many
 
00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:55.240 align:start position:0%
reports there were which is you know
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
number one not what the B5 exemption is
 
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
meant to cover but number two there I
 
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of a lot of incidents of
 
00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
false reports being made to vers it's a
 
00:35:05.069 --> 00:35:05.079 align:start position:0%
criminal offense to do that and
 
00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:06.280 align:start position:0%
certainly I haven't heard of a single
 
00:35:07.589 --> 00:35:07.599 align:start position:0%
case of it you know they they sort of
 
00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
talked about that as a possibility but
 
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct so you see this page
 
00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:15.560 align:start position:0%
of Sirus B5 B5 there's one page two page
 
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
so so that's what these reports look
 
00:35:18.349 --> 00:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
like and that's in the materials that
 
00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
I'm going to give you if if you want it
 
00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
it takes up a little bit of space on the
 
00:35:25.589 --> 00:35:25.599 align:start position:0%
drive but um so um okay so now back to
 
00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
the back to the slideshow
 
00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:30.520 align:start position:0%
um let's
 
00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
see so um
 
00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
second all right so those were the daily
 
00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
priority reports that they produced for
 
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
us um and and just to say so the way
 
00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:43.000 align:start position:0%
that this is going to work from here is
 
00:35:45.589 --> 00:35:45.599 align:start position:0%
that once they have produced all the
 
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
records that they say that they have
 
00:35:48.829 --> 00:35:48.839 align:start position:0%
that are responsive to the request then
 
00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:51.880 align:start position:0%
the court will consider these questions
 
00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:53.800 align:start position:0%
about the redactions we tried to get the
 
00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
court to consider this earlier because
 
00:35:57.829 --> 00:35:57.839 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a freestanding issue but
 
00:35:59.470 --> 00:35:59.480 align:start position:0%
you know for understandable reasons of
 
00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:01.480 align:start position:0%
kind of judicial economy I think the
 
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
court you know I think courts in in many
 
00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
cases prefer to wait until all you know
 
00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:07.720 align:start position:0%
until the parties have gone as far as
 
00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
they can go and then the court needs to
 
00:36:11.309 --> 00:36:11.319 align:start position:0%
step in but this is an issue that will
 
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
get resolved in summary judgment I think
 
00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
in our favor but you know transparency
 
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
delayed is transparency denied there's
 
00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
some court that said that somewhere and
 
00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
I think that that's kind of true um so
 
00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
the next thing that we got from the CDC
 
00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
was we got um the pr results for March
 
00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
through July of 2022 so they they did do
 
00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:35.240 align:start position:0%
this PR data mining for approximately
 
00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
four months um before we got the data
 
00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
they they sent three weeks three weeks
 
00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:43.480 align:start position:0%
worth I think to the um Epoch times we
 
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
were sort of foing in tandem with the
 
00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
epoch times um I have links in here that
 
00:36:51.069 --> 00:36:51.079 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to go through to but but
 
00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is that the four months
 
00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
of records that the CDC sent showed a
 
00:36:58.589 --> 00:36:58.599 align:start position:0%
lot of safety signals and all those
 
00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:01.160 align:start position:0%
records are in the materials that I put
 
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
together for the committee and so you
 
00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:04.040 align:start position:0%
can you can take a look at those for
 
00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:06.200 align:start position:0%
yourself I also put a couple of analytic
 
00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
articles that kind of points you you
 
00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:09.800 align:start position:0%
know sort of can help you to Wade
 
00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
through because it's a lot of it's a lot
 
00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
of spreadsheets um the CDC said you know
 
00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
they decided to rely exclusively on the
 
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
EB mining because it's a more robust
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
data mining technique not sure why that
 
00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:25.000 align:start position:0%
is but that's what they said and that
 
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
they only did the pr to Corr at this the
 
00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:30.200 align:start position:0%
EB mining results and what they said
 
00:37:31.349 --> 00:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
it's kind of interesting a little
 
00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:33.880 align:start position:0%
cryptic they said that the pr results
 
00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:35.960 align:start position:0%
were consistent with the EB Mining and
 
00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
this is in quotes revealing no
 
00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:42.040 align:start position:0%
additional unexpected safety signals so
 
00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
you have to sort of parse that for
 
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
yourselves but um but that's that's that
 
00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:47.720 align:start position:0%
was part of the production for us and
 
00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
that's in one of the letters that they
 
00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
sent us and then the last thing that we
 
00:37:52.829 --> 00:37:52.839 align:start position:0%
got for them was we they've given us
 
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
about 500 pages of emails you know
 
00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
because we had asked for communications
 
00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
and most of the emails um have to do
 
00:38:03.589 --> 00:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
with responding to reporters inquiries
 
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
largely about the pr because there was a
 
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
little bit of a Kur fuffle once word got
 
00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:09.560 align:start position:0%
out that they weren't um doing you know
 
00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
that they hadn't done these all the way
 
00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:13.160 align:start position:0%
through um and also responding to
 
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
Physicians with some concerns um there
 
00:38:17.349 --> 00:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
is you know there's a little bit of
 
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
other other you know other kinds of
 
00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
topics in the materials um but anything
 
00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:25.720 align:start position:0%
that could is remotely potentially of
 
00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:28.040 align:start position:0%
interest um is redacted such as a a
 
00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:30.040 align:start position:0%
discussion in I think it was in March or
 
00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
April of 2021 about PRS for myocarditis
 
00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
um April or May 2021 so so that was um
 
00:38:38.349 --> 00:38:38.359 align:start position:0%
so a lot of redactions there which we
 
00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
will litigate yeah representative belg
 
00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um just to make
 
00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
sure I understand the details of this a
 
00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
little bit because CDC was relying on
 
00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
they abandoned the pr in favor of EB at
 
00:38:54.309 --> 00:38:54.319 align:start position:0%
least initially for that period of time
 
00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:57.160 align:start position:0%
so when you say that there were numerous
 
00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
SA safety signals found in the current
 
00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
data from then that's safety signals
 
00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
arising from the EB method that they
 
00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:07.960 align:start position:0%
decided to use instead of
 
00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
PR um I'm I'm sorry I'm not following
 
00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:13.000 align:start position:0%
your question so uh I guess what I'm
 
00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
saying is so
 
00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:18.040 align:start position:0%
the the safety signals that they would
 
00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:20.680 align:start position:0%
have been aware of at that time time
 
00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
period you know 20121 2020 2021 that
 
00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
period of time um that was
 
00:39:30.069 --> 00:39:30.079 align:start position:0%
those signals were arising from the the
 
00:39:33.069 --> 00:39:33.079 align:start position:0%
basian method not from the pr method
 
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
because they weren't using that at the
 
00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
time yes that that would be my
 
00:39:37.589 --> 00:39:37.599 align:start position:0%
understanding I mean I don't have
 
00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
knowledge of that but that that's sort
 
00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
of the fair inference I would say
 
00:39:45.069 --> 00:39:45.079 align:start position:0%
yes so the record's yet to be produced
 
00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:49.240 align:start position:0%
from the CDC so we have yet to receive
 
00:39:51.829 --> 00:39:51.839 align:start position:0%
the discussions of the actual results of
 
00:39:55.309 --> 00:39:55.319 align:start position:0%
the pr and the EB Mining and we have yet
 
00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
to receive records of any investig ation
 
00:39:59.309 --> 00:39:59.319 align:start position:0%
they may have done of any safety signals
 
00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:00.640 align:start position:0%
and we know they were safety signals
 
00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
because we see it just in those few
 
00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
months of PR data but we haven't
 
00:40:05.589 --> 00:40:05.599 align:start position:0%
received any of those
 
00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:07.880 align:start position:0%
records something that is outstanding
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
that we know exists but we haven't
 
00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
received is there are 500 pages 512
 
00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
pages of emails between the CDC and the
 
00:40:18.069 --> 00:40:18.079 align:start position:0%
FDA that the CDC sent to the FDA for a
 
00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
consult in August of 2023 so just a
 
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
little over a year ago and apparently
 
00:40:26.109 --> 00:40:26.119 align:start position:0%
these include discussion of and possibly
 
00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
actually the EB mining records we're not
 
00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
sure about that so they were sent to the
 
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
FDA because you know if an if an agency
 
00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
is in has records in its custody but
 
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
those records were you know originated
 
00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:39.720 align:start position:0%
with another agency or are of great
 
00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
interest to another agency the agencies
 
00:40:44.309 --> 00:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
will consult so that so that the second
 
00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:46.280 align:start position:0%
agency has an opportunity to go through
 
00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
and decide if there's anything that they
 
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
would like redacted that the first
 
00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:51.400 align:start position:0%
agency hasn't already redacted that's
 
00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:53.240 align:start position:0%
basically the purpose of the consult is
 
00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
to look for additional Rea redactions
 
00:40:59.309 --> 00:40:59.319 align:start position:0%
and so these were sent um in in um in a
 
00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
little bit over a year ago um and um but
 
00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
what's happened since then is that um
 
00:41:10.589 --> 00:41:10.599 align:start position:0%
the CDC file in in March of 2024 filed a
 
00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:13.160 align:start position:0%
motion for a partial stay of proceedings
 
00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:15.720 align:start position:0%
um and and um I'll just read you the
 
00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
conclusion for from the memo the
 
00:41:20.309 --> 00:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
department requests that the court um
 
00:41:22.589 --> 00:41:22.599 align:start position:0%
Grant an 18month stay in this case with
 
00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
respect to any FDA processing of Records
 
00:41:28.589 --> 00:41:28.599 align:start position:0%
review and redaction um
 
00:41:32.349 --> 00:41:32.359 align:start position:0%
um and uh and and and also requested
 
00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:34.280 align:start position:0%
that the court um pull an order that it
 
00:41:37.109 --> 00:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
had issued in um February of this year
 
00:41:38.589 --> 00:41:38.599 align:start position:0%
that the that the CDC produced the
 
00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
records and the reason for this motion
 
00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:42.680 align:start position:0%
I'll get into a little bit more in a in
 
00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
a few minutes but basically it's because
 
00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:47.160 align:start position:0%
the FDA is very busy with the
 
00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
Productions of documents in the fiser
 
00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
and madna Licensing cases and so they um
 
00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:55.480 align:start position:0%
they they've said that they don't really
 
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
have the bandwidth to process other
 
00:41:59.589 --> 00:41:59.599 align:start position:0%
other requests um that are related to
 
00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
vaccines they didn't say related to
 
00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
vaccines but that's what the that's sort
 
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
of what the what the sum up is um so so
 
00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
that's where we are so the CDC case is
 
00:42:10.270 --> 00:42:10.280 align:start position:0%
stayed you see the information that we
 
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
have and also obviously the critical
 
00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
information that is still outstanding on
 
00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
this request that we filed two years
 
00:42:20.829 --> 00:42:20.839 align:start position:0%
ago so in terms of the FDA case um the
 
00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:22.760 align:start position:0%
the case seeking the v's monitoring
 
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
records in the spring of 2023 the FDA
 
00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:29.720 align:start position:0%
located 150 pages of records that were
 
00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
responsive to the um foyer requests that
 
00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:34.760 align:start position:0%
I can that attorney Siri had filed on
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
behalf of Ian and these 150 um records
 
00:42:42.109 --> 00:42:42.119 align:start position:0%
we think are consist of 75 Excel
 
00:42:45.069 --> 00:42:45.079 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets with the EB mining results
 
00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:47.960 align:start position:0%
and 75 cover emails transmittal emails
 
00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
for these records and so back in uh June
 
00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:54.040 align:start position:0%
of 2023 when we had to file a status
 
00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:55.720 align:start position:0%
report with the court just telling them
 
00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
sort of where things were in our case
 
00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
with the FDA the FDA told us that they
 
00:43:01.349 --> 00:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
had found these records and it was
 
00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
looking for other records and and that's
 
00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
sort of where things were so they've had
 
00:43:08.349 --> 00:43:08.359 align:start position:0%
these records for over a year and a half
 
00:43:11.109 --> 00:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
and so and it's only 150 pages and all
 
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
that's you really need to do to produce
 
00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
them if you think about it if they're
 
00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
repetitive records and they need to
 
00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:18.040 align:start position:0%
figure out what needs to be redacted
 
00:43:20.069 --> 00:43:20.079 align:start position:0%
they could look at the first spreadsheet
 
00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:21.880 align:start position:0%
and the first email decide what needs to
 
00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:23.240 align:start position:0%
be redacted if there's anything that
 
00:43:25.309 --> 00:43:25.319 align:start position:0%
falls into a Foy exemption and just
 
00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:27.400 align:start position:0%
apply that across the board and and and
 
00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:30.520 align:start position:0%
turn over the records but that's not
 
00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
what's happened um so in in both of our
 
00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
FDA cases last fall about a year ago the
 
00:43:40.990 --> 00:43:41.000 align:start position:0%
defendant the FDA filed a motion to stay
 
00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
the proceedings for 18 months um under a
 
00:43:46.829 --> 00:43:46.839 align:start position:0%
case called open America which I don't
 
00:43:48.309 --> 00:43:48.319 align:start position:0%
need to bore you with the details of
 
00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
that but basically if a if an agency can
 
00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
show that they're basically deluged with
 
00:43:55.230 --> 00:43:55.240 align:start position:0%
an unexpected volume of requests and
 
00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
they're diligently working to process
 
00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
your request then they're entitled to
 
00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
have the court extend the timeline for
 
00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
foyer production um but what this has
 
00:44:08.589 --> 00:44:08.599 align:start position:0%
turned into in in in our case against
 
00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:11.640 align:start position:0%
the FDA is is you know a a very very
 
00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
sort of long delay and so um so so the
 
00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
FDA argued last fall that you know
 
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
because of the production orders in the
 
00:44:22.349 --> 00:44:22.359 align:start position:0%
cases involving the fizer and Mna
 
00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
licensing documents which were orders of
 
00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
magnitude above any production orders
 
00:44:29.069 --> 00:44:29.079 align:start position:0%
that any Court I think has ever issued
 
00:44:31.349 --> 00:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
in a foyer case so to be fair they had
 
00:44:34.589 --> 00:44:34.599 align:start position:0%
to produce a lot a lot of Records um but
 
00:44:36.589 --> 00:44:36.599 align:start position:0%
because of that they said you know we're
 
00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
just we're way behind on our other
 
00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
requests and so we're not going to be
 
00:44:42.589 --> 00:44:42.599 align:start position:0%
able to help you for a while so we asked
 
00:44:45.790 --> 00:44:45.800 align:start position:0%
the court to stay things um so just just
 
00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
to point out that the licensing
 
00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
documents are required under the fda's
 
00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:51.880 align:start position:0%
own regulations to be made public as a
 
00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:53.640 align:start position:0%
as a matter of course upon request so
 
00:44:55.549 --> 00:44:55.559 align:start position:0%
it's not like these documents this was
 
00:44:57.549 --> 00:44:57.559 align:start position:0%
sort of unexpected that these documents
 
00:44:59.030 --> 00:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
had to be disclosed I mean it's right
 
00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
there in the fda's own
 
00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:04.200 align:start position:0%
regulations um
 
00:45:06.910 --> 00:45:06.920 align:start position:0%
so we've been sort of litigating back
 
00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:09.240 align:start position:0%
and forth with the FDA since they filed
 
00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:11.240 align:start position:0%
this and um and I just want to put to
 
00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
you that that what we've said to the
 
00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
court and I think is really true is that
 
00:45:17.109 --> 00:45:17.119 align:start position:0%
at this point the processing delay is
 
00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
really a problem of the fda's own making
 
00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:21.720 align:start position:0%
because theyve basically created a
 
00:45:25.829 --> 00:45:25.839 align:start position:0%
bottleneck by assigning zero foil
 
00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
workers to to be dedicated to working on
 
00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
requests related to vaccines um that are
 
00:45:35.309 --> 00:45:35.319 align:start position:0%
that are complex requests within cber
 
00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:36.640 align:start position:0%
and without getting into too much detail
 
00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:39.160 align:start position:0%
you know there the FDA has like seven I
 
00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
don't know how many different centers
 
00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
they have roughly seven I think and each
 
00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
one has its own foia processing office
 
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
and then within each office the requests
 
00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
get assigned to processing cues
 
00:45:51.069 --> 00:45:51.079 align:start position:0%
depending on what they're about and how
 
00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
complex they are and all of our requests
 
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
have somehow wound up in the complex
 
00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
queue which is for requests that they
 
00:45:59.870 --> 00:45:59.880 align:start position:0%
think will take 16 or more hours of work
 
00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
um but what we've learned through the
 
00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:02.680 align:start position:0%
litigation and the back and forth is
 
00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:04.720 align:start position:0%
that they don't have anybody dedicated
 
00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
to processing requests in that queue
 
00:46:09.109 --> 00:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
they've hired a lot of extra people to
 
00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:11.640 align:start position:0%
process the um the licensing documents
 
00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
in the phmp in the in the in the fiser
 
00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
and Mna licensing cases but no extra
 
00:46:20.069 --> 00:46:20.079 align:start position:0%
Personnel to work on requests in the
 
00:46:25.069 --> 00:46:25.079 align:start position:0%
queue that our requests are in yes so
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
explain to me as a lay person
 
00:46:29.829 --> 00:46:29.839 align:start position:0%
regarding licensing I mean what does
 
00:46:32.109 --> 00:46:32.119 align:start position:0%
that mean that they're trying to license
 
00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:35.960 align:start position:0%
these vaccines or yeah please okay I'm
 
00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:38.920 align:start position:0%
sorry so so after you know the the FDA
 
00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:41.720 align:start position:0%
issued emergency use authorizations for
 
00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
fizer Mna and whatever else um way back
 
00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:48.280 align:start position:0%
in December of 2020 emergency use
 
00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
authorizations are not full licenses
 
00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:53.000 align:start position:0%
it's a very different legal standard you
 
00:46:55.230 --> 00:46:55.240 align:start position:0%
all that has to happen is that the the
 
00:46:57.710 --> 00:46:57.720 align:start position:0%
FDA has to be satisfied the benefits
 
00:47:00.270 --> 00:47:00.280 align:start position:0%
outweigh the risks or the or the known
 
00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:01.880 align:start position:0%
and unknown benefits outweigh the known
 
00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
and unknown risks and that the product
 
00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:05.960 align:start position:0%
may be effective in doing whatever it is
 
00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:07.800 align:start position:0%
that it's supposed to do so it's the
 
00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:09.800 align:start position:0%
standard is very different um and it's
 
00:47:12.109 --> 00:47:12.119 align:start position:0%
just based on available evidence full
 
00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
licensure is what you know most of the
 
00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
drugs that is is when when you say a a
 
00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
product is FDA approved that means it's
 
00:47:22.349 --> 00:47:22.359 align:start position:0%
fully licensed and so the FDA and and
 
00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:24.280 align:start position:0%
that requires more documentation it's a
 
00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
different legal standard I'm far from E
 
00:47:28.069 --> 00:47:28.079 align:start position:0%
from an expert in sort of what all the
 
00:47:29.349 --> 00:47:29.359 align:start position:0%
differences are but it's obviously it's
 
00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:32.680 align:start position:0%
a more rigorous process and so these are
 
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
the documents they they gave full
 
00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:38.920 align:start position:0%
licensure to um fiser the cerity vaccine
 
00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:41.880 align:start position:0%
and then to Mna the spike vax and so
 
00:47:43.950 --> 00:47:43.960 align:start position:0%
these are the documents that that they
 
00:47:46.309 --> 00:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
reviewed before they licensed those
 
00:47:48.829 --> 00:47:48.839 align:start position:0%
vaccines so these are documents of lures
 
00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
that have already taken place um where
 
00:47:53.309 --> 00:47:53.319 align:start position:0%
again under the FDA regulations those
 
00:47:54.829 --> 00:47:54.839 align:start position:0%
sorts of documents are just supposed to
 
00:47:58.589 --> 00:47:58.599 align:start position:0%
be made available to public yeah um
 
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
so they're going through a licensing
 
00:48:02.910 --> 00:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
process for
 
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
these vaccines and is co the covid
 
00:48:08.270 --> 00:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
vaccine one of them that they're going
 
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
through a licensure for or there other
 
00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:13.400 align:start position:0%
uh shots or medic medications that
 
00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
they're going through the licensing
 
00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
process for that seems to be holding up
 
00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
the ball neck for fo you oh no no this
 
00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
is just so the only licensing documents
 
00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
that are that are sort of in at issue
 
00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
here are the ones for those two to the
 
00:48:30.030 --> 00:48:30.040 align:start position:0%
vaccines the the covid the the fiser and
 
00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
the madna um there there's not no it's
 
00:48:36.990 --> 00:48:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
so as far as I I mean that's all that
 
00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:41.000 align:start position:0%
theyve pointed to I should say right and
 
00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
but you said that anything regarding
 
00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
lure will be is is required by law to be
 
00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:48.680 align:start position:0%
on the website so anyone know no not on
 
00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
the website it's it's required to be
 
00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
disclosed they they maintain that it
 
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be disclosed until you
 
00:48:56.030 --> 00:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
get a foyer request but just that it is
 
00:48:57.990 --> 00:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
disclosable that those materials are
 
00:48:59.870 --> 00:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
disclosable I guess they you know they
 
00:49:01.589 --> 00:49:01.599 align:start position:0%
still get to go through and redact you
 
00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
know certain you know Trade Secrets
 
00:49:05.549 --> 00:49:05.559 align:start position:0%
financial information and things like
 
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
that so it's not that they do it and I'm
 
00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
sorry if I if I I created the wrong
 
00:49:12.109 --> 00:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
impression it doesn't happen
 
00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:14.680 align:start position:0%
automatically but it is required that it
 
00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
happen you know that that they be
 
00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
available for people so it's a little
 
00:49:19.109 --> 00:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
different from other records like the
 
00:49:20.309 --> 00:49:20.319 align:start position:0%
ones we're talking about where there's
 
00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
no law that requires them to make be
 
00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
made public separate and apart from the
 
00:49:27.069 --> 00:49:27.079 align:start position:0%
Freedom of Information Act
 
00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
so being a not someone involved with the
 
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
legal aspect of this or anything it
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
would seem to me that if you're going
 
00:49:41.069 --> 00:49:41.079 align:start position:0%
through a licensing process
 
00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
for uh uh vaccine that was an emergency
 
00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
you was used as an emergency use that
 
00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
your data should be fairly transparent
 
00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
and available to the public because
 
00:49:58.910 --> 00:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
obviously that information would be part
 
00:50:02.549 --> 00:50:02.559 align:start position:0%
of the licensing process um even though
 
00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
it was done under emergency use but it
 
00:50:09.150 --> 00:50:09.160 align:start position:0%
the records and the
 
00:50:13.390 --> 00:50:13.400 align:start position:0%
um results that that we are seeing these
 
00:50:15.630 --> 00:50:15.640 align:start position:0%
uh mining results and everything else
 
00:50:18.829 --> 00:50:18.839 align:start position:0%
should be readily available so I don't
 
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
understand why the
 
00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
bottleneck um I guess and why that
 
00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
information isn't getting out to the
 
00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
public um
 
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
so that's and you know the judge so
 
00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
these the the licensing cases were heard
 
00:50:36.190 --> 00:50:36.200 align:start position:0%
in Texas um I I referred to it the
 
00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:40.079 align:start position:0%
public health uh uh and medical
 
00:50:42.430 --> 00:50:42.440 align:start position:0%
providers for transparency phmp I don't
 
00:50:43.829 --> 00:50:43.839 align:start position:0%
remember the the name of the of the
 
00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
organization that filed suit but you
 
00:50:47.789 --> 00:50:47.799 align:start position:0%
know the judge in that case agreed that
 
00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
it was important to get these records
 
00:50:52.109 --> 00:50:52.119 align:start position:0%
out to the public quickly um and so
 
00:50:54.309 --> 00:50:54.319 align:start position:0%
that's part of why he ordered you know
 
00:50:56.190 --> 00:50:56.200 align:start position:0%
such a hefty production rate was because
 
00:50:57.349 --> 00:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
he thought that that they were it was
 
00:50:58.950 --> 00:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
important to get them out quickly but
 
00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
what's happened is that that has become
 
00:51:04.990 --> 00:51:05.000 align:start position:0%
you know the rationale for not providing
 
00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
any other information and you know what
 
00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
those records don't have in them is the
 
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
agency's own safety monitoring it has it
 
00:51:14.549 --> 00:51:14.559 align:start position:0%
has information that the manufacturers
 
00:51:15.829 --> 00:51:15.839 align:start position:0%
the companies have submitted but it
 
00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't have you know the you know the
 
00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:19.720 align:start position:0%
disinterested federal agencies
 
00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
monitoring of these of these um shots so
 
00:51:24.430 --> 00:51:24.440 align:start position:0%
it's really really different information
 
00:51:25.829 --> 00:51:25.839 align:start position:0%
that we're seeking from what's in the
 
00:51:27.309 --> 00:51:27.319 align:start position:0%
what's in the licensing documents
 
00:51:29.789 --> 00:51:29.799 align:start position:0%
represent beler thank you madam thank
 
00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and if I could I think
 
00:51:34.109 --> 00:51:34.119 align:start position:0%
just clarify for both everyone here as
 
00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
well asone watching so what we're
 
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
discussing is is a couple different
 
00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
things we had the the the lawsuits um
 
00:51:45.109 --> 00:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
not involving um anyone here today that
 
00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
we're looking at licensing data for
 
00:51:49.390 --> 00:51:49.400 align:start position:0%
these vaccines there was a fairly
 
00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
groundbreaking legal decision affecting
 
00:51:54.030 --> 00:51:54.040 align:start position:0%
a massive tranch of data that needed to
 
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
be produced which in turn tied up all of
 
00:51:59.230 --> 00:51:59.240 align:start position:0%
this agency's resources as far as
 
00:52:02.109 --> 00:52:02.119 align:start position:0%
releasing data they've taken on more
 
00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
people to accomplish that but they
 
00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
haven't taken on more people to
 
00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:08.680 align:start position:0%
accomplish the other
 
00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
um necessary data releases that are
 
00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
currently outstanding which is what
 
00:52:16.789 --> 00:52:16.799 align:start position:0%
we're what we're seeing here which is
 
00:52:19.150 --> 00:52:19.160 align:start position:0%
the bottleneck is effectively because
 
00:52:20.910 --> 00:52:20.920 align:start position:0%
all their resources are tied up by this
 
00:52:23.230 --> 00:52:23.240 align:start position:0%
Texas course Federal decision to release
 
00:52:25.150 --> 00:52:25.160 align:start position:0%
the licensing data they have not
 
00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:27.400 align:start position:0%
assigned any Personnel to to releasing
 
00:52:29.589 --> 00:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
this data nor taking on any new
 
00:52:32.309 --> 00:52:32.319 align:start position:0%
Personnel to accomplish that task yeah
 
00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
and let me just say so um you know they
 
00:52:36.789 --> 00:52:36.799 align:start position:0%
have I I think I just looked today you
 
00:52:37.870 --> 00:52:37.880 align:start position:0%
can go online and look at the different
 
00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
statistics they have in the entire FDA
 
00:52:43.470 --> 00:52:43.480 align:start position:0%
they have I think 169 full-time staff fo
 
00:52:46.349 --> 00:52:46.359 align:start position:0%
you and then another 10 on contract and
 
00:52:47.789 --> 00:52:47.799 align:start position:0%
you know they're just they're assigned
 
00:52:50.109 --> 00:52:50.119 align:start position:0%
to the different divisions and so in
 
00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
cber the um which is the you know the
 
00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
vaccine Licensing Division they have um
 
00:52:58.710 --> 00:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
I think I I I don't remember exactly how
 
00:53:00.349 --> 00:53:00.359 align:start position:0%
many people they have right now but I
 
00:53:02.309 --> 00:53:02.319 align:start position:0%
know that they're they're sort of
 
00:53:04.030 --> 00:53:04.040 align:start position:0%
reorganizing and they have 12 people
 
00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
working on the licensing documents five
 
00:53:08.829 --> 00:53:08.839 align:start position:0%
people working on everything else and
 
00:53:11.109 --> 00:53:11.119 align:start position:0%
they have six processing cues but you
 
00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
know SE last fall I think 70% of their
 
00:53:16.109 --> 00:53:16.119 align:start position:0%
requests were in the complex queue and
 
00:53:18.069 --> 00:53:18.079 align:start position:0%
there was nobody dedicated to processing
 
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
requests in that queue so they really
 
00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
and you know and they have 169 foyer
 
00:53:25.109 --> 00:53:25.119 align:start position:0%
Personnel they hired contractors to do
 
00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:27.400 align:start position:0%
the licensing documents know like that
 
00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:28.720 align:start position:0%
because they had to because of the court
 
00:53:31.349 --> 00:53:31.359 align:start position:0%
order um so you know there are ways to
 
00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
to deal with this and this has been
 
00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
going on for over two years the first
 
00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
licensing the first document production
 
00:53:39.150 --> 00:53:39.160 align:start position:0%
order came down from Texas in I think it
 
00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:41.640 align:start position:0%
was January of 2022 so there has been
 
00:53:44.109 --> 00:53:44.119 align:start position:0%
plenty of time to sort of adjust to this
 
00:53:46.589 --> 00:53:46.599 align:start position:0%
situation um but what's happened is just
 
00:53:48.829 --> 00:53:48.839 align:start position:0%
the backlog has increased in the in the
 
00:53:51.309 --> 00:53:51.319 align:start position:0%
complex processing track within within
 
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
seber um and so now what they've said so
 
00:53:57.589 --> 00:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
we we did get a judge um this summer was
 
00:53:59.390 --> 00:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
be beginning to get concerned about the
 
00:54:01.829 --> 00:54:01.839 align:start position:0%
situation and asked some tough questions
 
00:54:04.030 --> 00:54:04.040 align:start position:0%
of the FDA including you know when do
 
00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
you expect to start processing um this
 
00:54:09.150 --> 00:54:09.160 align:start position:0%
foyer request for the vs data you know
 
00:54:10.589 --> 00:54:10.599 align:start position:0%
in the absence of a court order
 
00:54:11.789 --> 00:54:11.799 align:start position:0%
obviously if they get a court order
 
00:54:13.150 --> 00:54:13.160 align:start position:0%
they're going to start processing right
 
00:54:15.549 --> 00:54:15.559 align:start position:0%
away and they said we estimate that
 
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
we'll begin processing this foyer
 
00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
request when it reaches the front of the
 
00:54:22.549 --> 00:54:22.559 align:start position:0%
complex track in a proximately 24 to 36
 
00:54:25.549 --> 00:54:25.559 align:start position:0%
months and this was in August of 2024
 
00:54:27.069 --> 00:54:27.079 align:start position:0%
which would make it five years from the
 
00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
time that we requested the data that
 
00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
that the FDA would start processing the
 
00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:33.750 align:start position:0%
that the FDA would start processing the
request

00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
request
 
00:54:36.349 --> 00:54:36.359 align:start position:0%
um so that's where we are with the FDA
 
00:54:38.549 --> 00:54:38.559 align:start position:0%
so those cases are stayed um we have a
 
00:54:40.510 --> 00:54:40.520 align:start position:0%
we have a hearing in this case in the in
 
00:54:43.069 --> 00:54:43.079 align:start position:0%
the vars case uh in October in early
 
00:54:44.309 --> 00:54:44.319 align:start position:0%
October I don't remember the date and
 
00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
then we have one in the other case um in
 
00:54:50.549 --> 00:54:50.559 align:start position:0%
uh I think we have a status report due
 
00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
in the active monitoring case in
 
00:54:54.549 --> 00:54:54.559 align:start position:0%
December and a hearing in the CDC case
 
00:54:56.430 --> 00:54:56.440 align:start position:0%
in January so you know we have stuff
 
00:54:58.829 --> 00:54:58.839 align:start position:0%
coming up and we we keep you know we'll
 
00:55:00.430 --> 00:55:00.440 align:start position:0%
keep trying to impress on the court that
 
00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
you know at a certain point it's
 
00:55:04.030 --> 00:55:04.040 align:start position:0%
understandable you know when the FDA
 
00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
first got slammed with these orders that
 
00:55:07.789 --> 00:55:07.799 align:start position:0%
it took them a little while to figure
 
00:55:10.030 --> 00:55:10.040 align:start position:0%
out how to respond but you know at this
 
00:55:12.349 --> 00:55:12.359 align:start position:0%
point this information needs to be
 
00:55:14.109 --> 00:55:14.119 align:start position:0%
public the information that we're asking
 
00:55:15.870 --> 00:55:15.880 align:start position:0%
for and so they need to figure out a way
 
00:55:18.309 --> 00:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
to process these requests um and I just
 
00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:19.720 align:start position:0%
want to point to before I move on to the
 
00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
NIH this is what I I have a slide here
 
00:55:23.349 --> 00:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
and there's a link to this earlier in
 
00:55:25.630 --> 00:55:25.640 align:start position:0%
the presentation the testimony of Peter
 
00:55:28.990 --> 00:55:29.000 align:start position:0%
marks um Dr Peter Marx who's the C the
 
00:55:33.029 --> 00:55:33.039 align:start position:0%
the the um director of seber um and he
 
00:55:35.630 --> 00:55:35.640 align:start position:0%
testified before the Senate subcommittee
 
00:55:39.589 --> 00:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
on Corona um in February of 2024 and he
 
00:55:41.430 --> 00:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
said you know the American public can be
 
00:55:43.630 --> 00:55:43.640 align:start position:0%
assured of the simple fact that the FDA
 
00:55:45.549 --> 00:55:45.559 align:start position:0%
approved and authorized vaccines are
 
00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:48.760 align:start position:0%
safe um the vaccine safety is closely
 
00:55:50.910 --> 00:55:50.920 align:start position:0%
and continuously monitored through
 
00:55:53.069 --> 00:55:53.079 align:start position:0%
multiple surveillance systems which
 
00:55:55.870 --> 00:55:55.880 align:start position:0%
alert the FDA and the CDC should have
 
00:55:58.789 --> 00:55:58.799 align:start position:0%
concerned and arise and he cites to the
 
00:56:01.069 --> 00:56:01.079 align:start position:0%
two um systems that we've been asking
 
00:56:04.029 --> 00:56:04.039 align:start position:0%
for records from the passive ver system
 
00:56:06.430 --> 00:56:06.440 align:start position:0%
and the act of surveillance so they're
 
00:56:08.349 --> 00:56:08.359 align:start position:0%
using this information to make
 
00:56:10.789 --> 00:56:10.799 align:start position:0%
statements which is fine but we should
 
00:56:12.549 --> 00:56:12.559 align:start position:0%
you know we should see it so it's just
 
00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
really striking to me that they're you
 
00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
know willing to rely on this information
 
00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
and public statements but we haven't
 
00:56:22.270 --> 00:56:22.280 align:start position:0%
been given this data so for the NIH um
 
00:56:24.109 --> 00:56:24.119 align:start position:0%
initially what happened when we filed
 
00:56:25.630 --> 00:56:25.640 align:start position:0%
our complaint to get the records of
 
00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:26.750 align:start position:0%
our complaint to get the records of
communication

00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
communication
 
00:56:28.670 --> 00:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
um from the NIH is that they did
 
00:56:30.390 --> 00:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
something which hasn't happened I mean I
 
00:56:32.270 --> 00:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
haven't done a lot of these cases but it
 
00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
struck me as unusual they filed a motion
 
00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
to dismiss the complaint and what they
 
00:56:37.789 --> 00:56:37.799 align:start position:0%
said in the motion to dismiss was that
 
00:56:39.750 --> 00:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
we hadn't actually submitted a properly
 
00:56:42.910 --> 00:56:42.920 align:start position:0%
formulated request um and this was just
 
00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
completely not true because we our our
 
00:56:48.150 --> 00:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
request had been over broad they told us
 
00:56:50.109 --> 00:56:50.119 align:start position:0%
it was over broad we refined it we
 
00:56:52.069 --> 00:56:52.079 align:start position:0%
communicated back and forth I said is
 
00:56:53.549 --> 00:56:53.559 align:start position:0%
this fine do you have everything you
 
00:56:57.230 --> 00:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
need yes we're fine at no point after
 
00:56:59.190 --> 00:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
multiple Communications that they that
 
00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:00.640 align:start position:0%
they tell us that they didn't have what
 
00:57:02.789 --> 00:57:02.799 align:start position:0%
they need to needed to process the
 
00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
requests because you know for so so um
 
00:57:08.190 --> 00:57:08.200 align:start position:0%
so we were a little bit you know
 
00:57:10.430 --> 00:57:10.440 align:start position:0%
surprised to see this but we objected we
 
00:57:12.510 --> 00:57:12.520 align:start position:0%
filed an objection and and you know
 
00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
these pleadings take a lot of hours and
 
00:57:16.109 --> 00:57:16.119 align:start position:0%
I should say that the fda's pleadings
 
00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:17.640 align:start position:0%
you know seeking the stays I have to say
 
00:57:19.069 --> 00:57:19.079 align:start position:0%
if you put together the amount of time
 
00:57:20.510 --> 00:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
that must have been involved in putting
 
00:57:22.349 --> 00:57:22.359 align:start position:0%
together those pleadings it's a lot more
 
00:57:23.829 --> 00:57:23.839 align:start position:0%
than it would have taken to process the
 
00:57:26.270 --> 00:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
EB mine mining records and just turn
 
00:57:27.309 --> 00:57:27.319 align:start position:0%
them over to all the people who are
 
00:57:29.870 --> 00:57:29.880 align:start position:0%
interested in them but um so anyway we
 
00:57:31.710 --> 00:57:31.720 align:start position:0%
objected to the motion to dismiss and
 
00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:34.240 align:start position:0%
the and the um NIH did something which
 
00:57:35.710 --> 00:57:35.720 align:start position:0%
is pretty rare I think is that they
 
00:57:37.870 --> 00:57:37.880 align:start position:0%
withdrew the object they withdrew their
 
00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
motion they said you know CHD is right
 
00:57:42.910 --> 00:57:42.920 align:start position:0%
there's no basis for dismissal and so
 
00:57:44.510 --> 00:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
now we'll answer the complaint and so
 
00:57:46.029 --> 00:57:46.039 align:start position:0%
they went on to answer the complaint but
 
00:57:47.829 --> 00:57:47.839 align:start position:0%
this sort of delayed things another
 
00:57:49.150 --> 00:57:49.160 align:start position:0%
couple of months while we went through
 
00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:53.880 align:start position:0%
this litigation um so the NIH has since
 
00:57:57.510 --> 00:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
then um located about 7500 pages of
 
00:57:59.829 --> 00:57:59.839 align:start position:0%
emails initially they told us that they
 
00:58:01.510 --> 00:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
weren't going to produce any of them
 
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
because of privacy concerns and we said
 
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
well you could just redact all the
 
00:58:07.349 --> 00:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
personal identifying information we have
 
00:58:10.190 --> 00:58:10.200 align:start position:0%
no interest in knowing anybody's names
 
00:58:12.150 --> 00:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
personally we just want to know what are
 
00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
they talking about and so they agreed to
 
00:58:16.349 --> 00:58:16.359 align:start position:0%
do that and so they now since I think
 
00:58:18.710 --> 00:58:18.720 align:start position:0%
January have been producing the records
 
00:58:21.390 --> 00:58:21.400 align:start position:0%
on a rolling basis of about 300 pages
 
00:58:24.309 --> 00:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
per month and um I have in the
 
00:58:25.789 --> 00:58:25.799 align:start position:0%
PowerPoint some links to different
 
00:58:28.230 --> 00:58:28.240 align:start position:0%
articles articles um that that CHD has
 
00:58:31.309 --> 00:58:31.319 align:start position:0%
put out um about about these records but
 
00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
they really they paint a very sad
 
00:58:35.950 --> 00:58:35.960 align:start position:0%
picture um and I just want to uh comment
 
00:58:37.390 --> 00:58:37.400 align:start position:0%
on a couple of things that we've seen
 
00:58:39.470 --> 00:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
from the records you know number one is
 
00:58:41.430 --> 00:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of people were reaching out in
 
00:58:44.029 --> 00:58:44.039 align:start position:0%
real desperation because they suffered
 
00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
some very severe effects within hours or
 
00:58:49.710 --> 00:58:49.720 align:start position:0%
days of receiving shots and you know
 
00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
their doctors didn't know what to do
 
00:58:53.950 --> 00:58:53.960 align:start position:0%
people no nobody knew what to do and
 
00:58:57.029 --> 00:58:57.039 align:start position:0%
they really really wanted help the NIH
 
00:58:58.950 --> 00:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
researchers who responded to them were
 
00:59:00.630 --> 00:59:00.640 align:start position:0%
very very sympathetic and I think that
 
00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
they really wanted to help and I just
 
00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:04.640 align:start position:0%
want to be clear no no criticism of them
 
00:59:07.390 --> 00:59:07.400 align:start position:0%
here um they brought some people to DC
 
00:59:09.990 --> 00:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
to study them like I said um and they
 
00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
they also had several other studies in
 
00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
the works there are Communications about
 
00:59:15.309 --> 00:59:15.319 align:start position:0%
those but for some reason those studies
 
00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
never took place another thing that's
 
00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
interesting is that some of the emails
 
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
that um were sent to NIH the NIH were
 
00:59:25.589 --> 00:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
forwarded to people like Anthony fouchy
 
00:59:28.710 --> 00:59:28.720 align:start position:0%
Peter Mar s so these these reports of
 
00:59:30.589 --> 00:59:30.599 align:start position:0%
injuries these really devastating
 
00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
reports you know firsthand accounts from
 
00:59:35.309 --> 00:59:35.319 align:start position:0%
people um were shared you know with with
 
00:59:37.710 --> 00:59:37.720 align:start position:0%
the top brass within um within
 
00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
HHS um and so I have here this this page
 
00:59:43.349 --> 00:59:43.359 align:start position:0%
has some just little excerpts from the
 
00:59:45.270 --> 00:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
records but you can you know you can
 
00:59:47.109 --> 00:59:47.119 align:start position:0%
read all of them they're Linked In The
 
00:59:50.430 --> 00:59:50.440 align:start position:0%
Articles um and uh this last email is
 
00:59:52.870 --> 00:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
from Peter Marx responding to somebody
 
00:59:55.109 --> 00:59:55.119 align:start position:0%
about adverse neurological reactions to
 
00:59:57.589 --> 00:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
co mRNA vac vaccines that was forwarded
 
00:59:59.829 --> 00:59:59.839 align:start position:0%
from mih and he said I'm so sorry to
 
01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
hear of your symptoms we take all
 
01:00:03.670 --> 01:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
adverse event reports seriously I've
 
01:00:05.309 --> 01:00:05.319 align:start position:0%
asked our pharmacovigilance team to
 
01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
follow up with you and we certainly hope
 
01:00:09.430 --> 01:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
that you feel better soon thanks to our
 
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
NIH colleagues for forwarding your
 
01:00:14.190 --> 01:00:14.200 align:start position:0%
message so you know these these reports
 
01:00:15.910 --> 01:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
and again this is anecdotal data right
 
01:00:18.109 --> 01:00:18.119 align:start position:0%
it's not statistical but it's very you
 
01:00:20.829 --> 01:00:20.839 align:start position:0%
know very compelling really and from a
 
01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:22.720 align:start position:0%
lot of people and a lot and the people
 
01:00:25.109 --> 01:00:25.119 align:start position:0%
who contacted Niah and number them when
 
01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
they contacted n you know said there I'm
 
01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:29.720 align:start position:0%
in a group with like you know 10 other
 
01:00:31.470 --> 01:00:31.480 align:start position:0%
people like me 20 other people like me
 
01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
so so you know they were not unique in
 
01:00:37.230 --> 01:00:37.240 align:start position:0%
their suffering represent pitz uh could
 
01:00:41.230 --> 01:00:41.240 align:start position:0%
you confirm that uh uh Dr Marx who who
 
01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:42.270 align:start position:0%
you confirm that uh uh Dr Marx who who
was

01:00:42.270 --> 01:00:42.280 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:00:45.029 --> 01:00:45.039 align:start position:0%
replying uh about this side effects is
 
01:00:47.549 --> 01:00:47.559 align:start position:0%
the same person who still saying that
 
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
vaccines are safe and
 
01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:52.200 align:start position:0%
effective I I assume so I mean I you
 
01:00:55.109 --> 01:00:55.119 align:start position:0%
know I that that yeah looking at this I
 
01:00:59.430 --> 01:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:04.150 --> 01:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
yes um so so that's all I have um and I
 
01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
just I'm happy you you've been asking
 
01:01:06.990 --> 01:01:07.000 align:start position:0%
questions all the way through but if
 
01:01:08.349 --> 01:01:08.359 align:start position:0%
there are any other questions I'm happy
 
01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
them represent PA
 
01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
off uh thank you it's uh very uh helpful
 
01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:20.430 align:start position:0%
off uh thank you it's uh very uh helpful
and

01:01:20.430 --> 01:01:20.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
insightful and uh I
 
01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
wonder uh probably it's more for us but
 
01:01:29.950 --> 01:01:29.960 align:start position:0%
uh to determine but if you have any
 
01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
ideas how can we help how New Hampshire
 
01:01:37.150 --> 01:01:37.160 align:start position:0%
legislature can do if anything and
 
01:01:39.109 --> 01:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
second part of
 
01:01:42.150 --> 01:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
question um our governor claimed that
 
01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
he's considering joining other Governors
 
01:01:48.190 --> 01:01:48.200 align:start position:0%
to push manufacturers to release some
 
01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
safety data around covid vaccines and
 
01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:54.520 align:start position:0%
also New Hampshire attorney general he
 
01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
claims that his office was fighting uh
 
01:02:01.630 --> 01:02:01.640 align:start position:0%
against uh vaccine mandates so
 
01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
maybe they sometime helpful so is there
 
01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
anything um governance office or new
 
01:02:13.269 --> 01:02:13.279 align:start position:0%
attorney general can help with
 
01:02:17.589 --> 01:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
relasing important safety data um wow
 
01:02:19.870 --> 01:02:19.880 align:start position:0%
that's a great question um I mean I
 
01:02:21.910 --> 01:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
think maybe you know letting the
 
01:02:24.269 --> 01:02:24.279 align:start position:0%
agencies know that that you want this
 
01:02:27.309 --> 01:02:27.319 align:start position:0%
data um I will say this that you know
 
01:02:30.990 --> 01:02:31.000 align:start position:0%
Senator Ron Johnson's office um asked
 
01:02:33.589 --> 01:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
the CDC for the pr data and asked the
 
01:02:36.190 --> 01:02:36.200 align:start position:0%
FDA for the EB mining data and I think
 
01:02:38.309 --> 01:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
eventually he got this PR data but what
 
01:02:40.349 --> 01:02:40.359 align:start position:0%
the FDA said to him about the EB mining
 
01:02:42.910 --> 01:02:42.920 align:start position:0%
data was that they couldn't turn it over
 
01:02:44.430 --> 01:02:44.440 align:start position:0%
to him because it was the subject of
 
01:02:47.309 --> 01:02:47.319 align:start position:0%
litigation so um so that's what happened
 
01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
when a when a senator asked for the data
 
01:02:52.829 --> 01:02:52.839 align:start position:0%
so um you know I I I do think it's you
 
01:02:52.839 --> 01:02:54.390 align:start position:0%
so um you know I I I do think it's you
know

01:02:54.390 --> 01:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:02:56.549 --> 01:02:56.559 align:start position:0%
uh I I have to think about that some
 
01:02:59.670 --> 01:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
more but but I think just you know um
 
01:03:02.230 --> 01:03:02.240 align:start position:0%
insisting on transparency perhaps and
 
01:03:04.430 --> 01:03:04.440 align:start position:0%
when when you know when safety claims
 
01:03:07.309 --> 01:03:07.319 align:start position:0%
are made um perhaps you know responding
 
01:03:09.390 --> 01:03:09.400 align:start position:0%
with a request for the underlying data
 
01:03:12.269 --> 01:03:12.279 align:start position:0%
certainly um and and you know in the
 
01:03:13.829 --> 01:03:13.839 align:start position:0%
course of Correspondence I mean I don't
 
01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:15.240 align:start position:0%
I don't know about what sorts of
 
01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
communications the New Hampshire
 
01:03:17.710 --> 01:03:17.720 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:03:19.710 --> 01:03:19.720 align:start position:0%
has with the you know with with the
 
01:03:21.789 --> 01:03:21.799 align:start position:0%
different agencies but but certainly in
 
01:03:24.269 --> 01:03:24.279 align:start position:0%
those Communications you know saying we
 
01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
we would really like to see the data you
 
01:03:28.750 --> 01:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
know not that we don't trust I mean it's
 
01:03:30.589 --> 01:03:30.599 align:start position:0%
it certainly it reinforces trust when
 
01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
you see the data right so so it can only
 
01:03:35.470 --> 01:03:35.480 align:start position:0%
benefit everybody if if the data are you
 
01:03:36.990 --> 01:03:37.000 align:start position:0%
know if there's transparency around the
 
01:03:39.069 --> 01:03:39.079 align:start position:0%
data um and you know maybe New
 
01:03:40.589 --> 01:03:40.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Federal delegation could
 
01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:43.079 align:start position:0%
sponsor some sort of federal data you
 
01:03:45.549 --> 01:03:45.559 align:start position:0%
know data disclosure kind of Statute I
 
01:03:47.109 --> 01:03:47.119 align:start position:0%
think again that would be that would
 
01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
benefit not just people in New Hampshire
 
01:03:51.109 --> 01:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
but obviously across the
 
01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
country representative
 
01:03:56.190 --> 01:03:56.200 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:03:58.029 --> 01:03:58.039 align:start position:0%
again for being here for all this I'd
 
01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
like to ask a few questions that I have
 
01:04:05.230 --> 01:04:05.240 align:start position:0%
um first starting off with uh seeing if
 
01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:07.720 align:start position:0%
we can get cooperating information for
 
01:04:10.190 --> 01:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
previous testimony we've received or
 
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
anything further on it are you familiar
 
01:04:14.950 --> 01:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
with or do you have any information on
 
01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:20.200 align:start position:0%
the monitoring program V dare no okay so
 
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
that was a program that we received
 
01:04:24.349 --> 01:04:24.359 align:start position:0%
testimony on by uh Aaron Siri a a
 
01:04:26.670 --> 01:04:26.680 align:start position:0%
program that was set up to
 
01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh collect voluntary data from people
 
01:04:32.910 --> 01:04:32.920 align:start position:0%
before they ever received the vaccine to
 
01:04:35.589 --> 01:04:35.599 align:start position:0%
report thereafter on their experience
 
01:04:38.109 --> 01:04:38.119 align:start position:0%
with the vaccine um my understanding is
 
01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
this is a fairly robust database that
 
01:04:42.670 --> 01:04:42.680 align:start position:0%
does exist but to date nobody has been
 
01:04:45.630 --> 01:04:45.640 align:start position:0%
able to get their hands on any of the
 
01:04:48.549 --> 01:04:48.559 align:start position:0%
data from this database so it's Vare
 
01:04:52.750 --> 01:04:52.760 align:start position:0%
okay if I may uh next question is going
 
01:04:57.750 --> 01:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:01.109 --> 01:05:01.119 align:start position:0%
do you have any information um or
 
01:05:05.910 --> 01:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
knowledge about the fairly recent event
 
01:05:08.710 --> 01:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
where I believe it was the
 
01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
DHHS Federal
 
01:05:15.269 --> 01:05:15.279 align:start position:0%
DHHS has blacklisted and prohibited the
 
01:05:17.829 --> 01:05:17.839 align:start position:0%
organization Eco Health Alliance and the
 
01:05:21.109 --> 01:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
founder Peter daik of any sort of
 
01:05:23.309 --> 01:05:23.319 align:start position:0%
further money receipt from the United
 
01:05:25.829 --> 01:05:25.839 align:start position:0%
States government based on their
 
01:05:28.029 --> 01:05:28.039 align:start position:0%
stonewalling of an investigation into
 
01:05:30.349 --> 01:05:30.359 align:start position:0%
the origins of covid for which they
 
01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
apparently had substantial amounts of
 
01:05:34.589 --> 01:05:34.599 align:start position:0%
data that they
 
01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
withheld I don't know if you have I
 
01:05:38.029 --> 01:05:38.039 align:start position:0%
think you know more about it than I do
 
01:05:38.039 --> 01:05:39.269 align:start position:0%
think you know more about it than I do
fair

01:05:39.269 --> 01:05:39.279 align:start position:0%
fair
 
01:05:42.990 --> 01:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
enough um let's see
 
01:05:46.670 --> 01:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
here um okay so the last question that I
 
01:05:48.910 --> 01:05:48.920 align:start position:0%
would have is really more a little bit
 
01:05:51.789 --> 01:05:51.799 align:start position:0%
more open-ended and I'll I'll I'll
 
01:05:53.549 --> 01:05:53.559 align:start position:0%
introduce it with this are you familiar
 
01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
with any um
 
01:05:57.910 --> 01:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
any Communications internal
 
01:06:00.750 --> 01:06:00.760 align:start position:0%
Communications within any agencies be it
 
01:06:04.190 --> 01:06:04.200 align:start position:0%
state or federal that would indicate
 
01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:07.039 align:start position:0%
that um the manipulation of public
 
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
opinion or uptake of vaccines may have
 
01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
played a role in what they were choosing
 
01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
to disclose or not disclose at any point
 
01:06:19.109 --> 01:06:19.119 align:start position:0%
in time well that's a big
 
01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
question I
 
01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
mean you know there it's obvious that
 
01:06:29.190 --> 01:06:29.200 align:start position:0%
that during Co there was a lot of money
 
01:06:32.670 --> 01:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
spent to influence public
 
01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
opinion so I'm not sure if that's what
 
01:06:36.029 --> 01:06:36.039 align:start position:0%
you're talking about but there were
 
01:06:38.269 --> 01:06:38.279 align:start position:0%
millions and millions and millions of
 
01:06:40.589 --> 01:06:40.599 align:start position:0%
dollars spent on grants to various
 
01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
Community organizations media
 
01:06:46.710 --> 01:06:46.720 align:start position:0%
organizations you know to promote
 
01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
vaccination um trusted uh I forget what
 
01:06:52.789 --> 01:06:52.799 align:start position:0%
they call trusted voices I mean so so
 
01:06:53.870 --> 01:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
not sure if that's what you're talking
 
01:06:56.309 --> 01:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
about thank you yes so that that that
 
01:06:57.710 --> 01:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
has a lot to do with what I'm talking
 
01:06:59.549 --> 01:06:59.559 align:start position:0%
about we we do have if I'm not mistaken
 
01:07:01.109 --> 01:07:01.119 align:start position:0%
in our permanent record because I
 
01:07:03.150 --> 01:07:03.160 align:start position:0%
believe I've previously read it in
 
01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
internal emails from I believe it was
 
01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:06.710 align:start position:0%
internal emails from I believe it was
the

01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:07:08.710 --> 01:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
FDA um
 
01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
discussing um that there were signals or
 
01:07:14.950 --> 01:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
other data coming to light that they
 
01:07:17.470 --> 01:07:17.480 align:start position:0%
were concerned would reduce vaccine
 
01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
uptake if it got out and suggesting that
 
01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
this might be playing into their
 
01:07:23.829 --> 01:07:23.839 align:start position:0%
deliberations which is something that
 
01:07:26.589 --> 01:07:26.599 align:start position:0%
youve brought up this exemption um for
 
01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
deliberative process which that walks me
 
01:07:32.190 --> 01:07:32.200 align:start position:0%
into my bigger question here which is
 
01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
have you or your organization uh taking
 
01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
in into consideration the broad effects
 
01:07:40.309 --> 01:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
of What's called the Smith month
 
01:07:42.589 --> 01:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
modernization Act of 2012 and how it
 
01:07:45.309 --> 01:07:45.319 align:start position:0%
plays into any of this you know I'm
 
01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
familiar with that act I can't say that
 
01:07:49.470 --> 01:07:49.480 align:start position:0%
that has played a role in the work that
 
01:07:51.870 --> 01:07:51.880 align:start position:0%
that I'm doing but but you know I mean I
 
01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
think it probably that what I was just
 
01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
referring to in terms of the millions
 
01:07:56.390 --> 01:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
and millions of I mean those are all
 
01:07:58.630 --> 01:07:58.640 align:start position:0%
contracts and grants which you can see
 
01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
in the federal database um you know
 
01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
including um you know situations where
 
01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
like there's ghost writers for the CDC
 
01:08:10.230 --> 01:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
who are putting materials in newspapers
 
01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
or you know Publications where it's not
 
01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
you know the source of the materials is
 
01:08:17.709 --> 01:08:17.719 align:start position:0%
on you know is is not is not revealed so
 
01:08:19.789 --> 01:08:19.799 align:start position:0%
I mean I that that does play into it
 
01:08:22.510 --> 01:08:22.520 align:start position:0%
thank you and if I may just help to
 
01:08:26.430 --> 01:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
explain what I'm getting at here is that
 
01:08:31.470 --> 01:08:31.480 align:start position:0%
um for most of American History
 
01:08:34.789 --> 01:08:34.799 align:start position:0%
the the determination and discernment of
 
01:08:37.749 --> 01:08:37.759 align:start position:0%
Truth was not generally considered to be
 
01:08:40.470 --> 01:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
a proper government function that was
 
01:08:42.789 --> 01:08:42.799 align:start position:0%
something delegated to the people or
 
01:08:45.229 --> 01:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
reserved to the people even within our
 
01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
Judiciary System when there's a fact
 
01:08:48.870 --> 01:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
finding happening it's usually being
 
01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
done by a jury of somebody's peers
 
01:08:53.590 --> 01:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
because it's it's a function reserved to
 
01:08:57.630 --> 01:08:57.640 align:start position:0%
the people um in law since 1948
 
01:09:00.669 --> 01:09:00.679 align:start position:0%
officially there was the Smith Mont act
 
01:09:04.749 --> 01:09:04.759 align:start position:0%
which officially by law prohibited the
 
01:09:07.470 --> 01:09:07.480 align:start position:0%
propagandizing of the American people by
 
01:09:10.149 --> 01:09:10.159 align:start position:0%
the American government which is another
 
01:09:11.709 --> 01:09:11.719 align:start position:0%
way of saying that the government is not
 
01:09:13.269 --> 01:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
allowed to establish its own opinion
 
01:09:14.829 --> 01:09:14.839 align:start position:0%
about what truth is and then try to
 
01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
enforce that on the American public um
 
01:09:21.990 --> 01:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately in my opinion uh the Smith
 
01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
month modernization Act of 2012 under
 
01:09:26.269 --> 01:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
President Obama
 
01:09:29.229 --> 01:09:29.239 align:start position:0%
actually repealed those prohibitions on
 
01:09:31.789 --> 01:09:31.799 align:start position:0%
propagandizing the American people
 
01:09:35.110 --> 01:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
making it legal to use federal
 
01:09:37.789 --> 01:09:37.799 align:start position:0%
government resources to establish an
 
01:09:39.789 --> 01:09:39.799 align:start position:0%
official Narrative of government what
 
01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
truth is to try to inforce on the
 
01:09:44.110 --> 01:09:44.120 align:start position:0%
American people and the reason I think
 
01:09:45.669 --> 01:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
that there's a direct connection between
 
01:09:48.149 --> 01:09:48.159 align:start position:0%
this and what we're discussing today is
 
01:09:51.550 --> 01:09:51.560 align:start position:0%
is broadly speaking if the government
 
01:09:55.390 --> 01:09:55.400 align:start position:0%
since this act in 2012 now has the power
 
01:09:57.270 --> 01:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
to establish
 
01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
truth and and propagandize the American
 
01:10:03.149 --> 01:10:03.159 align:start position:0%
people then all of a sudden this
 
01:10:06.550 --> 01:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
deliberative process in theory can
 
01:10:08.590 --> 01:10:08.600 align:start position:0%
lawfully take into consideration the
 
01:10:11.390 --> 01:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
manipulation of public opinion to match
 
01:10:13.149 --> 01:10:13.159 align:start position:0%
what the government wants the public to
 
01:10:15.510 --> 01:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
believe as a legitimate function of
 
01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
government thereby withhold that
 
01:10:21.550 --> 01:10:21.560 align:start position:0%
information as deliberative process does
 
01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
that make sense yeah I I I guess I would
 
01:10:26.189 --> 01:10:26.199 align:start position:0%
respond by saying saying I think that
 
01:10:28.030 --> 01:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
you know you don't need Communications
 
01:10:30.189 --> 01:10:30.199 align:start position:0%
within the agency to show that these
 
01:10:32.590 --> 01:10:32.600 align:start position:0%
things are happening we have all these
 
01:10:33.990 --> 01:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
federal grants which are very
 
01:10:35.669 --> 01:10:35.679 align:start position:0%
transparent about what they're doing
 
01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
that they're trying to influence public
 
01:10:40.110 --> 01:10:40.120 align:start position:0%
opinion to increase vaccine uptake very
 
01:10:41.790 --> 01:10:41.800 align:start position:0%
very transparent it says that right
 
01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
there in the document so there's no
 
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
disputing that the other thing is we
 
01:10:47.709 --> 01:10:47.719 align:start position:0%
have you know the um the censorship
 
01:10:49.990 --> 01:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
cases so Kennedy versus Biden which is
 
01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
still alive and well um you know where
 
01:10:54.790 --> 01:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
where the judge found you know lots of
 
01:10:56.350 --> 01:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
competent evidence that the federal
 
01:10:58.229 --> 01:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
agencies were censoring views that
 
01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
conflicted with the you know with with
 
01:11:03.910 --> 01:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
with the narrative so we have and we
 
01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
have secrecy I mean you really we have
 
01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
even without without any Communications
 
01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
between you know Federal officials you
 
01:11:13.709 --> 01:11:13.719 align:start position:0%
can show um propagandizing if that's
 
01:11:14.669 --> 01:11:14.679 align:start position:0%
what you want to call it I mean they
 
01:11:16.709 --> 01:11:16.719 align:start position:0%
would call it I think education um you
 
01:11:19.030 --> 01:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
can show censorship and again they would
 
01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
call it you know uh reduction of
 
01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
misinformation and what I've talked
 
01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
about here today really is secrecy so
 
01:11:27.070 --> 01:11:27.080 align:start position:0%
you have those sort of three things and
 
01:11:28.669 --> 01:11:28.679 align:start position:0%
you have evidence of all three of those
 
01:11:28.679 --> 01:11:29.830 align:start position:0%
you have evidence of all three of those
I

01:11:29.830 --> 01:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:11:32.189 --> 01:11:32.199 align:start position:0%
think thank you very
 
01:11:36.310 --> 01:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
much repres po off I have a question on
 
01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
PRS and EB so to the extent that uh
 
01:11:45.189 --> 01:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
virus uh database could be queried uh
 
01:11:48.790 --> 01:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
publicly by anyone is there any way that
 
01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
we can reproduce uh PR or EB testing for
 
01:11:55.709 --> 01:11:55.719 align:start position:0%
signals or is it some kind of secret the
 
01:11:58.070 --> 01:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
algorithms that they're using I'm really
 
01:11:59.550 --> 01:11:59.560 align:start position:0%
glad you asked that question thank you I
 
01:12:01.870 --> 01:12:01.880 align:start position:0%
meant to to touch on that before um so
 
01:12:05.870 --> 01:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
there is a public facing theirs um but
 
01:12:08.910 --> 01:12:08.920 align:start position:0%
it has several kind of limitations one
 
01:12:11.709 --> 01:12:11.719 align:start position:0%
is that there is sometimes an incredibly
 
01:12:13.870 --> 01:12:13.880 align:start position:0%
long time lag before reports that are
 
01:12:15.629 --> 01:12:15.639 align:start position:0%
made that might show up in those daily
 
01:12:18.030 --> 01:12:18.040 align:start position:0%
priority reports actually make their way
 
01:12:21.550 --> 01:12:21.560 align:start position:0%
to theirs so so you don't have sort of
 
01:12:24.310 --> 01:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
real time analysis and I mean and there
 
01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
there's also number of people there's an
 
01:12:28.110 --> 01:12:28.120 align:start position:0%
organization called react 19 which is
 
01:12:29.910 --> 01:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
started by people who some of the people
 
01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
who contacted NIH about their
 
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
neurological injuries um you know and
 
01:12:38.149 --> 01:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
and uh they have made there's there
 
01:12:39.310 --> 01:12:39.320 align:start position:0%
there are people who have made reports
 
01:12:41.229 --> 01:12:41.239 align:start position:0%
to vars that never even make it to the
 
01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
public facing database so we don't know
 
01:12:45.110 --> 01:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
how much Fidelity there is between
 
01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
what's reported and what's you know at
 
01:12:49.229 --> 01:12:49.239 align:start position:0%
the back end and what appears on the
 
01:12:51.229 --> 01:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
Publican the other thing is that you
 
01:12:52.990 --> 01:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
know when there are follow-up reports
 
01:12:54.590 --> 01:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
submitted to V like if somebody had
 
01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:55.870 align:start position:0%
submitted to V like if somebody had
myard

01:12:55.870 --> 01:12:55.880 align:start position:0%
myard
 
01:12:58.229 --> 01:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
and then died let's just say you the
 
01:13:00.070 --> 01:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
public would see the myocarditis report
 
01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
but they wouldn't see the death report
 
01:13:02.910 --> 01:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
because they're not the The public's
 
01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
facing reports aren't updated so I think
 
01:13:08.229 --> 01:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
you know um I know that there were some
 
01:13:11.189 --> 01:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
researchers early on who were doing PR
 
01:13:13.310 --> 01:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
with the public facing data and coming
 
01:13:15.709 --> 01:13:15.719 align:start position:0%
up with you know some troubling results
 
01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
um uh but um but I you know I I I don't
 
01:13:21.470 --> 01:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
think you could fully reproduce it you
 
01:13:22.750 --> 01:13:22.760 align:start position:0%
know and the other thing is with the EB
 
01:13:25.149 --> 01:13:25.159 align:start position:0%
mining um we don't know what they use
 
01:13:27.310 --> 01:13:27.320 align:start position:0%
what the FDA used as their comparators
 
01:13:28.750 --> 01:13:28.760 align:start position:0%
you know you need you need sort of the
 
01:13:30.510 --> 01:13:30.520 align:start position:0%
empirical comparators and stuff like
 
01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
that so so I think it would be hard to
 
01:13:34.709 --> 01:13:34.719 align:start position:0%
reproduce and also the other thing is
 
01:13:36.270 --> 01:13:36.280 align:start position:0%
even if we did that the thing that we
 
01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
don't have is what did they do when they
 
01:13:39.669 --> 01:13:39.679 align:start position:0%
found the safety signals what follow-up
 
01:13:46.270 --> 01:13:46.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:51.390 --> 01:13:51.400 align:start position:0%
did um so Children's Health defense can
 
01:13:53.189 --> 01:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
you tell us a little little bit about
 
01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
your organization
 
01:13:58.470 --> 01:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
um how you got involved with the
 
01:14:01.870 --> 01:14:01.880 align:start position:0%
emergency use uh authorization vaccines
 
01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
and do people contact you uh to discuss
 
01:14:07.790 --> 01:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
what's going on with them and utilize
 
01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:09.280 align:start position:0%
you as a
 
01:14:12.430 --> 01:14:12.440 align:start position:0%
resource um I would say that so you know
 
01:14:15.470 --> 01:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
CHD is a um it's a virtual organization
 
01:14:16.910 --> 01:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't have a physical presence
 
01:14:19.550 --> 01:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
but do have a website and a newsletter I
 
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
think a lot of people turned to CHD
 
01:14:23.870 --> 01:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
during you know during the covid years
 
01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
for information um about a lot of you
 
01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
know a lot of topics related to you know
 
01:14:32.270 --> 01:14:32.280 align:start position:0%
particularly vaccines um V vaccine
 
01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:33.790 align:start position:0%
particularly vaccines um V vaccine
mandates

01:14:33.790 --> 01:14:33.800 align:start position:0%
mandates
 
01:14:37.070 --> 01:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
um uh what was the second part of your
 
01:14:40.350 --> 01:14:40.360 align:start position:0%
question I'm sorry oh how I yeah so I
 
01:14:42.070 --> 01:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
got involved with CHD I was actually
 
01:14:44.110 --> 01:14:44.120 align:start position:0%
teaching at the law school in the fall
 
01:14:47.030 --> 01:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
of 2021 and I became very concerned
 
01:14:50.910 --> 01:14:50.920 align:start position:0%
about vaccine mandates um for you know I
 
01:14:52.750 --> 01:14:52.760 align:start position:0%
I testified at a hearing here and I you
 
01:14:54.709 --> 01:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
know and I I just just very very
 
01:14:57.550 --> 01:14:57.560 align:start position:0%
concerned concerned um so I um so I
 
01:14:58.830 --> 01:14:58.840 align:start position:0%
reached out to them to see if they could
 
01:15:00.510 --> 01:15:00.520 align:start position:0%
use some help and I uh they had a
 
01:15:02.669 --> 01:15:02.679 align:start position:0%
fellowship program so I started working
 
01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
them parttime and then I just ended up
 
01:15:05.990 --> 01:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
transitioning over to working with them
 
01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.270 align:start position:0%
transitioning over to working with them
full-time

01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
full-time
 
01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
um represent beler thank you again Madam
 
01:15:13.550 --> 01:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you again for
 
01:15:17.110 --> 01:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
entertaining my many questions um so in
 
01:15:19.310 --> 01:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
order to help us
 
01:15:21.950 --> 01:15:21.960 align:start position:0%
recollect the various things that were
 
01:15:24.550 --> 01:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
occurring I'd just like to ask you if if
 
01:15:28.990 --> 01:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
you call or have any um evidence for the
 
01:15:31.830 --> 01:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
various uh official justifications that
 
01:15:35.550 --> 01:15:35.560 align:start position:0%
were offered for both recommending or
 
01:15:39.470 --> 01:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
approving these vaccines throughout time
 
01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
uh so do do you recall that there was
 
01:15:43.510 --> 01:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
any official um statements being made
 
01:15:45.790 --> 01:15:45.800 align:start position:0%
either at the federal or state level
 
01:15:48.709 --> 01:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
that the vaccines um would prevent the
 
01:15:51.030 --> 01:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
spread of
 
01:15:52.990 --> 01:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
covid-19 well there obviously there were
 
01:15:54.310 --> 01:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of statements made to that effect
 
01:15:56.430 --> 01:15:56.440 align:start position:0%
I mean I don't think that's what I mean
 
01:15:57.910 --> 01:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
that that wasn't part of the approval
 
01:15:59.310 --> 01:15:59.320 align:start position:0%
process because it's obvious from the
 
01:16:01.030 --> 01:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
approval documents that you know The
 
01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
Regulators knew that they hadn't been
 
01:16:06.350 --> 01:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
tested to prevent transmission so but
 
01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
that's what was sort of said a lot in
 
01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
public was it that yeah and if I may
 
01:16:12.229 --> 01:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
follow up do you recall any official
 
01:16:14.709 --> 01:16:14.719 align:start position:0%
statements state or federal suggesting
 
01:16:16.590 --> 01:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
that receipt of the vaccine would
 
01:16:19.510 --> 01:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
prevent an individual from Catching
 
01:16:21.669 --> 01:16:21.679 align:start position:0%
covid I know there were statements like
 
01:16:22.990 --> 01:16:23.000 align:start position:0%
I don't remember who made them but they
 
01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
were certainly um I most I remember the
 
01:16:27.790 --> 01:16:27.800 align:start position:0%
Rachel mat's statement which she's not a
 
01:16:30.350 --> 01:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
federal official obviously but uh and if
 
01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
I may follow up again do you uh recall
 
01:16:36.149 --> 01:16:36.159 align:start position:0%
any official statements state or federal
 
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
that um the vaccines were uh reducing
 
01:16:43.990 --> 01:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
morbidity and mortality to the covid
 
01:16:45.750 --> 01:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
infection yes there were a lot of
 
01:16:47.629 --> 01:16:47.639 align:start position:0%
statements made to that effect I think
 
01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
um So based on those three things
 
01:16:50.790 --> 01:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
stopping the spread preventing the
 
01:16:52.629 --> 01:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
recipient from Catching Co and reducing
 
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
morbidity and mortality are you aware of
 
01:16:59.550 --> 01:16:59.560 align:start position:0%
any of any good data that suggests any
 
01:17:02.430 --> 01:17:02.440 align:start position:0%
of those statements were correct and
 
01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:07.800 align:start position:0%
true so I certainly know that there were
 
01:17:09.709 --> 01:17:09.719 align:start position:0%
no clinical trials that showed any of
 
01:17:11.270 --> 01:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
those things and obviously clinical
 
01:17:13.590 --> 01:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
trials are the gold standard for data
 
01:17:15.870 --> 01:17:15.880 align:start position:0%
right because they really can't be you
 
01:17:18.910 --> 01:17:18.920 align:start position:0%
know manipulated in in in the way EP
 
01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
epidemiological studies can be
 
01:17:23.030 --> 01:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
manipulated I'm sure that there are some
 
01:17:25.149 --> 01:17:25.159 align:start position:0%
epidemiological studies that say that
 
01:17:29.070 --> 01:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
things but um you know you have to you
 
01:17:32.030 --> 01:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
have to analyze those closely to sort of
 
01:17:35.110 --> 01:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
see how various choices are made about
 
01:17:37.229 --> 01:17:37.239 align:start position:0%
what data to include what populations to
 
01:17:38.950 --> 01:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
study how to Crunch the data but you
 
01:17:42.709 --> 01:17:42.719 align:start position:0%
know you can't you you just can't get
 
01:17:44.750 --> 01:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
you don't get the same kind of data from
 
01:17:47.709 --> 01:17:47.719 align:start position:0%
from you know from sort of retrospective
 
01:17:50.350 --> 01:17:50.360 align:start position:0%
EP epidemiological analyses so I'm not
 
01:17:52.110 --> 01:17:52.120 align:start position:0%
aware of any but this is also not my
 
01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
field of expertise so you need to really
 
01:17:55.990 --> 01:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
ask I mean for a for a better answer you
 
01:17:57.709 --> 01:17:57.719 align:start position:0%
need to talk to somebody else about it
 
01:17:59.750 --> 01:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
sure and thank you if I may ask one more
 
01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh just to again ask if you can
 
01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
cooperate or have any information on
 
01:18:06.350 --> 01:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
testimony we have previously received
 
01:18:11.070 --> 01:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
that in the process of um conducting the
 
01:18:14.709 --> 01:18:14.719 align:start position:0%
clinical trials for the covid
 
01:18:14.719 --> 01:18:16.270 align:start position:0%
clinical trials for the covid
vaccines

01:18:16.270 --> 01:18:16.280 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
01:18:20.950 --> 01:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
that at the point that they chose to
 
01:18:25.229 --> 01:18:25.239 align:start position:0%
vaccinate the control group they did so
 
01:18:27.870 --> 01:18:27.880 align:start position:0%
um actually over the recommendations and
 
01:18:30.189 --> 01:18:30.199 align:start position:0%
requests of certain federal government
 
01:18:32.350 --> 01:18:32.360 align:start position:0%
Regulators who were requesting at the
 
01:18:34.270 --> 01:18:34.280 align:start position:0%
time that they not vaccinate the control
 
01:18:37.030 --> 01:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
group not prohibiting it but requesting
 
01:18:38.669 --> 01:18:38.679 align:start position:0%
do you have any information uh in that
 
01:18:40.590 --> 01:18:40.600 align:start position:0%
regard I've heard that but I don't have
 
01:18:42.070 --> 01:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
any information I don't remember where I
 
01:18:44.430 --> 01:18:44.440 align:start position:0%
heard it but I have heard that thank
 
01:18:47.629 --> 01:18:47.639 align:start position:0%
you representative wary thank you madam
 
01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you again for your
 
01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
testimony uh very informative um I I
 
01:18:56.669 --> 01:18:56.679 align:start position:0%
just uh had some uh questions you know
 
01:19:00.030 --> 01:19:00.040 align:start position:0%
in the in the past when they had
 
01:19:04.350 --> 01:19:04.360 align:start position:0%
um the bird flu um vaccine and and there
 
01:19:07.030 --> 01:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
was a number of Adverse Events early on
 
01:19:09.390 --> 01:19:09.400 align:start position:0%
with that they pulled it from the market
 
01:19:12.390 --> 01:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
you know just a uh a decade or so ago I
 
01:19:16.870 --> 01:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
forget the exact timing of that and so
 
01:19:19.950 --> 01:19:19.960 align:start position:0%
um there they were take there the FDA
 
01:19:21.990 --> 01:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
seemed to take
 
01:19:27.030 --> 01:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
precautions um in in a manner that uh
 
01:19:30.629 --> 01:19:30.639 align:start position:0%
sought to protect the public um do you
 
01:19:35.669 --> 01:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:35.679 --> 01:19:38.229 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:19:38.229 --> 01:19:38.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:41.229 --> 01:19:41.239 align:start position:0%
um we didn't see the same sort
 
01:19:43.990 --> 01:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
of reaction this time and do you have
 
01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.629 align:start position:0%
of reaction this time and do you have
any

01:19:45.629 --> 01:19:45.639 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:19:49.590 --> 01:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
uh theories or speculation why this sort
 
01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:51.550 align:start position:0%
uh theories or speculation why this sort
of

01:19:51.550 --> 01:19:51.560 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:19:54.750 --> 01:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
um kind of proactive
 
01:19:57.870 --> 01:19:57.880 align:start position:0%
uh safeguards were were not uh utilized
 
01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
as they were for previous
 
01:20:03.189 --> 01:20:03.199 align:start position:0%
vaccines that is a very good question
 
01:20:06.229 --> 01:20:06.239 align:start position:0%
and a really important one to be asking
 
01:20:09.990 --> 01:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
and I have only speculations that just I
 
01:20:11.950 --> 01:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
I don't feel like it's my place to sort
 
01:20:15.149 --> 01:20:15.159 align:start position:0%
of I I I just don't know you know I mean
 
01:20:16.669 --> 01:20:16.679 align:start position:0%
but I I think that that's a really
 
01:20:18.950 --> 01:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
important question to be asking and you
 
01:20:21.229 --> 01:20:21.239 align:start position:0%
know because there are real differences
 
01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
and there just you know the the sheer
 
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
volume of adverse events that have been
 
01:20:28.430 --> 01:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
reported is just you know dwarfs all
 
01:20:30.750 --> 01:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
other vaccines combined for 30 years and
 
01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
so even if you say that doesn't show
 
01:20:36.229 --> 01:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
causation we have the safety signals and
 
01:20:38.470 --> 01:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
the little bit of you know data mining
 
01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:40.679 align:start position:0%
that results that we have we have lots
 
01:20:42.830 --> 01:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
of people reporting really just horrific
 
01:20:45.910 --> 01:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
injuries you know within minutes hours
 
01:20:50.350 --> 01:20:50.360 align:start position:0%
days so clearly there's a problem and so
 
01:20:55.830 --> 01:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:57.790 --> 01:20:57.800 align:start position:0%
thank you if I I may have another
 
01:20:57.800 --> 01:20:59.229 align:start position:0%
thank you if I I may have another
question

01:20:59.229 --> 01:20:59.239 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:21:04.830 --> 01:21:04.840 align:start position:0%
um so in the in the normal drug and
 
01:21:07.229 --> 01:21:07.239 align:start position:0%
biologic and vaccine approval process
 
01:21:09.910 --> 01:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
there's a series of animal studies those
 
01:21:11.910 --> 01:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
are referred to as preclinical or
 
01:21:14.350 --> 01:21:14.360 align:start position:0%
non-clinical done under good laboratory
 
01:21:18.910 --> 01:21:18.920 align:start position:0%
practice regulations and then after um
 
01:21:21.310 --> 01:21:21.320 align:start position:0%
an initial wave of those types of animal
 
01:21:23.390 --> 01:21:23.400 align:start position:0%
studies are done then they begin
 
01:21:26.189 --> 01:21:26.199 align:start position:0%
clinical first in trials and things like
 
01:21:26.199 --> 01:21:27.950 align:start position:0%
clinical first in trials and things like
that

01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:21:32.110 --> 01:21:32.120 align:start position:0%
um it seems to me that for the Emergency
 
01:21:35.070 --> 01:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
youth use authorization that there
 
01:21:38.790 --> 01:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
should have been um sufficient data to
 
01:21:42.350 --> 01:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
safety data from the preclinical studies
 
01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:43.990 align:start position:0%
safety data from the preclinical studies
to

01:21:43.990 --> 01:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.990 align:start position:0%
to
justify

01:21:45.990 --> 01:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
justify
 
01:21:49.990 --> 01:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
a posited safety profile for the
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
Emergency use authorization has any of
 
01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:55.030 align:start position:0%
Emergency use authorization has any of
your

01:21:55.030 --> 01:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:21:59.270 --> 01:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
inquiries into the FDA or
 
01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
um touched upon that in any way no no
 
01:22:06.189 --> 01:22:06.199 align:start position:0%
they haven't i' I've read some stuff
 
01:22:09.189 --> 01:22:09.199 align:start position:0%
about uh a a study done in rats that
 
01:22:11.149 --> 01:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
madna did where there was some fetal
 
01:22:13.270 --> 01:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
abnormalities but I don't it's not it's
 
01:22:15.310 --> 01:22:15.320 align:start position:0%
not something that I really have any
 
01:22:19.030 --> 01:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:23.229 --> 01:22:23.239 align:start position:0%
about one more uh question so um I think
 
01:22:24.709 --> 01:22:24.719 align:start position:0%
you mentioned earlier in your your
 
01:22:26.310 --> 01:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
testimony that there
 
01:22:30.790 --> 01:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
were um the studies or the protocols the
 
01:22:32.070 --> 01:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
uh human
 
01:22:35.669 --> 01:22:35.679 align:start position:0%
protocols uh the sorry the clinical
 
01:22:39.669 --> 01:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
study protocols on humans had excluded
 
01:22:42.910 --> 01:22:42.920 align:start position:0%
pregnant women uh individuals under
 
01:22:46.550 --> 01:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
18 um do you know and some others I
 
01:22:49.270 --> 01:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
think you mentioned one other I forget
 
01:22:51.870 --> 01:22:51.880 align:start position:0%
um I believe Amun compromise I'm not
 
01:22:53.910 --> 01:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
100% sure but it's to go back to the
 
01:22:55.950 --> 01:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
stud yeah you no compromise that that
 
01:22:58.990 --> 01:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
makes perfect sense um do you know
 
01:23:02.750 --> 01:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
if at any point during the emergency use
 
01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
authorization that whether or not these
 
01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:07.149 align:start position:0%
authorization that whether or not these
companies

01:23:07.149 --> 01:23:07.159 align:start position:0%
companies
 
01:23:07.159 --> 01:23:08.669 align:start position:0%
companies
then

01:23:08.669 --> 01:23:08.679 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:23:12.149 --> 01:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
um either pulled in data from those uh
 
01:23:15.110 --> 01:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
demographics or populations in order to
 
01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
understand the effect because they were
 
01:23:20.550 --> 01:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
certainly uh promulgating their
 
01:23:23.629 --> 01:23:23.639 align:start position:0%
vaccination um but but in the absence of
 
01:23:25.709 --> 01:23:25.719 align:start position:0%
any substantive
 
01:23:31.149 --> 01:23:31.159 align:start position:0%
data um even though at that point those
 
01:23:32.590 --> 01:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
demographics were actually being
 
01:23:36.430 --> 01:23:36.440 align:start position:0%
subjected or uh advised to take the
 
01:23:38.470 --> 01:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
vaccine so I'm I'm just curious if you
 
01:23:41.990 --> 01:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
had heard anything in that vein either
 
01:23:44.189 --> 01:23:44.199 align:start position:0%
so I looked at this a little bit in the
 
01:23:47.790 --> 01:23:47.800 align:start position:0%
context of pregnant women and I I um I
 
01:23:49.590 --> 01:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
don't remember I I don't think that
 
01:23:51.629 --> 01:23:51.639 align:start position:0%
there were any separate clinical trials
 
01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
done for pregnant women and that all the
 
01:23:55.270 --> 01:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
data are from you know epidemiological
 
01:23:57.270 --> 01:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
studies and you know it's common for
 
01:23:58.709 --> 01:23:58.719 align:start position:0%
pregnant women to be excluded from
 
01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
clinical trials for obvious reasons you
 
01:24:02.950 --> 01:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
know so it's not that I'm criticizing
 
01:24:04.229 --> 01:24:04.239 align:start position:0%
the fact that you know that there's no
 
01:24:05.629 --> 01:24:05.639 align:start position:0%
reason to criticize that it was wise
 
01:24:08.110 --> 01:24:08.120 align:start position:0%
decision but you know um but since the
 
01:24:10.550 --> 01:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
roll out I do not think there have been
 
01:24:12.110 --> 01:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
so so again there's just been sort of
 
01:24:14.669 --> 01:24:14.679 align:start position:0%
study of what happens you know with
 
01:24:17.110 --> 01:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
various kinds of you know slicing the
 
01:24:18.990 --> 01:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
data in different ways to see how how
 
01:24:20.750 --> 01:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
they affect pregnant women I don't think
 
01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
there's been a separate clinical trial
 
01:24:24.390 --> 01:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
for for kids there have been some very
 
01:24:27.990 --> 01:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
small trials um and and for people you
 
01:24:29.790 --> 01:24:29.800 align:start position:0%
know who are immun to compromised don't
 
01:24:32.110 --> 01:24:32.120 align:start position:0%
I don't know but you know but certainly
 
01:24:33.550 --> 01:24:33.560 align:start position:0%
there haven't been any large scale
 
01:24:35.870 --> 01:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
clinical trials and um and that's really
 
01:24:38.629 --> 01:24:38.639 align:start position:0%
where you know most of the um you know
 
01:24:40.669 --> 01:24:40.679 align:start position:0%
the the the data that gets cited often
 
01:24:44.070 --> 01:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
come from there represent
 
01:24:46.669 --> 01:24:46.679 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you madam chair and thank
 
01:24:49.030 --> 01:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
you again and though I I mean you may or
 
01:24:52.109 --> 01:24:52.119 align:start position:0%
may not specialize in this field but as
 
01:24:55.350 --> 01:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
a a person with the back ground in law
 
01:24:57.470 --> 01:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
and this kind of work I'm sure you have
 
01:25:01.109 --> 01:25:01.119 align:start position:0%
some exposure to basic legal ethics so I
 
01:25:06.109 --> 01:25:06.119 align:start position:0%
would ask your um your input on the
 
01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
whether or not you think it's prudent
 
01:25:11.070 --> 01:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
and appropriate that a government
 
01:25:12.990 --> 01:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
government regulatory body in this case
 
01:25:14.990 --> 01:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
the NIH
 
01:25:17.629 --> 01:25:17.639 align:start position:0%
um simultaneously is tasked with a
 
01:25:20.709 --> 01:25:20.719 align:start position:0%
certain degree of regulating but also is
 
01:25:24.390 --> 01:25:24.400 align:start position:0%
a patent holder for vaccine technology
 
01:25:26.189 --> 01:25:26.199 align:start position:0%
ology in this case they they were a
 
01:25:28.510 --> 01:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
partial patent holder released for the
 
01:25:29.950 --> 01:25:29.960 align:start position:0%
um mRNA
 
01:25:34.709 --> 01:25:34.719 align:start position:0%
technology and also controlling the subs
 
01:25:37.430 --> 01:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
the most substantial tranch of funding
 
01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
in existence for conducting scientific
 
01:25:46.390 --> 01:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
studies of um of medications and and
 
01:25:48.870 --> 01:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
such I think your question answers
 
01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:54.629 align:start position:0%
such I think your question answers
itself

01:25:54.629 --> 01:25:54.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:59.310 --> 01:25:59.320 align:start position:0%
um does your organization uh deal at all
 
01:26:01.669 --> 01:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire vaccine
 
01:26:03.390 --> 01:26:03.400 align:start position:0%
Association or go to any of their
 
01:26:06.750 --> 01:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
meetings and discussion
 
01:26:09.709 --> 01:26:09.719 align:start position:0%
so no we have not well there they're
 
01:26:11.350 --> 01:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
probably people at those meetings who
 
01:26:13.310 --> 01:26:13.320 align:start position:0%
are members of Children's Health defense
 
01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
I haven't you know and I there hasn't
 
01:26:17.950 --> 01:26:17.960 align:start position:0%
been an official presence there although
 
01:26:20.270 --> 01:26:20.280 align:start position:0%
I I
 
01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
should okay thank you yeah any other
 
01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.470 align:start position:0%
should okay thank you yeah any other
questions

01:26:26.470 --> 01:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:30.070 --> 01:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
s thank you so much for being here and
 
01:26:32.510 --> 01:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
presenting this data it's been extremely
 
01:26:38.830 --> 01:26:38.840 align:start position:0%
informative for us um it seems to co
 
01:26:42.709 --> 01:26:42.719 align:start position:0%
collaborate what we're hearing out there
 
01:26:47.910 --> 01:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
um I guess my concern is that the data
 
01:26:49.870 --> 01:26:49.880 align:start position:0%
isn't getting out to the public and at
 
01:26:54.870 --> 01:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
the same time we're still um
 
01:26:58.510 --> 01:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
pushing something that uh isn't licensed
 
01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:01.560 align:start position:0%
and we know that there's uh adverse
 
01:27:03.390 --> 01:27:03.400 align:start position:0%
effects happening we just don't know
 
01:27:05.790 --> 01:27:05.800 align:start position:0%
what to extent and I think that's
 
01:27:09.669 --> 01:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
important for the public to to hear and
 
01:27:11.669 --> 01:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
know and as you said
 
01:27:14.830 --> 01:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
transparency uh should be above all else
 
01:27:16.950 --> 01:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
when we're dealing with government
 
01:27:20.750 --> 01:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
entities um so again thank you again I
 
01:27:22.109 --> 01:27:22.119 align:start position:0%
can't tell you how much we appreciate
 
01:27:27.189 --> 01:27:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:29.350 --> 01:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else uh that would like
 
01:27:32.070 --> 01:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
to come up and testify or have anything
 
01:27:36.189 --> 01:27:36.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:38.669 --> 01:27:38.679 align:start position:0%
say okay
 
01:27:41.470 --> 01:27:41.480 align:start position:0%
thanks all right so our next meeting is
 
01:27:45.390 --> 01:27:45.400 align:start position:0%
scheduled for next Friday October 4th uh
 
01:27:47.629 --> 01:27:47.639 align:start position:0%
at the moment I don't have uh anyone
 
01:27:51.229 --> 01:27:51.239 align:start position:0%
coming in uh to speak to us but we do
 
01:27:56.790 --> 01:27:56.800 align:start position:0%
have a uh report to get out um so I
 
01:27:59.149 --> 01:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
think uh we can either take some time
 
01:28:02.590 --> 01:28:02.600 align:start position:0%
now uh if anyone would like to do that
 
01:28:05.709 --> 01:28:05.719 align:start position:0%
and we can work on that
 
01:28:09.189 --> 01:28:09.199 align:start position:0%
um uh some next week I probably will not
 
01:28:11.310 --> 01:28:11.320 align:start position:0%
call a meeting on October 11th because
 
01:28:14.510 --> 01:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
we do have uh veto day the day before
 
01:28:16.990 --> 01:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
which uh is a lot and then there's
 
01:28:19.470 --> 01:28:19.480 align:start position:0%
committee meetings going on throughout
 
01:28:22.629 --> 01:28:22.639 align:start position:0%
so uh our next meeting is October 4th
 
01:28:24.109 --> 01:28:24.119 align:start position:0%
and then we will have one on October
 
01:28:24.119 --> 01:28:25.390 align:start position:0%
and then we will have one on October
October

01:28:25.390 --> 01:28:25.400 align:start position:0%
October
 
01:28:29.750 --> 01:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
18th uh we'll be scheduling one then and
 
01:28:33.109 --> 01:28:33.119 align:start position:0%
probably the Friday the two Fridays
 
01:28:35.310 --> 01:28:35.320 align:start position:0%
after that or that Friday because
 
01:28:37.109 --> 01:28:37.119 align:start position:0%
November 1st I'm not sure if that is a
 
01:28:41.350 --> 01:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
Friday or not but um we need to uh make
 
01:28:43.109 --> 01:28:43.119 align:start position:0%
sure our
 
01:28:47.430 --> 01:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
report that's kind of like my deadline
 
01:28:51.830 --> 01:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
for that um so uh does anyone have any
 
01:28:54.629 --> 01:28:54.639 align:start position:0%
issues or uh anything
 
01:28:57.109 --> 01:28:57.119 align:start position:0%
they'd like to discuss I'm
 
01:28:59.990 --> 01:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
open represent belgum than Madam chair
 
01:29:02.950 --> 01:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
and entirely at your discretion I have
 
01:29:07.189 --> 01:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
begun uh drafting for consideration uh
 
01:29:09.910 --> 01:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
the report as at this point I've only
 
01:29:12.149 --> 01:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
I've only done a very rough draft of of
 
01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
the beginning the opening which is a
 
01:29:15.910 --> 01:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
summary of sort of looking at the the
 
01:29:19.070 --> 01:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
main purpose of this committee uh and
 
01:29:21.470 --> 01:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
I've just just begun but not yet really
 
01:29:23.430 --> 01:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
have anything in the main body which
 
01:29:25.629 --> 01:29:25.639 align:start position:0%
will examine really all of the issues
 
01:29:28.350 --> 01:29:28.360 align:start position:0%
and provide um the information and
 
01:29:30.550 --> 01:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
testimony that we've received uh but I
 
01:29:33.070 --> 01:29:33.080 align:start position:0%
would be happy if you'd like to try to
 
01:29:36.470 --> 01:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
forward um a copy of what I have thus
 
01:29:39.870 --> 01:29:39.880 align:start position:0%
far so we can look at it or whatever you
 
01:29:43.870 --> 01:29:43.880 align:start position:0%
like that would be wonderful um I mean
 
01:29:45.669 --> 01:29:45.679 align:start position:0%
it's I don't think this is going to be a
 
01:29:49.910 --> 01:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
10-page report so I think uh I think the
 
01:29:52.910 --> 01:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
sooner we get started the better the
 
01:29:54.910 --> 01:29:54.920 align:start position:0%
rough draft of the summary portion is
 
01:29:58.790 --> 01:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
about five or six pages so I'll I'll uh
 
01:29:59.790 --> 01:29:59.800 align:start position:0%
how would you like me to forward that
 
01:30:01.149 --> 01:30:01.159 align:start position:0%
would you like us to print it right now
 
01:30:03.709 --> 01:30:03.719 align:start position:0%
or how how would you like um does
 
01:30:06.270 --> 01:30:06.280 align:start position:0%
everyone have access to email right
 
01:30:10.030 --> 01:30:10.040 align:start position:0%
now okay why don't we just do uh to the
 
01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:44.189 align:start position:0%
now okay why don't we just do uh to the
committee

01:30:44.189 --> 01:30:44.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:49.030 --> 01:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
uh why don't we take a recess until uh
 
01:30:52.910 --> 01:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:52.920 --> 01:31:22.910 align:start position:0%
 
recess

01:31:22.910 --> 01:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:52.830 align:start position:0%

01:41:41.109 --> 01:41:41.119 align:start position:0%
the time being 11:40 I'm going to call
 
01:41:43.990 --> 01:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:48.430 --> 01:41:48.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:50.470 --> 01:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
meeting representative Belo I just want
 
01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
to thank you uh for for doing this and
 
01:41:57.669 --> 01:41:57.679 align:start position:0%
uh sending this out uh to give us a
 
01:42:00.750 --> 01:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
start um I love the fact that not we're
 
01:42:04.629 --> 01:42:04.639 align:start position:0%
not waiting to the last minute here um
 
01:42:06.550 --> 01:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
and if anyone has a chance to look at it
 
01:42:09.709 --> 01:42:09.719 align:start position:0%
I mean the first thing that he does is
 
01:42:12.270 --> 01:42:12.280 align:start position:0%
put our mission statement right up front
 
01:42:14.629 --> 01:42:14.639 align:start position:0%
uh which I think is important uh for
 
01:42:16.950 --> 01:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
this report um would you like to go
 
01:42:19.350 --> 01:42:19.360 align:start position:0%
through anything and highlight anything
 
01:42:21.229 --> 01:42:21.239 align:start position:0%
representative sure I'll I'll just walk
 
01:42:23.589 --> 01:42:23.599 align:start position:0%
us through and again this is only a
 
01:42:28.550 --> 01:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
rough rough draft of a first copy of the
 
01:42:30.430 --> 01:42:30.440 align:start position:0%
introduction to the report it's not the
 
01:42:33.470 --> 01:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
main body of the report um as I say
 
01:42:35.189 --> 01:42:35.199 align:start position:0%
bottom line up front which is another
 
01:42:37.950 --> 01:42:37.960 align:start position:0%
way of saying a brief summary
 
01:42:42.149 --> 01:42:42.159 align:start position:0%
um that we have looked through the
 
01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
totality of evidence that we have
 
01:42:45.270 --> 01:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
received the
 
01:42:48.470 --> 01:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
testimony um in particular the
 
01:42:52.550 --> 01:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
data um that we have received regarding
 
01:42:55.910 --> 01:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
the hand in of the pandemic the state
 
01:42:58.149 --> 01:42:58.159 align:start position:0%
actions there will be a lot more to
 
01:43:00.390 --> 01:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
discuss as far as all of the specifics
 
01:43:04.870 --> 01:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
but the 10,000 foot view is um well
 
01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
what's our committee called the covid
 
01:43:10.229 --> 01:43:10.239 align:start position:0%
response efficacy committee what was the
 
01:43:12.510 --> 01:43:12.520 align:start position:0%
efficacy of the state's response to
 
01:43:17.270 --> 01:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
covid so in order to define efficacy you
 
01:43:20.229 --> 01:43:20.239 align:start position:0%
have to first identify what the goal is
 
01:43:22.669 --> 01:43:22.679 align:start position:0%
and I I think you'll probably agree with
 
01:43:24.270 --> 01:43:24.280 align:start position:0%
me if you don't feel free obviously to
 
01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:25.950 align:start position:0%
me if you don't feel free obviously to
disagree

01:43:25.950 --> 01:43:25.960 align:start position:0%
disagree
 
01:43:30.510 --> 01:43:30.520 align:start position:0%
but there was not a single obvious
 
01:43:33.270 --> 01:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
overriding goal that we can point to
 
01:43:35.109 --> 01:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
based on everything we received and say
 
01:43:37.950 --> 01:43:37.960 align:start position:0%
this was the goal of everything we did
 
01:43:40.109 --> 01:43:40.119 align:start position:0%
so what I've done is I've broken out
 
01:43:42.510 --> 01:43:42.520 align:start position:0%
several of the items that were given to
 
01:43:46.430 --> 01:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
us as goals at various point in times
 
01:43:50.109 --> 01:43:50.119 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic um and what the
 
01:43:53.229 --> 01:43:53.239 align:start position:0%
ultimate result was of our actions as a
 
01:43:55.990 --> 01:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
state so the the first goal that I've
 
01:43:58.709 --> 01:43:58.719 align:start position:0%
identified that was provided um by
 
01:44:04.910 --> 01:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
various sources to us um was that the
 
01:44:08.350 --> 01:44:08.360 align:start position:0%
the goal initially appeared to be to
 
01:44:11.109 --> 01:44:11.119 align:start position:0%
Halt the transmission of the SARS cove2
 
01:44:13.550 --> 01:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
virus spreading amongst the population
 
01:44:16.750 --> 01:44:16.760 align:start position:0%
to effectively let it burn out um in an
 
01:44:18.550 --> 01:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
effort to prevent it from becoming
 
01:44:21.709 --> 01:44:21.719 align:start position:0%
endemic or or settling permanently
 
01:44:24.790 --> 01:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
amongst the population
 
01:44:27.189 --> 01:44:27.199 align:start position:0%
um now there's no way to sugarcoat the
 
01:44:30.149 --> 01:44:30.159 align:start position:0%
fact that that didn't happen clearly
 
01:44:32.629 --> 01:44:32.639 align:start position:0%
SARS Cove 2 is endemic I've got a
 
01:44:37.669 --> 01:44:37.679 align:start position:0%
stepson at home with Co right now um so
 
01:44:42.709 --> 01:44:42.719 align:start position:0%
SARS Cove 2 is endemic it goes around um
 
01:44:44.510 --> 01:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
as a result the only the only thing we
 
01:44:46.149 --> 01:44:46.159 align:start position:0%
can say is that the totality of
 
01:44:47.510 --> 01:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
everything that the state did in order
 
01:44:48.950 --> 01:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
to prevent that from happening was
 
01:44:51.629 --> 01:44:51.639 align:start position:0%
obviously ineffective it did not work it
 
01:44:55.070 --> 01:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
failed in regard to that
 
01:44:57.790 --> 01:44:57.800 align:start position:0%
goal um second goal that we
 
01:44:59.870 --> 01:44:59.880 align:start position:0%
identified uh that either I I can
 
01:45:02.109 --> 01:45:02.119 align:start position:0%
identify based on everything we
 
01:45:06.229 --> 01:45:06.239 align:start position:0%
received um is
 
01:45:11.390 --> 01:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
that the goal of the actions taken was
 
01:45:15.229 --> 01:45:15.239 align:start position:0%
to substantially slow the spread of SARS
 
01:45:17.310 --> 01:45:17.320 align:start position:0%
Cove 2 Amongst the population in an
 
01:45:19.950 --> 01:45:19.960 align:start position:0%
effort to uh do several things first to
 
01:45:22.430 --> 01:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
prevent hospitals and icus from being
 
01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:23.990 align:start position:0%
prevent hospitals and icus from being
overwhelmed

01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed
 
01:45:26.030 --> 01:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
uh to buy further time to improve
 
01:45:28.950 --> 01:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
treatments and protocols and overall to
 
01:45:31.830 --> 01:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
reduce the morbidity and the mortality
 
01:45:34.310 --> 01:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
of the covid-19
 
01:45:38.390 --> 01:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
disease um so we I can pull from a
 
01:45:40.709 --> 01:45:40.719 align:start position:0%
number of different sources of evidence
 
01:45:45.109 --> 01:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
that we've received um to look at how
 
01:45:46.870 --> 01:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
what was the effect what was the effect
 
01:45:51.070 --> 01:45:51.080 align:start position:0%
of everything we did as a state on that
 
01:45:54.270 --> 01:45:54.280 align:start position:0%
goal well
 
01:45:54.280 --> 01:45:56.709 align:start position:0%
goal well
uh

01:45:56.709 --> 01:45:56.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:46:00.390 --> 01:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
first we note that based on every piece
 
01:46:03.830 --> 01:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
of data hard data not simply opinions or
 
01:46:06.709 --> 01:46:06.719 align:start position:0%
but hard data in that we can look at in
 
01:46:06.719 --> 01:46:08.550 align:start position:0%
but hard data in that we can look at in
graphical

01:46:08.550 --> 01:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
graphical
 
01:46:12.990 --> 01:46:13.000 align:start position:0%
representation was that there was no um
 
01:46:16.629 --> 01:46:16.639 align:start position:0%
there was certainly no noted Association
 
01:46:20.589 --> 01:46:20.599 align:start position:0%
temporally or in time between the
 
01:46:22.270 --> 01:46:22.280 align:start position:0%
various measures that were implemented
 
01:46:24.229 --> 01:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
by the state
 
01:46:29.310 --> 01:46:29.320 align:start position:0%
causing the spread to go um
 
01:46:31.870 --> 01:46:31.880 align:start position:0%
negative I believe it's also true that
 
01:46:34.390 --> 01:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
there is no obvious correlation between
 
01:46:37.790 --> 01:46:37.800 align:start position:0%
any measures the state took or rather
 
01:46:40.669 --> 01:46:40.679 align:start position:0%
the cumulative measures the state took
 
01:46:44.870 --> 01:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
and any um obvious
 
01:46:47.589 --> 01:46:47.599 align:start position:0%
disruption of the patterns that were
 
01:46:48.990 --> 01:46:49.000 align:start position:0%
already in
 
01:46:52.310 --> 01:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
progress um for instance early on when
 
01:46:55.669 --> 01:46:55.679 align:start position:0%
there was things such as um mandates
 
01:46:58.350 --> 01:46:58.360 align:start position:0%
around or mandates or guidance around
 
01:47:02.030 --> 01:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
masking staying at home closing certain
 
01:47:05.629 --> 01:47:05.639 align:start position:0%
businesses um we can look at the the
 
01:47:07.430 --> 01:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
graphical representation of the spread
 
01:47:10.629 --> 01:47:10.639 align:start position:0%
of covid during those periods of time
 
01:47:16.270 --> 01:47:16.280 align:start position:0%
and we find no obvious um
 
01:47:18.990 --> 01:47:19.000 align:start position:0%
correlation to those
 
01:47:22.350 --> 01:47:22.360 align:start position:0%
policies uh causing either a decrease or
 
01:47:27.030 --> 01:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
slow of any uh impr progress spread of
 
01:47:28.550 --> 01:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
the virus through the
 
01:47:33.629 --> 01:47:33.639 align:start position:0%
state um we can look at other uh
 
01:47:35.870 --> 01:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
testimony and information we receive
 
01:47:39.030 --> 01:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
because and we can't we can't
 
01:47:41.669 --> 01:47:41.679 align:start position:0%
unfortunately with any confidence say
 
01:47:45.350 --> 01:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
that any individual me measure had a
 
01:47:47.669 --> 01:47:47.679 align:start position:0%
positive or A negative effect because
 
01:47:49.470 --> 01:47:49.480 align:start position:0%
that would require us to be able to
 
01:47:52.830 --> 01:47:52.840 align:start position:0%
control for variables in retrospect that
 
01:47:55.430 --> 01:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
were not controlled for in other words
 
01:47:56.950 --> 01:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
the state took a totality of
 
01:47:59.790 --> 01:47:59.800 align:start position:0%
circumstance a totality of actions and
 
01:48:02.270 --> 01:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
all we can really analyze is the very
 
01:48:04.229 --> 01:48:04.239 align:start position:0%
real results of what happened as a
 
01:48:06.270 --> 01:48:06.280 align:start position:0%
result of that totality of
 
01:48:09.629 --> 01:48:09.639 align:start position:0%
circumstances so what I would recommend
 
01:48:11.070 --> 01:48:11.080 align:start position:0%
I think we can probably come to an
 
01:48:13.629 --> 01:48:13.639 align:start position:0%
agreement on is that we would recommend
 
01:48:15.950 --> 01:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
to other entities be it other
 
01:48:17.470 --> 01:48:17.480 align:start position:0%
investigative committees the private
 
01:48:20.830 --> 01:48:20.840 align:start position:0%
sector Academia to undertake the
 
01:48:23.990 --> 01:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
necessary controlled properly executed
 
01:48:29.149 --> 01:48:29.159 align:start position:0%
studies for various um individual items
 
01:48:31.109 --> 01:48:31.119 align:start position:0%
that were taken be it be it masking or
 
01:48:33.629 --> 01:48:33.639 align:start position:0%
social distancing or whatever they are
 
01:48:36.270 --> 01:48:36.280 align:start position:0%
and individually study each one with the
 
01:48:38.830 --> 01:48:38.840 align:start position:0%
proper controls to come up with some
 
01:48:41.390 --> 01:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
indication as to whether or not they
 
01:48:43.589 --> 01:48:43.599 align:start position:0%
individually could have any positive
 
01:48:47.149 --> 01:48:47.159 align:start position:0%
effect all we can say with a high degree
 
01:48:49.510 --> 01:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
of certainty is that the cumulative
 
01:48:52.149 --> 01:48:52.159 align:start position:0%
effect of all of the things put together
 
01:48:52.159 --> 01:48:54.310 align:start position:0%
effect of all of the things put together
was

01:48:54.310 --> 01:48:54.320 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:48:58.070 --> 01:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
um little to nothing in terms of the
 
01:48:58.080 --> 01:48:59.390 align:start position:0%
um little to nothing in terms of the
mitigation

01:48:59.390 --> 01:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
mitigation
 
01:49:03.510 --> 01:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
impact uh and and we can we can add to
 
01:49:05.870 --> 01:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
that and nobody's presented us with any
 
01:49:08.750 --> 01:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
evidence or data to suggest that all of
 
01:49:10.270 --> 01:49:10.280 align:start position:0%
the actions taken by the state of New
 
01:49:12.709 --> 01:49:12.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire actually spared a single
 
01:49:15.470 --> 01:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
person from Catching this
 
01:49:18.109 --> 01:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
virus uh as far as we can tell everybody
 
01:49:19.550 --> 01:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
has had it and most people have probably
 
01:49:22.229 --> 01:49:22.239 align:start position:0%
had it multiple times by now uh that's
 
01:49:23.950 --> 01:49:23.960 align:start position:0%
regardless of all the actions taken
 
01:49:27.030 --> 01:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
including including the
 
01:49:31.350 --> 01:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
vaccines um we talk a little bit about
 
01:49:35.950 --> 01:49:35.960 align:start position:0%
the uh the protocols and treatments and
 
01:49:39.430 --> 01:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
as they evolved over time for uh covid
 
01:49:41.550 --> 01:49:41.560 align:start position:0%
in order to determine whether the
 
01:49:44.510 --> 01:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
totality of actions taken by the state
 
01:49:48.109 --> 01:49:48.119 align:start position:0%
helped by time to develop more
 
01:49:50.350 --> 01:49:50.360 align:start position:0%
treatments that may have themselves
 
01:49:53.629 --> 01:49:53.639 align:start position:0%
reduced morbidity and mortality
 
01:49:57.350 --> 01:49:57.360 align:start position:0%
um the trouble is going to be here that
 
01:50:00.910 --> 01:50:00.920 align:start position:0%
we don't actually have good
 
01:50:03.669 --> 01:50:03.679 align:start position:0%
data except for this one thing that
 
01:50:06.310 --> 01:50:06.320 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about here we don't have good
 
01:50:09.950 --> 01:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
data that any of the actions
 
01:50:12.109 --> 01:50:12.119 align:start position:0%
taken be it
 
01:50:16.830 --> 01:50:16.840 align:start position:0%
vaccines or stay at home or masking we
 
01:50:18.709 --> 01:50:18.719 align:start position:0%
don't have we don't have good data that
 
01:50:21.270 --> 01:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
indicates any of those
 
01:50:24.270 --> 01:50:24.280 align:start position:0%
measures actually slowed the spread or
 
01:50:26.149 --> 01:50:26.159 align:start position:0%
bought any time at
 
01:50:28.550 --> 01:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
all which would mean that they had
 
01:50:32.109 --> 01:50:32.119 align:start position:0%
effectively no impact on buying time for
 
01:50:34.109 --> 01:50:34.119 align:start position:0%
further treatments now there is one
 
01:50:36.229 --> 01:50:36.239 align:start position:0%
treatment that did change early on it
 
01:50:39.750 --> 01:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
was a protocol around ventilator use um
 
01:50:41.990 --> 01:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
where early initial aggressive
 
01:50:45.109 --> 01:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
ventilator use was rolled back for a
 
01:50:47.149 --> 01:50:47.159 align:start position:0%
less aggressive pursuit of ventilator
 
01:50:50.390 --> 01:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
use um now as I said unfortunately we
 
01:50:52.189 --> 01:50:52.199 align:start position:0%
can't say we can't say that we bought
 
01:50:54.629 --> 01:50:54.639 align:start position:0%
time for this that help people because
 
01:50:56.350 --> 01:50:56.360 align:start position:0%
we can't see that there was any
 
01:50:58.189 --> 01:50:58.199 align:start position:0%
correlation between the measures we took
 
01:51:01.709 --> 01:51:01.719 align:start position:0%
and delaying the spread of covid um it
 
01:51:03.629 --> 01:51:03.639 align:start position:0%
is good however that this protocol did
 
01:51:06.709 --> 01:51:06.719 align:start position:0%
change and appeared to result in a
 
01:51:08.550 --> 01:51:08.560 align:start position:0%
reduction of morbidity and
 
01:51:12.390 --> 01:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
mortality uh around
 
01:51:17.550 --> 01:51:17.560 align:start position:0%
Co um now one one
 
01:51:21.229 --> 01:51:21.239 align:start position:0%
particularly represent wary if I sorry
 
01:51:24.189 --> 01:51:24.199 align:start position:0%
to interrupt um thank you madam chairman
 
01:51:24.199 --> 01:51:25.830 align:start position:0%
to interrupt um thank you madam chairman
um

01:51:25.830 --> 01:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:29.990 --> 01:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
if you said that it didn't have
 
01:51:34.669 --> 01:51:34.679 align:start position:0%
any efficaciousness or Effectiveness
 
01:51:37.669 --> 01:51:37.679 align:start position:0%
in achieving its
 
01:51:37.679 --> 01:51:41.069 align:start position:0%
in achieving its
goals

01:51:41.069 --> 01:51:41.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:45.510 --> 01:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
um are we are do we see or are you going
 
01:51:50.390 --> 01:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:54.310 --> 01:51:54.320 align:start position:0%
effect uh thank you for that question
 
01:51:57.470 --> 01:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
um we will do our obviously and I will
 
01:51:59.629 --> 01:51:59.639 align:start position:0%
do as as I review this data my best and
 
01:52:01.069 --> 01:52:01.079 align:start position:0%
with the you know consent of everyone
 
01:52:03.390 --> 01:52:03.400 align:start position:0%
involved before we issue a final report
 
01:52:03.400 --> 01:52:04.629 align:start position:0%
involved before we issue a final report
to

01:52:04.629 --> 01:52:04.639 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:52:07.109 --> 01:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
determine if we can
 
01:52:10.589 --> 01:52:10.599 align:start position:0%
determine um any sort of delerious or
 
01:52:12.390 --> 01:52:12.400 align:start position:0%
negative effects of any of these
 
01:52:14.350 --> 01:52:14.360 align:start position:0%
policies one thing that I I made a
 
01:52:15.910 --> 01:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
hypothetical and it's purely a
 
01:52:17.830 --> 01:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
hypothetical this is it's it's purely to
 
01:52:20.189 --> 01:52:20.199 align:start position:0%
demonstrate the difficulty of what of
 
01:52:23.390 --> 01:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
what you're asking is that because we
 
01:52:25.109 --> 01:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
can't go backward and control for
 
01:52:28.189 --> 01:52:28.199 align:start position:0%
variables in retrospect what we can do
 
01:52:30.709 --> 01:52:30.719 align:start position:0%
is we can look at um for instance
 
01:52:32.069 --> 01:52:32.079 align:start position:0%
there's a there is a correlation that
 
01:52:34.589 --> 01:52:34.599 align:start position:0%
can be pointed out Nationwide between
 
01:52:36.830 --> 01:52:36.840 align:start position:0%
the spread of covid and how much time
 
01:52:38.470 --> 01:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
people are spending indoors and that's
 
01:52:40.910 --> 01:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
seen based on the heating months in
 
01:52:43.030 --> 01:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
colder weather in colder regions tends
 
01:52:45.229 --> 01:52:45.239 align:start position:0%
to see upticks the cooling months in
 
01:52:47.870 --> 01:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
hotter re regions usually has resulted
 
01:52:50.870 --> 01:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
in Optics so we can say there appears to
 
01:52:52.470 --> 01:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
be a correlation between time spent and
 
01:52:53.550 --> 01:52:53.560 align:start position:0%
IND doors with other people in the
 
01:52:55.990 --> 01:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
spread of disease however because we
 
01:53:00.550 --> 01:53:00.560 align:start position:0%
didn't issue um in individual items as
 
01:53:02.430 --> 01:53:02.440 align:start position:0%
as the uh representative from the
 
01:53:03.830 --> 01:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:53:05.470 --> 01:53:05.480 align:start position:0%
testified they took what they call the
 
01:53:07.270 --> 01:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
Swiss cheese approach which is
 
01:53:08.629 --> 01:53:08.639 align:start position:0%
effectively throwing everything at the
 
01:53:11.149 --> 01:53:11.159 align:start position:0%
wall and see if anything sticks okay the
 
01:53:13.189 --> 01:53:13.199 align:start position:0%
trouble with that is it's impossible to
 
01:53:16.350 --> 01:53:16.360 align:start position:0%
tease out the individual effects that
 
01:53:18.830 --> 01:53:18.840 align:start position:0%
any individual item would have had in
 
01:53:20.830 --> 01:53:20.840 align:start position:0%
the absence of the other ones so the
 
01:53:23.350 --> 01:53:23.360 align:start position:0%
hypothetical was it it is it is
 
01:53:25.750 --> 01:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
conceivably possible that
 
01:53:28.790 --> 01:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
some guidance issued could have had a
 
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
positive impact if we also didn't issue
 
01:53:36.149 --> 01:53:36.159 align:start position:0%
guidance that closed beaches hiking
 
01:53:38.510 --> 01:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
trails thereby forcing people to gather
 
01:53:40.510 --> 01:53:40.520 align:start position:0%
indoors with each other maybe there was
 
01:53:42.910 --> 01:53:42.920 align:start position:0%
some effects that were positive and some
 
01:53:44.910 --> 01:53:44.920 align:start position:0%
that were negative but they canceled
 
01:53:46.870 --> 01:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
each other out it's very it's it's it's
 
01:53:48.990 --> 01:53:49.000 align:start position:0%
virtually impossible to know in
 
01:53:53.990 --> 01:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
hindsight um what was causing what uh
 
01:53:56.069 --> 01:53:56.079 align:start position:0%
representative warry thank you madam
 
01:53:58.390 --> 01:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
chair so I think um I think you've
 
01:54:01.470 --> 01:54:01.480 align:start position:0%
raised an opportunity where that concept
 
01:54:03.790 --> 01:54:03.800 align:start position:0%
at least can be introduced with the
 
01:54:08.189 --> 01:54:08.199 align:start position:0%
ventilators and the and then um extend
 
01:54:11.870 --> 01:54:11.880 align:start position:0%
that by your example from uh the
 
01:54:14.470 --> 01:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
mandates or the strong recommendations
 
01:54:16.830 --> 01:54:16.840 align:start position:0%
to stay indoors and the and the evidence
 
01:54:19.030 --> 01:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
for that I think those at least provide
 
01:54:23.189 --> 01:54:23.199 align:start position:0%
two opportunities to talk about how
 
01:54:23.199 --> 01:54:24.830 align:start position:0%
two opportunities to talk about how
there

01:54:24.830 --> 01:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:54:28.550 --> 01:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
were adverse causations from some of
 
01:54:32.310 --> 01:54:32.320 align:start position:0%
these recommendations that that
 
01:54:34.950 --> 01:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
exacerbated the situation rather than
 
01:54:38.350 --> 01:54:38.360 align:start position:0%
than mitigated it so I think I think and
 
01:54:41.229 --> 01:54:41.239 align:start position:0%
I think that's in line with the report
 
01:54:44.030 --> 01:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
as well if I'm not if I'm not mistaken
 
01:54:46.270 --> 01:54:46.280 align:start position:0%
so I think perhaps that's your
 
01:54:47.990 --> 01:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity and I think you provided
 
01:54:49.629 --> 01:54:49.639 align:start position:0%
actually the good examples of where you
 
01:54:52.830 --> 01:54:52.840 align:start position:0%
could introduce that and how
 
01:54:56.350 --> 01:54:56.360 align:start position:0%
I um I also believe that we heard a lot
 
01:55:00.350 --> 01:55:00.360 align:start position:0%
of information about uh education and
 
01:55:03.350 --> 01:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
children's uh health and mental health
 
01:55:06.830 --> 01:55:06.840 align:start position:0%
uh in regards to the whole covid uh
 
01:55:09.109 --> 01:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
shutdown um especially when commissioner
 
01:55:11.229 --> 01:55:11.239 align:start position:0%
edbl came in and said he kept trying to
 
01:55:14.149 --> 01:55:14.159 align:start position:0%
give a positive message but yet the
 
01:55:17.149 --> 01:55:17.159 align:start position:0%
national message was living in fear um
 
01:55:21.069 --> 01:55:21.079 align:start position:0%
and we can look at that as that affects
 
01:55:24.510 --> 01:55:24.520 align:start position:0%
the psyche of people and how they react
 
01:55:26.910 --> 01:55:26.920 align:start position:0%
and we're seeing evidence of that
 
01:55:28.550 --> 01:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
especially with the uptick of special
 
01:55:31.030 --> 01:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
education in New Hampshire um and I'm
 
01:55:32.709 --> 01:55:32.719 align:start position:0%
sure it's the same
 
01:55:35.830 --> 01:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
Nationwide uh but we can also point to a
 
01:55:37.589 --> 01:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
school that never shut down and they
 
01:55:40.470 --> 01:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
never had covid uh as we had testimony
 
01:55:42.030 --> 01:55:42.040 align:start position:0%
that was one of our first
 
01:55:47.750 --> 01:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
testimonies um so and you know probably
 
01:55:51.830 --> 01:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
a really good thing to do and it's
 
01:55:55.229 --> 01:55:55.239 align:start position:0%
because there were have limited
 
01:55:58.510 --> 01:55:58.520 align:start position:0%
time but it would be interesting to know
 
01:56:01.069 --> 01:56:01.079 align:start position:0%
what each School District did for
 
01:56:02.870 --> 01:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
mitigation and what they did with their
 
01:56:06.350 --> 01:56:06.360 align:start position:0%
funds and how they spent them we heard
 
01:56:08.950 --> 01:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
testimony here that they spent them on
 
01:56:10.430 --> 01:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
Chromebooks but the Chromebooks were
 
01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:11.470 align:start position:0%
Chromebooks but the Chromebooks were
never

01:56:11.470 --> 01:56:11.480 align:start position:0%
never
 
01:56:14.310 --> 01:56:14.320 align:start position:0%
distributed um you know did they you
 
01:56:16.870 --> 01:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
know we I've heard um from other people
 
01:56:18.669 --> 01:56:18.679 align:start position:0%
across the state that instead of putting
 
01:56:21.069 --> 01:56:21.079 align:start position:0%
in air filtration systems they spent it
 
01:56:23.069 --> 01:56:23.079 align:start position:0%
on a repair or something
 
01:56:28.069 --> 01:56:28.079 align:start position:0%
so you know these are things that I
 
01:56:32.709 --> 01:56:32.719 align:start position:0%
think really need ongoing
 
01:56:37.510 --> 01:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
investigation to see so that in the
 
01:56:40.109 --> 01:56:40.119 align:start position:0%
future there can be some sort of
 
01:56:42.830 --> 01:56:42.840 align:start position:0%
uniformity across the state instead of
 
01:56:46.350 --> 01:56:46.360 align:start position:0%
it being you know well you know we're
 
01:56:47.629 --> 01:56:47.639 align:start position:0%
going to do this with this money and
 
01:56:49.790 --> 01:56:49.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to do that because the whole
 
01:56:53.270 --> 01:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
thing was is to get people children back
 
01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:55.149 align:start position:0%
thing was is to get people children back
to

01:56:55.149 --> 01:56:55.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:56:58.030 --> 01:56:58.040 align:start position:0%
school and make it as healthy as
 
01:57:01.270 --> 01:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
possible well we know that flu season
 
01:57:03.589 --> 01:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
happens every fall we see that kids are
 
01:57:05.350 --> 01:57:05.360 align:start position:0%
going back to school the cruds going
 
01:57:07.229 --> 01:57:07.239 align:start position:0%
around everyone's starting to get sick
 
01:57:09.910 --> 01:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
and colds and everything else it's just
 
01:57:12.669 --> 01:57:12.679 align:start position:0%
the way things happen in New Hampshire
 
01:57:15.109 --> 01:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure in other states where when
 
01:57:17.510 --> 01:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
everyone goes back to school everything
 
01:57:20.270 --> 01:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
is brought home and into the public you
 
01:57:22.990 --> 01:57:23.000 align:start position:0%
know so what do we you know anything
 
01:57:24.790 --> 01:57:24.800 align:start position:0%
that we could have learned from covid
 
01:57:27.510 --> 01:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
can also help in the in those these
 
01:57:30.430 --> 01:57:30.440 align:start position:0%
circumstances going forward to help
 
01:57:33.270 --> 01:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
mitigate this so I think we have an a
 
01:57:37.629 --> 01:57:37.639 align:start position:0%
real opportunity here regarding
 
01:57:40.830 --> 01:57:40.840 align:start position:0%
that represent thank you madam chair and
 
01:57:44.870 --> 01:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
I I fully agree um with all of that I
 
01:57:47.310 --> 01:57:47.320 align:start position:0%
think most of that the proper place for
 
01:57:48.750 --> 01:57:48.760 align:start position:0%
that is going to be in the broad body of
 
01:57:51.430 --> 01:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
the report to look at really relatively
 
01:57:53.510 --> 01:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
detailed at each issue and what was done
 
01:57:58.470 --> 01:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
what wasn't done um but certainly the
 
01:58:01.589 --> 01:58:01.599 align:start position:0%
the our goal here is not just to look we
 
01:58:03.629 --> 01:58:03.639 align:start position:0%
want to also be forward looking to see
 
01:58:04.990 --> 01:58:05.000 align:start position:0%
if we can offer recommendations that
 
01:58:07.790 --> 01:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
might be helpful um within the last part
 
01:58:11.510 --> 01:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
of the summary that I've uh drafted um I
 
01:58:14.790 --> 01:58:14.800 align:start position:0%
I bring up the hypothetical that if it
 
01:58:17.069 --> 01:58:17.079 align:start position:0%
were correct that the SARS Cove 2
 
01:58:20.149 --> 01:58:20.159 align:start position:0%
pandemic had a mortality rate in the
 
01:58:24.310 --> 01:58:24.320 align:start position:0%
four to per 4 to 6% range which initial
 
01:58:26.950 --> 01:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
reports in the earliest stage of Co were
 
01:58:28.830 --> 01:58:28.840 align:start position:0%
claiming that that was the mortality
 
01:58:32.669 --> 01:58:32.679 align:start position:0%
rate um if if we had that mortality rate
 
01:58:35.069 --> 01:58:35.079 align:start position:0%
with the transmission that we saw with
 
01:58:37.310 --> 01:58:37.320 align:start position:0%
Co the extremely high R not value I
 
01:58:41.069 --> 01:58:41.079 align:start position:0%
think it was in the 6 to7 range um
 
01:58:43.589 --> 01:58:43.599 align:start position:0%
coupled with the fact that to be frank
 
01:58:47.870 --> 01:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
our state response had almost no effect
 
01:58:50.430 --> 01:58:50.440 align:start position:0%
that we could at least point to on data
 
01:58:52.830 --> 01:58:52.840 align:start position:0%
in mitigating the spread we would have
 
01:58:54.950 --> 01:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
had truly catastrophic
 
01:58:58.390 --> 01:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
circumstances um so we we do need to I
 
01:59:02.830 --> 01:59:02.840 align:start position:0%
think be giving uh advice and calling on
 
01:59:05.910 --> 01:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
the private sector and Academia
 
01:59:08.310 --> 01:59:08.320 align:start position:0%
to look
 
01:59:13.149 --> 01:59:13.159 align:start position:0%
into better ways to mitigate the spread
 
01:59:16.589 --> 01:59:16.599 align:start position:0%
of pathogens and biologics and I think
 
01:59:18.990 --> 01:59:19.000 align:start position:0%
we and I and I call for this in here
 
01:59:21.750 --> 01:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
that given the testimony we've received
 
01:59:24.629 --> 01:59:24.639 align:start position:0%
in this committee the foremost Avenue
 
01:59:27.310 --> 01:59:27.320 align:start position:0%
for seeing if we can find ways to deal
 
01:59:30.270 --> 01:59:30.280 align:start position:0%
with that should begin with engineering
 
01:59:32.149 --> 01:59:32.159 align:start position:0%
approaches and you brought up all the
 
01:59:34.310 --> 01:59:34.320 align:start position:0%
money that was spent I don't believe we
 
01:59:35.950 --> 01:59:35.960 align:start position:0%
received much testimony in this
 
01:59:39.510 --> 01:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
committee that any localities when it
 
01:59:43.870 --> 01:59:43.880 align:start position:0%
comes to schools took that large amount
 
01:59:45.790 --> 01:59:45.800 align:start position:0%
of money that they were receiving and
 
01:59:49.550 --> 01:59:49.560 align:start position:0%
made major upgrades to the engineering
 
01:59:51.350 --> 01:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
of their buildings that would have
 
01:59:56.109 --> 01:59:56.119 align:start position:0%
resulted in in um significant uh air
 
01:59:59.629 --> 01:59:59.639 align:start position:0%
exchanges um or cleaning of the air via
 
02:00:01.470 --> 02:00:01.480 align:start position:0%
any of the various agents we've heard of
 
02:00:03.669 --> 02:00:03.679 align:start position:0%
Thea UVC lighting or ozone or any of the
 
02:00:05.589 --> 02:00:05.599 align:start position:0%
other number of things that are
 
02:00:10.310 --> 02:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
available um to remove biologics from
 
02:00:13.790 --> 02:00:13.800 align:start position:0%
the air that might reduce spread and
 
02:00:16.470 --> 02:00:16.480 align:start position:0%
that as we've heard in testimony that
 
02:00:18.790 --> 02:00:18.800 align:start position:0%
really anytime there's a hazard in a
 
02:00:20.750 --> 02:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
workplace for instance under
 
02:00:23.629 --> 02:00:23.639 align:start position:0%
OSHA the first thing we'd look to do is
 
02:00:25.270 --> 02:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
well is there an engineering fix we can
 
02:00:29.109 --> 02:00:29.119 align:start position:0%
apply to this the very last thing we do
 
02:00:31.790 --> 02:00:31.800 align:start position:0%
is say is there a personal protective
 
02:00:33.950 --> 02:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
equipment approach we can take because a
 
02:00:35.950 --> 02:00:35.960 align:start position:0%
personal protective equipment approach
 
02:00:38.350 --> 02:00:38.360 align:start position:0%
first of all it relies on a high degree
 
02:00:42.390 --> 02:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
of Competency and following of really
 
02:00:44.390 --> 02:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
technical directions by the person
 
02:00:47.189 --> 02:00:47.199 align:start position:0%
utilizing the PPE and I can say that as
 
02:00:48.990 --> 02:00:49.000 align:start position:0%
an exp paramedic I had to go through fit
 
02:00:53.430 --> 02:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
testing and all of this other stuff um
 
02:00:56.390 --> 02:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
and it's not something that everybody in
 
02:00:57.589 --> 02:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
the public is just going to be able to
 
02:00:59.830 --> 02:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
immediately adopt so we always look to
 
02:01:02.390 --> 02:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
engineering protocols first to see if we
 
02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:03.229 align:start position:0%
engineering protocols first to see if we
can

02:01:03.229 --> 02:01:03.239 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:01:08.149 --> 02:01:08.159 align:start position:0%
control um the the threat and that that
 
02:01:10.910 --> 02:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
seems to have been the last thing that
 
02:01:13.550 --> 02:01:13.560 align:start position:0%
was looked at during the pandemic we we
 
02:01:16.390 --> 02:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
jumped right into personal protective
 
02:01:18.830 --> 02:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
equipment and just kind of jumped over
 
02:01:22.109 --> 02:01:22.119 align:start position:0%
the the engineering approaches to uh to
 
02:01:23.870 --> 02:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
deal with the problem and I I I don't
 
02:01:26.709 --> 02:01:26.719 align:start position:0%
know if I have a good answer as to why
 
02:01:29.189 --> 02:01:29.199 align:start position:0%
that happened but it does seem that it
 
02:01:31.069 --> 02:01:31.079 align:start position:0%
happened and we really need to flip that
 
02:01:35.270 --> 02:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
Paradigm and look first to engineering
 
02:01:38.109 --> 02:01:38.119 align:start position:0%
approaches you know I I agree with you I
 
02:01:40.830 --> 02:01:40.840 align:start position:0%
mean I think that I think that it's one
 
02:01:42.350 --> 02:01:42.360 align:start position:0%
of the things that one of the first
 
02:01:44.430 --> 02:01:44.440 align:start position:0%
things we learned in this committee that
 
02:01:46.350 --> 02:01:46.360 align:start position:0%
was overlooked that we would have just
 
02:01:52.550 --> 02:01:52.560 align:start position:0%
taken for granted um and I think
 
02:01:54.669 --> 02:01:54.679 align:start position:0%
that government entities they get
 
02:01:57.149 --> 02:01:57.159 align:start position:0%
sometimes bogged down and they don't
 
02:01:59.229 --> 02:01:59.239 align:start position:0%
look at that and that's why this report
 
02:02:02.589 --> 02:02:02.599 align:start position:0%
I think will be so important is so that
 
02:02:04.750 --> 02:02:04.760 align:start position:0%
it'll give them kind of a guideline on
 
02:02:07.229 --> 02:02:07.239 align:start position:0%
what to look at in the future uh we
 
02:02:09.350 --> 02:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
heard testimony that really the target
 
02:02:11.790 --> 02:02:11.800 align:start position:0%
people for getting Co was the elderly
 
02:02:15.350 --> 02:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
anyone over 70 um children were really
 
02:02:19.870 --> 02:02:19.880 align:start position:0%
at no risk um for covid um and still to
 
02:02:22.629 --> 02:02:22.639 align:start position:0%
this day I I believe that's uh
 
02:02:27.470 --> 02:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
true so you know we shutting down the
 
02:02:30.510 --> 02:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
school systems I understand some people
 
02:02:32.629 --> 02:02:32.639 align:start position:0%
teachers but the majority of your people
 
02:02:36.109 --> 02:02:36.119 align:start position:0%
in the school system are the children um
 
02:02:37.990 --> 02:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
so that begs the question but yet we
 
02:02:40.310 --> 02:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
could still certain people could still
 
02:02:42.790 --> 02:02:42.800 align:start position:0%
go to work I was one of those that had
 
02:02:47.069 --> 02:02:47.079 align:start position:0%
to go to work every day um I you know we
 
02:02:49.669 --> 02:02:49.679 align:start position:0%
all went to the grocery stores you know
 
02:02:51.830 --> 02:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
we all there were things that we just
 
02:02:53.470 --> 02:02:53.480 align:start position:0%
just had to keep doing in our daily
 
02:02:56.270 --> 02:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
lives to in you know interact with the
 
02:02:59.510 --> 02:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
public um so we need to be you know that
 
02:03:03.030 --> 02:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
is one of those things but I think you
 
02:03:04.870 --> 02:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
know that you're correct that the
 
02:03:08.550 --> 02:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
engineering protocols were really uh you
 
02:03:10.669 --> 02:03:10.679 align:start position:0%
know down on the list I don't know where
 
02:03:15.229 --> 02:03:15.239 align:start position:0%
but it wasn't the first priority um so
 
02:03:17.990 --> 02:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
but I think that's something that we've
 
02:03:19.589 --> 02:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
learned and I think that in the future
 
02:03:20.950 --> 02:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
that should be something and as we
 
02:03:23.109 --> 02:03:23.119 align:start position:0%
discussed uh another thing that needs to
 
02:03:25.229 --> 02:03:25.239 align:start position:0%
be looked at in the future in talking
 
02:03:29.430 --> 02:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
with I believe it was uh Dr Koff was
 
02:03:30.910 --> 02:03:30.920 align:start position:0%
that we need to be looking at the
 
02:03:32.229 --> 02:03:32.239 align:start position:0%
population that's going to be most
 
02:03:33.790 --> 02:03:33.800 align:start position:0%
effective because so maybe that
 
02:03:35.669 --> 02:03:35.679 align:start position:0%
population is the one that needs to be
 
02:03:38.430 --> 02:03:38.440 align:start position:0%
secluded and stay home uh
 
02:03:42.189 --> 02:03:42.199 align:start position:0%
versus everyone um and maybe in the
 
02:03:44.669 --> 02:03:44.679 align:start position:0%
beginning everyone was a good approach
 
02:03:45.870 --> 02:03:45.880 align:start position:0%
because they didn't know what they were
 
02:03:49.390 --> 02:03:49.400 align:start position:0%
dealing with But as time progressed we
 
02:03:50.270 --> 02:03:50.280 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
02:03:54.069 --> 02:03:54.079 align:start position:0%
knew what was going on um and to take
 
02:03:55.990 --> 02:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
the approach where we're going to make
 
02:03:57.350 --> 02:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
this decision we're going to stay the
 
02:04:00.270 --> 02:04:00.280 align:start position:0%
course no matter what the data presents
 
02:04:02.510 --> 02:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
I don't believe was the correct
 
02:04:04.950 --> 02:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
approach I represent
 
02:04:08.669 --> 02:04:08.679 align:start position:0%
wey yeah I I think that's you bring up a
 
02:04:11.870 --> 02:04:11.880 align:start position:0%
really good point Madam chair uh is that
 
02:04:11.880 --> 02:04:12.629 align:start position:0%
really good point Madam chair uh is that
I

02:04:12.629 --> 02:04:12.639 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:04:16.709 --> 02:04:16.719 align:start position:0%
think um if I remember correctly part of
 
02:04:20.470 --> 02:04:20.480 align:start position:0%
the uh fatality rate was really
 
02:04:22.830 --> 02:04:22.840 align:start position:0%
associated with multiple
 
02:04:25.390 --> 02:04:25.400 align:start position:0%
comorbidities in other words adverse
 
02:04:28.990 --> 02:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
health conditions not just one or you
 
02:04:33.589 --> 02:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
but two or three that it was those
 
02:04:38.709 --> 02:04:38.719 align:start position:0%
people who um were more subject to uh
 
02:04:41.030 --> 02:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
potential fatality we don't know what to
 
02:04:44.390 --> 02:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
what extent that was exacerbated by the
 
02:04:49.229 --> 02:04:49.239 align:start position:0%
uh the ventilators or uh uh at and there
 
02:04:50.910 --> 02:04:50.920 align:start position:0%
are still some you know other other
 
02:04:52.830 --> 02:04:52.840 align:start position:0%
drugs that are
 
02:04:55.709 --> 02:04:55.719 align:start position:0%
suspect um in the treat in the treatment
 
02:04:59.589 --> 02:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
and how whether or not they were uh that
 
02:05:02.629 --> 02:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
efficacious we really still don't know
 
02:05:04.790 --> 02:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
because they're still under emergency
 
02:05:07.709 --> 02:05:07.719 align:start position:0%
use authorization so we really don't
 
02:05:12.310 --> 02:05:12.320 align:start position:0%
know how effective they are um so uh
 
02:05:15.910 --> 02:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
other than uh some anecdotal um and
 
02:05:15.920 --> 02:05:18.109 align:start position:0%
other than uh some anecdotal um and
maybe

02:05:18.109 --> 02:05:18.119 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
02:05:21.270 --> 02:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
um some general evidence that is
 
02:05:23.790 --> 02:05:23.800 align:start position:0%
available but so I
 
02:05:26.589 --> 02:05:26.599 align:start position:0%
I I I think the you know the engineering
 
02:05:29.830 --> 02:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
approach sounds good I think really just
 
02:05:33.149 --> 02:05:33.159 align:start position:0%
a a focus on better
 
02:05:36.629 --> 02:05:36.639 align:start position:0%
understanding the population affected
 
02:05:39.310 --> 02:05:39.320 align:start position:0%
and then responding to that in the
 
02:05:42.830 --> 02:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
engineering mode um and I'm also
 
02:05:45.149 --> 02:05:45.159 align:start position:0%
concerned uh you know we've talked
 
02:05:48.069 --> 02:05:48.079 align:start position:0%
earlier about the psychological aspects
 
02:05:53.549 --> 02:05:53.559 align:start position:0%
but you know the the idea of
 
02:05:56.990 --> 02:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
um you I'm sure I've heard it but you
 
02:05:59.910 --> 02:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
know either you know taking measures
 
02:06:02.109 --> 02:06:02.119 align:start position:0%
that were required so that you don't
 
02:06:04.310 --> 02:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
kill grandmaa or
 
02:06:07.589 --> 02:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
grandpa um you know and putting that in
 
02:06:10.470 --> 02:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
front of the children really putting I
 
02:06:13.709 --> 02:06:13.719 align:start position:0%
think a psychological burden on them
 
02:06:13.719 --> 02:06:16.549 align:start position:0%
think a psychological burden on them
that

02:06:16.549 --> 02:06:16.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:06:19.830 --> 02:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
um who knows what damage that uh has
 
02:06:23.549 --> 02:06:23.559 align:start position:0%
caused so thank you right especially if
 
02:06:26.390 --> 02:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
something did happen to them uh and they
 
02:06:33.870 --> 02:06:33.880 align:start position:0%
were you know it's it's it's not good so
 
02:06:37.589 --> 02:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
uh so I think um so what does everyone
 
02:06:39.510 --> 02:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
think so far I mean these are some
 
02:06:41.149 --> 02:06:41.159 align:start position:0%
really good points in this outline I
 
02:06:45.549 --> 02:06:45.559 align:start position:0%
think that uh is a good start for us um
 
02:06:48.470 --> 02:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
to start going forward um and I also
 
02:06:50.830 --> 02:06:50.840 align:start position:0%
think you know you know like you said
 
02:06:52.189 --> 02:06:52.199 align:start position:0%
one of the things we need to be looking
 
02:06:55.149 --> 02:06:55.159 align:start position:0%
at is what we need to you know we'll
 
02:06:57.589 --> 02:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
give the report on the data that we've
 
02:07:00.149 --> 02:07:00.159 align:start position:0%
received but also the data that we
 
02:07:02.950 --> 02:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
receive that in the future if there's
 
02:07:05.350 --> 02:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
another pandemic uh that should be
 
02:07:07.549 --> 02:07:07.559 align:start position:0%
addressed I mean we heard some testimony
 
02:07:09.149 --> 02:07:09.159 align:start position:0%
here and we had a great discussion in
 
02:07:13.350 --> 02:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
the committee that um all parties should
 
02:07:16.109 --> 02:07:16.119 align:start position:0%
be involved uh you need to have people
 
02:07:18.790 --> 02:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
that don't agree with you involved in
 
02:07:21.510 --> 02:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
the discussions uh it can't be every
 
02:07:24.069 --> 02:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
everyone that's on the same page because
 
02:07:27.470 --> 02:07:27.480 align:start position:0%
if you want a true to get to
 
02:07:30.990 --> 02:07:31.000 align:start position:0%
the to solve the problem you need to
 
02:07:33.270 --> 02:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
have different viewpoints to really get
 
02:07:36.270 --> 02:07:36.280 align:start position:0%
to the bottom of things um I think
 
02:07:39.109 --> 02:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
that's one thing real solutions happen
 
02:07:40.790 --> 02:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
and I think we had a great discussion
 
02:07:46.189 --> 02:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
about that here um and I represent
 
02:07:48.270 --> 02:07:48.280 align:start position:0%
belill thank you madam chair and just to
 
02:07:50.870 --> 02:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
to round it out the last section that I
 
02:07:52.589 --> 02:07:52.599 align:start position:0%
I put in here for people to our
 
02:07:56.709 --> 02:07:56.719 align:start position:0%
consideration um it references the AAR
 
02:07:58.390 --> 02:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
or the after action report that was
 
02:07:59.750 --> 02:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
commissioned by the executive I don't
 
02:08:01.870 --> 02:08:01.880 align:start position:0%
know exactly how to put where to put
 
02:08:03.270 --> 02:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
this in the report yet we'll have to
 
02:08:06.310 --> 02:08:06.320 align:start position:0%
look at it but I I just want to address
 
02:08:09.109 --> 02:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
that there are certainly some things I
 
02:08:10.470 --> 02:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
hope we had a lot more time to talk
 
02:08:12.390 --> 02:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
about that report in some detail in the
 
02:08:13.790 --> 02:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
committee maybe maybe we have a day or
 
02:08:15.790 --> 02:08:15.800 align:start position:0%
an afternoon or something for it um that
 
02:08:20.629 --> 02:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
would be great however there is limited
 
02:08:23.629 --> 02:08:23.639 align:start position:0%
utility in the report for us then while
 
02:08:25.270 --> 02:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
there's information information that's
 
02:08:28.470 --> 02:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
interesting we can draw from
 
02:08:32.790 --> 02:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
uh ultimately the nature of the report
 
02:08:36.270 --> 02:08:36.280 align:start position:0%
is such that it was a survey
 
02:08:38.790 --> 02:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
questionnaire to various persons
 
02:08:41.990 --> 02:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
identified as as being uh quote unquote
 
02:08:45.470 --> 02:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
stakeholders um and it it asked
 
02:08:48.030 --> 02:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
questions of them like do they believe
 
02:08:50.069 --> 02:08:50.079 align:start position:0%
this thing or how do they feel about
 
02:08:53.950 --> 02:08:53.960 align:start position:0%
this thing um um and because of the
 
02:08:55.669 --> 02:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
manner in which it pursued these
 
02:08:57.149 --> 02:08:57.159 align:start position:0%
questions the population that it was
 
02:08:59.189 --> 02:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
chosen from was not at random it was it
 
02:09:00.709 --> 02:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
was a particular population that was
 
02:09:04.549 --> 02:09:04.559 align:start position:0%
asked these questions um and because our
 
02:09:08.669 --> 02:09:08.679 align:start position:0%
mission as a committee is truly to be
 
02:09:12.830 --> 02:09:12.840 align:start position:0%
science-based in fact finding um most of
 
02:09:15.390 --> 02:09:15.400 align:start position:0%
this report the a is simply not science
 
02:09:17.830 --> 02:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
based so we can't rely too much on on
 
02:09:23.750 --> 02:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:23.760 --> 02:09:24.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:09:24.870 --> 02:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:28.030 --> 02:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
so I agree we need to have a discussion
 
02:09:30.830 --> 02:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
uh about that report um I have reached
 
02:09:33.870 --> 02:09:33.880 align:start position:0%
out to director boxton to see if he is
 
02:09:36.870 --> 02:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
available although we have limited time
 
02:09:39.669 --> 02:09:39.679 align:start position:0%
um so it may be that we have to have
 
02:09:42.390 --> 02:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
that discussion about that report just
 
02:09:42.400 --> 02:09:43.470 align:start position:0%
that discussion about that report just
amongst

02:09:43.470 --> 02:09:43.480 align:start position:0%
amongst
 
02:09:46.750 --> 02:09:46.760 align:start position:0%
ourselves um and maybe next Friday may
 
02:09:49.750 --> 02:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
be the day that we uh do that if I don't
 
02:09:54.390 --> 02:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
hear from him for another day date um so
 
02:09:57.189 --> 02:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
if anyone has objections with
 
02:10:01.149 --> 02:10:01.159 align:start position:0%
that um I do have somebody else I'd like
 
02:10:05.270 --> 02:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
to bring in uh to uh testify in front of
 
02:10:07.390 --> 02:10:07.400 align:start position:0%
this committee uh who has been seeing
 
02:10:09.030 --> 02:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
patients that should be getting better
 
02:10:11.430 --> 02:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
and aren't
 
02:10:14.669 --> 02:10:14.679 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know what his availability
 
02:10:17.830 --> 02:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
is yet um but I'm going to try and reach
 
02:10:21.350 --> 02:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
out to him to come in here uh because
 
02:10:26.510 --> 02:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
obviously as a doctor um you know he can
 
02:10:29.310 --> 02:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
give us some insight and I think having
 
02:10:32.229 --> 02:10:32.239 align:start position:0%
Insight from a doctor that sees
 
02:10:34.229 --> 02:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
particular patients I mean not that's
 
02:10:38.109 --> 02:10:38.119 align:start position:0%
not his only patient based but yeah so
 
02:10:39.790 --> 02:10:39.800 align:start position:0%
um if anyone else has anyone that they
 
02:10:43.589 --> 02:10:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:46.510 --> 02:10:46.520 align:start position:0%
um uh I think we've heard from a lot of
 
02:10:49.910 --> 02:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
stakeholders Dr Chan will be coming
 
02:10:52.310 --> 02:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
in um
 
02:10:54.790 --> 02:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
and I mean I would love to hear from the
 
02:10:57.790 --> 02:10:57.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor but we just don't
 
02:11:00.910 --> 02:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
have the time to go that's another
 
02:11:04.310 --> 02:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
whole uh issue um you know the scope of
 
02:11:06.669 --> 02:11:06.679 align:start position:0%
this we have to we have to find you know
 
02:11:09.310 --> 02:11:09.320 align:start position:0%
kind of find it you know narrow it down
 
02:11:11.069 --> 02:11:11.079 align:start position:0%
because otherwise we could get in over
 
02:11:11.079 --> 02:11:12.709 align:start position:0%
because otherwise we could get in over
our

02:11:12.709 --> 02:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:11:16.990 --> 02:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
heads um but representative
 
02:11:22.030 --> 02:11:22.040 align:start position:0%
weary well I I think um I'm sure
 
02:11:24.950 --> 02:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
this report will include this but I
 
02:11:27.589 --> 02:11:27.599 align:start position:0%
there are it's probably a list of
 
02:11:30.189 --> 02:11:30.199 align:start position:0%
questions still to be answered right uh
 
02:11:33.069 --> 02:11:33.079 align:start position:0%
something that that would be you know
 
02:11:35.870 --> 02:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
not that you know I want to extend
 
02:11:37.830 --> 02:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
committee time more than is necessary
 
02:11:42.109 --> 02:11:42.119 align:start position:0%
but I think uh and and and but just to
 
02:11:44.149 --> 02:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
identify other topics that really should
 
02:11:46.310 --> 02:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
be addressed and uh
 
02:11:49.470 --> 02:11:49.480 align:start position:0%
investigated um on an ongoing
 
02:11:52.109 --> 02:11:52.119 align:start position:0%
basis uh so
 
02:11:54.470 --> 02:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
that on the whole New Hampshire is
 
02:11:57.430 --> 02:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
better prepared to handle this the next
 
02:11:59.390 --> 02:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
time because unless we get some of those
 
02:12:01.910 --> 02:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
questions addressed in the interim
 
02:12:04.390 --> 02:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
before this occurs again then the
 
02:12:06.709 --> 02:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
likelihood of us being able
 
02:12:11.589 --> 02:12:11.599 align:start position:0%
to um properly respond uh in in all
 
02:12:14.870 --> 02:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
facets and to really develop uh if if
 
02:12:16.549 --> 02:12:16.559 align:start position:0%
you'll part in the mixed metaphor and
 
02:12:21.870 --> 02:12:21.880 align:start position:0%
effective swiss cheese um we then uh um
 
02:12:24.549 --> 02:12:24.559 align:start position:0%
we we really won't you know we'll we'll
 
02:12:26.510 --> 02:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
be at a deficit again and I I think
 
02:12:26.520 --> 02:12:29.189 align:start position:0%
be at a deficit again and I I think
that's

02:12:29.189 --> 02:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:12:31.790 --> 02:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
um you know we're we're identifying the
 
02:12:34.669 --> 02:12:34.679 align:start position:0%
report is identifying the efficacy of
 
02:12:40.470 --> 02:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
these um actions that were taken uh
 
02:12:43.510 --> 02:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
but and and making a determination about
 
02:12:45.069 --> 02:12:45.079 align:start position:0%
whether or not they were effective but I
 
02:12:49.589 --> 02:12:49.599 align:start position:0%
think we we ultimately have to uh try to
 
02:12:52.669 --> 02:12:52.679 align:start position:0%
point the legis Lor
 
02:12:55.470 --> 02:12:55.480 align:start position:0%
legisl and other departments
 
02:12:58.709 --> 02:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
into methodologies that will be
 
02:13:00.629 --> 02:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
effective for the next pandemic whenever
 
02:13:03.910 --> 02:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
that should arise so thank
 
02:13:06.030 --> 02:13:06.040 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
02:13:08.870 --> 02:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
belch thank you madam chair and yes the
 
02:13:10.470 --> 02:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
the manner in which I sort of envisioned
 
02:13:13.910 --> 02:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
the report taking a format would be sort
 
02:13:16.390 --> 02:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
of a topical and subtopic so different
 
02:13:18.470 --> 02:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
topical sections each one with different
 
02:13:22.510 --> 02:13:22.520 align:start position:0%
subtopics within each subtopic the the
 
02:13:24.390 --> 02:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
summary of the totality of evidence and
 
02:13:27.229 --> 02:13:27.239 align:start position:0%
testimonies that we've received would be
 
02:13:32.030 --> 02:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
outlined um followed up by a a basic
 
02:13:35.270 --> 02:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
factual analysis to say okay this is
 
02:13:37.629 --> 02:13:37.639 align:start position:0%
this is what we received this is what
 
02:13:40.510 --> 02:13:40.520 align:start position:0%
the facts show as far as well I mean
 
02:13:41.870 --> 02:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
everyone caught
 
02:13:45.149 --> 02:13:45.159 align:start position:0%
covid did that work well if the if the
 
02:13:46.669 --> 02:13:46.679 align:start position:0%
point of it was to have people not Catch
 
02:13:49.549 --> 02:13:49.559 align:start position:0%
Co then obviously it didn't work but
 
02:13:52.189 --> 02:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
everything would be subject to a
 
02:13:54.270 --> 02:13:54.280 align:start position:0%
again a summary of the totality of data
 
02:13:57.390 --> 02:13:57.400 align:start position:0%
a brief analysis um including anything
 
02:13:59.470 --> 02:13:59.480 align:start position:0%
that we may that may be disputed or that
 
02:14:03.270 --> 02:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
we may not be sure on um and then
 
02:14:09.270 --> 02:14:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:12.149 --> 02:14:12.159 align:start position:0%
item represent P
 
02:14:15.750 --> 02:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
off uh on on a question uh is there
 
02:14:18.709 --> 02:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
anyone else uh we would like to hear
 
02:14:22.390 --> 02:14:22.400 align:start position:0%
from uh on uh some of our first meetings
 
02:14:25.910 --> 02:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh from audience we were monitored by
 
02:14:28.189 --> 02:14:28.199 align:start position:0%
representative from New Hampshire
 
02:14:31.310 --> 02:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
Hospital Association so it would be
 
02:14:34.430 --> 02:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
interesting to hear from hospitals their
 
02:14:38.430 --> 02:14:38.440 align:start position:0%
view on how Co response was happening in
 
02:14:41.310 --> 02:14:41.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospitals I don't know if
 
02:14:44.350 --> 02:14:44.360 align:start position:0%
it's possible and if I may take couple
 
02:14:51.030 --> 02:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
minutes uh um um uh we had the repr
 
02:14:53.709 --> 02:14:53.719 align:start position:0%
reprentative from uh Children Health
 
02:14:56.870 --> 02:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
defense today and earlier this
 
02:15:00.750 --> 02:15:00.760 align:start position:0%
organization released documentary called
 
02:15:05.229 --> 02:15:05.239 align:start position:0%
Vex 3 authorized to kill so uh I was
 
02:15:07.750 --> 02:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
able to watch it in New Hampshire
 
02:15:11.149 --> 02:15:11.159 align:start position:0%
Cinema and I would recommend if you ever
 
02:15:14.270 --> 02:15:14.280 align:start position:0%
have like couple hours to spend to to
 
02:15:18.709 --> 02:15:18.719 align:start position:0%
watch uh uh Vex three uh authorized to
 
02:15:22.069 --> 02:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
kill documentary and uh uh it will be
 
02:15:26.830 --> 02:15:26.840 align:start position:0%
released to public early next months uh
 
02:15:32.149 --> 02:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
for free uh and um uh obviously they
 
02:15:34.910 --> 02:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
they filmed uh if you know about them
 
02:15:37.109 --> 02:15:37.119 align:start position:0%
they filmed some people who didn't
 
02:15:39.470 --> 02:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
receive covid vaccine and uh lived
 
02:15:43.430 --> 02:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
through Co fine through infection and
 
02:15:46.629 --> 02:15:46.639 align:start position:0%
they filmed some people who had some uh
 
02:15:49.270 --> 02:15:49.280 align:start position:0%
other relatives had some severe side
 
02:15:51.629 --> 02:15:51.639 align:start position:0%
effects after receiving Co vaccine but
 
02:15:57.549 --> 02:15:57.559 align:start position:0%
they went uh to uh as places regarding
 
02:16:01.109 --> 02:16:01.119 align:start position:0%
uh covid protocols and it's something I
 
02:16:04.030 --> 02:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
don't know how deep we can uh go into it
 
02:16:07.390 --> 02:16:07.400 align:start position:0%
because like new facts are are being
 
02:16:07.400 --> 02:16:08.870 align:start position:0%
because like new facts are are being
surfaced

02:16:08.870 --> 02:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
surfaced
 
02:16:12.470 --> 02:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe it shows the need to similar
 
02:16:16.669 --> 02:16:16.679 align:start position:0%
committee being formed uh next year uh
 
02:16:19.790 --> 02:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
today and in our previous meetings we
 
02:16:22.790 --> 02:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
already discussed this overlay
 
02:16:24.549 --> 02:16:24.559 align:start position:0%
aggressive uh
 
02:16:29.669 --> 02:16:29.679 align:start position:0%
ventilations uh that was oxygen ventilat
 
02:16:34.270 --> 02:16:34.280 align:start position:0%
uh um being applied overly aggressively
 
02:16:34.280 --> 02:16:35.309 align:start position:0%
uh um being applied overly aggressively
and

02:16:35.309 --> 02:16:35.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:16:37.830 --> 02:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
eventually it was shown
 
02:16:40.910 --> 02:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
that it will be more beneficial to
 
02:16:45.469 --> 02:16:45.479 align:start position:0%
survivors not to apply it on early
 
02:16:49.230 --> 02:16:49.240 align:start position:0%
stages as aggressively but uh what the
 
02:16:53.669 --> 02:16:53.679 align:start position:0%
documentary showed that there are many
 
02:16:53.679 --> 02:16:56.150 align:start position:0%
documentary showed that there are many
other

02:16:56.150 --> 02:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:17:00.070 --> 02:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
questionable uh uh Pro things in Co
 
02:17:02.070 --> 02:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
protocols that were
 
02:17:05.150 --> 02:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
implemented like uh one of allegation
 
02:17:08.950 --> 02:17:08.960 align:start position:0%
that assumption was that people uh
 
02:17:12.709 --> 02:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
experiencing a covid infection and
 
02:17:12.719 --> 02:17:15.070 align:start position:0%
experiencing a covid infection and
disease

02:17:15.070 --> 02:17:15.080 align:start position:0%
disease
 
02:17:21.030 --> 02:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
um uh respond negatively to uh liquids
 
02:17:25.110 --> 02:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
uh to to to drinking water so patients
 
02:17:25.120 --> 02:17:26.469 align:start position:0%
uh to to to drinking water so patients
were

02:17:26.469 --> 02:17:26.479 align:start position:0%
were
 
02:17:30.070 --> 02:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
limited in the amount of water they were
 
02:17:32.110 --> 02:17:32.120 align:start position:0%
allowed to drink even if they were
 
02:17:34.509 --> 02:17:34.519 align:start position:0%
begging for water and it was happening
 
02:17:37.830 --> 02:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
for days and eventually apparently it
 
02:17:41.190 --> 02:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
was negatively affecting them especially
 
02:17:44.150 --> 02:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
when they were on a
 
02:17:47.110 --> 02:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
multiple of other medications sometimes
 
02:17:50.030 --> 02:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
dozens of medications sometimes uh
 
02:17:54.870 --> 02:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
including opiates like we all hear about
 
02:17:58.910 --> 02:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
uh fentol uh this in New Hampshire but
 
02:18:00.950 --> 02:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
some of the covid patients were
 
02:18:04.150 --> 02:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
receiving the same medication as as
 
02:18:08.429 --> 02:18:08.439 align:start position:0%
treatment but protocols
 
02:18:13.790 --> 02:18:13.800 align:start position:0%
were allegedly not beneficial uh to
 
02:18:17.349 --> 02:18:17.359 align:start position:0%
people at least in in some
 
02:18:22.750 --> 02:18:22.760 align:start position:0%
circumstances uh so and similar like
 
02:18:27.589 --> 02:18:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh there's some discussion about V REM
 
02:18:31.549 --> 02:18:31.559 align:start position:0%
being uh uh at least some portions of it
 
02:18:34.270 --> 02:18:34.280 align:start position:0%
being removed from market for unrelated
 
02:18:36.870 --> 02:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
reasons but there were some initial
 
02:18:39.750 --> 02:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
safety concerns about the drug when it
 
02:18:42.549 --> 02:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
was initially tested in Africa and
 
02:18:45.709 --> 02:18:45.719 align:start position:0%
showed High mortality and there some
 
02:18:49.469 --> 02:18:49.479 align:start position:0%
allegations uh of uh that we heard uh in
 
02:18:52.669 --> 02:18:52.679 align:start position:0%
testimonies about increased level of
 
02:18:54.190 --> 02:18:54.200 align:start position:0%
acute renal
 
02:18:58.790 --> 02:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
failure and um basically if it's
 
02:18:58.800 --> 02:19:01.389 align:start position:0%
failure and um basically if it's
antiviral

02:19:01.389 --> 02:19:01.399 align:start position:0%
antiviral
 
02:19:06.309 --> 02:19:06.319 align:start position:0%
drug it it makes sense uh to take it for
 
02:19:09.549 --> 02:19:09.559 align:start position:0%
certain period when virus is replicating
 
02:19:13.230 --> 02:19:13.240 align:start position:0%
in the body on later stages of diseases
 
02:19:16.429 --> 02:19:16.439 align:start position:0%
if virus is already not replicating or
 
02:19:19.349 --> 02:19:19.359 align:start position:0%
if it's already stopped by this or other
 
02:19:23.230 --> 02:19:23.240 align:start position:0%
drugs uh it's probably counterproductive
 
02:19:26.950 --> 02:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
to keep uh giving the drug for days and
 
02:19:29.509 --> 02:19:29.519 align:start position:0%
days and days and days especially even
 
02:19:32.709 --> 02:19:32.719 align:start position:0%
if insert for the drug uh specifically
 
02:19:34.309 --> 02:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
states that
 
02:19:37.830 --> 02:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
prolonged consumption of the drug uh
 
02:19:42.830 --> 02:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
leads to certain uh side effects so uh
 
02:19:46.990 --> 02:19:47.000 align:start position:0%
there are multiple allegations about Co
 
02:19:50.790 --> 02:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
protocols that were used uh in uh
 
02:19:55.309 --> 02:19:55.319 align:start position:0%
treating people with co uh who was
 
02:19:58.469 --> 02:19:58.479 align:start position:0%
hospitalized and uh it would be
 
02:20:00.590 --> 02:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
interesting to see like how that
 
02:20:05.270 --> 02:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
practice was uh uh introduced evaluated
 
02:20:08.790 --> 02:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
for Effectiveness and safety and how
 
02:20:11.910 --> 02:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
it's currently implemented or not
 
02:20:14.870 --> 02:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
implemented in New Hampshire hospitals
 
02:20:18.349 --> 02:20:18.359 align:start position:0%
thank you uh just a quick qu question on
 
02:20:20.950 --> 02:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
the documentary um sounds very very
 
02:20:24.750 --> 02:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
interesting did they have uh information
 
02:20:27.389 --> 02:20:27.399 align:start position:0%
at the end of it to corroborate where
 
02:20:29.150 --> 02:20:29.160 align:start position:0%
they're getting where they documented
 
02:20:32.590 --> 02:20:32.600 align:start position:0%
that information so that we could uh see
 
02:20:38.230 --> 02:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:41.510 --> 02:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
know I don't know if it's like 100% but
 
02:20:42.510 --> 02:20:42.520 align:start position:0%
there are
 
02:20:45.670 --> 02:20:45.680 align:start position:0%
definitely references to official
 
02:20:50.070 --> 02:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
documents like FDA inserts and uh
 
02:20:53.910 --> 02:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
research and uh it's a mixture like uh
 
02:20:56.230 --> 02:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
they have some anecdotal evidences but
 
02:20:59.550 --> 02:20:59.560 align:start position:0%
they also have uh medical professionals
 
02:21:02.630 --> 02:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh uh testifying in in the
 
02:21:05.670 --> 02:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
documentary okay um when that becomes
 
02:21:07.790 --> 02:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
public or whatever could you send that
 
02:21:10.270 --> 02:21:10.280 align:start position:0%
to the committee and uh if anyone so
 
02:21:12.630 --> 02:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
chooses then they can watch it I mean it
 
02:21:13.910 --> 02:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
sounds like it's not going to be out
 
02:21:18.110 --> 02:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
until after our report but um I I I
 
02:21:20.309 --> 02:21:20.319 align:start position:0%
think uh it oh you're talking October
 
02:21:21.830 --> 02:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking I'm already thinking we're
 
02:21:24.349 --> 02:21:24.359 align:start position:0%
next month is
 
02:21:27.630 --> 02:21:27.640 align:start position:0%
Noob representative Merchant good
 
02:21:30.110 --> 02:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
afternoon my apologies for being late I
 
02:21:31.870 --> 02:21:31.880 align:start position:0%
was at another meeting as well and I may
 
02:21:33.349 --> 02:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
have to leave this one relatively soon
 
02:21:36.030 --> 02:21:36.040 align:start position:0%
as well in regards to the report I want
 
02:21:37.950 --> 02:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
to be sure the
 
02:21:40.950 --> 02:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
committee is mindful of its charge and
 
02:21:43.670 --> 02:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
it's to evaluate the state's response to
 
02:21:47.150 --> 02:21:47.160 align:start position:0%
the covid not to evaluate Co itself or
 
02:21:50.110 --> 02:21:50.120 align:start position:0%
evaluate the merits and so forth of the
 
02:21:50.120 --> 02:21:51.469 align:start position:0%
evaluate the merits and so forth of the
vaccine

02:21:51.469 --> 02:21:51.479 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
02:21:54.110 --> 02:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
um I would go back and say at what time
 
02:21:57.990 --> 02:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:00.429 --> 02:22:00.439 align:start position:0%
available how that information was
 
02:22:02.510 --> 02:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
utilized and talking about some of the
 
02:22:04.510 --> 02:22:04.520 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that was available to the
 
02:22:08.750 --> 02:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
state to respond to it but be careful
 
02:22:10.469 --> 02:22:10.479 align:start position:0%
about going down into a different path
 
02:22:12.910 --> 02:22:12.920 align:start position:0%
and off the tangents dealing with the
 
02:22:14.830 --> 02:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
efficacy of the vaccine the approval the
 
02:22:16.110 --> 02:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
vaccine at the federal level and so
 
02:22:18.389 --> 02:22:18.399 align:start position:0%
forth that to me is beyond the scope of
 
02:22:20.550 --> 02:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
what our charges so I'd like to be sure
 
02:22:24.110 --> 02:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
we narrow down to what our charge is in
 
02:22:26.150 --> 02:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
our report so we stay within the
 
02:22:27.950 --> 02:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
guidelines that were
 
02:22:30.270 --> 02:22:30.280 align:start position:0%
given uh I don't know if you've had a
 
02:22:32.230 --> 02:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
chance but representative belter just
 
02:22:34.270 --> 02:22:34.280 align:start position:0%
sent out kind of like a draft to the
 
02:22:37.270 --> 02:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
committee of what he was thinking and he
 
02:22:39.150 --> 02:22:39.160 align:start position:0%
kind of presents things that were
 
02:22:41.510 --> 02:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
presented to us
 
02:22:41.520 --> 02:22:43.150 align:start position:0%
presented to us
specifically

02:22:43.150 --> 02:22:43.160 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
02:22:46.950 --> 02:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
um so and then discusses some other
 
02:22:49.230 --> 02:22:49.240 align:start position:0%
things and before you got here we were
 
02:22:51.510 --> 02:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
discussing some the things that we
 
02:22:53.990 --> 02:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
learned that maybe in the future during
 
02:22:55.590 --> 02:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
another pandemic that the state should
 
02:22:58.190 --> 02:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
be looking at um that they didn't look
 
02:23:01.990 --> 02:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
at so I think that's
 
02:23:05.070 --> 02:23:05.080 align:start position:0%
important representative Bel uh thank
 
02:23:07.389 --> 02:23:07.399 align:start position:0%
you madam chair just just to respond to
 
02:23:09.349 --> 02:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
um the matter of of vaccines but I'm
 
02:23:11.469 --> 02:23:11.479 align:start position:0%
sure it extends Beyond ma vaccines as
 
02:23:14.389 --> 02:23:14.399 align:start position:0%
well uh it it would be my interpretation
 
02:23:16.349 --> 02:23:16.359 align:start position:0%
that because the charge of this
 
02:23:18.309 --> 02:23:18.319 align:start position:0%
committee is to evaluate the efficacy of
 
02:23:21.349 --> 02:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
the state response and all of these
 
02:23:23.910 --> 02:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
measures including vaccines were part of
 
02:23:26.670 --> 02:23:26.680 align:start position:0%
the state response as they were
 
02:23:29.710 --> 02:23:29.720 align:start position:0%
recommended um by the Department of
 
02:23:32.269 --> 02:23:32.279 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and uh and
 
02:23:32.279 --> 02:23:33.870 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and uh and
other

02:23:33.870 --> 02:23:33.880 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:23:36.910 --> 02:23:36.920 align:start position:0%
authorities uh they certainly would
 
02:23:40.630 --> 02:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
represent um part of the state response
 
02:23:45.870 --> 02:23:45.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:49.230 --> 02:23:49.240 align:start position:0%
review represent Merchant thank you yes
 
02:23:52.309 --> 02:23:52.319 align:start position:0%
and no I would say we're not here
 
02:23:55.030 --> 02:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
to second guess the
 
02:23:57.550 --> 02:23:57.560 align:start position:0%
FDA um I think at that point in time
 
02:23:59.190 --> 02:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
this information was available to the
 
02:24:01.670 --> 02:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
state and the source of that information
 
02:24:04.510 --> 02:24:04.520 align:start position:0%
so again back to the efficacy of the
 
02:24:05.990 --> 02:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
vaccine or the utilization of the
 
02:24:07.389 --> 02:24:07.399 align:start position:0%
vaccine is different than the efficacy
 
02:24:09.429 --> 02:24:09.439 align:start position:0%
of the vaccine I think utilization of
 
02:24:11.469 --> 02:24:11.479 align:start position:0%
the vaccine um your point is trying to
 
02:24:13.910 --> 02:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
make it tied to the efficacy to the
 
02:24:15.590 --> 02:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
utilization which I understand but again
 
02:24:17.110 --> 02:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
I'll go back to the report itself when
 
02:24:18.630 --> 02:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
talking about the response to the
 
02:24:21.469 --> 02:24:21.479 align:start position:0%
vaccine versus looking
 
02:24:24.469 --> 02:24:24.479 align:start position:0%
at the efficacy of the vaccine itself so
 
02:24:26.150 --> 02:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
I just want to be clear that in the
 
02:24:29.030 --> 02:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
report as we write the report two things
 
02:24:31.510 --> 02:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
one is that the report is in fact
 
02:24:34.389 --> 02:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
balanced between the pros and cons and
 
02:24:35.830 --> 02:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
at the same time because if we want to
 
02:24:37.510 --> 02:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
have a report that has any credibility
 
02:24:39.990 --> 02:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
to it and it's all one-sided it's going
 
02:24:41.590 --> 02:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
to lose a lot of credibility so we have
 
02:24:44.790 --> 02:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
to ensure that in the report that we
 
02:24:47.469 --> 02:24:47.479 align:start position:0%
have addressed the pros and cons of the
 
02:24:49.750 --> 02:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
testimony that was given to us if we
 
02:24:51.950 --> 02:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
don't do that my concern is that again
 
02:24:53.990 --> 02:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
The credibility of that report will not
 
02:24:55.830 --> 02:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
have the merits that it needs to be
 
02:24:57.550 --> 02:24:57.560 align:start position:0%
accepted by the public at
 
02:25:00.429 --> 02:25:00.439 align:start position:0%
large I agree with you
 
02:25:03.110 --> 02:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly representative where yeah
 
02:25:04.830 --> 02:25:04.840 align:start position:0%
I I agree with the representative as
 
02:25:07.950 --> 02:25:07.960 align:start position:0%
well I think in in the sense that um you
 
02:25:11.110 --> 02:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
know M the emergency use
 
02:25:14.950 --> 02:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
authorization has no efficacy data and
 
02:25:17.590 --> 02:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
really has extremely limited safety data
 
02:25:22.670 --> 02:25:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:26.469 --> 02:25:26.479 align:start position:0%
um so you we we certainly cannot comment
 
02:25:30.750 --> 02:25:30.760 align:start position:0%
directly on that I think we can um
 
02:25:30.760 --> 02:25:32.269 align:start position:0%
directly on that I think we can um
evaluate

02:25:32.269 --> 02:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
evaluate
 
02:25:36.670 --> 02:25:36.680 align:start position:0%
how New Hampshire Incorporated emergency
 
02:25:40.469 --> 02:25:40.479 align:start position:0%
use authorization vaccines in the
 
02:25:43.230 --> 02:25:43.240 align:start position:0%
context of having limited efficacy
 
02:25:46.710 --> 02:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
having no efficacy data associated with
 
02:25:49.429 --> 02:25:49.439 align:start position:0%
the vaccines and having extremely
 
02:25:51.950 --> 02:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
limited safety data so I think I think
 
02:25:55.030 --> 02:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
the representative is correct and I
 
02:25:58.750 --> 02:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
think we have to really
 
02:26:05.309 --> 02:26:05.319 align:start position:0%
um be very uh precise and accurate in in
 
02:26:09.269 --> 02:26:09.279 align:start position:0%
our evaluation of that and and the use
 
02:26:10.370 --> 02:26:10.380 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:26:10.380 --> 02:26:12.429 align:start position:0%
of the
[Music]

02:26:12.429 --> 02:26:12.439 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:26:12.439 --> 02:26:14.309 align:start position:0%
[Music]
ea

02:26:14.309 --> 02:26:14.319 align:start position:0%
ea
 
02:26:20.070 --> 02:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
eua uh sorry um eua um vaccine so I
 
02:26:20.080 --> 02:26:20.750 align:start position:0%
eua uh sorry um eua um vaccine so I
think

02:26:20.750 --> 02:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:26:22.790 --> 02:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
I think the there's still an opportunity
 
02:26:25.110 --> 02:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
in the report to do
 
02:26:29.710 --> 02:26:29.720 align:start position:0%
that um but I but I agree and I I I I
 
02:26:32.750 --> 02:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
recommend that we actually point that
 
02:26:36.030 --> 02:26:36.040 align:start position:0%
out that the emergency use authorization
 
02:26:38.429 --> 02:26:38.439 align:start position:0%
has no efficacy data associated with it
 
02:26:41.830 --> 02:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
and extremely limited safety data and
 
02:26:44.349 --> 02:26:44.359 align:start position:0%
that it is really simply a federal
 
02:26:48.630 --> 02:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
response to a problem for which uh all
 
02:26:53.510 --> 02:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
the factors are yet um unknown so thank
 
02:26:56.670 --> 02:26:56.680 align:start position:0%
you represent Merchant also I'd like to
 
02:26:58.630 --> 02:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
be sure that the report includes
 
02:27:01.150 --> 02:27:01.160 align:start position:0%
something I sent to yourself and
 
02:27:04.950 --> 02:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
to um representative eel and one of the
 
02:27:07.910 --> 02:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
things that I've come to realize when
 
02:27:10.150 --> 02:27:10.160 align:start position:0%
you get into a
 
02:27:13.110 --> 02:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
pandemic many times logic goes out the
 
02:27:16.630 --> 02:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
window when you are fearful when you're
 
02:27:19.150 --> 02:27:19.160 align:start position:0%
stressful it's nice to have mondy
 
02:27:21.030 --> 02:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
morning Monday morning quarterback and
 
02:27:23.550 --> 02:27:23.560 align:start position:0%
look at things after the fact when
 
02:27:25.070 --> 02:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
things are settled down you can think
 
02:27:27.150 --> 02:27:27.160 align:start position:0%
about things rationally versus
 
02:27:29.230 --> 02:27:29.240 align:start position:0%
irrationally so I want to be clear
 
02:27:31.389 --> 02:27:31.399 align:start position:0%
somehow in this report that we need to
 
02:27:34.030 --> 02:27:34.040 align:start position:0%
identify that part of this issue was the
 
02:27:37.190 --> 02:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
public itself is the public didn't know
 
02:27:39.469 --> 02:27:39.479 align:start position:0%
what was up or down the public itself
 
02:27:42.190 --> 02:27:42.200 align:start position:0%
was scared was they're fearful and when
 
02:27:43.590 --> 02:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
you get to the point of being very
 
02:27:46.429 --> 02:27:46.439 align:start position:0%
fearful and scared and so forth it's
 
02:27:48.710 --> 02:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
very difficult to understand and
 
02:27:50.750 --> 02:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
ascertain what to believe what not to
 
02:27:52.710 --> 02:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
believe and so forth that played a lot
 
02:27:54.910 --> 02:27:54.920 align:start position:0%
into what happened I think in our state
 
02:27:56.550 --> 02:27:56.560 align:start position:0%
as well as federally and throughout the
 
02:27:58.950 --> 02:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
world because the whole pandemic was
 
02:28:01.750 --> 02:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
just exactly that
 
02:28:05.190 --> 02:28:05.200 align:start position:0%
paranoia um representative wary yes just
 
02:28:08.190 --> 02:28:08.200 align:start position:0%
to echo on to what uh representative M
 
02:28:12.630 --> 02:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
said is that the um and I actually had
 
02:28:16.070 --> 02:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
testified on uh for another bill on the
 
02:28:19.110 --> 02:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
CDC um and some of the problems that
 
02:28:23.389 --> 02:28:23.399 align:start position:0%
occurred with the c CDC and by their own
 
02:28:27.710 --> 02:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
admission they uh gave conflicting and
 
02:28:31.389 --> 02:28:31.399 align:start position:0%
vacillating testimony on what to do and
 
02:28:33.990 --> 02:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
I think that very much added to the
 
02:28:36.830 --> 02:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
public paranoia and the
 
02:28:40.309 --> 02:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
fear um in this pandemic and I think
 
02:28:42.030 --> 02:28:42.040 align:start position:0%
that's a really
 
02:28:45.110 --> 02:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
insightful uh comment there because I
 
02:28:49.230 --> 02:28:49.240 align:start position:0%
think part again part of the response is
 
02:28:49.240 --> 02:28:51.429 align:start position:0%
think part again part of the response is
to

02:28:51.429 --> 02:28:51.439 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:28:55.710 --> 02:28:55.720 align:start position:0%
you you you know if you want if you want
 
02:28:57.750 --> 02:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
people to act logically you almost have
 
02:29:01.269 --> 02:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
to give them a decision tree and part of
 
02:29:03.349 --> 02:29:03.359 align:start position:0%
what and we were discussing some
 
02:29:05.110 --> 02:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
elements of this earlier we did you know
 
02:29:06.750 --> 02:29:06.760 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with an
 
02:29:11.870 --> 02:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
unknown uh you know uh virus uh uh and
 
02:29:14.670 --> 02:29:14.680 align:start position:0%
we're not certain yet which or at least
 
02:29:16.830 --> 02:29:16.840 align:start position:0%
initially we were not certain which
 
02:29:20.750 --> 02:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
demographics were really uh
 
02:29:25.389 --> 02:29:25.399 align:start position:0%
most harmed by the virus and then um so
 
02:29:27.550 --> 02:29:27.560 align:start position:0%
there was again that initial reaction
 
02:29:30.510 --> 02:29:30.520 align:start position:0%
but but shortly after that if in the
 
02:29:32.269 --> 02:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
best of all possible worlds to use a
 
02:29:37.790 --> 02:29:37.800 align:start position:0%
phrase from Vol is we we would have
 
02:29:41.710 --> 02:29:41.720 align:start position:0%
um we would have decided very quickly
 
02:29:44.070 --> 02:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
what demographic was most affected most
 
02:29:47.590 --> 02:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
likely to suffer morbidity from that and
 
02:29:50.030 --> 02:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
then found a way to effectively quar
 
02:29:52.750 --> 02:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
quarantine them and protect them that
 
02:29:55.030 --> 02:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
that should have been our mission as New
 
02:29:58.790 --> 02:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and so I think um you know
 
02:30:03.830 --> 02:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
something along those lines uh how how
 
02:30:07.790 --> 02:30:07.800 align:start position:0%
we uh how we think through our response
 
02:30:10.349 --> 02:30:10.359 align:start position:0%
is going to be very important and the
 
02:30:13.630 --> 02:30:13.640 align:start position:0%
decisionmaking process I um representa
 
02:30:16.070 --> 02:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
belker mentioned earlier on the uh kind
 
02:30:17.790 --> 02:30:17.800 align:start position:0%
of engineering approach being a chemical
 
02:30:20.469 --> 02:30:20.479 align:start position:0%
engineer I'll be mild plug for
 
02:30:23.429 --> 02:30:23.439 align:start position:0%
Engineers um is that if we have that
 
02:30:25.830 --> 02:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
sort of decision-making process and know
 
02:30:29.429 --> 02:30:29.439 align:start position:0%
okay here's how we need to respond um or
 
02:30:31.950 --> 02:30:31.960 align:start position:0%
at least you know here's a response that
 
02:30:33.630 --> 02:30:33.640 align:start position:0%
would have worked better during the last
 
02:30:36.110 --> 02:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
pandemic that certainly puts us in a
 
02:30:40.830 --> 02:30:40.840 align:start position:0%
better frame of reference than um we
 
02:30:46.190 --> 02:30:46.200 align:start position:0%
faced a few years back so I think um I I
 
02:30:49.670 --> 02:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
think it's it's important to do to take
 
02:30:51.389 --> 02:30:51.399 align:start position:0%
some steps to
 
02:30:54.950 --> 02:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
counteract that paranoia and that fear
 
02:30:58.670 --> 02:30:58.680 align:start position:0%
in and we have to do it from you know
 
02:31:01.590 --> 02:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
both an executive and legislative uh
 
02:31:03.710 --> 02:31:03.720 align:start position:0%
perspective as well I think uh that
 
02:31:07.230 --> 02:31:07.240 align:start position:0%
that's imperative as well so thank
 
02:31:11.309 --> 02:31:11.319 align:start position:0%
you so we know that New Hampshire you
 
02:31:14.510 --> 02:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
know we're not perfect but we didn't do
 
02:31:16.309 --> 02:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
everything wrong and we did some good
 
02:31:17.469 --> 02:31:17.479 align:start position:0%
some things
 
02:31:20.269 --> 02:31:20.279 align:start position:0%
right and we heard from the commissioner
 
02:31:22.309 --> 02:31:22.319 align:start position:0%
edelblut that he tried to issue a
 
02:31:24.830 --> 02:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
positive message to overcome the
 
02:31:27.870 --> 02:31:27.880 align:start position:0%
negative fear messages coming from the
 
02:31:30.070 --> 02:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
federal government so we had two
 
02:31:33.469 --> 02:31:33.479 align:start position:0%
competing arguments here in the state
 
02:31:36.230 --> 02:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
but knowing that we had people in the
 
02:31:39.269 --> 02:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
State trying to promote it you know be
 
02:31:41.670 --> 02:31:41.680 align:start position:0%
positive about it instead of just all
 
02:31:41.680 --> 02:31:43.469 align:start position:0%
positive about it instead of just all
negative

02:31:43.469 --> 02:31:43.479 align:start position:0%
negative
 
02:31:49.030 --> 02:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
um is a big win for us and the state um
 
02:31:50.710 --> 02:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
and you
 
02:31:53.469 --> 02:31:53.479 align:start position:0%
know to our credit we had to overcome
 
02:31:53.479 --> 02:31:54.150 align:start position:0%
know to our credit we had to overcome
the

02:31:54.150 --> 02:31:54.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:31:59.469 --> 02:31:59.479 align:start position:0%
federal uh stuff so we need to make sure
 
02:32:02.309 --> 02:32:02.319 align:start position:0%
that we understand the positives that we
 
02:32:04.670 --> 02:32:04.680 align:start position:0%
did and you know getting out a positive
 
02:32:05.830 --> 02:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
message and not
 
02:32:08.830 --> 02:32:08.840 align:start position:0%
fear-mongering um at the state level but
 
02:32:11.309 --> 02:32:11.319 align:start position:0%
it's really hard to
 
02:32:13.870 --> 02:32:13.880 align:start position:0%
overcome that as a state when that
 
02:32:15.469 --> 02:32:15.479 align:start position:0%
everyone else around you is hearing
 
02:32:18.469 --> 02:32:18.479 align:start position:0%
something different represent a merchant
 
02:32:20.670 --> 02:32:20.680 align:start position:0%
I concur with the chair
 
02:32:25.150 --> 02:32:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:28.510 --> 02:32:28.520 align:start position:0%
happened was it
 
02:32:30.790 --> 02:32:30.800 align:start position:0%
was in my
 
02:32:34.110 --> 02:32:34.120 align:start position:0%
opinion it fell into the political Arena
 
02:32:36.790 --> 02:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
and the political Arena decided to use
 
02:32:40.790 --> 02:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
this to become divisive and it played on
 
02:32:42.870 --> 02:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
the paranoia because we had mixed
 
02:32:45.910 --> 02:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
messages we had mixed stories if you
 
02:32:47.870 --> 02:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
will out there and so forth we were not
 
02:32:50.110 --> 02:32:50.120 align:start position:0%
consistent either at the federal level
 
02:32:51.429 --> 02:32:51.439 align:start position:0%
and sometimes with even with their own
 
02:32:55.550 --> 02:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
state so when you have a society that
 
02:32:57.469 --> 02:32:57.479 align:start position:0%
really doesn't understand what's going
 
02:32:59.590 --> 02:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
on that is
 
02:32:59.600 --> 02:33:01.230 align:start position:0%
on that is
fearful

02:33:01.230 --> 02:33:01.240 align:start position:0%
fearful
 
02:33:04.230 --> 02:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
irrational filled with paranoia and you
 
02:33:06.950 --> 02:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
have two competing narratives it's very
 
02:33:09.870 --> 02:33:09.880 align:start position:0%
difficult to get the society to
 
02:33:12.269 --> 02:33:12.279 align:start position:0%
understand which way to go and I think
 
02:33:14.830 --> 02:33:14.840 align:start position:0%
as politicians shame on us because we
 
02:33:16.790 --> 02:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
played into that narrative and we took
 
02:33:19.190 --> 02:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
it unfortunately as an opportunity to
 
02:33:20.389 --> 02:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
politicize it
 
02:33:22.750 --> 02:33:22.760 align:start position:0%
and I think that something also in the
 
02:33:24.710 --> 02:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
report is our response was not just our
 
02:33:27.830 --> 02:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
response but we had two responses if you
 
02:33:30.190 --> 02:33:30.200 align:start position:0%
will we had one on one side one on the
 
02:33:32.389 --> 02:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
other side and and unfortunately the
 
02:33:34.710 --> 02:33:34.720 align:start position:0%
society and the public was confused
 
02:33:37.230 --> 02:33:37.240 align:start position:0%
because we ourselves were not
 
02:33:39.870 --> 02:33:39.880 align:start position:0%
United right and I think we had some
 
02:33:41.510 --> 02:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
really good discussions when uh the
 
02:33:44.030 --> 02:33:44.040 align:start position:0%
honorable Betty gay was here uh talking
 
02:33:46.230 --> 02:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
about bringing in uh people with
 
02:33:50.150 --> 02:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
opposing views um in the future uh would
 
02:33:53.469 --> 02:33:53.479 align:start position:0%
be um be very helpful because then we
 
02:33:55.269 --> 02:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
could probably get to a real
 
02:33:57.510 --> 02:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
solution and we need to gain back the
 
02:33:58.830 --> 02:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
trust of the
 
02:34:01.630 --> 02:34:01.640 align:start position:0%
public um and I think that needs to be
 
02:34:03.790 --> 02:34:03.800 align:start position:0%
one of the things that's really outlined
 
02:34:06.469 --> 02:34:06.479 align:start position:0%
in the report is that we really lost the
 
02:34:09.230 --> 02:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
trust of the public not maybe not at
 
02:34:11.550 --> 02:34:11.560 align:start position:0%
just at this you know maybe the state
 
02:34:13.230 --> 02:34:13.240 align:start position:0%
wasn't responsible but I think surely at
 
02:34:15.469 --> 02:34:15.479 align:start position:0%
the federal level which which trickle
 
02:34:18.630 --> 02:34:18.640 align:start position:0%
down to the States so and I think that's
 
02:34:20.469 --> 02:34:20.479 align:start position:0%
an extremely important message that we
 
02:34:24.830 --> 02:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:26.990 --> 02:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
there does anyone else have anything
 
02:34:30.510 --> 02:34:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:34.750 --> 02:34:34.760 align:start position:0%
afternoon okay well I will say that we
 
02:34:37.150 --> 02:34:37.160 align:start position:0%
are adjourned it is 12:33 and we will
 
02:34:39.230 --> 02:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
adjourn and anyone who can be here will
 
02:34:42.790 --> 02:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
be here October 4th at 10:00 a.m. thank
 
02:34:48.630 --> 02:34:48.640 align:start position:0%
