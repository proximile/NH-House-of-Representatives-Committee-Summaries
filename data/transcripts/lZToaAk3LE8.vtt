design work mostly in the thermal realm
 
00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
I then went back and got an MBA

eventually went to Norway Oslo Norway
 
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
for three years where it's not as cold
 
00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 align:start position:0%

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:06.060 align:start position:0%
looking forward to speaking with you all
 
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:07.980 align:start position:0%
today and going through the presentation
 
00:09:09.949 --> 00:09:09.959 align:start position:0%
with respect to the commission and
 
00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
answering any questions that you all
 
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:17.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:28.260 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:31.380 align:start position:0%
um thank you and good morning again the
 
00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
first thing I'd like to go through with
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
for the hard copies this is Page Three
 
00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:37.860 align:start position:0%
is is the public utilities commissioned
 
00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:40.140 align:start position:0%
as it's currently constituted
 
00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:42.300 align:start position:0%
and this is every single person in the
 
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
organization so we're very small and and
 
00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
tight organization there's the three
 
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
Commissioners that you see before you we
 
00:09:50.509 --> 00:09:50.519 align:start position:0%
have an administrative assistant we have
 
00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:52.860 align:start position:0%
two attorneys two clerks a management
 
00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:54.959 align:start position:0%
analyst the reception is for the
 
00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:57.720 align:start position:0%
building reports into the PC a couple of
 
00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:00.060 align:start position:0%
part-time analysts and then five senior
 
00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:01.860 align:start position:0%
advisors who have a mixed skill set
 
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
between a legal skill set and Technical
 
00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:07.260 align:start position:0%
skill set mostly economics
 
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
so that's that's the PEC in front of you
 
00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:13.380 align:start position:0%
and um when people use the word new puc
 
00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:15.839 align:start position:0%
what they what they mean is that the
 
00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission was split
 
00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:20.360 align:start position:0%
from the Department of energy July 1st
 
00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:24.300 align:start position:0%
2021 by by this legislature
 
00:10:26.449 --> 00:10:26.459 align:start position:0%
um really focusing in the puc in a
 
00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:28.620 align:start position:0%
couple of areas one is conducting
 
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
adjudicative proceedings across
 
00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:33.540 align:start position:0%
different regulatory issues but
 
00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
primarily rate setting financing and
 
00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:39.540 align:start position:0%
asset transfers and mostly electric gas
 
00:10:41.509 --> 00:10:41.519 align:start position:0%
and water utilities though we do have a
 
00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:44.100 align:start position:0%
couple of other areas that we that we
 
00:10:45.949 --> 00:10:45.959 align:start position:0%
adjudicate which I'll go over here
 
00:10:45.959 --> 00:10:47.269 align:start position:0%
adjudicate which I'll go over here
momentarily

00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
momentarily
 
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
and we also have critical
 
00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:50.820 align:start position:0%
non-edjudicative functions such as our
 
00:10:53.329 --> 00:10:53.339 align:start position:0%
investigative Authority rulemaking and
 
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
declaratory rulings an example of the
 
00:10:59.630 --> 00:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
rulemaking would be our 2200 rules which
 
00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:01.740 align:start position:0%
which govern Community aggregation just
 
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
as an example of what those rule makings
 
00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:09.300 align:start position:0%
so turning to uh page five don't forget
 
00:11:11.329 --> 00:11:11.339 align:start position:0%
to advance your slides sorry I didn't
 
00:11:13.069 --> 00:11:13.079 align:start position:0%
Advance the slides there's the slide I
 
00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:15.660 align:start position:0%
was just going over my apologies
 
00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
and uh and this is a slide that talks
 
00:11:20.569 --> 00:11:20.579 align:start position:0%
about what the old PC looks like looked
 
00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
like in the new puc looks like and I
 
00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
think this is hopefully a helpful
 
00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:27.240 align:start position:0%
juxtaposition of the two
 
00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:29.100 align:start position:0%
in the old commission there were nine
 
00:11:30.949 --> 00:11:30.959 align:start position:0%
divisions there were more than 70 people
 
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
there was an executive director there
 
00:11:35.509 --> 00:11:35.519 align:start position:0%
was a general counsel nine division
 
00:11:35.519 --> 00:11:36.889 align:start position:0%
was a general counsel nine division
directors

00:11:36.889 --> 00:11:36.899 align:start position:0%
directors
 
00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:38.700 align:start position:0%
and a staff that reported through the
 
00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:39.889 align:start position:0%
and a staff that reported through the
directors

00:11:39.889 --> 00:11:39.899 align:start position:0%
directors
 
00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:42.500 align:start position:0%
the staff oversaw oversaw policy
 
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
Administration and it also offered
 
00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
positions to the Commissioners in
 
00:11:48.889 --> 00:11:48.899 align:start position:0%
adjudications which was something that
 
00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
the legislature and um and I think
 
00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:53.100 align:start position:0%
perhaps the governor were concerned
 
00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:55.380 align:start position:0%
about and was was one of the reasons for
 
00:11:58.130 --> 00:11:58.140 align:start position:0%
the split and in this new Commission on
 
00:12:00.829 --> 00:12:00.839 align:start position:0%
the right side of the chart here you'll
 
00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:02.700 align:start position:0%
see that three Commissioners the 12
 
00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
full-time people in addition there were
 
00:12:07.069 --> 00:12:07.079 align:start position:0%
there were the two part-time folks that
 
00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
you saw on the chart
 
00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:11.220 align:start position:0%
um everyone now reports directly to the
 
00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:13.500 align:start position:0%
chairman and so that's uh that's for you
 
00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:14.820 align:start position:0%
know I think communication is
 
00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:16.860 align:start position:0%
streamlined um everyone can easily
 
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
communicate with each other there's not
 
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
a layer of management uh in between uh
 
00:12:24.949 --> 00:12:24.959 align:start position:0%
all the folks working at the commission
 
00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:27.180 align:start position:0%
in the doe who I know you heard from a
 
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
couple of weeks ago is known independent
 
00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:30.660 align:start position:0%
and statutory party to all the
 
00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
proceedings they provide the commission
 
00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:34.740 align:start position:0%
with independent information on the
 
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
record that helps us render uh reason to
 
00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:40.980 align:start position:0%
sound in in Fair decisions
 
00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:42.410 align:start position:0%
sound in in Fair decisions
foreign

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:42.420 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:46.740 align:start position:0%
so the next slide page six is an
 
00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
illustration hard to see on the screen
 
00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
probably but perhaps easier with the
 
00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
hard copies that just shows
 
00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:55.129 align:start position:0%
hard copies that just shows
um

00:12:55.129 --> 00:12:55.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:58.250 --> 00:12:58.260 align:start position:0%
the utilities that we regulate so on the
 
00:13:00.889 --> 00:13:00.899 align:start position:0%
colorful chart on the upper left those
 
00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
are the electric utilities dark blue is
 
00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:07.980 align:start position:0%
eversource light blue is Unitil yellow
 
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
is Liberty
 
00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:12.060 align:start position:0%
and on the bottom you can see how those
 
00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:14.940 align:start position:0%
split in terms of customers so most of
 
00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:16.860 align:start position:0%
our electric customers in the state are
 
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
eversource customers there's over half a
 
00:13:20.449 --> 00:13:20.459 align:start position:0%
million ever Source customers in the
 
00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:23.700 align:start position:0%
state and they're over 80 percent of the
 
00:13:26.509 --> 00:13:26.519 align:start position:0%
state's electric customers
 
00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
um underneath that you have a Unitil and
 
00:13:29.279 --> 00:13:30.590 align:start position:0%
um underneath that you have a Unitil and
Liberty

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
Liberty
 
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
that have 13 and seven percent of the
 
00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
state's customers respectively
 
00:13:38.569 --> 00:13:38.579 align:start position:0%
on the color chart uh next to the
 
00:13:40.009 --> 00:13:40.019 align:start position:0%
electric chart so immediately to the
 
00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:41.940 align:start position:0%
right you can see on that chart the
 
00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:44.220 align:start position:0%
yellow which is liberty and the dark
 
00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
blue which is Unitil
 
00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
Liberty has about a hundred thousand
 
00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
customers in the state and Unitil has
 
00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
about 35 000 customers so that's like a
 
00:13:58.190 --> 00:13:58.200 align:start position:0%
three-quarter one quarter split yes sir
 
00:13:59.870 --> 00:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
we have a question from representative
 
00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
Thomas well thank you Mr chairman thank
 
00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I'm just
 
00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:05.100 align:start position:0%
curious uh
 
00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
does the puc have any
 
00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:11.820 align:start position:0%
um Authority in how these areas were a
 
00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
lot allotted to the very utilities and
 
00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
if so uh very briefly can you explain
 
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
why they're so fragmented
 
00:14:23.569 --> 00:14:23.579 align:start position:0%
commissioner Simpson would you like to
 
00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:25.980 align:start position:0%
take that one
 
00:14:29.889 --> 00:14:29.899 align:start position:0%
so the puc has has franchise Authority
 
00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:34.620 align:start position:0%
and utility franchises are authorized by
 
00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:37.009 align:start position:0%
and utility franchises are authorized by
municipality

00:14:37.009 --> 00:14:37.019 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
00:14:40.129 --> 00:14:40.139 align:start position:0%
um historically if we go back to the
 
00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:44.220 align:start position:0%
turn of the century 20th century
 
00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
the original utilities were primarily
 
00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:49.860 align:start position:0%
Gas Utilities in the country and they
 
00:14:51.889 --> 00:14:51.899 align:start position:0%
manufactured natural gas for lighting
 
00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:54.779 align:start position:0%
and then those street lights were built
 
00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:57.240 align:start position:0%
out through municipalities and then
 
00:14:59.210 --> 00:14:59.220 align:start position:0%
similar with electric power as electric
 
00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
power generation became more widely
 
00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:04.760 align:start position:0%
available there were small scale
 
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
generators that then built Distribution
 
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
Systems off of those power generators to
 
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
serve local areas so there was this
 
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
fragmentation of of companies and it was
 
00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:19.380 align:start position:0%
really at a more local level like for
 
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
instance one of our utilities in the
 
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:22.980 align:start position:0%
state is Unitil and one of the
 
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
predecessor companies was Concord
 
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
Electric company so there was a utility
 
00:15:28.509 --> 00:15:28.519 align:start position:0%
for Concord
 
00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
similarly in Hampton and Exeter Exeter
 
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
and Hampton electric company there was a
 
00:15:35.689 --> 00:15:35.699 align:start position:0%
generation facility that built out built
 
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
a distribution Network and served the
 
00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:41.100 align:start position:0%
local area and the puc is the entity
 
00:15:44.689 --> 00:15:44.699 align:start position:0%
that authorizes utilities to
 
00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:48.060 align:start position:0%
operate within municipalities today all
 
00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:49.980 align:start position:0%
municipalities are franchised for
 
00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
electric service but on water natural
 
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
gas side sewer there are opportunities
 
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
for new utilities to come about I think
 
00:16:02.329 --> 00:16:02.339 align:start position:0%
another piece that's important to
 
00:16:04.189 --> 00:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
recognize is a lot of consolidation
 
00:16:06.769 --> 00:16:06.779 align:start position:0%
that's happened over the years the
 
00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
fragmentation is the merger of multiple
 
00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
companies over the years so Unitil is
 
00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
what was Concord Electric and extra in
 
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
Hampton they have two discrete systems
 
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
across the state but it's one utility
 
00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:22.620 align:start position:0%
today that serves both of those areas
 
00:16:25.129 --> 00:16:25.139 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question yes thank
 
00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:31.980 align:start position:0%
before you continue representative
 
00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:34.380 align:start position:0%
Bernardi has a question
 
00:16:36.769 --> 00:16:36.779 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so I noticed a few
 
00:16:38.569 --> 00:16:38.579 align:start position:0%
areas up in the northern part of the
 
00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:41.100 align:start position:0%
state in white they have no electric
 
00:16:44.569 --> 00:16:44.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:47.449 --> 00:16:47.459 align:start position:0%
those are municipally served so there
 
00:16:48.889 --> 00:16:48.899 align:start position:0%
are individuals
 
00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
um some Municipal Utilities that serve
 
00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:53.100 align:start position:0%
those areas and they're not regulated by
 
00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:01.629 --> 00:17:01.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:04.980 align:start position:0%
the um utility company that our chairman
 
00:17:07.309 --> 00:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
has is not on here because they're
 
00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:10.799 align:start position:0%
independent is that correct is that
 
00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:12.780 align:start position:0%
the co-op so the New Hampshire Electric
 
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
Co-op is not on the table in terms of
 
00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
customers the commission has uh
 
00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
significantly more limited regulatory
 
00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:21.839 align:start position:0%
authority over the New Hampshire
 
00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
Electric Cooperative we do not rate
 
00:17:27.289 --> 00:17:27.299 align:start position:0%
regulate The Cooperative
 
00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
um there are programs and areas with
 
00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:32.100 align:start position:0%
which we have regulatory Authority but
 
00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
our core Focus as the commission of as
 
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
an economic rate regulator we do not
 
00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:40.380 align:start position:0%
approve and regulate the rates that the
 
00:17:42.049 --> 00:17:42.059 align:start position:0%
Cooperative charges to their customers
 
00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:44.100 align:start position:0%
and that's why they're not reflected on
 
00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:46.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question
 
00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:50.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
taking my question I notice uh that
 
00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
several towns are served by multiple
 
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.090 align:start position:0%
several towns are served by multiple
providers

00:17:59.090 --> 00:17:59.100 align:start position:0%
providers
 
00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:00.900 align:start position:0%
um you know I I'm looking at Hanover and
 
00:18:03.169 --> 00:18:03.179 align:start position:0%
I see that it's got Liberty and New
 
00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:05.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Electric Co-op for example and
 
00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
but many towns like that so if the
 
00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:09.900 align:start position:0%
franchises are done municipally how does
 
00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
that happen so I think that's a a again
 
00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:15.780 align:start position:0%
a legacy of the way that the systems
 
00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
were built out that the systems built
 
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
out organically over time to serve
 
00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:23.820 align:start position:0%
customers and within municipalities you
 
00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:25.860 align:start position:0%
may see that there are multiple
 
00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:27.780 align:start position:0%
utilities and that's because multiple
 
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
utilities built out over time and as new
 
00:18:33.169 --> 00:18:33.179 align:start position:0%
homes and properties are developed it
 
00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:35.460 align:start position:0%
may be more economic for
 
00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:37.980 align:start position:0%
a utility that perhaps doesn't serve
 
00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:41.039 align:start position:0%
that Community but is closer to that
 
00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:43.500 align:start position:0%
property than the incumbent within the
 
00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:46.260 align:start position:0%
municipality and there are agreements
 
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
that sometimes come before us to enable
 
00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
a utility to serve a customer that's
 
00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
outside of their franchise but would be
 
00:19:06.169 --> 00:19:06.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question
 
00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:11.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you thank
 
00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
you for coming in
 
00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.090 align:start position:0%
you for coming in
um

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:14.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:17.039 align:start position:0%
your your staff has decreased quite a
 
00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:20.100 align:start position:0%
bit and and I realized that it that is
 
00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
probably in lot well it's large part due
 
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
to the restructuring of the relationship
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
between the puc and the DOE but can you
 
00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
comment on on whether 12 people plus the
 
00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:34.620 align:start position:0%
three of you is enough to fulfill you
 
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
know what's still a pretty significantly
 
00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:39.660 align:start position:0%
large portfolio of responsibilities
 
00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for asking I think we're
 
00:19:45.409 --> 00:19:45.419 align:start position:0%
very cognizant of the fact that we're
 
00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:47.160 align:start position:0%
we're spending rate payer money we're
 
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
spending you know eventually taxpayer
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
money and so we want to be you know
 
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
right size so that we're uh we're we're
 
00:19:55.909 --> 00:19:55.919 align:start position:0%
doing the job with uh with the minimum
 
00:19:58.250 --> 00:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
amount of resources and based on what
 
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
we're doing today we believe we are
 
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
um we do have sufficient resources to
 
00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:05.580 align:start position:0%
cover everything today I could go over
 
00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:07.380 align:start position:0%
some statistics if it wouldn't be too
 
00:20:09.409 --> 00:20:09.419 align:start position:0%
boring in terms of the output of the
 
00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:11.100 align:start position:0%
commission and what we've been able to
 
00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:12.660 align:start position:0%
do with the current level of resources
 
00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:16.640 align:start position:0%
we do have an open uh um an open
 
00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:19.940 align:start position:0%
requisition for an additional
 
00:20:22.549 --> 00:20:22.559 align:start position:0%
additional senior advisor so there is
 
00:20:24.409 --> 00:20:24.419 align:start position:0%
one open position
 
00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:26.580 align:start position:0%
uh but but the short answer to your
 
00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
question hopefully is that we believe
 
00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
we're right-sized for today's scope now
 
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
if the legislature were to add
 
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to the puc then then
 
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
that would be something that we would
 
00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:38.580 align:start position:0%
need to look at depending on the scope
 
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
of those activities a follow-up yes
 
00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:42.660 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:43.310 align:start position:0%
follow up
um

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
one of the responsibilities that you s
 
00:20:49.789 --> 00:20:49.799 align:start position:0%
that you um say that you you have is you
 
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
know that you have investigative
 
00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:53.220 align:start position:0%
Authority who who does the
 
00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:55.130 align:start position:0%
Authority who who does the
investigations

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:55.140 align:start position:0%
investigations
 
00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:56.820 align:start position:0%
um from the 12 people that you have on
 
00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:57.650 align:start position:0%
um from the 12 people that you have on
staff

00:20:57.650 --> 00:20:57.660 align:start position:0%
staff
 
00:20:59.750 --> 00:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
so that's uh that's a commission
 
00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
activity so it's not uh it's not a
 
00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:03.780 align:start position:0%
single person or persons that's the
 
00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
Commissioners that's the staff uh
 
00:21:07.909 --> 00:21:07.919 align:start position:0%
whoever is assigned to that particular
 
00:21:07.919 --> 00:21:10.190 align:start position:0%
whoever is assigned to that particular
investigation

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
and uh just as a follow-up to his
 
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
question if you became the site
 
00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:19.860 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee would you have
 
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
sufficient staff provided there was
 
00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
maybe some additional Staffing in the
 
00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
legislation to do that take on that
 
00:21:30.409 --> 00:21:30.419 align:start position:0%
responsibility we would need additional
 
00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:34.559 align:start position:0%
resources to handle the SEC activity as
 
00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:36.780 align:start position:0%
currently constituted in the legislation
 
00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:38.340 align:start position:0%
that I've seen
 
00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:45.260 align:start position:0%
representative partial has a question
 
00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
would like to thus get clarity on this
 
00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:49.380 align:start position:0%
one thing that you said
 
00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:50.700 align:start position:0%
um thank you for coming today by the way
 
00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:52.980 align:start position:0%
of course utility franchises crossover
 
00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:54.900 align:start position:0%
medicinal borders at times for the sake
 
00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
of so one municipality may be served by
 
00:22:03.289 --> 00:22:03.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative Noel has a question
 
00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
my background was in the railroads and I
 
00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:12.900 align:start position:0%
noticed you don't have any reference to
 
00:22:15.289 --> 00:22:15.299 align:start position:0%
the railroads anymore it has has your
 
00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
regulatory Authority uh lapsed in
 
00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:20.220 align:start position:0%
regards to the railroads
 
00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:22.020 align:start position:0%
I think the answer to that is yes in
 
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
fact there's legislation proposed by
 
00:22:27.409 --> 00:22:27.419 align:start position:0%
representative Vose that cleans up some
 
00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
of the statutes and um and particularly
 
00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:32.340 align:start position:0%
with respect to the railroads it moves
 
00:22:33.649 --> 00:22:33.659 align:start position:0%
it moves it to the appropriate Place
 
00:22:35.149 --> 00:22:35.159 align:start position:0%
mostly the Department of Transportation
 
00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
okay now I guess we can move on
 
00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:43.860 align:start position:0%
I haven't even finished the slide yet so
 
00:22:45.409 --> 00:22:45.419 align:start position:0%
that's that's exciting it must have been
 
00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
a good slide I appreciate the questions
 
00:22:50.149 --> 00:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
um just to continue after the to the
 
00:22:53.029 --> 00:22:53.039 align:start position:0%
right of the plus sign on the um
 
00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:55.980 align:start position:0%
on the on the table is there are the
 
00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
water utilities in the upper right
 
00:22:59.270 --> 00:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
there's about a dozen water utilities
 
00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:02.100 align:start position:0%
that we regulate primarily pennichuck
 
00:23:05.289 --> 00:23:05.299 align:start position:0%
which is based out of Nashua and uh
 
00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:07.740 align:start position:0%
Aquarian is the second biggest so I
 
00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
think um panacek has about 35 000
 
00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:12.780 align:start position:0%
customers uh Aquarian has about ten
 
00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:14.270 align:start position:0%
customers uh Aquarian has about ten
thousand

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
00:23:15.649 --> 00:23:15.659 align:start position:0%
so that's the scope of the water
 
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
utilities the sewer utilities are very
 
00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:19.260 align:start position:0%
small and there's only about a half
 
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
dozen of them all of all of which are
 
00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:23.580 align:start position:0%
less than a thousand customers and then
 
00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:26.340 align:start position:0%
finally we have some Authority
 
00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
regulatory Authority in the Telecom
 
00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:31.020 align:start position:0%
space for us it mostly takes the form of
 
00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
poll transfers at this at this point in
 
00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:34.909 align:start position:0%
poll transfers at this at this point in
time

00:23:34.909 --> 00:23:34.919 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
so before I move on to the next slide
 
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
I'll just just pause a minute to see if
 
00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:43.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:45.529 --> 00:23:45.539 align:start position:0%
don't say any move along all right thank
 
00:23:48.049 --> 00:23:48.059 align:start position:0%
you thank you so just uh moving back up
 
00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:49.620 align:start position:0%
to 10 000 feet
 
00:23:52.669 --> 00:23:52.679 align:start position:0%
I'll highlight our mission statement and
 
00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:55.380 align:start position:0%
it's to ensure that customers of the
 
00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
utilities that we regulate receive safe
 
00:23:59.930 --> 00:23:59.940 align:start position:0%
adequate and reliable service at just in
 
00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:02.460 align:start position:0%
reasonable rates I'll also Point your
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
attention to line four on the mission
 
00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:06.360 align:start position:0%
statement which is
 
00:24:08.029 --> 00:24:08.039 align:start position:0%
to provide a thorough but efficient
 
00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:10.740 align:start position:0%
regulatory process that is fair open and
 
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
Innovative and when I think about this
 
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
line I think about a trip to Frankfurt
 
00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:17.340 align:start position:0%
you know about 10 years ago and the line
 
00:24:18.649 --> 00:24:18.659 align:start position:0%
at the airport in front of the metal
 
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
detectors was about half a mile long
 
00:24:23.029 --> 00:24:23.039 align:start position:0%
literally half a mile long
 
00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
almost everybody missed their flight
 
00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
flights were taking off with 10 or 12
 
00:24:28.549 --> 00:24:28.559 align:start position:0%
people on those flights and when I got
 
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
up to the front of the line we all got
 
00:24:32.049 --> 00:24:32.059 align:start position:0%
up to the front of the line we saw a
 
00:24:35.049 --> 00:24:35.059 align:start position:0%
gentleman going through everyone's bags
 
00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:37.740 align:start position:0%
very very thoroughly he was turning over
 
00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:40.620 align:start position:0%
every shirt every she looking inside
 
00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:43.860 align:start position:0%
every shoe each bag took about five or
 
00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:45.720 align:start position:0%
six minutes for him to go through and
 
00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:47.820 align:start position:0%
everyone was missing their flight so we
 
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
don't want people to miss their flight
 
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
at the puc we want to be thorough but we
 
00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:53.340 align:start position:0%
also want to be efficient so we're
 
00:24:55.909 --> 00:24:55.919 align:start position:0%
processing dockets in an efficient
 
00:24:57.890 --> 00:24:57.900 align:start position:0%
manner so we don't want to be like the
 
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
guy at the Frankfurt Airport
 
00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:01.500 align:start position:0%
um we also
 
00:25:03.049 --> 00:25:03.059 align:start position:0%
um want to Foster competition where
 
00:25:05.149 --> 00:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
appropriate provide necessary uh
 
00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:07.740 align:start position:0%
customer protection and of course
 
00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
perform our responsibilities ethically
 
00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:14.029 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:25:14.029 --> 00:25:14.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:16.549 --> 00:25:16.559 align:start position:0%
um you know the best way of saying that
 
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
I think is to look at RSA 36317a which
 
00:25:24.049 --> 00:25:24.059 align:start position:0%
is the commission as arbiter
 
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
so it's our job to see that the
 
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
commission balances the interests of the
 
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.010 align:start position:0%
commission balances the interests of the
customer

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:31.020 align:start position:0%
customer
 
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
and the interests of the regular
 
00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:35.700 align:start position:0%
regulated utilities and uh we need to
 
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
keep the utilities have to stay in
 
00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:38.340 align:start position:0%
business they have to have shareholders
 
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
they have to be able to afford the
 
00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:41.700 align:start position:0%
investment that's that's critical
 
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:44.340 align:start position:0%
without invested
 
00:25:47.029 --> 00:25:47.039 align:start position:0%
um utilities uh that we would we
 
00:25:48.409 --> 00:25:48.419 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have Services here in New
 
00:25:50.029 --> 00:25:50.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that's and that's critical
 
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
and at the same time we want to make
 
00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:53.700 align:start position:0%
sure that the customer the interest of
 
00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:55.620 align:start position:0%
the customer are being taken care of and
 
00:25:57.409 --> 00:25:57.419 align:start position:0%
mostly that's in the form of cost but
 
00:25:59.810 --> 00:25:59.820 align:start position:0%
there are also different attributes to
 
00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:01.740 align:start position:0%
making sure that the the customer is
 
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
attended to representative oh I'm sorry
 
00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:05.580 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas has a question
 
00:26:07.549 --> 00:26:07.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:26:09.409 --> 00:26:09.419 align:start position:0%
taking my question I have to ask this
 
00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
question only because uh from comments
 
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
I've seen on Facebook uh and I'm sure
 
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
lack of understanding of what the puc
 
00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
can do
 
00:26:21.649 --> 00:26:21.659 align:start position:0%
what would you say to people that are
 
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
saying that with these
 
00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
spiking rate hikes which are devastating
 
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
to most of our constituents
 
00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:34.380 align:start position:0%
why why can't the puc just tell utility
 
00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:37.740 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry that rate is too high for our
 
00:26:40.549 --> 00:26:40.559 align:start position:0%
consumers uh we just can't let you go
 
00:26:42.769 --> 00:26:42.779 align:start position:0%
that high with that rate even though
 
00:26:45.649 --> 00:26:45.659 align:start position:0%
you've provided us with documentation we
 
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
feel it's it's it's going to hurt our
 
00:26:49.789 --> 00:26:49.799 align:start position:0%
customers and our constituents and this
 
00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:52.220 align:start position:0%
we we just can't allow that
 
00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
why can't you do that that is for the
 
00:26:57.169 --> 00:26:57.179 align:start position:0%
benefit of people that say you should
 
00:27:00.169 --> 00:27:00.179 align:start position:0%
have oh no thank you for that question I
 
00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
think that uh first of all we have an
 
00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
investigative docket open right now
 
00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:07.020 align:start position:0%
um to the to the point of Representative
 
00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:10.620 align:start position:0%
Munds that is um that we're looking at
 
00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:12.900 align:start position:0%
how we can do what we call default
 
00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:14.340 align:start position:0%
service which is the rate you're talking
 
00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:16.260 align:start position:0%
about for electricity or cost of gas
 
00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
which is the rate for gas
 
00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:20.700 align:start position:0%
and looking at ways in which we can run
 
00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:22.740 align:start position:0%
that process better we can improve the
 
00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:25.500 align:start position:0%
process to hopefully get lower rates for
 
00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:28.020 align:start position:0%
consumers inside of our current process
 
00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:31.700 align:start position:0%
inside of the current rules and statutes
 
00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:34.500 align:start position:0%
what happens is that the utility comes
 
00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
before us
 
00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:38.820 align:start position:0%
they have a process where they go to the
 
00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:41.940 align:start position:0%
market and they try to secure the best
 
00:27:44.029 --> 00:27:44.039 align:start position:0%
rate that they can inside the the
 
00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
wholesale and Retail markets and um and
 
00:27:49.789 --> 00:27:49.799 align:start position:0%
and get that lowest rate for consumers
 
00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:53.400 align:start position:0%
so there is a process in place today to
 
00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:56.100 align:start position:0%
um to get the lowest possible rate so
 
00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
far as we know but an investigative duck
 
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
it can can explore different options for
 
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
example other states use laddering
 
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
schemes where um basically your dollar
 
00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:08.700 align:start position:0%
cost averaging As you move on the way up
 
00:28:10.549 --> 00:28:10.559 align:start position:0%
and on the way down in terms of utility
 
00:28:13.789 --> 00:28:13.799 align:start position:0%
prices so that Smooths things out some
 
00:28:15.769 --> 00:28:15.779 align:start position:0%
other states are going directly to the
 
00:28:18.169 --> 00:28:18.179 align:start position:0%
day ahead market and so they're they're
 
00:28:21.049 --> 00:28:21.059 align:start position:0%
taking some uh potentially some risk out
 
00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
um out of the equation so the risk
 
00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:25.980 align:start position:0%
premium I should say out of the equation
 
00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
so different options that that we're
 
00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:31.140 align:start position:0%
looking at and evaluating and that that
 
00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
docket is ongoing and we expect to think
 
00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:35.820 align:start position:0%
the next hearing on that is later this
 
00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:38.810 align:start position:0%
the next hearing on that is later this
month

00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:38.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:41.820 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you Mr thank you for the
 
00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:44.820 align:start position:0%
follow-up can you please define ongoing
 
00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:47.580 align:start position:0%
because our people are hurting with your
 
00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:50.100 align:start position:0%
rates and if anything can be done sooner
 
00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:51.900 align:start position:0%
than later
 
00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
yeah I think there's there's two things
 
00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
going on here one is that we have rates
 
00:28:58.970 --> 00:28:58.980 align:start position:0%
that have already been set uh for six
 
00:29:00.409 --> 00:29:00.419 align:start position:0%
month periods because we because
 
00:29:01.909 --> 00:29:01.919 align:start position:0%
consumers and I'm talking about the
 
00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:05.220 align:start position:0%
electric Market consumers also
 
00:29:08.269 --> 00:29:08.279 align:start position:0%
um are very interested in stable pricing
 
00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:10.860 align:start position:0%
so so those prices are set and and
 
00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:14.820 align:start position:0%
stable the process improvements are are
 
00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:17.220 align:start position:0%
longer term though we don't intend on
 
00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:19.380 align:start position:0%
this investigative docket lasting years
 
00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:22.020 align:start position:0%
we intend on it lasting months so we are
 
00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:23.940 align:start position:0%
motivated to resolve it as quickly as
 
00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:28.430 align:start position:0%
motivated to resolve it as quickly as
possible

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:31.380 align:start position:0%
representative closure has a question
 
00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:34.260 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question
 
00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:37.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:29:39.529 --> 00:29:39.539 align:start position:0%
um following up on representative
 
00:29:42.409 --> 00:29:42.419 align:start position:0%
Thomas's question uh I really have two
 
00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
questions one is what incentive do the
 
00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
utilities have to keep the default
 
00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:50.820 align:start position:0%
service cost low and how often is it
 
00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:53.820 align:start position:0%
that the puc does say to a utility no
 
00:29:59.710 --> 00:29:59.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:02.580 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:30:03.889 --> 00:30:03.899 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry can you give me your first
 
00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
question again I lost track your first
 
00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:07.260 align:start position:0%
and your second what's the incentive
 
00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:08.940 align:start position:0%
that the utilities have to keep the
 
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
default service cost low I think they
 
00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:13.140 align:start position:0%
you know they're in the business of
 
00:30:15.049 --> 00:30:15.059 align:start position:0%
servicing customers and that those
 
00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
customers are unhappy with utilities
 
00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:19.740 align:start position:0%
when utility rates go up they they take
 
00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:22.020 align:start position:0%
the heat for that and so I think
 
00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
utilities are generally speaking
 
00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:25.740 align:start position:0%
motivated to get the lowest possible
 
00:30:27.889 --> 00:30:27.899 align:start position:0%
rate it's to keep their phone from
 
00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:29.580 align:start position:0%
ringing and keep their customers from
 
00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:32.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner Simpson would like to add
 
00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:37.620 align:start position:0%
to that I have some slides
 
00:30:40.909 --> 00:30:40.919 align:start position:0%
coming up that discuss the regulatory
 
00:30:42.529 --> 00:30:42.539 align:start position:0%
framework that exists within New
 
00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and there are differences on
 
00:30:47.389 --> 00:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
both electric and the gas side with
 
00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
respect to the supply portion of what
 
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
customers pay for a bill
 
00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:55.620 align:start position:0%
fundamentally on the electric side New
 
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a restructured state
 
00:31:00.169 --> 00:31:00.179 align:start position:0%
meaning that our incumbent regulated
 
00:31:03.289 --> 00:31:03.299 align:start position:0%
utilities do not own and operate power
 
00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:05.220 align:start position:0%
generation resources
 
00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:06.529 align:start position:0%
generation resources
so

00:31:06.529 --> 00:31:06.539 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:10.669 --> 00:31:10.679 align:start position:0%
they purchase energy within the New
 
00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:13.020 align:start position:0%
England Market through the New England
 
00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:14.580 align:start position:0%
power pool and I saw New England
 
00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:17.090 align:start position:0%
power pool and I saw New England
participants

00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:17.100 align:start position:0%
participants
 
00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
um it's I think a similar analogy is
 
00:31:21.889 --> 00:31:21.899 align:start position:0%
that when you go to the gas pump you
 
00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:24.260 align:start position:0%
don't have an opportunity to
 
00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
lower or raise that price it's based on
 
00:31:31.669 --> 00:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
on what the market price is and the
 
00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:34.020 align:start position:0%
utilities are purchasing electricity
 
00:31:37.149 --> 00:31:37.159 align:start position:0%
they're purchasing gas in in the market
 
00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
and they do not Mark those costs up
 
00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:42.740 align:start position:0%
there's no profit that's made there
 
00:31:45.169 --> 00:31:45.179 align:start position:0%
so it's ultimately
 
00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:48.620 align:start position:0%
procured by the utility and then
 
00:31:51.649 --> 00:31:51.659 align:start position:0%
passed through to cust retail customers
 
00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:55.260 align:start position:0%
directly and then with respect to the
 
00:31:57.950 --> 00:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
question on what motivates the utilities
 
00:32:00.529 --> 00:32:00.539 align:start position:0%
why would they be motivated to not
 
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
charge those rates
 
00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:04.740 align:start position:0%
um I would say that utilities are
 
00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:08.100 align:start position:0%
overall price sensitive and they they do
 
00:32:09.649 --> 00:32:09.659 align:start position:0%
not like to see
 
00:32:12.169 --> 00:32:12.179 align:start position:0%
a price shocks and instability in those
 
00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
markets because they recognize that
 
00:32:16.909 --> 00:32:16.919 align:start position:0%
their customers that they serve are
 
00:32:18.889 --> 00:32:18.899 align:start position:0%
going to be negatively impacted by that
 
00:32:21.649 --> 00:32:21.659 align:start position:0%
it's bad business for them it's it's a
 
00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
bad customer relationship that they
 
00:32:26.389 --> 00:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
build with their uh with the customers
 
00:32:28.909 --> 00:32:28.919 align:start position:0%
and with the utility
 
00:32:31.669 --> 00:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
in the second part of my question please
 
00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
about how how often you deny a rate I I
 
00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
personally don't I can't think of any
 
00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
time when a rate has been uh a default
 
00:32:46.909 --> 00:32:46.919 align:start position:0%
service procurement rate has been denied
 
00:32:48.649 --> 00:32:48.659 align:start position:0%
by the commission I've only been on the
 
00:32:50.029 --> 00:32:50.039 align:start position:0%
commission for just over a year so it
 
00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:52.500 align:start position:0%
might have happened in the past but it's
 
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh it's something we could look into if
 
00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:56.039 align:start position:0%
you'd like us to follow up on that
 
00:32:59.029 --> 00:32:59.039 align:start position:0%
question we're happy to do that
 
00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh representative munz has a question
 
00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.090 align:start position:0%
uh representative munz has a question
too

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:02.100 align:start position:0%
too
 
00:33:04.669 --> 00:33:04.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:33:04.679 --> 00:33:06.529 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

00:33:06.529 --> 00:33:06.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:08.940 align:start position:0%
the utilities are also publicly traded
 
00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:10.500 align:start position:0%
companies and they have responsibilities
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
to their shareholders I just want to
 
00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:16.860 align:start position:0%
confirm that there is no profit margin
 
00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:19.620 align:start position:0%
on the default service rate it's just a
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
pure pass-through of what their purchase
 
00:33:24.049 --> 00:33:24.059 align:start position:0%
what they're purchasing in terms of
 
00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:37.860 align:start position:0%
to develop the rfps to solicit that to
 
00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:41.700 align:start position:0%
perform the mechanics of of that that's
 
00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
included in the cost that they can
 
00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:44.630 align:start position:0%
included in the cost that they can
recover

00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
recover
 
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
but there's no incentive there's no uh
 
00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:50.580 align:start position:0%
earnings on top of that for the
 
00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:52.980 align:start position:0%
utilities for default service
 
00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:56.810 align:start position:0%
utilities for default service
follow-up

00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:00.529 --> 00:34:00.539 align:start position:0%
yeah I I I want to add another aspect to
 
00:34:00.539 --> 00:34:01.610 align:start position:0%
yeah I I I want to add another aspect to
this

00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:01.620 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
um the the rates that the utilities ask
 
00:34:07.789 --> 00:34:07.799 align:start position:0%
us to
 
00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:11.820 align:start position:0%
um bless they we do look at whether
 
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
those rates are competitive or not now
 
00:34:17.950 --> 00:34:17.960 align:start position:0%
that itself is not a very easy process
 
00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:20.470 align:start position:0%
that itself is not a very easy process
but

00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:23.700 align:start position:0%
if we if if there is a threshold there
 
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
and we kind of conclude that the rates
 
00:34:28.609 --> 00:34:28.619 align:start position:0%
aren't competitive then we can we can
 
00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:31.740 align:start position:0%
decide that that default rate is not you
 
00:34:33.589 --> 00:34:33.599 align:start position:0%
know acceptable
 
00:34:36.829 --> 00:34:36.839 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a follow-up so
 
00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for clarifying that on the
 
00:34:40.490 --> 00:34:40.500 align:start position:0%
administrative cost so I'm assuming that
 
00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:42.260 align:start position:0%
that's something that you're looking at
 
00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:44.700 align:start position:0%
routinely to make sure that those levels
 
00:34:46.849 --> 00:34:46.859 align:start position:0%
are appropriate
 
00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:49.980 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely and I think to build off
 
00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:52.260 align:start position:0%
of what commissioner goldner had noted
 
00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:53.700 align:start position:0%
with respect to the ongoing
 
00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
investigation what we're trying to do is
 
00:34:58.790 --> 00:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
is evaluate the process that exists
 
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
today that's largely been in place for
 
00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
20 years since restructuring around 2000
 
00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
2001 when the utilities in New Hampshire
 
00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
either owned their own power plants or
 
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
contracted directly for power and
 
00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:16.020 align:start position:0%
long-term contracts now they issue a
 
00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:18.060 align:start position:0%
six-month solicitation
 
00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
to procure the amount of energy that
 
00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:22.140 align:start position:0%
they need in order to serve their
 
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
customers and that happens every six
 
00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:26.820 align:start position:0%
months they go out into the market they
 
00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
issue an RFP to uh to power generator
 
00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:34.140 align:start position:0%
companies or or entities that buy Power
 
00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:35.700 align:start position:0%
in the market and serve the utilities
 
00:35:39.109 --> 00:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
the utilities do that competitively and
 
00:35:42.109 --> 00:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
then they procure energy through those
 
00:35:42.119 --> 00:35:45.470 align:start position:0%
then they procure energy through those
rfps

00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:48.109 --> 00:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
representative Summers has a question
 
00:35:50.930 --> 00:35:50.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh with the
 
00:35:53.329 --> 00:35:53.339 align:start position:0%
transmission rates being so high and
 
00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:55.380 align:start position:0%
part of it and with the utilities that
 
00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
can actually control the transmission
 
00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:00.060 align:start position:0%
can the transmission costs be divested
 
00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:02.820 align:start position:0%
or spread amongst years to bring that
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:11.690 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:11.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
the the transmission rates are again
 
00:36:18.010 --> 00:36:18.020 align:start position:0%
um part of the the folk responsibility
 
00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:21.180 align:start position:0%
so ultimately it's the iso New England
 
00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:22.310 align:start position:0%
so ultimately it's the iso New England
that

00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
um is running the transmission grid and
 
00:36:28.329 --> 00:36:28.339 align:start position:0%
so those costs are again
 
00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:33.599 align:start position:0%
bypass so I'm not 100 sure whether
 
00:36:36.109 --> 00:36:36.119 align:start position:0%
um if you're asking you know whether we
 
00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:38.220 align:start position:0%
can do something about sort of breaking
 
00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:41.820 align:start position:0%
up those companies but they are under
 
00:36:44.089 --> 00:36:44.099 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of the you know the
 
00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:46.140 align:start position:0%
folk jurisdiction
 
00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
um it's possible that a particular
 
00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:52.740 align:start position:0%
transmission utility company may be also
 
00:36:55.069 --> 00:36:55.079 align:start position:0%
the one that owns distribution
 
00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
yeah you know utilities here
 
00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:00.140 align:start position:0%
but I think
 
00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:02.820 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question but I really
 
00:37:05.329 --> 00:37:05.339 align:start position:0%
need to think through whether that can
 
00:37:07.250 --> 00:37:07.260 align:start position:0%
be even done uh asking transmission
 
00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:11.940 align:start position:0%
companies to be divested uh separately
 
00:37:13.609 --> 00:37:13.619 align:start position:0%
um I would add that
 
00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:15.660 align:start position:0%
ISO New England has a responsibility
 
00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:17.720 align:start position:0%
under the federal power act for
 
00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:19.630 align:start position:0%
under the federal power act for
transmission

00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:19.640 align:start position:0%
transmission
 
00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
planning so they develop the forecast on
 
00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:24.260 align:start position:0%
what's needed for transmission
 
00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and then the the
 
00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
transmission utilities they're regulated
 
00:37:30.829 --> 00:37:30.839 align:start position:0%
by the Federal Energy Regulatory
 
00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:32.940 align:start position:0%
Commission because today
 
00:37:35.329 --> 00:37:35.339 align:start position:0%
transmission is in interstate commerce
 
00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
it hap it occurs over state lines so
 
00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
it's outside of the regulatory authority
 
00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:42.900 align:start position:0%
of the states or our commission it's
 
00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:44.220 align:start position:0%
regulated by the Federal Energy
 
00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:48.370 align:start position:0%
regulated by the Federal Energy
Commission

00:37:48.370 --> 00:37:48.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:51.290 --> 00:37:51.300 align:start position:0%
representative Noel has a question thank
 
00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh just a point of
 
00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:55.140 align:start position:0%
clarification when you're talking about
 
00:37:56.810 --> 00:37:56.820 align:start position:0%
the utilities you're talking about the
 
00:37:58.609 --> 00:37:58.619 align:start position:0%
transmission companies
 
00:38:01.450 --> 00:38:01.460 align:start position:0%
I I'm using that word generally speaking
 
00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:04.260 align:start position:0%
there are distribution utilities that we
 
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
regulate and there are transmission
 
00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
utilities that are generally speaking
 
00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:10.079 align:start position:0%
regulated by the Federal Energy
 
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
Regulatory Commission
 
00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:14.700 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
 
00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:16.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:38:19.609 --> 00:38:19.619 align:start position:0%
does anybody address the issue or
 
00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:21.540 align:start position:0%
regulation with the generators the ones
 
00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:23.640 align:start position:0%
who actually provide the power to the
 
00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:26.460 align:start position:0%
distribution companies or utilities so
 
00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:29.700 align:start position:0%
States retain regulation over power
 
00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:32.700 align:start position:0%
generation it the the when we talk about
 
00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
regulation it primarily is citing that
 
00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:40.200 align:start position:0%
when you are looking to develop a power
 
00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:42.900 align:start position:0%
generation resource it there's a citing
 
00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:46.020 align:start position:0%
process to to get that facility a permit
 
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
so they can be constructed and operate
 
00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:49.810 align:start position:0%
so they can be constructed and operate
safely

00:38:49.810 --> 00:38:49.820 align:start position:0%
safely
 
00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:52.140 align:start position:0%
so that is regulated by the site
 
00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:54.540 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee the three of us are
 
00:38:56.210 --> 00:38:56.220 align:start position:0%
members of the site evaluation Committee
 
00:38:59.030 --> 00:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
in addition to six other members some of
 
00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:00.900 align:start position:0%
whom are state employees like the
 
00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:01.980 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation
 
00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:03.780 align:start position:0%
commissioner but we also have public
 
00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:06.440 align:start position:0%
members so in New Hampshire the SEC
 
00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:09.540 align:start position:0%
oversees the the certificates that
 
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
develop uh
 
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
or that would be provided to power
 
00:39:16.609 --> 00:39:16.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:19.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
00:39:22.849 --> 00:39:22.859 align:start position:0%
directing or or identifying when there
 
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
are needs of power generation that is uh
 
00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:28.140 align:start position:0%
primarily handled by ISO New England
 
00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
because they're operating the regional
 
00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:38.180 align:start position:0%
on questions about rate setting because
 
00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
commissioner Simpson is going to talk
 
00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:42.780 align:start position:0%
about that later in the presentation I
 
00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:44.089 align:start position:0%
about that later in the presentation I
believe

00:39:44.089 --> 00:39:44.099 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
yeah I I will be but oh okay sorry I
 
00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:56.810 --> 00:39:56.820 align:start position:0%
thank you just uh wrapping up my portion
 
00:39:58.609 --> 00:39:58.619 align:start position:0%
of the presentation just two more slides
 
00:39:59.690 --> 00:39:59.700 align:start position:0%
and then I'll turn it over to
 
00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner Chota batai who will then
 
00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
turn it over to commissioner Simpson I'd
 
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
just to briefly go over the commission
 
00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:09.180 align:start position:0%
uh code of ethics so
 
00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
um the Commissioners and staff can can
 
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
generally speak writer lecture
 
00:40:15.109 --> 00:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
concerning the regulatory process
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire for example this this
 
00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:19.740 align:start position:0%
session today but at the same time there
 
00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:21.780 align:start position:0%
are strict prohibitions on ex parte
 
00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
Communications in cases pending before
 
00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
us neither the Commissioners nor the
 
00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
staff of the commission can publicly
 
00:40:30.349 --> 00:40:30.359 align:start position:0%
comment about a matter pending before
 
00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:33.540 align:start position:0%
the commission so that that sometimes
 
00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:35.700 align:start position:0%
comes into play when we're we're talking
 
00:40:37.069 --> 00:40:37.079 align:start position:0%
to folks
 
00:40:39.829 --> 00:40:39.839 align:start position:0%
okay so my final slide is just relative
 
00:40:41.569 --> 00:40:41.579 align:start position:0%
to communication
 
00:40:41.579 --> 00:40:43.609 align:start position:0%
to communication
um our

00:40:43.609 --> 00:40:43.619 align:start position:0%
um our
 
00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
um our webpage is uh I think it's an
 
00:40:49.310 --> 00:40:49.320 align:start position:0%
excellent reviews however we're also
 
00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:51.540 align:start position:0%
moving over to sort of the state format
 
00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
so the format you'll see out there today
 
00:40:56.450 --> 00:40:56.460 align:start position:0%
for another couple of months is the um
 
00:40:58.370 --> 00:40:58.380 align:start position:0%
is the existing format that's been in
 
00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:01.140 align:start position:0%
place for many years I think folks
 
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
generally like it it's pretty easy to
 
00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
find things and and locate what you need
 
00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:06.020 align:start position:0%
to out there
 
00:41:08.569 --> 00:41:08.579 align:start position:0%
and again in a couple of months we'll
 
00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
we'll uh we'll be on the new website
 
00:41:13.609 --> 00:41:13.619 align:start position:0%
um and uh you know our encouragement
 
00:41:15.589 --> 00:41:15.599 align:start position:0%
would be to go out there and poke around
 
00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:17.700 align:start position:0%
and look at look at the dockets and
 
00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:19.260 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of useful information out
 
00:41:21.829 --> 00:41:21.839 align:start position:0%
there and it's really part of our work
 
00:41:25.069 --> 00:41:25.079 align:start position:0%
to provide a transparent process for the
 
00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
for the Public Utilities Commission so
 
00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:30.420 align:start position:0%
with that I'll turn over to commissioner
 
00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
for his section I can just flip the
 
00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:33.589 align:start position:0%
for his section I can just flip the
slides

00:41:33.589 --> 00:41:33.599 align:start position:0%
slides
 
00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:36.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:40.140 align:start position:0%
so I think it's slide 13 Maybe
 
00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:41.930 align:start position:0%
so I think it's slide 13 Maybe
12.

00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:41.940 align:start position:0%
12.
 
00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:43.690 align:start position:0%
12.
um

00:41:43.690 --> 00:41:43.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:47.220 align:start position:0%
so I I will keep this pretty high level
 
00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:50.940 align:start position:0%
as you would imagine rate setting is a
 
00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
fairly complicated process
 
00:41:56.349 --> 00:41:56.359 align:start position:0%
um so the first thing I will note is
 
00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
that the the biggest chunk of rate
 
00:42:02.650 --> 00:42:02.660 align:start position:0%
making happens
 
00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:05.940 align:start position:0%
with respect to distribution rates so
 
00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
when a Distribution Company files a rate
 
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
case it requests rates particular rates
 
00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
and there is this adjudicative process
 
00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
which ends up being which ends up
 
00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
resulting in the commission ultimately
 
00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
recommending or or you know
 
00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:28.980 align:start position:0%
approving rates so that's the process so
 
00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:32.460 align:start position:0%
this this slide just tries to get into
 
00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:35.640 align:start position:0%
at a high level what it is the
 
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
distribution rates
 
00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
um really try to capture essentially
 
00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
there's the concept of Revenue
 
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
requirement that a company needs and I'm
 
00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
talking about a Distribution Company
 
00:42:49.609 --> 00:42:49.619 align:start position:0%
um that is the the operating and
 
00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
maintenance expenses it's uh
 
00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:54.780 align:start position:0%
depreciation and amortization all of
 
00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:56.210 align:start position:0%
depreciation and amortization all of
that

00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:56.220 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:42:59.089 --> 00:42:59.099 align:start position:0%
they also have to pay taxes
 
00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
and an important piece is really what
 
00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
return they will get on the rate base
 
00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
meaning the the and I'm going to use a
 
00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:08.770 align:start position:0%
meaning the the and I'm going to use a
very

00:43:08.770 --> 00:43:08.780 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:43:11.349 --> 00:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
without being
 
00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:14.700 align:start position:0%
precise about it the plans and capital
 
00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:16.740 align:start position:0%
that they put into place
 
00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
that helps them provide electricity
 
00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:24.420 align:start position:0%
service a distribution service that you
 
00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
can call that the rate base and they get
 
00:43:29.329 --> 00:43:29.339 align:start position:0%
a return on it so it's like any other if
 
00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:31.740 align:start position:0%
you think about private companies they
 
00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:34.020 align:start position:0%
they invest they expect that they're
 
00:43:35.809 --> 00:43:35.819 align:start position:0%
going to get some profits and then
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
return on it so this is that return is
 
00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:43.020 align:start position:0%
also adjudicated and a rate of return
 
00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:46.380 align:start position:0%
rather and um it is applied on the rate
 
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
base to get them their earnings so to
 
00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
speak so that's how the process is and
 
00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:55.140 align:start position:0%
and and underneath that then you have
 
00:43:58.190 --> 00:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
different billing determinants that are
 
00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
used to figure out what exactly the
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
rates are going to be say for example
 
00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:05.640 align:start position:0%
per kilowatt hour per customer things
 
00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
like that
 
00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:07.970 align:start position:0%
like that
okay

00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:07.980 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:09.829 align:start position:0%
okay
please

00:44:09.829 --> 00:44:09.839 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:11.700 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas has a question
 
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:16.380 align:start position:0%
taking my question again I have to ask
 
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
the question because of the chatter on
 
00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:21.540 align:start position:0%
Facebook to people uh talking about rate
 
00:44:26.650 --> 00:44:26.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:29.640 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding on the actual rate of
 
00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:33.960 align:start position:0%
returns they they say utilities get 12
 
00:44:38.089 --> 00:44:38.099 align:start position:0%
15 percent uh but in in relation to that
 
00:44:38.099 --> 00:44:39.370 align:start position:0%
15 percent uh but in in relation to that
comment

00:44:39.370 --> 00:44:39.380 align:start position:0%
comment
 
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
how do you I I know there's a small
 
00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:44.460 align:start position:0%
range that you can determine for the
 
00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
rate of return so how do you determine
 
00:44:50.329 --> 00:44:50.339 align:start position:0%
particularly in these high cost times
 
00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:53.000 align:start position:0%
how do you determine what rate of return
 
00:44:55.609 --> 00:44:55.619 align:start position:0%
that they should get on this next rate
 
00:44:58.010 --> 00:44:58.020 align:start position:0%
hike particularly when the rate hike is
 
00:45:00.829 --> 00:45:00.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:00.839 --> 00:45:02.210 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:02.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:05.290 --> 00:45:05.300 align:start position:0%
I will refrain from
 
00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
speaking about
 
00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
how things should be done for example in
 
00:45:12.349 --> 00:45:12.359 align:start position:0%
that environment when if a rate case
 
00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
comes to me but let me talk about it
 
00:45:19.250 --> 00:45:19.260 align:start position:0%
generally and I I would I I would let
 
00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:22.260 align:start position:0%
folks know that I used to be the return
 
00:45:26.450 --> 00:45:26.460 align:start position:0%
on Equity expert for the POC as well as
 
00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
for the Office of Consumer advocate so
 
00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:30.180 align:start position:0%
let me talk generally
 
00:45:33.050 --> 00:45:33.060 align:start position:0%
so so what happens is
 
00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
um in you have the investors would look
 
00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
at like this is how much money I have I
 
00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
want to invest in different Ventures and
 
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.849 align:start position:0%
want to invest in different Ventures and
you

00:45:43.849 --> 00:45:43.859 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
um you as an investor you might decide
 
00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
to invest in an utility
 
00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
but what return should you get on it
 
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
it's really largely uh driven by
 
00:45:58.930 --> 00:45:58.940 align:start position:0%
um the the the the
 
00:46:02.089 --> 00:46:02.099 align:start position:0%
competition across all investors they
 
00:46:04.849 --> 00:46:04.859 align:start position:0%
are kind of revealing the opportunity
 
00:46:08.450 --> 00:46:08.460 align:start position:0%
cost of their business or what their
 
00:46:13.130 --> 00:46:13.140 align:start position:0%
money so that is done through a process
 
00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:15.240 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty complicated process we
 
00:46:19.490 --> 00:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
look at a sample of different utilities
 
00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:21.720 align:start position:0%
at the and we look at how the financial
 
00:46:25.069 --> 00:46:25.079 align:start position:0%
markets are operating and you use
 
00:46:28.010 --> 00:46:28.020 align:start position:0%
um for example you will use a discounted
 
00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:30.780 align:start position:0%
cash flow approach to come up with you
 
00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:33.780 align:start position:0%
know what really are the investors
 
00:46:35.690 --> 00:46:35.700 align:start position:0%
actually getting at this point in time
 
00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
and that's what an analyst would do look
 
00:46:41.089 --> 00:46:41.099 align:start position:0%
at those things and say you know what in
 
00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
this current environment the return
 
00:46:45.290 --> 00:46:45.300 align:start position:0%
should be this much for the distribution
 
00:46:47.690 --> 00:46:47.700 align:start position:0%
utilities so that's how the process
 
00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:49.609 align:start position:0%
utilities so that's how the process
works

00:46:49.609 --> 00:46:49.619 align:start position:0%
works
 
00:46:49.619 --> 00:46:50.170 align:start position:0%
works
um

00:46:50.170 --> 00:46:50.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:54.109 --> 00:46:54.119 align:start position:0%
sorry um and and what what you're asking
 
00:46:56.990 --> 00:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
about the rates going high that is the
 
00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's possible I mean it's a
 
00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
fair question it's possible that
 
00:47:09.109 --> 00:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
because of that the distribution the
 
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
return on distribution uh investment may
 
00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:15.540 align:start position:0%
actually get impacted in the market and
 
00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:19.260 align:start position:0%
whether that seeps through the analysis
 
00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
when you look at a proxy set of
 
00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
companies and do your DCF component
 
00:47:26.690 --> 00:47:26.700 align:start position:0%
analysis that I I can't speak to at this
 
00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:29.150 align:start position:0%
analysis that I I can't speak to at this
point

00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for the follow-up I I'm not I
 
00:47:37.010 --> 00:47:37.020 align:start position:0%
may have asked the wrong question uh but
 
00:47:40.130 --> 00:47:40.140 align:start position:0%
maybe um it doesn't matter I was really
 
00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
talking about what establishes the
 
00:47:46.370 --> 00:47:46.380 align:start position:0%
profit margin for the utility per se is
 
00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
is that the same thing as what you just
 
00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:54.440 align:start position:0%
described yes oh okay thank you yeah
 
00:47:57.410 --> 00:47:57.420 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question if
 
00:47:59.750 --> 00:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
you want to elaborate on that yeah I can
 
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
elaborate and then turn it over if
 
00:48:03.290 --> 00:48:03.300 align:start position:0%
that's okay
 
00:48:05.690 --> 00:48:05.700 align:start position:0%
um so it's uh it's helpful to think of
 
00:48:07.370 --> 00:48:07.380 align:start position:0%
it in buckets so you have the supply
 
00:48:10.309 --> 00:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
bucket which is the fundamentally the
 
00:48:11.690 --> 00:48:11.700 align:start position:0%
pass-through that we were talking about
 
00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:15.300 align:start position:0%
earlier where there is no profit margin
 
00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:18.060 align:start position:0%
that's on the supply side you have the
 
00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:19.980 align:start position:0%
transmission side and then you have the
 
00:48:21.349 --> 00:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
distribution side which is what
 
00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner choto Pattaya was talking
 
00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
about in this fancy equation you see at
 
00:48:27.349 --> 00:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
the top of the sheet it's illustrative I
 
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
know it's complicated and a little
 
00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
confusing when you look at it but I just
 
00:48:35.450 --> 00:48:35.460 align:start position:0%
like to say that when you look at this
 
00:48:37.569 --> 00:48:37.579 align:start position:0%
is for the distribution utility alone
 
00:48:40.849 --> 00:48:40.859 align:start position:0%
that this particular equation and the
 
00:48:42.530 --> 00:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
weighted average cost of capital the
 
00:48:43.970 --> 00:48:43.980 align:start position:0%
commissioner shutter but I was talking
 
00:48:46.370 --> 00:48:46.380 align:start position:0%
about is with respect to only the
 
00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
capital portion of that of that of the
 
00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
distribution utility there's lots of
 
00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:53.460 align:start position:0%
other things in there like their
 
00:48:55.309 --> 00:48:55.319 align:start position:0%
overhead costs these other things where
 
00:48:58.069 --> 00:48:58.079 align:start position:0%
there's no return on that so it's
 
00:48:59.510 --> 00:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
important to sort of break it into the
 
00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
component pieces and I know we've been
 
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
talking about Supply and the return on
 
00:49:04.970 --> 00:49:04.980 align:start position:0%
Supply and the return on the
 
00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:06.420 align:start position:0%
distribution utilities and I just wanted
 
00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:09.480 align:start position:0%
to segment between those two
 
00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:10.690 align:start position:0%
to segment between those two
foreign

[Music]

00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
so the utilities and I I have a few
 
00:49:19.550 --> 00:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
slides about some of these underlying
 
00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:22.260 align:start position:0%
principles but the utilities make money
 
00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
on capital investment the the utility
 
00:49:28.490 --> 00:49:28.500 align:start position:0%
plant that they invest in and build the
 
00:49:30.410 --> 00:49:30.420 align:start position:0%
wire that they hang on the polls the
 
00:49:32.089 --> 00:49:32.099 align:start position:0%
polls that they put in the ground the
 
00:49:35.089 --> 00:49:35.099 align:start position:0%
Transformers on the pole the gas main
 
00:49:36.890 --> 00:49:36.900 align:start position:0%
that's in the ground the water pipe
 
00:49:38.329 --> 00:49:38.339 align:start position:0%
that's in the ground the physical
 
00:49:41.569 --> 00:49:41.579 align:start position:0%
infrastructure what they spend on that
 
00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:43.740 align:start position:0%
physical infrastructure is what they
 
00:49:46.910 --> 00:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
earn their return on those returns when
 
00:49:50.329 --> 00:49:50.339 align:start position:0%
we gauge whether a utility should be
 
00:49:52.250 --> 00:49:52.260 align:start position:0%
entitled to an eight and a half percent
 
00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:55.020 align:start position:0%
return on that money that they spent on
 
00:49:58.670 --> 00:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
capital or a nine percent or a 9.5 the
 
00:50:01.069 --> 00:50:01.079 align:start position:0%
utility comes in in a rate case and they
 
00:50:03.530 --> 00:50:03.540 align:start position:0%
present what's called a proxy group and
 
00:50:06.410 --> 00:50:06.420 align:start position:0%
they show a proxy group of similarly
 
00:50:08.450 --> 00:50:08.460 align:start position:0%
situated utilities across the country
 
00:50:11.089 --> 00:50:11.099 align:start position:0%
whether it's gas electric water and they
 
00:50:13.490 --> 00:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that in other states this is
 
00:50:16.550 --> 00:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
what a similarly situated utility earns
 
00:50:18.530 --> 00:50:18.540 align:start position:0%
for a return on investment and why
 
00:50:20.809 --> 00:50:20.819 align:start position:0%
that's relevant is because these are
 
00:50:23.089 --> 00:50:23.099 align:start position:0%
incredibly Capital intensive businesses
 
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
they borrow hundreds of millions if not
 
00:50:28.309 --> 00:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
billions of dollars per year when they
 
00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:31.800 align:start position:0%
go to financial markets like financial
 
00:50:35.569 --> 00:50:35.579 align:start position:0%
institutions large Banks to borrow money
 
00:50:38.210 --> 00:50:38.220 align:start position:0%
the interest rate on which they can
 
00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
borrow money
 
00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:42.180 align:start position:0%
varies based on the regulatory
 
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
environment and one of the factors
 
00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
that's heavily weighed by the financial
 
00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:48.900 align:start position:0%
Community is the return on investment
 
00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
and this is fundamentally one of the
 
00:50:54.109 --> 00:50:54.119 align:start position:0%
biggest struggles as Regulators when you
 
00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
saw earlier that our logo is the scale
 
00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:01.140 align:start position:0%
of justice and that RSA 363 designates
 
00:51:03.650 --> 00:51:03.660 align:start position:0%
us as the Arbiter to balance the
 
00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
interest between the utilities and the
 
00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
customers and we have to consider all of
 
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
these factors when we set rates when we
 
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
set earnings to understand how do we
 
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
Foster healthy utilities that can borrow
 
00:51:20.809 --> 00:51:20.819 align:start position:0%
and Access Capital in the markets at
 
00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:23.640 align:start position:0%
competitive rates versus the significant
 
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
impacts that that has on your
 
00:51:27.950 --> 00:51:27.960 align:start position:0%
constituents and customers in the state
 
00:51:30.589 --> 00:51:30.599 align:start position:0%
that's that is ultimately the challenge
 
00:51:32.450 --> 00:51:32.460 align:start position:0%
that we face in our roles as rate
 
00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:33.770 align:start position:0%
that we face in our roles as rate
regulators

00:51:33.770 --> 00:51:33.780 align:start position:0%
regulators
 
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
that's a good explanation thank you
 
00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question thank
 
00:51:41.569 --> 00:51:41.579 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and um I you you may have
 
00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
answered some of my question already
 
00:51:46.490 --> 00:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
um but just I want to clarify when you
 
00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
talk about the the the the rate of
 
00:51:53.690 --> 00:51:53.700 align:start position:0%
return being tied to the return that
 
00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
um investors can get in other
 
00:51:58.670 --> 00:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
uh Investments I mean that would include
 
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
the stock market for example
 
00:52:03.589 --> 00:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
um but then commissioner Simpson you
 
00:52:06.109 --> 00:52:06.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned that um it's it or you implied
 
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
and correct me if I'm wrong that it was
 
00:52:13.130 --> 00:52:13.140 align:start position:0%
tied more to the the cost of debt
 
00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:14.150 align:start position:0%
tied more to the the cost of debt
um

00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:15.950 --> 00:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
you know I guess what I'm trying to
 
00:52:17.690 --> 00:52:17.700 align:start position:0%
understand is
 
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
how much do fluctuations in the stock
 
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
market and fluctuations in you know what
 
00:52:25.490 --> 00:52:25.500 align:start position:0%
the FED is doing in terms of raising
 
00:52:27.589 --> 00:52:27.599 align:start position:0%
interest rates how much does that have
 
00:52:30.770 --> 00:52:30.780 align:start position:0%
an impact on the rate of return and and
 
00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:33.780 align:start position:0%
and you know assuming it's assuming it
 
00:52:37.130 --> 00:52:37.140 align:start position:0%
does do you do you adjust the the
 
00:52:39.650 --> 00:52:39.660 align:start position:0%
allowed return in this equation based on
 
00:52:41.569 --> 00:52:41.579 align:start position:0%
what's going on in those markets the the
 
00:52:44.210 --> 00:52:44.220 align:start position:0%
answer is yes and that it affects both
 
00:52:45.770 --> 00:52:45.780 align:start position:0%
of the items that you just articulated
 
00:52:48.650 --> 00:52:48.660 align:start position:0%
cost to Capital cost of debt
 
00:52:51.170 --> 00:52:51.180 align:start position:0%
um there are many factors that we have
 
00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
to weigh in that analysis and it boils
 
00:52:57.109 --> 00:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
down to when financial institutions look
 
00:52:59.270 --> 00:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
at Investments they have different areas
 
00:53:01.010 --> 00:53:01.020 align:start position:0%
with which they invest to diversify
 
00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
their portfolios one of those is
 
00:53:05.809 --> 00:53:05.819 align:start position:0%
utilities so the question for them is do
 
00:53:08.569 --> 00:53:08.579 align:start position:0%
I invest my money in a utility in New
 
00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or do I invest my money in a
 
00:53:16.309 --> 00:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
utility in Massachusetts or Utah
 
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
and that's based on these these uh
 
00:53:21.049 --> 00:53:21.059 align:start position:0%
factors that we consider in the rate
 
00:53:23.210 --> 00:53:23.220 align:start position:0%
making process but my colleague is the
 
00:53:25.609 --> 00:53:25.619 align:start position:0%
PHD in economics and an expert so he can
 
00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:27.839 align:start position:0%
collaborate further so again I'll try to
 
00:53:29.690 --> 00:53:29.700 align:start position:0%
keep it simple
 
00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:31.370 align:start position:0%
keep it simple
um

00:53:31.370 --> 00:53:31.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:34.549 --> 00:53:34.559 align:start position:0%
an investor when I say an investor
 
00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
um they are interested in spending their
 
00:53:39.290 --> 00:53:39.300 align:start position:0%
own money that is kind of equity it's
 
00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
not debt for an utility it's trying to
 
00:53:46.370 --> 00:53:46.380 align:start position:0%
attract investors and it also has the
 
00:53:48.770 --> 00:53:48.780 align:start position:0%
ability to go to the debt market and get
 
00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:51.240 align:start position:0%
you know through say bonds or whatever
 
00:53:56.510 --> 00:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
and they too have to be mindful of what
 
00:53:59.690 --> 00:53:59.700 align:start position:0%
mix of debt and Equity they should
 
00:54:03.490 --> 00:54:03.500 align:start position:0%
Target and that also becomes part of the
 
00:54:06.829 --> 00:54:06.839 align:start position:0%
analysis when we are setting the
 
00:54:09.410 --> 00:54:09.420 align:start position:0%
weighted cost of capital what is the
 
00:54:12.530 --> 00:54:12.540 align:start position:0%
just uh and reasonable return so that's
 
00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
that becomes part of the Analytics
 
00:54:19.490 --> 00:54:19.500 align:start position:0%
follow-up uh so just a a follow-up given
 
00:54:22.549 --> 00:54:22.559 align:start position:0%
what's going on right now where the the
 
00:54:25.370 --> 00:54:25.380 align:start position:0%
stock market uh performance has gone
 
00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
South which you know I regret every time
 
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
I look at my bank statement
 
00:54:33.890 --> 00:54:33.900 align:start position:0%
um and the cost of cap the cost of debt
 
00:54:35.690 --> 00:54:35.700 align:start position:0%
is going up because the FED is raising
 
00:54:39.290 --> 00:54:39.300 align:start position:0%
the rates any sense of what that's going
 
00:54:41.089 --> 00:54:41.099 align:start position:0%
to mean in terms of the allowed return
 
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
is that going to like drive it down
 
00:54:47.329 --> 00:54:47.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:47.339 --> 00:54:48.069 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:54:48.069 --> 00:54:48.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:51.710 --> 00:54:51.720 align:start position:0%
depends on the specifics of a particular
 
00:54:54.770 --> 00:54:54.780 align:start position:0%
let's say filing but again speaking
 
00:54:54.780 --> 00:54:57.410 align:start position:0%
let's say filing but again speaking
generally

00:54:57.410 --> 00:54:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:57.420 --> 00:54:59.210 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:54:59.210 --> 00:54:59.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:01.309 --> 00:55:01.319 align:start position:0%
let's say if you have an environment
 
00:55:03.829 --> 00:55:03.839 align:start position:0%
where the the interest rates on debt is
 
00:55:07.069 --> 00:55:07.079 align:start position:0%
pretty low right so you might end up
 
00:55:09.650 --> 00:55:09.660 align:start position:0%
concluding in this environment it's okay
 
00:55:13.069 --> 00:55:13.079 align:start position:0%
to go a little bit more debt then so the
 
00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:15.780 align:start position:0%
the weightage might be different and
 
00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:17.089 align:start position:0%
the weightage might be different and
ultimately

00:55:17.089 --> 00:55:17.099 align:start position:0%
ultimately
 
00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
you have to keep in mind that when as a
 
00:55:24.170 --> 00:55:24.180 align:start position:0%
neutrality you are getting money from an
 
00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:27.839 align:start position:0%
investor or Equity you know post as an
 
00:55:27.839 --> 00:55:29.270 align:start position:0%
investor or Equity you know post as an
equity

00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
equity
 
00:55:32.809 --> 00:55:32.819 align:start position:0%
um that receives less priority
 
00:55:35.870 --> 00:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
compared to the debt instrument that I
 
00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
might be involved in so if I have to
 
00:55:40.849 --> 00:55:40.859 align:start position:0%
return I have to give money to people I
 
00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
have to prioritize debt so that issue
 
00:55:46.069 --> 00:55:46.079 align:start position:0%
also comes into play and so
 
00:55:48.170 --> 00:55:48.180 align:start position:0%
um in in an environment where the debt
 
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
the the debt rate is going up quite a
 
00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:51.170 align:start position:0%
the the debt rate is going up quite a
bit

00:55:51.170 --> 00:55:51.180 align:start position:0%
bit
 
00:55:53.930 --> 00:55:53.940 align:start position:0%
you might say you know what
 
00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:54.609 align:start position:0%
you might say you know what
um

00:55:54.609 --> 00:55:54.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:57.349 --> 00:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
maybe the mix isn't
 
00:55:59.690 --> 00:55:59.700 align:start position:0%
um what we have right now
 
00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
and that's why I said it depends on the
 
00:56:04.190 --> 00:56:04.200 align:start position:0%
specifics so and it maybe we can go a
 
00:56:07.730 --> 00:56:07.740 align:start position:0%
little bit more equity which is fine
 
00:56:10.089 --> 00:56:10.099 align:start position:0%
um but but
 
00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
because I don't want to be exposed to
 
00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:16.559 align:start position:0%
the to the to the prioritized you know
 
00:56:18.890 --> 00:56:18.900 align:start position:0%
commitment that I have for for debt
 
00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:20.089 align:start position:0%
commitment that I have for for debt
instruments

00:56:20.089 --> 00:56:20.099 align:start position:0%
instruments
 
00:56:21.790 --> 00:56:21.800 align:start position:0%
so it's complicated
 
00:56:23.770 --> 00:56:23.780 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:56:25.790 --> 00:56:25.800 align:start position:0%
representative partial did you have a
 
00:56:28.430 --> 00:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
question okay thank you all right
 
00:56:35.569 --> 00:56:35.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
so like I'm just making sure I've
 
00:56:42.170 --> 00:56:42.180 align:start position:0%
covered yep okay and um so but I want to
 
00:56:46.910 --> 00:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
also add that as you go to slide 13 that
 
00:56:48.650 --> 00:56:48.660 align:start position:0%
rate setting is not simply about
 
00:56:51.230 --> 00:56:51.240 align:start position:0%
distribution rates okay
 
00:56:53.030 --> 00:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
um in fact are the rates impact
 
00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
customers electricity gas water sewer
 
00:56:58.549 --> 00:56:58.559 align:start position:0%
and Telecommunications bills and it goes
 
00:57:01.730 --> 00:57:01.740 align:start position:0%
back to for example the as an example
 
00:57:04.609 --> 00:57:04.619 align:start position:0%
the energy Supply component right and
 
00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
it's important for those other other
 
00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:08.630 align:start position:0%
it's important for those other other
components

00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
components
 
00:57:10.790 --> 00:57:10.800 align:start position:0%
we have to still be mindful of whether
 
00:57:13.309 --> 00:57:13.319 align:start position:0%
the the utility has asked the proper
 
00:57:15.170 --> 00:57:15.180 align:start position:0%
rates ultimately it's about billing
 
00:57:17.569 --> 00:57:17.579 align:start position:0%
determinants you know whether a
 
00:57:18.890 --> 00:57:18.900 align:start position:0%
particular rate design is the right
 
00:57:21.950 --> 00:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
approach things like that so they imp
 
00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
they influence
 
00:57:26.690 --> 00:57:26.700 align:start position:0%
um you know there are things like System
 
00:57:29.569 --> 00:57:29.579 align:start position:0%
benefit charges uh there's stranded cost
 
00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
charges and there are these those
 
00:57:33.370 --> 00:57:33.380 align:start position:0%
pass-through rates that I talked about
 
00:57:36.109 --> 00:57:36.119 align:start position:0%
they also have to be looked at by the by
 
00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
the commission and that happens
 
00:57:42.349 --> 00:57:42.359 align:start position:0%
in my opinion more frequently than we
 
00:57:46.069 --> 00:57:46.079 align:start position:0%
think it uh you know does perhaps
 
00:57:47.569 --> 00:57:47.579 align:start position:0%
because there's all kinds of
 
00:57:50.089 --> 00:57:50.099 align:start position:0%
reconciliation processes put in place
 
00:57:52.849 --> 00:57:52.859 align:start position:0%
and to be clear and I'm going back to
 
00:57:55.130 --> 00:57:55.140 align:start position:0%
the the this the point that uh
 
00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:56.650 align:start position:0%
the the this the point that uh
commissioner

00:57:56.650 --> 00:57:56.660 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:57:59.150 --> 00:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
Simpson was mentioning
 
00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:00.770 align:start position:0%
Simpson was mentioning
um

00:58:00.770 --> 00:58:00.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:03.349 --> 00:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
as far as the rate base that I mentioned
 
00:58:05.450 --> 00:58:05.460 align:start position:0%
in the previous slide that is really
 
00:58:08.030 --> 00:58:08.040 align:start position:0%
about distribution companies that is
 
00:58:10.370 --> 00:58:10.380 align:start position:0%
about the physical assets that those
 
00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
companies need to be able to uh provide
 
00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:15.170 align:start position:0%
companies need to be able to uh provide
service

00:58:15.170 --> 00:58:15.180 align:start position:0%
service
 
00:58:17.450 --> 00:58:17.460 align:start position:0%
that's that's one category so they
 
00:58:19.730 --> 00:58:19.740 align:start position:0%
expect a return on it based on you know
 
00:58:22.309 --> 00:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
this uh sort of the capitalist economy
 
00:58:22.319 --> 00:58:23.390 align:start position:0%
this uh sort of the capitalist economy
here

00:58:23.390 --> 00:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:23.990 align:start position:0%
here
um

00:58:23.990 --> 00:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:27.250 --> 00:58:27.260 align:start position:0%
for the other rates the utility is not
 
00:58:30.109 --> 00:58:30.119 align:start position:0%
expected to or allowed to have any
 
00:58:33.650 --> 00:58:33.660 align:start position:0%
return those are just pass-throughs so
 
00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:39.950 --> 00:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
you have a question representative
 
00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:41.630 align:start position:0%
you have a question representative
Summers

00:58:41.630 --> 00:58:41.640 align:start position:0%
Summers
 
00:58:43.430 --> 00:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:58:44.930 --> 00:58:44.940 align:start position:0%
um and thank you commissioner for taking
 
00:58:46.789 --> 00:58:46.799 align:start position:0%
these questions in fact being an
 
00:58:48.109 --> 00:58:48.119 align:start position:0%
economist you're probably the perfect
 
00:58:50.150 --> 00:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
person to answer this question for me
 
00:58:52.309 --> 00:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
one thing and maybe we completely
 
00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
misunderstand this but several folks
 
00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:57.240 align:start position:0%
have spoken to look at it as a business
 
00:58:59.690 --> 00:58:59.700 align:start position:0%
sense and they see you know the common
 
00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
account assets equals liabilities plus
 
00:59:05.170 --> 00:59:05.180 align:start position:0%
equity and so looking at this rate here
 
00:59:10.010 --> 00:59:10.020 align:start position:0%
if does the utility have control of the
 
00:59:12.589 --> 00:59:12.599 align:start position:0%
amount of depreciation to be able
 
00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
because normally depreciation
 
00:59:19.010 --> 00:59:19.020 align:start position:0%
more depreciation you put on right the
 
00:59:21.410 --> 00:59:21.420 align:start position:0%
lower the taxes become which means the
 
00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
lower the rate of return would be needed
 
00:59:25.849 --> 00:59:25.859 align:start position:0%
is it can it be is it run like that do
 
00:59:27.049 --> 00:59:27.059 align:start position:0%
they have control how much they can
 
00:59:29.450 --> 00:59:29.460 align:start position:0%
depreciate or is it regulated to a set
 
00:59:29.460 --> 00:59:32.089 align:start position:0%
depreciate or is it regulated to a set
amount

00:59:32.089 --> 00:59:32.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:32.099 --> 00:59:33.829 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:59:33.829 --> 00:59:33.839 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:59:33.839 --> 00:59:34.789 align:start position:0%
yeah
um

00:59:34.789 --> 00:59:34.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:37.789 --> 00:59:37.799 align:start position:0%
speaking generally and based on my
 
00:59:39.770 --> 00:59:39.780 align:start position:0%
experience and I'm not a depreciation
 
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
expert but I can tell you that
 
00:59:44.809 --> 00:59:44.819 align:start position:0%
um what tends to happen is the the
 
00:59:46.849 --> 00:59:46.859 align:start position:0%
utility would say this is how the
 
00:59:49.250 --> 00:59:49.260 align:start position:0%
depreciation schedule should be and then
 
00:59:51.289 --> 00:59:51.299 align:start position:0%
you'll have the other parties including
 
00:59:53.809 --> 00:59:53.819 align:start position:0%
POC staff I'm going back to the Earth
 
00:59:56.510 --> 00:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
while POC they will say nope that is not
 
00:59:58.849 --> 00:59:58.859 align:start position:0%
the that is not how it should be so
 
01:00:00.650 --> 01:00:00.660 align:start position:0%
there's it's not it's not it and it's
 
01:00:03.410 --> 01:00:03.420 align:start position:0%
not entirely determined by the utility
 
01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
you know there's there's a process there
 
01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:13.010 align:start position:0%
you know there's there's a process there
too

01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:14.450 --> 01:00:14.460 align:start position:0%
continue please
 
01:00:17.150 --> 01:00:17.160 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
I'm going to move on to the topic of
 
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:26.450 --> 01:00:26.460 align:start position:0%
the first
 
01:00:36.109 --> 01:00:36.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
right now in New Hampshire
 
01:00:42.289 --> 01:00:42.299 align:start position:0%
a customer can decide to stay with the
 
01:00:44.890 --> 01:00:44.900 align:start position:0%
utility for their energy portion
 
01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
so use default service pay default
 
01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
Service rates
 
01:00:54.049 --> 01:00:54.059 align:start position:0%
or they can go to a competitive supplier
 
01:00:56.450 --> 01:00:56.460 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:00:58.730 --> 01:00:58.740 align:start position:0%
to the best of my knowledge I think it's
 
01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:01.020 align:start position:0%
been happening for like two two decades
 
01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:02.630 align:start position:0%
been happening for like two two decades
okay

01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:03.710 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:01:03.710 --> 01:01:03.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:05.690 --> 01:01:05.700 align:start position:0%
that's already there
 
01:01:07.849 --> 01:01:07.859 align:start position:0%
a lot of the
 
01:01:10.490 --> 01:01:10.500 align:start position:0%
commercial and Industrial customers I
 
01:01:12.349 --> 01:01:12.359 align:start position:0%
think have already made the switch
 
01:01:14.809 --> 01:01:14.819 align:start position:0%
so very little remains with default
 
01:01:16.910 --> 01:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
service but for residential customers
 
01:01:19.250 --> 01:01:19.260 align:start position:0%
that has not happened to the extent
 
01:01:21.829 --> 01:01:21.839 align:start position:0%
perhaps when
 
01:01:25.870 --> 01:01:25.880 align:start position:0%
the when this move was made
 
01:01:30.589 --> 01:01:30.599 align:start position:0%
the expectation was okay so
 
01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
but it's it's customers do have that
 
01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:34.250 align:start position:0%
but it's it's customers do have that
choice

01:01:34.250 --> 01:01:34.260 align:start position:0%
choice
 
01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:38.220 align:start position:0%
currently we also the commission has
 
01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:39.789 align:start position:0%
currently we also the commission has
um

01:01:39.789 --> 01:01:39.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:42.770 --> 01:01:42.780 align:start position:0%
allowed Community power aggregation and
 
01:01:45.710 --> 01:01:45.720 align:start position:0%
and there has been a proliferation of it
 
01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
and I need to be careful when I say that
 
01:01:50.329 --> 01:01:50.339 align:start position:0%
it's still in the early stages when I
 
01:01:52.870 --> 01:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
say proliferation it really the the
 
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
those towns are
 
01:01:59.030 --> 01:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh submitting petitions okay approve us
 
01:02:01.309 --> 01:02:01.319 align:start position:0%
for Community power application that's
 
01:02:03.829 --> 01:02:03.839 align:start position:0%
happening a lot more and
 
01:02:08.329 --> 01:02:08.339 align:start position:0%
um so that's what I meant that too
 
01:02:10.130 --> 01:02:10.140 align:start position:0%
as an economist I will tell you when
 
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
people have more choices
 
01:02:16.130 --> 01:02:16.140 align:start position:0%
it's good it it puts competitive
 
01:02:21.410 --> 01:02:21.420 align:start position:0%
pressures on prices and and if you have
 
01:02:24.289 --> 01:02:24.299 align:start position:0%
a monopoly service it doesn't have a
 
01:02:26.990 --> 01:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
whole lot of competition then it's it
 
01:02:28.789 --> 01:02:28.799 align:start position:0%
tends to
 
01:02:28.799 --> 01:02:29.710 align:start position:0%
tends to
um

01:02:29.710 --> 01:02:29.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:32.809 --> 01:02:32.819 align:start position:0%
accommodate more inefficiencies so in
 
01:02:37.130 --> 01:02:37.140 align:start position:0%
that sense the that those two moves are
 
01:02:41.569 --> 01:02:41.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:44.990 --> 01:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
but as we were talking about
 
01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
I was also amazed to see the hike in the
 
01:02:50.510 --> 01:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
prices the energy Supply prices right I
 
01:02:53.690 --> 01:02:53.700 align:start position:0%
mean I'm I'm I also consume electricity
 
01:02:55.789 --> 01:02:55.799 align:start position:0%
so it does affect me
 
01:02:59.510 --> 01:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
um and you know it so I I'm on default
 
01:03:02.030 --> 01:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
service right now and I try to think
 
01:03:03.230 --> 01:03:03.240 align:start position:0%
about you know what should I do
 
01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
differently right so I'm sure most
 
01:03:08.329 --> 01:03:08.339 align:start position:0%
people are doing that
 
01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
but it's also a question of what
 
01:03:15.109 --> 01:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
processes are put in place and we as
 
01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
Commissioners we come into it
 
01:03:20.030 --> 01:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
I became a commissionary roughly a year
 
01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:22.559 align:start position:0%
ago there are these processes that are
 
01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
in place we try to follow them and you
 
01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
you come up or you end up
 
01:03:32.450 --> 01:03:32.460 align:start position:0%
facing this situation so then you start
 
01:03:34.490 --> 01:03:34.500 align:start position:0%
asking whether there are things we can
 
01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
do to the processes itself
 
01:03:40.730 --> 01:03:40.740 align:start position:0%
to make it less problematic for the
 
01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:41.630 align:start position:0%
to make it less problematic for the
customers

01:03:41.630 --> 01:03:41.640 align:start position:0%
customers
 
01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:45.540 align:start position:0%
you still have to abide by the statutes
 
01:03:49.069 --> 01:03:49.079 align:start position:0%
we are a restructured state we we the
 
01:03:50.930 --> 01:03:50.940 align:start position:0%
generation is no longer
 
01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
um uh regulated and all of that within
 
01:03:56.990 --> 01:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
that scheme we are there things we can
 
01:03:59.450 --> 01:03:59.460 align:start position:0%
do and that's that's part of what we're
 
01:04:01.309 --> 01:04:01.319 align:start position:0%
trying to do in that uh investigative
 
01:04:03.950 --> 01:04:03.960 align:start position:0%
docket okay so just small so that's my
 
01:04:06.890 --> 01:04:06.900 align:start position:0%
second slide second bullet here
 
01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:08.569 align:start position:0%
second slide second bullet here
um

01:04:08.569 --> 01:04:08.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:11.450 --> 01:04:11.460 align:start position:0%
speaking as an economist keeping things
 
01:04:15.049 --> 01:04:15.059 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:18.890 --> 01:04:18.900 align:start position:0%
and I've been involved in a lot of
 
01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:22.799 align:start position:0%
Regional electric matters
 
01:04:24.490 --> 01:04:24.500 align:start position:0%
um I was
 
01:04:27.650 --> 01:04:27.660 align:start position:0%
one of the analysts for the Public
 
01:04:29.390 --> 01:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
Utility Commission that used to go to
 
01:04:32.030 --> 01:04:32.040 align:start position:0%
the nipple meetings to the ferc and all
 
01:04:35.690 --> 01:04:35.700 align:start position:0%
of that so I mean I can I can tell you
 
01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
from my experience
 
01:04:39.349 --> 01:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
the iso New England Market which is
 
01:04:39.359 --> 01:04:40.370 align:start position:0%
the iso New England Market which is
where

01:04:40.370 --> 01:04:40.380 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:04:43.150 --> 01:04:43.160 align:start position:0%
all of the
 
01:04:45.710 --> 01:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
issues about very high prices is
 
01:04:47.690 --> 01:04:47.700 align:start position:0%
happening right now the energy Supply
 
01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:54.589 --> 01:04:54.599 align:start position:0%
there the focus is
 
01:04:56.270 --> 01:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
is kind of
 
01:04:59.210 --> 01:04:59.220 align:start position:0%
a lot more on the supply side
 
01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:00.890 align:start position:0%
a lot more on the supply side
the

01:05:00.890 --> 01:05:00.900 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:05:03.410 --> 01:05:03.420 align:start position:0%
you know the generating companies things
 
01:05:04.430 --> 01:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
like that
 
01:05:07.250 --> 01:05:07.260 align:start position:0%
and I think there may be approaches that
 
01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
we can take on the customer side or on
 
01:05:14.349 --> 01:05:14.359 align:start position:0%
the demand side that can also provide
 
01:05:17.349 --> 01:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
ability for us to
 
01:05:21.109 --> 01:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
keep the prices at check the ones that
 
01:05:22.069 --> 01:05:22.079 align:start position:0%
you face
 
01:05:26.450 --> 01:05:26.460 align:start position:0%
in the energy Supply rates so and that
 
01:05:29.049 --> 01:05:29.059 align:start position:0%
is a question are there things we can do
 
01:05:32.270 --> 01:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
so so I kind of point out few things
 
01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:33.170 align:start position:0%
so so I kind of point out few things
here

01:05:33.170 --> 01:05:33.180 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:05:35.329 --> 01:05:35.339 align:start position:0%
a better retail level rate making
 
01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
oriented like can we use tou it's it's
 
01:05:42.349 --> 01:05:42.359 align:start position:0%
it's been approved in some cases but
 
01:05:44.210 --> 01:05:44.220 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean it's end of the the
 
01:05:47.210 --> 01:05:47.220 align:start position:0%
job it's can we improve it then there's
 
01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
there's other items like Dynamic pricing
 
01:05:52.609 --> 01:05:52.619 align:start position:0%
real-time pricing so that
 
01:05:54.890 --> 01:05:54.900 align:start position:0%
um and that creates opportunities for
 
01:05:58.130 --> 01:05:58.140 align:start position:0%
transactive energy and and what I mean
 
01:06:01.789 --> 01:06:01.799 align:start position:0%
by that at a very high level you if you
 
01:06:04.130 --> 01:06:04.140 align:start position:0%
realize that electricity
 
01:06:06.589 --> 01:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
it's a unique product you have to match
 
01:06:10.430 --> 01:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
demand and Supply every instant and so
 
01:06:12.349 --> 01:06:12.359 align:start position:0%
in some ways you might say you have
 
01:06:16.490 --> 01:06:16.500 align:start position:0%
Market every instant being run
 
01:06:19.670 --> 01:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
um like so you want to meet and you're
 
01:06:21.950 --> 01:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
looking for a price signal that that
 
01:06:23.870 --> 01:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
tells you where the demand meets the
 
01:06:26.510 --> 01:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
supply because that's what basic
 
01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
economics will tell you it's you know
 
01:06:30.589 --> 01:06:30.599 align:start position:0%
it's it's the the laws of demand and
 
01:06:30.599 --> 01:06:31.789 align:start position:0%
it's it's the the laws of demand and
supply

01:06:31.789 --> 01:06:31.799 align:start position:0%
supply
 
01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm kind of uh and so it's
 
01:06:39.289 --> 01:06:39.299 align:start position:0%
and but we we have a system here we have
 
01:06:42.049 --> 01:06:42.059 align:start position:0%
average rate right a customer's rate is
 
01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
decided default service rate this is the
 
01:06:46.190 --> 01:06:46.200 align:start position:0%
rate for the next six months and that
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
creates actually opportunities for
 
01:06:51.710 --> 01:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
customers to be able to actually bring
 
01:06:54.410 --> 01:06:54.420 align:start position:0%
more value into the picture and maybe
 
01:06:58.430 --> 01:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
help lower the supply rates
 
01:07:03.349 --> 01:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
but it's it's it's it's a as I started
 
01:07:05.150 --> 01:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
saying it's a very general concept but
 
01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
I'm just sharing my thoughts as an
 
01:07:11.210 --> 01:07:11.220 align:start position:0%
economist okay great I wanted to let you
 
01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
finish your point before I pointed to
 
01:07:15.349 --> 01:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
representative Corman for a question
 
01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:07:21.109 --> 01:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
taking this question when you listed uh
 
01:07:23.270 --> 01:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
things that we can be done on the demand
 
01:07:25.370 --> 01:07:25.380 align:start position:0%
side one thing that you omitted was
 
01:07:27.829 --> 01:07:27.839 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency and I'm wondering uh
 
01:07:31.549 --> 01:07:31.559 align:start position:0%
why that wasn't in the list
 
01:07:35.930 --> 01:07:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:38.940 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency is also part of how
 
01:07:41.089 --> 01:07:41.099 align:start position:0%
you can
 
01:07:44.569 --> 01:07:44.579 align:start position:0%
reduce the demand so in that sense it is
 
01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:46.740 align:start position:0%
absolutely part of the demand it's in
 
01:07:49.069 --> 01:07:49.079 align:start position:0%
the in the in the picture already
 
01:07:52.430 --> 01:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
so I I I'm talking about are there other
 
01:07:55.730 --> 01:07:55.740 align:start position:0%
things that are more responsive to the
 
01:07:57.430 --> 01:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
market realities
 
01:07:59.210 --> 01:07:59.220 align:start position:0%
instantaneously that's what I was
 
01:08:01.849 --> 01:08:01.859 align:start position:0%
focusing on here a lot of the times
 
01:08:04.130 --> 01:08:04.140 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency is like almost like a
 
01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:07.260 align:start position:0%
base resource it's there you should
 
01:08:10.130 --> 01:08:10.140 align:start position:0%
definitely exploit it but here I was
 
01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
focusing on how better we can achieve
 
01:08:17.809 --> 01:08:17.819 align:start position:0%
the uh equilibrium between supply and
 
01:08:20.870 --> 01:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
demand and and so there may be things
 
01:08:24.709 --> 01:08:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:27.829 --> 01:08:27.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:31.130 --> 01:08:31.140 align:start position:0%
so I understand what you're saying
 
01:08:33.890 --> 01:08:33.900 align:start position:0%
um but can I infer then that that you
 
01:08:36.410 --> 01:08:36.420 align:start position:0%
feel like Energy Efficiency is as it's
 
01:08:38.689 --> 01:08:38.699 align:start position:0%
as far as we've gone and we really can't
 
01:08:41.809 --> 01:08:41.819 align:start position:0%
do anymore it's just there or or can can
 
01:08:44.150 --> 01:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
more be done on the demand side with
 
01:08:46.510 --> 01:08:46.520 align:start position:0%
regard to Energy Efficiency
 
01:08:49.970 --> 01:08:49.980 align:start position:0%
generally speaking there are
 
01:08:51.470 --> 01:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
um I mean first of all I have to be
 
01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
careful because there's this is an
 
01:08:55.189 --> 01:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
expiry thing and you know in the future
 
01:08:56.990 --> 01:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
sometime in July there will be another
 
01:08:59.630 --> 01:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
Docket in energy so I'll keep it really
 
01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:00.950 align:start position:0%
Docket in energy so I'll keep it really
General

01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
General
 
01:09:05.209 --> 01:09:05.219 align:start position:0%
we should always look for ways to
 
01:09:05.219 --> 01:09:07.729 align:start position:0%
we should always look for ways to
get

01:09:07.729 --> 01:09:07.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:07.739 --> 01:09:09.650 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:09:09.650 --> 01:09:09.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:12.229 --> 01:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
you know demand based resources into the
 
01:09:14.749 --> 01:09:14.759 align:start position:0%
mix as long as they are cost effective
 
01:09:18.829 --> 01:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
and we should always strive
 
01:09:23.930 --> 01:09:23.940 align:start position:0%
to even have Energy Efficiency that
 
01:09:26.349 --> 01:09:26.359 align:start position:0%
um that can be achieved
 
01:09:29.150 --> 01:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
to help us with the cost effective you
 
01:09:33.050 --> 01:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
know Solutions so I I would say nothing
 
01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:34.910 align:start position:0%
know Solutions so I I would say nothing
is

01:09:34.910 --> 01:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:09:38.749 --> 01:09:38.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
I'll add
 
01:09:42.169 --> 01:09:42.179 align:start position:0%
um I would agree there's a lot more that
 
01:09:43.849 --> 01:09:43.859 align:start position:0%
can be done in terms of Energy
 
01:09:46.249 --> 01:09:46.259 align:start position:0%
Efficiency and and demand responsiveness
 
01:09:48.890 --> 01:09:48.900 align:start position:0%
and what a commissioner chadapattai is
 
01:09:52.030 --> 01:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
uh discussing on this slide are the rate
 
01:09:55.130 --> 01:09:55.140 align:start position:0%
foundations on which customers are
 
01:09:57.890 --> 01:09:57.900 align:start position:0%
charged and today under the Paradigm
 
01:10:00.610 --> 01:10:00.620 align:start position:0%
where you have a fixed rate
 
01:10:03.770 --> 01:10:03.780 align:start position:0%
you there are opportunities to reduce
 
01:10:06.350 --> 01:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
that but in terms of Energy Efficiency
 
01:10:08.689 --> 01:10:08.699 align:start position:0%
there are things that people still need
 
01:10:11.689 --> 01:10:11.699 align:start position:0%
to do but they could change when they do
 
01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
it so for instance I am on a time of use
 
01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
rate my utility in Hampton offers time
 
01:10:19.330 --> 01:10:19.340 align:start position:0%
of use rates and I'm a customer on that
 
01:10:22.250 --> 01:10:22.260 align:start position:0%
my electricity price changes based on
 
01:10:24.590 --> 01:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
the hour of the day I change my behavior
 
01:10:27.290 --> 01:10:27.300 align:start position:0%
I charge my car at different times I
 
01:10:29.570 --> 01:10:29.580 align:start position:0%
turn on my dishwasher or my dryer at
 
01:10:31.850 --> 01:10:31.860 align:start position:0%
different times because of that
 
01:10:34.310 --> 01:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
I think what
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
we are presenting in terms of
 
01:10:39.709 --> 01:10:39.719 align:start position:0%
opportunities to Foster competition are
 
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
rate designs that enable customer
 
01:10:46.130 --> 01:10:46.140 align:start position:0%
control of demand responsiveness and
 
01:10:48.770 --> 01:10:48.780 align:start position:0%
that includes
 
01:10:51.050 --> 01:10:51.060 align:start position:0%
Baseline Energy Efficiency Technologies
 
01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
like we have today but there are many
 
01:10:56.810 --> 01:10:56.820 align:start position:0%
many other opportunities as well that we
 
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
could capture and provide customers with
 
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
more information so that they can change
 
01:11:08.570 --> 01:11:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:12.350 --> 01:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
I will I will add the the focus for me
 
01:11:16.490 --> 01:11:16.500 align:start position:0%
here is fostering competition and really
 
01:11:18.770 --> 01:11:18.780 align:start position:0%
what I'm I think uh commissioner Simpson
 
01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
explained it well that are there ways to
 
01:11:25.189 --> 01:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
um as a customer
 
01:11:29.090 --> 01:11:29.100 align:start position:0%
if I can bring in flexibility Into The
 
01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:30.290 align:start position:0%
if I can bring in flexibility Into The
Fray

01:11:30.290 --> 01:11:30.300 align:start position:0%
Fray
 
01:11:32.689 --> 01:11:32.699 align:start position:0%
that would lead to a better situation
 
01:11:35.810 --> 01:11:35.820 align:start position:0%
right now what tends to happen and
 
01:11:37.130 --> 01:11:37.140 align:start position:0%
that's what I was talking about my
 
01:11:39.410 --> 01:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
experience with the regional markets
 
01:11:42.229 --> 01:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
it it is kind of understandable but
 
01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
there's a focus mostly on the supply
 
01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:46.070 align:start position:0%
there's a focus mostly on the supply
side

01:11:46.070 --> 01:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
side
 
01:11:49.370 --> 01:11:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
that that's that's the point I'm trying
 
01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
to make
 
01:11:56.209 --> 01:11:56.219 align:start position:0%
could I uh just get your clarification
 
01:11:58.910 --> 01:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
on one point I think I heard you say
 
01:12:02.510 --> 01:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
that Community aggregation is a lot like
 
01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
a competitive supplier
 
01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
is that a valid way to make that
 
01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:09.550 align:start position:0%
is that a valid way to make that
comparison

01:12:09.550 --> 01:12:09.560 align:start position:0%
comparison
 
01:12:13.550 --> 01:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
I would say that I
 
01:12:15.890 --> 01:12:15.900 align:start position:0%
don't know the absolute answer for that
 
01:12:18.110 --> 01:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
question but what I was saying
 
01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:20.750 align:start position:0%
question but what I was saying
was

01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:12:24.169 --> 01:12:24.179 align:start position:0%
if just like a competitive supplier
 
01:12:27.649 --> 01:12:27.659 align:start position:0%
if you have a community aggregator and
 
01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
they give you different rates
 
01:12:31.250 --> 01:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
and they have a different way of
 
01:12:32.810 --> 01:12:32.820 align:start position:0%
managing resources
 
01:12:34.610 --> 01:12:34.620 align:start position:0%
that's providing
 
01:12:37.430 --> 01:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
competition there's another option out
 
01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:38.390 align:start position:0%
competition there's another option out
there

01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:12:41.570 --> 01:12:41.580 align:start position:0%
how I don't have the answer this is
 
01:12:44.030 --> 01:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
really a question whether that can be
 
01:12:47.689 --> 01:12:47.699 align:start position:0%
done in a way that is truly achieving
 
01:12:51.290 --> 01:12:51.300 align:start position:0%
that goal which is it puts more pressure
 
01:12:54.410 --> 01:12:54.420 align:start position:0%
downward pressure on the prices I it's
 
01:12:57.169 --> 01:12:57.179 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a question for everyone but
 
01:12:57.179 --> 01:12:58.490 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a question for everyone but
but

01:12:58.490 --> 01:12:58.500 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:13:03.169 --> 01:13:03.179 align:start position:0%
you need to always be in my opinion be
 
01:13:05.390 --> 01:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
more willing to
 
01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:06.709 align:start position:0%
more willing to
um

01:13:06.709 --> 01:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:09.470 --> 01:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
to allow for more options
 
01:13:12.430 --> 01:13:12.440 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
01:13:14.450 --> 01:13:14.460 align:start position:0%
representative partial now has a
 
01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:15.530 align:start position:0%
representative partial now has a
question

01:13:15.530 --> 01:13:15.540 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:13:17.930 --> 01:13:17.940 align:start position:0%
making sure those and thank you thank
 
01:13:19.550 --> 01:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
you again uh this question I'd like to
 
01:13:22.430 --> 01:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
ask uh Mr Simpson you were speaking
 
01:13:24.050 --> 01:13:24.060 align:start position:0%
about your and sounds like a very
 
01:13:26.030 --> 01:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
exciting system you have of being able
 
01:13:29.930 --> 01:13:29.940 align:start position:0%
to Monitor and uh plan your electric use
 
01:13:32.450 --> 01:13:32.460 align:start position:0%
in order to flatten the Curve uh you
 
01:13:36.250 --> 01:13:36.260 align:start position:0%
must live in a place other than the uh
 
01:13:38.570 --> 01:13:38.580 align:start position:0%
eversource where you have a meter that
 
01:13:40.729 --> 01:13:40.739 align:start position:0%
can do this I would imagine I live in
 
01:13:43.370 --> 01:13:43.380 align:start position:0%
the town of Hampton my utility is Unitil
 
01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
yes and majority of the our state does
 
01:13:49.189 --> 01:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
not have the capacity to enact that
 
01:13:51.770 --> 01:13:51.780 align:start position:0%
third bullet because we do not have the
 
01:13:53.870 --> 01:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
type of meter that allow us to do that
 
01:13:56.630 --> 01:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
so we have ongoing proceedings right now
 
01:13:58.850 --> 01:13:58.860 align:start position:0%
that pertain to this so I'm going to
 
01:14:02.689 --> 01:14:02.699 align:start position:0%
speak generally I can discuss my utility
 
01:14:05.390 --> 01:14:05.400 align:start position:0%
rate with Unitil because it's a we've
 
01:14:07.870 --> 01:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
issued an order it's an approved rate
 
01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
with respect to enabling time of use
 
01:14:13.189 --> 01:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
rates more broadly across the state
 
01:14:17.270 --> 01:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
that's been a policy Initiative for
 
01:14:18.669 --> 01:14:18.679 align:start position:0%
several years here in New Hampshire
 
01:14:22.370 --> 01:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
there's been uh the general court passed
 
01:14:25.130 --> 01:14:25.140 align:start position:0%
a law several years ago I think it was
 
01:14:26.290 --> 01:14:26.300 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
01:14:29.810 --> 01:14:29.820 align:start position:0%
517 that that started an investigation
 
01:14:31.970 --> 01:14:31.980 align:start position:0%
looking into time of use rates
 
01:14:35.810 --> 01:14:35.820 align:start position:0%
specifically for electric vehicles and
 
01:14:37.810 --> 01:14:37.820 align:start position:0%
uh I think
 
01:14:40.669 --> 01:14:40.679 align:start position:0%
understanding and and continuing to
 
01:14:44.090 --> 01:14:44.100 align:start position:0%
investigate uh broad deployment of that
 
01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh rate type for customers is is of
 
01:14:50.450 --> 01:14:50.460 align:start position:0%
interest for us and is something that
 
01:14:52.669 --> 01:14:52.679 align:start position:0%
we're we're looking at in multiple
 
01:14:55.790 --> 01:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
proceedings the underlying systems that
 
01:14:58.430 --> 01:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
you mentioned like metering uh that
 
01:15:01.490 --> 01:15:01.500 align:start position:0%
plays into it and
 
01:15:04.130 --> 01:15:04.140 align:start position:0%
um I think going back again to the the
 
01:15:06.590 --> 01:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
our discussion about
 
01:15:08.689 --> 01:15:08.699 align:start position:0%
you know the scale of investment these
 
01:15:10.669 --> 01:15:10.679 align:start position:0%
being very Capital intensive Industries
 
01:15:13.490 --> 01:15:13.500 align:start position:0%
the challenge that we face is that
 
01:15:17.689 --> 01:15:17.699 align:start position:0%
technology moves more quickly than uh
 
01:15:20.930 --> 01:15:20.940 align:start position:0%
the financial commitments that are
 
01:15:23.390 --> 01:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
required in this industry uh sometimes
 
01:15:27.250 --> 01:15:27.260 align:start position:0%
bare so the investment in a broad
 
01:15:29.570 --> 01:15:29.580 align:start position:0%
enterprise-wide system like that is
 
01:15:31.610 --> 01:15:31.620 align:start position:0%
hundreds of millions of dollars it has
 
01:15:33.350 --> 01:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
to be used for a certain period of time
 
01:15:35.930 --> 01:15:35.940 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying that I personally want to
 
01:15:38.630 --> 01:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
hold back on that I'm very interested in
 
01:15:41.390 --> 01:15:41.400 align:start position:0%
time of use rate designs personally
 
01:15:45.410 --> 01:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
um I I hope that we can enable more
 
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
options like that for customers uh so
 
01:15:51.290 --> 01:15:51.300 align:start position:0%
that they can take control of their
 
01:15:53.570 --> 01:15:53.580 align:start position:0%
energy use and the costs that they bear
 
01:15:58.490 --> 01:15:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:02.510 --> 01:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you before uh you move on I
 
01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
want to apologize to the three of you
 
01:16:07.130 --> 01:16:07.140 align:start position:0%
but I must leave I have to introduce a
 
01:16:09.050 --> 01:16:09.060 align:start position:0%
bill in another committee so
 
01:16:11.770 --> 01:16:11.780 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas will be uh
 
01:16:13.970 --> 01:16:13.980 align:start position:0%
presiding over the rest of this meeting
 
01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:15.110 align:start position:0%
presiding over the rest of this meeting
uh

01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:16:17.570 --> 01:16:17.580 align:start position:0%
and I thank you all three for being here
 
01:16:21.169 --> 01:16:21.179 align:start position:0%
giving us an excellent presentation and
 
01:16:22.850 --> 01:16:22.860 align:start position:0%
I regret that I'll miss the rest of it
 
01:16:25.610 --> 01:16:25.620 align:start position:0%
but uh thank you please continue
 
01:16:29.390 --> 01:16:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:34.130 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:16:34.130 --> 01:16:34.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:37.729 --> 01:16:37.739 align:start position:0%
by all means continue please so um going
 
01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:44.630 --> 01:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
slide 15.
 
01:16:47.030 --> 01:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
it is really tied to the point that I
 
01:16:50.930 --> 01:16:50.940 align:start position:0%
was making at the end in slide 14 and
 
01:16:53.870 --> 01:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
what I wanted to share from my end was
 
01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:55.790 align:start position:0%
what I wanted to share from my end was
that

01:16:55.790 --> 01:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:57.770 align:start position:0%
that
um

01:16:57.770 --> 01:16:57.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:00.229 --> 01:17:00.239 align:start position:0%
even as
 
01:17:02.590 --> 01:17:02.600 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire New Hampshire
 
01:17:05.709 --> 01:17:05.719 align:start position:0%
participating in the regional processes
 
01:17:09.229 --> 01:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
there may be opportunities to rely more
 
01:17:11.450 --> 01:17:11.460 align:start position:0%
on the demand side
 
01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
to bring value to customers here and the
 
01:17:18.070 --> 01:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
the point I'm trying to make here is
 
01:17:22.610 --> 01:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
that if you if you know how winter snaps
 
01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:23.570 align:start position:0%
that if you if you know how winter snaps
work

01:17:23.570 --> 01:17:23.580 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:17:25.850 --> 01:17:25.860 align:start position:0%
then there could be times when you have
 
01:17:29.330 --> 01:17:29.340 align:start position:0%
a pretty prolonged winter snap and that
 
01:17:32.810 --> 01:17:32.820 align:start position:0%
creates huge problems for the New
 
01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
England region because we are at the end
 
01:17:38.330 --> 01:17:38.340 align:start position:0%
of the the gas pipeline Network and so
 
01:17:41.149 --> 01:17:41.159 align:start position:0%
it creates problems we and
 
01:17:44.570 --> 01:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
we could really see a major issue
 
01:17:48.050 --> 01:17:48.060 align:start position:0%
because of that so what the intent of
 
01:17:50.030 --> 01:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
this slide is to say
 
01:17:52.610 --> 01:17:52.620 align:start position:0%
generally as a customer
 
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
you know if you're not paying a whole
 
01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
lot on electricity and I'm talking in
 
01:17:59.990 --> 01:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
terms of percentage of your income okay
 
01:18:02.689 --> 01:18:02.699 align:start position:0%
um you may say why do I worry about the
 
01:18:05.030 --> 01:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
fluctuating prices I am just paying
 
01:18:08.990 --> 01:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
three percent of my salary on it okay if
 
01:18:10.850 --> 01:18:10.860 align:start position:0%
it becomes four percent one year two
 
01:18:13.310 --> 01:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
percent the other year I I don't need to
 
01:18:15.290 --> 01:18:15.300 align:start position:0%
think so much I don't need to track how
 
01:18:18.050 --> 01:18:18.060 align:start position:0%
I'm consuming how I'm running the washer
 
01:18:19.850 --> 01:18:19.860 align:start position:0%
dryer and all of that I don't need to do
 
01:18:21.649 --> 01:18:21.659 align:start position:0%
that so I'm just going to be
 
01:18:24.590 --> 01:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
that may well be true a lot of customers
 
01:18:27.709 --> 01:18:27.719 align:start position:0%
may actually not need this kind of
 
01:18:31.130 --> 01:18:31.140 align:start position:0%
flexibility but I can definitely see
 
01:18:34.610 --> 01:18:34.620 align:start position:0%
that when you have a a prolonged winter
 
01:18:36.770 --> 01:18:36.780 align:start position:0%
snap kind of situation the prices go
 
01:18:36.780 --> 01:18:38.330 align:start position:0%
snap kind of situation the prices go
crazy

01:18:38.330 --> 01:18:38.340 align:start position:0%
crazy
 
01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
um you know even up to maybe even three
 
01:18:42.590 --> 01:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars like you know two
 
01:18:46.729 --> 01:18:46.739 align:start position:0%
thousand five hundred dollars so it's
 
01:18:49.070 --> 01:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
there is there is opportunities for
 
01:18:52.189 --> 01:18:52.199 align:start position:0%
customers to extract value out of that
 
01:18:55.729 --> 01:18:55.739 align:start position:0%
and do things even during winter and
 
01:18:57.890 --> 01:18:57.900 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm saying with this slide
 
01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
so we we need to also think about that
 
01:19:03.890 --> 01:19:03.900 align:start position:0%
that may be not happening right away but
 
01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:05.149 align:start position:0%
that may be not happening right away but
the

01:19:05.149 --> 01:19:05.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:19:08.209 --> 01:19:08.219 align:start position:0%
um the um
 
01:19:10.010 --> 01:19:10.020 align:start position:0%
urgency of it
 
01:19:13.070 --> 01:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
it's all dependent on our experience
 
01:19:15.770 --> 01:19:15.780 align:start position:0%
if a really bad cold snap hits then
 
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
we'll start thinking about it and
 
01:19:19.850 --> 01:19:19.860 align:start position:0%
usually what happens in again in the iso
 
01:19:21.770 --> 01:19:21.780 align:start position:0%
New England World the focus is more on
 
01:19:23.149 --> 01:19:23.159 align:start position:0%
the supply side
 
01:19:23.159 --> 01:19:30.890 align:start position:0%
the supply side
so

01:19:30.890 --> 01:19:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:33.169 --> 01:19:33.179 align:start position:0%
representative has a question and thank
 
01:19:36.290 --> 01:19:36.300 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair uh following following on
 
01:19:38.689 --> 01:19:38.699 align:start position:0%
your current discussion of customer
 
01:19:42.169 --> 01:19:42.179 align:start position:0%
choices uh I'm thinking of residential
 
01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
customers uh the price rate that we were
 
01:19:50.090 --> 01:19:50.100 align:start position:0%
stuck with or stuck on uh I think of as
 
01:19:52.729 --> 01:19:52.739 align:start position:0%
a signal to to the customers and they
 
01:19:55.790 --> 01:19:55.800 align:start position:0%
must be thinking of of changing their
 
01:19:59.030 --> 01:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
service to find a less costly Service uh
 
01:20:00.770 --> 01:20:00.780 align:start position:0%
do you track that information do you
 
01:20:02.689 --> 01:20:02.699 align:start position:0%
have access to that information and know
 
01:20:05.570 --> 01:20:05.580 align:start position:0%
how much of that is happening yeah uh
 
01:20:07.189 --> 01:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
yes we do track that information about
 
01:20:09.530 --> 01:20:09.540 align:start position:0%
15 percent of the customers in New
 
01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:10.390 align:start position:0%
15 percent of the customers in New
Hampshire

01:20:10.390 --> 01:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:20:14.090 --> 01:20:14.100 align:start position:0%
use a third-party supplier that is not
 
01:20:23.050 --> 01:20:23.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:26.990 --> 01:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
yes sir okay and and I assume that this
 
01:20:28.970 --> 01:20:28.980 align:start position:0%
is ongoing for some people it probably
 
01:20:30.830 --> 01:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
takes a little while to learn about this
 
01:20:33.470 --> 01:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
and get themselves set up to chase it
 
01:20:35.870 --> 01:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
out yeah I think a lot of people are
 
01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
surprised that uh the that rate is not
 
01:20:41.149 --> 01:20:41.159 align:start position:0%
the uh that the number of the default
 
01:20:41.159 --> 01:20:42.290 align:start position:0%
the uh that the number of the default
service

01:20:42.290 --> 01:20:42.300 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:20:43.910 --> 01:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
um number of customers taking default
 
01:20:45.649 --> 01:20:45.659 align:start position:0%
services so High
 
01:20:48.050 --> 01:20:48.060 align:start position:0%
um that the transition hasn't been uh
 
01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:49.370 align:start position:0%
um that the transition hasn't been uh
faster

01:20:49.370 --> 01:20:49.380 align:start position:0%
faster
 
01:20:51.350 --> 01:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
um in other states it's been faster I
 
01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
think a lot of people in New Hampshire
 
01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
blame it on the original rollout which
 
01:20:57.950 --> 01:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
was before any of our time but there the
 
01:20:59.510 --> 01:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
rollout maybe wasn't as smooth as it
 
01:21:01.910 --> 01:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
could have been so uh it is surprising
 
01:21:03.110 --> 01:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
and now we have the community
 
01:21:05.990 --> 01:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
aggregation thing rolling in and will
 
01:21:08.330 --> 01:21:08.340 align:start position:0%
that you know start to start to dominate
 
01:21:10.490 --> 01:21:10.500 align:start position:0%
default service is is a good question
 
01:21:12.590 --> 01:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
it's early days so we don't we don't
 
01:21:17.890 --> 01:21:17.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh I have a question a follow-up to uh
 
01:21:24.410 --> 01:21:24.420 align:start position:0%
representative Knowles question so
 
01:21:26.750 --> 01:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
um could it be that
 
01:21:29.570 --> 01:21:29.580 align:start position:0%
as far as I'm aware if you were to
 
01:21:31.790 --> 01:21:31.800 align:start position:0%
change your entry supplier
 
01:21:36.050 --> 01:21:36.060 align:start position:0%
uh to a lower rate the
 
01:21:36.060 --> 01:21:37.850 align:start position:0%
uh to a lower rate the
the

01:21:37.850 --> 01:21:37.860 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
impetus is on the customer to make sure
 
01:21:46.130 --> 01:21:46.140 align:start position:0%
that he watches that when the next
 
01:21:46.140 --> 01:21:46.850 align:start position:0%
that he watches that when the next
um

01:21:46.850 --> 01:21:46.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
time period comes like after six months
 
01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
or whatever it is uh they may forget
 
01:21:55.370 --> 01:21:55.380 align:start position:0%
they it's it's a it it's upon them to
 
01:21:58.010 --> 01:21:58.020 align:start position:0%
say oh I don't want you anymore because
 
01:21:59.990 --> 01:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
your rates can be higher than the other
 
01:22:02.630 --> 01:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
rate I was on before I left now I have
 
01:22:04.910 --> 01:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
to switch again is there a way that we
 
01:22:08.770 --> 01:22:08.780 align:start position:0%
could smooth it out so uh customers
 
01:22:11.149 --> 01:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
don't have to remember to do that so
 
01:22:14.330 --> 01:22:14.340 align:start position:0%
much I guess is my question
 
01:22:17.810 --> 01:22:17.820 align:start position:0%
okay I think that's a very fair concern
 
01:22:19.970 --> 01:22:19.980 align:start position:0%
um I've personally used third-party
 
01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:21.729 align:start position:0%
um I've personally used third-party
suppliers

01:22:21.729 --> 01:22:21.739 align:start position:0%
suppliers
 
01:22:24.169 --> 01:22:24.179 align:start position:0%
in the past and and there is no
 
01:22:26.630 --> 01:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
notification there's uh we you know we
 
01:22:28.010 --> 01:22:28.020 align:start position:0%
have the big calendar at home and we
 
01:22:30.410 --> 01:22:30.420 align:start position:0%
write the date on when it when it when
 
01:22:32.149 --> 01:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
it's coming due and that's maybe not the
 
01:22:34.850 --> 01:22:34.860 align:start position:0%
best way to to run a railroad no pun
 
01:22:34.860 --> 01:22:36.169 align:start position:0%
best way to to run a railroad no pun
intended

01:22:36.169 --> 01:22:36.179 align:start position:0%
intended
 
01:22:39.649 --> 01:22:39.659 align:start position:0%
um so so that that is something that uh
 
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
that is problematic in terms of this
 
01:22:43.490 --> 01:22:43.500 align:start position:0%
notification process as it exists today
 
01:22:45.530 --> 01:22:45.540 align:start position:0%
from the third parties
 
01:22:48.410 --> 01:22:48.420 align:start position:0%
the if I may ask a follow-up do you see
 
01:22:56.570 --> 01:22:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:59.090 --> 01:22:59.100 align:start position:0%
I would let commissioner
 
01:23:01.729 --> 01:23:01.739 align:start position:0%
so I would I would leave that question
 
01:23:04.370 --> 01:23:04.380 align:start position:0%
to the legislature frankly
 
01:23:06.649 --> 01:23:06.659 align:start position:0%
um I think that there are factors to
 
01:23:08.870 --> 01:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
consider when you weigh whether or not
 
01:23:11.270 --> 01:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
you impose changes like that I mean
 
01:23:15.830 --> 01:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
clearly that or I should say changes in
 
01:23:20.870 --> 01:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
terms of program structure or rules have
 
01:23:22.850 --> 01:23:22.860 align:start position:0%
an impact in how the competitive
 
01:23:25.970 --> 01:23:25.980 align:start position:0%
supplier Community then weighs the risks
 
01:23:28.550 --> 01:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
that they factor into their price
 
01:23:30.290 --> 01:23:30.300 align:start position:0%
and what they ultimately charge
 
01:23:33.169 --> 01:23:33.179 align:start position:0%
customers so I think that's a policy
 
01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
decision that would be best answered by
 
01:23:37.550 --> 01:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
the legislature but I would I would say
 
01:23:40.130 --> 01:23:40.140 align:start position:0%
that there are many considerations on
 
01:23:42.050 --> 01:23:42.060 align:start position:0%
how those changes might impact
 
01:23:47.810 --> 01:23:47.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:49.270 --> 01:23:49.280 align:start position:0%
I want to
 
01:23:51.350 --> 01:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
respond to
 
01:23:54.050 --> 01:23:54.060 align:start position:0%
what commissioner Gunner was talking
 
01:23:57.169 --> 01:23:57.179 align:start position:0%
about you know he's he's he has
 
01:24:00.290 --> 01:24:00.300 align:start position:0%
competitive supplies you know I I can
 
01:24:03.470 --> 01:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
tell you just day before yesterday I was
 
01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:24:07.130 --> 01:24:07.140 align:start position:0%
yeah we can we have options and I told
 
01:24:10.430 --> 01:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
that to my wife so you're telling me now
 
01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
he's like so she had no clue but I that
 
01:24:16.970 --> 01:24:16.980 align:start position:0%
also tells me that she doesn't listen to
 
01:24:20.810 --> 01:24:20.820 align:start position:0%
me because I probably did did tell her a
 
01:24:22.250 --> 01:24:22.260 align:start position:0%
long time ago
 
01:24:25.610 --> 01:24:25.620 align:start position:0%
um so I know friends who are very
 
01:24:27.770 --> 01:24:27.780 align:start position:0%
particular they're actually looking at
 
01:24:29.450 --> 01:24:29.460 align:start position:0%
the rates all the time they are on
 
01:24:31.790 --> 01:24:31.800 align:start position:0%
competitive Supply they're they it's
 
01:24:33.950 --> 01:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
also a question of how long you want to
 
01:24:35.330 --> 01:24:35.340 align:start position:0%
be locked in
 
01:24:38.270 --> 01:24:38.280 align:start position:0%
okay so they think about that aspect too
 
01:24:40.729 --> 01:24:40.739 align:start position:0%
so you might you might as the prices are
 
01:24:43.850 --> 01:24:43.860 align:start position:0%
beginning to go down let's say then you
 
01:24:45.530 --> 01:24:45.540 align:start position:0%
might say you know what
 
01:24:49.250 --> 01:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
um if I if I uh jump into a log price
 
01:24:51.950 --> 01:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
for the next for one year that may not
 
01:24:54.229 --> 01:24:54.239 align:start position:0%
be smart because what might happen is
 
01:24:55.910 --> 01:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
the prices go down
 
01:24:59.030 --> 01:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
so much that the average rate that that
 
01:25:01.550 --> 01:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
the competitive supplier is giving me
 
01:25:04.970 --> 01:25:04.980 align:start position:0%
that may be high so let me just I I know
 
01:25:06.649 --> 01:25:06.659 align:start position:0%
that I had those discussions with mine
 
01:25:09.590 --> 01:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to share that okay
 
01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:10.910 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to share that okay
um

01:25:10.910 --> 01:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:13.070 --> 01:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
I think that's that's it please keep
 
01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:17.750 align:start position:0%
I think that's that's it please keep
sharing

01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:20.090 --> 01:25:20.100 align:start position:0%
representative once has a question thank
 
01:25:21.649 --> 01:25:21.659 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
01:25:21.659 --> 01:25:22.810 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
um

01:25:22.810 --> 01:25:22.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:25.370 --> 01:25:25.380 align:start position:0%
which which government agency has
 
01:25:27.229 --> 01:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
oversight responsibility for the third
 
01:25:36.950 --> 01:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:40.490 --> 01:25:40.500 align:start position:0%
so the department of energy tracks those
 
01:25:42.169 --> 01:25:42.179 align:start position:0%
prices if you go to the New Hampshire
 
01:25:44.689 --> 01:25:44.699 align:start position:0%
Department of Energy's website you can
 
01:25:48.110 --> 01:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
see all of the competitive or I believe
 
01:25:50.870 --> 01:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
all of you can see competitive Supply
 
01:25:54.590 --> 01:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
rates that are offered in New Hampshire
 
01:25:57.709 --> 01:25:57.719 align:start position:0%
um and they have the responsibility for
 
01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:01.199 align:start position:0%
for uh providing that information to the
 
01:26:03.530 --> 01:26:03.540 align:start position:0%
public and reviewing it
 
01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:04.850 align:start position:0%
public and reviewing it
follow-up

01:26:04.850 --> 01:26:04.860 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:26:06.530 --> 01:26:06.540 align:start position:0%
follow-up do they also have
 
01:26:08.750 --> 01:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility for
 
01:26:11.390 --> 01:26:11.400 align:start position:0%
um addressing customer service issues
 
01:26:14.629 --> 01:26:14.639 align:start position:0%
such as not notifying people in a timely
 
01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
manner when rates are changing
 
01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:18.550 align:start position:0%
manner when rates are changing
um

01:26:18.550 --> 01:26:18.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:21.950 --> 01:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
there they have a consumer division that
 
01:26:24.530 --> 01:26:24.540 align:start position:0%
works with customers I don't know if
 
01:26:24.540 --> 01:26:25.729 align:start position:0%
works with customers I don't know if
they

01:26:25.729 --> 01:26:25.739 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if they're if that's
 
01:26:29.930 --> 01:26:29.940 align:start position:0%
something that is an initiative of
 
01:26:31.490 --> 01:26:31.500 align:start position:0%
theirs or not
 
01:26:35.450 --> 01:26:35.460 align:start position:0%
um but we as the adjudicative body for
 
01:26:38.090 --> 01:26:38.100 align:start position:0%
really primarily utility rates we don't
 
01:26:40.370 --> 01:26:40.380 align:start position:0%
interface in that way that's now been
 
01:26:43.790 --> 01:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:46.910 --> 01:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
uh I see we have not much time left I'd
 
01:26:48.470 --> 01:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
like to have you continue so you can
 
01:26:51.229 --> 01:26:51.239 align:start position:0%
cover your material uh before we ask too
 
01:26:55.010 --> 01:26:55.020 align:start position:0%
many more barrages of questions
 
01:26:57.770 --> 01:26:57.780 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm up next
 
01:26:57.780 --> 01:27:00.110 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm up next
um

01:27:00.110 --> 01:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:02.629 --> 01:27:02.639 align:start position:0%
we wanted to address the topic of
 
01:27:04.490 --> 01:27:04.500 align:start position:0%
protection of consumers so I have a
 
01:27:06.530 --> 01:27:06.540 align:start position:0%
slide on that where I'll discuss our
 
01:27:08.270 --> 01:27:08.280 align:start position:0%
various authorities but then the
 
01:27:09.950 --> 01:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
remainder of my presentation is really
 
01:27:12.590 --> 01:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
just to try to be educational and
 
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
provide context I think we've had a lot
 
01:27:16.550 --> 01:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
of the discussions this morning but I've
 
01:27:18.410 --> 01:27:18.420 align:start position:0%
tried to structure it in a way that
 
01:27:22.189 --> 01:27:22.199 align:start position:0%
helps explain utility history utility
 
01:27:24.649 --> 01:27:24.659 align:start position:0%
regulation generally speaking some of
 
01:27:27.169 --> 01:27:27.179 align:start position:0%
the precedent that we rely on as utility
 
01:27:29.330 --> 01:27:29.340 align:start position:0%
regulators and then the New England
 
01:27:31.189 --> 01:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
Market at Large
 
01:27:33.110 --> 01:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
so with respect to protection of
 
01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:35.689 align:start position:0%
so with respect to protection of
consumers

01:27:35.689 --> 01:27:35.699 align:start position:0%
consumers
 
01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
we generally regulate the utilities in
 
01:27:42.470 --> 01:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
in the state and our goal is to ensure
 
01:27:45.290 --> 01:27:45.300 align:start position:0%
that they do not charge illegal unjust
 
01:27:49.070 --> 01:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
unreasonable or discriminatory rates the
 
01:27:51.470 --> 01:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
utilities are answerable to us to
 
01:27:54.050 --> 01:27:54.060 align:start position:0%
provide for safe and adequate service
 
01:27:56.450 --> 01:27:56.460 align:start position:0%
the department of energy and the office
 
01:27:59.410 --> 01:27:59.420 align:start position:0%
of the consumer Advocate also are
 
01:28:02.390 --> 01:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
authorities in this space for protecting
 
01:28:03.490 --> 01:28:03.500 align:start position:0%
the public
 
01:28:06.110 --> 01:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
if a complaint is filed against a
 
01:28:08.890 --> 01:28:08.900 align:start position:0%
utility at the department of energy
 
01:28:12.530 --> 01:28:12.540 align:start position:0%
and there's no resolution to that then
 
01:28:15.110 --> 01:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
the complaint can be submitted to the
 
01:28:18.169 --> 01:28:18.179 align:start position:0%
puc and we can hear that complaint and
 
01:28:20.570 --> 01:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
come to a decision
 
01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
um we are authorized on our own
 
01:28:24.890 --> 01:28:24.900 align:start position:0%
initiative to investigate and inspect
 
01:28:28.010 --> 01:28:28.020 align:start position:0%
utilities and initiate proceedings if we
 
01:28:30.530 --> 01:28:30.540 align:start position:0%
feel that there are risks out there or
 
01:28:33.050 --> 01:28:33.060 align:start position:0%
that there are issues that deserve uh
 
01:28:36.530 --> 01:28:36.540 align:start position:0%
our uh oversight and furthermore the
 
01:28:38.570 --> 01:28:38.580 align:start position:0%
utility can come before us on their own
 
01:28:40.750 --> 01:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
initiative as well
 
01:28:43.010 --> 01:28:43.020 align:start position:0%
we can request that the Attorney
 
01:28:45.530 --> 01:28:45.540 align:start position:0%
General's office initiate a legal
 
01:28:47.870 --> 01:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
proceeding for a utilities failure to
 
01:28:49.250 --> 01:28:49.260 align:start position:0%
perform duties
 
01:28:51.410 --> 01:28:51.420 align:start position:0%
and the commission can order reparations
 
01:28:57.649 --> 01:28:57.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:00.590 --> 01:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
uh is it possible to hold a question
 
01:29:02.450 --> 01:29:02.460 align:start position:0%
until they get going a little more
 
01:29:04.129 --> 01:29:04.139 align:start position:0%
further so they can get the material or
 
01:29:06.169 --> 01:29:06.179 align:start position:0%
is it something it's can can you write
 
01:29:08.450 --> 01:29:08.460 align:start position:0%
it down and ask you what and ask later
 
01:29:09.950 --> 01:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:11.810 align:start position:0%
thank you
so

01:29:11.810 --> 01:29:11.820 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:29:13.250 --> 01:29:13.260 align:start position:0%
um I mentioned this earlier but
 
01:29:15.830 --> 01:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
generally speaking utility regulation
 
01:29:18.770 --> 01:29:18.780 align:start position:0%
arose in the 19th century
 
01:29:20.990 --> 01:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
um around the provision of water service
 
01:29:23.930 --> 01:29:23.940 align:start position:0%
initially and then that uh gas service
 
01:29:26.330 --> 01:29:26.340 align:start position:0%
for gas lighting
 
01:29:28.610 --> 01:29:28.620 align:start position:0%
um this came this concept of the natural
 
01:29:31.970 --> 01:29:31.980 align:start position:0%
monopoly is critical uh John Stuart Mill
 
01:29:35.510 --> 01:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
in 1848 utility service could be
 
01:29:38.090 --> 01:29:38.100 align:start position:0%
supplied at a lower cost if the
 
01:29:40.850 --> 01:29:40.860 align:start position:0%
duplication of facilities by competitive
 
01:29:42.770 --> 01:29:42.780 align:start position:0%
firms were avoided
 
01:29:44.570 --> 01:29:44.580 align:start position:0%
um there's a there's a picture that many
 
01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
people have seen of early electric polls
 
01:29:50.209 --> 01:29:50.219 align:start position:0%
with dozens of electric wires hanging on
 
01:29:53.810 --> 01:29:53.820 align:start position:0%
them that is not an efficient model for
 
01:29:56.510 --> 01:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
the provision of an incredibly Capital
 
01:29:59.810 --> 01:29:59.820 align:start position:0%
intensive uh business that is essential
 
01:30:03.770 --> 01:30:03.780 align:start position:0%
to the public so we enable utilities to
 
01:30:06.470 --> 01:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
have a monopoly because fundamentally it
 
01:30:09.290 --> 01:30:09.300 align:start position:0%
is more cost effective to have one
 
01:30:11.870 --> 01:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
provider of these Services than multiple
 
01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:14.330 align:start position:0%
provider of these Services than multiple
providers

01:30:14.330 --> 01:30:14.340 align:start position:0%
providers
 
01:30:16.070 --> 01:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
um we
 
01:30:18.770 --> 01:30:18.780 align:start position:0%
have regulation in order to protect the
 
01:30:21.550 --> 01:30:21.560 align:start position:0%
public interest from that Monopoly power
 
01:30:24.290 --> 01:30:24.300 align:start position:0%
the utilities have to offer Universal
 
01:30:26.270 --> 01:30:26.280 align:start position:0%
service they have to offer service to
 
01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
everyone they have to do it safely they
 
01:30:31.490 --> 01:30:31.500 align:start position:0%
have to do it reliably and they have to
 
01:30:34.250 --> 01:30:34.260 align:start position:0%
do it responsibly because customers
 
01:30:35.930 --> 01:30:35.940 align:start position:0%
can't shop around from their incumbent
 
01:30:38.810 --> 01:30:38.820 align:start position:0%
provider they only have one
 
01:30:41.810 --> 01:30:41.820 align:start position:0%
going to our next Slide the regulatory
 
01:30:45.950 --> 01:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
compact is a concept in the field of
 
01:30:49.070 --> 01:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
utility regulation and what it means is
 
01:30:51.350 --> 01:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
that there's an agreement that exists
 
01:30:54.530 --> 01:30:54.540 align:start position:0%
between a utility that's a private
 
01:30:56.570 --> 01:30:56.580 align:start position:0%
company and the government
 
01:30:59.090 --> 01:30:59.100 align:start position:0%
we've given them a monopoly they're the
 
01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:01.199 align:start position:0%
only one that can provide service in a
 
01:31:03.770 --> 01:31:03.780 align:start position:0%
geographic area the utility therefore
 
01:31:06.530 --> 01:31:06.540 align:start position:0%
has an obligation to serve all customers
 
01:31:08.450 --> 01:31:08.460 align:start position:0%
within those bounds
 
01:31:11.450 --> 01:31:11.460 align:start position:0%
the government in turn promises to set
 
01:31:14.390 --> 01:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
rates that the utility can charge in a
 
01:31:16.310 --> 01:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
manner that will compensate the utility
 
01:31:18.530 --> 01:31:18.540 align:start position:0%
for the costs that they've incurred to
 
01:31:20.689 --> 01:31:20.699 align:start position:0%
provide that service and the case
 
01:31:23.090 --> 01:31:23.100 align:start position:0%
precedent is we often refer to the Blue
 
01:31:25.610 --> 01:31:25.620 align:start position:0%
Field case that the utility is entitled
 
01:31:27.590 --> 01:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
to rates that permit it to earn a return
 
01:31:30.050 --> 01:31:30.060 align:start position:0%
on its property it can recover its cost
 
01:31:32.629 --> 01:31:32.639 align:start position:0%
and on the property that it that it
 
01:31:34.070 --> 01:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
develops the infrastructure that
 
01:31:36.169 --> 01:31:36.179 align:start position:0%
develops it's entitled to earn a return
 
01:31:38.090 --> 01:31:38.100 align:start position:0%
on that for the provision of that
 
01:31:42.050 --> 01:31:42.060 align:start position:0%
service that's incentive regulation that
 
01:31:42.060 --> 01:31:43.270 align:start position:0%
service that's incentive regulation that
we've

01:31:43.270 --> 01:31:43.280 align:start position:0%
we've
 
01:31:45.830 --> 01:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
incentivized utility Behavior we've told
 
01:31:48.709 --> 01:31:48.719 align:start position:0%
them you have this Monopoly you you can
 
01:31:49.850 --> 01:31:49.860 align:start position:0%
operate you're the only one that can
 
01:31:51.709 --> 01:31:51.719 align:start position:0%
operate in this area you have the
 
01:31:54.530 --> 01:31:54.540 align:start position:0%
opportunity to earn a return on that
 
01:31:56.990 --> 01:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
that incentive regulation Paradigm
 
01:31:59.470 --> 01:31:59.480 align:start position:0%
limits some utility decision making
 
01:32:02.750 --> 01:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
utilities are fundamentally risk adverse
 
01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
because of that that construct but it
 
01:32:06.950 --> 01:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
also can incentivize other utility
 
01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:09.169 align:start position:0%
also can incentivize other utility
Behavior

01:32:09.169 --> 01:32:09.179 align:start position:0%
Behavior
 
01:32:12.050 --> 01:32:12.060 align:start position:0%
um and Under The Hope case just in
 
01:32:14.090 --> 01:32:14.100 align:start position:0%
reasonable rates involve the balancing
 
01:32:16.910 --> 01:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
of investor and consumer interests so
 
01:32:19.129 --> 01:32:19.139 align:start position:0%
again going back to that concept that
 
01:32:22.070 --> 01:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
Capital intensive very expensive
 
01:32:24.290 --> 01:32:24.300 align:start position:0%
utilities have to borrow money raise
 
01:32:26.689 --> 01:32:26.699 align:start position:0%
Capital that the balance of that
 
01:32:29.090 --> 01:32:29.100 align:start position:0%
incentive regulation is to enable them
 
01:32:33.110 --> 01:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
to access Capital at competitive rates
 
01:32:35.149 --> 01:32:35.159 align:start position:0%
can we get through this presentation a
 
01:32:36.649 --> 01:32:36.659 align:start position:0%
little bit more and then we can write
 
01:32:38.450 --> 01:32:38.460 align:start position:0%
your question down we will allow
 
01:32:40.129 --> 01:32:40.139 align:start position:0%
questions later
 
01:32:43.610 --> 01:32:43.620 align:start position:0%
thanks until you're done with your part
 
01:32:45.350 --> 01:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
of the presentation okay I'll try to
 
01:32:47.930 --> 01:32:47.940 align:start position:0%
move as quickly as I can
 
01:32:50.870 --> 01:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
um the next slide slide 20 uh just
 
01:32:53.689 --> 01:32:53.699 align:start position:0%
demonstrates the elements of the
 
01:32:56.510 --> 01:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
electric grid and uh
 
01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
I I present this it's an often shown uh
 
01:33:03.470 --> 01:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
graphic to show really the the utility
 
01:33:05.689 --> 01:33:05.699 align:start position:0%
structure but also fundamentally
 
01:33:08.209 --> 01:33:08.219 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction in the jurisdictional
 
01:33:10.669 --> 01:33:10.679 align:start position:0%
questions and relevance that exists
 
01:33:12.110 --> 01:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
between the states and the federal
 
01:33:16.010 --> 01:33:16.020 align:start position:0%
government so on this graphic you see uh
 
01:33:18.169 --> 01:33:18.179 align:start position:0%
a generation facility on the left a
 
01:33:19.790 --> 01:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
power plant
 
01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
um that then connects to the
 
01:33:25.189 --> 01:33:25.199 align:start position:0%
transmission system which is Interstate
 
01:33:28.490 --> 01:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
generally speaking and that provides
 
01:33:31.370 --> 01:33:31.380 align:start position:0%
bulk transmission of energy across state
 
01:33:35.470 --> 01:33:35.480 align:start position:0%
lines those lines then end within States
 
01:33:38.629 --> 01:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
and they uh connect to the local
 
01:33:41.450 --> 01:33:41.460 align:start position:0%
Distribution Systems which are primarily
 
01:33:43.550 --> 01:33:43.560 align:start position:0%
uh state which are State and are
 
01:33:48.590 --> 01:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:51.050 --> 01:33:51.060 align:start position:0%
um going to our next slide just to give
 
01:33:53.030 --> 01:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
you some insight into you know where
 
01:33:55.850 --> 01:33:55.860 align:start position:0%
does this Authority come from why why do
 
01:33:58.189 --> 01:33:58.199 align:start position:0%
states regulate distribution why does
 
01:34:00.530 --> 01:34:00.540 align:start position:0%
the ferc regulate transmission
 
01:34:03.110 --> 01:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
so the state regulation is rooted in the
 
01:34:05.510 --> 01:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
U.S Constitution under our police power
 
01:34:07.970 --> 01:34:07.980 align:start position:0%
and that's the ability for states to
 
01:34:10.310 --> 01:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
regulate for the societal benefit of
 
01:34:13.010 --> 01:34:13.020 align:start position:0%
health safety and general welfare and it
 
01:34:14.810 --> 01:34:14.820 align:start position:0%
isn't specific to utilities that's a
 
01:34:16.850 --> 01:34:16.860 align:start position:0%
broad Authority that states have under
 
01:34:19.610 --> 01:34:19.620 align:start position:0%
the United States Constitution
 
01:34:22.129 --> 01:34:22.139 align:start position:0%
um under the 10th Amendment Powers not
 
01:34:24.169 --> 01:34:24.179 align:start position:0%
delegated to the federal government are
 
01:34:26.090 --> 01:34:26.100 align:start position:0%
reserved for the states so that's
 
01:34:28.310 --> 01:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
expansive that if the federal government
 
01:34:31.129 --> 01:34:31.139 align:start position:0%
has not said we are going to regulate
 
01:34:33.709 --> 01:34:33.719 align:start position:0%
this area of business that is left to
 
01:34:36.110 --> 01:34:36.120 align:start position:0%
the states to regulate and state
 
01:34:38.750 --> 01:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
regulation as I noted generally focuses
 
01:34:41.390 --> 01:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
on local distribution of energy the
 
01:34:44.510 --> 01:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
generation of of energy and intrastate
 
01:34:46.970 --> 01:34:46.980 align:start position:0%
activities activities that occur within
 
01:34:52.010 --> 01:34:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:54.110 --> 01:34:54.120 align:start position:0%
going to the next slide
 
01:34:56.930 --> 01:34:56.940 align:start position:0%
um the federal government's regulatory
 
01:35:00.410 --> 01:35:00.420 align:start position:0%
Authority in this space uh comes out of
 
01:35:02.209 --> 01:35:02.219 align:start position:0%
the the Commerce Clause in the United
 
01:35:04.490 --> 01:35:04.500 align:start position:0%
States Constitution that the Congress
 
01:35:06.530 --> 01:35:06.540 align:start position:0%
shall have the power to regulate
 
01:35:09.590 --> 01:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
commerce among several States
 
01:35:11.510 --> 01:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
um so when there's something that
 
01:35:14.350 --> 01:35:14.360 align:start position:0%
crosses state borders that is now
 
01:35:16.970 --> 01:35:16.980 align:start position:0%
overseen by the federal government and
 
01:35:19.910 --> 01:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
not state governments and the relevant
 
01:35:21.950 --> 01:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
federal statute is the federal power act
 
01:35:24.290 --> 01:35:24.300 align:start position:0%
and that provides that ferc has
 
01:35:27.350 --> 01:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over the use or sale of
 
01:35:30.370 --> 01:35:30.380 align:start position:0%
electric energy in interstate commerce
 
01:35:33.050 --> 01:35:33.060 align:start position:0%
applying to the transmission of electric
 
01:35:36.590 --> 01:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
energy in inter-state Commerce and to
 
01:35:39.410 --> 01:35:39.420 align:start position:0%
the sale of electric energy at wholesale
 
01:35:41.930 --> 01:35:41.940 align:start position:0%
in interstate commerce so there's a
 
01:35:44.390 --> 01:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
natural gas act but I think the it's
 
01:35:46.669 --> 01:35:46.679 align:start position:0%
well stated in the federal power act and
 
01:35:49.610 --> 01:35:49.620 align:start position:0%
that theme applies generally
 
01:35:51.890 --> 01:35:51.900 align:start position:0%
any other sale
 
01:35:54.350 --> 01:35:54.360 align:start position:0%
meaning distribution of retail electric
 
01:35:56.149 --> 01:35:56.159 align:start position:0%
energy is regulated by the states
 
01:35:58.490 --> 01:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
regulated by this commission which was
 
01:36:01.010 --> 01:36:01.020 align:start position:0%
created by the legislature
 
01:36:03.890 --> 01:36:03.900 align:start position:0%
um and other regulatory authorities all
 
01:36:05.390 --> 01:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
rates in connection with the
 
01:36:07.430 --> 01:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
transmission or sale of electric energy
 
01:36:10.070 --> 01:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
subject to the jurisdiction of the
 
01:36:11.870 --> 01:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
 
01:36:14.390 --> 01:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
shall be just unreasonable same as us
 
01:36:17.689 --> 01:36:17.699 align:start position:0%
rates that we set and regulate must be
 
01:36:19.550 --> 01:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
just and reasonable as well
 
01:36:22.010 --> 01:36:22.020 align:start position:0%
I think it's a good time to pause and I
 
01:36:23.629 --> 01:36:23.639 align:start position:0%
like to get back to some good questions
 
01:36:26.930 --> 01:36:26.940 align:start position:0%
uh sure I representative Carmen if you
 
01:36:28.370 --> 01:36:28.380 align:start position:0%
had your course no four and I believe
 
01:36:31.430 --> 01:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
representative Summers had a question at
 
01:36:33.649 --> 01:36:33.659 align:start position:0%
the time so let's cover those questions
 
01:36:35.750 --> 01:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
or any questions that that might come up
 
01:36:38.209 --> 01:36:38.219 align:start position:0%
on these last two pages that were quite
 
01:36:40.669 --> 01:36:40.679 align:start position:0%
interesting but as a matter of fact
 
01:36:43.490 --> 01:36:43.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh so I'm just
 
01:36:45.610 --> 01:36:45.620 align:start position:0%
going back to uh when you talk about
 
01:36:48.169 --> 01:36:48.179 align:start position:0%
investigations and I'm just curious
 
01:36:51.530 --> 01:36:51.540 align:start position:0%
um when when does the puc decide to open
 
01:36:55.430 --> 01:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
a docket what are the uh criteria
 
01:36:57.110 --> 01:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
um what are the limits to what you can
 
01:37:00.530 --> 01:37:00.540 align:start position:0%
do uh things like that
 
01:37:03.890 --> 01:37:03.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:07.490 --> 01:37:07.500 align:start position:0%
we have um maybe one of my colleagues
 
01:37:09.229 --> 01:37:09.239 align:start position:0%
might have the statutory reference the
 
01:37:12.110 --> 01:37:12.120 align:start position:0%
RSA but there's an RSA that enables the
 
01:37:16.729 --> 01:37:16.739 align:start position:0%
commission to open an investigation and
 
01:37:20.450 --> 01:37:20.460 align:start position:0%
um it's it's General Authority
 
01:37:22.850 --> 01:37:22.860 align:start position:0%
um perhaps one of my colleagues might
 
01:37:25.490 --> 01:37:25.500 align:start position:0%
have the you know have the text
 
01:37:25.500 --> 01:37:27.470 align:start position:0%
have the you know have the text
um

01:37:27.470 --> 01:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:29.090 align:start position:0%
um
we

01:37:29.090 --> 01:37:29.100 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:37:37.189 --> 01:37:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:41.510 --> 01:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
when there are areas of
 
01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:42.709 align:start position:0%
when there are areas of
um

01:37:42.709 --> 01:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:44.629 --> 01:37:44.639 align:start position:0%
the the industry
 
01:37:49.490 --> 01:37:49.500 align:start position:0%
or elements of of Regulation
 
01:37:49.500 --> 01:37:51.470 align:start position:0%
or elements of of Regulation
that

01:37:51.470 --> 01:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:37:54.310 --> 01:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
Merit further study
 
01:37:57.649 --> 01:37:57.659 align:start position:0%
an investigation is an option for us
 
01:38:00.770 --> 01:38:00.780 align:start position:0%
the general court from time to time has
 
01:38:03.830 --> 01:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
directed that the commission opens an
 
01:38:05.209 --> 01:38:05.219 align:start position:0%
investigation and there have been
 
01:38:07.370 --> 01:38:07.380 align:start position:0%
investigations into things like electric
 
01:38:09.530 --> 01:38:09.540 align:start position:0%
vehicle time of use rates that was an
 
01:38:10.669 --> 01:38:10.679 align:start position:0%
investigation that the commission
 
01:38:12.830 --> 01:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
conducted a couple of years ago
 
01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:14.149 align:start position:0%
conducted a couple of years ago
um

01:38:14.149 --> 01:38:14.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:16.189 --> 01:38:16.199 align:start position:0%
the the commission has also opened
 
01:38:17.810 --> 01:38:17.820 align:start position:0%
investigations on our own initiative and
 
01:38:20.209 --> 01:38:20.219 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you're you're thinking about uh
 
01:38:22.070 --> 01:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
some recent ones like Energy Efficiency
 
01:38:25.370 --> 01:38:25.380 align:start position:0%
or the investigation that we have into
 
01:38:28.550 --> 01:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
the provision of of uh default electric
 
01:38:31.629 --> 01:38:31.639 align:start position:0%
service and gas service
 
01:38:35.990 --> 01:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
because of our roles as as adjudicators
 
01:38:39.649 --> 01:38:39.659 align:start position:0%
we're governed by ethical duties uh and
 
01:38:43.629 --> 01:38:43.639 align:start position:0%
ex parte in that we we cannot engage
 
01:38:46.430 --> 01:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
with open matters before the commission
 
01:38:49.070 --> 01:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
with the public everything that we do is
 
01:38:51.290 --> 01:38:51.300 align:start position:0%
is on the record submitted to us through
 
01:38:53.030 --> 01:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
a public forum and that protects
 
01:38:56.169 --> 01:38:56.179 align:start position:0%
customers that protects the process
 
01:39:00.110 --> 01:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
investigations we conduct similarly in a
 
01:39:01.390 --> 01:39:01.400 align:start position:0%
public manner
 
01:39:04.970 --> 01:39:04.980 align:start position:0%
we have an open docket we have public
 
01:39:06.950 --> 01:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
meetings that folks can come to
 
01:39:08.510 --> 01:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're called technical
 
01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:10.209 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're called technical
sessions

01:39:10.209 --> 01:39:10.219 align:start position:0%
sessions
 
01:39:13.790 --> 01:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
where there's no decision that the
 
01:39:16.010 --> 01:39:16.020 align:start position:0%
commission and is adjudicating there's
 
01:39:18.350 --> 01:39:18.360 align:start position:0%
nothing that the commission is trying to
 
01:39:21.290 --> 01:39:21.300 align:start position:0%
come to for a decision or has been asked
 
01:39:25.790 --> 01:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
to it's more when there's an issue that
 
01:39:28.430 --> 01:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
deserves uh
 
01:39:30.830 --> 01:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
further analysis and learning by the
 
01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:31.990 align:start position:0%
further analysis and learning by the
commission

01:39:31.990 --> 01:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:39:35.930 --> 01:39:35.940 align:start position:0%
so we can do that in an open uh public
 
01:39:39.530 --> 01:39:39.540 align:start position:0%
forum can get stakeholders together we
 
01:39:41.629 --> 01:39:41.639 align:start position:0%
can ask questions they can provide us
 
01:39:42.790 --> 01:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
with information
 
01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:44.350 align:start position:0%
with information
and

01:39:44.350 --> 01:39:44.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:39:47.149 --> 01:39:47.159 align:start position:0%
we can we can do that in a public way
 
01:39:51.970 --> 01:39:51.980 align:start position:0%
that enables a a conversation
 
01:39:54.890 --> 01:39:54.900 align:start position:0%
and information submitted to us to learn
 
01:39:54.900 --> 01:39:57.470 align:start position:0%
and information submitted to us to learn
more

01:39:57.470 --> 01:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:01.129 --> 01:40:01.139 align:start position:0%
a follow-up thank you so you mentioned
 
01:40:03.950 --> 01:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
the Energy Efficiency report so let me
 
01:40:07.850 --> 01:40:07.860 align:start position:0%
refer specifically to that uh what was
 
01:40:14.530 --> 01:40:14.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:17.510 --> 01:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I can I can touch on that and
 
01:40:19.129 --> 01:40:19.139 align:start position:0%
perhaps the other Commissioners would
 
01:40:21.530 --> 01:40:21.540 align:start position:0%
have some additional comments
 
01:40:24.110 --> 01:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
um I I'm the longest tenured
 
01:40:26.629 --> 01:40:26.639 align:start position:0%
commissioner at a year and a half I
 
01:40:30.110 --> 01:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
started in May of 2021 uh the
 
01:40:31.669 --> 01:40:31.679 align:start position:0%
Commissioners to my right started in
 
01:40:37.070 --> 01:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
December of that same year so we um
 
01:40:40.490 --> 01:40:40.500 align:start position:0%
we were not um in the Energy Efficiency
 
01:40:43.490 --> 01:40:43.500 align:start position:0%
dockets that preceded us we had never
 
01:40:45.770 --> 01:40:45.780 align:start position:0%
had the opportunity to ask questions or
 
01:40:48.410 --> 01:40:48.420 align:start position:0%
engage in those dockets so for us
 
01:40:50.629 --> 01:40:50.639 align:start position:0%
um this investigative DACA was an
 
01:40:52.310 --> 01:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity for us to do some learning
 
01:40:54.950 --> 01:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
and understand what at a deeper level
 
01:40:57.410 --> 01:40:57.420 align:start position:0%
what was going on in that particular
 
01:41:01.550 --> 01:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:06.950 --> 01:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:10.250 --> 01:41:10.260 align:start position:0%
I would add too I um
 
01:41:10.260 --> 01:41:12.530 align:start position:0%
I would add too I um
I

01:41:12.530 --> 01:41:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:14.689 --> 01:41:14.699 align:start position:0%
did not participate in that proceeding
 
01:41:20.330 --> 01:41:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:23.149 --> 01:41:23.159 align:start position:0%
it was before my time that it was opened
 
01:41:24.950 --> 01:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
and I understand the questions that
 
01:41:28.270 --> 01:41:28.280 align:start position:0%
arise out of it I would say that the
 
01:41:31.129 --> 01:41:31.139 align:start position:0%
investigatory ability of the commission
 
01:41:32.629 --> 01:41:32.639 align:start position:0%
is an important
 
01:41:32.639 --> 01:41:34.850 align:start position:0%
is an important
um

01:41:34.850 --> 01:41:34.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:37.609 --> 01:41:37.619 align:start position:0%
option for the commission to exercise in
 
01:41:39.189 --> 01:41:39.199 align:start position:0%
certain times
 
01:41:41.330 --> 01:41:41.340 align:start position:0%
within the scope of the Energy
 
01:41:44.450 --> 01:41:44.460 align:start position:0%
Efficiency realm there were a lot of
 
01:41:46.430 --> 01:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
administrative changes that happened
 
01:41:49.669 --> 01:41:49.679 align:start position:0%
both to the commission and within the
 
01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
space of Energy Efficiency regulation in
 
01:41:53.629 --> 01:41:53.639 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire the
 
01:41:55.689 --> 01:41:55.699 align:start position:0%
commission was restructured
 
01:41:58.550 --> 01:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
administratively in 2021 and then in
 
01:42:01.189 --> 01:42:01.199 align:start position:0%
2022 there was a statute that passed
 
01:42:03.109 --> 01:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
that directed the commission to use
 
01:42:06.590 --> 01:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
specific tests for the evaluation of
 
01:42:08.870 --> 01:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
cost benefit within the Energy
 
01:42:12.709 --> 01:42:12.719 align:start position:0%
Efficiency programs and um
 
01:42:15.229 --> 01:42:15.239 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that the commission
 
01:42:19.310 --> 01:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
at the time needed to embark on that
 
01:42:22.729 --> 01:42:22.739 align:start position:0%
investigation to better understand the
 
01:42:25.850 --> 01:42:25.860 align:start position:0%
tests that were in place that put in
 
01:42:28.850 --> 01:42:28.860 align:start position:0%
place by the legislature and would be
 
01:42:30.950 --> 01:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
used within the evaluation of Energy
 
01:42:35.810 --> 01:42:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:37.970 --> 01:42:37.980 align:start position:0%
I'll go back to representative Summers
 
01:42:40.609 --> 01:42:40.619 align:start position:0%
for a question he may have thank you Mr
 
01:42:42.709 --> 01:42:42.719 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:42:43.850 --> 01:42:43.860 align:start position:0%
question this actually will probably
 
01:42:45.590 --> 01:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
cover almost every one of your slides
 
01:42:47.090 --> 01:42:47.100 align:start position:0%
you just had here that's one question
 
01:42:50.149 --> 01:42:50.159 align:start position:0%
but um on your regulatory compact you
 
01:42:51.470 --> 01:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
had in here the utility has an
 
01:42:53.450 --> 01:42:53.460 align:start position:0%
obligation to serve and regulation
 
01:42:56.930 --> 01:42:56.940 align:start position:0%
incentives utility behavior
 
01:42:59.510 --> 01:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
um we we actually had New Hampshire
 
01:43:02.149 --> 01:43:02.159 align:start position:0%
Electric Co-op that was met in front of
 
01:43:04.310 --> 01:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
us and they had stated that their rates
 
01:43:06.649 --> 01:43:06.659 align:start position:0%
gave us our their current rates and they
 
01:43:08.149 --> 01:43:08.159 align:start position:0%
were less than half of what the
 
01:43:10.189 --> 01:43:10.199 align:start position:0%
regulated rates were for the utilities
 
01:43:10.199 --> 01:43:11.629 align:start position:0%
regulated rates were for the utilities
now

01:43:11.629 --> 01:43:11.639 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:43:13.669 --> 01:43:13.679 align:start position:0%
um they said that this was because the
 
01:43:16.189 --> 01:43:16.199 align:start position:0%
fact that they can go the market on a on
 
01:43:18.830 --> 01:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
a daily weekly monthly basis to be able
 
01:43:20.689 --> 01:43:20.699 align:start position:0%
to price compete for the price in the
 
01:43:22.669 --> 01:43:22.679 align:start position:0%
market compared to where the electric
 
01:43:24.770 --> 01:43:24.780 align:start position:0%
utilities could only go once every six
 
01:43:24.780 --> 01:43:26.270 align:start position:0%
utilities could only go once every six
months

01:43:26.270 --> 01:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
months
 
01:43:28.850 --> 01:43:28.860 align:start position:0%
um is this is the fact that they can
 
01:43:30.590 --> 01:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
only go once every six months is that
 
01:43:32.990 --> 01:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
part of the regulation how does that
 
01:43:34.790 --> 01:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
incentivize Us by them not be able to
 
01:43:37.850 --> 01:43:37.860 align:start position:0%
price compete more often it's a great
 
01:43:40.850 --> 01:43:40.860 align:start position:0%
question and we have an investigation on
 
01:43:45.830 --> 01:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
going to look into those those processes
 
01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:47.750 align:start position:0%
going to look into those those processes
um

01:43:47.750 --> 01:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:50.510 --> 01:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
I think what we see is that
 
01:43:52.910 --> 01:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
Commodities markets fluctuate on a daily
 
01:43:58.490 --> 01:43:58.500 align:start position:0%
basis a moment by moment basis and
 
01:44:02.810 --> 01:44:02.820 align:start position:0%
the utilities plan for a day when they
 
01:44:07.729 --> 01:44:07.739 align:start position:0%
go and issue an RFP to procure energy
 
01:44:07.739 --> 01:44:10.310 align:start position:0%
go and issue an RFP to procure energy
Supply

01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:12.830 align:start position:0%
 
um so

01:44:12.830 --> 01:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:44:15.350 --> 01:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
there might you might go out one day and
 
01:44:17.510 --> 01:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
the price is significantly lower than
 
01:44:19.729 --> 01:44:19.739 align:start position:0%
the next and that's due to a lot of
 
01:44:22.790 --> 01:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
global factors Supply factors unknowns
 
01:44:25.129 --> 01:44:25.139 align:start position:0%
that are hard to predict
 
01:44:28.250 --> 01:44:28.260 align:start position:0%
um similarly or or conversely I should
 
01:44:30.050 --> 01:44:30.060 align:start position:0%
say sometimes you might get a really
 
01:44:31.990 --> 01:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
good price on a day and you lock that in
 
01:44:34.250 --> 01:44:34.260 align:start position:0%
so it
 
01:44:36.770 --> 01:44:36.780 align:start position:0%
it's a process question and we're
 
01:44:39.410 --> 01:44:39.420 align:start position:0%
grappling with that ourselves and we're
 
01:44:41.390 --> 01:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
trying to gain more information through
 
01:44:45.169 --> 01:44:45.179 align:start position:0%
this investigatory process and uh
 
01:44:47.810 --> 01:44:47.820 align:start position:0%
understand what factors should be
 
01:44:51.530 --> 01:44:51.540 align:start position:0%
considered and gain feedback from the
 
01:44:54.950 --> 01:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
public about what could be changed in
 
01:44:57.590 --> 01:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
that process and how it could be better
 
01:45:00.590 --> 01:45:00.600 align:start position:0%
one follow-up quick follow-up uh is
 
01:45:02.810 --> 01:45:02.820 align:start position:0%
there anything then written in stone or
 
01:45:06.050 --> 01:45:06.060 align:start position:0%
stated that makes it the regular the
 
01:45:08.629 --> 01:45:08.639 align:start position:0%
utilities not be able to behave like the
 
01:45:21.530 --> 01:45:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:24.290 --> 01:45:24.300 align:start position:0%
it's a great question
 
01:45:26.209 --> 01:45:26.219 align:start position:0%
you you might you might get some
 
01:45:28.910 --> 01:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
assistance by looking behind you to the
 
01:45:31.430 --> 01:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
consumer advocate
 
01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:36.530 align:start position:0%
consumer advocate
foreign

01:45:36.530 --> 01:45:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:40.250 --> 01:45:40.260 align:start position:0%
I'm not a lawyer but
 
01:45:42.169 --> 01:45:42.179 align:start position:0%
um I'm just speaking
 
01:45:44.450 --> 01:45:44.460 align:start position:0%
at least I'm trying to address part of
 
01:45:46.430 --> 01:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
the question that you're asking
 
01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:47.270 align:start position:0%
the question that you're asking
um

01:45:47.270 --> 01:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:50.629 --> 01:45:50.639 align:start position:0%
through the best of my recollection
 
01:45:50.639 --> 01:45:52.010 align:start position:0%
through the best of my recollection
then

01:45:52.010 --> 01:45:52.020 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:45:54.169 --> 01:45:54.179 align:start position:0%
the restructuring happen and when the
 
01:45:56.290 --> 01:45:56.300 align:start position:0%
default Service rates were being
 
01:46:00.590 --> 01:46:00.600 align:start position:0%
put into you know place I think I think
 
01:46:02.930 --> 01:46:02.940 align:start position:0%
there was a concern about uh they
 
01:46:06.590 --> 01:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be facing the volatility that
 
01:46:09.649 --> 01:46:09.659 align:start position:0%
would result if you are letting rate
 
01:46:11.570 --> 01:46:11.580 align:start position:0%
pairs go up you know and deal with the
 
01:46:14.810 --> 01:46:14.820 align:start position:0%
prices every day okay so it's a very
 
01:46:17.209 --> 01:46:17.219 align:start position:0%
general answer from me but I think
 
01:46:20.270 --> 01:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
that's I may have seen that that is the
 
01:46:23.750 --> 01:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
reason why things were what they were
 
01:46:26.689 --> 01:46:26.699 align:start position:0%
over the last so many years but that's
 
01:46:29.689 --> 01:46:29.699 align:start position:0%
just uh my instinct is that there is a
 
01:46:31.729 --> 01:46:31.739 align:start position:0%
commission order from years and years
 
01:46:34.850 --> 01:46:34.860 align:start position:0%
ago that dictated that process I'm happy
 
01:46:37.370 --> 01:46:37.380 align:start position:0%
to go back and and look and see what
 
01:46:40.250 --> 01:46:40.260 align:start position:0%
that precedent is but I can tell you
 
01:46:42.350 --> 01:46:42.360 align:start position:0%
today that this is the process that the
 
01:46:44.209 --> 01:46:44.219 align:start position:0%
utilities have been using for years
 
01:46:48.229 --> 01:46:48.239 align:start position:0%
decades and it has not really evolved
 
01:46:50.570 --> 01:46:50.580 align:start position:0%
over that time and that's the purpose of
 
01:46:52.990 --> 01:46:53.000 align:start position:0%
this investigation is to look in into
 
01:46:56.270 --> 01:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
what might be opportunities for
 
01:46:58.729 --> 01:46:58.739 align:start position:0%
evolution in that space
 
01:47:01.850 --> 01:47:01.860 align:start position:0%
and I'll I'll take Chairman's
 
01:47:03.229 --> 01:47:03.239 align:start position:0%
prerogative to follow up on the
 
01:47:06.470 --> 01:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up to just so it's my
 
01:47:08.510 --> 01:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
understanding then it's
 
01:47:11.390 --> 01:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
it's not any state law that would
 
01:47:13.729 --> 01:47:13.739 align:start position:0%
prevent that it's just go back to review
 
01:47:16.910 --> 01:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:20.510 --> 01:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
I mean I I think um I think what
 
01:47:22.910 --> 01:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
Commissioners is a symptom chat overtai
 
01:47:24.649 --> 01:47:24.659 align:start position:0%
or we're communicating which I'll just
 
01:47:27.229 --> 01:47:27.239 align:start position:0%
augment is that you know this commission
 
01:47:29.090 --> 01:47:29.100 align:start position:0%
these Commissioners are are pretty new
 
01:47:31.070 --> 01:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
we've come into the process we've
 
01:47:33.169 --> 01:47:33.179 align:start position:0%
inherited a process we're looking at
 
01:47:35.090 --> 01:47:35.100 align:start position:0%
that process in an IR docket to see what
 
01:47:37.609 --> 01:47:37.619 align:start position:0%
we can do differently so we're very
 
01:47:40.310 --> 01:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
engaged very interested in in this and
 
01:47:43.330 --> 01:47:43.340 align:start position:0%
then on the nhec question I would say
 
01:47:46.550 --> 01:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
two that uh but probably if you go back
 
01:47:48.709 --> 01:47:48.719 align:start position:0%
and you look at a longer Horizon it
 
01:47:50.090 --> 01:47:50.100 align:start position:0%
would be interesting to see what the
 
01:47:52.430 --> 01:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
data would say there currently the natc
 
01:47:54.950 --> 01:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
rates are lower I think if we go back
 
01:47:57.189 --> 01:47:57.199 align:start position:0%
and look at history there's some
 
01:48:00.830 --> 01:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
perturbations in that in that analysis
 
01:48:02.870 --> 01:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
and we we'd be happy to go back and
 
01:48:05.750 --> 01:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
gather that data and uh and send that to
 
01:48:07.910 --> 01:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
this committee if that's helpful
 
01:48:10.669 --> 01:48:10.679 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative munz has a
 
01:48:12.830 --> 01:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
question yeah I think my my questions
 
01:48:14.570 --> 01:48:14.580 align:start position:0%
along the same lines here I mean I do
 
01:48:16.990 --> 01:48:17.000 align:start position:0%
think it would be really interesting to
 
01:48:22.010 --> 01:48:22.020 align:start position:0%
know whether the the um the standard of
 
01:48:24.350 --> 01:48:24.360 align:start position:0%
setting rates every six months is
 
01:48:26.149 --> 01:48:26.159 align:start position:0%
something that has been set by Statute
 
01:48:28.490 --> 01:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
or just and therefore we have to do
 
01:48:31.850 --> 01:48:31.860 align:start position:0%
something or whether it's just um you
 
01:48:35.030 --> 01:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
know an order that you can then revise
 
01:48:36.950 --> 01:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
so I think it would be very helpful to
 
01:48:38.149 --> 01:48:38.159 align:start position:0%
know that
 
01:48:39.890 --> 01:48:39.900 align:start position:0%
that's a great question and we'll follow
 
01:48:41.330 --> 01:48:41.340 align:start position:0%
up with you on that
 
01:48:43.250 --> 01:48:43.260 align:start position:0%
at this point I'd like to reserve the
 
01:48:44.570 --> 01:48:44.580 align:start position:0%
rest of your time to finish your
 
01:48:46.070 --> 01:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
presentation so we can have a few
 
01:48:48.410 --> 01:48:48.420 align:start position:0%
questions after that please sure so I'll
 
01:48:51.410 --> 01:48:51.420 align:start position:0%
move as quickly as I can uh one of the
 
01:48:54.229 --> 01:48:54.239 align:start position:0%
the really relevant Federal statutes
 
01:48:57.649 --> 01:48:57.659 align:start position:0%
that has transformed the landscape of
 
01:49:00.890 --> 01:49:00.900 align:start position:0%
utility regulation over the last 50
 
01:49:02.930 --> 01:49:02.940 align:start position:0%
years or so was perpa the public
 
01:49:06.109 --> 01:49:06.119 align:start position:0%
utilities regulatory Policy Act of 1978.
 
01:49:08.090 --> 01:49:08.100 align:start position:0%
this came about following the energy
 
01:49:10.850 --> 01:49:10.860 align:start position:0%
crisis in the early 70s and it was
 
01:49:12.229 --> 01:49:12.239 align:start position:0%
implemented to encourage energy
 
01:49:15.169 --> 01:49:15.179 align:start position:0%
conservation fuel diversity Equitable
 
01:49:17.450 --> 01:49:17.460 align:start position:0%
rates and enhance competition for
 
01:49:19.910 --> 01:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
supply-side resources in the Electric
 
01:49:21.649 --> 01:49:21.659 align:start position:0%
market you might have heard the term
 
01:49:23.870 --> 01:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
qualifying facilities and that really
 
01:49:27.410 --> 01:49:27.420 align:start position:0%
stemmed from this policy from purpa
 
01:49:30.729 --> 01:49:30.739 align:start position:0%
which stimulated Market competition
 
01:49:34.189 --> 01:49:34.199 align:start position:0%
that has led to restructured States like
 
01:49:36.649 --> 01:49:36.659 align:start position:0%
we are in New Hampshire
 
01:49:39.590 --> 01:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
and underperpa what these competitive
 
01:49:42.109 --> 01:49:42.119 align:start position:0%
market generators are entitled to is
 
01:49:44.450 --> 01:49:44.460 align:start position:0%
What's called the avoided cost so what
 
01:49:46.689 --> 01:49:46.699 align:start position:0%
the vertically integrated or the utility
 
01:49:49.850 --> 01:49:49.860 align:start position:0%
Monopoly that would own generation what
 
01:49:53.090 --> 01:49:53.100 align:start position:0%
they would have to pay uh if they built
 
01:49:55.790 --> 01:49:55.800 align:start position:0%
new generation and can subsequently
 
01:49:58.910 --> 01:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
avoid by purchasing power on the
 
01:50:01.570 --> 01:50:01.580 align:start position:0%
competitive market
 
01:50:05.270 --> 01:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
the next slide shows a map of the US and
 
01:50:07.609 --> 01:50:07.619 align:start position:0%
the state of deregulation on the
 
01:50:09.649 --> 01:50:09.659 align:start position:0%
electric side there's about a third of
 
01:50:11.930 --> 01:50:11.940 align:start position:0%
the states in the United States that
 
01:50:14.470 --> 01:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
have restructured or deregulated
 
01:50:17.530 --> 01:50:17.540 align:start position:0%
electricity markets some states have
 
01:50:20.649 --> 01:50:20.659 align:start position:0%
deregulated gas markets in New Hampshire
 
01:50:23.149 --> 01:50:23.159 align:start position:0%
commercial and Industrial customers have
 
01:50:25.729 --> 01:50:25.739 align:start position:0%
the option to shop around for their gas
 
01:50:30.169 --> 01:50:30.179 align:start position:0%
supply similar to Electric customers
 
01:50:33.229 --> 01:50:33.239 align:start position:0%
if you go to the next slide this just
 
01:50:35.750 --> 01:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
shows the regional transmission
 
01:50:38.570 --> 01:50:38.580 align:start position:0%
organizations that exist across the
 
01:50:41.709 --> 01:50:41.719 align:start position:0%
country We Exist within ISO New England
 
01:50:44.990 --> 01:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
they are the RTO the regional
 
01:50:47.209 --> 01:50:47.219 align:start position:0%
transmission organization that runs and
 
01:50:49.370 --> 01:50:49.380 align:start position:0%
operates the regional grid and there are
 
01:50:51.590 --> 01:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
several others across the country some
 
01:50:54.709 --> 01:50:54.719 align:start position:0%
states are not in an RTO and individual
 
01:50:57.169 --> 01:50:57.179 align:start position:0%
utilities within States perform these
 
01:50:59.810 --> 01:50:59.820 align:start position:0%
functions but we are within the
 
01:51:02.570 --> 01:51:02.580 align:start position:0%
Northeast New England Regional grid
 
01:51:04.189 --> 01:51:04.199 align:start position:0%
next slide
 
01:51:06.530 --> 01:51:06.540 align:start position:0%
this shows ISO New England's control
 
01:51:09.169 --> 01:51:09.179 align:start position:0%
room they have a control room in Holyoke
 
01:51:11.510 --> 01:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts where they operate the
 
01:51:13.070 --> 01:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
regional grid
 
01:51:13.080 --> 01:51:14.090 align:start position:0%
regional grid
um

01:51:14.090 --> 01:51:14.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:17.450 --> 01:51:17.460 align:start position:0%
rates within the region are regulated by
 
01:51:19.729 --> 01:51:19.739 align:start position:0%
ferc and ISO New England has tariffs
 
01:51:22.310 --> 01:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
that are regulated by ferc their job is
 
01:51:24.590 --> 01:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
to ensure the reliability of the
 
01:51:27.169 --> 01:51:27.179 align:start position:0%
interstate transmission system and to
 
01:51:29.450 --> 01:51:29.460 align:start position:0%
administer the Region's competitive
 
01:51:32.149 --> 01:51:32.159 align:start position:0%
wholesale electricity markets
 
01:51:34.910 --> 01:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
next slide
 
01:51:36.470 --> 01:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
um the Federal Energy Regulatory
 
01:51:39.470 --> 01:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
Commission is is the puc's analog at a
 
01:51:41.149 --> 01:51:41.159 align:start position:0%
federal level
 
01:51:42.950 --> 01:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
um ferc is composed of five
 
01:51:45.709 --> 01:51:45.719 align:start position:0%
Commissioners as opposed to three
 
01:51:47.570 --> 01:51:47.580 align:start position:0%
um they're all appointed by the
 
01:51:49.790 --> 01:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
president of the United States uh with
 
01:51:51.530 --> 01:51:51.540 align:start position:0%
the advice and approval of the United
 
01:51:53.930 --> 01:51:53.940 align:start position:0%
States Senate Commissioners on ferc
 
01:51:55.729 --> 01:51:55.739 align:start position:0%
serve five-year terms and have an equal
 
01:51:59.270 --> 01:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
vote on regulatory matters just like the
 
01:52:02.750 --> 01:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:05.090 --> 01:52:05.100 align:start position:0%
and then my last two slides uh just
 
01:52:07.129 --> 01:52:07.139 align:start position:0%
discussed some Regional entities and
 
01:52:09.350 --> 01:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
National entity that we work closely
 
01:52:12.590 --> 01:52:12.600 align:start position:0%
with for New England the New England
 
01:52:14.689 --> 01:52:14.699 align:start position:0%
Conference of Public Utilities
 
01:52:18.129 --> 01:52:18.139 align:start position:0%
Commissioners or neck Puck is the
 
01:52:22.070 --> 01:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
Consortium of utility Regulators in New
 
01:52:22.080 --> 01:52:23.390 align:start position:0%
Consortium of utility Regulators in New
England

01:52:23.390 --> 01:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
England
 
01:52:26.209 --> 01:52:26.219 align:start position:0%
um they're a non-profit corporation that
 
01:52:28.129 --> 01:52:28.139 align:start position:0%
provides Regional regulatory assistance
 
01:52:30.470 --> 01:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
on matters of common concern to Public
 
01:52:32.810 --> 01:52:32.820 align:start position:0%
Utilities commissions convene meetings
 
01:52:35.810 --> 01:52:35.820 align:start position:0%
organize different meetings with
 
01:52:38.450 --> 01:52:38.460 align:start position:0%
Commissioners across New England they
 
01:52:40.310 --> 01:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
don't have any independent regulatory
 
01:52:43.070 --> 01:52:43.080 align:start position:0%
Authority it's just a Consortium that
 
01:52:45.290 --> 01:52:45.300 align:start position:0%
organizes utility Commissioners across
 
01:52:46.669 --> 01:52:46.679 align:start position:0%
the region
 
01:52:49.250 --> 01:52:49.260 align:start position:0%
and then next slide similarly their
 
01:52:52.129 --> 01:52:52.139 align:start position:0%
Federal analog is narok the National
 
01:52:54.770 --> 01:52:54.780 align:start position:0%
Association of regulatory utility
 
01:52:57.669 --> 01:52:57.679 align:start position:0%
Commissioners it's one of the oldest
 
01:53:00.229 --> 01:53:00.239 align:start position:0%
associations of its type in the country
 
01:53:03.169 --> 01:53:03.179 align:start position:0%
it's a non-profit that serves State
 
01:53:03.179 --> 01:53:04.570 align:start position:0%
it's a non-profit that serves State
commissions

01:53:04.570 --> 01:53:04.580 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
01:53:07.430 --> 01:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
and they work to improve the quality and
 
01:53:09.169 --> 01:53:09.179 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of public utility
 
01:53:11.390 --> 01:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
regulation they work on a lot of papers
 
01:53:14.510 --> 01:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
do research have meetings that convene
 
01:53:14.520 --> 01:53:16.070 align:start position:0%
do research have meetings that convene
discussions

01:53:16.070 --> 01:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
discussions
 
01:53:18.470 --> 01:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
um and it's it's something that state
 
01:53:20.689 --> 01:53:20.699 align:start position:0%
Regulators from around the country are
 
01:53:22.010 --> 01:53:22.020 align:start position:0%
involved in
 
01:53:23.629 --> 01:53:23.639 align:start position:0%
so that's the end of our presentation
 
01:53:26.270 --> 01:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we're happy to take any further
 
01:53:27.770 --> 01:53:27.780 align:start position:0%
questions that you all might have thank
 
01:53:27.780 --> 01:53:30.669 align:start position:0%
questions that you all might have thank
you

01:53:30.669 --> 01:53:30.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:33.709 --> 01:53:33.719 align:start position:0%
representative um Corman has a question
 
01:53:36.530 --> 01:53:36.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:53:40.790 --> 01:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
um so the puc has a certain role uh the
 
01:53:43.010 --> 01:53:43.020 align:start position:0%
doe has a certain role the general court
 
01:53:46.010 --> 01:53:46.020 align:start position:0%
has a certain role Office of Consumer
 
01:53:47.270 --> 01:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
Advocate has a certain role everybody
 
01:53:49.910 --> 01:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
has a role do you feel like these roles
 
01:53:53.090 --> 01:53:53.100 align:start position:0%
are clearly defined do you feel like the
 
01:53:56.030 --> 01:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
general court should clarify things any
 
01:53:56.040 --> 01:53:59.689 align:start position:0%
general court should clarify things any
further

01:53:59.689 --> 01:53:59.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:59.699 --> 01:54:06.229 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:54:06.229 --> 01:54:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:10.209 --> 01:54:10.219 align:start position:0%
you know I I think that um
 
01:54:15.530 --> 01:54:15.540 align:start position:0%
that the change made on July 1st of uh
 
01:54:18.290 --> 01:54:18.300 align:start position:0%
of 2021
 
01:54:20.810 --> 01:54:20.820 align:start position:0%
um everyone has been working really hard
 
01:54:23.270 --> 01:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
to make those adjustments and and and
 
01:54:26.330 --> 01:54:26.340 align:start position:0%
move forward and and sort through all
 
01:54:28.070 --> 01:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
the different challenges associated with
 
01:54:32.030 --> 01:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
the reorganization and uh I I answered
 
01:54:34.609 --> 01:54:34.619 align:start position:0%
your question I think would be that I
 
01:54:36.109 --> 01:54:36.119 align:start position:0%
think there are some Growing Pains
 
01:54:38.750 --> 01:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
there's always challenges but I do think
 
01:54:38.760 --> 01:54:39.770 align:start position:0%
there's always challenges but I do think
that

01:54:39.770 --> 01:54:39.780 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:54:43.490 --> 01:54:43.500 align:start position:0%
um I do think that uh the change was
 
01:54:45.709 --> 01:54:45.719 align:start position:0%
well defined and I think that we have a
 
01:54:48.590 --> 01:54:48.600 align:start position:0%
good understanding of our role inside of
 
01:54:56.390 --> 01:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:59.209 --> 01:54:59.219 align:start position:0%
I see representative munz has a last
 
01:54:59.219 --> 01:55:00.890 align:start position:0%
I see representative munz has a last
question

01:55:00.890 --> 01:55:00.900 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:55:04.010 --> 01:55:04.020 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'll I'll say represent months
 
01:55:05.689 --> 01:55:05.699 align:start position:0%
and then represent a partial will have
 
01:55:09.050 --> 01:55:09.060 align:start position:0%
the last question go ahead thank you
 
01:55:10.609 --> 01:55:10.619 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:55:13.430 --> 01:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
um in one of the early slides where you
 
01:55:14.990 --> 01:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
were talking about the old versus new
 
01:55:18.470 --> 01:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
puc you mentioned that the the doe
 
01:55:20.570 --> 01:55:20.580 align:start position:0%
provides the commission with independent
 
01:55:23.149 --> 01:55:23.159 align:start position:0%
information on the record
 
01:55:23.159 --> 01:55:23.930 align:start position:0%
information on the record
um

01:55:23.930 --> 01:55:23.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:26.750 --> 01:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
given that the doe is an executive
 
01:55:26.760 --> 01:55:27.850 align:start position:0%
given that the doe is an executive
department

01:55:27.850 --> 01:55:27.860 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:55:30.470 --> 01:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
how independent is that information
 
01:55:32.629 --> 01:55:32.639 align:start position:0%
versus you know you doing it yourself
 
01:55:39.530 --> 01:55:39.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:41.629 --> 01:55:41.639 align:start position:0%
yeah I think I'll try to answer the
 
01:55:43.129 --> 01:55:43.139 align:start position:0%
question I can't uh I can't really
 
01:55:44.990 --> 01:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
answer the question about the Doe's
 
01:55:46.550 --> 01:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
objectivity would be a better question
 
01:55:48.649 --> 01:55:48.659 align:start position:0%
for the doe than it would be for the puc
 
01:55:51.709 --> 01:55:51.719 align:start position:0%
but I know that the OCA who's here today
 
01:55:55.129 --> 01:55:55.139 align:start position:0%
and the doe who's a mandatory party to
 
01:55:58.129 --> 01:55:58.139 align:start position:0%
all our proceedings provide extremely
 
01:55:59.810 --> 01:55:59.820 align:start position:0%
valuable and really necessary
 
01:56:02.570 --> 01:56:02.580 align:start position:0%
information for us to balance the
 
01:56:05.390 --> 01:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
interests of the monopolies the
 
01:56:08.629 --> 01:56:08.639 align:start position:0%
utilities with the residential repairs
 
01:56:11.030 --> 01:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
and with all of the other different
 
01:56:12.770 --> 01:56:12.780 align:start position:0%
pieces and different attributes that we
 
01:56:15.169 --> 01:56:15.179 align:start position:0%
need to consider so I would just say the
 
01:56:18.410 --> 01:56:18.420 align:start position:0%
doe is a critical part of us getting the
 
01:56:21.470 --> 01:56:21.480 align:start position:0%
information that we need and I um I
 
01:56:23.090 --> 01:56:23.100 align:start position:0%
don't know how to uh I don't know how to
 
01:56:27.790 --> 01:56:27.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:30.830 --> 01:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
okay I represent partial uh please
 
01:56:33.109 --> 01:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
finish up her excellent presentation
 
01:56:35.030 --> 01:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
here with your question thank you chair
 
01:56:36.770 --> 01:56:36.780 align:start position:0%
and thank you again
 
01:56:39.169 --> 01:56:39.179 align:start position:0%
um first a comment and a question I'd
 
01:56:41.570 --> 01:56:41.580 align:start position:0%
love to see John Stuart Mills quoted in
 
01:56:43.790 --> 01:56:43.800 align:start position:0%
any presentation and I thank you for
 
01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:45.709 align:start position:0%
any presentation and I thank you for
that

01:56:45.709 --> 01:56:45.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:56:46.970 --> 01:56:46.980 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that purple means to
 
01:56:49.129 --> 01:56:49.139 align:start position:0%
encourage energy conversation
 
01:56:51.410 --> 01:56:51.420 align:start position:0%
recently the puc released a report on
 
01:56:53.090 --> 01:56:53.100 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency planning programming
 
01:56:55.669 --> 01:56:55.679 align:start position:0%
and evaluation was mentioned earlier the
 
01:56:57.169 --> 01:56:57.179 align:start position:0%
device program such as New Hampshire
 
01:56:59.090 --> 01:56:59.100 align:start position:0%
saves and some say puts a thumb on it
 
01:57:01.189 --> 01:57:01.199 align:start position:0%
the report claims that the granite state
 
01:57:03.770 --> 01:57:03.780 align:start position:0%
test is asymmetrical and inconsistent
 
01:57:06.290 --> 01:57:06.300 align:start position:0%
with industry Norms on the surface it
 
01:57:07.850 --> 01:57:07.860 align:start position:0%
appears to be inconsistent with the
 
01:57:09.530 --> 01:57:09.540 align:start position:0%
findings of our benefit cost work group
 
01:57:12.830 --> 01:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
report conducted in 2019. I think I'd be
 
01:57:14.689 --> 01:57:14.699 align:start position:0%
remiss if I did not ask for further
 
01:57:17.030 --> 01:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
comment from the POC this time though I
 
01:57:18.589 --> 01:57:18.599 align:start position:0%
do understand that time constraints May
 
01:57:26.390 --> 01:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:34.669 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:57:34.669 --> 01:57:34.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:37.550 --> 01:57:37.560 align:start position:0%
based on the
 
01:57:40.070 --> 01:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
the record request responses that we had
 
01:57:43.070 --> 01:57:43.080 align:start position:0%
received in that docket we are simply
 
01:57:45.229 --> 01:57:45.239 align:start position:0%
trying to analyze the information
 
01:57:49.729 --> 01:57:49.739 align:start position:0%
and I think it would be incorrect to
 
01:57:52.250 --> 01:57:52.260 align:start position:0%
um assume that that is how we
 
01:57:55.250 --> 01:57:55.260 align:start position:0%
necessarily look at it it's just a sort
 
01:57:56.570 --> 01:57:56.580 align:start position:0%
of a question
 
01:58:00.770 --> 01:58:00.780 align:start position:0%
and um coming from
 
01:58:00.780 --> 01:58:02.890 align:start position:0%
and um coming from
from

01:58:02.890 --> 01:58:02.900 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:58:07.030 --> 01:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
my vantage point I mean it's it's it's
 
01:58:08.930 --> 01:58:08.940 align:start position:0%
there is
 
01:58:12.589 --> 01:58:12.599 align:start position:0%
the the economics based question about
 
01:58:15.950 --> 01:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
what do you mean by society in which
 
01:58:17.750 --> 01:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
when you talk about societal benefits
 
01:58:20.089 --> 01:58:20.099 align:start position:0%
and all of that so it's not a very we we
 
01:58:22.250 --> 01:58:22.260 align:start position:0%
weren't really reaching any conclusions
 
01:58:24.890 --> 01:58:24.900 align:start position:0%
it was just looking at the substance and
 
01:58:28.070 --> 01:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
coming to an understanding of what it
 
01:58:31.490 --> 01:58:31.500 align:start position:0%
means to us we have we are still
 
01:58:35.330 --> 01:58:35.340 align:start position:0%
learning and we are getting we have
 
01:58:38.030 --> 01:58:38.040 align:start position:0%
gotten comments in the docket and I
 
01:58:41.330 --> 01:58:41.340 align:start position:0%
think it's would be good for anybody to
 
01:58:42.770 --> 01:58:42.780 align:start position:0%
take a look at it
 
01:58:45.830 --> 01:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
I can tell you we are still it's just
 
01:58:50.089 --> 01:58:50.099 align:start position:0%
that docket was really meant to improve
 
01:58:52.490 --> 01:58:52.500 align:start position:0%
our understanding of what things are and
 
01:58:54.229 --> 01:58:54.239 align:start position:0%
it's it's still in sort of an ongoing
 
01:58:54.239 --> 01:58:55.490 align:start position:0%
it's it's still in sort of an ongoing
process

01:58:55.490 --> 01:58:55.500 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:58:57.649 --> 01:58:57.659 align:start position:0%
oh right
 
01:59:00.109 --> 01:59:00.119 align:start position:0%
uh well thank you
 
01:59:03.229 --> 01:59:03.239 align:start position:0%
um yes I love good questions to me
 
01:59:04.550 --> 01:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
they're better than good answers because
 
01:59:07.070 --> 01:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
it's questions that move us forward
 
01:59:09.410 --> 01:59:09.420 align:start position:0%
um my concern and maybe you can quiet
 
01:59:12.109 --> 01:59:12.119 align:start position:0%
this concern is that
 
01:59:14.330 --> 01:59:14.340 align:start position:0%
um asking these kind of questions
 
01:59:17.450 --> 01:59:17.460 align:start position:0%
tends to point to certain directions and
 
01:59:22.250 --> 01:59:22.260 align:start position:0%
tips the hand of the puc's what you see
 
01:59:23.629 --> 01:59:23.639 align:start position:0%
is planning in the future
 
01:59:26.390 --> 01:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
would you say that that would should not
 
01:59:29.270 --> 01:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:29.280 --> 01:59:31.689 align:start position:0%
 
Ed

01:59:31.689 --> 01:59:31.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:34.609 --> 01:59:34.619 align:start position:0%
tonight the
 
01:59:36.649 --> 01:59:36.659 align:start position:0%
um can you um it would be helpful to
 
01:59:39.350 --> 01:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
point this to a particular section or a
 
01:59:42.290 --> 01:59:42.300 align:start position:0%
particular question or concern that you
 
01:59:44.390 --> 01:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
have relative to the uh
 
01:59:48.109 --> 01:59:48.119 align:start position:0%
relative to the um the the report is
 
01:59:49.729 --> 01:59:49.739 align:start position:0%
there a specific area that you're
 
01:59:51.109 --> 01:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
concerned about where I'm just trying to
 
01:59:53.510 --> 01:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
understand your question
 
01:59:53.520 --> 01:59:54.129 align:start position:0%
understand your question
um

01:59:54.129 --> 01:59:54.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:56.930 --> 01:59:56.940 align:start position:0%
well my general concern is the
 
02:00:00.210 --> 02:00:00.220 align:start position:0%
preservation of New Hampshire safes and
 
02:00:00.220 --> 02:00:00.589 align:start position:0%
preservation of New Hampshire safes and
[Music]

02:00:00.589 --> 02:00:00.599 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:00:00.599 --> 02:00:02.689 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

02:00:02.689 --> 02:00:02.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:06.350 --> 02:00:06.360 align:start position:0%
this report seems to devalue the work
 
02:00:08.330 --> 02:00:08.340 align:start position:0%
that is being done
 
02:00:11.510 --> 02:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh by New Hampshire saves
 
02:00:11.520 --> 02:00:12.950 align:start position:0%
uh by New Hampshire saves
um

02:00:12.950 --> 02:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:15.589 --> 02:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
and I'm just wondering if it tips the
 
02:00:17.990 --> 02:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
hand unfairly
 
02:00:20.270 --> 02:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
to other
 
02:00:22.790 --> 02:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
away from New Hampshire saves okay thank
 
02:00:25.669 --> 02:00:25.679 align:start position:0%
you for the clarification I think I
 
02:00:27.950 --> 02:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
would say in the other Commissioners can
 
02:00:29.990 --> 02:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
certainly comment as well is that the
 
02:00:32.390 --> 02:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
general court was clear about the amount
 
02:00:34.490 --> 02:00:34.500 align:start position:0%
of money that they want to spend on
 
02:00:36.350 --> 02:00:36.360 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency and New Hampshire
 
02:00:38.510 --> 02:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
saves here in New Hampshire I think it's
 
02:00:41.450 --> 02:00:41.460 align:start position:0%
roughly 75 million dollars a year as I
 
02:00:41.460 --> 02:00:42.410 align:start position:0%
roughly 75 million dollars a year as I
recall

02:00:42.410 --> 02:00:42.420 align:start position:0%
recall
 
02:00:46.430 --> 02:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
in the commission inside of that has the
 
02:00:48.709 --> 02:00:48.719 align:start position:0%
obligation to understand what's being
 
02:00:50.270 --> 02:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
spent and how it's being spent and make
 
02:00:51.350 --> 02:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
sure it's being spent in a
 
02:00:53.030 --> 02:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
cost-effective fashion so that's our
 
02:00:56.089 --> 02:00:56.099 align:start position:0%
role in that so we're respectful of
 
02:00:57.709 --> 02:00:57.719 align:start position:0%
course that the general court has
 
02:00:59.330 --> 02:00:59.340 align:start position:0%
provided and appreciate the fact that
 
02:01:00.890 --> 02:01:00.900 align:start position:0%
the general court has provided Clarity
 
02:01:03.290 --> 02:01:03.300 align:start position:0%
and the amount of spending and that that
 
02:01:05.149 --> 02:01:05.159 align:start position:0%
in many ways makes our role more
 
02:01:07.189 --> 02:01:07.199 align:start position:0%
understandable and easier to execute
 
02:01:10.030 --> 02:01:10.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for that answer thank you
 
02:01:11.930 --> 02:01:11.940 align:start position:0%
or something
 
02:01:14.270 --> 02:01:14.280 align:start position:0%
I'll just say for myself I'm very
 
02:01:16.609 --> 02:01:16.619 align:start position:0%
interested in Energy Efficiency as I as
 
02:01:17.930 --> 02:01:17.940 align:start position:0%
I mentioned earlier I have a background
 
02:01:20.890 --> 02:01:20.900 align:start position:0%
in electric power engineering and I view
 
02:01:23.570 --> 02:01:23.580 align:start position:0%
the efficient operation of energy
 
02:01:26.330 --> 02:01:26.340 align:start position:0%
systems as critical to ensure cost
 
02:01:28.270 --> 02:01:28.280 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness success
 
02:01:31.370 --> 02:01:31.380 align:start position:0%
and reliability I think that there's a
 
02:01:34.129 --> 02:01:34.139 align:start position:0%
lot of opportunities that can be done in
 
02:01:36.890 --> 02:01:36.900 align:start position:0%
that space and build upon the the work
 
02:01:38.870 --> 02:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
that's been done over the past 20 years
 
02:01:41.930 --> 02:01:41.940 align:start position:0%
the com the legislature made very clear
 
02:01:46.790 --> 02:01:46.800 align:start position:0%
in 1996 when when it passed RSA 374f
 
02:01:49.790 --> 02:01:49.800 align:start position:0%
that Energy Efficiency is a priority of
 
02:01:51.709 --> 02:01:51.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and it remains a priority
 
02:01:54.770 --> 02:01:54.780 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire codified in statute
 
02:01:54.780 --> 02:01:56.030 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire codified in statute
um

02:01:56.030 --> 02:01:56.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:59.990 --> 02:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
I speaking on behalf of myself
 
02:02:02.689 --> 02:02:02.699 align:start position:0%
I view the programs that the utilities
 
02:02:04.669 --> 02:02:04.679 align:start position:0%
have administered over the last 20ish
 
02:02:06.490 --> 02:02:06.500 align:start position:0%
years as successful
 
02:02:06.500 --> 02:02:08.470 align:start position:0%
years as successful
and

02:02:08.470 --> 02:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:02:12.890 --> 02:02:12.900 align:start position:0%
just like we're looking at evolution in
 
02:02:17.390 --> 02:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
the space of energy procurement I think
 
02:02:19.870 --> 02:02:19.880 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot of opportunity for
 
02:02:24.189 --> 02:02:24.199 align:start position:0%
technology to be a critical part of
 
02:02:27.830 --> 02:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
enabling customer control demand side
 
02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:29.629 align:start position:0%
enabling customer control demand side
control

02:02:29.629 --> 02:02:29.639 align:start position:0%
control
 
02:02:29.639 --> 02:02:30.410 align:start position:0%
control
um

02:02:30.410 --> 02:02:30.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:33.910 --> 02:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
and it remains a a
 
02:02:37.070 --> 02:02:37.080 align:start position:0%
strategy that is important for the state
 
02:02:41.330 --> 02:02:41.340 align:start position:0%
and we we remain committed to that
 
02:02:43.010 --> 02:02:43.020 align:start position:0%
well I want to thank the three of you
 
02:02:44.810 --> 02:02:44.820 align:start position:0%
for being here today I also want to be
 
02:02:47.629 --> 02:02:47.639 align:start position:0%
respectful of your hard stop at 11
 
02:02:50.810 --> 02:02:50.820 align:start position:0%
o'clock which it is right at this moment
 
02:02:54.530 --> 02:02:54.540 align:start position:0%
so once again we we say uh to you that
 
02:02:55.970 --> 02:02:55.980 align:start position:0%
we appreciate you being here we
 
02:02:57.729 --> 02:02:57.739 align:start position:0%
appreciate this excellent presentation
 
02:03:00.410 --> 02:03:00.420 align:start position:0%
and your willingness to answer our
 
02:03:02.390 --> 02:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
questions and we'll look forward to

02:11:27.709 --> 02:11:27.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:31.490 --> 02:11:31.500 align:start position:0%
I officially opened the
 
02:11:37.070 --> 02:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:40.129 --> 02:11:40.139 align:start position:0%
which is an act relative to her report
 
02:11:42.109 --> 02:11:42.119 align:start position:0%
by the department of energy on the
 
02:11:44.149 --> 02:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of the system benefits
 
02:11:44.159 --> 02:11:44.930 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of the system benefits
charge

02:11:44.930 --> 02:11:44.940 align:start position:0%
charge
 
02:11:48.229 --> 02:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
and I call to the testimony table the
 
02:11:50.030 --> 02:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of the bill
 
02:11:51.649 --> 02:11:51.659 align:start position:0%
and vice chair of this committee
 
02:11:54.050 --> 02:11:54.060 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas
 
02:11:56.270 --> 02:11:56.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you to the
 
02:11:59.030 --> 02:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
committee members for hearing my bill
 
02:12:02.750 --> 02:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
this bill is a housekeeping Bill and it
 
02:12:05.870 --> 02:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
was asked by the Department of
 
02:12:09.350 --> 02:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services to present it it
 
02:12:12.490 --> 02:12:12.500 align:start position:0%
was a result of action we took last
 
02:12:15.950 --> 02:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
biennium to eliminate the electric
 
02:12:17.870 --> 02:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
oversight committee and we had to
 
02:12:17.880 --> 02:12:19.209 align:start position:0%
oversight committee and we had to
rearrange

02:12:19.209 --> 02:12:19.219 align:start position:0%
rearrange
 
02:12:22.490 --> 02:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
reports about where uh other reports
 
02:12:24.250 --> 02:12:24.260 align:start position:0%
that were contained in that original
 
02:12:28.669 --> 02:12:28.679 align:start position:0%
regulation to be sent as a result of the
 
02:12:31.250 --> 02:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
Department of energy being being formed
 
02:12:34.430 --> 02:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
and the result of the elimination of the
 
02:12:36.709 --> 02:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
of the oversight committee the
 
02:12:38.870 --> 02:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services no
 
02:12:42.589 --> 02:12:42.599 align:start position:0%
longer has a a role to play in
 
02:12:46.490 --> 02:12:46.500 align:start position:0%
submitting a a report on the citizens
 
02:12:49.790 --> 02:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
benefits charge so they said this was a
 
02:12:52.250 --> 02:12:52.260 align:start position:0%
typographical Old Mission that we didn't
 
02:12:54.229 --> 02:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
get rid of and they requested just to be
 
02:12:57.109 --> 02:12:57.119 align:start position:0%
to be removed from that and that's the
 
02:12:59.089 --> 02:12:59.099 align:start position:0%
basis of this bill it's just to correct
 
02:13:01.250 --> 02:13:01.260 align:start position:0%
an error that was overlooked less
 
02:13:01.260 --> 02:13:04.729 align:start position:0%
an error that was overlooked less
biennium

02:13:04.729 --> 02:13:04.739 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:07.010 --> 02:13:07.020 align:start position:0%
thank you representative seems like a
 
02:13:09.109 --> 02:13:09.119 align:start position:0%
fairly simple and straightforward Bill
 
02:13:11.569 --> 02:13:11.579 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee about
 
02:13:17.990 --> 02:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:21.430 --> 02:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll call forward
 
02:13:24.410 --> 02:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
the next person to testify on this bill
 
02:13:26.569 --> 02:13:26.579 align:start position:0%
that would be Griffin Roberge from the
 
02:13:34.430 --> 02:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:34.440 --> 02:13:35.990 align:start position:0%
 
wow

02:13:35.990 --> 02:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
wow
 
02:13:37.850 --> 02:13:37.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
02:13:39.470 --> 02:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record Griffin
 
02:13:40.490 --> 02:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
Roberge from the New Hampshire
 
02:13:42.950 --> 02:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
Department of energy I'll keep my
 
02:13:45.470 --> 02:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
testimony brief House Bill 211 is a good
 
02:13:47.270 --> 02:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
bill you should support it
 
02:13:50.629 --> 02:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
um that is pretty much my testimony it
 
02:13:50.639 --> 02:13:51.410 align:start position:0%
um that is pretty much my testimony it
is

02:13:51.410 --> 02:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:13:53.870 --> 02:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
um it is a very um it is just a
 
02:13:55.790 --> 02:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
housekeeping measure I reiterate all the
 
02:13:57.430 --> 02:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
points that representative Thomas Made
 
02:13:59.750 --> 02:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
there was a little bit of confusion in
 
02:14:03.589 --> 02:14:03.599 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1270 and House Bill 1258 from
 
02:14:06.530 --> 02:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
last year that include DES in drafting
 
02:14:08.629 --> 02:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
the system benefits charge report this
 
02:14:10.850 --> 02:14:10.860 align:start position:0%
is just to clean up and I'll take any
 
02:14:17.089 --> 02:14:17.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:19.129 --> 02:14:19.139 align:start position:0%
seeing none I thank you very much thank
 
02:14:19.139 --> 02:14:22.129 align:start position:0%
seeing none I thank you very much thank
you

02:14:22.129 --> 02:14:22.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:26.870 --> 02:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
and with no more pink cards in hand
 
02:14:34.310 --> 02:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:36.290 --> 02:14:36.300 align:start position:0%
I will ask is there anybody who would
 
02:14:38.030 --> 02:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
like to speak who has not submitted a
 
02:14:40.250 --> 02:14:40.260 align:start position:0%
pink card
 
02:14:45.850 --> 02:14:45.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:48.770 --> 02:14:48.780 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I did submit a pink card I
 
02:14:50.870 --> 02:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
think it's working its way over but um I
 
02:14:54.770 --> 02:14:54.780 align:start position:0%
will just say that uh uh we uh fully
 
02:14:56.750 --> 02:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
concur with the comments that were
 
02:14:58.970 --> 02:14:58.980 align:start position:0%
provided by the department of energy
 
02:15:02.510 --> 02:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
um and uh Mr Robert's extensive
 
02:15:05.450 --> 02:15:05.460 align:start position:0%
testimony and I we agree this is a
 
02:15:08.569 --> 02:15:08.579 align:start position:0%
housekeeping we requested this we have
 
02:15:11.209 --> 02:15:11.219 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the SBC distribution
 
02:15:14.149 --> 02:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
and again this was just a drafting error
 
02:15:16.069 --> 02:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
so we're we're supportive of the bill as
 
02:15:18.530 --> 02:15:18.540 align:start position:0%
well it was at our request as uh was
 
02:15:20.390 --> 02:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
noted by representative Thomas and we
 
02:15:21.770 --> 02:15:21.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:15:21.780 --> 02:15:22.609 align:start position:0%
thank you

Fitzgerald
 
02:15:28.609 --> 02:15:28.619 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
02:15:31.790 --> 02:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
I will now uh call to the testimony
 
02:15:34.010 --> 02:15:34.020 align:start position:0%
table The Honorable John Mann of
 
02:15:34.020 --> 02:15:35.149 align:start position:0%
table The Honorable John Mann of
allstead

02:15:35.149 --> 02:15:35.159 align:start position:0%
allstead
 
02:15:38.030 --> 02:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
who would like to make a comment or two
 
02:15:40.729 --> 02:15:40.739 align:start position:0%

and let us enjoy it yeah very very
 
02:15:50.930 --> 02:15:50.940 align:start position:0%
simple comment really that oh it seems
 
02:15:55.930 --> 02:15:55.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:59.990 --> 02:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
you turned it off instead of on
 
02:16:01.310 --> 02:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
I think
 
02:16:03.169 --> 02:16:03.179 align:start position:0%
um Energy's efficiency is extremely
 
02:16:04.910 --> 02:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
important for our future
 
02:16:08.209 --> 02:16:08.219 align:start position:0%
and any justification for it any
 
02:16:08.219 --> 02:16:09.950 align:start position:0%
and any justification for it any
supporting

02:16:09.950 --> 02:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
supporting
 
02:16:13.250 --> 02:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
information uh
 
02:16:16.129 --> 02:16:16.139 align:start position:0%
um or guidance information guidance
 
02:16:16.139 --> 02:16:18.010 align:start position:0%
um or guidance information guidance
suggestions

02:16:18.010 --> 02:16:18.020 align:start position:0%
suggestions
 
02:16:21.709 --> 02:16:21.719 align:start position:0%
about Energy Efficiency that are
 
02:16:24.229 --> 02:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
that the department of environment could
 
02:16:26.510 --> 02:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
come up with would be valuable
 
02:16:29.149 --> 02:16:29.159 align:start position:0%
in supporting Energy Efficiency programs
 
02:16:31.250 --> 02:16:31.260 align:start position:0%
finding value for the Energy Efficiency
 
02:16:33.049 --> 02:16:33.059 align:start position:0%
programs and so on
 
02:16:37.190 --> 02:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
so I uh I would go the other way and
 
02:16:39.650 --> 02:16:39.660 align:start position:0%
suggest that they should write some
 
02:16:41.330 --> 02:16:41.340 align:start position:0%
comments about
 
02:16:44.810 --> 02:16:44.820 align:start position:0%
how important or not if they find it
 
02:16:46.669 --> 02:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
that way how important the Energy
 
02:16:49.009 --> 02:16:49.019 align:start position:0%
Efficiency programs could be
 
02:16:55.270 --> 02:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:57.830 --> 02:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
okay that's it thank you and it's nice
 
02:17:00.049 --> 02:17:00.059 align:start position:0%
to see you uh John appreciate you
 
02:17:02.389 --> 02:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
driving over here on this frightfully
 
02:17:03.950 --> 02:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
cold day
 
02:17:06.709 --> 02:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
any questions for The Honorable John
 
02:17:06.719 --> 02:17:09.110 align:start position:0%
any questions for The Honorable John
Mann

02:17:09.110 --> 02:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
Mann
 
02:17:11.089 --> 02:17:11.099 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
02:17:12.709 --> 02:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
we thank you
 
02:17:15.650 --> 02:17:15.660 align:start position:0%
and now with no more pink cards in hand
 
02:17:18.650 --> 02:17:18.660 align:start position:0%
I think it's safe to say that we can
 
02:17:21.049 --> 02:17:21.059 align:start position:0%
officially close the public hearing on
 
02:17:24.009 --> 02:17:24.019 align:start position:0%
House Bill 211 and I'll ask
 
02:17:26.509 --> 02:17:26.519 align:start position:0%
representative closet to give us an
 
02:17:28.669 --> 02:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
indication if there's any blue sheet
 
02:17:32.030 --> 02:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
activity on this bill
 
02:17:36.110 --> 02:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 211 the blue sheet there
 
02:17:39.950 --> 02:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
is one in favor none a pulse
 
02:17:43.490 --> 02:17:43.500 align:start position:0%
I do not have the online
 
02:17:45.349 --> 02:17:45.359 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:17:47.870 --> 02:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
we'll try to maybe get that later
 
02:17:50.629 --> 02:17:50.639 align:start position:0%
I will alert everyone here to the
 
02:17:53.150 --> 02:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
possibility that we will exec this bill
 
02:17:55.790 --> 02:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
at four o'clock when we have executive
 
02:17:55.800 --> 02:17:57.410 align:start position:0%
at four o'clock when we have executive
session

session
 
02:18:00.049 --> 02:18:00.059 align:start position:0%
the ranking member is not here at the
 
02:18:03.889 --> 02:18:03.899 align:start position:0%
moment but if she agrees to executing
 
02:18:06.349 --> 02:18:06.359 align:start position:0%
this bill on the same day house rules
 
02:18:09.530 --> 02:18:09.540 align:start position:0%
will permit that so we will add that to
 
02:18:11.389 --> 02:18:11.399 align:start position:0%
our list of bills to exec at four
 
02:18:11.399 --> 02:18:12.349 align:start position:0%

02:18:18.650 --> 02:18:18.660 align:start position:0%
and with that
 
02:18:21.589 --> 02:18:21.599 align:start position:0%
we will now officially break for lunch
 
02:18:24.530 --> 02:18:24.540 align:start position:0%
so we will be in recess until one
 
02:18:24.540 --> 02:18:25.669 align:start position:0%
so we will be in recess until one

02:18:25.669 --> 02:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
02:18:27.650 --> 02:18:27.660 align:start position:0%
if you decide to go out for lunch make
 
02:18:32.570 --> 02:18:32.580 align:start position:0%
sure you bundle up it's cold out there
 
04:01:50.510 --> 04:01:50.520 align:start position:0%

04:02:39.530 --> 04:02:39.540 align:start position:0%
okay good afternoon everybody welcome
 
04:02:41.750 --> 04:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
back to the afternoon session of science
 
04:02:44.269 --> 04:02:44.279 align:start position:0%
technology and energy for
 
04:02:49.130 --> 04:02:49.140 align:start position:0%
Friday February the 3rd 2003.
 
04:02:51.229 --> 04:02:51.239 align:start position:0%
this afternoon we're going to hear three
 
04:02:53.870 --> 04:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
bills in public hearing
 
04:02:56.410 --> 04:02:56.420 align:start position:0%
HB 633
 
04:03:01.670 --> 04:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
hb-139 and hb219 after which we will
 
04:03:03.950 --> 04:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
enter executive session
 
04:03:06.889 --> 04:03:06.899 align:start position:0%
where we will have an executive session
 
04:03:12.010 --> 04:03:12.020 align:start position:0%
on HB 418 HB 92
 
04:03:19.010 --> 04:03:19.020 align:start position:0%
hb630 HB 234 and HB 246 and possibly
 
04:03:19.020 --> 04:03:22.969 align:start position:0%
hb630 HB 234 and HB 246 and possibly
hb211

04:03:22.969 --> 04:03:22.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:25.610 --> 04:03:25.620 align:start position:0%
so with that I'd like to open the public
 
04:03:28.550 --> 04:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 633 relative to
 
04:03:30.590 --> 04:03:30.600 align:start position:0%
Electric Distribution Company market
 
04:03:33.349 --> 04:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
share prohibiting certain electric rate
 
04:03:36.110 --> 04:03:36.120 align:start position:0%
increases and requiring enforcement
 
04:03:39.349 --> 04:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
against eversource and I will introduce
 
04:03:42.950 --> 04:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
or I will ask to visit the testimony
 
04:03:44.750 --> 04:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
table the prime sponsor of this
 
04:03:46.750 --> 04:03:46.760 align:start position:0%
religious proposed legislation that's
 
04:03:49.250 --> 04:03:49.260 align:start position:0%
representative Horrigan
 
04:03:51.889 --> 04:03:51.899 align:start position:0%
welcome representative
 
04:03:53.570 --> 04:03:53.580 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I'm representative
 
04:03:55.370 --> 04:03:55.380 align:start position:0%
Timothy Horrigan from
 
04:03:57.769 --> 04:03:57.779 align:start position:0%
from Durham and I'll just note uh behind
 
04:03:59.750 --> 04:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
me one of my constituents
 
04:04:02.990 --> 04:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
Mr Hall is here and he won't agree with
 
04:04:05.809 --> 04:04:05.819 align:start position:0%
the bill I'm not sure all those I think
 
04:04:07.309 --> 04:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
maybe a lot of his criticisms are well
 
04:04:10.130 --> 04:04:10.140 align:start position:0%
taken but I think this uh I think just
 
04:04:12.110 --> 04:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
builds a usually useful as a starting
 
04:04:15.050 --> 04:04:15.060 align:start position:0%
off point um get us thinking more about
 
04:04:17.630 --> 04:04:17.640 align:start position:0%
how to uh deal with eversource with the
 
04:04:20.689 --> 04:04:20.699 align:start position:0%
corporate sector in general so
 
04:04:24.110 --> 04:04:24.120 align:start position:0%
um it's a short bill and if passed I
 
04:04:25.189 --> 04:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
think it would have so many drastic
 
04:04:29.269 --> 04:04:29.279 align:start position:0%
consequences in fact I'll be I'm
 
04:04:31.969 --> 04:04:31.979 align:start position:0%
um I have no idea where the 11 votes
 
04:04:33.170 --> 04:04:33.180 align:start position:0%
needed to pass this bill out of
 
04:04:35.349 --> 04:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
committee would come from but if I don't
 
04:04:38.030 --> 04:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
if the bill didn't exist we'd get zero
 
04:04:38.040 --> 04:04:39.170 align:start position:0%
if the bill didn't exist we'd get zero
so

04:04:39.170 --> 04:04:39.180 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:04:40.969 --> 04:04:40.979 align:start position:0%
um I think it some of those are going to
 
04:04:41.929 --> 04:04:41.939 align:start position:0%
be pretty
 
04:04:43.550 --> 04:04:43.560 align:start position:0%
would be pretty wrenching especially for
 
04:04:45.590 --> 04:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
eversource but it's better than the
 
04:04:47.750 --> 04:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
undesirable consequences call drones a
 
04:04:49.309 --> 04:04:49.319 align:start position:0%
year it's over ever sources Monopoly
 
04:04:50.809 --> 04:04:50.819 align:start position:0%
control of the Electric market here in
 
04:04:52.010 --> 04:04:52.020 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:04:53.990 --> 04:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
and by the company Stranglehold over the
 
04:04:55.309 --> 04:04:55.319 align:start position:0%
government institutions which are
 
04:04:57.050 --> 04:04:57.060 align:start position:0%
supposed to regulate that market so for
 
04:04:58.729 --> 04:04:58.739 align:start position:0%
years we've suffered from ever sources
 
04:05:01.070 --> 04:05:01.080 align:start position:0%
high prices and mediocre service and as
 
04:05:02.349 --> 04:05:02.359 align:start position:0%
well as uh
 
04:05:04.550 --> 04:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
at least a certain amount of it's
 
04:05:06.590 --> 04:05:06.600 align:start position:0%
continued obstruction of development of
 
04:05:08.630 --> 04:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
renewable and sustainable energy and
 
04:05:10.790 --> 04:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
just last year the research Got Away
 
04:05:13.910 --> 04:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
doubling the price of electricity and uh
 
04:05:16.070 --> 04:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
my opinion I'm not sure what whether
 
04:05:17.510 --> 04:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
there was a good reason for that even
 
04:05:19.790 --> 04:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
though we understand uh
 
04:05:21.410 --> 04:05:21.420 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to understand we're a small
 
04:05:23.750 --> 04:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
part of a regional uh Electric
 
04:05:26.269 --> 04:05:26.279 align:start position:0%
market and we are part of iso and
 
04:05:27.290 --> 04:05:27.300 align:start position:0%
everything at least we're still part of
 
04:05:28.790 --> 04:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
iso I don't think you've passed that
 
04:05:31.210 --> 04:05:31.220 align:start position:0%
bill pulling out yet so
 
04:05:33.290 --> 04:05:33.300 align:start position:0%
proposed and spill are certainly doable
 
04:05:36.170 --> 04:05:36.180 align:start position:0%
we have the power to to do them even if
 
04:05:37.790 --> 04:05:37.800 align:start position:0%
this bill passes the law exactly is
 
04:05:39.229 --> 04:05:39.239 align:start position:0%
introduced and I'm not sure if that's
 
04:05:41.269 --> 04:05:41.279 align:start position:0%
going to happen I was actually surprised
 
04:05:44.030 --> 04:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
it was just a short and simple bill but
 
04:05:46.790 --> 04:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
um because I had a proposal that
 
04:05:49.849 --> 04:05:49.859 align:start position:0%
a colleague got from one of his
 
04:05:51.290 --> 04:05:51.300 align:start position:0%
constituents and actually that colleague
 
04:05:53.150 --> 04:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
ended up not being on the Masthead of
 
04:05:54.530 --> 04:05:54.540 align:start position:0%
the bill but um
 
04:05:56.210 --> 04:05:56.220 align:start position:0%
and I was surprised the drafter just
 
04:05:58.250 --> 04:05:58.260 align:start position:0%
drafted it pretty much as we presented
 
04:05:59.570 --> 04:05:59.580 align:start position:0%
it to them of course that particular
 
04:06:02.210 --> 04:06:02.220 align:start position:0%
drafter he was an excellent attorney but
 
04:06:05.030 --> 04:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
it's I I will note for whatever it's
 
04:06:07.250 --> 04:06:07.260 align:start position:0%
worth he retired about three weeks he
 
04:06:09.469 --> 04:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
tired about a month after uh drafting
 
04:06:11.090 --> 04:06:11.100 align:start position:0%
this bill but he was a very good
 
04:06:12.950 --> 04:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
drafting attorney so
 
04:06:15.650 --> 04:06:15.660 align:start position:0%
and uh so the Public Utility Commission
 
04:06:17.330 --> 04:06:17.340 align:start position:0%
the primary energy already have the
 
04:06:20.750 --> 04:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
power to Peg electric rate increases or
 
04:06:22.969 --> 04:06:22.979 align:start position:0%
the rate of inflation
 
04:06:24.769 --> 04:06:24.779 align:start position:0%
I mean I even I'll admit that's
 
04:06:27.050 --> 04:06:27.060 align:start position:0%
problematic is like the Consumer Price
 
04:06:28.969 --> 04:06:28.979 align:start position:0%
Index doesn't necessarily track what the
 
04:06:30.590 --> 04:06:30.600 align:start position:0%
cost of producing Distributing
 
04:06:33.110 --> 04:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
electricity but they already have the
 
04:06:35.330 --> 04:06:35.340 align:start position:0%
power to do that the Justice power
 
04:06:36.710 --> 04:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
already has the power to break up
 
04:06:38.570 --> 04:06:38.580 align:start position:0%
monopolies such as eversource and I'm
 
04:06:40.010 --> 04:06:40.020 align:start position:0%
not saying either those tasks are easy
 
04:06:40.020 --> 04:06:40.969 align:start position:0%
not saying either those tasks are easy
like

04:06:40.969 --> 04:06:40.979 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:06:43.010 --> 04:06:43.020 align:start position:0%
like I said if I get 11 votes in this
 
04:06:45.229 --> 04:06:45.239 align:start position:0%
committee I'll be as amazed as anybody
 
04:06:47.570 --> 04:06:47.580 align:start position:0%
else but I might as well try
 
04:06:50.210 --> 04:06:50.220 align:start position:0%
the there's many many fine details that
 
04:06:52.010 --> 04:06:52.020 align:start position:0%
the various executive branch agencies
 
04:06:53.929 --> 04:06:53.939 align:start position:0%
will have to work out but it can be done
 
04:06:56.929 --> 04:06:56.939 align:start position:0%
and it could be done and I I'm an Ever
 
04:06:58.969 --> 04:06:58.979 align:start position:0%
Source customer myself I appreciate the
 
04:07:02.269 --> 04:07:02.279 align:start position:0%
service they provide me as especially uh
 
04:07:04.910 --> 04:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
especially today when it's we're finally
 
04:07:07.429 --> 04:07:07.439 align:start position:0%
getting some cold weather but if dill
 
04:07:10.670 --> 04:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
passes or something or something based
 
04:07:11.450 --> 04:07:11.460 align:start position:0%
on it
 
04:07:13.309 --> 04:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
um I'm one of hundreds of thousands of
 
04:07:14.689 --> 04:07:14.699 align:start position:0%
grand estate or should be paying what I
 
04:07:16.849 --> 04:07:16.859 align:start position:0%
think is a much fairer price for this
 
04:07:19.729 --> 04:07:19.739 align:start position:0%
essential service so uh
 
04:07:22.550 --> 04:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to go ahead and urge you to
 
04:07:25.189 --> 04:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on HB 633 it's uh your
 
04:07:26.630 --> 04:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
bill it's in your possession now you're
 
04:07:29.269 --> 04:07:29.279 align:start position:0%
certainly uh free to uh free to amend it
 
04:07:30.769 --> 04:07:30.779 align:start position:0%
and I uh
 
04:07:33.290 --> 04:07:33.300 align:start position:0%
I would not be I would not be surprised
 
04:07:35.269 --> 04:07:35.279 align:start position:0%
if it ends up being various uh
 
04:07:37.370 --> 04:07:37.380 align:start position:0%
effectively amended should you choose to
 
04:07:40.070 --> 04:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
go forward with it so uh
 
04:07:42.170 --> 04:07:42.180 align:start position:0%
that said I guess I can quickly take any
 
04:07:43.429 --> 04:07:43.439 align:start position:0%
questions although I haven't had my
 
04:07:44.870 --> 04:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
lunch yet and I have another bill coming
 
04:07:46.490 --> 04:07:46.500 align:start position:0%
up pretty soon but you're welcome to ask
 
04:07:48.590 --> 04:07:48.600 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
04:07:50.570 --> 04:07:50.580 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for introducing
 
04:07:52.309 --> 04:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
this legislation before you leave the
 
04:07:53.870 --> 04:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
room would you submit a pin card of
 
04:07:55.570 --> 04:07:55.580 align:start position:0%
course yes
 
04:07:58.010 --> 04:07:58.020 align:start position:0%
haven't haven't written anything on it
 
04:07:59.689 --> 04:07:59.699 align:start position:0%
but I will do so of course thank you
 
04:08:01.670 --> 04:08:01.680 align:start position:0%

committee for the prime sponsor of this
 
04:08:07.610 --> 04:08:07.620 align:start position:0%

04:08:12.050 --> 04:08:12.060 align:start position:0%
um thank you for being here
 
04:08:15.110 --> 04:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
representative we've been hearing from
 
04:08:15.120 --> 04:08:15.950 align:start position:0%
representative we've been hearing from
um

04:08:15.950 --> 04:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:18.889 --> 04:08:18.899 align:start position:0%
other agencies and and other Bill
 
04:08:21.950 --> 04:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
sponsors that world events play into
 
04:08:23.809 --> 04:08:23.819 align:start position:0%
higher prices
 
04:08:26.210 --> 04:08:26.220 align:start position:0%
um so how would world events fit into
 
04:08:27.769 --> 04:08:27.779 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:08:29.990 --> 04:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
well if you pass it exactly it is the
 
04:08:32.510 --> 04:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
world events Energy prices are already
 
04:08:35.210 --> 04:08:35.220 align:start position:0%
Afflicted to CPI I mean I think
 
04:08:37.309 --> 04:08:37.319 align:start position:0%
that's uh that's certainly true
 
04:08:39.170 --> 04:08:39.180 align:start position:0%
especially the uh
 
04:08:41.689 --> 04:08:41.699 align:start position:0%
conflict in the Ukraine that's been
 
04:08:44.210 --> 04:08:44.220 align:start position:0%
going on for a year that's uh
 
04:08:46.309 --> 04:08:46.319 align:start position:0%
that's going to continue to increase
 
04:08:48.889 --> 04:08:48.899 align:start position:0%
energy prices and I think that's the
 
04:08:50.150 --> 04:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
outbreak of that war is one of many
 
04:08:51.349 --> 04:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
reasons they're never going to go down
 
04:08:53.990 --> 04:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
as low as they were in the uh you know
 
04:08:56.510 --> 04:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
in the during the during the pandemic
 
04:08:58.729 --> 04:08:58.739 align:start position:0%
years but um you know
 
04:09:01.309 --> 04:09:01.319 align:start position:0%
but as I guess but as I said still I
 
04:09:03.170 --> 04:09:03.180 align:start position:0%
think this is a this is something
 
04:09:05.269 --> 04:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
similar to it is a better idea than just
 
04:09:06.710 --> 04:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
sort of the free-for-all we have now
 
04:09:09.170 --> 04:09:09.180 align:start position:0%
we're pretty much the electric companies
 
04:09:11.210 --> 04:09:11.220 align:start position:0%
uh just I think just set their own
 
04:09:14.150 --> 04:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
prices uh basically so thank you thank
 
04:09:14.160 --> 04:09:20.990 align:start position:0%
prices uh basically so thank you thank
you

04:09:20.990 --> 04:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:22.729 --> 04:09:22.739 align:start position:0%
well seeing no further questions from
 
04:09:24.170 --> 04:09:24.180 align:start position:0%
the committee I want to thank you for
 
04:09:26.750 --> 04:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
introducing this legislation I urge you
 
04:09:29.210 --> 04:09:29.220 align:start position:0%
to submit your pink card before you head
 
04:09:31.429 --> 04:09:31.439 align:start position:0%
for lunch yeah and good luck with your
 
04:09:33.410 --> 04:09:33.420 align:start position:0%
next bill introduction enjoy working
 
04:09:36.290 --> 04:09:36.300 align:start position:0%
with it enjoy working on it so like if I
 
04:09:37.790 --> 04:09:37.800 align:start position:0%
think there's a lot of good I think
 
04:09:39.830 --> 04:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
there's a I think I think something good
 
04:09:41.450 --> 04:09:41.460 align:start position:0%
will come out of this okay thank you
 
04:09:44.150 --> 04:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
very much I'd next like to call to the
 
04:09:46.070 --> 04:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
front of the room the representative
 
04:09:48.530 --> 04:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
from the Department of energy Mr Griffin
 
04:09:48.540 --> 04:10:03.490 align:start position:0%
from the Department of energy Mr Griffin
Roberge

04:10:03.490 --> 04:10:03.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:06.469 --> 04:10:06.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh Griffin robbery
 
04:10:08.570 --> 04:10:08.580 align:start position:0%
uh State energy program manager at the
 
04:10:10.849 --> 04:10:10.859 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of energy the
 
04:10:12.950 --> 04:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
department is opposed to this bill as
 
04:10:15.410 --> 04:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
introduced department has significant
 
04:10:17.750 --> 04:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
economic and legal concerns with the
 
04:10:19.689 --> 04:10:19.699 align:start position:0%
bill as it's currently written
 
04:10:22.729 --> 04:10:22.739 align:start position:0%
to provide some context to the committee
 
04:10:24.530 --> 04:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's electric distribution
 
04:10:29.150 --> 04:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
utilities as part of RSA 374f that's the
 
04:10:32.030 --> 04:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
electric restructuring statute do not
 
04:10:34.670 --> 04:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
own generating assets or the resources
 
04:10:38.090 --> 04:10:38.100 align:start position:0%
to produce electric power for the energy
 
04:10:41.210 --> 04:10:41.220 align:start position:0%
sold to customers through
 
04:10:42.830 --> 04:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
um default service those utilities
 
04:10:45.170 --> 04:10:45.180 align:start position:0%
competitively solicit prices from
 
04:10:47.210 --> 04:10:47.220 align:start position:0%
Regional generators for electric power
 
04:10:49.610 --> 04:10:49.620 align:start position:0%
on the wholesale Market again through a
 
04:10:53.450 --> 04:10:53.460 align:start position:0%
competitive solicitation the prices that
 
04:10:55.670 --> 04:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
are received through that solicitation
 
04:10:57.769 --> 04:10:57.779 align:start position:0%
reflect Wholesale Electric market
 
04:11:00.229 --> 04:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
conditions and Electric utilities do not
 
04:11:03.229 --> 04:11:03.239 align:start position:0%
make any profit from the sale of default
 
04:11:05.330 --> 04:11:05.340 align:start position:0%
service what's important to know is that
 
04:11:07.729 --> 04:11:07.739 align:start position:0%
the cost of default Energy service or
 
04:11:09.530 --> 04:11:09.540 align:start position:0%
the cost of the power procured by the
 
04:11:12.769 --> 04:11:12.779 align:start position:0%
utilities is directly passed through to
 
04:11:15.889 --> 04:11:15.899 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's electric consumers as I
 
04:11:17.809 --> 04:11:17.819 align:start position:0%
stated electric utilities do not make
 
04:11:19.910 --> 04:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
any return rate of return on those power
 
04:11:21.650 --> 04:11:21.660 align:start position:0%
costs but they do make a rate of return
 
04:11:24.229 --> 04:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
on the resources needed to distribute
 
04:11:27.490 --> 04:11:27.500 align:start position:0%
and transmit that power to customers
 
04:11:30.050 --> 04:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
once these solicitations conclude the
 
04:11:31.189 --> 04:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Public Utilities
 
04:11:33.830 --> 04:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
Commission then conducts an adjudicative
 
04:11:35.630 --> 04:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
proceeding to determine the utilities
 
04:11:39.410 --> 04:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
electric rates this adjudication ensures
 
04:11:41.630 --> 04:11:41.640 align:start position:0%
that the costs recover by the utilities
 
04:11:44.809 --> 04:11:44.819 align:start position:0%
are prudently incurred and are are are
 
04:11:48.410 --> 04:11:48.420 align:start position:0%
just fair and reasonable these terms
 
04:11:50.929 --> 04:11:50.939 align:start position:0%
prudently incurred fair just and
 
04:11:53.809 --> 04:11:53.819 align:start position:0%
reasonable are important as they are
 
04:11:56.150 --> 04:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
significant legal terms that have been
 
04:11:58.370 --> 04:11:58.380 align:start position:0%
built upon many years of legal precedent
 
04:12:00.830 --> 04:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
these terms are the basis by which the
 
04:12:02.990 --> 04:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
puc and other state regulators and other
 
04:12:05.570 --> 04:12:05.580 align:start position:0%
states approve electric rates and the
 
04:12:07.309 --> 04:12:07.319 align:start position:0%
utilities rate of return on their
 
04:12:07.319 --> 04:12:08.750 align:start position:0%
utilities rate of return on their
Investments

04:12:08.750 --> 04:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
Investments
 
04:12:11.750 --> 04:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
um as I recall Tom Frantz our director
 
04:12:13.670 --> 04:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
of regulatory support was here and
 
04:12:15.229 --> 04:12:15.239 align:start position:0%
testified to the committee during our
 
04:12:16.849 --> 04:12:16.859 align:start position:0%
other Department's presentations that
 
04:12:19.010 --> 04:12:19.020 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire typically has an eight and
 
04:12:20.809 --> 04:12:20.819 align:start position:0%
a half to a nine and a half percent
 
04:12:22.969 --> 04:12:22.979 align:start position:0%
return on equity for public utilities
 
04:12:25.370 --> 04:12:25.380 align:start position:0%
which tends to be in the middle to lower
 
04:12:27.830 --> 04:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
portion of what other states typically
 
04:12:29.330 --> 04:12:29.340 align:start position:0%
offer as a rate of return to their
 
04:12:29.340 --> 04:12:30.490 align:start position:0%
offer as a rate of return to their
utilities

04:12:30.490 --> 04:12:30.500 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
04:12:33.469 --> 04:12:33.479 align:start position:0%
looking specifically at the bill section
 
04:12:35.090 --> 04:12:35.100 align:start position:0%
two of the bill requires that no
 
04:12:36.650 --> 04:12:36.660 align:start position:0%
electric distribution utility in New
 
04:12:38.630 --> 04:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire shall be permitted to raise
 
04:12:41.510 --> 04:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
its electric rates to customers by an
 
04:12:43.309 --> 04:12:43.319 align:start position:0%
amount that exceeds the annual increase
 
04:12:46.490 --> 04:12:46.500 align:start position:0%
in the Consumer Price Index put simply
 
04:12:48.229 --> 04:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
this provision results in an
 
04:12:50.090 --> 04:12:50.100 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional taking from Public
 
04:12:52.610 --> 04:12:52.620 align:start position:0%
Utilities by way of background Public
 
04:12:54.229 --> 04:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
Utilities offer a good that is
 
04:12:56.570 --> 04:12:56.580 align:start position:0%
considered a public service that's the
 
04:12:59.150 --> 04:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
availability of electricity costs for
 
04:13:01.309 --> 04:13:01.319 align:start position:0%
utilities may go up to provide that
 
04:13:03.469 --> 04:13:03.479 align:start position:0%
service but this bill would prohibit
 
04:13:05.510 --> 04:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
them from recovering the cost to provide
 
04:13:07.250 --> 04:13:07.260 align:start position:0%
that adequate electric service so for
 
04:13:10.849 --> 04:13:10.859 align:start position:0%
example if in a year until these costs
 
04:13:12.950 --> 04:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
go up six percent but they're only
 
04:13:15.950 --> 04:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
prohibited from uh from getting a rate
 
04:13:17.269 --> 04:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
of return of three percent because of
 
04:13:19.429 --> 04:13:19.439 align:start position:0%
the Consumer Price Index they are out
 
04:13:22.070 --> 04:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
three percent uh for an adequate rate of
 
04:13:23.990 --> 04:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
return that in itself is an
 
04:13:25.729 --> 04:13:25.739 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional taking under the under
 
04:13:27.590 --> 04:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
the Constitution
 
04:13:29.630 --> 04:13:29.640 align:start position:0%
um restricting the ability of utilities
 
04:13:32.210 --> 04:13:32.220 align:start position:0%
to recover their costs will also likely
 
04:13:34.550 --> 04:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
impact default service solicitations and
 
04:13:36.410 --> 04:13:36.420 align:start position:0%
run the risk of failed default service
 
04:13:39.050 --> 04:13:39.060 align:start position:0%
auctions leading to increased costs to
 
04:13:41.689 --> 04:13:41.699 align:start position:0%
rate payers uh simply put public utility
 
04:13:43.729 --> 04:13:43.739 align:start position:0%
rates are based on cost of service
 
04:13:45.950 --> 04:13:45.960 align:start position:0%
regulation and this language would
 
04:13:47.570 --> 04:13:47.580 align:start position:0%
likely run afoul of legal precedent
 
04:13:49.910 --> 04:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
established in long-standing U.S Supreme
 
04:13:51.950 --> 04:13:51.960 align:start position:0%
Court cases
 
04:13:51.960 --> 04:13:52.790 align:start position:0%
Court cases
um

04:13:52.790 --> 04:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:55.130 --> 04:13:55.140 align:start position:0%
section three of the bill requires that
 
04:13:57.229 --> 04:13:57.239 align:start position:0%
no utility shall be permitted to have
 
04:13:59.330 --> 04:13:59.340 align:start position:0%
more than 50 percent of the market share
 
04:14:02.210 --> 04:14:02.220 align:start position:0%
in the state the thrust of this language
 
04:14:05.450 --> 04:14:05.460 align:start position:0%
uh in the Department's eyes seems to
 
04:14:07.250 --> 04:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
encourage competition amongst electric
 
04:14:10.070 --> 04:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
distribution utilities by way of con by
 
04:14:12.170 --> 04:14:12.180 align:start position:0%
way of background this was largely the
 
04:14:14.510 --> 04:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
landscape of electrical markets back in
 
04:14:17.630 --> 04:14:17.640 align:start position:0%
the early 1900s and if anyone needs a
 
04:14:19.070 --> 04:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
refresher on what that looks like that's
 
04:14:21.889 --> 04:14:21.899 align:start position:0%
where you had independent utilities
 
04:14:23.870 --> 04:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
everybody has their own infrastructure
 
04:14:26.689 --> 04:14:26.699 align:start position:0%
you have 16 or 17 different poles and
 
04:14:28.610 --> 04:14:28.620 align:start position:0%
wires going down the road going down the
 
04:14:31.550 --> 04:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
same road so this bill could potentially
 
04:14:35.510 --> 04:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
return to that again that landscape was
 
04:14:37.130 --> 04:14:37.140 align:start position:0%
when multiple utilities existed and
 
04:14:38.510 --> 04:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
again when companies owned their old
 
04:14:41.090 --> 04:14:41.100 align:start position:0%
pose of wires and if there is a return
 
04:14:43.189 --> 04:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
to that there are significant legal and
 
04:14:45.650 --> 04:14:45.660 align:start position:0%
economic and safety implications if that
 
04:14:47.950 --> 04:14:47.960 align:start position:0%
if this language were to move forward
 
04:14:50.269 --> 04:14:50.279 align:start position:0%
today's distribution utilities are
 
04:14:52.309 --> 04:14:52.319 align:start position:0%
regulated natural monopolies that
 
04:14:53.929 --> 04:14:53.939 align:start position:0%
control their own service territories
 
04:14:55.969 --> 04:14:55.979 align:start position:0%
around the state I believe the committee
 
04:14:57.830 --> 04:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
saw the puc's testimony earlier today
 
04:14:57.840 --> 04:14:58.790 align:start position:0%
saw the puc's testimony earlier today
about

04:14:58.790 --> 04:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:15:02.389 --> 04:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
uh franchise territories those living in
 
04:15:04.490 --> 04:15:04.500 align:start position:0%
a utility service territory get their
 
04:15:05.929 --> 04:15:05.939 align:start position:0%
default service from that utility
 
04:15:08.290 --> 04:15:08.300 align:start position:0%
whether it be eversource unitel Liberty
 
04:15:10.790 --> 04:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
competition still does exist to some
 
04:15:13.429 --> 04:15:13.439 align:start position:0%
degree consumers are obviously allowed
 
04:15:16.429 --> 04:15:16.439 align:start position:0%
to seek out competitive Electric Supply
 
04:15:18.290 --> 04:15:18.300 align:start position:0%
um to shop around and find more
 
04:15:20.809 --> 04:15:20.819 align:start position:0%
attractive electric rates the actual
 
04:15:22.910 --> 04:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
distribution of that power though is a
 
04:15:25.510 --> 04:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
regulated Monopoly service
 
04:15:27.769 --> 04:15:27.779 align:start position:0%
additionally the language in Section 3
 
04:15:29.570 --> 04:15:29.580 align:start position:0%
is quite broad as it doesn't make any
 
04:15:31.130 --> 04:15:31.140 align:start position:0%
mention as to how market share is
 
04:15:33.769 --> 04:15:33.779 align:start position:0%
defined is that based on annual electric
 
04:15:36.110 --> 04:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
electric sales is it based on the size
 
04:15:37.910 --> 04:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
of a utility service territories that
 
04:15:39.670 --> 04:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
are owned in the state
 
04:15:43.010 --> 04:15:43.020 align:start position:0%
these are just at least um the concerns
 
04:15:44.389 --> 04:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
that the department has identified with
 
04:15:46.729 --> 04:15:46.739 align:start position:0%
this bill and that uh concludes my
 
04:15:48.110 --> 04:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
testimony and I'm happy to take any
 
04:15:48.120 --> 04:15:50.570 align:start position:0%
testimony and I'm happy to take any
questions

04:15:50.570 --> 04:15:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:53.030 --> 04:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Roberts representative
 
04:15:54.710 --> 04:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
notter has a question
 
04:15:56.809 --> 04:15:56.819 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman it's a two-part
 
04:16:00.469 --> 04:16:00.479 align:start position:0%
question one will you be sending us
 
04:16:02.689 --> 04:16:02.699 align:start position:0%
um your testimony and can you please
 
04:16:05.889 --> 04:16:05.899 align:start position:0%
repeat the part that you said about the
 
04:16:08.689 --> 04:16:08.699 align:start position:0%
unconstitutionality of this bill sure so
 
04:16:10.490 --> 04:16:10.500 align:start position:0%
uh I can these are just talking points
 
04:16:11.750 --> 04:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
I've written up for myself but I can
 
04:16:12.950 --> 04:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
certainly put them in an email and send
 
04:16:14.750 --> 04:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
it to the committee later
 
04:16:17.150 --> 04:16:17.160 align:start position:0%
um regarding the unconstitutionality of
 
04:16:18.710 --> 04:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
the bill that's largely focused on
 
04:16:20.990 --> 04:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
section two of the bill
 
04:16:23.389 --> 04:16:23.399 align:start position:0%
um again the
 
04:16:26.330 --> 04:16:26.340 align:start position:0%
cell this public utilities offer the
 
04:16:27.769 --> 04:16:27.779 align:start position:0%
availability of electricity which is
 
04:16:31.309 --> 04:16:31.319 align:start position:0%
deemed a public service they are allowed
 
04:16:33.229 --> 04:16:33.239 align:start position:0%
to recover costs they're prudently
 
04:16:36.170 --> 04:16:36.180 align:start position:0%
incurred at just fair and reasonable
 
04:16:39.769 --> 04:16:39.779 align:start position:0%
rates the bill as its proposed indicates
 
04:16:41.689 --> 04:16:41.699 align:start position:0%
that their own utilities are only
 
04:16:44.689 --> 04:16:44.699 align:start position:0%
allowed every return up to the max of
 
04:16:49.269 --> 04:16:49.279 align:start position:0%
the annual CPI if a utilities costs
 
04:16:51.710 --> 04:16:51.720 align:start position:0%
incurred go up say six percent they
 
04:16:53.929 --> 04:16:53.939 align:start position:0%
cannot recover any anything more than
 
04:16:55.729 --> 04:16:55.739 align:start position:0%
what is established in the CPI of that
 
04:16:55.739 --> 04:16:58.849 align:start position:0%
what is established in the CPI of that
year

04:16:58.849 --> 04:16:58.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:01.309 --> 04:17:01.319 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question
 
04:17:03.290 --> 04:17:03.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
 
04:17:06.229 --> 04:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
Roberts for taking my question so when
 
04:17:08.150 --> 04:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
you were talking about eversource uh
 
04:17:11.210 --> 04:17:11.220 align:start position:0%
being potentially broken up uh you you
 
04:17:13.070 --> 04:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
brought us back to the situation a
 
04:17:15.110 --> 04:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
hundred years ago would it be possible
 
04:17:17.689 --> 04:17:17.699 align:start position:0%
to break up ever Source into
 
04:17:20.750 --> 04:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
fewer pieces than than the hundreds that
 
04:17:22.790 --> 04:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
that might have been you know maybe two
 
04:17:25.250 --> 04:17:25.260 align:start position:0%
or three pieces thank you for the
 
04:17:27.410 --> 04:17:27.420 align:start position:0%
question I mean I imagine you might but
 
04:17:27.420 --> 04:17:28.490 align:start position:0%
question I mean I imagine you might but
again

04:17:28.490 --> 04:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:17:30.050 --> 04:17:30.060 align:start position:0%
um you
 
04:17:32.269 --> 04:17:32.279 align:start position:0%
you'd run signal you'd run into some
 
04:17:34.250 --> 04:17:34.260 align:start position:0%
significant constitutional and economic
 
04:17:36.290 --> 04:17:36.300 align:start position:0%
concerns with that and that it is their
 
04:17:38.030 --> 04:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
infrastructure they'll likely need to be
 
04:17:40.670 --> 04:17:40.680 align:start position:0%
a reimbursement for their infrastructure
 
04:17:44.870 --> 04:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:46.849 --> 04:17:46.859 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
04:17:46.859 --> 04:17:47.750 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
question

04:17:47.750 --> 04:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:17:49.250 --> 04:17:49.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:17:51.229 --> 04:17:51.239 align:start position:0%
um this is just a clarification question
 
04:17:52.370 --> 04:17:52.380 align:start position:0%
I guess
 
04:17:54.170 --> 04:17:54.180 align:start position:0%
um this is the second Bill where the
 
04:17:57.469 --> 04:17:57.479 align:start position:0%
fiscal note has not been attached
 
04:17:59.630 --> 04:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
um and it says due to time constraints
 
04:18:01.250 --> 04:18:01.260 align:start position:0%
the office of legislative budget
 
04:18:04.429 --> 04:18:04.439 align:start position:0%
assistant does is the doe holding up any
 
04:18:06.469 --> 04:18:06.479 align:start position:0%
of these fiscal notes in any way I do
 
04:18:08.090 --> 04:18:08.100 align:start position:0%
not know that but I can certainly uh
 
04:18:09.229 --> 04:18:09.239 align:start position:0%
well first off thank you for the
 
04:18:10.550 --> 04:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
question but I can certainly look into
 
04:18:11.990 --> 04:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
that and follow back up with the
 
04:18:14.210 --> 04:18:14.220 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much
 
04:18:16.849 --> 04:18:16.859 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question
 
04:18:18.469 --> 04:18:18.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:18:20.090 --> 04:18:20.100 align:start position:0%
coming in again
 
04:18:20.100 --> 04:18:21.650 align:start position:0%
coming in again
um

04:18:21.650 --> 04:18:21.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:25.130 --> 04:18:25.140 align:start position:0%
businesses lose money all the time
 
04:18:28.790 --> 04:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
um and and suggesting that um
 
04:18:28.800 --> 04:18:30.349 align:start position:0%
um and and suggesting that um
the

04:18:30.349 --> 04:18:30.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:18:33.229 --> 04:18:33.239 align:start position:0%
um you that that if the if the if the
 
04:18:36.050 --> 04:18:36.060 align:start position:0%
utility lost money because of this
 
04:18:36.060 --> 04:18:37.070 align:start position:0%
utility lost money because of this
action

04:18:37.070 --> 04:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
action
 
04:18:39.590 --> 04:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
is an unconstitutional taking of
 
04:18:42.889 --> 04:18:42.899 align:start position:0%
property that's a pretty significant
 
04:18:42.899 --> 04:18:43.910 align:start position:0%
property that's a pretty significant
um

04:18:43.910 --> 04:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:45.889 --> 04:18:45.899 align:start position:0%
claim I mean is there precedent for that
 
04:18:48.410 --> 04:18:48.420 align:start position:0%
yes so first off thank you for the
 
04:18:48.420 --> 04:18:49.490 align:start position:0%
yes so first off thank you for the
question

04:18:49.490 --> 04:18:49.500 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:18:51.950 --> 04:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
um under you know there's various uh
 
04:18:54.530 --> 04:18:54.540 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court cases uh going back to the
 
04:18:57.650 --> 04:18:57.660 align:start position:0%
1920s and the 1940s that really uh
 
04:18:59.570 --> 04:18:59.580 align:start position:0%
established that regulated utilities
 
04:19:01.670 --> 04:19:01.680 align:start position:0%
such as those operating in New Hampshire
 
04:19:03.950 --> 04:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
today are entitled to a fair and
 
04:19:05.570 --> 04:19:05.580 align:start position:0%
reasonable rate of return on their
 
04:19:07.790 --> 04:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
Capital Investments to deliver electric
 
04:19:10.370 --> 04:19:10.380 align:start position:0%
service to customers in the state
 
04:19:12.950 --> 04:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
um those are I can certainly provide
 
04:19:14.809 --> 04:19:14.819 align:start position:0%
cases in an email
 
04:19:16.729 --> 04:19:16.739 align:start position:0%
um I'll be quite honest quite long
 
04:19:19.010 --> 04:19:19.020 align:start position:0%
titles but um I can certainly follow up
 
04:19:20.630 --> 04:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
with the committee with reference to
 
04:19:22.849 --> 04:19:22.859 align:start position:0%
those cases if that's helpful
 
04:19:25.429 --> 04:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
 
04:19:25.439 --> 04:19:28.130 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
um

04:19:28.130 --> 04:19:28.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:30.110 --> 04:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
but I guess what I what I'm what I'm
 
04:19:32.210 --> 04:19:32.220 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying is that if this if this
 
04:19:34.269 --> 04:19:34.279 align:start position:0%
bill passed
 
04:19:38.750 --> 04:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
the the state would be setting what that
 
04:19:42.590 --> 04:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
fair level of return would be correct
 
04:19:45.229 --> 04:19:45.239 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:19:47.389 --> 04:19:47.399 align:start position:0%
you know that how can that then be
 
04:19:48.849 --> 04:19:48.859 align:start position:0%
enough how could there then be an
 
04:19:50.809 --> 04:19:50.819 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional taking of property
 
04:19:52.429 --> 04:19:52.439 align:start position:0%
thank you and if the rate's been
 
04:19:55.370 --> 04:19:55.380 align:start position:0%
determined so
 
04:19:57.950 --> 04:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
under under these various cases and I'm
 
04:20:00.410 --> 04:20:00.420 align:start position:0%
certainly no attorney I can I I can feel
 
04:20:02.330 --> 04:20:02.340 align:start position:0%
him right over my shoulder Don creases I
 
04:20:03.530 --> 04:20:03.540 align:start position:0%
know I'm going to answer this when he
 
04:20:06.530 --> 04:20:06.540 align:start position:0%
gets up here but um what was it
 
04:20:08.570 --> 04:20:08.580 align:start position:0%
um as I mentioned regulated utilities
 
04:20:10.189 --> 04:20:10.199 align:start position:0%
are entitled to a reasonable opportunity
 
04:20:11.990 --> 04:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
to recover their prudently incurred
 
04:20:13.910 --> 04:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
costs that is vetted through puc
 
04:20:16.370 --> 04:20:16.380 align:start position:0%
adjudications through whether it be
 
04:20:19.550 --> 04:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
puc's here or similar processes in other
 
04:20:19.560 --> 04:20:21.110 align:start position:0%
puc's here or similar processes in other
states

04:20:21.110 --> 04:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
states
 
04:20:23.750 --> 04:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
um they are entitled to prudently incur
 
04:20:26.269 --> 04:20:26.279 align:start position:0%
uh recover those costs that they
 
04:20:28.130 --> 04:20:28.140 align:start position:0%
incurred if the state then comes in and
 
04:20:30.530 --> 04:20:30.540 align:start position:0%
says nope you're only established this
 
04:20:32.210 --> 04:20:32.220 align:start position:0%
amount no more through any type of
 
04:20:34.610 --> 04:20:34.620 align:start position:0%
adjudicative process that is determined
 
04:20:36.229 --> 04:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
to be an unconstitutional under uh
 
04:20:36.239 --> 04:20:39.050 align:start position:0%
to be an unconstitutional under uh
taking

04:20:39.050 --> 04:20:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:41.150 --> 04:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:20:43.070 --> 04:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no more questions from the
 
04:20:44.510 --> 04:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
committee I want to thank you for
 
04:20:46.429 --> 04:20:46.439 align:start position:0%
justifying the gifts bill
 
04:20:48.590 --> 04:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
and I will call next to the front of the
 
04:20:48.600 --> 04:20:50.090 align:start position:0%
and I will call next to the front of the
room

04:20:50.090 --> 04:20:50.100 align:start position:0%
room
 
04:20:53.689 --> 04:20:53.699 align:start position:0%

04:20:55.490 --> 04:20:55.500 align:start position:0%
who's requested four minutes and he
 
04:21:08.269 --> 04:21:08.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:11.090 --> 04:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
good afternoon uh
 
04:21:13.429 --> 04:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
Michael Licata representing eversource
 
04:21:15.530 --> 04:21:15.540 align:start position:0%
energy thank you for the opportunity to
 
04:21:17.990 --> 04:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
testify before you today
 
04:21:20.650 --> 04:21:20.660 align:start position:0%
um I'll keep my comments uh
 
04:21:23.990 --> 04:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
fairly focused uh and and brief I think
 
04:21:26.990 --> 04:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
Mr Roberts covered many of the points
 
04:21:29.570 --> 04:21:29.580 align:start position:0%
that I was going to but I did want to
 
04:21:31.670 --> 04:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
emphasize a few
 
04:21:35.269 --> 04:21:35.279 align:start position:0%
um a few key factors so
 
04:21:37.790 --> 04:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
by way a background again eversource
 
04:21:39.910 --> 04:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
energy provides electric distribution
 
04:21:44.870 --> 04:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
service to over 400 excuse me 540 000
 
04:21:46.550 --> 04:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
homes and businesses throughout the
 
04:21:49.370 --> 04:21:49.380 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and on behalf of
 
04:21:53.090 --> 04:21:53.100 align:start position:0%
the company and our 1500 employees who
 
04:21:54.950 --> 04:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
live and work in the communities that
 
04:21:57.290 --> 04:21:57.300 align:start position:0%
you represent I encourage you and
 
04:21:59.330 --> 04:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
request that you find this legislation
 
04:22:02.570 --> 04:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
in expedient to legislate as Mr robare
 
04:22:02.580 --> 04:22:03.889 align:start position:0%
in expedient to legislate as Mr robare
said

04:22:03.889 --> 04:22:03.899 align:start position:0%
said
 
04:22:07.849 --> 04:22:07.859 align:start position:0%
um the changes in section two of the
 
04:22:10.790 --> 04:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
proposed Bill if passed would in fact
 
04:22:13.250 --> 04:22:13.260 align:start position:0%
represent a violation of the Fifth
 
04:22:14.450 --> 04:22:14.460 align:start position:0%
Amendment of the United States
 
04:22:17.510 --> 04:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
Constitution as an illegal taking of
 
04:22:20.090 --> 04:22:20.100 align:start position:0%
private property and that's not
 
04:22:22.429 --> 04:22:22.439 align:start position:0%
something we say lightly uh that's not
 
04:22:25.450 --> 04:22:25.460 align:start position:0%
something I I put forth lightly but
 
04:22:28.429 --> 04:22:28.439 align:start position:0%
allow me to explain why that is the case
 
04:22:31.550 --> 04:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
and I'll use the example uh
 
04:22:35.510 --> 04:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
of our most recent I guess our default
 
04:22:37.729 --> 04:22:37.739 align:start position:0%
service rate setting that occurred over
 
04:22:39.710 --> 04:22:39.720 align:start position:0%
the summer
 
04:22:42.530 --> 04:22:42.540 align:start position:0%
the utilities are directed by State
 
04:22:46.370 --> 04:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
Statute and puc order to competitively
 
04:22:49.370 --> 04:22:49.380 align:start position:0%
procure default surface on behalf of our
 
04:22:49.380 --> 04:22:50.389 align:start position:0%
procure default surface on behalf of our
customers

04:22:50.389 --> 04:22:50.399 align:start position:0%
customers
 
04:22:53.210 --> 04:22:53.220 align:start position:0%
what that means is every six months we
 
04:22:57.590 --> 04:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
are required to issue rfps for load
 
04:23:00.590 --> 04:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
following Energy service for our
 
04:23:03.469 --> 04:23:03.479 align:start position:0%
customers we issued those rfps into the
 
04:23:06.670 --> 04:23:06.680 align:start position:0%
competitive Marketplace as Mr Roberts
 
04:23:10.610 --> 04:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
discussed we receive responses back
 
04:23:13.490 --> 04:23:13.500 align:start position:0%
we select the lowest cost response from
 
04:23:16.429 --> 04:23:16.439 align:start position:0%
a viable bidder that is then filed to
 
04:23:18.410 --> 04:23:18.420 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission that
 
04:23:21.050 --> 04:23:21.060 align:start position:0%
reviews the competitive process and
 
04:23:23.590 --> 04:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
ultimately approves the rate based upon
 
04:23:26.269 --> 04:23:26.279 align:start position:0%
that response
 
04:23:29.450 --> 04:23:29.460 align:start position:0%
the utility has little to no control
 
04:23:32.570 --> 04:23:32.580 align:start position:0%
over the responses that get that it
 
04:23:34.070 --> 04:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
receives back from the competitive
 
04:23:36.170 --> 04:23:36.180 align:start position:0%
Marketplace nor does the Public
 
04:23:37.849 --> 04:23:37.859 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission
 
04:23:40.969 --> 04:23:40.979 align:start position:0%
and those costs as Mr Robert said are
 
04:23:43.490 --> 04:23:43.500 align:start position:0%
directly passed through to our customers
 
04:23:45.950 --> 04:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
without any markup or profit margin
 
04:23:47.870 --> 04:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
associated with them
 
04:23:50.269 --> 04:23:50.279 align:start position:0%
over the summer we did that normal
 
04:23:54.229 --> 04:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
solicitation and because of high cost of
 
04:23:56.870 --> 04:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
natural gas market uncertainty driven by
 
04:24:00.410 --> 04:24:00.420 align:start position:0%
global market forces we saw the costs we
 
04:24:01.849 --> 04:24:01.859 align:start position:0%
received back from the competitive
 
04:24:05.269 --> 04:24:05.279 align:start position:0%
Marketplace change from our current rate
 
04:24:06.650 --> 04:24:06.660 align:start position:0%
at the time
 
04:24:12.290 --> 04:24:12.300 align:start position:0%
of 10.6 cents to 22.5 cents
 
04:24:16.130 --> 04:24:16.140 align:start position:0%
which is almost a doubling of the rate
 
04:24:20.030 --> 04:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
utility again has an obligation under
 
04:24:22.490 --> 04:24:22.500 align:start position:0%
State Statute to provide default Service
 
04:24:26.990 --> 04:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
as a financial as a safety net to its
 
04:24:27.000 --> 04:24:28.070 align:start position:0%
as a financial as a safety net to its
customers

04:24:28.070 --> 04:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
customers
 
04:24:30.469 --> 04:24:30.479 align:start position:0%
we have an obligation to provide that
 
04:24:30.479 --> 04:24:31.610 align:start position:0%
we have an obligation to provide that
service

04:24:31.610 --> 04:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
service
 
04:24:35.150 --> 04:24:35.160 align:start position:0%
if this bill were passed at the time
 
04:24:38.450 --> 04:24:38.460 align:start position:0%
the law would have said even though you
 
04:24:40.790 --> 04:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
have competitively sourced this product
 
04:24:43.070 --> 04:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
on behalf of your cost customers
 
04:24:46.790 --> 04:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
following State Statute and puc Order
 
04:24:49.429 --> 04:24:49.439 align:start position:0%
you are not allowed to recover your
 
04:24:52.670 --> 04:24:52.680 align:start position:0%
costs associated with that above the
 
04:24:55.729 --> 04:24:55.739 align:start position:0%
percentage of the federally set Consumer
 
04:24:58.010 --> 04:24:58.020 align:start position:0%
Price Index
 
04:25:01.389 --> 04:25:01.399 align:start position:0%
there would be a significant gap between
 
04:25:04.370 --> 04:25:04.380 align:start position:0%
the cost the utility incurred to provide
 
04:25:05.870 --> 04:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
default service
 
04:25:08.389 --> 04:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
and the cost that we were allowed to
 
04:25:10.429 --> 04:25:10.439 align:start position:0%
recover through rates
 
04:25:12.830 --> 04:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
that is a taking
 
04:25:16.490 --> 04:25:16.500 align:start position:0%
and the utility would go bankrupt
 
04:25:18.410 --> 04:25:18.420 align:start position:0%
and certainly the state of New Hampshire
 
04:25:20.689 --> 04:25:20.699 align:start position:0%
has experience with this and its
 
04:25:20.699 --> 04:25:21.830 align:start position:0%
has experience with this and its
customers

04:25:21.830 --> 04:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
customers
 
04:25:25.370 --> 04:25:25.380 align:start position:0%
this is not an area that we
 
04:25:27.530 --> 04:25:27.540 align:start position:0%
tread lightly on
 
04:25:30.889 --> 04:25:30.899 align:start position:0%
uh this is significant legislation
 
04:25:33.889 --> 04:25:33.899 align:start position:0%
that we hope the committee takes very
 
04:25:33.899 --> 04:25:35.570 align:start position:0%
that we hope the committee takes very
seriously

04:25:35.570 --> 04:25:35.580 align:start position:0%
seriously
 
04:25:37.550 --> 04:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
uh many of the things that the bill
 
04:25:40.790 --> 04:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
sponsor said are factually incorrect
 
04:25:43.309 --> 04:25:43.319 align:start position:0%
about what this bill does
 
04:25:45.229 --> 04:25:45.239 align:start position:0%
what the state of New Hampshire has
 
04:25:48.050 --> 04:25:48.060 align:start position:0%
control over in these areas and the
 
04:25:50.630 --> 04:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
effects of this bill
 
04:25:53.870 --> 04:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
moving on to the other two parts of the
 
04:25:53.880 --> 04:25:55.189 align:start position:0%
moving on to the other two parts of the
bill

04:25:55.189 --> 04:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:25:56.649 --> 04:25:56.659 align:start position:0%
the first
 
04:25:59.870 --> 04:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
would prohibit any one entity from
 
04:26:02.269 --> 04:26:02.279 align:start position:0%
serving more than 50 percent of the
 
04:26:03.769 --> 04:26:03.779 align:start position:0%
market share of the State of New
 
04:26:03.779 --> 04:26:04.969 align:start position:0%
market share of the State of New
Hampshire

04:26:04.969 --> 04:26:04.979 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:26:07.550 --> 04:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
as Mr Roberts pointed out
 
04:26:10.250 --> 04:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
the term market share is not defined
 
04:26:12.889 --> 04:26:12.899 align:start position:0%
which is very important
 
04:26:15.290 --> 04:26:15.300 align:start position:0%
whether that means the geographic area
 
04:26:18.349 --> 04:26:18.359 align:start position:0%
of the state whether that means the
 
04:26:20.570 --> 04:26:20.580 align:start position:0%
sales of electricity within the state
 
04:26:23.450 --> 04:26:23.460 align:start position:0%
whether that means customer account in
 
04:26:25.729 --> 04:26:25.739 align:start position:0%
the state and I would note that two of
 
04:26:29.929 --> 04:26:29.939 align:start position:0%
those three items do change over time
 
04:26:34.550 --> 04:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
finally the bill directs the Attorney
 
04:26:37.070 --> 04:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
General to begin action against
 
04:26:39.229 --> 04:26:39.239 align:start position:0%
eversource by name
 
04:26:41.750 --> 04:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
to quote
 
04:26:44.570 --> 04:26:44.580 align:start position:0%
restore Market competition in New
 
04:26:44.580 --> 04:26:45.950 align:start position:0%
restore Market competition in New
Hampshire

04:26:45.950 --> 04:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:26:49.330 --> 04:26:49.340 align:start position:0%
this appears to stem from the inaccurate
 
04:26:52.790 --> 04:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
understanding of utility distribution
 
04:26:52.800 --> 04:26:53.990 align:start position:0%
understanding of utility distribution
service

04:26:53.990 --> 04:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
service
 
04:26:56.929 --> 04:26:56.939 align:start position:0%
utilities function as natural monopolies
 
04:27:00.530 --> 04:27:00.540 align:start position:0%
because it is less expensive for a
 
04:27:04.250 --> 04:27:04.260 align:start position:0%
single entity to provide a service in a
 
04:27:06.769 --> 04:27:06.779 align:start position:0%
specific area than it would be to have
 
04:27:09.349 --> 04:27:09.359 align:start position:0%
multiple entities providing that same
 
04:27:13.130 --> 04:27:13.140 align:start position:0%
service in place of Market competition
 
04:27:14.990 --> 04:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
because of this
 
04:27:17.649 --> 04:27:17.659 align:start position:0%
we are heavily regulated
 
04:27:21.410 --> 04:27:21.420 align:start position:0%
by State uh by the Public Utilities
 
04:27:23.809 --> 04:27:23.819 align:start position:0%
Commission of the state that is the
 
04:27:27.170 --> 04:27:27.180 align:start position:0%
entity that reviews all of our costs
 
04:27:30.410 --> 04:27:30.420 align:start position:0%
expenses Capital Investments to
 
04:27:32.510 --> 04:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
determine whether those were prudently
 
04:27:35.149 --> 04:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
incurred before setting the rate to
 
04:27:37.189 --> 04:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
recover those costs
 
04:27:41.570 --> 04:27:41.580 align:start position:0%
the idea that small a larger number of
 
04:27:44.450 --> 04:27:44.460 align:start position:0%
smaller utilities will drive Market
 
04:27:47.870 --> 04:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
competition is incorrect
 
04:27:50.990 --> 04:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
you would simply have a larger number of
 
04:27:52.729 --> 04:27:52.739 align:start position:0%
smaller utilities
 
04:27:55.849 --> 04:27:55.859 align:start position:0%
the idea that a larger number of smaller
 
04:27:59.210 --> 04:27:59.220 align:start position:0%
utilities would reduce cost is unfounded
 
04:28:02.630 --> 04:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
as well there are significant benefits
 
04:28:04.090 --> 04:28:04.100 align:start position:0%
from having
 
04:28:07.849 --> 04:28:07.859 align:start position:0%
efficiency of resources due to a larger
 
04:28:11.330 --> 04:28:11.340 align:start position:0%
utility that would be unrealized
 
04:28:13.910 --> 04:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
for these reasons we respectfully asked
 
04:28:16.130 --> 04:28:16.140 align:start position:0%
the committee to find this legislation
 
04:28:18.469 --> 04:28:18.479 align:start position:0%
in expedient to legislate and I would be
 
04:28:20.389 --> 04:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
very happy to answer any questions that
 
04:28:21.550 --> 04:28:21.560 align:start position:0%
I can
 
04:28:24.469 --> 04:28:24.479 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
04:28:27.429 --> 04:28:27.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for your important testimony
 
04:28:29.689 --> 04:28:29.699 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
04:28:31.969 --> 04:28:31.979 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair
 
04:28:34.130 --> 04:28:34.140 align:start position:0%
um you said that you send out rfps every
 
04:28:36.530 --> 04:28:36.540 align:start position:0%
six months uh to determine rates is
 
04:28:38.030 --> 04:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
there anything keeping you from sending
 
04:28:40.969 --> 04:28:40.979 align:start position:0%
them out more often than that yes
 
04:28:44.149 --> 04:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
uh the manner in which we procure
 
04:28:47.710 --> 04:28:47.720 align:start position:0%
default service is defined in puc order
 
04:28:52.729 --> 04:28:52.739 align:start position:0%
26092 which is based upon RSA 374f colon
 
04:28:52.739 --> 04:28:56.689 align:start position:0%
26092 which is based upon RSA 374f colon
3C

04:28:56.689 --> 04:28:56.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:58.910 --> 04:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative
 
04:29:00.769 --> 04:29:00.779 align:start position:0%
Corman has a question
 
04:29:04.490 --> 04:29:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:07.790 --> 04:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
great minds think alike I guess any
 
04:29:09.530 --> 04:29:09.540 align:start position:0%
further questions for
 
04:29:11.990 --> 04:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
Mr locata seeing none I thank you very
 
04:29:12.000 --> 04:29:13.130 align:start position:0%
Mr locata seeing none I thank you very
much

04:29:13.130 --> 04:29:13.140 align:start position:0%
much
 
04:29:16.130 --> 04:29:16.140 align:start position:0%
and I call to the front of the room
 
04:29:18.229 --> 04:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
Mr Don creese from the office of the
 
04:29:20.090 --> 04:29:20.100 align:start position:0%
consumer advocate
 
04:29:22.550 --> 04:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
who will
 
04:29:24.229 --> 04:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
Enlighten us
 
04:29:27.050 --> 04:29:27.060 align:start position:0%
as to why he supports this bill
 
04:29:29.330 --> 04:29:29.340 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman just to
 
04:29:31.010 --> 04:29:31.020 align:start position:0%
reintroduce myself briefly I'm Donald
 
04:29:33.830 --> 04:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
crease the consumer Advocate and as I
 
04:29:35.570 --> 04:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
think you all know by now my job is to
 
04:29:37.130 --> 04:29:37.140 align:start position:0%
represent the interests of residential
 
04:29:39.229 --> 04:29:39.239 align:start position:0%
utility customers
 
04:29:43.189 --> 04:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
um I I thought it would be useful uh to
 
04:29:44.750 --> 04:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
come to the defense of poor old
 
04:29:46.490 --> 04:29:46.500 align:start position:0%
representative Horrigan who I've never
 
04:29:48.830 --> 04:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
met before I didn't recognize him until
 
04:29:50.689 --> 04:29:50.699 align:start position:0%
he walked into the room and I and I
 
04:29:52.610 --> 04:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
didn't agree with the disparaging
 
04:29:54.410 --> 04:29:54.420 align:start position:0%
comment he made at the beginning of his
 
04:29:56.750 --> 04:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
presentation about eversource or
 
04:29:59.030 --> 04:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
corporations in general I I don't think
 
04:30:01.429 --> 04:30:01.439 align:start position:0%
it's helpful to treat anyone or anything
 
04:30:03.889 --> 04:30:03.899 align:start position:0%
as if it's inherently evil and I don't
 
04:30:06.649 --> 04:30:06.659 align:start position:0%
think corporations or eversource are
 
04:30:10.269 --> 04:30:10.279 align:start position:0%
evil but I but I have a lot of sympathy
 
04:30:14.870 --> 04:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
for uh the concern or I'll just say I
 
04:30:17.870 --> 04:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
share the concern that drove him to
 
04:30:21.050 --> 04:30:21.060 align:start position:0%
introduce this bill and and he here is
 
04:30:23.630 --> 04:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
why I'm just going to Rattle off a bunch
 
04:30:26.990 --> 04:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
of prices for you uh now as you know
 
04:30:29.750 --> 04:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
default Energy service is the price that
 
04:30:32.570 --> 04:30:32.580 align:start position:0%
you pay for the electricity that comes
 
04:30:36.290 --> 04:30:36.300 align:start position:0%
out of your wires and you pay that under
 
04:30:38.269 --> 04:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
the Paradigm that was adopted by the
 
04:30:40.269 --> 04:30:40.279 align:start position:0%
legislature in
 
04:30:44.750 --> 04:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
1996 of electric industry restructuring
 
04:30:46.250 --> 04:30:46.260 align:start position:0%
and so I'm just going to Rattle off the
 
04:30:47.870 --> 04:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
prices I know about the New Hampshire
 
04:30:50.689 --> 04:30:50.699 align:start position:0%
Electric Co-op has what it calls Co-op
 
04:30:52.670 --> 04:30:52.680 align:start position:0%
power that's its default Energy service
 
04:30:55.689 --> 04:30:55.699 align:start position:0%
that's 13 cents a kilowatt hour
 
04:30:58.370 --> 04:30:58.380 align:start position:0%
the main Public Utilities Commission
 
04:31:00.889 --> 04:31:00.899 align:start position:0%
which is in charge of what they call
 
04:31:04.370 --> 04:31:04.380 align:start position:0%
Standard offer in Maine so they do the
 
04:31:05.870 --> 04:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
procurement and then they tell the
 
04:31:08.809 --> 04:31:08.819 align:start position:0%
utilities what to charge the two prices
 
04:31:12.469 --> 04:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
they set for this year are depending on
 
04:31:14.389 --> 04:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
which of the two big utilities you're a
 
04:31:17.510 --> 04:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
customer of 16 cents or 17 cents a
 
04:31:19.370 --> 04:31:19.380 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour these are rounded off
 
04:31:19.380 --> 04:31:20.170 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour these are rounded off
numbers

04:31:20.170 --> 04:31:20.180 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
04:31:23.450 --> 04:31:23.460 align:start position:0%
eversources price is 20 cents a kilowatt
 
04:31:26.450 --> 04:31:26.460 align:start position:0%
hour Liberty Utilities price is 22 cents
 
04:31:30.290 --> 04:31:30.300 align:start position:0%
a kilowatt hour and unitils price is 26
 
04:31:33.110 --> 04:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
cents per kilowatt hour and that doesn't
 
04:31:35.389 --> 04:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
even take into account the other
 
04:31:37.610 --> 04:31:37.620 align:start position:0%
components of everybody's electric bills
 
04:31:40.130 --> 04:31:40.140 align:start position:0%
meaning the separate charges that you
 
04:31:42.710 --> 04:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
pay for distribution service the poles
 
04:31:44.809 --> 04:31:44.819 align:start position:0%
and wires and the transmission grid
 
04:31:46.910 --> 04:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
Transmission Service which is uh high
 
04:31:49.910 --> 04:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
voltage so so electricity prices have
 
04:31:52.550 --> 04:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
shot through the roof and we are in a
 
04:31:55.309 --> 04:31:55.319 align:start position:0%
state of Crisis people are suffering and
 
04:31:57.649 --> 04:31:57.659 align:start position:0%
we have this one product default Energy
 
04:32:00.710 --> 04:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
Service that all of these utilities that
 
04:32:03.769 --> 04:32:03.779 align:start position:0%
each has been required to divest of
 
04:32:05.809 --> 04:32:05.819 align:start position:0%
their generation assets are going to the
 
04:32:08.030 --> 04:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
same market and buying and yet the
 
04:32:11.630 --> 04:32:11.640 align:start position:0%
Prices range from a low of 13 cents at
 
04:32:13.490 --> 04:32:13.500 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Electric Co-op all the
 
04:32:16.610 --> 04:32:16.620 align:start position:0%
way up to 26 Cents at Unitil I agree
 
04:32:19.070 --> 04:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
with representative Horrigan that
 
04:32:22.130 --> 04:32:22.140 align:start position:0%
something is wrong and it would be a
 
04:32:24.590 --> 04:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
good idea for the general court to
 
04:32:26.330 --> 04:32:26.340 align:start position:0%
figure out what's wrong and then try to
 
04:32:30.710 --> 04:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
fix it now I do agree with my friends Mr
 
04:32:32.990 --> 04:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
Roberts and Mr locata
 
04:32:35.389 --> 04:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
that we have a constitutional problem
 
04:32:38.269 --> 04:32:38.279 align:start position:0%
here uh and as they've already explained
 
04:32:41.450 --> 04:32:41.460 align:start position:0%
to you when you basically tell a utility
 
04:32:44.269 --> 04:32:44.279 align:start position:0%
that it is not allowed to recover it's
 
04:32:46.969 --> 04:32:46.979 align:start position:0%
prudently incurred costs what you have
 
04:32:49.490 --> 04:32:49.500 align:start position:0%
done in effect has what you've
 
04:32:50.809 --> 04:32:50.819 align:start position:0%
effectively done is taken the
 
04:32:53.649 --> 04:32:53.659 align:start position:0%
shareholders property and confiscated it
 
04:32:56.630 --> 04:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
and apportioned it to public use without
 
04:32:58.849 --> 04:32:58.859 align:start position:0%
just compensation that violates the
 
04:33:00.530 --> 04:33:00.540 align:start position:0%
Fifth Amendment to the U.S Constitution
 
04:33:03.710 --> 04:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
and its state analog and the industry
 
04:33:06.250 --> 04:33:06.260 align:start position:0%
term for that phenomenon is called
 
04:33:09.410 --> 04:33:09.420 align:start position:0%
confiscatory rates that that simply is
 
04:33:12.349 --> 04:33:12.359 align:start position:0%
not okay we might want to do it but if
 
04:33:14.209 --> 04:33:14.219 align:start position:0%
we tried it uh Not only would the
 
04:33:15.949 --> 04:33:15.959 align:start position:0%
utility go bankrupt but it would file a
 
04:33:18.890 --> 04:33:18.900 align:start position:0%
lawsuit long before bankruptcy and they
 
04:33:21.410 --> 04:33:21.420 align:start position:0%
would win in federal court
 
04:33:25.310 --> 04:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
um but I I think it's an overstatement
 
04:33:28.189 --> 04:33:28.199 align:start position:0%
to say that there is nothing that can be
 
04:33:30.709 --> 04:33:30.719 align:start position:0%
done short of imposing confiscatory
 
04:33:32.929 --> 04:33:32.939 align:start position:0%
rates this morning you heard
 
04:33:35.631 --> 04:33:35.641 align:start position:0%
commissioner Simpson of the puc talk to
 
04:33:37.730 --> 04:33:37.740 align:start position:0%
you about natural monopoly but the
 
04:33:40.910 --> 04:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
natural monopoly is not as pervasive and
 
04:33:43.789 --> 04:33:43.799 align:start position:0%
permanent as you might think it is and I
 
04:33:46.429 --> 04:33:46.439 align:start position:0%
have an example and and this goes to the
 
04:33:48.830 --> 04:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
other part of this bill that talks about
 
04:33:53.269 --> 04:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
the uh Monopoly nature of eversource and
 
04:33:55.250 --> 04:33:55.260 align:start position:0%
its counterparts and their market share
 
04:33:58.369 --> 04:33:58.379 align:start position:0%
uh I I think it might be a good idea to
 
04:34:00.590 --> 04:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
go after their Monopoly but I wouldn't
 
04:34:03.051 --> 04:34:03.061 align:start position:0%
carve it up geographically I would carve
 
04:34:05.929 --> 04:34:05.939 align:start position:0%
it up uh I guess functionally and and
 
04:34:07.369 --> 04:34:07.379 align:start position:0%
here's what I'm really thinking about
 
04:34:11.330 --> 04:34:11.340 align:start position:0%
the natural monopoly in meters if there
 
04:34:13.849 --> 04:34:13.859 align:start position:0%
ever was one is crumbling there is no
 
04:34:17.029 --> 04:34:17.039 align:start position:0%
reason why your local Distribution
 
04:34:19.250 --> 04:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
Company whether it's eversource Unitil
 
04:34:23.570 --> 04:34:23.580 align:start position:0%
Liberty or the co-op should be should
 
04:34:25.929 --> 04:34:25.939 align:start position:0%
have an absolute
 
04:34:28.849 --> 04:34:28.859 align:start position:0%
Monopoly on the meters some of you might
 
04:34:30.230 --> 04:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
be old enough to remember when in order
 
04:34:32.449 --> 04:34:32.459 align:start position:0%
to have a telephone you had to rent a
 
04:34:32.459 --> 04:34:33.109 align:start position:0%
to have a telephone you had to rent a
telephone

04:34:33.109 --> 04:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
telephone
 
04:34:36.709 --> 04:34:36.719 align:start position:0%
from the local Bell Telephone Company uh
 
04:34:39.109 --> 04:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
that that was done in by the U.S justice
 
04:34:41.810 --> 04:34:41.820 align:start position:0%
department in the 1980s and it is time
 
04:34:44.510 --> 04:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
to do exactly the same thing with meters
 
04:34:46.849 --> 04:34:46.859 align:start position:0%
there's just no reason why another
 
04:34:49.250 --> 04:34:49.260 align:start position:0%
company can't Supply you with a utility
 
04:34:51.470 --> 04:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
grade meter and the reason the utilities
 
04:34:53.269 --> 04:34:53.279 align:start position:0%
don't want to do that the reason
 
04:34:54.949 --> 04:34:54.959 align:start position:0%
eversource I think doesn't want to do
 
04:34:57.230 --> 04:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
that is because that surrenders a key
 
04:35:00.289 --> 04:35:00.299 align:start position:0%
part of the utilities hegemony and
 
04:35:02.449 --> 04:35:02.459 align:start position:0%
eversource has notably dragged its feet
 
04:35:04.609 --> 04:35:04.619 align:start position:0%
on deploying Advanced metering
 
04:35:07.310 --> 04:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in this state yesterday
 
04:35:09.170 --> 04:35:09.180 align:start position:0%
over in the Senate they took credit for
 
04:35:11.750 --> 04:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
the fact that they are now conducting a
 
04:35:14.269 --> 04:35:14.279 align:start position:0%
study of the feasibility of Ami
 
04:35:15.830 --> 04:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
deployment Advanced metering
 
04:35:17.929 --> 04:35:17.939 align:start position:0%
infrastructure deployment why are they
 
04:35:20.090 --> 04:35:20.100 align:start position:0%
doing that because I insisted that they
 
04:35:22.670 --> 04:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
do that as a condition of my signature
 
04:35:24.470 --> 04:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
on the settlement agreement that
 
04:35:26.929 --> 04:35:26.939 align:start position:0%
resolved their last rate case but every
 
04:35:28.730 --> 04:35:28.740 align:start position:0%
other utility in the state is farther
 
04:35:31.010 --> 04:35:31.020 align:start position:0%
ahead than eversource is on Advanced
 
04:35:33.949 --> 04:35:33.959 align:start position:0%
metering infrastructure that is a
 
04:35:33.959 --> 04:35:35.590 align:start position:0%
metering infrastructure that is a
problem

04:35:35.590 --> 04:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
problem
 
04:35:37.609 --> 04:35:37.619 align:start position:0%
this morning you heard from the puc
 
04:35:38.990 --> 04:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and they talked about
 
04:35:40.429 --> 04:35:40.439 align:start position:0%
default service and what they're doing
 
04:35:42.051 --> 04:35:42.061 align:start position:0%
about it and they mentioned that they
 
04:35:44.810 --> 04:35:44.820 align:start position:0%
have an open investigation that's true
 
04:35:46.429 --> 04:35:46.439 align:start position:0%
but we've known that this has been a
 
04:35:49.551 --> 04:35:49.561 align:start position:0%
crisis for over a year now and so far
 
04:35:52.609 --> 04:35:52.619 align:start position:0%
nothing has happened it appears that the
 
04:35:56.090 --> 04:35:56.100 align:start position:0%
puc's attention was focused on the
 
04:35:59.090 --> 04:35:59.100 align:start position:0%
report that they just issued which uh I
 
04:35:59.100 --> 04:36:01.390 align:start position:0%
report that they just issued which uh I
I think

04:36:01.390 --> 04:36:01.400 align:start position:0%
I think
 
04:36:04.490 --> 04:36:04.500 align:start position:0%
was intended to undermine the case for
 
04:36:06.890 --> 04:36:06.900 align:start position:0%
continuing to have rate payer funded
 
04:36:08.929 --> 04:36:08.939 align:start position:0%
energy and efficiency in New Hampshire
 
04:36:10.730 --> 04:36:10.740 align:start position:0%
what they really should be focusing on
 
04:36:13.310 --> 04:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
is default Energy service because we
 
04:36:15.890 --> 04:36:15.900 align:start position:0%
need to change the way that we procure
 
04:36:18.650 --> 04:36:18.660 align:start position:0%
default Energy service and I think since
 
04:36:21.349 --> 04:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
this is a public policy problem it is a
 
04:36:24.109 --> 04:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
subject that is ripe for you the general
 
04:36:27.230 --> 04:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
court to consider and I have a modest
 
04:36:31.250 --> 04:36:31.260 align:start position:0%
proposal I think it is time to do all of
 
04:36:32.990 --> 04:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
the default Energy Service procurement
 
04:36:35.810 --> 04:36:35.820 align:start position:0%
at the same time essentially in the same
 
04:36:38.631 --> 04:36:38.641 align:start position:0%
room much as they do in Maine where the
 
04:36:40.490 --> 04:36:40.500 align:start position:0%
main puc does it here in New Hampshire
 
04:36:43.010 --> 04:36:43.020 align:start position:0%
we could have the state department of
 
04:36:44.750 --> 04:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
energy do it and we could even
 
04:36:47.150 --> 04:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
completely change the Paradigm and
 
04:36:48.830 --> 04:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
instead of putting out requests for
 
04:36:50.810 --> 04:36:50.820 align:start position:0%
proposals we could actually do a
 
04:36:53.390 --> 04:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
descending clock live auction so that
 
04:36:55.010 --> 04:36:55.020 align:start position:0%
the bidders can kind of eyeball each
 
04:36:57.890 --> 04:36:57.900 align:start position:0%
other and that might reduce the whopping
 
04:37:00.230 --> 04:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
big risk premium that we're all paying
 
04:37:03.529 --> 04:37:03.539 align:start position:0%
to compensate the wholesale suppliers
 
04:37:05.929 --> 04:37:05.939 align:start position:0%
for the uncertainty that they perceive
 
04:37:08.029 --> 04:37:08.039 align:start position:0%
in the in the market I guess the last
 
04:37:09.830 --> 04:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
thing I want to say by way of my
 
04:37:11.869 --> 04:37:11.879 align:start position:0%
testimony today is that there actually
 
04:37:13.970 --> 04:37:13.980 align:start position:0%
is a case it's appeal of Public Service
 
04:37:16.131 --> 04:37:16.141 align:start position:0%
Company of New Hampshire it's reported
 
04:37:18.590 --> 04:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
at page 13 of volume 141 of the New
 
04:37:20.631 --> 04:37:20.641 align:start position:0%
Hampshire reporter it was decided in
 
04:37:23.510 --> 04:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
1996 and it says that electric utility
 
04:37:27.051 --> 04:37:27.061 align:start position:0%
franchises are not exclusive now it
 
04:37:29.510 --> 04:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
would be ridiculously inefficient to
 
04:37:32.029 --> 04:37:32.039 align:start position:0%
build out a redundant Distribution
 
04:37:34.010 --> 04:37:34.020 align:start position:0%
Systems in New Hampshire that's why
 
04:37:36.650 --> 04:37:36.660 align:start position:0%
nobody wants to do it but the utilities
 
04:37:38.209 --> 04:37:38.219 align:start position:0%
even though they would like you to think
 
04:37:40.369 --> 04:37:40.379 align:start position:0%
that they have guaranteed cost recovery
 
04:37:43.250 --> 04:37:43.260 align:start position:0%
and an iron climate Ironclad Monopoly
 
04:37:45.410 --> 04:37:45.420 align:start position:0%
neither of those things is true the
 
04:37:47.330 --> 04:37:47.340 align:start position:0%
Constitution simply secures to the
 
04:37:49.970 --> 04:37:49.980 align:start position:0%
utilities a right for a reasonable
 
04:37:52.250 --> 04:37:52.260 align:start position:0%
opportunity to earn a reasonable return
 
04:37:55.269 --> 04:37:55.279 align:start position:0%
on their investment it is not guaranteed
 
04:37:58.551 --> 04:37:58.561 align:start position:0%
and it is theoretically possible for
 
04:37:59.990 --> 04:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
competitors to come in and actually
 
04:38:01.789 --> 04:38:01.799 align:start position:0%
challenge the district attribution
 
04:38:04.010 --> 04:38:04.020 align:start position:0%
companies monopolies
 
04:38:06.650 --> 04:38:06.660 align:start position:0%
oh I think that is everything I wanted
 
04:38:08.330 --> 04:38:08.340 align:start position:0%
to cover I promised I would do it in
 
04:38:11.689 --> 04:38:11.699 align:start position:0%
four minutes I have a feeling I failed
 
04:38:13.970 --> 04:38:13.980 align:start position:0%
I wasn't timing you but I have a feeling
 
04:38:16.010 --> 04:38:16.020 align:start position:0%
you failed as well
 
04:38:17.869 --> 04:38:17.879 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask you a question though
 
04:38:20.330 --> 04:38:20.340 align:start position:0%
about something that you did mention
 
04:38:23.810 --> 04:38:23.820 align:start position:0%
just a moment ago and that was
 
04:38:28.189 --> 04:38:28.199 align:start position:0%
removing the Monopoly on metering
 
04:38:30.230 --> 04:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
if we did that
 
04:38:32.689 --> 04:38:32.699 align:start position:0%
would we end up with a kind of a wild
 
04:38:35.631 --> 04:38:35.641 align:start position:0%
west situation where we would have all
 
04:38:38.150 --> 04:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
kinds of different mismatched meters all
 
04:38:39.349 --> 04:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
over the place and how would the
 
04:38:41.750 --> 04:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
utilities cope with that that's a really
 
04:38:43.310 --> 04:38:43.320 align:start position:0%
excellent question so thank you for
 
04:38:46.010 --> 04:38:46.020 align:start position:0%
asking me that chairman Vose and I I
 
04:38:48.551 --> 04:38:48.561 align:start position:0%
think the answer is that I would not
 
04:38:51.970 --> 04:38:51.980 align:start position:0%
suggest that we open up the Wild West
 
04:38:55.369 --> 04:38:55.379 align:start position:0%
it's important for uh every meter that's
 
04:38:58.849 --> 04:38:58.859 align:start position:0%
used for electric service be so-called a
 
04:39:01.670 --> 04:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
so-called utility grade meter so there
 
04:39:04.310 --> 04:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
are technical technical standards
 
04:39:05.869 --> 04:39:05.879 align:start position:0%
because obviously we need our electric
 
04:39:08.570 --> 04:39:08.580 align:start position:0%
service to be accurately and properly
 
04:39:11.330 --> 04:39:11.340 align:start position:0%
metered and it would be I think
 
04:39:14.330 --> 04:39:14.340 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the regulator it would
 
04:39:15.949 --> 04:39:15.959 align:start position:0%
either here be either the department of
 
04:39:19.131 --> 04:39:19.141 align:start position:0%
energy or the puc to actually scrutinize
 
04:39:22.609 --> 04:39:22.619 align:start position:0%
which specific uh which specific meters
 
04:39:24.349 --> 04:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
are authorized for use in New Hampshire
 
04:39:27.830 --> 04:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
and since you asked about this
 
04:39:27.840 --> 04:39:28.609 align:start position:0%
and since you asked about this
um

04:39:28.609 --> 04:39:28.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:30.590 --> 04:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons for taking a look at
 
04:39:33.109 --> 04:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
the meter Monopoly is the Advent of
 
04:39:35.209 --> 04:39:35.219 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles because electric
 
04:39:37.788 --> 04:39:37.798 align:start position:0%
vehicles are great grid resources right
 
04:39:40.130 --> 04:39:40.140 align:start position:0%
they're big batteries they tend to sit
 
04:39:42.230 --> 04:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
in our driveways or parking garages for
 
04:39:44.570 --> 04:39:44.580 align:start position:0%
about 90 plus percent of the time and
 
04:39:45.830 --> 04:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
while they're idle while we're not
 
04:39:47.810 --> 04:39:47.820 align:start position:0%
driving them they are potential grid
 
04:39:50.708 --> 04:39:50.718 align:start position:0%
resources and the auto manufacturers
 
04:39:53.810 --> 04:39:53.820 align:start position:0%
either are or can include utility grade
 
04:39:56.830 --> 04:39:56.840 align:start position:0%
meters right in the cars
 
04:40:00.590 --> 04:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
so to follow up on that question
 
04:40:00.600 --> 04:40:05.230 align:start position:0%
so to follow up on that question
foreign

04:40:05.230 --> 04:40:05.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:08.270 --> 04:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
purchase of any utility grade meter fall
 
04:40:10.070 --> 04:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
on the customer
 
04:40:13.208 --> 04:40:13.218 align:start position:0%
and if it did wouldn't that eliminate
 
04:40:15.770 --> 04:40:15.780 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
04:40:19.130 --> 04:40:19.140 align:start position:0%
the buying power that a big organization
 
04:40:21.470 --> 04:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
like a utility could have to lower the
 
04:40:23.630 --> 04:40:23.640 align:start position:0%
cost of those meters
 
04:40:25.670 --> 04:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
well I I thank you for that question too
 
04:40:27.830 --> 04:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh and I think I have two different
 
04:40:30.410 --> 04:40:30.420 align:start position:0%
answers I mean my first plenary answer
 
04:40:32.570 --> 04:40:32.580 align:start position:0%
to almost every question I get is that
 
04:40:34.490 --> 04:40:34.500 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day there's only one
 
04:40:36.410 --> 04:40:36.420 align:start position:0%
wallet in the room and that is the
 
04:40:37.910 --> 04:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
wallet in the back pocket of the
 
04:40:40.788 --> 04:40:40.798 align:start position:0%
ratepayer so no matter what we do in
 
04:40:43.330 --> 04:40:43.340 align:start position:0%
order to regulate energy
 
04:40:45.890 --> 04:40:45.900 align:start position:0%
it's only customers who are going to pay
 
04:40:48.410 --> 04:40:48.420 align:start position:0%
all the costs eventually every company
 
04:40:50.630 --> 04:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
that provides any part of this service
 
04:40:52.670 --> 04:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
to customers is going to expect to
 
04:40:54.830 --> 04:40:54.840 align:start position:0%
recover its costs from those customers
 
04:40:56.810 --> 04:40:56.820 align:start position:0%
but in response to your specific
 
04:40:59.270 --> 04:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
question I'm not necessarily saying that
 
04:41:01.850 --> 04:41:01.860 align:start position:0%
the customer has to be the owner of the
 
04:41:03.708 --> 04:41:03.718 align:start position:0%
meter I'm saying that we should give the
 
04:41:05.930 --> 04:41:05.940 align:start position:0%
customers choice you might you might
 
04:41:08.868 --> 04:41:08.878 align:start position:0%
want to well you might you might live in
 
04:41:11.690 --> 04:41:11.700 align:start position:0%
a community power aggregation community
 
04:41:14.090 --> 04:41:14.100 align:start position:0%
and your community power aggregator
 
04:41:15.708 --> 04:41:15.718 align:start position:0%
whether it's the community power
 
04:41:18.050 --> 04:41:18.060 align:start position:0%
Coalition of New Hampshire or some other
 
04:41:20.330 --> 04:41:20.340 align:start position:0%
aggregate aggregator it ought to be able
 
04:41:22.070 --> 04:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
to supply you with the meter that's what
 
04:41:23.330 --> 04:41:23.340 align:start position:0%
I mean by the utility shouldn't have
 
04:41:27.110 --> 04:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
them on Monopoly maybe cpcnh has I'm
 
04:41:28.788 --> 04:41:28.798 align:start position:0%
sure if you brought Cliff Below in here
 
04:41:31.970 --> 04:41:31.980 align:start position:0%
he could tell you a great idea for how
 
04:41:35.030 --> 04:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
you know his organization should deploy
 
04:41:36.708 --> 04:41:36.718 align:start position:0%
the meter and they can use it to do all
 
04:41:38.270 --> 04:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
kinds of cool things that aren't
 
04:41:40.010 --> 04:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
provided by the utility and then they
 
04:41:42.650 --> 04:41:42.660 align:start position:0%
can report the usage data reliably to
 
04:41:44.510 --> 04:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
the utility and then either the
 
04:41:46.610 --> 04:41:46.620 align:start position:0%
Coalition or the utility will render the
 
04:41:48.708 --> 04:41:48.718 align:start position:0%
bill so that the utility actually gets
 
04:41:50.390 --> 04:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
its money
 
04:41:52.910 --> 04:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
thank you and I want to apologize to the
 
04:41:55.070 --> 04:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I violated one
 
04:41:58.610 --> 04:41:58.620 align:start position:0%
of our sacrosync committee rules which
 
04:42:01.550 --> 04:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
is uh to talk about things that are not
 
04:42:03.890 --> 04:42:03.900 align:start position:0%
directly related to the bill which I
 
04:42:06.110 --> 04:42:06.120 align:start position:0%
just did but it was such a fascinating
 
04:42:09.470 --> 04:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
question to me I just had to ask it but
 
04:42:11.270 --> 04:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
I will remind members that we're here to
 
04:42:13.030 --> 04:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
ask questions related to the bill
 
04:42:17.208 --> 04:42:17.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:20.270 --> 04:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so
 
04:42:20.280 --> 04:42:21.170 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so
um

04:42:21.170 --> 04:42:21.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:23.090 --> 04:42:23.100 align:start position:0%
metering although I'm not part of the
 
04:42:24.948 --> 04:42:24.958 align:start position:0%
bill is one of the issues that you
 
04:42:28.448 --> 04:42:28.458 align:start position:0%
brought up that needs to be addressed
 
04:42:32.090 --> 04:42:32.100 align:start position:0%
and the implication of your discussion
 
04:42:35.690 --> 04:42:35.700 align:start position:0%
was that if we had utilities not owning
 
04:42:37.250 --> 04:42:37.260 align:start position:0%
The Meters we're going to get a
 
04:42:40.250 --> 04:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
reduction in cost yet you raised the
 
04:42:43.430 --> 04:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
costs default costs of the of the three
 
04:42:46.850 --> 04:42:46.860 align:start position:0%
utilities eversource was lowest
 
04:42:49.190 --> 04:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
Liberty and utility were the highest
 
04:42:52.368 --> 04:42:52.378 align:start position:0%
they're the ones that have the the have
 
04:42:56.150 --> 04:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
the the new technology in the meters so
 
04:42:58.430 --> 04:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
how do you display
 
04:43:01.910 --> 04:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
um reconcile what seems to be your your
 
04:43:04.490 --> 04:43:04.500 align:start position:0%
point with the facts uh thank you
 
04:43:05.628 --> 04:43:05.638 align:start position:0%
representative that's another really
 
04:43:08.150 --> 04:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
good question and the answer is that the
 
04:43:10.850 --> 04:43:10.860 align:start position:0%
cost of the meters is not recovered
 
04:43:12.288 --> 04:43:12.298 align:start position:0%
through the default Energy service
 
04:43:14.390 --> 04:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
charge the utilities are recovering
 
04:43:16.610 --> 04:43:16.620 align:start position:0%
their metering costs in their
 
04:43:20.390 --> 04:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
distribution charges so the fact that
 
04:43:22.670 --> 04:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
the companies are doing different things
 
04:43:25.788 --> 04:43:25.798 align:start position:0%
in the metering realm has no bearing on
 
04:43:27.590 --> 04:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
the costs that they are charging for
 
04:43:29.810 --> 04:43:29.820 align:start position:0%
default service that's really a function
 
04:43:32.750 --> 04:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
of their interaction with the wholesale
 
04:43:35.030 --> 04:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
market and so the reason for example the
 
04:43:37.788 --> 04:43:37.798 align:start position:0%
Electric Co-op has advanced metering
 
04:43:39.288 --> 04:43:39.298 align:start position:0%
they led the way with Advanced metering
 
04:43:41.330 --> 04:43:41.340 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in New Hampshire but
 
04:43:42.770 --> 04:43:42.780 align:start position:0%
that's not the reason their price is low
 
04:43:44.628 --> 04:43:44.638 align:start position:0%
the reason their price is low is that
 
04:43:46.970 --> 04:43:46.980 align:start position:0%
they are actively managing their default
 
04:43:49.010 --> 04:43:49.020 align:start position:0%
Energy Service portfolio and you heard
 
04:43:51.288 --> 04:43:51.298 align:start position:0%
the word laddering this morning that's a
 
04:43:53.448 --> 04:43:53.458 align:start position:0%
big part of what that kind of active
 
04:43:56.448 --> 04:43:56.458 align:start position:0%
management uh entails I hope that was an
 
04:43:58.310 --> 04:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
adequate answer but you're about to ask
 
04:44:01.010 --> 04:44:01.020 align:start position:0%
a follow-up so maybe it wasn't follow-up
 
04:44:03.110 --> 04:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
follow-up because it goes to what you
 
04:44:06.350 --> 04:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
just said the the co-op is allowed to
 
04:44:10.250 --> 04:44:10.260 align:start position:0%
ladder yet you heard Mr locata say that
 
04:44:12.948 --> 04:44:12.958 align:start position:0%
the utilities are not allowed to do that
 
04:44:16.730 --> 04:44:16.740 align:start position:0%
they are required by puc regulation and
 
04:44:19.128 --> 04:44:19.138 align:start position:0%
I heard statute I didn't realize that
 
04:44:22.368 --> 04:44:22.378 align:start position:0%
right that that order came out of the
 
04:44:22.378 --> 04:44:23.350 align:start position:0%
right that that order came out of the
statute

04:44:23.350 --> 04:44:23.360 align:start position:0%
statute
 
04:44:26.628 --> 04:44:26.638 align:start position:0%
but if that is indeed the case what
 
04:44:28.788 --> 04:44:28.798 align:start position:0%
you're proposing is not possible
 
04:44:32.208 --> 04:44:32.218 align:start position:0%
well I want to give eversource it's due
 
04:44:37.190 --> 04:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
here because uh first of all the statute
 
04:44:40.970 --> 04:44:40.980 align:start position:0%
RSA 374f does not require a particular
 
04:44:44.390 --> 04:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
method of procurement the method of
 
04:44:46.128 --> 04:44:46.138 align:start position:0%
procurement that the utilities are now
 
04:44:49.670 --> 04:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
required to use was imposed on them by
 
04:44:52.190 --> 04:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
puc order and and I'm not this is no
 
04:44:53.810 --> 04:44:53.820 align:start position:0%
criticism of the three Commissioners who
 
04:44:56.030 --> 04:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
were here this morning this happened way
 
04:44:58.010 --> 04:44:58.020 align:start position:0%
before they appeared on the scene at
 
04:44:59.030 --> 04:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
least way before they became
 
04:45:01.970 --> 04:45:01.980 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and so the previous puc
 
04:45:04.310 --> 04:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
actually several pucs ago told
 
04:45:06.650 --> 04:45:06.660 align:start position:0%
eversource over its objection I think
 
04:45:08.510 --> 04:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
the record will show that it had to do
 
04:45:10.310 --> 04:45:10.320 align:start position:0%
its procurement this way they wanted to
 
04:45:12.890 --> 04:45:12.900 align:start position:0%
be a more Vigilant market player and
 
04:45:14.448 --> 04:45:14.458 align:start position:0%
they were told they couldn't
 
04:45:16.250 --> 04:45:16.260 align:start position:0%
so if you want to blame somebody it's
 
04:45:19.128 --> 04:45:19.138 align:start position:0%
the old puc and that has the advantage
 
04:45:21.890 --> 04:45:21.900 align:start position:0%
of being nobody that we're able to uh
 
04:45:23.990 --> 04:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
criticize now here right in the room
 
04:45:26.868 --> 04:45:26.878 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Kaplan has a
 
04:45:29.570 --> 04:45:29.580 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and uh thank
 
04:45:31.490 --> 04:45:31.500 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I would I
 
04:45:33.050 --> 04:45:33.060 align:start position:0%
want to maybe get back to the default
 
04:45:34.610 --> 04:45:34.620 align:start position:0%
service rate I'm not sure I'm going to
 
04:45:36.948 --> 04:45:36.958 align:start position:0%
with this question but you mentioned a
 
04:45:38.628 --> 04:45:38.638 align:start position:0%
risk premium
 
04:45:40.910 --> 04:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
that where that rate payers are paying
 
04:45:43.430 --> 04:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
is that something that is built in to
 
04:45:44.868 --> 04:45:44.878 align:start position:0%
the default service rate by the
 
04:45:46.610 --> 04:45:46.620 align:start position:0%
utilities or is that where does that
 
04:45:48.948 --> 04:45:48.958 align:start position:0%
risk premium come from uh that risk
 
04:45:51.948 --> 04:45:51.958 align:start position:0%
premium is embedded in the bids that
 
04:45:54.708 --> 04:45:54.718 align:start position:0%
wholesale suppliers provide to the
 
04:45:57.110 --> 04:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
utilities in response to their rfps
 
04:45:59.448 --> 04:45:59.458 align:start position:0%
every six months because really what
 
04:46:01.250 --> 04:46:01.260 align:start position:0%
restructuring does is it takes a pile of
 
04:46:04.490 --> 04:46:04.500 align:start position:0%
risk and it reallocates it takes it off
 
04:46:07.190 --> 04:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
the back of rate payers essentially and
 
04:46:09.230 --> 04:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
puts it on the back of these uh
 
04:46:12.350 --> 04:46:12.360 align:start position:0%
competitive wholesale suppliers and in
 
04:46:15.170 --> 04:46:15.180 align:start position:0%
order to uh agree to take on the risk
 
04:46:17.750 --> 04:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
they include a premium in the bids that
 
04:46:19.550 --> 04:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
they make
 
04:46:21.770 --> 04:46:21.780 align:start position:0%
follow-up if I make
 
04:46:23.990 --> 04:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
is uh is that risk premium differ
 
04:46:25.670 --> 04:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
according to utilities or is that
 
04:46:28.310 --> 04:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
something determined by the puc the puc
 
04:46:30.170 --> 04:46:30.180 align:start position:0%
doesn't determine the risk premium that
 
04:46:31.730 --> 04:46:31.740 align:start position:0%
is entirely up to the bidders and
 
04:46:33.288 --> 04:46:33.298 align:start position:0%
remember what we're talking about here
 
04:46:35.628 --> 04:46:35.638 align:start position:0%
is a market process right it's a
 
04:46:38.628 --> 04:46:38.638 align:start position:0%
competitive bidding process so uh nobody
 
04:46:41.448 --> 04:46:41.458 align:start position:0%
but the bidders knows how they decided
 
04:46:44.090 --> 04:46:44.100 align:start position:0%
on what their bids would be I mean I I
 
04:46:46.128 --> 04:46:46.138 align:start position:0%
see some confidential information about
 
04:46:48.170 --> 04:46:48.180 align:start position:0%
the bids they're a little more granular
 
04:46:50.030 --> 04:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
than gets talked about here because they
 
04:46:52.610 --> 04:46:52.620 align:start position:0%
actually propose a series of monthly
 
04:46:54.948 --> 04:46:54.958 align:start position:0%
prices that are then aggregated and you
 
04:46:56.510 --> 04:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
can see that you know that the different
 
04:46:58.910 --> 04:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
bidders have different ideas of what the
 
04:47:01.190 --> 04:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
right monthly price is and that reflects
 
04:47:03.410 --> 04:47:03.420 align:start position:0%
their prognostications about what's
 
04:47:05.208 --> 04:47:05.218 align:start position:0%
going to happen in the Electric market
 
04:47:07.430 --> 04:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
in the six months covered by their bids
 
04:47:09.050 --> 04:47:09.060 align:start position:0%
and they also have to worry about
 
04:47:11.690 --> 04:47:11.700 align:start position:0%
default Energy Service migration because
 
04:47:13.550 --> 04:47:13.560 align:start position:0%
people have the right to go away leave
 
04:47:15.288 --> 04:47:15.298 align:start position:0%
default service and either go on
 
04:47:18.230 --> 04:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
competitive Supply or if they're in a
 
04:47:20.090 --> 04:47:20.100 align:start position:0%
community power aggregation Community
 
04:47:22.128 --> 04:47:22.138 align:start position:0%
they have the right to participate in
 
04:47:23.990 --> 04:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
their Community power aggregation that
 
04:47:25.430 --> 04:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
is another form of risk to these
 
04:47:28.128 --> 04:47:28.138 align:start position:0%
wholesale suppliers
 
04:47:28.138 --> 04:47:29.208 align:start position:0%
wholesale suppliers
okay

04:47:29.208 --> 04:47:29.218 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:47:31.610 --> 04:47:31.620 align:start position:0%
before I call on representative munz for
 
04:47:35.330 --> 04:47:35.340 align:start position:0%
another question I'm going to make an
 
04:47:37.070 --> 04:47:37.080 align:start position:0%
announcement that I think all the
 
04:47:40.070 --> 04:47:40.080 align:start position:0%

04:47:41.930 --> 04:47:41.940 align:start position:0%

might be added so we could be here till
 
04:48:52.550 --> 04:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
six o'clock and I don't know what the
 
04:48:54.110 --> 04:48:54.120 align:start position:0%
weather will be like at six o'clock but
 
04:48:56.150 --> 04:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
apparently it's going to be bad
 
04:48:56.160 --> 04:48:57.770 align:start position:0%
apparently it's going to be bad
so

04:48:57.770 --> 04:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:48:57.780 --> 04:48:58.550 align:start position:0%

04:49:01.010 --> 04:49:01.020 align:start position:0%
that offer has been made feel free to
 
04:49:03.530 --> 04:49:03.540 align:start position:0%
use your own judgment to decide whether
 
04:49:06.110 --> 04:49:06.120 align:start position:0%
to take uh advantage of it or not
 
04:49:09.590 --> 04:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
okay now representative munz let's try
 
04:49:11.448 --> 04:49:11.458 align:start position:0%
to make this the last question on this
 
04:49:14.750 --> 04:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
bill or for this uh testifier because we
 
04:49:16.070 --> 04:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
have three more people who want to
 
04:49:19.250 --> 04:49:19.260 align:start position:0%
justify thank you Mr chairman I I had a
 
04:49:21.350 --> 04:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
wonderful follow-up to Chairman boss's
 
04:49:23.930 --> 04:49:23.940 align:start position:0%
question about meters but in deference
 
04:49:26.270 --> 04:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
to the rules I'm not going to ask that
 
04:49:28.910 --> 04:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
one my question hopefully is pretty
 
04:49:32.350 --> 04:49:32.360 align:start position:0%
straightforward if we want to we the
 
04:49:36.230 --> 04:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
legislature wanted to enable
 
04:49:40.368 --> 04:49:40.378 align:start position:0%
uh eversource to go out for bids on a
 
04:49:41.868 --> 04:49:41.878 align:start position:0%
more frequent basis than every six
 
04:49:46.730 --> 04:49:46.740 align:start position:0%
months would we need to amend RSA 374f
 
04:49:49.190 --> 04:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
my answer is that is likely the place
 
04:49:51.050 --> 04:49:51.060 align:start position:0%
where you would want to insert language
 
04:49:54.170 --> 04:49:54.180 align:start position:0%
to that effect yes you you wouldn't need
 
04:49:57.170 --> 04:49:57.180 align:start position:0%
to amend because right now the puc has
 
04:49:59.390 --> 04:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
the authority to tell the utilities to
 
04:50:02.448 --> 04:50:02.458 align:start position:0%
do that and I I think that's the nature
 
04:50:05.810 --> 04:50:05.820 align:start position:0%
of their investigation but you know I'm
 
04:50:07.910 --> 04:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
frustrated because there's a lot of
 
04:50:10.550 --> 04:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
delay here nothing has happened yet the
 
04:50:13.010 --> 04:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
next procurement period is looming upon
 
04:50:15.050 --> 04:50:15.060 align:start position:0%
us because those rfps have to go out
 
04:50:17.208 --> 04:50:17.218 align:start position:0%
really just a few weeks from now and so
 
04:50:19.190 --> 04:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
we're not going to change anything in
 
04:50:20.930 --> 04:50:20.940 align:start position:0%
connection with the next six months so
 
04:50:22.368 --> 04:50:22.378 align:start position:0%
we're really not looking at any change
 
04:50:25.368 --> 04:50:25.378 align:start position:0%
until next February a year from now I'm
 
04:50:27.050 --> 04:50:27.060 align:start position:0%
frustrated and so that's why I'm
 
04:50:28.850 --> 04:50:28.860 align:start position:0%
suggesting that the legislature maybe
 
04:50:31.490 --> 04:50:31.500 align:start position:0%
actually do something like what you are
 
04:50:34.190 --> 04:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
at least implying you could do
 
04:50:36.650 --> 04:50:36.660 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up quick follow-up
 
04:50:36.660 --> 04:50:37.250 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up quick follow-up
um

04:50:37.250 --> 04:50:37.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:37.260 --> 04:50:38.810 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:50:38.810 --> 04:50:38.820 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:50:38.820 --> 04:50:39.590 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:50:39.590 --> 04:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:41.628 --> 04:50:41.638 align:start position:0%
if we don't necessarily have to amend
 
04:50:46.670 --> 04:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
that RSA what do we need to do to do we
 
04:50:49.730 --> 04:50:49.740 align:start position:0%
need then need to change the the powers
 
04:50:53.090 --> 04:50:53.100 align:start position:0%
or authorizations that the puc has
 
04:50:55.610 --> 04:50:55.620 align:start position:0%
you could do it any number of ways I
 
04:50:57.410 --> 04:50:57.420 align:start position:0%
think the recommendation I would make if
 
04:51:00.470 --> 04:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
I were to put my drafting cap on would
 
04:51:03.830 --> 04:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
be to insert some language in RSA 374f
 
04:51:07.250 --> 04:51:07.260 align:start position:0%
that tells the puc here is how we the
 
04:51:10.430 --> 04:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
general court want the utilities to do
 
04:51:14.570 --> 04:51:14.580 align:start position:0%
this I think it is an occasion for a
 
04:51:14.580 --> 04:51:16.030 align:start position:0%
this I think it is an occasion for a
rather

04:51:16.030 --> 04:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
rather
 
04:51:16.040 --> 04:51:17.770 align:start position:0%
rather
muscular

04:51:17.770 --> 04:51:17.780 align:start position:0%
muscular
 
04:51:17.780 --> 04:51:20.110 align:start position:0%
muscular
definition

04:51:20.110 --> 04:51:20.120 align:start position:0%
definition
 
04:51:23.410 --> 04:51:23.420 align:start position:0%
muscular exercise of public policy
 
04:51:28.250 --> 04:51:28.260 align:start position:0%
Authority by the legislature thank you
 
04:51:30.708 --> 04:51:30.718 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I think we need to move
 
04:51:34.010 --> 04:51:34.020 align:start position:0%
on at this point uh so I'm going to ask
 
04:51:36.350 --> 04:51:36.360 align:start position:0%
for the next presenter to come forward
 
04:51:38.330 --> 04:51:38.340 align:start position:0%
and that's Kristen Coke from the
 
04:51:40.550 --> 04:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
business and industry Association thank
 
04:51:41.990 --> 04:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman it's been a pleasure
 
04:51:43.850 --> 04:51:43.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:51:50.510 --> 04:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:52.788 --> 04:51:52.798 align:start position:0%
oh Kristen I've known a lot of people
 
04:51:56.448 --> 04:51:56.458 align:start position:0%
who had the last name Koch in my
 
04:51:58.190 --> 04:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
lifetime some people pronounce it Coke
 
04:52:00.470 --> 04:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
some people pronounce it Koch what's
 
04:52:02.810 --> 04:52:02.820 align:start position:0%
your preferred pronunciation I pronounce
 
04:52:05.628 --> 04:52:05.638 align:start position:0%
it Koch Koch okay thank you I apologize
 
04:52:08.208 --> 04:52:08.218 align:start position:0%
for missing that the first time oh
 
04:52:09.770 --> 04:52:09.780 align:start position:0%
that's okay well if you ask my German
 
04:52:11.090 --> 04:52:11.100 align:start position:0%
relative they would pronounce it
 
04:52:13.610 --> 04:52:13.620 align:start position:0%
differently too okay
 
04:52:16.070 --> 04:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you
 
04:52:17.628 --> 04:52:17.638 align:start position:0%
um so for the record my name is Kirsten
 
04:52:19.430 --> 04:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
Koch director of public policy for the
 
04:52:21.350 --> 04:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
business and industry Association also
 
04:52:24.110 --> 04:52:24.120 align:start position:0%
known as Bia come before you today to
 
04:52:26.390 --> 04:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
register at bia's opposition to House
 
04:52:30.470 --> 04:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
Bill 633 and we oppose this bill for
 
04:52:34.070 --> 04:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
three reasons first reason is because it
 
04:52:35.750 --> 04:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
would constitute an unconstitutional
 
04:52:37.610 --> 04:52:37.620 align:start position:0%
taking of a private company's property
 
04:52:39.830 --> 04:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
without just compensation I think the
 
04:52:41.390 --> 04:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
previous speakers have touched on that
 
04:52:43.788 --> 04:52:43.798 align:start position:0%
and elaborated brilliantly so I will
 
04:52:46.670 --> 04:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
keep it brief our second concern with
 
04:52:49.010 --> 04:52:49.020 align:start position:0%
the bill is that it directs the Attorney
 
04:52:50.990 --> 04:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
General to take legal action against a
 
04:52:52.550 --> 04:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
specifically named private company
 
04:52:54.708 --> 04:52:54.718 align:start position:0%
that's in good standing in the state of
 
04:52:56.628 --> 04:52:56.638 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and we believe this bill
 
04:52:58.490 --> 04:52:58.500 align:start position:0%
is a deliberate attempt to intervene the
 
04:53:00.650 --> 04:53:00.660 align:start position:0%
judicial process it sets this Broad and
 
04:53:02.510 --> 04:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
damaging precedent undermining the
 
04:53:04.208 --> 04:53:04.218 align:start position:0%
rights and Liberties of New Hampshire
 
04:53:06.470 --> 04:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
businesses it's really a red flag for
 
04:53:08.510 --> 04:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
the business community that you know a
 
04:53:10.490 --> 04:53:10.500 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation can just direct
 
04:53:14.030 --> 04:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
judicial action and our third concern
 
04:53:16.910 --> 04:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
is that mandating a customer cat for an
 
04:53:19.250 --> 04:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
electric Distribution Company would not
 
04:53:22.190 --> 04:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily lower costs for ratepayers
 
04:53:23.750 --> 04:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
um you know each utility has their own
 
04:53:25.430 --> 04:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
designated Service Company they don't
 
04:53:27.110 --> 04:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
compete with each other in this way so
 
04:53:29.390 --> 04:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
there's no evidence that a greater
 
04:53:30.890 --> 04:53:30.900 align:start position:0%
number of smaller utilities would
 
04:53:32.930 --> 04:53:32.940 align:start position:0%
necessarily lower cost for rate payers
 
04:53:35.208 --> 04:53:35.218 align:start position:0%
we would respectfully ask the committee
 
04:53:39.110 --> 04:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
to find House Bill 633 in expedient to
 
04:53:41.510 --> 04:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
legislate as a tier so thank you and I'd
 
04:53:43.730 --> 04:53:43.740 align:start position:0%
be happy to try to answer any questions
 
04:53:50.868 --> 04:53:50.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:52.788 --> 04:53:52.798 align:start position:0%
seeing none I thank you for uh
 
04:53:55.490 --> 04:53:55.500 align:start position:0%
presenting us with your testimony thank
 
04:53:55.500 --> 04:53:56.208 align:start position:0%
presenting us with your testimony thank
you

04:53:56.208 --> 04:53:56.218 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:53:57.948 --> 04:53:57.958 align:start position:0%
and thank you for providing written
 
04:54:00.590 --> 04:54:00.600 align:start position:0%
testimony as well appreciate that
 
04:54:03.288 --> 04:54:03.298 align:start position:0%
next up I'll call on
 
04:54:05.690 --> 04:54:05.700 align:start position:0%
Wendy hunt from the Nashua Chamber of
 
04:54:09.890 --> 04:54:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:12.948 --> 04:54:12.958 align:start position:0%
she had to step away so
 
04:54:14.930 --> 04:54:14.940 align:start position:0%
we'll hold on to that one for a second
 
04:54:17.930 --> 04:54:17.940 align:start position:0%
she did submit written testimony each of
 
04:54:19.490 --> 04:54:19.500 align:start position:0%
you should have a copy of her written
 
04:54:19.500 --> 04:54:20.868 align:start position:0%
you should have a copy of her written
testimony

04:54:20.868 --> 04:54:20.878 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
04:54:24.050 --> 04:54:24.060 align:start position:0%
no no that's her she gave us one from
 
04:54:26.990 --> 04:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
Manchester and Nashua and in
 
04:54:27.000 --> 04:54:29.810 align:start position:0%
Manchester and Nashua and in
first

04:54:29.810 --> 04:54:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:32.510 --> 04:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
well she represents the Nashua chamber
 
04:54:34.788 --> 04:54:34.798 align:start position:0%
is this not her her testimony then from
 
04:54:40.448 --> 04:54:40.458 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:42.470 --> 04:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
she signed it
 
04:54:45.110 --> 04:54:45.120 align:start position:0%
she's the president and CEO
 
04:54:45.120 --> 04:54:46.190 align:start position:0%
she's the president and CEO
so

04:54:46.190 --> 04:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:54:46.200 --> 04:54:47.270 align:start position:0%
so
okay

04:54:47.270 --> 04:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:54:49.448 --> 04:54:49.458 align:start position:0%
all right we got that
 
04:54:53.030 --> 04:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
so next up is Bill Hall from Durham
 
04:54:55.010 --> 04:54:55.020 align:start position:0%
who's representing himself and he
 
04:55:01.368 --> 04:55:01.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:01.378 --> 04:55:03.708 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:55:03.708 --> 04:55:03.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:55:05.390 --> 04:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
and we recognize
 
04:55:07.190 --> 04:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
German boss
 
04:55:07.200 --> 04:55:09.110 align:start position:0%
German boss
um

04:55:09.110 --> 04:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:11.208 --> 04:55:11.218 align:start position:0%
I do
 
04:55:11.218 --> 04:55:12.470 align:start position:0%
I do
okay

04:55:12.470 --> 04:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:55:15.230 --> 04:55:15.240 align:start position:0%
um yes I posed the bill for many of the
 
04:55:17.868 --> 04:55:17.878 align:start position:0%
reasons stated here today and so I won't
 
04:55:20.628 --> 04:55:20.638 align:start position:0%
go into them uh one thing I did observe
 
04:55:22.690 --> 04:55:22.700 align:start position:0%
after being an electrician for 40 years
 
04:55:26.448 --> 04:55:26.458 align:start position:0%
uh the meters have a number of roles and
 
04:55:27.590 --> 04:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
it's very important for the power
 
04:55:30.288 --> 04:55:30.298 align:start position:0%
company to own all for a power company
 
04:55:32.690 --> 04:55:32.700 align:start position:0%
to own the meter own the socket and own
 
04:55:35.150 --> 04:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
the wire down to it you'll sometimes see
 
04:55:37.910 --> 04:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
multimeter places where there's a
 
04:55:39.590 --> 04:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
stainless steel ring around the meter
 
04:55:43.010 --> 04:55:43.020 align:start position:0%
with a special lock there are all kinds
 
04:55:45.590 --> 04:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
of reasons administrative reasons for
 
04:55:47.810 --> 04:55:47.820 align:start position:0%
that I didn't want to get into that
 
04:55:50.628 --> 04:55:50.638 align:start position:0%
though uh I'm going in a slightly
 
04:55:53.868 --> 04:55:53.878 align:start position:0%
different direction and uh and I'll I'll
 
04:55:55.448 --> 04:55:55.458 align:start position:0%
try to be very brief
 
04:55:58.190 --> 04:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
uh all of the things that have been
 
04:55:59.448 --> 04:55:59.458 align:start position:0%
discussed here
 
04:56:02.510 --> 04:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
are on one side of the issue
 
04:56:04.610 --> 04:56:04.620 align:start position:0%
there's another side of the issue of
 
04:56:06.470 --> 04:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
getting the power here
 
04:56:11.510 --> 04:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
and this last summer uh the uh
 
04:56:14.510 --> 04:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
uh governors of all the New England
 
04:56:18.410 --> 04:56:18.420 align:start position:0%
states all six of them had a meeting
 
04:56:22.730 --> 04:56:22.740 align:start position:0%
and they came up with two pages and a
 
04:56:25.368 --> 04:56:25.378 align:start position:0%
half two pages of recommendations
 
04:56:27.470 --> 04:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
and they sent it to the Secretary of
 
04:56:31.070 --> 04:56:31.080 align:start position:0%
Energy with all their signatures and a
 
04:56:33.050 --> 04:56:33.060 align:start position:0%
couple of points about how to keep the
 
04:56:35.270 --> 04:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
prices low now this one they saw this
 
04:56:38.090 --> 04:56:38.100 align:start position:0%
coming this this is dated July
 
04:56:40.190 --> 04:56:40.200 align:start position:0%
they got back a return from the
 
04:56:41.868 --> 04:56:41.878 align:start position:0%
Secretary of Energy
 
04:56:41.878 --> 04:56:43.250 align:start position:0%
Secretary of Energy
uh

04:56:43.250 --> 04:56:43.260 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:56:45.170 --> 04:56:45.180 align:start position:0%
which is uh
 
04:56:47.270 --> 04:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
in my opinion two and a half pages of
 
04:56:49.368 --> 04:56:49.378 align:start position:0%
nonsense they have no intention of
 
04:56:52.788 --> 04:56:52.798 align:start position:0%
helping us whatsoever and I defy you in
 
04:56:55.730 --> 04:56:55.740 align:start position:0%
the last six months to point out how
 
04:57:00.530 --> 04:57:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:02.510 --> 04:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
the result of that letter
 
04:57:05.448 --> 04:57:05.458 align:start position:0%
uh on October 27th
 
04:57:07.430 --> 04:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
eversource sent a letter
 
04:57:10.128 --> 04:57:10.138 align:start position:0%
uh the head of eversource for New
 
04:57:10.138 --> 04:57:12.708 align:start position:0%
uh the head of eversource for New
England

04:57:12.708 --> 04:57:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:14.628 --> 04:57:14.638 align:start position:0%
a very good letter
 
04:57:16.610 --> 04:57:16.620 align:start position:0%
and in it
 
04:57:19.368 --> 04:57:19.378 align:start position:0%
he describes how to keep the electric
 
04:57:22.010 --> 04:57:22.020 align:start position:0%
rates down none of this nonsense between
 
04:57:23.570 --> 04:57:23.580 align:start position:0%
how they
 
04:57:26.090 --> 04:57:26.100 align:start position:0%
how they bid it or anything else which
 
04:57:28.070 --> 04:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
is very important and some of the things
 
04:57:30.708 --> 04:57:30.718 align:start position:0%
that were said here have have
 
04:57:33.288 --> 04:57:33.298 align:start position:0%
really have to be borne out really have
 
04:57:37.010 --> 04:57:37.020 align:start position:0%
to take a look at but what Nolan said
 
04:57:40.610 --> 04:57:40.620 align:start position:0%
was four bullet points this one on page
 
04:57:40.620 --> 04:57:44.030 align:start position:0%
was four bullet points this one on page
two

04:57:44.030 --> 04:57:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:48.410 --> 04:57:48.420 align:start position:0%
three more bullet points on page three
 
04:57:50.090 --> 04:57:50.100 align:start position:0%
he sent it to the president of the
 
04:57:51.830 --> 04:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
United States
 
04:57:57.288 --> 04:57:57.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:00.890 --> 04:58:00.900 align:start position:0%
every single legislator in this state
 
04:58:04.070 --> 04:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
should be demanding action on this the
 
04:58:07.070 --> 04:58:07.080 align:start position:0%
other five states and our delegation as
 
04:58:08.750 --> 04:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
far as I can tell our delegation in
 
04:58:11.208 --> 04:58:11.218 align:start position:0%
Washington hasn't lifted a finger to
 
04:58:13.190 --> 04:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
help the people that elected him well
 
04:58:14.990 --> 04:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
the people that pay for these rates with
 
04:58:17.750 --> 04:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
their wallet in their back pocket
 
04:58:19.730 --> 04:58:19.740 align:start position:0%
oh and by the way
 
04:58:21.530 --> 04:58:21.540 align:start position:0%
we've got to take this seriously because
 
04:58:23.510 --> 04:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
remember the legislator four years ago
 
04:58:26.628 --> 04:58:26.638 align:start position:0%
legislature four years ago bankrupted
 
04:58:29.628 --> 04:58:29.638 align:start position:0%
the power cut public service over the
 
04:58:31.430 --> 04:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
Seabrook Nuclear Plant
 
04:58:33.830 --> 04:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
notice to see the nuclear pad has been
 
04:58:36.110 --> 04:58:36.120 align:start position:0%
the most productive plant of any nuclear
 
04:58:38.810 --> 04:58:38.820 align:start position:0%
plant in this country probably the world
 
04:58:41.750 --> 04:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
two it costs twice as much because we
 
04:58:44.090 --> 04:58:44.100 align:start position:0%
got one plant but we paid for two all
 
04:58:45.650 --> 04:58:45.660 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure for the second plant
 
04:58:47.990 --> 04:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
and all the equipment showed up in
 
04:58:50.448 --> 04:58:50.458 align:start position:0%
Seabrook we just didn't put it all
 
04:58:52.670 --> 04:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
together and get power from it so our
 
04:58:55.010 --> 04:58:55.020 align:start position:0%
electric rates went to the highest in
 
04:58:57.410 --> 04:58:57.420 align:start position:0%
not only New England but all of the
 
04:58:59.150 --> 04:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
associated States particularly Long
 
04:59:04.250 --> 04:59:04.260 align:start position:0%
Island New York and um uh it was a
 
04:59:06.948 --> 04:59:06.958 align:start position:0%
rather painful experience and so I don't
 
04:59:08.690 --> 04:59:08.700 align:start position:0%
want to see the legislature going down
 
04:59:10.850 --> 04:59:10.860 align:start position:0%
the road of where they're going to start
 
04:59:13.730 --> 04:59:13.740 align:start position:0%
doing things that could be uh not in the
 
04:59:15.350 --> 04:59:15.360 align:start position:0%
best interest Public Service one last
 
04:59:15.360 --> 04:59:16.128 align:start position:0%
best interest Public Service one last
thing

04:59:16.128 --> 04:59:16.138 align:start position:0%
thing
 
04:59:19.730 --> 04:59:19.740 align:start position:0%
uh in my area uh public service has done
 
04:59:22.250 --> 04:59:22.260 align:start position:0%
a wonderful job of upgrading their lines
 
04:59:25.390 --> 04:59:25.400 align:start position:0%
putting in Hendrick's cable the TR the
 
04:59:28.670 --> 04:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
transformer in Madbury the lines to it
 
04:59:31.730 --> 04:59:31.740 align:start position:0%
they've done a lot of work the one thing
 
04:59:34.430 --> 04:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
that needs some attention possibly
 
04:59:36.288 --> 04:59:36.298 align:start position:0%
legislative attention
 
04:59:39.350 --> 04:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
is to make sure that towns are not
 
04:59:42.470 --> 04:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
difficult in about the trimming
 
04:59:44.990 --> 04:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
the power company has to go on Scenic
 
04:59:47.510 --> 04:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
roads has to go to the planning board
 
04:59:50.030 --> 04:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
which they did in Durham a friend of
 
04:59:53.208 --> 04:59:53.218 align:start position:0%
mine in Durham Point who was 80 uh 90
 
04:59:55.730 --> 04:59:55.740 align:start position:0%
excuse me and I went and we got a
 
04:59:57.410 --> 04:59:57.420 align:start position:0%
unanimous vote out of the out of the
 
05:00:00.650 --> 05:00:00.660 align:start position:0%
planning board to cut do the The Cutting
 
05:00:02.810 --> 05:00:02.820 align:start position:0%
on Durham Point Road they started
 
05:00:04.970 --> 05:00:04.980 align:start position:0%
cutting the administrator unilaterally
 
05:00:06.650 --> 05:00:06.660 align:start position:0%
sent him home he doesn't have the
 
05:00:08.510 --> 05:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
authority to do that that's State
 
05:00:11.150 --> 05:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
Statute that's by the planning board uh
 
05:00:13.970 --> 05:00:13.980 align:start position:0%
recently he was on channel nine and uh
 
05:00:16.430 --> 05:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
uh there were he said there were 50 line
 
05:00:18.110 --> 05:00:18.120 align:start position:0%
trucks in Durham and half the town was
 
05:00:20.330 --> 05:00:20.340 align:start position:0%
without power because the branches were
 
05:00:22.910 --> 05:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
coming down on the wires so that is an
 
05:00:24.410 --> 05:00:24.420 align:start position:0%
area that needs attention the power
 
05:00:28.610 --> 05:00:28.620 align:start position:0%
company has has now spending 50 000 50
 
05:00:30.410 --> 05:00:30.420 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year and a hundred
 
05:00:32.030 --> 05:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
tree Crews to try to keep this from
 
05:00:34.250 --> 05:00:34.260 align:start position:0%
happening if they start getting hit
 
05:00:36.890 --> 05:00:36.900 align:start position:0%
financially these are the things that
 
05:00:39.110 --> 05:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
are going to be hurt was the trimming
 
05:00:41.570 --> 05:00:41.580 align:start position:0%
and the upgrades
 
05:00:43.730 --> 05:00:43.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Voss
 
05:00:45.530 --> 05:00:45.540 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your testimony Mr
 
05:00:47.090 --> 05:00:47.100 align:start position:0%

that by Miss Wendy hunt but apparently
 
05:01:05.448 --> 05:01:05.458 align:start position:0%
she's not going to make it back so we're
 
05:01:07.070 --> 05:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
going to uh
 
05:01:09.170 --> 05:01:09.180 align:start position:0%
forego her
 
05:01:11.330 --> 05:01:11.340 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak is there anyone
 
05:01:14.390 --> 05:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
else who is in the audience who has not
 
05:01:16.070 --> 05:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
had a chance to speak who would like to
 
05:01:19.190 --> 05:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:20.990 --> 05:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'm going to close the
 
05:01:23.810 --> 05:01:23.820 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 633 and ask
 
05:01:26.570 --> 05:01:26.580 align:start position:0%
representative closure to give us a
 
05:01:29.690 --> 05:01:29.700 align:start position:0%
report on the blue sheet
 
05:01:32.448 --> 05:01:32.458 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Bulls
 
05:01:33.788 --> 05:01:33.798 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
05:01:37.010 --> 05:01:37.020 align:start position:0%
633 FN
 
05:01:39.170 --> 05:01:39.180 align:start position:0%
blue sheet was
 
05:01:41.270 --> 05:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
none in favor
 
05:01:43.070 --> 05:01:43.080 align:start position:0%
for opposed
 
05:01:43.080 --> 05:01:44.690 align:start position:0%
for opposed
online

05:01:44.690 --> 05:01:44.700 align:start position:0%
online
 
05:01:47.350 --> 05:01:47.360 align:start position:0%
it was 33 in support
 
05:01:50.868 --> 05:01:50.878 align:start position:0%
59 opposed one neutral
 
05:01:53.448 --> 05:01:53.458 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:01:56.090 --> 05:01:56.100 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so let me get a sense
 
05:01:57.708 --> 05:01:57.718 align:start position:0%
from the committee how many people would
 
05:01:59.390 --> 05:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
like to take a break so you can go get
 
05:02:04.190 --> 05:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:07.970 --> 05:02:07.980 align:start position:0%
three okay I will open the public
 
05:02:12.350 --> 05:02:12.360 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 139 and
 
05:02:16.250 --> 05:02:16.260 align:start position:0%
call a break for 15 minutes
 
05:02:18.170 --> 05:02:18.180 align:start position:0%
I think that would be enough
 
05:02:20.110 --> 05:02:20.120 align:start position:0%
to run fast okay
 
05:02:22.490 --> 05:02:22.500 align:start position:0%
you'd be better off to run anyway
 
05:02:24.530 --> 05:02:24.540 align:start position:0%
because you can generate some heat that
 
05:02:24.540 --> 05:02:25.570 align:start position:0%
because you can generate some heat that
way

05:02:25.570 --> 05:02:25.580 align:start position:0%
way
 
05:18:59.208 --> 05:18:59.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:19.970 --> 05:20:19.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:22.610 --> 05:20:22.620 align:start position:0%
all right I'd like to resume the public
 
05:20:26.270 --> 05:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB 139 and I would like to
 
05:20:28.910 --> 05:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
introduce representative Thomas Corman
 
05:20:31.430 --> 05:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
who will introduce the bill for the
 
05:20:34.330 --> 05:20:34.340 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor representative Jackie
 
05:20:38.590 --> 05:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
cretienne who is still recovering from
 
05:20:41.990 --> 05:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh a broken ankle I suspect so
 
05:20:43.670 --> 05:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
representative Corman please introduce
 
05:20:46.850 --> 05:20:46.860 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank you Mr chairman for the
 
05:20:49.070 --> 05:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
record I am Thomas Corman a
 
05:20:50.930 --> 05:20:50.940 align:start position:0%
representative from
 
05:20:54.770 --> 05:20:54.780 align:start position:0%
Grafton 15 which is Ward 3 of the city
 
05:20:57.770 --> 05:20:57.780 align:start position:0%
of Lebanon and yes I am filling in for
 
05:20:59.990 --> 05:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative cretian who unfortunately
 
05:21:02.208 --> 05:21:02.218 align:start position:0%
can't be here
 
05:21:07.070 --> 05:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
so this is about HB 139 this is a bill
 
05:21:11.208 --> 05:21:11.218 align:start position:0%
intended to address oversights in HB 315
 
05:21:15.368 --> 05:21:15.378 align:start position:0%
from last session amending RSA
 
05:21:18.650 --> 05:21:18.660 align:start position:0%
362-a specifically section 1A
 
05:21:21.350 --> 05:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
and there are two changes that this bill
 
05:21:22.430 --> 05:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
would do
 
05:21:25.990 --> 05:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
the first is allowing neighboring
 
05:21:29.270 --> 05:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities to share projects under
 
05:21:33.410 --> 05:21:33.420 align:start position:0%
net metering so that if two towns or
 
05:21:35.930 --> 05:21:35.940 align:start position:0%
more than two towns or municipalities
 
05:21:38.810 --> 05:21:38.820 align:start position:0%
wish to collaborate on a project that
 
05:21:42.050 --> 05:21:42.060 align:start position:0%
has net metering they can you can
 
05:21:44.628 --> 05:21:44.638 align:start position:0%
imagine a situation where you have a
 
05:21:46.670 --> 05:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
large municipality that would have a
 
05:21:48.770 --> 05:21:48.780 align:start position:0%
high electric load but maybe little
 
05:21:50.690 --> 05:21:50.700 align:start position:0%
space in which to put something like a
 
05:21:52.070 --> 05:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
solar array
 
05:21:54.050 --> 05:21:54.060 align:start position:0%
we wants to put one and there's a
 
05:21:57.050 --> 05:21:57.060 align:start position:0%
neighboring municipality with a lower
 
05:21:59.270 --> 05:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
population a lower load but has space
 
05:22:01.448 --> 05:22:01.458 align:start position:0%
the idea is that they could actually
 
05:22:05.930 --> 05:22:05.940 align:start position:0%
combine forces and have uh be one
 
05:22:09.110 --> 05:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
Municipal host together
 
05:22:12.530 --> 05:22:12.540 align:start position:0%
uh the bill also clarifies that the
 
05:22:15.350 --> 05:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
entire State of New Hampshire housing
 
05:22:18.470 --> 05:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
authorities peas and quasi-public
 
05:22:20.628 --> 05:22:20.638 align:start position:0%
entities such as public colleges
 
05:22:23.570 --> 05:22:23.580 align:start position:0%
universities or community colleges are
 
05:22:26.270 --> 05:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
considered political subdivisions for
 
05:22:28.730 --> 05:22:28.740 align:start position:0%
the purpose of eligibility for these net
 
05:22:31.310 --> 05:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
metered energy projects under the five
 
05:22:32.930 --> 05:22:32.940 align:start position:0%
megawatt cap
 
05:22:35.390 --> 05:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
now it turns out that a bill clarifying
 
05:22:37.850 --> 05:22:37.860 align:start position:0%
what a municipal host is was introduced
 
05:22:42.050 --> 05:22:42.060 align:start position:0%
last session is SB 259 it was bipartisan
 
05:22:44.208 --> 05:22:44.218 align:start position:0%
in both the House and Senate it had 11
 
05:22:46.368 --> 05:22:46.378 align:start position:0%
Senate sponsors the primary Senate
 
05:22:48.770 --> 05:22:48.780 align:start position:0%
sponsor was a republican uh and it
 
05:22:51.470 --> 05:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
passed the Senate there was an interim
 
05:22:54.350 --> 05:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
study and somehow it died after that I
 
05:22:55.610 --> 05:22:55.620 align:start position:0%
wasn't here so I don't know the
 
05:22:57.670 --> 05:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
particulars of it
 
05:23:00.830 --> 05:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
that's really all I have to say but I
 
05:23:03.948 --> 05:23:03.958 align:start position:0%
also want to head off one question that
 
05:23:07.128 --> 05:23:07.138 align:start position:0%
might come up which is when we look at
 
05:23:09.650 --> 05:23:09.660 align:start position:0%
the bill what the bill is doing is it's
 
05:23:12.170 --> 05:23:12.180 align:start position:0%
striking text in lines six seven and
 
05:23:13.810 --> 05:23:13.820 align:start position:0%
eight this this
 
05:23:16.448 --> 05:23:16.458 align:start position:0%
parenthetical line a municipal host
 
05:23:18.470 --> 05:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
shall be located in the same
 
05:23:21.050 --> 05:23:21.060 align:start position:0%
municipality as all group members if the
 
05:23:23.330 --> 05:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
facility began operation after January 1
 
05:23:26.150 --> 05:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
2021 and I actually asked representative
 
05:23:28.128 --> 05:23:28.138 align:start position:0%
cretian you know do you know why that
 
05:23:31.850 --> 05:23:31.860 align:start position:0%
was in there and she did not and I don't
 
05:23:33.590 --> 05:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
I don't know why that would have been in
 
05:23:35.448 --> 05:23:35.458 align:start position:0%
there but it seems like it makes sense
 
05:23:39.350 --> 05:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
to remove it and with that I'm ready to
 
05:23:42.410 --> 05:23:42.420 align:start position:0%
attempt to answer questions
 
05:23:45.288 --> 05:23:45.298 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi will
 
05:23:47.030 --> 05:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
give you a question
 
05:23:49.670 --> 05:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
so you can attempt to answer it
 
05:23:51.708 --> 05:23:51.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:23:55.190 --> 05:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
um so this bill I think suffers from one
 
05:23:58.390 --> 05:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
of the same questions I had last year is
 
05:24:01.910 --> 05:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
defining what a qualified Housing
 
05:24:03.708 --> 05:24:03.718 align:start position:0%
Authority is because that could be
 
05:24:06.230 --> 05:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
almost anything and even more broadly
 
05:24:08.930 --> 05:24:08.940 align:start position:0%
what is a quasi-public entity I think
 
05:24:12.110 --> 05:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
these terms being undefined is a major
 
05:24:14.288 --> 05:24:14.298 align:start position:0%
defect in this bill and I like
 
05:24:16.070 --> 05:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
explanation of
 
05:24:18.110 --> 05:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
how we deal with that
 
05:24:20.628 --> 05:24:20.638 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bernardi so as
 
05:24:23.030 --> 05:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
I mentioned uh examples of quasi-public
 
05:24:24.530 --> 05:24:24.540 align:start position:0%
entities would be things like public
 
05:24:26.990 --> 05:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
colleges universities community colleges
 
05:24:31.970 --> 05:24:31.980 align:start position:0%
so entities that are run under the Aegis
 
05:24:35.270 --> 05:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
of some Public Authority but aren't
 
05:24:39.050 --> 05:24:39.060 align:start position:0%
necessarily a city or a town or an
 
05:24:41.448 --> 05:24:41.458 align:start position:0%
agency thereof
 
05:24:43.190 --> 05:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
05:24:47.030 --> 05:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
follow up so I agreed a lot last year
 
05:24:49.930 --> 05:24:49.940 align:start position:0%
that was a similar comment yet
 
05:24:52.430 --> 05:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
definitionally it was not in the
 
05:24:55.690 --> 05:24:55.700 align:start position:0%
proposal and therefore legally
 
05:24:58.550 --> 05:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
someone trying to apply this law could
 
05:25:00.890 --> 05:25:00.900 align:start position:0%
come up with their own definition of
 
05:25:02.690 --> 05:25:02.700 align:start position:0%
whatever they thought these were so that
 
05:25:04.910 --> 05:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
I I see that as a defect how would you
 
05:25:06.890 --> 05:25:06.900 align:start position:0%
correct this thank you
 
05:25:08.690 --> 05:25:08.700 align:start position:0%
um I'll make note of that for possible
 
05:25:10.250 --> 05:25:10.260 align:start position:0%
amendment I would discuss it with
 
05:25:12.470 --> 05:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
representative cretian
 
05:25:14.448 --> 05:25:14.458 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:25:16.970 --> 05:25:16.980 align:start position:0%
further questions for representative
 
05:25:16.980 --> 05:25:18.230 align:start position:0%
further questions for representative
Corman

05:25:18.230 --> 05:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
Corman
 
05:25:20.390 --> 05:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
05:25:22.910 --> 05:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
question thank you um you just
 
05:25:26.270 --> 05:25:26.280 align:start position:0%
definitely defined quasi-public do you
 
05:25:28.490 --> 05:25:28.500 align:start position:0%
have a definition for Housing Authority
 
05:25:30.410 --> 05:25:30.420 align:start position:0%
do I have a definition for Housing
 
05:25:32.930 --> 05:25:32.940 align:start position:0%
Authority I do not okay um that's not
 
05:25:35.390 --> 05:25:35.400 align:start position:0%
really my area of expertise
 
05:25:39.190 --> 05:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:43.070 --> 05:25:43.080 align:start position:0%

05:26:36.288 --> 05:26:36.298 align:start position:0%
while everyone is availing themselves of
 
05:26:36.298 --> 05:26:37.670 align:start position:0%
while everyone is availing themselves of
the

05:26:37.670 --> 05:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:26:37.680 --> 05:26:38.868 align:start position:0%
the
um

05:26:38.868 --> 05:26:38.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:41.390 --> 05:26:41.400 align:start position:0%
hot chocolate
 
05:26:43.788 --> 05:26:43.798 align:start position:0%
I will just mention that you
 
05:26:47.030 --> 05:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
representative Corbin Corman questioned
 
05:26:49.250 --> 05:26:49.260 align:start position:0%
the parenthetical
 
05:26:54.350 --> 05:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:57.830 --> 05:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
the the phrase was subsequently stricken
 
05:27:00.830 --> 05:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
by this by this proposed legislation the
 
05:27:02.690 --> 05:27:02.700 align:start position:0%
reason it was put in there was to
 
05:27:08.750 --> 05:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
prevent and uh expansion of
 
05:27:12.110 --> 05:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
uh net metering facilities across the
 
05:27:12.120 --> 05:27:13.250 align:start position:0%
uh net metering facilities across the
state

05:27:13.250 --> 05:27:13.260 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:27:13.260 --> 05:27:16.368 align:start position:0%
state
um

05:27:16.368 --> 05:27:16.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:18.410 --> 05:27:18.420 align:start position:0%
it was felt at the time that the that
 
05:27:20.270 --> 05:27:20.280 align:start position:0%
the legislation was originally written
 
05:27:20.280 --> 05:27:22.550 align:start position:0%
the legislation was originally written
that

05:27:22.550 --> 05:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:27:25.190 --> 05:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
the expansion of net metering needs to
 
05:27:27.708 --> 05:27:27.718 align:start position:0%
be very carefully managed
 
05:27:31.270 --> 05:27:31.280 align:start position:0%
and by allowing
 
05:27:35.270 --> 05:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities to cross Municipal lines
 
05:27:37.788 --> 05:27:37.798 align:start position:0%
it could accelerate the expansion of net
 
05:27:39.708 --> 05:27:39.718 align:start position:0%
metering too quickly
 
05:27:42.288 --> 05:27:42.298 align:start position:0%
which would be detrimental to ratepayers
 
05:27:43.970 --> 05:27:43.980 align:start position:0%
long term so that's the reason it was
 
05:27:46.490 --> 05:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
put into the legislation to begin with
 
05:27:48.288 --> 05:27:48.298 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Bose I would note
 
05:27:50.090 --> 05:27:50.100 align:start position:0%
though of course that there's still the
 
05:27:53.930 --> 05:27:53.940 align:start position:0%
five megawatt cap per Municipal host
 
05:27:59.090 --> 05:27:59.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:00.890 --> 05:28:00.900 align:start position:0%
maybe I didn't unders explain it
 
05:28:02.930 --> 05:28:02.940 align:start position:0%
adequately so yes there is a five
 
05:28:05.090 --> 05:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
megawatt cap
 
05:28:09.830 --> 05:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
but by restricting it to
 
05:28:12.110 --> 05:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
the municipal host to the single
 
05:28:15.770 --> 05:28:15.780 align:start position:0%
municipality it would restrict the
 
05:28:18.050 --> 05:28:18.060 align:start position:0%
number of towns that could expand to
 
05:28:20.628 --> 05:28:20.638 align:start position:0%
five megawatts so in that way it
 
05:28:24.530 --> 05:28:24.540 align:start position:0%
prevents a rapid proliferation of net
 
05:28:24.540 --> 05:28:26.628 align:start position:0%
prevents a rapid proliferation of net
metering

05:28:26.628 --> 05:28:26.638 align:start position:0%
metering
 
05:28:30.288 --> 05:28:30.298 align:start position:0%
which could be detrimental to rate bears
 
05:28:33.050 --> 05:28:33.060 align:start position:0%
okay do we have any further questions
 
05:28:36.830 --> 05:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
um if I may yeah um it's unclear
 
05:28:39.350 --> 05:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
entirely how how detrimental net
 
05:28:41.810 --> 05:28:41.820 align:start position:0%
metering is to rate payers there are
 
05:28:43.670 --> 05:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
certainly some places where where it's
 
05:28:46.190 --> 05:28:46.200 align:start position:0%
an advantage in that it's the the
 
05:28:48.110 --> 05:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
electricity is now being produced closer
 
05:28:50.570 --> 05:28:50.580 align:start position:0%
to where it's being used and that cuts
 
05:28:52.550 --> 05:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
down distribution and transmission costs
 
05:28:54.288 --> 05:28:54.298 align:start position:0%
and of course we're all interested in
 
05:28:56.448 --> 05:28:56.458 align:start position:0%
having the electricity produced as
 
05:28:58.550 --> 05:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
locally as possible
 
05:29:01.128 --> 05:29:01.138 align:start position:0%
well they recently completed value of
 
05:29:03.288 --> 05:29:03.298 align:start position:0%
distributed energy resources study
 
05:29:06.890 --> 05:29:06.900 align:start position:0%
indicated that 1 to 1.5 percent of costs
 
05:29:09.948 --> 05:29:09.958 align:start position:0%
for net metering are shifted to non-net
 
05:29:12.470 --> 05:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
metering customers and other Studies
 
05:29:15.650 --> 05:29:15.660 align:start position:0%
have shown that that relatively low
 
05:29:19.128 --> 05:29:19.138 align:start position:0%
percentage is the direct result of a
 
05:29:21.770 --> 05:29:21.780 align:start position:0%
relatively low penetration of solar
 
05:29:27.230 --> 05:29:27.240 align:start position:0%
within the electricity Marketplace as
 
05:29:27.240 --> 05:29:28.250 align:start position:0%
within the electricity Marketplace as
that

05:29:28.250 --> 05:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:29:31.850 --> 05:29:31.860 align:start position:0%
penetration grows so does the percentage
 
05:29:33.410 --> 05:29:33.420 align:start position:0%
of cost shifting
 
05:29:36.110 --> 05:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
and some Studies have shown that for
 
05:29:38.750 --> 05:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
example once solar gets up to be 15 or
 
05:29:41.090 --> 05:29:41.100 align:start position:0%
20 percent penetration in the grid the
 
05:29:44.270 --> 05:29:44.280 align:start position:0%
cost shifting would be comparable and
 
05:29:46.550 --> 05:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
that's a burden that we want to make
 
05:29:49.368 --> 05:29:49.378 align:start position:0%
sure we manage very very carefully so
 
05:29:52.850 --> 05:29:52.860 align:start position:0%
that rate payers are not unduly burdened
 
05:29:54.110 --> 05:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
05:29:56.448 --> 05:29:56.458 align:start position:0%
you have to remember that people at the
 
05:29:58.990 --> 05:29:59.000 align:start position:0%
lowest end of the income scale
 
05:30:03.230 --> 05:30:03.240 align:start position:0%
are hurt more than anybody else by an
 
05:30:05.810 --> 05:30:05.820 align:start position:0%
increasing cost of energy
 
05:30:09.050 --> 05:30:09.060 align:start position:0%
as much as 40 percent of a low-income
 
05:30:09.060 --> 05:30:11.150 align:start position:0%
as much as 40 percent of a low-income
person's

05:30:11.150 --> 05:30:11.160 align:start position:0%
person's
 
05:30:15.410 --> 05:30:15.420 align:start position:0%
income goes to pay for electricity heat
 
05:30:20.390 --> 05:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
and transportation fuel so it's it's
 
05:30:23.750 --> 05:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
incumbent upon us as legislators as we
 
05:30:25.730 --> 05:30:25.740 align:start position:0%
try to deal with these issues to make
 
05:30:28.190 --> 05:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
sure we don't hurt the most vulnerable
 
05:30:31.070 --> 05:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
of our constituents
 
05:30:33.288 --> 05:30:33.298 align:start position:0%
we have to manage the growth of these
 
05:30:37.310 --> 05:30:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:37.320 --> 05:30:38.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:30:38.750 --> 05:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:30:40.190 --> 05:30:40.200 align:start position:0%
so you know further questions for
 
05:30:41.810 --> 05:30:41.820 align:start position:0%
representative Corman
 
05:30:44.570 --> 05:30:44.580 align:start position:0%
I'll call the next
 
05:30:46.070 --> 05:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
person who would like to give us some
 
05:30:48.948 --> 05:30:48.958 align:start position:0%
testimony on this bill and that's the
 
05:30:50.868 --> 05:30:50.878 align:start position:0%
department of Energy's Griffin Roberge
 
05:31:05.230 --> 05:31:05.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:08.330 --> 05:31:08.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
05:31:10.490 --> 05:31:10.500 align:start position:0%
committee Griffin Roberts again from New
 
05:31:11.930 --> 05:31:11.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of energy I'm the
 
05:31:14.330 --> 05:31:14.340 align:start position:0%
state energy program manager the
 
05:31:16.250 --> 05:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
department is respectfully opposed to
 
05:31:20.570 --> 05:31:20.580 align:start position:0%
House Bill 139 as introduced the bill
 
05:31:22.850 --> 05:31:22.860 align:start position:0%
does as uh representative Corman
 
05:31:25.010 --> 05:31:25.020 align:start position:0%
indicated makes changes to the municipal
 
05:31:28.550 --> 05:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
host statute as folks on this committee
 
05:31:29.990 --> 05:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
might know the statute permits a
 
05:31:32.150 --> 05:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
customer generator or a municipal host
 
05:31:34.550 --> 05:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
of more than one megawatt but less than
 
05:31:37.070 --> 05:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
five to serve as a group host for a
 
05:31:38.390 --> 05:31:38.400 align:start position:0%
variety of members that consist
 
05:31:41.650 --> 05:31:41.660 align:start position:0%
exclusively of political subdivisions
 
05:31:44.270 --> 05:31:44.280 align:start position:0%
those political sub the term political
 
05:31:47.270 --> 05:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
subdivision is defined on lines nine to
 
05:31:50.330 --> 05:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
twelve and Municipal hosts themselves
 
05:31:54.288 --> 05:31:54.298 align:start position:0%
may be publicly or privately owned
 
05:31:56.030 --> 05:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
um as I reference political subdivision
 
05:31:58.430 --> 05:31:58.440 align:start position:0%
is defined as the state of New Hampshire
 
05:32:00.770 --> 05:32:00.780 align:start position:0%
or any City Town County School District
 
05:32:04.670 --> 05:32:04.680 align:start position:0%
chartered Public School Etc the statute
 
05:32:07.250 --> 05:32:07.260 align:start position:0%
obviously was created under house bill
 
05:32:12.350 --> 05:32:12.360 align:start position:0%
315 in 2021 and was modified uh by House
 
05:32:15.890 --> 05:32:15.900 align:start position:0%
Bill 1258 last year to include the state
 
05:32:17.628 --> 05:32:17.638 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire as a political
 
05:32:17.638 --> 05:32:19.430 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire as a political
subdivision

05:32:19.430 --> 05:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
subdivision
 
05:32:22.670 --> 05:32:22.680 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 139 proposes to remove
 
05:32:25.310 --> 05:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
language on lines six to eight that
 
05:32:27.530 --> 05:32:27.540 align:start position:0%
require a municipal host to be located
 
05:32:30.410 --> 05:32:30.420 align:start position:0%
in the same municipality as all of its
 
05:32:32.150 --> 05:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
group members if that facility began
 
05:32:35.690 --> 05:32:35.700 align:start position:0%
operation after January 1 of 21.
 
05:32:38.628 --> 05:32:38.638 align:start position:0%
um in essence this change as is proposed
 
05:32:40.550 --> 05:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
in the bill would allow for new
 
05:32:42.770 --> 05:32:42.780 align:start position:0%
constructed uh generation serving as a
 
05:32:44.750 --> 05:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
municipal host to have group members
 
05:32:47.090 --> 05:32:47.100 align:start position:0%
outside of the same municipality as a
 
05:32:48.230 --> 05:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
host so
 
05:32:50.090 --> 05:32:50.100 align:start position:0%
an example you got a three megawatt
 
05:32:53.090 --> 05:32:53.100 align:start position:0%
array in Bow they could potentially uh
 
05:32:55.010 --> 05:32:55.020 align:start position:0%
take on group members in neighboring
 
05:32:56.810 --> 05:32:56.820 align:start position:0%
communities provided obviously that
 
05:32:58.250 --> 05:32:58.260 align:start position:0%
they're all within the same franchise
 
05:32:58.260 --> 05:32:59.810 align:start position:0%
they're all within the same franchise
territory

05:32:59.810 --> 05:32:59.820 align:start position:0%
territory
 
05:33:03.350 --> 05:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
um as we noted on House Bill 161 we do
 
05:33:05.208 --> 05:33:05.218 align:start position:0%
want to stress to policymakers that
 
05:33:08.150 --> 05:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
sizable changes to net metering statute
 
05:33:10.550 --> 05:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
may not be warranted at this time as the
 
05:33:12.530 --> 05:33:12.540 align:start position:0%
puc currently has an ongoing docket
 
05:33:15.250 --> 05:33:15.260 align:start position:0%
under de
 
05:33:15.260 --> 05:33:16.868 align:start position:0%
under de
22-060

05:33:16.868 --> 05:33:16.878 align:start position:0%
22-060
 
05:33:19.430 --> 05:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
to consider changes to the current net
 
05:33:21.110 --> 05:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
metering tariff structure including
 
05:33:24.230 --> 05:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
compensation to customer generators we
 
05:33:26.030 --> 05:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
again would suggest that policy makers
 
05:33:28.250 --> 05:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
let this process and the docket play out
 
05:33:29.868 --> 05:33:29.878 align:start position:0%
through a full adjudication with
 
05:33:31.850 --> 05:33:31.860 align:start position:0%
interested stakeholders before making
 
05:33:33.708 --> 05:33:33.718 align:start position:0%
any substantial changes to the state's
 
05:33:35.770 --> 05:33:35.780 align:start position:0%
net metering statute
 
05:33:38.030 --> 05:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
further down below the bolded language
 
05:33:40.090 --> 05:33:40.100 align:start position:0%
on lines 10 to 11
 
05:33:42.650 --> 05:33:42.660 align:start position:0%
it expands the eligible entities who
 
05:33:43.850 --> 05:33:43.860 align:start position:0%
could be considered political
 
05:33:45.830 --> 05:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
subdivisions or group members again
 
05:33:48.470 --> 05:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
under the statute as it did last year
 
05:33:50.628 --> 05:33:50.638 align:start position:0%
doe does want to express concern with
 
05:33:52.490 --> 05:33:52.500 align:start position:0%
the use of the phrase quasi-public
 
05:33:54.890 --> 05:33:54.900 align:start position:0%
entity the phrase is not defined
 
05:33:56.690 --> 05:33:56.700 align:start position:0%
anywhere in statute and it could
 
05:33:58.788 --> 05:33:58.798 align:start position:0%
certainly present confusion to the
 
05:34:02.050 --> 05:34:02.060 align:start position:0%
department as we review Municipal host
 
05:34:04.310 --> 05:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
applications to the department which we
 
05:34:06.948 --> 05:34:06.958 align:start position:0%
have to approve
 
05:34:08.810 --> 05:34:08.820 align:start position:0%
further Clarity I think would be needed
 
05:34:10.490 --> 05:34:10.500 align:start position:0%
there you know is the entity receiving
 
05:34:12.650 --> 05:34:12.660 align:start position:0%
Public Funding is it privately owned but
 
05:34:14.810 --> 05:34:14.820 align:start position:0%
serving a public purpose
 
05:34:17.270 --> 05:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
um you know in that different parties
 
05:34:18.890 --> 05:34:18.900 align:start position:0%
could make different arguments as to
 
05:34:22.010 --> 05:34:22.020 align:start position:0%
what quasi-public entity means some
 
05:34:23.628 --> 05:34:23.638 align:start position:0%
other considerations is housing
 
05:34:23.638 --> 05:34:24.830 align:start position:0%
other considerations is housing
authorities

05:34:24.830 --> 05:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
authorities
 
05:34:27.948 --> 05:34:27.958 align:start position:0%
um and I I'll I have to fall on the
 
05:34:29.330 --> 05:34:29.340 align:start position:0%
sword here I just did a quick Google
 
05:34:31.850 --> 05:34:31.860 align:start position:0%
search back in the room looking for the
 
05:34:33.770 --> 05:34:33.780 align:start position:0%
number of housing authorities this bill
 
05:34:37.010 --> 05:34:37.020 align:start position:0%
might apply to the number I came to was
 
05:34:40.970 --> 05:34:40.980 align:start position:0%
17 but I may be off on that and then the
 
05:34:43.430 --> 05:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
other thing I wanted to raise is it's my
 
05:34:44.868 --> 05:34:44.878 align:start position:0%
understanding and I certainly welcome
 
05:34:47.030 --> 05:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
any feedback from anybody who lives in
 
05:34:49.368 --> 05:34:49.378 align:start position:0%
the Seacoast area peas Development
 
05:34:51.410 --> 05:34:51.420 align:start position:0%
Authority I believe stretches across the
 
05:34:53.208 --> 05:34:53.218 align:start position:0%
municipal boundaries in both Portsmouth
 
05:34:56.930 --> 05:34:56.940 align:start position:0%
and Newington uh okay
 
05:34:56.940 --> 05:34:58.490 align:start position:0%
and Newington uh okay
noted

05:34:58.490 --> 05:34:58.500 align:start position:0%
noted
 
05:35:01.070 --> 05:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
um so if that's the case obviously if
 
05:35:04.250 --> 05:35:04.260 align:start position:0%
the language on lines six to eight
 
05:35:06.050 --> 05:35:06.060 align:start position:0%
um were to go for the long with peas
 
05:35:07.550 --> 05:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
Development Authority I imagine that
 
05:35:09.310 --> 05:35:09.320 align:start position:0%
there would be an accommodation for
 
05:35:11.810 --> 05:35:11.820 align:start position:0%
municipal uh for political subdivisions
 
05:35:13.190 --> 05:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
to cross those boundaries between
 
05:35:16.430 --> 05:35:16.440 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth and Newington however if line
 
05:35:18.288 --> 05:35:18.298 align:start position:0%
six to eight
 
05:35:20.530 --> 05:35:20.540 align:start position:0%
um that deletion on line six to eight
 
05:35:22.788 --> 05:35:22.798 align:start position:0%
does not occur in peace Development
 
05:35:25.070 --> 05:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
Authority is retained in there that
 
05:35:26.510 --> 05:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
would likely create a little bit of
 
05:35:28.310 --> 05:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
conflict again because you have
 
05:35:30.050 --> 05:35:30.060 align:start position:0%
stretching across Portsmouth and
 
05:35:30.060 --> 05:35:31.430 align:start position:0%
stretching across Portsmouth and
Newington

05:35:31.430 --> 05:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
Newington
 
05:35:31.440 --> 05:35:32.090 align:start position:0%
Newington
um

05:35:32.090 --> 05:35:32.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:35.090 --> 05:35:35.100 align:start position:0%
beyond that that really concludes my
 
05:35:38.330 --> 05:35:38.340 align:start position:0%
testimony oh and for context as I
 
05:35:40.250 --> 05:35:40.260 align:start position:0%
mentioned Municipal hosts need to be
 
05:35:41.270 --> 05:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
registered with the New Hampshire
 
05:35:43.490 --> 05:35:43.500 align:start position:0%
Department of energy since the bill
 
05:35:46.610 --> 05:35:46.620 align:start position:0%
passed there are 10 registered Municipal
 
05:35:48.890 --> 05:35:48.900 align:start position:0%
hosts in the state
 
05:35:50.868 --> 05:35:50.878 align:start position:0%
um and I'm happy to take any questions
 
05:35:53.448 --> 05:35:53.458 align:start position:0%
that folks have
 
05:35:55.310 --> 05:35:55.320 align:start position:0%
excellent testimony questions
 
05:35:57.288 --> 05:35:57.298 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
05:35:59.628 --> 05:35:59.638 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair uh you
 
05:36:02.110 --> 05:36:02.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned that the puc is going to be
 
05:36:05.750 --> 05:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
creating a report or a decision on on on
 
05:36:07.850 --> 05:36:07.860 align:start position:0%
this can you can you tell me when that
 
05:36:09.708 --> 05:36:09.718 align:start position:0%
is expected sure and thank you for the
 
05:36:11.868 --> 05:36:11.878 align:start position:0%
question I believe
 
05:36:11.878 --> 05:36:12.770 align:start position:0%
question I believe
um

05:36:12.770 --> 05:36:12.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:15.288 --> 05:36:15.298 align:start position:0%
I believe
 
05:36:18.110 --> 05:36:18.120 align:start position:0%
um the puc released a an order or a
 
05:36:19.910 --> 05:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
notice the other day kind of outlining
 
05:36:22.910 --> 05:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
their schedule as to
 
05:36:24.948 --> 05:36:24.958 align:start position:0%
um the various events that will occur in
 
05:36:26.570 --> 05:36:26.580 align:start position:0%
their adjudicative proceeding I can
 
05:36:27.830 --> 05:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
certainly follow up with the committee
 
05:36:29.690 --> 05:36:29.700 align:start position:0%
on that I don't recall the dates off the
 
05:36:31.610 --> 05:36:31.620 align:start position:0%
top of my head follow-up
 
05:36:34.070 --> 05:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up but but yet you're you're
 
05:36:35.810 --> 05:36:35.820 align:start position:0%
asking the legislative
 
05:36:35.820 --> 05:36:36.708 align:start position:0%
asking the legislative
um

05:36:36.708 --> 05:36:36.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:39.230 --> 05:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
body to hold off on any kind of a
 
05:36:41.868 --> 05:36:41.878 align:start position:0%
decision or action sure and thank you
 
05:36:43.368 --> 05:36:43.378 align:start position:0%
for the question so
 
05:36:45.288 --> 05:36:45.298 align:start position:0%
um obviously policymakers can do as they
 
05:36:47.868 --> 05:36:47.878 align:start position:0%
wish obviously if uh if committee
 
05:36:49.368 --> 05:36:49.378 align:start position:0%
members or policy makers feel that this
 
05:36:52.010 --> 05:36:52.020 align:start position:0%
bill should go for it as is that is
 
05:36:54.110 --> 05:36:54.120 align:start position:0%
their prerogative obviously it's just we
 
05:36:57.368 --> 05:36:57.378 align:start position:0%
would uh respectfully just urge uh
 
05:36:59.208 --> 05:36:59.218 align:start position:0%
policymakers to consider letting that
 
05:37:01.430 --> 05:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
process play out before making uh
 
05:37:05.530 --> 05:37:05.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:09.170 --> 05:37:09.180 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan has a question
 
05:37:10.910 --> 05:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks for taking Mike uh thank you
 
05:37:11.930 --> 05:37:11.940 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thanks for taking my
 
05:37:11.940 --> 05:37:12.830 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thanks for taking my
question

05:37:12.830 --> 05:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:37:14.570 --> 05:37:14.580 align:start position:0%
um I'm just a little bit curious about
 
05:37:17.208 --> 05:37:17.218 align:start position:0%
the uh the difference between uh the
 
05:37:19.850 --> 05:37:19.860 align:start position:0%
geographic range of of Municipal house
 
05:37:21.650 --> 05:37:21.660 align:start position:0%
and the um
 
05:37:24.170 --> 05:37:24.180 align:start position:0%
the argument that that would
 
05:37:26.330 --> 05:37:26.340 align:start position:0%
that would increase the the penetration
 
05:37:30.410 --> 05:37:30.420 align:start position:0%
of of say solar into our our power
 
05:37:32.390 --> 05:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
system I mean
 
05:37:34.788 --> 05:37:34.798 align:start position:0%
it's how is that possible if it's a five
 
05:37:36.590 --> 05:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
megawatt cap I'm just kind of returning
 
05:37:37.730 --> 05:37:37.740 align:start position:0%
to the point that that the
 
05:37:39.890 --> 05:37:39.900 align:start position:0%
representative was making sure and and
 
05:37:41.810 --> 05:37:41.820 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I think the
 
05:37:43.730 --> 05:37:43.740 align:start position:0%
language on line six to eight indicate
 
05:37:45.770 --> 05:37:45.780 align:start position:0%
that a municipal host shall be located
 
05:37:47.390 --> 05:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
in the same municipality as all group
 
05:37:49.368 --> 05:37:49.378 align:start position:0%
members if the facility began operation
 
05:37:53.030 --> 05:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
after January 1 of 2021 so under the
 
05:37:54.650 --> 05:37:54.660 align:start position:0%
current statute
 
05:37:58.550 --> 05:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
all member unless your facility uh if
 
05:38:00.230 --> 05:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
you're still if your facility began
 
05:38:02.930 --> 05:38:02.940 align:start position:0%
operation after that date you can only
 
05:38:05.270 --> 05:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
serve group members within the context
 
05:38:07.730 --> 05:38:07.740 align:start position:0%
of your municipality so if I'm a
 
05:38:09.770 --> 05:38:09.780 align:start position:0%
municipal host and I'm in BO I can only
 
05:38:11.150 --> 05:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
serve group members if they're located
 
05:38:14.090 --> 05:38:14.100 align:start position:0%
within the municipality of Beau
 
05:38:16.850 --> 05:38:16.860 align:start position:0%
um you might have had more Legacy I
 
05:38:18.110 --> 05:38:18.120 align:start position:0%
guess you could say customer generators
 
05:38:20.390 --> 05:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
such as Hydro facilities who existed
 
05:38:22.190 --> 05:38:22.200 align:start position:0%
well before
 
05:38:24.770 --> 05:38:24.780 align:start position:0%
um January 1 of 2021 who under the
 
05:38:26.690 --> 05:38:26.700 align:start position:0%
current language have the ability to
 
05:38:28.490 --> 05:38:28.500 align:start position:0%
serve members outside of Municipal
 
05:38:31.430 --> 05:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
boundaries the department was not in
 
05:38:34.128 --> 05:38:34.138 align:start position:0%
creation around the time that this this
 
05:38:37.128 --> 05:38:37.138 align:start position:0%
bill came about but it is my
 
05:38:40.010 --> 05:38:40.020 align:start position:0%
understanding that the language on six
 
05:38:41.930 --> 05:38:41.940 align:start position:0%
online six to eight were meant to be
 
05:38:45.230 --> 05:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
somewhat of a limitation of pending the
 
05:38:48.770 --> 05:38:48.780 align:start position:0%
outcome of the vder study in the puc's
 
05:38:50.390 --> 05:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
adjudicated proceedings I hope that
 
05:38:54.070 --> 05:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:56.690 --> 05:38:56.700 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question
 
05:38:58.610 --> 05:38:58.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you again
 
05:39:00.830 --> 05:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
for uh trying to help us understand all
 
05:39:00.840 --> 05:39:02.090 align:start position:0%
for uh trying to help us understand all
this

05:39:02.090 --> 05:39:02.100 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:39:04.910 --> 05:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
um I I may have read this incorrectly
 
05:39:06.830 --> 05:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
which is entirely possible
 
05:39:09.170 --> 05:39:09.180 align:start position:0%
but I as I understood it what we were
 
05:39:14.330 --> 05:39:14.340 align:start position:0%
trying to do here was provide a a group
 
05:39:14.340 --> 05:39:15.708 align:start position:0%
trying to do here was provide a a group
say

05:39:15.708 --> 05:39:15.718 align:start position:0%
say
 
05:39:18.650 --> 05:39:18.660 align:start position:0%
um the city of Manchester
 
05:39:22.490 --> 05:39:22.500 align:start position:0%
um who wants to have a net metering
 
05:39:24.948 --> 05:39:24.958 align:start position:0%
facility but doesn't have the land in
 
05:39:28.670 --> 05:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
their town in their City yep to place
 
05:39:32.030 --> 05:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
that facility someplace outside of of
 
05:39:35.770 --> 05:39:35.780 align:start position:0%
their of their town make it you know
 
05:39:39.050 --> 05:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
excuse me you know rent rent the land
 
05:39:42.530 --> 05:39:42.540 align:start position:0%
enter into a contractual Arrangement and
 
05:39:44.868 --> 05:39:44.878 align:start position:0%
have the facility be there but it would
 
05:39:46.788 --> 05:39:46.798 align:start position:0%
still only provide support to the people
 
05:39:48.708 --> 05:39:48.718 align:start position:0%
that are part of that group sure it's
 
05:39:50.690 --> 05:39:50.700 align:start position:0%
not trying to expand the group it's just
 
05:39:51.890 --> 05:39:51.900 align:start position:0%
trying to give
 
05:39:51.900 --> 05:39:53.410 align:start position:0%
trying to give
give

05:39:53.410 --> 05:39:53.420 align:start position:0%
give
 
05:39:56.270 --> 05:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
municipal or give give groups the
 
05:39:58.610 --> 05:39:58.620 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
05:40:00.410 --> 05:40:00.420 align:start position:0%
give them more flexibility where they
 
05:40:02.810 --> 05:40:02.820 align:start position:0%
can locate the host sure so thank you
 
05:40:04.368 --> 05:40:04.378 align:start position:0%
for the question I'll unpack that a
 
05:40:05.628 --> 05:40:05.638 align:start position:0%
little bit so in regards to the
 
05:40:08.868 --> 05:40:08.878 align:start position:0%
Manchester example under the 10 that are
 
05:40:10.730 --> 05:40:10.740 align:start position:0%
registered in the state Manchester does
 
05:40:13.010 --> 05:40:13.020 align:start position:0%
have a municipal house registered in the
 
05:40:15.788 --> 05:40:15.798 align:start position:0%
state as well as Milton Berlin Gorham
 
05:40:19.730 --> 05:40:19.740 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough Canaan bosquin Hooksett
 
05:40:22.430 --> 05:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
Penacook and Durham
 
05:40:24.890 --> 05:40:24.900 align:start position:0%
um regard I think the easiest way to
 
05:40:27.530 --> 05:40:27.540 align:start position:0%
kind of view the statute is when the
 
05:40:29.628 --> 05:40:29.638 align:start position:0%
municipal house became active was it
 
05:40:32.750 --> 05:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
before January 1 of 2021 or after
 
05:40:36.288 --> 05:40:36.298 align:start position:0%
January of 20 or January of 2021. if you
 
05:40:39.288 --> 05:40:39.298 align:start position:0%
became in operation before then you have
 
05:40:40.670 --> 05:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
the ability to reach out to group
 
05:40:42.170 --> 05:40:42.180 align:start position:0%
members outside of your Municipal
 
05:40:44.390 --> 05:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
boundaries if you come into operation
 
05:40:48.708 --> 05:40:48.718 align:start position:0%
after 2021 after January of 2021
 
05:40:50.690 --> 05:40:50.700 align:start position:0%
it the language I would agree is is
 
05:40:53.590 --> 05:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
limiting in a way but it requires that
 
05:40:55.970 --> 05:40:55.980 align:start position:0%
if your Municipal host and you become an
 
05:40:58.910 --> 05:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
operation after a January of 2021 you
 
05:41:00.470 --> 05:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
can only serve members within the
 
05:41:02.810 --> 05:41:02.820 align:start position:0%
immediate boundaries of the municipal of
 
05:41:04.610 --> 05:41:04.620 align:start position:0%
the municipality that the host operates
 
05:41:09.470 --> 05:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
in so again citing say Manchester as an
 
05:41:12.770 --> 05:41:12.780 align:start position:0%
example and don't write this down or
 
05:41:14.330 --> 05:41:14.340 align:start position:0%
anything like that I have to do further
 
05:41:16.250 --> 05:41:16.260 align:start position:0%
specify on specificity on who their
 
05:41:18.890 --> 05:41:18.900 align:start position:0%
exact members are but hypothetically you
 
05:41:20.930 --> 05:41:20.940 align:start position:0%
if Manchester has say Hydro facility
 
05:41:23.990 --> 05:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
that existed prior to January of 2021
 
05:41:26.628 --> 05:41:26.638 align:start position:0%
they could have group members that are
 
05:41:28.250 --> 05:41:28.260 align:start position:0%
in municipalities outside of the
 
05:41:30.590 --> 05:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
immediate Manchester boundaries if it
 
05:41:32.208 --> 05:41:32.218 align:start position:0%
was a solar array that came into
 
05:41:34.550 --> 05:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
operation in Manchester after January of
 
05:41:37.070 --> 05:41:37.080 align:start position:0%
2021 it could only serve group members
 
05:41:39.590 --> 05:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
within Manchester itself I hope that
 
05:41:40.850 --> 05:41:40.860 align:start position:0%
makes sense
 
05:41:42.470 --> 05:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
that makes sense but I don't think that
 
05:41:44.150 --> 05:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
was what I was what I would where I was
 
05:41:45.590 --> 05:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
going with this and again I may be
 
05:41:48.190 --> 05:41:48.200 align:start position:0%
misinterpreting this but I I
 
05:41:51.530 --> 05:41:51.540 align:start position:0%
you keep you keep talking about being
 
05:41:53.868 --> 05:41:53.878 align:start position:0%
able to bring in more members yep you
 
05:41:56.208 --> 05:41:56.218 align:start position:0%
know surrounding cities and towns
 
05:41:58.128 --> 05:41:58.138 align:start position:0%
surrounding Manchester
 
05:42:00.890 --> 05:42:00.900 align:start position:0%
my understanding was that
 
05:42:04.250 --> 05:42:04.260 align:start position:0%
what we were trying to do was just allow
 
05:42:04.260 --> 05:42:06.288 align:start position:0%
what we were trying to do was just allow
a

05:42:06.288 --> 05:42:06.298 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:42:06.298 --> 05:42:06.948 align:start position:0%
a
um

05:42:06.948 --> 05:42:06.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:42:09.470 --> 05:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
a group that already exists with this
 
05:42:12.170 --> 05:42:12.180 align:start position:0%
with a with a defined number of members
 
05:42:14.890 --> 05:42:14.900 align:start position:0%
the ability to locate their facility
 
05:42:19.070 --> 05:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
outside of the confines of the the the
 
05:42:22.070 --> 05:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
the groups or the the groups that are
 
05:42:24.050 --> 05:42:24.060 align:start position:0%
part of the towns that are part of the
 
05:42:26.570 --> 05:42:26.580 align:start position:0%
group okay now I I'm sorry I think I did
 
05:42:27.770 --> 05:42:27.780 align:start position:0%
misunderstand your question so I
 
05:42:30.650 --> 05:42:30.660 align:start position:0%
apologize for that but um I I guess I
 
05:42:30.660 --> 05:42:31.788 align:start position:0%
apologize for that but um I I guess I
would

05:42:31.788 --> 05:42:31.798 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:42:33.590 --> 05:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
I would agree that that was maybe that's
 
05:42:35.810 --> 05:42:35.820 align:start position:0%
maybe the legislative intent here in
 
05:42:37.970 --> 05:42:37.980 align:start position:0%
this language is to allow maybe more
 
05:42:40.250 --> 05:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
easier citing for say solar arrays that
 
05:42:42.890 --> 05:42:42.900 align:start position:0%
are looking to come into operation now
 
05:42:44.208 --> 05:42:44.218 align:start position:0%
um I would agree that's probably the
 
05:42:46.250 --> 05:42:46.260 align:start position:0%
thrust of this language at least from
 
05:42:48.350 --> 05:42:48.360 align:start position:0%
the Department's perspective is that we
 
05:42:50.208 --> 05:42:50.218 align:start position:0%
would respectfully view that as a
 
05:42:52.070 --> 05:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
sizable change to the statute and we
 
05:42:54.830 --> 05:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
encourage policy makers to consider
 
05:42:56.868 --> 05:42:56.878 align:start position:0%
letting the adjudicative proceeding work
 
05:43:01.788 --> 05:43:01.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:04.010 --> 05:43:04.020 align:start position:0%
I ask one more follow-up
 
05:43:07.070 --> 05:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
uh it's okay if we have time after I ask
 
05:43:08.510 --> 05:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
my question
 
05:43:11.208 --> 05:43:11.218 align:start position:0%
so I have a question as well oh and I
 
05:43:13.368 --> 05:43:13.378 align:start position:0%
just received another pink card so we're
 
05:43:16.250 --> 05:43:16.260 align:start position:0%
going to have one more uh individual who
 
05:43:18.948 --> 05:43:18.958 align:start position:0%
wants to speak on this bill
 
05:43:21.890 --> 05:43:21.900 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
05:43:24.530 --> 05:43:24.540 align:start position:0%
isn't political subdivision a fairly
 
05:43:28.788 --> 05:43:28.798 align:start position:0%
well-defined term within uh legislative
 
05:43:31.430 --> 05:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
the legislative Realm
 
05:43:32.990 --> 05:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
I would agree with that sentiment as
 
05:43:34.788 --> 05:43:34.798 align:start position:0%
political subdivision within the context
 
05:43:38.330 --> 05:43:38.340 align:start position:0%
of this statute is defined online's 9 to
 
05:43:40.368 --> 05:43:40.378 align:start position:0%
12 in the bill
 
05:43:42.708 --> 05:43:42.718 align:start position:0%
so the dictionary defines political as
 
05:43:45.048 --> 05:43:45.058 align:start position:0%
relating to the government or the public
 
05:43:46.850 --> 05:43:46.860 align:start position:0%
affairs of a country
 
05:43:49.730 --> 05:43:49.740 align:start position:0%
relating to the ideas or strategies of a
 
05:43:52.610 --> 05:43:52.620 align:start position:0%
particular party or group in politics or
 
05:43:57.770 --> 05:43:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:00.350 --> 05:44:00.360 align:start position:0%
that would seem to preclude
 
05:44:02.530 --> 05:44:02.540 align:start position:0%
housing authorities quasi-public
 
05:44:06.048 --> 05:44:06.058 align:start position:0%
entities the peas Development Authority
 
05:44:07.970 --> 05:44:07.980 align:start position:0%
it's it's hard to imagine how those
 
05:44:09.730 --> 05:44:09.740 align:start position:0%
could be considered to be public
 
05:44:12.948 --> 05:44:12.958 align:start position:0%
subdivisions now I understand that you
 
05:44:15.048 --> 05:44:15.058 align:start position:0%
can Define it to be whatever you want it
 
05:44:15.890 --> 05:44:15.900 align:start position:0%
to be
 
05:44:15.900 --> 05:44:17.930 align:start position:0%
to be
but

05:44:17.930 --> 05:44:17.940 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:44:20.150 --> 05:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
there's what you can do and what you
 
05:44:24.830 --> 05:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
should do and redefining words and their
 
05:44:24.840 --> 05:44:25.730 align:start position:0%
should do and redefining words and their
meaning

05:44:25.730 --> 05:44:25.740 align:start position:0%
meaning
 
05:44:28.310 --> 05:44:28.320 align:start position:0%
can have under unintended consequences
 
05:44:30.530 --> 05:44:30.540 align:start position:0%
political subdivision is a term that's
 
05:44:32.570 --> 05:44:32.580 align:start position:0%
used in a lot of different places in
 
05:44:35.750 --> 05:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
legislation if we redefine it here could
 
05:44:39.410 --> 05:44:39.420 align:start position:0%
that have an unintended consequence to
 
05:44:42.470 --> 05:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
legislation elsewhere uh thank you for
 
05:44:47.390 --> 05:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
the question I I'm not entirely uh oh
 
05:44:49.190 --> 05:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
I understand what you're asking but I
 
05:44:50.810 --> 05:44:50.820 align:start position:0%
would just note that obviously for the
 
05:44:52.310 --> 05:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
purposes of just this statue the
 
05:44:53.510 --> 05:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
municipal house statute the term
 
05:44:55.430 --> 05:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
political subdivision is defined just
 
05:44:58.190 --> 05:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
for this statute whether or not the
 
05:44:59.930 --> 05:44:59.940 align:start position:0%
committee wishes to open up what
 
05:45:02.090 --> 05:45:02.100 align:start position:0%
political subdivision means to include
 
05:45:04.190 --> 05:45:04.200 align:start position:0%
other entities that might not
 
05:45:05.570 --> 05:45:05.580 align:start position:0%
necessarily be viewed through the lens
 
05:45:07.730 --> 05:45:07.740 align:start position:0%
of a political subdivision
 
05:45:10.010 --> 05:45:10.020 align:start position:0%
um and I you know such as private
 
05:45:11.930 --> 05:45:11.940 align:start position:0%
companies or quasi-public entities
 
05:45:14.150 --> 05:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
housing authorities you know
 
05:45:16.850 --> 05:45:16.860 align:start position:0%
big box stores what have you that's
 
05:45:18.288 --> 05:45:18.298 align:start position:0%
obviously a prerogative for the
 
05:45:21.110 --> 05:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
legislature to to make
 
05:45:24.590 --> 05:45:24.600 align:start position:0%
um but you know I over time you know if
 
05:45:26.030 --> 05:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
certain changes are made and we continue
 
05:45:28.548 --> 05:45:28.558 align:start position:0%
adding you know different entities
 
05:45:30.350 --> 05:45:30.360 align:start position:0%
within the definition of political
 
05:45:32.570 --> 05:45:32.580 align:start position:0%
subdivision I you know I would admit an
 
05:45:34.010 --> 05:45:34.020 align:start position:0%
argument could be made that it is
 
05:45:36.048 --> 05:45:36.058 align:start position:0%
warping the definition of what a
 
05:45:37.730 --> 05:45:37.740 align:start position:0%
political subdivision is
 
05:45:39.830 --> 05:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
05:45:41.930 --> 05:45:41.940 align:start position:0%
so you know further question oh you did
 
05:45:43.970 --> 05:45:43.980 align:start position:0%
have one more question no okay so you
 
05:45:45.590 --> 05:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
know further questions then we do have
 
05:45:47.330 --> 05:45:47.340 align:start position:0%
one additional person who would like to
 
05:45:50.448 --> 05:45:50.458 align:start position:0%
testify on this bill and that is
 
05:45:53.110 --> 05:45:53.120 align:start position:0%
Clark Fenner
 
05:45:58.128 --> 05:45:58.138 align:start position:0%
representing Synergy solar of Rye so
 
05:46:04.010 --> 05:46:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:06.288 --> 05:46:06.298 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for uh allowing me
 
05:46:07.850 --> 05:46:07.860 align:start position:0%
to speak I wanted to address
 
05:46:11.150 --> 05:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
specifically regarding this bill lines
 
05:46:13.910 --> 05:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
six through eight
 
05:46:16.190 --> 05:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
which are
 
05:46:18.770 --> 05:46:18.780 align:start position:0%
related to the removal of the statement
 
05:46:23.030 --> 05:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
of restricting the municipality to only
 
05:46:25.128 --> 05:46:25.138 align:start position:0%
serve members within the boundaries of
 
05:46:26.810 --> 05:46:26.820 align:start position:0%
that municipality
 
05:46:29.330 --> 05:46:29.340 align:start position:0%
there's two things that I wanted to
 
05:46:32.030 --> 05:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
comment regarding your statement that
 
05:46:34.510 --> 05:46:34.520 align:start position:0%
that was put in there specifically to
 
05:46:38.510 --> 05:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
restrict the explosive growth of solar
 
05:46:40.310 --> 05:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
within the state thus affecting the rate
 
05:46:43.788 --> 05:46:43.798 align:start position:0%
payers there's two things that come to
 
05:46:46.430 --> 05:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
mind here one is the fact that
 
05:46:50.868 --> 05:46:50.878 align:start position:0%
there are even with five megawatts as a
 
05:46:50.878 --> 05:46:52.970 align:start position:0%
there are even with five megawatts as a
limit

05:46:52.970 --> 05:46:52.980 align:start position:0%
limit
 
05:46:55.610 --> 05:46:55.620 align:start position:0%
the ability to interconnect a solar
 
05:47:00.948 --> 05:47:00.958 align:start position:0%
project into the grid is a complex
 
05:47:04.788 --> 05:47:04.798 align:start position:0%
entity it's like it's a complex effort
 
05:47:07.010 --> 05:47:07.020 align:start position:0%
the original grid was designed for
 
05:47:10.730 --> 05:47:10.740 align:start position:0%
centralized generation sent out to
 
05:47:13.310 --> 05:47:13.320 align:start position:0%
substations through transmission and
 
05:47:15.170 --> 05:47:15.180 align:start position:0%
then local distribution
 
05:47:17.330 --> 05:47:17.340 align:start position:0%
that concept and the way that the grid
 
05:47:18.590 --> 05:47:18.600 align:start position:0%
was designed
 
05:47:20.628 --> 05:47:20.638 align:start position:0%
particularly in New Hampshire is such
 
05:47:23.868 --> 05:47:23.878 align:start position:0%
that distributed generation
 
05:47:27.410 --> 05:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
is a difficult thing to accomplish on an
 
05:47:30.788 --> 05:47:30.798 align:start position:0%
economic basis for solar projects
 
05:47:34.070 --> 05:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
the ability to interconnect
 
05:47:37.368 --> 05:47:37.378 align:start position:0%
a one megawatt netbeater project now and
 
05:47:39.470 --> 05:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
we've done a number of them throughout
 
05:47:41.628 --> 05:47:41.638 align:start position:0%
the state over the past four or five
 
05:47:41.638 --> 05:47:42.850 align:start position:0%
the state over the past four or five
years

05:47:42.850 --> 05:47:42.860 align:start position:0%
years
 
05:47:45.350 --> 05:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
the cost of interconnection continues to
 
05:47:48.048 --> 05:47:48.058 align:start position:0%
go up particularly with inflation cost
 
05:47:50.390 --> 05:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
of diesel the cost of the
 
05:47:52.548 --> 05:47:52.558 align:start position:0%
interconnection equipment has
 
05:47:55.030 --> 05:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
skyrocketed and increased the cost to
 
05:47:58.490 --> 05:47:58.500 align:start position:0%
build these projects by between 40 to 70
 
05:47:59.750 --> 05:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
percent depending on what
 
05:48:02.590 --> 05:48:02.600 align:start position:0%
interconnection issues are required
 
05:48:05.270 --> 05:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
that being the way it is
 
05:48:09.350 --> 05:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
even with five megawatt uh projects
 
05:48:12.530 --> 05:48:12.540 align:start position:0%
you're you can't see explosive growth
 
05:48:15.890 --> 05:48:15.900 align:start position:0%
just due to interconnection cost issues
 
05:48:17.750 --> 05:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
um the the grid is just not designed for
 
05:48:20.570 --> 05:48:20.580 align:start position:0%
it we have to go through a process which
 
05:48:23.150 --> 05:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
we uncover these costs that end up being
 
05:48:26.448 --> 05:48:26.458 align:start position:0%
anywhere from you know 200 000 to a
 
05:48:28.490 --> 05:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
million dollars which kills projects and
 
05:48:31.368 --> 05:48:31.378 align:start position:0%
this happens on a regular basis
 
05:48:34.730 --> 05:48:34.740 align:start position:0%
relative to the language about keeping
 
05:48:34.740 --> 05:48:36.610 align:start position:0%
relative to the language about keeping
all

05:48:36.610 --> 05:48:36.620 align:start position:0%
all
 
05:48:40.670 --> 05:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
members of a municipal project within
 
05:48:44.270 --> 05:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
the boundaries of a given municipality
 
05:48:49.548 --> 05:48:49.558 align:start position:0%
when this was originally conceived of
 
05:48:51.590 --> 05:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
it goes back to when there was a general
 
05:48:54.590 --> 05:48:54.600 align:start position:0%
five megawatt increase that was
 
05:48:57.830 --> 05:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
contemplated it was passed on a
 
05:49:00.530 --> 05:49:00.540 align:start position:0%
bipartisan basis by the House
 
05:49:02.750 --> 05:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
Republicans senate senate Republicans
 
05:49:05.570 --> 05:49:05.580 align:start position:0%
and Democrats and vetoed by the governor
 
05:49:05.580 --> 05:49:07.788 align:start position:0%
and Democrats and vetoed by the governor
twice

05:49:07.788 --> 05:49:07.798 align:start position:0%
twice
 
05:49:09.890 --> 05:49:09.900 align:start position:0%
um ultimately
 
05:49:13.128 --> 05:49:13.138 align:start position:0%
the governor agreed based on pressure
 
05:49:16.970 --> 05:49:16.980 align:start position:0%
from 12 Mayors throughout the state
 
05:49:20.948 --> 05:49:20.958 align:start position:0%
he agreed that okay you guys want this
 
05:49:24.110 --> 05:49:24.120 align:start position:0%
will allow for the expansion of five
 
05:49:26.208 --> 05:49:26.218 align:start position:0%
megawatts from municipalities hence the
 
05:49:28.730 --> 05:49:28.740 align:start position:0%
creation of this
 
05:49:31.970 --> 05:49:31.980 align:start position:0%
in reality what's happened
 
05:49:34.850 --> 05:49:34.860 align:start position:0%
is that this bill supports about five
 
05:49:36.890 --> 05:49:36.900 align:start position:0%
municipalities here in the state
 
05:49:39.890 --> 05:49:39.900 align:start position:0%
with that statement in there
 
05:49:42.770 --> 05:49:42.780 align:start position:0%
the load that was talked about
 
05:49:45.350 --> 05:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
there are only the largest cities within
 
05:49:47.810 --> 05:49:47.820 align:start position:0%
the state have got the load
 
05:49:50.990 --> 05:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
that can satisfy five a five megawatt
 
05:49:53.208 --> 05:49:53.218 align:start position:0%
project or even smaller within their
 
05:49:53.218 --> 05:49:54.650 align:start position:0%
project or even smaller within their
boundaries

05:49:54.650 --> 05:49:54.660 align:start position:0%
boundaries
 
05:49:57.230 --> 05:49:57.240 align:start position:0%
and those cities are
 
05:50:00.230 --> 05:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
Manchester Concord Nashua possibly
 
05:50:00.240 --> 05:50:01.330 align:start position:0%
Manchester Concord Nashua possibly
Portsmouth

05:50:01.330 --> 05:50:01.340 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth
 
05:50:04.128 --> 05:50:04.138 align:start position:0%
maybe Franklin
 
05:50:06.530 --> 05:50:06.540 align:start position:0%
all the rest of them are excluded from
 
05:50:07.548 --> 05:50:07.558 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:50:09.230 --> 05:50:09.240 align:start position:0%
and I don't believe that's what the
 
05:50:10.788 --> 05:50:10.798 align:start position:0%
governor or all the other Mayors had
 
05:50:10.798 --> 05:50:11.810 align:start position:0%
governor or all the other Mayors had
intended

05:50:11.810 --> 05:50:11.820 align:start position:0%
intended
 
05:50:14.330 --> 05:50:14.340 align:start position:0%
it should be an equitable application
 
05:50:16.730 --> 05:50:16.740 align:start position:0%
across the state by removing that
 
05:50:19.490 --> 05:50:19.500 align:start position:0%
statement the lines of six through eight
 
05:50:21.530 --> 05:50:21.540 align:start position:0%
now you can apply it across the state
 
05:50:24.410 --> 05:50:24.420 align:start position:0%
because as was pointed out before you've
 
05:50:26.330 --> 05:50:26.340 align:start position:0%
got certain States
 
05:50:28.250 --> 05:50:28.260 align:start position:0%
that are up in the mountains they don't
 
05:50:33.110 --> 05:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
have the landscape that is solar capable
 
05:50:35.150 --> 05:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
too much shading too many Wetlands
 
05:50:35.160 --> 05:50:37.128 align:start position:0%
too much shading too many Wetlands
mountainous

05:50:37.128 --> 05:50:37.138 align:start position:0%
mountainous
 
05:50:40.490 --> 05:50:40.500 align:start position:0%
Etc you could never cite any uh solo
 
05:50:41.810 --> 05:50:41.820 align:start position:0%
there if you wanted to
 
05:50:44.890 --> 05:50:44.900 align:start position:0%
however next to them may be a
 
05:50:47.628 --> 05:50:47.638 align:start position:0%
municipality a smaller one uh maybe
 
05:50:49.850 --> 05:50:49.860 align:start position:0%
several of them which have got some land
 
05:50:52.128 --> 05:50:52.138 align:start position:0%
would love to produce it they have no
 
05:50:54.048 --> 05:50:54.058 align:start position:0%
load so I've got to spread that load
 
05:50:54.058 --> 05:50:55.070 align:start position:0%
load so I've got to spread that load
around

05:50:55.070 --> 05:50:55.080 align:start position:0%
around
 
05:50:57.830 --> 05:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
a good example we're doing a project on
 
05:51:00.470 --> 05:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
a landfill in Laconia getting ready to
 
05:51:03.048 --> 05:51:03.058 align:start position:0%
go it's only three megawatts Laconia is
 
05:51:05.330 --> 05:51:05.340 align:start position:0%
not a small City and we are struggling
 
05:51:07.570 --> 05:51:07.580 align:start position:0%
to sign up enough
 
05:51:10.368 --> 05:51:10.378 align:start position:0%
off take from within that municipality
 
05:51:12.530 --> 05:51:12.540 align:start position:0%
to satisfy that project and the city
 
05:51:13.970 --> 05:51:13.980 align:start position:0%
really wants it
 
05:51:17.390 --> 05:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
and it's a republican City so when you
 
05:51:19.670 --> 05:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
look at the application of this across
 
05:51:20.628 --> 05:51:20.638 align:start position:0%
the state
 
05:51:22.548 --> 05:51:22.558 align:start position:0%
and the fairness to the smaller
 
05:51:24.948 --> 05:51:24.958 align:start position:0%
communities as well as the that have got
 
05:51:27.230 --> 05:51:27.240 align:start position:0%
the land but no load and as was pointed
 
05:51:28.788 --> 05:51:28.798 align:start position:0%
out you've got other municipalities have
 
05:51:31.070 --> 05:51:31.080 align:start position:0%
got the load but no land
 
05:51:35.510 --> 05:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
this allows for an equitable application
 
05:51:37.490 --> 05:51:37.500 align:start position:0%
and again you've got the limiting issue
 
05:51:40.070 --> 05:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
as far as explosive growth relative just
 
05:51:42.470 --> 05:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
the interconnection issue itself
 
05:51:44.330 --> 05:51:44.340 align:start position:0%
to give you an example
 
05:51:45.948 --> 05:51:45.958 align:start position:0%
in the state of Maine
 
05:51:49.368 --> 05:51:49.378 align:start position:0%
that fought net metering for years under
 
05:51:52.730 --> 05:51:52.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:55.490 --> 05:51:55.500 align:start position:0%
once Governor Mills was elected
 
05:51:58.070 --> 05:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
there was a land rush up there everybody
 
05:52:00.530 --> 05:52:00.540 align:start position:0%
looked at it farmland
 
05:52:02.810 --> 05:52:02.820 align:start position:0%
lots of what appeared to be distribution
 
05:52:02.820 --> 05:52:03.910 align:start position:0%
lots of what appeared to be distribution
lines

05:52:03.910 --> 05:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
lines
 
05:52:06.530 --> 05:52:06.540 align:start position:0%
they received over two gigawatts of
 
05:52:06.540 --> 05:52:08.510 align:start position:0%
they received over two gigawatts of
applications

05:52:08.510 --> 05:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
applications
 
05:52:08.520 --> 05:52:10.010 align:start position:0%
applications
and

05:52:10.010 --> 05:52:10.020 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:52:12.530 --> 05:52:12.540 align:start position:0%
you're going to be lucky to see
 
05:52:15.530 --> 05:52:15.540 align:start position:0%
maybe 800 megawatts get
 
05:52:18.170 --> 05:52:18.180 align:start position:0%
uh interconnected up there
 
05:52:21.410 --> 05:52:21.420 align:start position:0%
strictly an interconnection issue
 
05:52:23.448 --> 05:52:23.458 align:start position:0%
projects applied particularly five
 
05:52:25.490 --> 05:52:25.500 align:start position:0%
megawatt projects applied
 
05:52:27.650 --> 05:52:27.660 align:start position:0%
they were doing cluster studies to
 
05:52:29.448 --> 05:52:29.458 align:start position:0%
determine can the transmission system
 
05:52:31.610 --> 05:52:31.620 align:start position:0%
handle it transmission system can't
 
05:52:32.868 --> 05:52:32.878 align:start position:0%
handle it
 
05:52:34.430 --> 05:52:34.440 align:start position:0%
these guys want to build these projects
 
05:52:35.448 --> 05:52:35.458 align:start position:0%
they're have they're looking at
 
05:52:38.030 --> 05:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
individual interconnection charges just
 
05:52:39.590 --> 05:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
for transmission upgrades of between
 
05:52:41.810 --> 05:52:41.820 align:start position:0%
five and six million dollars and these
 
05:52:43.490 --> 05:52:43.500 align:start position:0%
upgrades taking between five and seven
 
05:52:47.690 --> 05:52:47.700 align:start position:0%
years those projects are dead so I think
 
05:52:49.910 --> 05:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of the fear-mongering about the
 
05:52:52.010 --> 05:52:52.020 align:start position:0%
state being covered in solar panels and
 
05:52:55.010 --> 05:52:55.020 align:start position:0%
and destroying the the landscape in the
 
05:52:58.250 --> 05:52:58.260 align:start position:0%
state is is unfounded
 
05:53:00.410 --> 05:53:00.420 align:start position:0%
it's not based in reality
 
05:53:04.310 --> 05:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
and as much as and the effect is that
 
05:53:05.990 --> 05:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
we've got utilities that aren't are
 
05:53:07.730 --> 05:53:07.740 align:start position:0%
terribly friendly to the effort either
 
05:53:07.740 --> 05:53:10.190 align:start position:0%
terribly friendly to the effort either
but

05:53:10.190 --> 05:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:53:12.288 --> 05:53:12.298 align:start position:0%
the functioning of actually getting
 
05:53:14.030 --> 05:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
these accomplished
 
05:53:18.708 --> 05:53:18.718 align:start position:0%
it's expensive it's time consuming and
 
05:53:21.110 --> 05:53:21.120 align:start position:0%
um I think that between as I mentioned
 
05:53:23.510 --> 05:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
the cost of interconnection and the
 
05:53:25.788 --> 05:53:25.798 align:start position:0%
application of this particular bill on
 
05:53:27.470 --> 05:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
an equitable basis across all
 
05:53:30.048 --> 05:53:30.058 align:start position:0%
municipalities not just five
 
05:53:32.030 --> 05:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
it's something that should be considered
 
05:53:34.670 --> 05:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
and that's why I do support this because
 
05:53:37.190 --> 05:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
I believe that it's fair
 
05:53:37.200 --> 05:53:38.270 align:start position:0%
I believe that it's fair
okay

05:53:38.270 --> 05:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:53:40.548 --> 05:53:40.558 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much can I ask you a
 
05:53:42.530 --> 05:53:42.540 align:start position:0%
couple of questions to help me
 
05:53:45.470 --> 05:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
understand this issue thoroughly
 
05:53:48.288 --> 05:53:48.298 align:start position:0%
if a given municipality can't support
 
05:53:50.930 --> 05:53:50.940 align:start position:0%
five megawatts of load
 
05:53:52.670 --> 05:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
why can't they just build a smaller
 
05:53:52.680 --> 05:53:54.110 align:start position:0%
why can't they just build a smaller
system

05:53:54.110 --> 05:53:54.120 align:start position:0%
system
 
05:53:57.890 --> 05:53:57.900 align:start position:0%
or one megawatt or 1.5 or whatever
 
05:54:01.610 --> 05:54:01.620 align:start position:0%
thanks for the questions very good one
 
05:54:04.730 --> 05:54:04.740 align:start position:0%
um a one megawatt system costs the same
 
05:54:06.350 --> 05:54:06.360 align:start position:0%
to interconnect as a five megawatt
 
05:54:06.360 --> 05:54:07.190 align:start position:0%
to interconnect as a five megawatt
system

05:54:07.190 --> 05:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
system
 
05:54:08.990 --> 05:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
and the cost of that interconnection as
 
05:54:10.490 --> 05:54:10.500 align:start position:0%
I mentioned is just continuing to
 
05:54:12.410 --> 05:54:12.420 align:start position:0%
Skyrocket to the point where one
 
05:54:14.448 --> 05:54:14.458 align:start position:0%
megawatt projects are becoming
 
05:54:19.250 --> 05:54:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:20.750 --> 05:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
I know we're not supposed to debate
 
05:54:24.590 --> 05:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
people when when they speak to us but my
 
05:54:26.868 --> 05:54:26.878 align:start position:0%
follow-up question would be how can it
 
05:54:29.090 --> 05:54:29.100 align:start position:0%
be possible for a five megawatt system
 
05:54:33.048 --> 05:54:33.058 align:start position:0%
which requires 25 acres of land to cost
 
05:54:35.750 --> 05:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
the same as a one megawatt system which
 
05:54:38.990 --> 05:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
only requires five acres of land
 
05:54:42.170 --> 05:54:42.180 align:start position:0%
is a 20 acre difference there and as we
 
05:54:44.270 --> 05:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
all know land is expensive
 
05:54:46.190 --> 05:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
how could how could you make the the
 
05:54:49.310 --> 05:54:49.320 align:start position:0%
claim that they both cost the same it's
 
05:54:51.230 --> 05:54:51.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and it's not
 
05:54:54.048 --> 05:54:54.058 align:start position:0%
the um it's not the
 
05:54:56.570 --> 05:54:56.580 align:start position:0%
functioning of the project itself
 
05:54:59.570 --> 05:54:59.580 align:start position:0%
uh the land cost Etc because the land
 
05:55:01.970 --> 05:55:01.980 align:start position:0%
itself these these generally get paid a
 
05:55:05.330 --> 05:55:05.340 align:start position:0%
lease rate uh that's based on output of
 
05:55:07.368 --> 05:55:07.378 align:start position:0%
the project how much how much revenue it
 
05:55:07.378 --> 05:55:08.930 align:start position:0%
the project how much how much revenue it
generates

05:55:08.930 --> 05:55:08.940 align:start position:0%
generates
 
05:55:11.030 --> 05:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
the larger one of the largest expenses
 
05:55:13.910 --> 05:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
that we incur when we're building these
 
05:55:17.208 --> 05:55:17.218 align:start position:0%
is not the it's it's the actual
 
05:55:21.288 --> 05:55:21.298 align:start position:0%
interconnection equipment line upgrades
 
05:55:24.170 --> 05:55:24.180 align:start position:0%
Etc uh in some in some cases substation
 
05:55:27.350 --> 05:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
upgrades necessary to interconnect any
 
05:55:31.430 --> 05:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
power to a substation which was never
 
05:55:34.128 --> 05:55:34.138 align:start position:0%
designed to take any power into it the
 
05:55:35.570 --> 05:55:35.580 align:start position:0%
initial grid was designed for the power
 
05:55:38.390 --> 05:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
to flow out in One Direction now that
 
05:55:39.770 --> 05:55:39.780 align:start position:0%
that power's got to flow in two
 
05:55:43.430 --> 05:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
directions and so the fuses the one of
 
05:55:46.128 --> 05:55:46.138 align:start position:0%
those reclosers the air brake switches
 
05:55:48.830 --> 05:55:48.840 align:start position:0%
Etc all of that between the site of this
 
05:55:51.830 --> 05:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
the project and the sub substation at
 
05:55:54.350 --> 05:55:54.360 align:start position:0%
least have got to be replaced and
 
05:55:56.090 --> 05:55:56.100 align:start position:0%
depending on how far from the substation
 
05:55:58.788 --> 05:55:58.798 align:start position:0%
it is the uh the cost of that can run
 
05:56:01.850 --> 05:56:01.860 align:start position:0%
into the millions of dollars and
 
05:56:03.948 --> 05:56:03.958 align:start position:0%
um when you're looking at the amount of
 
05:56:05.628 --> 05:56:05.638 align:start position:0%
power that and revenue that's generated
 
05:56:07.670 --> 05:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
by a one megawatt project versus that
 
05:56:09.230 --> 05:56:09.240 align:start position:0%
which is generated by a five megawatt
 
05:56:11.750 --> 05:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
projects you've got five times the
 
05:56:11.760 --> 05:56:12.650 align:start position:0%
projects you've got five times the
revenue

05:56:12.650 --> 05:56:12.660 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
05:56:15.830 --> 05:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
to amortize that cost over versus just
 
05:56:18.410 --> 05:56:18.420 align:start position:0%
one time so depending on the cost of
 
05:56:18.420 --> 05:56:19.490 align:start position:0%
one time so depending on the cost of
that

05:56:19.490 --> 05:56:19.500 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:56:22.310 --> 05:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
you can completely be eliminated from
 
05:56:24.470 --> 05:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
doing a project at one megawatt whereas
 
05:56:25.910 --> 05:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
if you're generating five times the
 
05:56:29.990 --> 05:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
revenue and we've got from a solar uh
 
05:56:31.970 --> 05:56:31.980 align:start position:0%
net metering standpoint we've got low
 
05:56:34.190 --> 05:56:34.200 align:start position:0%
Revenue coming into into these projects
 
05:56:36.350 --> 05:56:36.360 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire compared to say
 
05:56:37.910 --> 05:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that's a whole different
 
05:56:40.970 --> 05:56:40.980 align:start position:0%
animal but um
 
05:56:43.670 --> 05:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
um it's it's purely that issue it's it's
 
05:56:46.548 --> 05:56:46.558 align:start position:0%
a revenue uh recognition issue five
 
05:56:48.948 --> 05:56:48.958 align:start position:0%
megawatts versus one whereas your cost
 
05:56:52.910 --> 05:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:54.530 --> 05:56:54.540 align:start position:0%
it's a good explanation thank you
 
05:56:58.010 --> 05:56:58.020 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi has a question
 
05:57:00.830 --> 05:57:00.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so I I'm
 
05:57:03.470 --> 05:57:03.480 align:start position:0%
following this interconnection issue
 
05:57:05.628 --> 05:57:05.638 align:start position:0%
that you're saying that's the Big Driver
 
05:57:09.110 --> 05:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
of cost here yes it is uh so
 
05:57:12.890 --> 05:57:12.900 align:start position:0%
the example you gave of of
 
05:57:16.150 --> 05:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
four or five communities that you know
 
05:57:20.750 --> 05:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
may have population density but not the
 
05:57:24.048 --> 05:57:24.058 align:start position:0%
land and vice versa I
 
05:57:26.390 --> 05:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
tease that out a little bit for me on on
 
05:57:28.070 --> 05:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
the interconnection now because it seems
 
05:57:30.948 --> 05:57:30.958 align:start position:0%
the same interconnection issue applies
 
05:57:34.190 --> 05:57:34.200 align:start position:0%
so how's that work thank you for the
 
05:57:36.230 --> 05:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
question actually I may have convoluted
 
05:57:40.190 --> 05:57:40.200 align:start position:0%
uh uh two different issues there the um
 
05:57:42.190 --> 05:57:42.200 align:start position:0%
the issue regarding
 
05:57:46.368 --> 05:57:46.378 align:start position:0%
sharing effectively uh Municipal load
 
05:57:50.150 --> 05:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
amongst multiple communities uh for a
 
05:57:53.510 --> 05:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
single project for instance the one I
 
05:57:55.910 --> 05:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
stated which was Laconia and if we had
 
05:57:58.610 --> 05:57:58.620 align:start position:0%
the ability to go out to uh Meredith and
 
05:58:00.350 --> 05:58:00.360 align:start position:0%
gillington and other you know
 
05:58:02.990 --> 05:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
surrounding towns that would like to say
 
05:58:04.730 --> 05:58:04.740 align:start position:0%
that we're getting our power effectively
 
05:58:07.730 --> 05:58:07.740 align:start position:0%
from the Laconia landfill project they
 
05:58:09.890 --> 05:58:09.900 align:start position:0%
would be able to do that and they would
 
05:58:13.690 --> 05:58:13.700 align:start position:0%
have a desire to do that the issue about
 
05:58:17.030 --> 05:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
interconnection cost is strictly a one
 
05:58:19.490 --> 05:58:19.500 align:start position:0%
to five megawatt issue it doesn't have
 
05:58:22.270 --> 05:58:22.280 align:start position:0%
anything to do with the the uh
 
05:58:26.448 --> 05:58:26.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:29.030 --> 05:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
spreading of the of the load amongst
 
05:58:32.030 --> 05:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
multiple communities okay got it thank
 
05:58:34.430 --> 05:58:34.440 align:start position:0%
you sure thank you sir
 
05:58:36.288 --> 05:58:36.298 align:start position:0%
and someone who serves on a planning
 
05:58:39.470 --> 05:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
board and Deals constantly with land use
 
05:58:42.470 --> 05:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
issues and disputes
 
05:58:45.590 --> 05:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
if one of these projects was to span
 
05:58:48.650 --> 05:58:48.660 align:start position:0%
Municipal boundaries
 
05:58:51.170 --> 05:58:51.180 align:start position:0%
would that open the door to political
 
05:58:53.990 --> 05:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
disputes between the governing bodies of
 
05:58:56.330 --> 05:58:56.340 align:start position:0%
the respective Towns over
 
05:58:59.030 --> 05:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
ownership of the project the provision
 
05:59:01.910 --> 05:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
of benefits of the project uh
 
05:59:04.850 --> 05:59:04.860 align:start position:0%
land use jurisdiction over the project
 
05:59:04.860 --> 05:59:06.430 align:start position:0%
land use jurisdiction over the project
Etc

05:59:06.430 --> 05:59:06.440 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
05:59:09.110 --> 05:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh Mr
 
05:59:12.110 --> 05:59:12.120 align:start position:0%
chairman I think that I
 
05:59:14.690 --> 05:59:14.700 align:start position:0%
I haven't seen that issue
 
05:59:17.090 --> 05:59:17.100 align:start position:0%
um coming up of having a single project
 
05:59:19.850 --> 05:59:19.860 align:start position:0%
stand multiple municipality Municipal
 
05:59:21.830 --> 05:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
boundaries we try to avoid that
 
05:59:26.810 --> 05:59:26.820 align:start position:0%
completely in fact even when we have a
 
05:59:30.110 --> 05:59:30.120 align:start position:0%
a single project where the land may be
 
05:59:33.350 --> 05:59:33.360 align:start position:0%
owned by uh or maybe subdivided into
 
05:59:34.970 --> 05:59:34.980 align:start position:0%
multiple parcels
 
05:59:34.980 --> 05:59:37.128 align:start position:0%
multiple parcels
and

05:59:37.128 --> 05:59:37.138 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:59:40.548 --> 05:59:40.558 align:start position:0%
usually owned by the same entity what
 
05:59:42.350 --> 05:59:42.360 align:start position:0%
we'll generally do is go through a lot
 
05:59:44.030 --> 05:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
line adjustment so that the project
 
05:59:46.490 --> 05:59:46.500 align:start position:0%
remains on a single parcel of land and
 
05:59:48.650 --> 05:59:48.660 align:start position:0%
in this case within a single
 
05:59:52.788 --> 05:59:52.798 align:start position:0%
municipality so I don't see that I
 
05:59:55.310 --> 05:59:55.320 align:start position:0%
understand the issue relative to peace
 
05:59:56.990 --> 05:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
Development Authority where you may be
 
05:59:57.000 --> 05:59:58.690 align:start position:0%
Development Authority where you may be
spanning

05:59:58.690 --> 05:59:58.700 align:start position:0%
spanning
 
06:00:02.810 --> 06:00:02.820 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth and Newington and that's a
 
06:00:05.570 --> 06:00:05.580 align:start position:0%
good question and I'm not probably the
 
06:00:07.910 --> 06:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
person to answer that
 
06:00:10.250 --> 06:00:10.260 align:start position:0%
saw a hand up over to representative
 
06:00:11.990 --> 06:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
Kaplan has a question
 
06:00:13.250 --> 06:00:13.260 align:start position:0%
all right thank you Mr chair and thank
 
06:00:15.948 --> 06:00:15.958 align:start position:0%
you for for being here and presenting
 
06:00:17.570 --> 06:00:17.580 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that there are
 
06:00:19.430 --> 06:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
currently five cities or five
 
06:00:20.930 --> 06:00:20.940 align:start position:0%
municipalities that are capable of
 
06:00:22.368 --> 06:00:22.378 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of the laws that now
 
06:00:25.070 --> 06:00:25.080 align:start position:0%
stands uh so that would be a total 25
 
06:00:27.070 --> 06:00:27.080 align:start position:0%
megawatts of solar
 
06:00:30.470 --> 06:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
if if roughly if there was only
 
06:00:30.480 --> 06:00:31.910 align:start position:0%
if if roughly if there was only
um

06:00:31.910 --> 06:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:00:35.270 --> 06:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
in terms of of the amount of load we'd
 
06:00:38.390 --> 06:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
have to when we get involved in uh
 
06:00:43.390 --> 06:00:43.400 align:start position:0%
analyzing a given project and what the
 
06:00:46.310 --> 06:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
municipality can actually handle before
 
06:00:48.830 --> 06:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
we design the system we went through
 
06:00:51.830 --> 06:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
this with as I said with Laconia where
 
06:00:54.170 --> 06:00:54.180 align:start position:0%
we had to be very cognizant about how
 
06:00:56.990 --> 06:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
much load can they actually take
 
06:00:59.948 --> 06:00:59.958 align:start position:0%
or or present and
 
06:01:02.510 --> 06:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
subscribe to the project so that we
 
06:01:04.310 --> 06:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
don't over build it
 
06:01:04.320 --> 06:01:05.690 align:start position:0%
don't over build it
um

06:01:05.690 --> 06:01:05.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:01:08.330 --> 06:01:08.340 align:start position:0%
and so we have to go through their last
 
06:01:10.368 --> 06:01:10.378 align:start position:0%
three years of power usage and take into
 
06:01:11.868 --> 06:01:11.878 align:start position:0%
account in this particular case the
 
06:01:13.910 --> 06:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
coveted years which was power usage was
 
06:01:15.890 --> 06:01:15.900 align:start position:0%
down and we had to balance it out such
 
06:01:18.410 --> 06:01:18.420 align:start position:0%
that we knew that over the next we could
 
06:01:20.208 --> 06:01:20.218 align:start position:0%
estimate over the next 10 to 20 years
 
06:01:23.750 --> 06:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
that we would still be able to maintain
 
06:01:27.650 --> 06:01:27.660 align:start position:0%
um that Municipal load specific for that
 
06:01:31.490 --> 06:01:31.500 align:start position:0%
project and you know you've got cities
 
06:01:34.670 --> 06:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
that are going through Energy Efficiency
 
06:01:36.410 --> 06:01:36.420 align:start position:0%
programs trying to reduce their power
 
06:01:38.930 --> 06:01:38.940 align:start position:0%
load they may be using so much today but
 
06:01:40.070 --> 06:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
maybe a little bit later they're going
 
06:01:42.048 --> 06:01:42.058 align:start position:0%
to be using less but they're going to be
 
06:01:43.910 --> 06:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
expanding the school system so possibly
 
06:01:45.948 --> 06:01:45.958 align:start position:0%
it's going to go up it's there's a lot
 
06:01:48.410 --> 06:01:48.420 align:start position:0%
of moving parts so my question is if if
 
06:01:51.350 --> 06:01:51.360 align:start position:0%
this if you need a follow-up yeah I
 
06:01:53.990 --> 06:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
guess his fault uh if if we did pass
 
06:01:56.570 --> 06:01:56.580 align:start position:0%
this this bill do you have an estimation
 
06:01:58.368 --> 06:01:58.378 align:start position:0%
of how many more projects would be
 
06:02:01.368 --> 06:02:01.378 align:start position:0%
viable in New Hampshire uh thank you for
 
06:02:04.490 --> 06:02:04.500 align:start position:0%
the question I I don't have that number
 
06:02:10.430 --> 06:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:12.590 --> 06:02:12.600 align:start position:0%
okay in addition to the fact that it was
 
06:02:14.628 --> 06:02:14.638 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier that
 
06:02:16.730 --> 06:02:16.740 align:start position:0%
um there is a net metering docket that's
 
06:02:19.490 --> 06:02:19.500 align:start position:0%
in process and we've been advised to
 
06:02:22.310 --> 06:02:22.320 align:start position:0%
wait until that's finished uh it should
 
06:02:24.350 --> 06:02:24.360 align:start position:0%
be also noted that there is also an
 
06:02:27.590 --> 06:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
interconnection study docket that's in
 
06:02:29.690 --> 06:02:29.700 align:start position:0%
process we should probably wait until
 
06:02:32.628 --> 06:02:32.638 align:start position:0%
that's completed as well
 
06:02:34.250 --> 06:02:34.260 align:start position:0%
all right seeing no further questions I
 
06:02:35.510 --> 06:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
want to thank you Mr Fenner for being
 
06:02:38.330 --> 06:02:38.340 align:start position:0%
here I appreciated your your insights
 
06:02:41.330 --> 06:02:41.340 align:start position:0%
and your information thank you very much
 
06:02:44.448 --> 06:02:44.458 align:start position:0%
and having no more pink cards on this uh
 
06:02:46.730 --> 06:02:46.740 align:start position:0%
on this bill I'm going to close the
 
06:02:48.830 --> 06:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill
 
06:02:48.840 --> 06:02:51.410 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill
139

06:02:51.410 --> 06:02:51.420 align:start position:0%
139
 
06:02:51.420 --> 06:02:52.850 align:start position:0%
139
and

06:02:52.850 --> 06:02:52.860 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:02:56.470 --> 06:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
I will then yield the gavel to
 
06:02:59.330 --> 06:02:59.340 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas since I am the
 
06:03:02.750 --> 06:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of the next bill so
 
06:03:05.208 --> 06:03:05.218 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas take over and open
 
06:03:13.610 --> 06:03:13.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:24.788 --> 06:03:24.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:26.990 --> 06:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
representative do you have the blue
 
06:03:31.010 --> 06:03:31.020 align:start position:0%
sheet for the previous bill
 
06:03:34.548 --> 06:03:34.558 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you all
 
06:03:37.368 --> 06:03:37.378 align:start position:0%
I'll spill 139
 
06:03:39.230 --> 06:03:39.240 align:start position:0%
the blue sheet there was
 
06:03:42.170 --> 06:03:42.180 align:start position:0%
two in favor none opposed
 
06:03:45.010 --> 06:03:45.020 align:start position:0%
online there was
 
06:03:49.030 --> 06:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
106 in favor three opposed
 
06:03:53.030 --> 06:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:56.750 --> 06:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:01.448 --> 06:04:01.458 align:start position:0%
okay we'll open up public hearing on HB
 
06:04:06.770 --> 06:04:06.780 align:start position:0%
219 I believe yes 219 and our Prime
 
06:04:09.650 --> 06:04:09.660 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative votes
 
06:04:12.170 --> 06:04:12.180 align:start position:0%
ready to speak
 
06:04:14.868 --> 06:04:14.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
06:04:16.190 --> 06:04:16.200 align:start position:0%
for the record
 
06:04:18.708 --> 06:04:18.718 align:start position:0%
representative Michael Vose representing
 
06:04:22.548 --> 06:04:22.558 align:start position:0%
Rockingham District 5 the town of Epping
 
06:04:25.010 --> 06:04:25.020 align:start position:0%
serve as chair of this committee
 
06:04:27.170 --> 06:04:27.180 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to introduce House Bill
 
06:04:28.970 --> 06:04:28.980 align:start position:0%
219 FN
 
06:04:30.910 --> 06:04:30.920 align:start position:0%
which is a bill that
 
06:04:34.430 --> 06:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
repeals or moves several RSA chapters no
 
06:04:36.350 --> 06:04:36.360 align:start position:0%
longer associated with the with
 
06:04:38.030 --> 06:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
Administration by the department of
 
06:04:39.770 --> 06:04:39.780 align:start position:0%
energy of the Public Utilities
 
06:04:41.330 --> 06:04:41.340 align:start position:0%
Commission or the Public Utilities
 
06:04:42.770 --> 06:04:42.780 align:start position:0%
Commission and establishes the
 
06:04:45.350 --> 06:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
legislative committee to examine to
 
06:04:48.288 --> 06:04:48.298 align:start position:0%
examine other statutory provisions
 
06:04:51.948 --> 06:04:51.958 align:start position:0%
I filed this bill on behalf of the
 
06:04:54.650 --> 06:04:54.660 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission
 
06:04:58.310 --> 06:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
they sent me a relatively extensive list
 
06:04:58.320 --> 06:05:01.868 align:start position:0%
they sent me a relatively extensive list
of

06:05:01.868 --> 06:05:01.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:06.410 --> 06:05:06.420 align:start position:0%
rsas which they feel are no longer under
 
06:05:08.810 --> 06:05:08.820 align:start position:0%
their purview
 
06:05:10.850 --> 06:05:10.860 align:start position:0%
a fun fact about the Public Utilities
 
06:05:14.090 --> 06:05:14.100 align:start position:0%
Commission back in the 1880s and the
 
06:05:14.100 --> 06:05:15.650 align:start position:0%
Commission back in the 1880s and the
1890s

06:05:15.650 --> 06:05:15.660 align:start position:0%
1890s
 
06:05:17.208 --> 06:05:17.218 align:start position:0%
the puc
 
06:05:20.390 --> 06:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
regulated railroads in the state of New
 
06:05:20.400 --> 06:05:21.708 align:start position:0%
regulated railroads in the state of New
Hampshire

06:05:21.708 --> 06:05:21.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
06:05:24.650 --> 06:05:24.660 align:start position:0%
there were no electric utilities back
 
06:05:24.660 --> 06:05:25.430 align:start position:0%
there were no electric utilities back
then

06:05:25.430 --> 06:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
then
 
06:05:28.368 --> 06:05:28.378 align:start position:0%
there were some Telegraph lines but
 
06:05:30.530 --> 06:05:30.540 align:start position:0%
mostly there were railroads and so the
 
06:05:32.930 --> 06:05:32.940 align:start position:0%
puc was fairly heavily involved with
 
06:05:35.628 --> 06:05:35.638 align:start position:0%
regulating railroads back then
 
06:05:40.070 --> 06:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
well they no longer regulate railroads
 
06:05:42.590 --> 06:05:42.600 align:start position:0%
and as all of you will recall two years
 
06:05:42.600 --> 06:05:43.610 align:start position:0%
and as all of you will recall two years
ago

06:05:43.610 --> 06:05:43.620 align:start position:0%
ago
 
06:05:45.830 --> 06:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission was
 
06:05:49.070 --> 06:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
broken up into a much smaller puc as we
 
06:05:51.410 --> 06:05:51.420 align:start position:0%
learned this morning and a department of
 
06:05:51.420 --> 06:05:52.368 align:start position:0%
learned this morning and a department of
energy

06:05:52.368 --> 06:05:52.378 align:start position:0%
energy
 
06:05:54.890 --> 06:05:54.900 align:start position:0%
and after that breakup happened
 
06:05:57.830 --> 06:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
it was necessary for both organizations
 
06:06:00.430 --> 06:06:00.440 align:start position:0%
to develop rules
 
06:06:04.150 --> 06:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
for the operation of their
 
06:06:07.670 --> 06:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
respective regulatory regimes
 
06:06:10.970 --> 06:06:10.980 align:start position:0%
and during the course of examining and
 
06:06:13.730 --> 06:06:13.740 align:start position:0%
planning the process of rewriting rules
 
06:06:15.948 --> 06:06:15.958 align:start position:0%
the POC discovered that they had a whole
 
06:06:17.030 --> 06:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
bunch of
 
06:06:19.430 --> 06:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
statutory obligations that they really
 
06:06:20.810 --> 06:06:20.820 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have
 
06:06:23.150 --> 06:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
so they asked me to file this bill to
 
06:06:23.160 --> 06:06:24.410 align:start position:0%
so they asked me to file this bill to
repeal

06:06:24.410 --> 06:06:24.420 align:start position:0%
repeal
 
06:06:24.420 --> 06:06:26.868 align:start position:0%
repeal
numerous

06:06:26.868 --> 06:06:26.878 align:start position:0%
numerous
 
06:06:30.948 --> 06:06:30.958 align:start position:0%
pieces of existing legislation
 
06:06:34.368 --> 06:06:34.378 align:start position:0%
so I sent the list to the office of
 
06:06:36.350 --> 06:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
legislative services
 
06:06:39.048 --> 06:06:39.058 align:start position:0%
and the drafting attorney who began work
 
06:06:40.548 --> 06:06:40.558 align:start position:0%
on the bill
 
06:06:43.310 --> 06:06:43.320 align:start position:0%
contacted me and he said are you sure
 
06:06:46.310 --> 06:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
you want to repeal all these because
 
06:06:48.288 --> 06:06:48.298 align:start position:0%
some of them look like they might still
 
06:06:50.930 --> 06:06:50.940 align:start position:0%
need to stay in existence
 
06:06:53.150 --> 06:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
however they may need to be transferred
 
06:06:56.690 --> 06:06:56.700 align:start position:0%
from the Public Utilities Commission to
 
06:06:59.270 --> 06:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
the Department of Transportation or
 
06:07:04.190 --> 06:07:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:08.448 --> 06:07:08.458 align:start position:0%
so he and I went through the list and we
 
06:07:10.788 --> 06:07:10.798 align:start position:0%
identified what we thought were likely
 
06:07:13.250 --> 06:07:13.260 align:start position:0%
candidates for repeal
 
06:07:17.628 --> 06:07:17.638 align:start position:0%
and then at his suggestion
 
06:07:21.048 --> 06:07:21.058 align:start position:0%
at the at the end of this bill on page
 
06:07:26.690 --> 06:07:26.700 align:start position:0%
four section four page 9 line 15 you'll
 
06:07:28.490 --> 06:07:28.500 align:start position:0%
notice that the bill creates a study
 
06:07:29.868 --> 06:07:29.878 align:start position:0%
committee and the study committee is
 
06:07:33.948 --> 06:07:33.958 align:start position:0%
charged with examining
 
06:07:36.230 --> 06:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
several other
 
06:07:36.240 --> 06:07:38.208 align:start position:0%
several other
uh

06:07:38.208 --> 06:07:38.218 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:07:40.730 --> 06:07:40.740 align:start position:0%
potential rsas to see if they should be
 
06:07:47.270 --> 06:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:50.570 --> 06:07:50.580 align:start position:0%
so the study committee is part of this
 
06:07:50.580 --> 06:07:53.208 align:start position:0%
so the study committee is part of this
bill

06:07:53.208 --> 06:07:53.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:55.670 --> 06:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
now since that time I've been contacted
 
06:07:58.430 --> 06:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
by a variety of sources
 
06:08:01.250 --> 06:08:01.260 align:start position:0%
and I've been told that
 
06:08:03.350 --> 06:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
if you look at the first page of the
 
06:08:08.330 --> 06:08:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:11.390 --> 06:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
numerous rsas are listed as being
 
06:08:11.400 --> 06:08:15.830 align:start position:0%
numerous rsas are listed as being
repealed

06:08:15.830 --> 06:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:19.670 --> 06:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
RSA 372 is
 
06:08:22.548 --> 06:08:22.558 align:start position:0%
about laying out railroads
 
06:08:26.390 --> 06:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
RSA 373 is about Crossings stations
 
06:08:29.990 --> 06:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
fences cattle guards Bridges and Bridge
 
06:08:30.000 --> 06:08:31.610 align:start position:0%
fences cattle guards Bridges and Bridge
guards

06:08:31.610 --> 06:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
guards
 
06:08:34.850 --> 06:08:34.860 align:start position:0%
RSA 380 is about railroads and fire
 
06:08:37.010 --> 06:08:37.020 align:start position:0%
damage and prevention
 
06:08:41.030 --> 06:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
RSA 228 is about railroad police
 
06:08:43.670 --> 06:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
and RSA 382 is about maintenance of
 
06:08:48.110 --> 06:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
parks by railroads and bus lines
 
06:08:50.930 --> 06:08:50.940 align:start position:0%
I've been advised and I think you'll
 
06:08:54.708 --> 06:08:54.718 align:start position:0%
hear people testify after me that these
 
06:08:58.010 --> 06:08:58.020 align:start position:0%
particular rsas should probably not be
 
06:09:01.430 --> 06:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
repealed but instead should be
 
06:09:01.440 --> 06:09:03.708 align:start position:0%
repealed but instead should be
reassigned

06:09:03.708 --> 06:09:03.718 align:start position:0%
reassigned
 
06:09:07.970 --> 06:09:07.980 align:start position:0%
or or redrafted to be part of a
 
06:09:09.590 --> 06:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
different department the responsibility
 
06:09:13.250 --> 06:09:13.260 align:start position:0%
of a different department for regulation
 
06:09:16.128 --> 06:09:16.138 align:start position:0%
so it's very likely that we'll need a
 
06:09:19.310 --> 06:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
an amendment to this bill to move those
 
06:09:22.190 --> 06:09:22.200 align:start position:0%
bills under the purview of the study
 
06:09:22.200 --> 06:09:23.270 align:start position:0%
bills under the purview of the study
committee

06:09:23.270 --> 06:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:09:26.270 --> 06:09:26.280 align:start position:0%
to have them figure out just exactly how
 
06:09:29.330 --> 06:09:29.340 align:start position:0%
to deal with those bills
 
06:09:31.128 --> 06:09:31.138 align:start position:0%
that will be in addition to the bills
 
06:09:32.868 --> 06:09:32.878 align:start position:0%
that are already listed
 
06:09:32.878 --> 06:09:35.330 align:start position:0%
that are already listed
on

06:09:35.330 --> 06:09:35.340 align:start position:0%

06:09:37.490 --> 06:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
page nine
 
06:09:37.500 --> 06:09:39.590 align:start position:0%
page nine
uh

06:09:39.590 --> 06:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:09:41.930 --> 06:09:41.940 align:start position:0%
lines 28
 
06:09:44.390 --> 06:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
or 27 through
 
06:09:51.830 --> 06:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
30. RSA 362 e RSA 367 RSA 368
 
06:09:54.890 --> 06:09:54.900 align:start position:0%
I would propose it will need to add 372
 
06:10:04.548 --> 06:10:04.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:07.190 --> 06:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
now the fiscal note that's attached to
 
06:10:09.110 --> 06:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:10:12.350 --> 06:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
is lengthy but it's totally inconclusive
 
06:10:16.270 --> 06:10:16.280 align:start position:0%
because all it is is a
 
06:10:16.280 --> 06:10:17.810 align:start position:0%
because all it is is a
copy

06:10:17.810 --> 06:10:17.820 align:start position:0%
copy
 
06:10:21.170 --> 06:10:21.180 align:start position:0%
of all the fines
 
06:10:24.770 --> 06:10:24.780 align:start position:0%
that the various rsas mentioned in the
 
06:10:24.780 --> 06:10:26.030 align:start position:0%
that the various rsas mentioned in the
bill

06:10:26.030 --> 06:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:10:28.390 --> 06:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
could it potentially
 
06:10:31.250 --> 06:10:31.260 align:start position:0%
provide for violations
 
06:10:34.910 --> 06:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
there's no way to know
 
06:10:38.570 --> 06:10:38.580 align:start position:0%
how many of these uh
 
06:10:41.390 --> 06:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
violations would actually happen
 
06:10:43.128 --> 06:10:43.138 align:start position:0%
there's no way of knowing how much
 
06:10:46.670 --> 06:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
revenue would actually be collected
 
06:10:52.670 --> 06:10:52.680 align:start position:0%
it is a nice list I guess to have of
 
06:10:52.680 --> 06:10:55.250 align:start position:0%
it is a nice list I guess to have of
possible

06:10:55.250 --> 06:10:55.260 align:start position:0%
possible
 
06:10:57.530 --> 06:10:57.540 align:start position:0%
fines that could be levied against
 
06:11:01.368 --> 06:11:01.378 align:start position:0%
people for various uh offenses in the
 
06:11:03.170 --> 06:11:03.180 align:start position:0%
state but it's not really relevant to
 
06:11:05.330 --> 06:11:05.340 align:start position:0%
the bill because there's no way of
 
06:11:06.530 --> 06:11:06.540 align:start position:0%
knowing how
 
06:11:10.548 --> 06:11:10.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:13.250 --> 06:11:13.260 align:start position:0%
so that's the substance of the bill
 
06:11:13.260 --> 06:11:15.048 align:start position:0%
so that's the substance of the bill
um

06:11:15.048 --> 06:11:15.058 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:11:17.510 --> 06:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
Michelle bunemeyer from the puc is here
 
06:11:19.970 --> 06:11:19.980 align:start position:0%
she will be testifying after me I
 
06:11:21.410 --> 06:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
believe there's someone who's going to
 
06:11:23.570 --> 06:11:23.580 align:start position:0%
be testifying from the Department of
 
06:11:26.510 --> 06:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
Transportation as well so there's lots
 
06:11:28.128 --> 06:11:28.138 align:start position:0%
more information that we'll be able to
 
06:11:30.650 --> 06:11:30.660 align:start position:0%
glean about this bill
 
06:11:32.390 --> 06:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
I think it's worthwhile to go forward
 
06:11:33.830 --> 06:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
with it
 
06:11:36.708 --> 06:11:36.718 align:start position:0%
in some fashion but obviously it'll be
 
06:11:39.350 --> 06:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
need to be amended before we come up
 
06:11:41.448 --> 06:11:41.458 align:start position:0%
with a final
 
06:11:44.090 --> 06:11:44.100 align:start position:0%
Bill to present
 
06:11:47.030 --> 06:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
for executive session and so that's my
 
06:11:48.410 --> 06:11:48.420 align:start position:0%
introduction to the bill with that I'll
 
06:11:50.030 --> 06:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
be happy to take questions
 
06:11:51.770 --> 06:11:51.780 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
06:11:54.410 --> 06:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Vose uh my only
 
06:11:56.030 --> 06:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
comment is that
 
06:11:57.830 --> 06:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
you take on quite an undertaking here
 
06:11:59.390 --> 06:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
06:12:01.548 --> 06:12:01.558 align:start position:0%
it's sort of like uh pulling one string
 
06:12:03.110 --> 06:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
and finding out there's more attached to
 
06:12:03.120 --> 06:12:04.190 align:start position:0%
and finding out there's more attached to
it

06:12:04.190 --> 06:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:12:06.110 --> 06:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
but I'll take a first question from
 
06:12:09.708 --> 06:12:09.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:13.368 --> 06:12:13.378 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr chair or acting chair so
 
06:12:15.350 --> 06:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
06:12:15.360 --> 06:12:16.030 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
um

06:12:16.030 --> 06:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:12:20.030 --> 06:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
you you you mentioned I think five of
 
06:12:23.150 --> 06:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
the original uh
 
06:12:28.010 --> 06:12:28.020 align:start position:0%
bills or RSA sections slotted for repeal
 
06:12:30.590 --> 06:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
now should go to the study committee I
 
06:12:32.170 --> 06:12:32.180 align:start position:0%
would just asked
 
06:12:36.470 --> 06:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh do you are you confident that any of
 
06:12:38.868 --> 06:12:38.878 align:start position:0%
the rsas that you've got slotted for
 
06:12:42.350 --> 06:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
repeal shouldn't have a second look
 
06:12:44.448 --> 06:12:44.458 align:start position:0%
just turn this all over to a study
 
06:12:46.610 --> 06:12:46.620 align:start position:0%
committee and say look at this whole
 
06:12:50.570 --> 06:12:50.580 align:start position:0%
basket and tell us what you think
 
06:12:53.570 --> 06:12:53.580 align:start position:0%
good question and the answer is I'm not
 
06:12:55.490 --> 06:12:55.500 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
06:12:57.650 --> 06:12:57.660 align:start position:0%
the remaining bills that were that I
 
06:13:01.430 --> 06:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
didn't mention from section one RSA 377
 
06:13:05.208 --> 06:13:05.218 align:start position:0%
3s RSA 379
 
06:13:10.010 --> 06:13:10.020 align:start position:0%
um RSA 376 actually RSA 376 is probably
 
06:13:13.430 --> 06:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
the one that should be uh repealed
 
06:13:16.128 --> 06:13:16.138 align:start position:0%
because it's reconstituted as chapter
 
06:13:21.770 --> 06:13:21.780 align:start position:0%
359 u in the uh section two of the bill
 
06:13:24.948 --> 06:13:24.958 align:start position:0%
that starts on line 17 and proceeds for
 
06:13:28.670 --> 06:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
the next half a dozen Pages yeah so that
 
06:13:31.190 --> 06:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
is the one bill in section one that I
 
06:13:33.170 --> 06:13:33.180 align:start position:0%
think is we can fairly confidently
 
06:13:36.708 --> 06:13:36.718 align:start position:0%
predict that we can repeal the others
 
06:13:39.470 --> 06:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
I no longer I haven't been notified that
 
06:13:41.690 --> 06:13:41.700 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't be repealed at this point
 
06:13:41.700 --> 06:13:43.368 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't be repealed at this point
but

06:13:43.368 --> 06:13:43.378 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:13:45.530 --> 06:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
I couldn't say definitively that they
 
06:13:47.930 --> 06:13:47.940 align:start position:0%
shouldn't so it is possible that they'd
 
06:13:49.490 --> 06:13:49.500 align:start position:0%
have to be added to the study committee
 
06:13:54.410 --> 06:13:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:56.510 --> 06:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
by the way I neglected to remember to
 
06:13:59.150 --> 06:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
mention when I handed over the gavel but
 
06:14:05.208 --> 06:14:05.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:07.070 --> 06:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
and I think all morning we didn't have
 
06:14:09.788 --> 06:14:09.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:13.310 --> 06:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
uh Miss uh representative Munds has a
 
06:14:13.320 --> 06:14:14.270 align:start position:0%
uh Miss uh representative Munds has a
question

06:14:14.270 --> 06:14:14.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:14:17.150 --> 06:14:17.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
06:14:19.910 --> 06:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
chair for taking my question
 
06:14:23.270 --> 06:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
um I I assume that if we were going to
 
06:14:25.690 --> 06:14:25.700 align:start position:0%
turn this into a study committee bill
 
06:14:29.030 --> 06:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
then none of the none of the rsas would
 
06:14:31.128 --> 06:14:31.138 align:start position:0%
be repealed by the effective date of
 
06:14:34.250 --> 06:14:34.260 align:start position:0%
July 1st 14 that would all be after the
 
06:14:35.930 --> 06:14:35.940 align:start position:0%
study committee the study committee
 
06:14:38.090 --> 06:14:38.100 align:start position:0%
would make a recommendation on when the
 
06:14:40.190 --> 06:14:40.200 align:start position:0%
repeals would go into effect
 
06:14:43.368 --> 06:14:43.378 align:start position:0%
yes that is correct thank you
 
06:14:46.010 --> 06:14:46.020 align:start position:0%
representative daughter has a question
 
06:14:48.288 --> 06:14:48.298 align:start position:0%
yes thank you look regarding the
 
06:14:51.048 --> 06:14:51.058 align:start position:0%
Antiquated rsas
 
06:14:53.690 --> 06:14:53.700 align:start position:0%
um I recall several terms ago as having
 
06:14:56.690 --> 06:14:56.700 align:start position:0%
a discussion about an Antiquated RSA
 
06:14:59.750 --> 06:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
that it was illegal to watch a train on
 
06:15:03.650 --> 06:15:03.660 align:start position:0%
watch a movie on the train on a Sunday
 
06:15:05.628 --> 06:15:05.638 align:start position:0%
I don't remember us ever repealing that
 
06:15:07.548 --> 06:15:07.558 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to guess that we did can
 
06:15:09.190 --> 06:15:09.200 align:start position:0%
you confirm that
 
06:15:12.110 --> 06:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
I have no idea I don't I don't remember
 
06:15:18.310 --> 06:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:20.570 --> 06:15:20.580 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
06:15:23.990 --> 06:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:26.288 --> 06:15:26.298 align:start position:0%
thank you I just am going I'm going to
 
06:15:29.750 --> 06:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
reinforce the the what seems to be a
 
06:15:32.150 --> 06:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
common uh discussion here about the
 
06:15:33.650 --> 06:15:33.660 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
06:15:35.930 --> 06:15:35.940 align:start position:0%
it seems that with the bill you might be
 
06:15:37.448 --> 06:15:37.458 align:start position:0%
putting the cart before the horse
 
06:15:41.090 --> 06:15:41.100 align:start position:0%
because if we repeal some of these and
 
06:15:43.010 --> 06:15:43.020 align:start position:0%
if we pass the bill and then set up a
 
06:15:44.390 --> 06:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
study committee and then the study
 
06:15:46.730 --> 06:15:46.740 align:start position:0%
committee makes the decision that some
 
06:15:48.230 --> 06:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
of these should not have been repealed
 
06:15:50.330 --> 06:15:50.340 align:start position:0%
then that means another another bill
 
06:15:52.850 --> 06:15:52.860 align:start position:0%
needs to be drafted correct
 
06:15:54.770 --> 06:15:54.780 align:start position:0%
yes that is correct that's why I said
 
06:15:58.090 --> 06:15:58.100 align:start position:0%
I'm not confident that the bills that
 
06:16:01.970 --> 06:16:01.980 align:start position:0%
I have identified for repeal here should
 
06:16:04.730 --> 06:16:04.740 align:start position:0%
stay on the list okay I'm hopeful that
 
06:16:07.610 --> 06:16:07.620 align:start position:0%
testimony will hear after mine will give
 
06:16:09.650 --> 06:16:09.660 align:start position:0%
us we'll shed some some light on that
 
06:16:13.010 --> 06:16:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:15.948 --> 06:16:15.958 align:start position:0%
representative partial your question
 
06:16:19.250 --> 06:16:19.260 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and uh I have a question
 
06:16:20.990 --> 06:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
on the study committee
 
06:16:23.048 --> 06:16:23.058 align:start position:0%
and membership
 
06:16:25.970 --> 06:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
and the question is basically if we had
 
06:16:27.830 --> 06:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
a study commission instead of a study
 
06:16:30.230 --> 06:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
committee would that welcome greater
 
06:16:31.850 --> 06:16:31.860 align:start position:0%
participation by the department of
 
06:16:31.860 --> 06:16:35.270 align:start position:0%
participation by the department of
energy

06:16:35.270 --> 06:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:35.280 --> 06:16:36.350 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:16:36.350 --> 06:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
06:16:39.650 --> 06:16:39.660 align:start position:0%
I suppose it would yes
 
06:16:43.190 --> 06:16:43.200 align:start position:0%
well reasonable suggestion I also
 
06:16:46.190 --> 06:16:46.200 align:start position:0%
noticed that there's no mention of any
 
06:16:49.850 --> 06:16:49.860 align:start position:0%
members of the sdna being part of the
 
06:16:51.948 --> 06:16:51.958 align:start position:0%
contingent of four members from the
 
06:16:54.590 --> 06:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
House of Representatives I I might like
 
06:16:57.288 --> 06:16:57.298 align:start position:0%
to see that added as well
 
06:16:57.298 --> 06:16:58.910 align:start position:0%
to see that added as well
follow-up

06:16:58.910 --> 06:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
06:17:01.490 --> 06:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
I would only urge you to consider as
 
06:17:03.948 --> 06:17:03.958 align:start position:0%
much but I suppose while we're at it
 
06:17:05.270 --> 06:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps there needs to be somebody from
 
06:17:07.430 --> 06:17:07.440 align:start position:0%
the Department of Transportation on here
 
06:17:11.590 --> 06:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
as well I don't know they were building
 
06:17:19.510 --> 06:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:23.448 --> 06:17:23.458 align:start position:0%
question please and thank you chair uh
 
06:17:25.670 --> 06:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question chair I
 
06:17:28.730 --> 06:17:28.740 align:start position:0%
had this so I waited to the end
 
06:17:32.448 --> 06:17:32.458 align:start position:0%
um talking to a constituent now on
 
06:17:37.010 --> 06:17:37.020 align:start position:0%
I always say 372 regarding upkeep of
 
06:17:39.048 --> 06:17:39.058 align:start position:0%
railroad fences on his property to keep
 
06:17:42.110 --> 06:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
the cattle in so actually I'm active
 
06:17:44.570 --> 06:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
with that now so that one should not be
 
06:17:47.270 --> 06:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
repealed so that's one example thank you
 
06:17:47.280 --> 06:17:49.628 align:start position:0%
repealed so that's one example thank you
yes

06:17:49.628 --> 06:17:49.638 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:17:52.030 --> 06:17:52.040 align:start position:0%
RSA 37
 
06:17:56.270 --> 06:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
373 should not be on the repeal list
 
06:17:58.250 --> 06:17:58.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:17:58.260 --> 06:17:59.690 align:start position:0%
thank you
I

06:17:59.690 --> 06:17:59.700 align:start position:0%
I
 
06:18:02.990 --> 06:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
I think I have a question for you um
 
06:18:03.000 --> 06:18:04.670 align:start position:0%
I think I have a question for you um
just

06:18:04.670 --> 06:18:04.680 align:start position:0%
just
 
06:18:08.330 --> 06:18:08.340 align:start position:0%
curious if any of these repeals of the
 
06:18:10.070 --> 06:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
railroad regulations here would they
 
06:18:13.310 --> 06:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
have any effect whatsoever on any of the
 
06:18:17.090 --> 06:18:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:19.490 --> 06:18:19.500 align:start position:0%
good question have no idea possibly
 
06:18:21.650 --> 06:18:21.660 align:start position:0%
somebody behind me can shed some light
 
06:18:23.090 --> 06:18:23.100 align:start position:0%
on that question
 
06:18:25.250 --> 06:18:25.260 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
06:18:27.650 --> 06:18:27.660 align:start position:0%
without seeing no other questions thank
 
06:18:29.750 --> 06:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
you very much for your very enlightening
 
06:18:34.548 --> 06:18:34.558 align:start position:0%
con uh testimony chairman Vose and I
 
06:18:39.970 --> 06:18:39.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:44.390 --> 06:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:03.048 --> 06:19:03.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:05.390 --> 06:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
start again my name is Michelle
 
06:19:07.670 --> 06:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
bunemeyer I am a staff attorney at the
 
06:19:10.070 --> 06:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission and I am
 
06:19:12.288 --> 06:19:12.298 align:start position:0%
here to testify regarding section one of
 
06:19:13.128 --> 06:19:13.138 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
06:19:16.310 --> 06:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
and representative Bose is correct that
 
06:19:19.788 --> 06:19:19.798 align:start position:0%
we had submitted a list of bills not
 
06:19:21.890 --> 06:19:21.900 align:start position:0%
necessarily to be repealed just that
 
06:19:24.530 --> 06:19:24.540 align:start position:0%
they didn't have anything to do with
 
06:19:28.430 --> 06:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
Current public utilities regulation so
 
06:19:30.770 --> 06:19:30.780 align:start position:0%
our purpose was just to suggest a
 
06:19:34.310 --> 06:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
possible cleanup of title 34 which is
 
06:19:37.670 --> 06:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
entitled Public Utilities but it does
 
06:19:40.010 --> 06:19:40.020 align:start position:0%
contain a number of statutes that do not
 
06:19:42.170 --> 06:19:42.180 align:start position:0%
relate to the current regulation of
 
06:19:43.850 --> 06:19:43.860 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities such as the railroad
 
06:19:43.860 --> 06:19:45.948 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities such as the railroad
statutes

06:19:45.948 --> 06:19:45.958 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
06:19:45.958 --> 06:19:46.670 align:start position:0%
statutes
um

06:19:46.670 --> 06:19:46.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:19:49.310 --> 06:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
the authority to regulate railroads has
 
06:19:52.010 --> 06:19:52.020 align:start position:0%
been primarily vested in other agencies
 
06:19:54.410 --> 06:19:54.420 align:start position:0%
and not the puc
 
06:19:57.470 --> 06:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
so the puc proposed this bill as a way
 
06:20:00.410 --> 06:20:00.420 align:start position:0%
of eliminating various extraneous
 
06:20:05.030 --> 06:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
statutes from chapter from title 34
 
06:20:07.970 --> 06:20:07.980 align:start position:0%
which are no longer related to Public
 
06:20:09.890 --> 06:20:09.900 align:start position:0%
Utilities regulation
 
06:20:12.470 --> 06:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
so we are in favor of the first section
 
06:20:14.628 --> 06:20:14.638 align:start position:0%
of the bill which I understand may be
 
06:20:17.150 --> 06:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
amended but we take no position on
 
06:20:21.830 --> 06:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:23.990 --> 06:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
06:20:29.690 --> 06:20:29.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:32.270 --> 06:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
oh seeing none thank you very much
 
06:20:35.448 --> 06:20:35.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:38.750 --> 06:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
last pink card I have unless anyone
 
06:20:42.708 --> 06:20:42.718 align:start position:0%
fills out any others is uh Mr Brier from
 
06:20:44.750 --> 06:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
the Department of Dot
 
06:20:44.760 --> 06:20:46.310 align:start position:0%
the Department of Dot
transportation

06:20:46.310 --> 06:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
06:20:49.010 --> 06:20:49.020 align:start position:0%
did I pronounce that correct
 
06:20:52.070 --> 06:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
spot on Mr chair that was perfect thank
 
06:20:52.080 --> 06:20:53.570 align:start position:0%
spot on Mr chair that was perfect thank
you

06:20:53.570 --> 06:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:20:55.910 --> 06:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
as as the chairman stated I'm Andre
 
06:20:58.430 --> 06:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
Brier a Deputy Commissioner Department
 
06:21:00.830 --> 06:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
of Transportation I'm joined here with
 
06:21:02.868 --> 06:21:02.878 align:start position:0%
Miss Shelley Winters who's the director
 
06:21:05.810 --> 06:21:05.820 align:start position:0%
of Aviation Rail and Transit I think
 
06:21:08.330 --> 06:21:08.340 align:start position:0%
chairman Vos uh very succinctly and
 
06:21:10.670 --> 06:21:10.680 align:start position:0%
correctly noted uh the objections that
 
06:21:14.510 --> 06:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
we do have I would even uh say that if
 
06:21:16.430 --> 06:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
those sections do get referred to the
 
06:21:19.368 --> 06:21:19.378 align:start position:0%
study committee we will withdraw our our
 
06:21:21.590 --> 06:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
opposition uh because that's that's why
 
06:21:23.810 --> 06:21:23.820 align:start position:0%
we're here we do have a letter that you
 
06:21:25.070 --> 06:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
see before you
 
06:21:29.570 --> 06:21:29.580 align:start position:0%
from uh chairman Jim jalbert from the
 
06:21:31.310 --> 06:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Transportation Council who
 
06:21:33.530 --> 06:21:33.540 align:start position:0%
recommends a course of action identical
 
06:21:36.110 --> 06:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
uh to what chairman Vose laid out to you
 
06:21:38.690 --> 06:21:38.700 align:start position:0%
so as long as those rsas are not
 
06:21:38.700 --> 06:21:39.770 align:start position:0%
so as long as those rsas are not
repealed

06:21:39.770 --> 06:21:39.780 align:start position:0%
repealed
 
06:21:42.170 --> 06:21:42.180 align:start position:0%
we're fine with the bill that that's our
 
06:21:44.510 --> 06:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
only objection it would have the effect
 
06:21:47.090 --> 06:21:47.100 align:start position:0%
of eliminating our ability to regulate
 
06:21:49.850 --> 06:21:49.860 align:start position:0%
rails in the state so we were obviously
 
06:21:51.650 --> 06:21:51.660 align:start position:0%
concerned about that
 
06:21:51.660 --> 06:21:52.970 align:start position:0%
concerned about that
but

06:21:52.970 --> 06:21:52.980 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:21:55.070 --> 06:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
we are fully supportive of the notion
 
06:21:57.288 --> 06:21:57.298 align:start position:0%
that these should fall under rsas more
 
06:21:59.448 --> 06:21:59.458 align:start position:0%
appropriate to the Department of
 
06:21:59.458 --> 06:22:01.490 align:start position:0%
appropriate to the Department of
Transportation

06:22:01.490 --> 06:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
Transportation
 
06:22:03.948 --> 06:22:03.958 align:start position:0%
representative man's the question
 
06:22:06.230 --> 06:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
06:22:07.670 --> 06:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
06:22:07.680 --> 06:22:09.470 align:start position:0%
coming in
um

06:22:09.470 --> 06:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:22:12.890 --> 06:22:12.900 align:start position:0%
is is dot responsible for railroads now
 
06:22:14.150 --> 06:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
we are sir
 
06:22:17.090 --> 06:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
 
06:22:21.048 --> 06:22:21.058 align:start position:0%
so given that you're responsible but the
 
06:22:23.510 --> 06:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
legislation says the puc is responsible
 
06:22:26.030 --> 06:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit of a problem isn't
 
06:22:26.040 --> 06:22:26.810 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit of a problem isn't
it

06:22:26.810 --> 06:22:26.820 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:22:31.250 --> 06:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
it is and it's it's a relic of a former
 
06:22:33.410 --> 06:22:33.420 align:start position:0%
um administrative configuration
 
06:22:33.420 --> 06:22:35.330 align:start position:0%
um administrative configuration
whereby

06:22:35.330 --> 06:22:35.340 align:start position:0%
whereby
 
06:22:37.910 --> 06:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
we were linked thank you
 
06:22:39.590 --> 06:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
representative Winnie Thomas has a
 
06:22:41.930 --> 06:22:41.940 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair
 
06:22:44.330 --> 06:22:44.340 align:start position:0%
um regarding an earlier question do any
 
06:22:46.788 --> 06:22:46.798 align:start position:0%
of these rsas cover our rail trails at
 
06:22:46.798 --> 06:22:47.868 align:start position:0%
of these rsas cover our rail trails at
all

06:22:47.868 --> 06:22:47.878 align:start position:0%
all
 
06:22:49.730 --> 06:22:49.740 align:start position:0%
so by implication when you talk about
 
06:22:53.390 --> 06:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
Crossings you know we maintain all rail
 
06:22:55.970 --> 06:22:55.980 align:start position:0%
trails are on uh I won't say that I'll
 
06:22:57.708 --> 06:22:57.718 align:start position:0%
say most rail trails are on inactive
 
06:22:59.628 --> 06:22:59.638 align:start position:0%
state-owned track
 
06:23:03.230 --> 06:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
um so we maintain the trackage uh
 
06:23:05.510 --> 06:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
corridors in the event that at any
 
06:23:08.090 --> 06:23:08.100 align:start position:0%
future Point rail is re-established
 
06:23:10.250 --> 06:23:10.260 align:start position:0%
that's why dot retains ownership of
 
06:23:12.530 --> 06:23:12.540 align:start position:0%
those corridors
 
06:23:16.490 --> 06:23:16.500 align:start position:0%
we do have they are managed portions are
 
06:23:19.190 --> 06:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
managed by other agencies but uh but but
 
06:23:23.868 --> 06:23:23.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:26.448 --> 06:23:26.458 align:start position:0%
remember so representative partial
 
06:23:27.770 --> 06:23:27.780 align:start position:0%
yes thank you chair and thank you for
 
06:23:28.970 --> 06:23:28.980 align:start position:0%
taking the question thank you for being
 
06:23:31.430 --> 06:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
here today could you tell me we have a
 
06:23:34.250 --> 06:23:34.260 align:start position:0%
10-year plan which includes uh rail
 
06:23:36.530 --> 06:23:36.540 align:start position:0%
service along the I believe it's called
 
06:23:38.150 --> 06:23:38.160 align:start position:0%
the capital Corridor we were just
 
06:23:41.270 --> 06:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
testifying to that effect okay and uh if
 
06:23:43.910 --> 06:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
these particular uh Clauses were
 
06:23:43.920 --> 06:23:45.708 align:start position:0%
these particular uh Clauses were
rescinded

06:23:45.708 --> 06:23:45.718 align:start position:0%
rescinded
 
06:23:47.270 --> 06:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
um could you see that having a direct
 
06:23:49.610 --> 06:23:49.620 align:start position:0%
effect on the capital quarter almost
 
06:23:53.930 --> 06:23:53.940 align:start position:0%
certainly uh the capital quarter itself
 
06:23:57.288 --> 06:23:57.298 align:start position:0%
as Ms Winters and I just testified we
 
06:23:59.690 --> 06:23:59.700 align:start position:0%
completed the preliminary design uh
 
06:24:02.448 --> 06:24:02.458 align:start position:0%
phase of that project just this week so
 
06:24:04.788 --> 06:24:04.798 align:start position:0%
that was 31 January our consultant
 
06:24:07.368 --> 06:24:07.378 align:start position:0%
provided us a draft report we'll be
 
06:24:09.110 --> 06:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
providing that to the legislature in the
 
06:24:11.030 --> 06:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
in coming weeks
 
06:24:14.990 --> 06:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
um this you know these rsas here uh you
 
06:24:16.430 --> 06:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
know while they're not
 
06:24:19.548 --> 06:24:19.558 align:start position:0%
the totality of our authorities uh it's
 
06:24:21.590 --> 06:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
a big chunk of authorities to maintain
 
06:24:22.850 --> 06:24:22.860 align:start position:0%
and regulate railroads that are
 
06:24:24.590 --> 06:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
represented by these rsas we do have
 
06:24:28.850 --> 06:24:28.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:32.750 --> 06:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
uh I have a question just for clarity so
 
06:24:39.230 --> 06:24:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:40.990 --> 06:24:41.000 align:start position:0%
okay one second I'll finish my question
 
06:24:44.930 --> 06:24:44.940 align:start position:0%
uh was testifying that uh she had no
 
06:24:47.150 --> 06:24:47.160 align:start position:0%
problem with Section one would would
 
06:24:50.208 --> 06:24:50.218 align:start position:0%
section one also be included in any uh
 
06:24:53.690 --> 06:24:53.700 align:start position:0%
study that that you would approve of
 
06:24:57.770 --> 06:24:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:01.310 --> 06:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
yeah well if section one includes uh
 
06:25:04.910 --> 06:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
Roman one then yeah those are those are
 
06:25:07.788 --> 06:25:07.798 align:start position:0%
all rsas that we'd be interested in
 
06:25:10.430 --> 06:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
referring to the study committee
 
06:25:12.170 --> 06:25:12.180 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
06:25:14.810 --> 06:25:14.820 align:start position:0%
yeah this Line's essentially on the
 
06:25:18.048 --> 06:25:18.058 align:start position:0%
legislation lines two through fifteen uh
 
06:25:20.810 --> 06:25:20.820 align:start position:0%
all of those rsas we need to uh to
 
06:25:20.820 --> 06:25:23.750 align:start position:0%
all of those rsas we need to uh to
reassign

06:25:23.750 --> 06:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:25.670 --> 06:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
representative munz as just as your
 
06:25:26.868 --> 06:25:26.878 align:start position:0%
second question
 
06:25:30.230 --> 06:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so if we know if if
 
06:25:34.548 --> 06:25:34.558 align:start position:0%
if you know that these rsas
 
06:25:34.558 --> 06:25:36.530 align:start position:0%
if you know that these rsas
are

06:25:36.530 --> 06:25:36.540 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:25:36.540 --> 06:25:37.368 align:start position:0%
are
um

06:25:37.368 --> 06:25:37.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:25:40.430 --> 06:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
your responsibility why do we need a
 
06:25:42.110 --> 06:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
study committee can't we just re-codify
 
06:25:45.708 --> 06:25:45.718 align:start position:0%
them as we did with the with RSA 372
 
06:25:47.570 --> 06:25:47.580 align:start position:0%
we do have recommendations where they
 
06:25:50.150 --> 06:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
could go yes sir uh we we could provide
 
06:25:51.890 --> 06:25:51.900 align:start position:0%
you those answers if you'd like to
 
06:25:53.868 --> 06:25:53.878 align:start position:0%
directly do that
 
06:25:55.850 --> 06:25:55.860 align:start position:0%
um there could be I I guess my only
 
06:25:57.948 --> 06:25:57.958 align:start position:0%
caution there would be
 
06:25:59.990 --> 06:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
there are other agencies potentially
 
06:26:01.970 --> 06:26:01.980 align:start position:0%
involved with this that that may benefit
 
06:26:03.890 --> 06:26:03.900 align:start position:0%
from a study committee
 
06:26:05.868 --> 06:26:05.878 align:start position:0%
yeah Department of Safety being primary
 
06:26:08.330 --> 06:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
with railroad police we of course do not
 
06:26:10.548 --> 06:26:10.558 align:start position:0%
uh maintain law enforcement Authority on
 
06:26:12.350 --> 06:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
the railroads so that would be a
 
06:26:14.510 --> 06:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
department of safety so I wouldn't want
 
06:26:16.910 --> 06:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
to speak for them uh in that sense a
 
06:26:21.830 --> 06:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:25.010 --> 06:26:25.020 align:start position:0%
um so so like we said earlier a
 
06:26:26.510 --> 06:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
commission might be the best way to go
 
06:26:28.190 --> 06:26:28.200 align:start position:0%
because then we could make sure we got
 
06:26:31.010 --> 06:26:31.020 align:start position:0%
involved active involvement from all the
 
06:26:32.390 --> 06:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
necessary government we certainly
 
06:26:34.850 --> 06:26:34.860 align:start position:0%
endorse that yes sir thank you
 
06:26:36.230 --> 06:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much so you know other
 
06:26:37.850 --> 06:26:37.860 align:start position:0%

06:26:40.070 --> 06:26:40.080 align:start position:0%

06:26:45.708 --> 06:26:45.718 align:start position:0%

06:26:50.868 --> 06:26:50.878 align:start position:0%
additional speaker Mr Peter bragner from
 
06:26:54.110 --> 06:26:54.120 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman I prefer to call
 
06:27:04.788 --> 06:27:04.798 align:start position:0%
it recovery recovering Senator it's
 
06:27:06.830 --> 06:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
probably a better way to face it so good
 
06:27:08.150 --> 06:27:08.160 align:start position:0%
to see some of my friends from uh
 
06:27:09.890 --> 06:27:09.900 align:start position:0%
Merrimack here in the former District
 
06:27:12.770 --> 06:27:12.780 align:start position:0%
11. uh for the record Peter Bragdon uh
 
06:27:13.970 --> 06:27:13.980 align:start position:0%
senior policy advisor with pretty
 
06:27:16.548 --> 06:27:16.558 align:start position:0%
strategies uh here representing CSX
 
06:27:18.350 --> 06:27:18.360 align:start position:0%
Railways and just here to support the
 
06:27:20.090 --> 06:27:20.100 align:start position:0%
Department's efforts on especially
 
06:27:22.730 --> 06:27:22.740 align:start position:0%
section one of the bill uh which seeks
 
06:27:24.530 --> 06:27:24.540 align:start position:0%
to repeal a number of statutes CSX
 
06:27:25.730 --> 06:27:25.740 align:start position:0%
Railways recently completed the
 
06:27:27.470 --> 06:27:27.480 align:start position:0%
acquisition of Pan Am Railways and is
 
06:27:30.470 --> 06:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
fairly new to the state and uh who knew
 
06:27:32.390 --> 06:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
that the Public Utilities Commission
 
06:27:35.150 --> 06:27:35.160 align:start position:0%
statutes affected railroads like this so
 
06:27:37.430 --> 06:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
we found out about this bill a week or
 
06:27:39.650 --> 06:27:39.660 align:start position:0%
two ago and really haven't had the time
 
06:27:42.350 --> 06:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
to study exactly how these particular
 
06:27:45.830 --> 06:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
pieces being repealed might affect us so
 
06:27:48.350 --> 06:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
it's our understanding that the goal is
 
06:27:50.750 --> 06:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
to take these repeals and turn them into
 
06:27:52.850 --> 06:27:52.860 align:start position:0%
a study commission we we fully support
 
06:27:54.650 --> 06:27:54.660 align:start position:0%
that gives everybody time to figure out
 
06:27:56.868 --> 06:27:56.878 align:start position:0%
okay exactly what is needed what needs
 
06:27:58.850 --> 06:27:58.860 align:start position:0%
to stay and What needs to disappear so
 
06:28:01.490 --> 06:28:01.500 align:start position:0%
supportive of that effort and echoing
 
06:28:04.250 --> 06:28:04.260 align:start position:0%

representative McWilliams
 
07:05:41.208 --> 07:05:41.218 align:start position:0%
for the record I'd like to say that I
 
07:05:42.948 --> 07:05:42.958 align:start position:0%
believe that this bill bill was well
 
07:05:45.410 --> 07:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
intended I would like to think the best
 
07:05:47.390 --> 07:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
of the Bill's sponsor and thank him for
 
07:05:49.490 --> 07:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
presenting and bringing this to our
 
07:05:51.948 --> 07:05:51.958 align:start position:0%
attention however we heard quite a bit
 
07:05:53.810 --> 07:05:53.820 align:start position:0%
of testimony that it would not be
 
07:05:56.750 --> 07:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
possible constitutionally to do what the
 
07:05:59.208 --> 07:05:59.218 align:start position:0%
bill sets out to do and so therefore I
 
07:06:00.468 --> 07:06:00.478 align:start position:0%
don't think there's any way that we can
 
07:06:04.128 --> 07:06:04.138 align:start position:0%
work with it but we do appreciate the
 
07:06:05.448 --> 07:06:05.458 align:start position:0%
bringing the bill and the discussion
 
07:06:07.750 --> 07:06:07.760 align:start position:0%

bill there was no fiscal note

to pass the bill that we don't know what
 
07:09:19.610 --> 07:09:19.620 align:start position:0%

um as part of our discussion on House
 
07:09:34.730 --> 07:09:34.740 align:start position:0%
Bill 630 there were some concerns raised
 
07:09:34.740 --> 07:09:36.110 align:start position:0%
Bill 630 there were some concerns raised
about

07:09:36.110 --> 07:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
about
 
07:09:37.548 --> 07:09:37.558 align:start position:0%
um if there would be any administrative
 
07:09:39.468 --> 07:09:39.478 align:start position:0%
costs that were shifted onto the state
 
07:09:41.390 --> 07:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
rather than could be used from federal
 
07:09:46.730 --> 07:09:46.740 align:start position:0%
funds for a green bank and so um I know
 
07:09:47.890 --> 07:09:47.900 align:start position:0%
that's not germane to this current
 
07:09:51.110 --> 07:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
discussion but uh Mr representative
 
07:09:52.670 --> 07:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
Harrington and I worked on an amendment
 
07:09:54.770 --> 07:09:54.780 align:start position:0%
to make sure that uh to the extent
 
07:09:57.110 --> 07:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
possible all federal funds would be used
 
07:09:58.788 --> 07:09:58.798 align:start position:0%
to cover administrative costs including
 
07:10:00.468 --> 07:10:00.478 align:start position:0%
hiring somebody who needed to work for
 
07:10:03.708 --> 07:10:03.718 align:start position:0%
Des to manage it if necessary so if this
 
07:10:05.150 --> 07:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
motion fails I'd be happy to bring
 
07:10:07.090 --> 07:10:07.100 align:start position:0%
forward an amendment but for the record
 
07:10:10.190 --> 07:10:10.200 align:start position:0%
the goal here is not to cost a dime to
 
07:10:11.690 --> 07:10:11.700 align:start position:0%
the state but rather to be able to
 
07:10:13.910 --> 07:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
direct how money is spent that comes
 
07:10:15.350 --> 07:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
from the FED to the state of New
 
07:10:17.628 --> 07:10:17.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as part of the infrastructure
 
07:10:19.368 --> 07:10:19.378 align:start position:0%
reinvestment act I want to be very clear
 
07:10:21.110 --> 07:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
that this is about guiding and
 
07:10:22.670 --> 07:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
controlling the money rather than
 
07:10:24.590 --> 07:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
leaving it to non-profits and other
 
07:10:26.628 --> 07:10:26.638 align:start position:0%
smaller agencies who may go for small
 
07:10:28.968 --> 07:10:28.978 align:start position:0%
parts of it whereas our department of
 
07:10:33.110 --> 07:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:38.090 --> 07:10:38.100 align:start position:0%
further discussion on House Bill 630
 
07:10:41.570 --> 07:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
representative muns thank you Mr chair I
 
07:10:43.430 --> 07:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
just would like to follow up on what
 
07:10:45.590 --> 07:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams said to and
 
07:10:48.650 --> 07:10:48.660 align:start position:0%
remind everyone that we heard testimony
 
07:10:51.890 --> 07:10:51.900 align:start position:0%
that there is 27 billion dollars in
 
07:10:54.410 --> 07:10:54.420 align:start position:0%
federal money that's going to be
 
07:10:58.430 --> 07:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
available for projects such as this and
 
07:11:01.010 --> 07:11:01.020 align:start position:0%
this would give us the ability to make
 
07:11:02.628 --> 07:11:02.638 align:start position:0%
sure that New Hampshire doesn't lose out
 
07:11:05.468 --> 07:11:05.478 align:start position:0%
on any of that funding
 
07:11:08.628 --> 07:11:08.638 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas has a comment
 
07:11:11.150 --> 07:11:11.160 align:start position:0%
or sorry representative Bernardi has a
 
07:11:11.160 --> 07:11:12.350 align:start position:0%
or sorry representative Bernardi has a
comment

07:11:12.350 --> 07:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
comment
 
07:11:15.708 --> 07:11:15.718 align:start position:0%
yes uh uh the department of energy would
 
07:11:17.628 --> 07:11:17.638 align:start position:0%
get this money no matter what and
 
07:11:20.930 --> 07:11:20.940 align:start position:0%
Department of energy could can move this
 
07:11:24.288 --> 07:11:24.298 align:start position:0%
to uh one of several financial
 
07:11:27.288 --> 07:11:27.298 align:start position:0%
institutions already exists so we're not
 
07:11:30.110 --> 07:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
going to lose any money by not adopting
 
07:11:33.128 --> 07:11:33.138 align:start position:0%
this bill we don't need to create a new
 
07:11:37.628 --> 07:11:37.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:44.690 --> 07:11:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:47.570 --> 07:11:47.580 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:49.548 --> 07:11:49.558 align:start position:0%
representative munz has another comment
 
07:11:51.170 --> 07:11:51.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
07:11:53.570 --> 07:11:53.580 align:start position:0%
um I I thought what I heard from the
 
07:11:56.208 --> 07:11:56.218 align:start position:0%
Department of energy or uh I'm not sure
 
07:11:57.530 --> 07:11:57.540 align:start position:0%
if it was the department of energy but
 
07:12:00.230 --> 07:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
one somebody that testified that the 27
 
07:12:01.670 --> 07:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
billion dollars was available
 
07:12:05.570 --> 07:12:05.580 align:start position:0%
specifically for Green Bank funding
 
07:12:11.628 --> 07:12:11.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:14.330 --> 07:12:14.340 align:start position:0%
foreign maybe it would be appropriate
 
07:12:16.190 --> 07:12:16.200 align:start position:0%
since we have a representative of the
 
07:12:18.350 --> 07:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
Department of energy here to ask him
 
07:12:20.030 --> 07:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
that question
 
07:12:22.310 --> 07:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
could you clarify for us we have some
 
07:12:23.990 --> 07:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
confusion here
 
07:12:27.530 --> 07:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
Mr Roberts about whether or not
 
07:12:31.368 --> 07:12:31.378 align:start position:0%
the department of energy can accept
 
07:12:35.208 --> 07:12:35.218 align:start position:0%
any or all of this money without the
 
07:12:40.128 --> 07:12:40.138 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:42.350 --> 07:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee uh
 
07:12:43.968 --> 07:12:43.978 align:start position:0%
Griffin Roberge from the New Hampshire
 
07:12:47.270 --> 07:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
Department of energy I was not here when
 
07:12:50.330 --> 07:12:50.340 align:start position:0%
House Bill 630 uh was uh had its public
 
07:12:53.570 --> 07:12:53.580 align:start position:0%
hearing our policy and programs division
 
07:12:55.610 --> 07:12:55.620 align:start position:0%
director Josh Elliott was I know he
 
07:12:57.770 --> 07:12:57.780 align:start position:0%
followed up with the committee uh with
 
07:13:00.128 --> 07:13:00.138 align:start position:0%
an email I think Thursday morning
 
07:13:02.868 --> 07:13:02.878 align:start position:0%
detailing the three different buckets
 
07:13:05.330 --> 07:13:05.340 align:start position:0%
that are available through this uh large
 
07:13:08.930 --> 07:13:08.940 align:start position:0%
program that's managed out of the IRA
 
07:13:11.448 --> 07:13:11.458 align:start position:0%
um they're a bear with me There's 7
 
07:13:13.190 --> 07:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
billion available for zero emission
 
07:13:15.250 --> 07:13:15.260 align:start position:0%
Technologies that's open to States
 
07:13:17.570 --> 07:13:17.580 align:start position:0%
municipalities tribal governments and
 
07:13:20.150 --> 07:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
eligible recipients and I'll we'll go
 
07:13:21.708 --> 07:13:21.718 align:start position:0%
back to eligible recipients here in a
 
07:13:23.750 --> 07:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
moment there's about 12 billion for
 
07:13:25.690 --> 07:13:25.700 align:start position:0%
general assistance and 8 billion for
 
07:13:28.788 --> 07:13:28.798 align:start position:0%
low-income low-income and disadvantaged
 
07:13:31.670 --> 07:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
communities an eligible recipient in
 
07:13:34.250 --> 07:13:34.260 align:start position:0%
those three pots is viewed quite broadly
 
07:13:37.930 --> 07:13:37.940 align:start position:0%
it can include a non-profit organization
 
07:13:40.490 --> 07:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
that can design and provide cap Capital
 
07:13:43.368 --> 07:13:43.378 align:start position:0%
leverage private capital and that type
 
07:13:45.530 --> 07:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
of thing
 
07:13:47.690 --> 07:13:47.700 align:start position:0%
there are suggestions that state created
 
07:13:49.910 --> 07:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
entity contemplated by this legislation
 
07:13:52.010 --> 07:13:52.020 align:start position:0%
could be eligible to apply to some of
 
07:13:54.708 --> 07:13:54.718 align:start position:0%
these buckets but until more Federal
 
07:13:56.448 --> 07:13:56.458 align:start position:0%
guidance is fleshed out for these
 
07:13:59.270 --> 07:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
programs there is nothing definitive at
 
07:14:01.850 --> 07:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
this time the IRA for context was signed
 
07:14:05.270 --> 07:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
into law in August of last year and they
 
07:14:06.410 --> 07:14:06.420 align:start position:0%
are and the federal government
 
07:14:07.968 --> 07:14:07.978 align:start position:0%
specifically the U.S department of
 
07:14:10.310 --> 07:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
energy and the EPA are still developing
 
07:14:12.910 --> 07:14:12.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of guidance on these programs
 
07:14:15.048 --> 07:14:15.058 align:start position:0%
regarding whether or not this funding
 
07:14:16.968 --> 07:14:16.978 align:start position:0%
could be used for staff the federal
 
07:14:18.708 --> 07:14:18.718 align:start position:0%
statute does not go into detail about
 
07:14:23.030 --> 07:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
every last eligible use for the funds in
 
07:14:24.468 --> 07:14:24.478 align:start position:0%
fact the language enabling this program
 
07:14:27.468 --> 07:14:27.478 align:start position:0%
is just over two pages long so a lot of
 
07:14:29.270 --> 07:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
this needs to be fleshed out with rules
 
07:14:30.708 --> 07:14:30.718 align:start position:0%
and federal guidance issued by the
 
07:14:32.708 --> 07:14:32.718 align:start position:0%
federal agencies themselves
 
07:14:36.170 --> 07:14:36.180 align:start position:0%
reading from Josh's email by virtue of
 
07:14:37.490 --> 07:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
this program being created through the
 
07:14:39.948 --> 07:14:39.958 align:start position:0%
reconciliation process only Provisions
 
07:14:41.330 --> 07:14:41.340 align:start position:0%
related to the Appropriations were
 
07:14:42.590 --> 07:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
allowed to be part of the language of
 
07:14:44.930 --> 07:14:44.940 align:start position:0%
the bill so there's much left to the EPA
 
07:14:46.368 --> 07:14:46.378 align:start position:0%
to fill in the blank when it comes to
 
07:14:49.010 --> 07:14:49.020 align:start position:0%
drafting guidance documents all the
 
07:14:50.810 --> 07:14:50.820 align:start position:0%
wording presumes that there will be
 
07:14:52.610 --> 07:14:52.620 align:start position:0%
administrative costs incurred by the
 
07:14:55.490 --> 07:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
recipients for these grants
 
07:14:58.490 --> 07:14:58.500 align:start position:0%
but given but uh yeah I guess in that in
 
07:14:58.500 --> 07:14:59.390 align:start position:0%
but given but uh yeah I guess in that in
that

07:14:59.390 --> 07:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:15:01.670 --> 07:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
to be quite broad with it is that a lot
 
07:15:03.110 --> 07:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
of guidance still needs to be developed
 
07:15:05.868 --> 07:15:05.878 align:start position:0%
before we can anticipate how these funds
 
07:15:08.208 --> 07:15:08.218 align:start position:0%
may be used
 
07:15:11.810 --> 07:15:11.820 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:14.628 --> 07:15:14.638 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas has a question uh
 
07:15:17.030 --> 07:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman I I was going
 
07:15:18.410 --> 07:15:18.420 align:start position:0%
to make this statement but I'll just do
 
07:15:21.110 --> 07:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
it for your concurrence uh the the
 
07:15:24.650 --> 07:15:24.660 align:start position:0%
figure 27 billion has been
 
07:15:26.628 --> 07:15:26.638 align:start position:0%
swept around here tonight that's not
 
07:15:28.430 --> 07:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
coming all to New Hampshire right no
 
07:15:31.070 --> 07:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
that it is 27 billion dollars made in
 
07:15:31.080 --> 07:15:32.570 align:start position:0%
that it is 27 billion dollars made in
appropriation

07:15:32.570 --> 07:15:32.580 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
07:15:35.810 --> 07:15:35.820 align:start position:0%
across the board not not 27 billion
 
07:15:37.368 --> 07:15:37.378 align:start position:0%
explicitly coming to the state of New
 
07:15:39.770 --> 07:15:39.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire no I think I'd be a little bit
 
07:15:43.310 --> 07:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
more panicked if that was the case
 
07:15:44.868 --> 07:15:44.878 align:start position:0%
that would engender a lot of
 
07:15:47.448 --> 07:15:47.458 align:start position:0%
administrative yeah and I'm sorry let me
 
07:15:50.030 --> 07:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
clarify a panic just a lot of stress I
 
07:15:52.730 --> 07:15:52.740 align:start position:0%
would say uh managing 27 million I'm
 
07:15:55.430 --> 07:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
sorry uh but I will acknowledge that um
 
07:15:58.788 --> 07:15:58.798 align:start position:0%
uh uh again um I know our division
 
07:16:01.548 --> 07:16:01.558 align:start position:0%
director also did uh send an email to
 
07:16:02.810 --> 07:16:02.820 align:start position:0%
um the product sponsor representative
 
07:16:04.730 --> 07:16:04.740 align:start position:0%
McWilliams as well
 
07:16:06.770 --> 07:16:06.780 align:start position:0%
um I'm only just now reviewing that
 
07:16:08.208 --> 07:16:08.218 align:start position:0%
email here now but I'm sure
 
07:16:09.650 --> 07:16:09.660 align:start position:0%
representative you might be able to
 
07:16:11.208 --> 07:16:11.218 align:start position:0%
speak more to that
 
07:16:11.218 --> 07:16:11.868 align:start position:0%
speak more to that
um

07:16:11.868 --> 07:16:11.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:16:13.548 --> 07:16:13.558 align:start position:0%
in detail I don't mean to push it back
 
07:16:17.868 --> 07:16:17.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:19.788 --> 07:16:19.798 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams do you have
 
07:16:22.250 --> 07:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
anything further to my advantages I I
 
07:16:24.110 --> 07:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
must have missed an email I'm sorry
 
07:16:26.990 --> 07:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
about that uh I'm looking for
 
07:16:28.850 --> 07:16:28.860 align:start position:0%
something from Department of energy and
 
07:16:32.208 --> 07:16:32.218 align:start position:0%
I'm not seeing it here if if I might if
 
07:16:34.250 --> 07:16:34.260 align:start position:0%
it helps at all it was sent Tuesday the
 
07:16:37.190 --> 07:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
31st at 2 29 if that helps at all that
 
07:16:46.788 --> 07:16:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:48.590 --> 07:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
well we wait for representative
 
07:16:52.430 --> 07:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
McWilliams to locate uh and review that
 
07:16:55.490 --> 07:16:55.500 align:start position:0%
email I will say that here we go
 
07:16:57.770 --> 07:16:57.780 align:start position:0%
based on
 
07:17:01.730 --> 07:17:01.740 align:start position:0%
past experience in
 
07:17:05.270 --> 07:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
the federal government providing These
 
07:17:07.910 --> 07:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
funds it doesn't seem to me that it
 
07:17:10.910 --> 07:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
would be a danger to
 
07:17:14.150 --> 07:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
postpone any activity on establishing a
 
07:17:17.628 --> 07:17:17.638 align:start position:0%
green bank for a year because it's very
 
07:17:19.730 --> 07:17:19.740 align:start position:0%
likely the federal government won't get
 
07:17:22.010 --> 07:17:22.020 align:start position:0%
around to providing any funds within a
 
07:17:24.590 --> 07:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
year's time anyway as slow as as things
 
07:17:27.530 --> 07:17:27.540 align:start position:0%
work over there so I don't see any risk
 
07:17:27.540 --> 07:17:29.410 align:start position:0%
work over there so I don't see any risk
in

07:17:29.410 --> 07:17:29.420 align:start position:0%
in
 
07:17:33.530 --> 07:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
foregoing this bill this year and if we
 
07:17:35.750 --> 07:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
need it next year we can always bring it
 
07:17:37.010 --> 07:17:37.020 align:start position:0%
back then
 
07:17:39.048 --> 07:17:39.058 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas do you have
 
07:17:41.390 --> 07:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
a question thank you Mr chair um just to
 
07:17:42.948 --> 07:17:42.958 align:start position:0%
comment on what you just said I thought
 
07:17:45.410 --> 07:17:45.420 align:start position:0%
during the testimony we heard that if a
 
07:17:48.410 --> 07:17:48.420 align:start position:0%
vehicle wasn't set up that it could
 
07:17:48.420 --> 07:17:49.690 align:start position:0%
vehicle wasn't set up that it could
possibly

07:17:49.690 --> 07:17:49.700 align:start position:0%
possibly
 
07:17:53.390 --> 07:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
affect our requests
 
07:17:55.430 --> 07:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
for the money
 
07:17:56.990 --> 07:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
so um
 
07:17:58.910 --> 07:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
so I'm thinking wouldn't it be prudent
 
07:18:02.930 --> 07:18:02.940 align:start position:0%
to set this up in anticipation
 
07:18:05.868 --> 07:18:05.878 align:start position:0%
of receiving the money
 
07:18:07.968 --> 07:18:07.978 align:start position:0%
I suspect we'll have plenty of time to
 
07:18:09.410 --> 07:18:09.420 align:start position:0%
do that later by the time they get
 
07:18:11.868 --> 07:18:11.878 align:start position:0%
around to dishing out the money
 
07:18:14.628 --> 07:18:14.638 align:start position:0%
that would be my judgment
 
07:18:16.910 --> 07:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams
 
07:18:20.330 --> 07:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and thank you Mr Roberts
 
07:18:22.788 --> 07:18:22.798 align:start position:0%
um I I did receive
 
07:18:26.090 --> 07:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
it he had several edits that he
 
07:18:29.090 --> 07:18:29.100 align:start position:0%
made to the base Bill and so those edits
 
07:18:31.250 --> 07:18:31.260 align:start position:0%
were integrated into this amendment that
 
07:18:32.890 --> 07:18:32.900 align:start position:0%
I mentioned previously
 
07:18:35.990 --> 07:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
he wanted to be very clear that New
 
07:18:37.548 --> 07:18:37.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of energy needs to
 
07:18:38.990 --> 07:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
stay consistent with Federal funding
 
07:18:41.570 --> 07:18:41.580 align:start position:0%
terms and conditions which his edits are
 
07:18:43.750 --> 07:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
Incorporated and do that
 
07:18:47.090 --> 07:18:47.100 align:start position:0%
as well as making sure that if the
 
07:18:48.468 --> 07:18:48.478 align:start position:0%
federal fund will allow grants the
 
07:18:50.628 --> 07:18:50.638 align:start position:0%
department of energy can make grants so
 
07:18:52.430 --> 07:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
really it's about deferring to the
 
07:18:53.868 --> 07:18:53.878 align:start position:0%
guidance that we're still waiting for
 
07:18:56.330 --> 07:18:56.340 align:start position:0%
but in terms of timeliness I want to
 
07:18:58.250 --> 07:18:58.260 align:start position:0%
stress that we did hear testimony from
 
07:19:01.128 --> 07:19:01.138 align:start position:0%
Mr Evans Brown in regards to timing of
 
07:19:02.930 --> 07:19:02.940 align:start position:0%
the grant funding from the federal
 
07:19:07.910 --> 07:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
government specific to this bucket Our
 
07:19:10.548 --> 07:19:10.558 align:start position:0%
concern and my my very strong concern
 
07:19:13.730 --> 07:19:13.740 align:start position:0%
here is that if we itl this bill we will
 
07:19:15.170 --> 07:19:15.180 align:start position:0%
not be able to bring it back until
 
07:19:19.850 --> 07:19:19.860 align:start position:0%
probably January of 2024 and so if the
 
07:19:22.190 --> 07:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
funds are available in September of 2023
 
07:19:24.468 --> 07:19:24.478 align:start position:0%
we may be missing a first window we
 
07:19:26.628 --> 07:19:26.638 align:start position:0%
don't know that but it puts us in in a
 
07:19:28.128 --> 07:19:28.138 align:start position:0%
difficult position where we as a
 
07:19:30.350 --> 07:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
legislature operate seasonally whereas
 
07:19:32.390 --> 07:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
the federal government has these rolling
 
07:19:33.948 --> 07:19:33.958 align:start position:0%
deadlines that tend to get bumped and
 
07:19:35.628 --> 07:19:35.638 align:start position:0%
moved but also the deadline is the
 
07:19:37.548 --> 07:19:37.558 align:start position:0%
deadline is the deadline so we can't try
 
07:19:39.230 --> 07:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
to do something special for a deadline
 
07:19:40.910 --> 07:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
because we're only really operating
 
07:19:44.270 --> 07:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
January to June as a legislature so from
 
07:19:47.628 --> 07:19:47.638 align:start position:0%
a prudent perspective to safeguard our
 
07:19:49.610 --> 07:19:49.620 align:start position:0%
our taxpayers dollars that we would like
 
07:19:50.990 --> 07:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
to get back to New Hampshire since
 
07:19:52.430 --> 07:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
they've already been paid and they could
 
07:19:55.250 --> 07:19:55.260 align:start position:0%
come back through the federal IRA
 
07:19:57.530 --> 07:19:57.540 align:start position:0%
I think it makes sense for us to try to
 
07:19:59.690 --> 07:19:59.700 align:start position:0%
hang on to this bill and not just kill
 
07:20:01.850 --> 07:20:01.860 align:start position:0%
it quite yet because something could
 
07:20:03.948 --> 07:20:03.958 align:start position:0%
happen and it would be nice to have
 
07:20:05.990 --> 07:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
something for us to put the money in if
 
07:20:07.968 --> 07:20:07.978 align:start position:0%
that happens and if we do receive
 
07:20:10.310 --> 07:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
guidance in the next couple of months we
 
07:20:11.930 --> 07:20:11.940 align:start position:0%
would be ready to receive some money
 
07:20:15.490 --> 07:20:15.500 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:18.468 --> 07:20:18.478 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi has a comment
 
07:20:21.350 --> 07:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that the doe New
 
07:20:23.690 --> 07:20:23.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire doe could accept these funds
 
07:20:26.410 --> 07:20:26.420 align:start position:0%
and there is already existing financial
 
07:20:29.628 --> 07:20:29.638 align:start position:0%
institution within New Hampshire that
 
07:20:33.350 --> 07:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
administers funds that come from uh the
 
07:20:35.570 --> 07:20:35.580 align:start position:0%
federal government that could be used as
 
07:20:38.208 --> 07:20:38.218 align:start position:0%
a vehicle to administer them so
 
07:20:40.310 --> 07:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
functionally we're set up or we're not
 
07:20:42.288 --> 07:20:42.298 align:start position:0%
going to lose anything we don't need to
 
07:20:46.788 --> 07:20:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:49.548 --> 07:20:49.558 align:start position:0%
additional comments representative
 
07:20:49.558 --> 07:20:50.628 align:start position:0%
additional comments representative
Thomas

07:20:50.628 --> 07:20:50.638 align:start position:0%
Thomas
 
07:20:52.628 --> 07:20:52.638 align:start position:0%
Doug Thomas Doug Thomas
 
07:20:55.610 --> 07:20:55.620 align:start position:0%
yeah just to add on to uh representative
 
07:20:58.670 --> 07:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
uh Bernardi's comment I believe I also
 
07:21:02.030 --> 07:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
heard in testimony that although more
 
07:21:05.208 --> 07:21:05.218 align:start position:0%
convenient with green banks that there
 
07:21:07.670 --> 07:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
were other uh financial institutions
 
07:21:10.850 --> 07:21:10.860 align:start position:0%
that could handle some of these funds as
 
07:21:13.730 --> 07:21:13.740 align:start position:0%
well so we have a couple of options uh
 
07:21:15.410 --> 07:21:15.420 align:start position:0%
right now if should there be an
 
07:21:17.330 --> 07:21:17.340 align:start position:0%
emergency where we have to accept funds
 
07:21:18.770 --> 07:21:18.780 align:start position:0%
right away there are some options here
 
07:21:20.750 --> 07:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
as well
 
07:21:20.760 --> 07:21:22.930 align:start position:0%
as well
foreign

07:21:22.930 --> 07:21:22.940 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
07:21:25.368 --> 07:21:25.378 align:start position:0%
representative partial
 
07:21:27.530 --> 07:21:27.540 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and I would like to ask
 
07:21:30.110 --> 07:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
a question of Mr Roberts do you believe
 
07:21:32.270 --> 07:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
the uh Department of energy is indeed
 
07:21:35.150 --> 07:21:35.160 align:start position:0%
ready to receive these funds and can you
 
07:21:36.770 --> 07:21:36.780 align:start position:0%
name some of the organizations that are
 
07:21:39.288 --> 07:21:39.298 align:start position:0%
prepared to disburse These funds sure uh
 
07:21:41.510 --> 07:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the question so
 
07:21:42.948 --> 07:21:42.958 align:start position:0%
um backing up just a little bit
 
07:21:44.510 --> 07:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
obviously it depends on the various
 
07:21:47.270 --> 07:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
program guidance but um with for example
 
07:21:48.708 --> 07:21:48.718 align:start position:0%
stuff coming out of the infrastructure
 
07:21:50.930 --> 07:21:50.940 align:start position:0%
Bill there is no need for a state stat
 
07:21:53.090 --> 07:21:53.100 align:start position:0%
for state legislators to enact a program
 
07:21:55.910 --> 07:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
to receive those funds so for example
 
07:21:57.910 --> 07:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
like during our presentation
 
07:21:59.990 --> 07:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
earlier when I went over some of the
 
07:22:01.850 --> 07:22:01.860 align:start position:0%
federal funding pots those are funds
 
07:22:03.530 --> 07:22:03.540 align:start position:0%
that we can manage ourselves at least
 
07:22:04.910 --> 07:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
with the current guidance that's
 
07:22:08.208 --> 07:22:08.218 align:start position:0%
available regarding this funding
 
07:22:11.170 --> 07:22:11.180 align:start position:0%
opportunity again it would depend on the
 
07:22:14.090 --> 07:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
type of guidance that's given out if the
 
07:22:16.190 --> 07:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
thought is to
 
07:22:18.288 --> 07:22:18.298 align:start position:0%
um for the Department to issue loans and
 
07:22:20.150 --> 07:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
to leverage private capital and that
 
07:22:22.670 --> 07:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
type of thing that's not something that
 
07:22:24.590 --> 07:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
we can do with current resources that we
 
07:22:26.690 --> 07:22:26.700 align:start position:0%
have we do not administer or any loan
 
07:22:28.670 --> 07:22:28.680 align:start position:0%
programs on our own we usually work with
 
07:22:31.128 --> 07:22:31.138 align:start position:0%
other third parties I think I'd be
 
07:22:32.990 --> 07:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
reluctant at this time to identify
 
07:22:34.910 --> 07:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
specific parties that we would work with
 
07:22:36.288 --> 07:22:36.298 align:start position:0%
on a
 
07:22:38.090 --> 07:22:38.100 align:start position:0%
on a funding pot that we don't know
 
07:22:41.990 --> 07:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
quite a lot of clarity on but if the if
 
07:22:44.448 --> 07:22:44.458 align:start position:0%
the responsibility was to take these
 
07:22:45.530 --> 07:22:45.540 align:start position:0%
dollars and set up some type of
 
07:22:47.510 --> 07:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
revolving Loan Fund or to leverage
 
07:22:50.448 --> 07:22:50.458 align:start position:0%
private capital I imagine you know
 
07:22:53.448 --> 07:22:53.458 align:start position:0%
organizations like the BFA or the cdfa
 
07:22:55.730 --> 07:22:55.740 align:start position:0%
come to mind but I'm not
 
07:22:57.350 --> 07:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
I'm not putting them on the wall or
 
07:22:59.890 --> 07:22:59.900 align:start position:0%
anything like that
 
07:23:02.810 --> 07:23:02.820 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you
 
07:23:05.090 --> 07:23:05.100 align:start position:0%
um I believe there's something like 28
 
07:23:07.968 --> 07:23:07.978 align:start position:0%
States already have been correct me if
 
07:23:11.150 --> 07:23:11.160 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong that have instituted uh Green
 
07:23:14.090 --> 07:23:14.100 align:start position:0%
Banks revolving loan funds and many of
 
07:23:16.788 --> 07:23:16.798 align:start position:0%
them are Republican states do you could
 
07:23:18.650 --> 07:23:18.660 align:start position:0%
you can you tell me about that or are
 
07:23:19.850 --> 07:23:19.860 align:start position:0%
you aware of any of this I could not
 
07:23:22.310 --> 07:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
comment on that right here and now um I
 
07:23:24.170 --> 07:23:24.180 align:start position:0%
I will just acknowledge that I believe
 
07:23:26.150 --> 07:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
some states do have green Banks I
 
07:23:27.468 --> 07:23:27.478 align:start position:0%
couldn't tell you how they function or
 
07:23:29.750 --> 07:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
in what states they operate in neither
 
07:23:31.730 --> 07:23:31.740 align:start position:0%
could I yeah that's fine I appreciate
 
07:23:34.730 --> 07:23:34.740 align:start position:0%
the ask though foreign representative
 
07:23:38.868 --> 07:23:38.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:40.730 --> 07:23:40.740 align:start position:0%
to read something into the record in
 
07:23:44.510 --> 07:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:47.868 --> 07:23:47.878 align:start position:0%
how the concern here is really what do
 
07:23:50.150 --> 07:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
we do with the funds that are coming
 
07:23:54.110 --> 07:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
from the IRA and so if we enact a green
 
07:23:54.120 --> 07:23:55.128 align:start position:0%
from the IRA and so if we enact a green
Bank

07:23:55.128 --> 07:23:55.138 align:start position:0%
Bank
 
07:23:57.948 --> 07:23:57.958 align:start position:0%
then we are applying with our Green Bank
 
07:24:00.530 --> 07:24:00.540 align:start position:0%
to receive the maximum number of funds
 
07:24:03.170 --> 07:24:03.180 align:start position:0%
and we are also directing exactly where
 
07:24:05.868 --> 07:24:05.878 align:start position:0%
those funds go through the green bank if
 
07:24:07.910 --> 07:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
we do not do a green bank then Mr
 
07:24:10.070 --> 07:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
Roberts is correct that the department
 
07:24:12.288 --> 07:24:12.298 align:start position:0%
of energy can be one of the participants
 
07:24:13.850 --> 07:24:13.860 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire who goes after the
 
07:24:16.730 --> 07:24:16.740 align:start position:0%
money but there will be others there are
 
07:24:18.410 --> 07:24:18.420 align:start position:0%
non-profits the Community Loan Fund
 
07:24:20.570 --> 07:24:20.580 align:start position:0%
could go after some of the money um the
 
07:24:23.270 --> 07:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
so there are other sort of competitors
 
07:24:25.368 --> 07:24:25.378 align:start position:0%
not that they need to be competitors but
 
07:24:27.468 --> 07:24:27.478 align:start position:0%
the money would go to different pots and
 
07:24:29.150 --> 07:24:29.160 align:start position:0%
it would be administered according to
 
07:24:30.490 --> 07:24:30.500 align:start position:0%
the applicants
 
07:24:33.890 --> 07:24:33.900 align:start position:0%
proposals and so really what we're
 
07:24:35.510 --> 07:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
talking about here is being able to
 
07:24:37.490 --> 07:24:37.500 align:start position:0%
maintain at a state level biggest bang
 
07:24:39.590 --> 07:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
for your buck through a green Bank as
 
07:24:41.448 --> 07:24:41.458 align:start position:0%
opposed to the Department of energy
 
07:24:44.270 --> 07:24:44.280 align:start position:0%
Department of energy being one of many
 
07:24:46.250 --> 07:24:46.260 align:start position:0%
applicants for the same pool of money
 
07:24:48.590 --> 07:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
often times trying to do overlapping
 
07:24:48.600 --> 07:24:49.490 align:start position:0%
often times trying to do overlapping
things

07:24:49.490 --> 07:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
things
 
07:24:51.610 --> 07:24:51.620 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:24:57.110 --> 07:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:59.150 --> 07:24:59.160 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'd ask the clerk to call
 
07:25:01.968 --> 07:25:01.978 align:start position:0%
the role on the question of itl for
 
07:25:07.968 --> 07:25:07.978 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:07.978 --> 07:25:11.570 align:start position:0%
 
yes

07:25:11.570 --> 07:25:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:11.580 --> 07:25:21.770 align:start position:0%
 
yes

07:25:21.770 --> 07:25:21.780 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:21.780 --> 07:25:26.270 align:start position:0%
 
yes

07:25:26.270 --> 07:25:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:26.280 --> 07:25:31.968 align:start position:0%
 
yes

07:25:31.968 --> 07:25:31.978 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:31.978 --> 07:25:34.850 align:start position:0%
 
no

07:25:34.850 --> 07:25:34.860 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:34.860 --> 07:25:39.230 align:start position:0%
 
no

07:25:39.230 --> 07:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:39.240 --> 07:25:47.628 align:start position:0%
 
no

07:25:47.628 --> 07:25:47.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:47.638 --> 07:25:50.448 align:start position:0%
 
no

07:25:50.448 --> 07:25:50.458 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:50.458 --> 07:25:53.110 align:start position:0%
 
no

07:25:53.110 --> 07:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:01.850 --> 07:26:01.860 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:01.860 --> 07:26:06.850 align:start position:0%
 
yes

07:26:06.850 --> 07:26:06.860 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:09.708 --> 07:26:09.718 align:start position:0%
the vote of 10 to 10 means that the
 
07:26:14.030 --> 07:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
motion fails so if itl is uh off the
 
07:26:16.670 --> 07:26:16.680 align:start position:0%
table I'll now recognize representative
 
07:26:18.708 --> 07:26:18.718 align:start position:0%
McWilliams for a motion
 
07:26:20.868 --> 07:26:20.878 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chair I'd like to move that we
 
07:26:20.878 --> 07:26:22.090 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chair I'd like to move that we
adopt

07:26:22.090 --> 07:26:22.100 align:start position:0%
adopt
 
07:26:25.430 --> 07:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment 0309h which I will pass out
 
07:26:27.650 --> 07:26:27.660 align:start position:0%
which is an amendment to House Bill 630
 
07:26:32.868 --> 07:26:32.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:36.410 --> 07:26:36.420 align:start position:0%
okay so the motion is ought to pass and
 
07:26:40.628 --> 07:26:40.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:45.350 --> 07:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:46.910 --> 07:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
HSN house
 
07:26:48.650 --> 07:26:48.660 align:start position:0%
is there a second for the motion
 
07:26:50.750 --> 07:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
representative Munn seconds the motion
 
07:26:50.760 --> 07:26:51.650 align:start position:0%
representative Munn seconds the motion
so

07:26:51.650 --> 07:26:51.660 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:26:54.410 --> 07:26:54.420 align:start position:0%
we have a motion about to pass
 
07:26:56.410 --> 07:26:56.420 align:start position:0%
with an amendment
 
07:26:59.990 --> 07:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
0309 H is there any discussion
 
07:27:02.628 --> 07:27:02.638 align:start position:0%
I'd like to speak to my motion
 
07:27:05.570 --> 07:27:05.580 align:start position:0%
representative Munn seconded the motion
 
07:27:08.270 --> 07:27:08.280 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams is recognized
 
07:27:10.548 --> 07:27:10.558 align:start position:0%
to speak to her motion thank you very
 
07:27:11.990 --> 07:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
much chair Bose
 
07:27:15.048 --> 07:27:15.058 align:start position:0%
um as we discussed with the underlying
 
07:27:17.570 --> 07:27:17.580 align:start position:0%
Bill discussion there were a couple of
 
07:27:21.230 --> 07:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
changes that we as a committee and of
 
07:27:22.548 --> 07:27:22.558 align:start position:0%
course the department of energy had
 
07:27:24.230 --> 07:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
asked if we were to move forward with
 
07:27:25.868 --> 07:27:25.878 align:start position:0%
doing a green Bank
 
07:27:28.910 --> 07:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
the first is that every reference to
 
07:27:30.830 --> 07:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
revolving clean energy fund has been
 
07:27:33.590 --> 07:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
replaced with revolving Green Bank to
 
07:27:35.390 --> 07:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
make it very clear that this is to match
 
07:27:39.650 --> 07:27:39.660 align:start position:0%
the requirements of the IRA in addition
 
07:27:43.250 --> 07:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
uh there were some suggestions and I
 
07:27:45.368 --> 07:27:45.378 align:start position:0%
will now read them out very specifically
 
07:27:47.990 --> 07:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
from the Tuesday email from Mr Elliott
 
07:27:50.570 --> 07:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
at the department of energy he was
 
07:27:51.948 --> 07:27:51.958 align:start position:0%
concerned about making sure that we
 
07:27:53.390 --> 07:27:53.400 align:start position:0%
followed the requirements of the federal
 
07:27:55.430 --> 07:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
program in order to receive the funding
 
07:27:58.430 --> 07:27:58.440 align:start position:0%
and not be inconsistent with what was
 
07:28:00.410 --> 07:28:00.420 align:start position:0%
what was being requested versus what
 
07:28:02.570 --> 07:28:02.580 align:start position:0%
we're capable of doing so I'm just
 
07:28:04.250 --> 07:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
pulling up the email again my apologies
 
07:28:07.850 --> 07:28:07.860 align:start position:0%
also representative Harrington and I uh
 
07:28:09.650 --> 07:28:09.660 align:start position:0%
worked out I'm going to find the exact
 
07:28:11.090 --> 07:28:11.100 align:start position:0%
reference here
 
07:28:12.708 --> 07:28:12.718 align:start position:0%
we worked out that we wanted to make
 
07:28:15.110 --> 07:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
sure that we could use the fund money
 
07:28:17.090 --> 07:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
from the federal government in order to
 
07:28:18.468 --> 07:28:18.478 align:start position:0%
pay for
 
07:28:18.478 --> 07:28:19.070 align:start position:0%
pay for
um

07:28:19.070 --> 07:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:28:21.890 --> 07:28:21.900 align:start position:0%
the salary of someone who may need to be
 
07:28:24.110 --> 07:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
hired from Des to do Administration for
 
07:28:26.990 --> 07:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
the fund and I would say that we heard
 
07:28:29.628 --> 07:28:29.638 align:start position:0%
testimony that the current amount of
 
07:28:31.730 --> 07:28:31.740 align:start position:0%
federal funds that we're looking at for
 
07:28:33.530 --> 07:28:33.540 align:start position:0%
many of these program items is somewhere
 
07:28:35.810 --> 07:28:35.820 align:start position:0%
between 80 and 90 thousand dollars
 
07:28:38.690 --> 07:28:38.700 align:start position:0%
assuming not every state applies for the
 
07:28:40.610 --> 07:28:40.620 align:start position:0%
funds we would expect more I'm sorry I
 
07:28:42.770 --> 07:28:42.780 align:start position:0%
said 80 90 000 and I made 80 to 90
 
07:28:44.810 --> 07:28:44.820 align:start position:0%
million so how do we expect that the
 
07:28:47.208 --> 07:28:47.218 align:start position:0%
total number is somewhere north of 80 or
 
07:28:49.310 --> 07:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
90 million but we really don't know
 
07:28:50.930 --> 07:28:50.940 align:start position:0%
exactly how much because it depends on
 
07:28:53.448 --> 07:28:53.458 align:start position:0%
how many other states apply but that is
 
07:28:55.250 --> 07:28:55.260 align:start position:0%
not chump change that's significant
 
07:28:57.288 --> 07:28:57.298 align:start position:0%
money that we want to make sure that if
 
07:28:58.670 --> 07:28:58.680 align:start position:0%
you come back to the state from our
 
07:28:58.680 --> 07:29:00.288 align:start position:0%
you come back to the state from our
taxpayers

07:29:00.288 --> 07:29:00.298 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
07:29:00.298 --> 07:29:01.968 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
um

07:29:01.968 --> 07:29:01.978 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:29:03.350 --> 07:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
so let me see if I can find the
 
07:29:05.330 --> 07:29:05.340 align:start position:0%
provision that representative Harrington
 
07:29:11.090 --> 07:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:14.628 --> 07:29:14.638 align:start position:0%
page three I believe page four thank you
 
07:29:20.510 --> 07:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:24.110 --> 07:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
say that again all right 32 and 33 on
 
07:29:25.548 --> 07:29:25.558 align:start position:0%
page four
 
07:29:27.650 --> 07:29:27.660 align:start position:0%
to sustain operations the department may
 
07:29:29.570 --> 07:29:29.580 align:start position:0%
use capitalization funds financing fees
 
07:29:30.948 --> 07:29:30.958 align:start position:0%
interest repaid loans or other types of
 
07:29:33.230 --> 07:29:33.240 align:start position:0%
funding the department May immediately
 
07:29:35.330 --> 07:29:35.340 align:start position:0%
use federal funds as permitted upon
 
07:29:36.890 --> 07:29:36.900 align:start position:0%
receipt to pay for administrative costs
 
07:29:38.330 --> 07:29:38.340 align:start position:0%
related to administering the green Bank
 
07:29:40.548 --> 07:29:40.558 align:start position:0%
fund and we did hear testimony that
 
07:29:42.708 --> 07:29:42.718 align:start position:0%
generally these federal funds come with
 
07:29:44.690 --> 07:29:44.700 align:start position:0%
the provision that you can pay for
 
07:29:46.430 --> 07:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
administrative costs for a certain
 
07:29:48.830 --> 07:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
percentage of the total funds received
 
07:29:50.690 --> 07:29:50.700 align:start position:0%
so that is an expectation and we're
 
07:29:52.968 --> 07:29:52.978 align:start position:0%
enabling that so that department of
 
07:29:54.850 --> 07:29:54.860 align:start position:0%
energy can do that
 
07:29:58.310 --> 07:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
let me just jump back to the email
 
07:30:00.048 --> 07:30:00.058 align:start position:0%
regarding requests from the Department
 
07:30:02.990 --> 07:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
of energy very specific to being able to
 
07:30:06.288 --> 07:30:06.298 align:start position:0%
use this money in keeping with the the
 
07:30:08.390 --> 07:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
federal guidelines rather than jumping
 
07:30:11.030 --> 07:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
all around and doing anything we want
 
07:30:13.368 --> 07:30:13.378 align:start position:0%
and then getting in trouble later on
 
07:30:17.628 --> 07:30:17.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:27.650 --> 07:30:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:29.448 --> 07:30:29.458 align:start position:0%
page two
 
07:30:32.810 --> 07:30:32.820 align:start position:0%
um we're looking at
 
07:30:43.548 --> 07:30:43.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:44.990 --> 07:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
well it looks like we got a spacing
 
07:30:46.070 --> 07:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
issue here
 
07:30:48.590 --> 07:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
we added and consistent with the terms
 
07:30:50.270 --> 07:30:50.280 align:start position:0%
and conditions of any federal funding
 
07:30:51.650 --> 07:30:51.660 align:start position:0%
I'm just looking for where that actually
 
07:30:53.390 --> 07:30:53.400 align:start position:0%
landed it looks like there was a spacing
 
07:30:53.400 --> 07:30:54.948 align:start position:0%
landed it looks like there was a spacing
issue

07:30:54.948 --> 07:30:54.958 align:start position:0%
issue
 
07:30:58.190 --> 07:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
uh that's just a provision to stay in in
 
07:30:59.690 --> 07:30:59.700 align:start position:0%
keeping with
 
07:31:01.730 --> 07:31:01.740 align:start position:0%
um If the Fed says we can do it we will
 
07:31:05.590 --> 07:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:09.170 --> 07:31:09.180 align:start position:0%
line 30 page two there we go line 30
 
07:31:14.270 --> 07:31:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:16.128 --> 07:31:16.138 align:start position:0%
consistent with the terms and conditions
 
07:31:18.468 --> 07:31:18.478 align:start position:0%
of any federal funding
 
07:31:18.478 --> 07:31:19.490 align:start position:0%
of any federal funding
um

07:31:19.490 --> 07:31:19.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:31:22.850 --> 07:31:22.860 align:start position:0%
next edit was on the previous page four
 
07:31:24.590 --> 07:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
line 11.
 
07:31:26.930 --> 07:31:26.940 align:start position:0%
we just added allowing us to receive
 
07:31:30.410 --> 07:31:30.420 align:start position:0%
grants and and there was a renumbering
 
07:31:33.230 --> 07:31:33.240 align:start position:0%
edit so if if grants are allowed it
 
07:31:35.150 --> 07:31:35.160 align:start position:0%
means that the federal funds will allow
 
07:31:37.490 --> 07:31:37.500 align:start position:0%
grants so the state can make grants I'm
 
07:31:38.510 --> 07:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
just looking for where that actually
 
07:31:38.520 --> 07:31:39.590 align:start position:0%
just looking for where that actually
landed

07:31:39.590 --> 07:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
landed
 
07:31:41.570 --> 07:31:41.580 align:start position:0%
probably slightly further down because
 
07:31:51.350 --> 07:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:54.708 --> 07:31:54.718 align:start position:0%
all right line 17 grants added to
 
07:31:57.110 --> 07:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
numbers one two three four number five
 
07:31:59.330 --> 07:31:59.340 align:start position:0%
is allowing grants in the form of Grants
 
07:32:00.770 --> 07:32:00.780 align:start position:0%
it looks like we missed a space but
 
07:32:02.990 --> 07:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
that's fine
 
07:32:06.548 --> 07:32:06.558 align:start position:0%
um next one uh
 
07:32:10.910 --> 07:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
page four lines 25 to 26 previously
 
07:32:13.490 --> 07:32:13.500 align:start position:0%
we added in the language to sustain
 
07:32:15.110 --> 07:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
operations which I already addressed
 
07:32:17.270 --> 07:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
this was specific for
 
07:32:17.280 --> 07:32:19.670 align:start position:0%
this was specific for
um allowing

07:32:19.670 --> 07:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
um allowing
 
07:32:21.590 --> 07:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
capitalization funds financing fees
 
07:32:23.150 --> 07:32:23.160 align:start position:0%
interest repaid loans and other types of
 
07:32:23.160 --> 07:32:24.048 align:start position:0%
interest repaid loans and other types of
funding

07:32:24.048 --> 07:32:24.058 align:start position:0%
funding
 
07:32:27.048 --> 07:32:27.058 align:start position:0%
so we addressed that one um and then
 
07:32:31.250 --> 07:32:31.260 align:start position:0%
finally page four previously line 30
 
07:32:34.250 --> 07:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
we added new language section
 
07:32:38.448 --> 07:32:38.458 align:start position:0%
e and this is now on page five line five
 
07:32:40.490 --> 07:32:40.500 align:start position:0%
new section e the department may enter
 
07:32:42.468 --> 07:32:42.478 align:start position:0%
into contracts with third parties for
 
07:32:44.930 --> 07:32:44.940 align:start position:0%
the management of funds and programs so
 
07:32:46.490 --> 07:32:46.500 align:start position:0%
that will allow the department of energy
 
07:32:48.170 --> 07:32:48.180 align:start position:0%
to work with someone like the Community
 
07:32:51.048 --> 07:32:51.058 align:start position:0%
Loan Fund if they choose to to
 
07:32:53.090 --> 07:32:53.100 align:start position:0%
administer and use their staff who are
 
07:32:54.830 --> 07:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
experts in managing this type of
 
07:32:56.990 --> 07:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
revolving funding rather than Department
 
07:32:59.150 --> 07:32:59.160 align:start position:0%
of energy which tends to be a little bit
 
07:33:00.530 --> 07:33:00.540 align:start position:0%
more policy a little less money
 
07:33:04.128 --> 07:33:04.138 align:start position:0%
management so that's a review of the
 
07:33:04.138 --> 07:33:06.170 align:start position:0%
management so that's a review of the
amendment

07:33:06.170 --> 07:33:06.180 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
07:33:06.180 --> 07:33:08.288 align:start position:0%
amendment
foreign

07:33:08.288 --> 07:33:08.298 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
07:33:11.690 --> 07:33:11.700 align:start position:0%
comments on the amendment on the bill
 
07:33:14.990 --> 07:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
representative closure
 
07:33:17.930 --> 07:33:17.940 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chair
 
07:33:21.948 --> 07:33:21.958 align:start position:0%
probably to representative McWilliams on
 
07:33:26.628 --> 07:33:26.638 align:start position:0%
your on the amendment page three
 
07:33:29.868 --> 07:33:29.878 align:start position:0%
line 14
 
07:33:33.410 --> 07:33:33.420 align:start position:0%
to 15.
 
07:33:36.830 --> 07:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm looking for an explanation on
 
07:33:39.650 --> 07:33:39.660 align:start position:0%
financing Pro Finance program designed
 
07:33:42.708 --> 07:33:42.718 align:start position:0%
to drive private Capital into Market
 
07:33:47.090 --> 07:33:47.100 align:start position:0%
gaps that and may I explain
 
07:33:49.610 --> 07:33:49.620 align:start position:0%
this is a one-time funding
 
07:33:53.390 --> 07:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
of the money that we get
 
07:33:56.048 --> 07:33:56.058 align:start position:0%
and it's going to
 
07:33:59.628 --> 07:33:59.638 align:start position:0%
Drive private Capital into a place where
 
07:34:01.490 --> 07:34:01.500 align:start position:0%
they're not normally would been
 
07:34:04.070 --> 07:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
otherwise it wouldn't be a gap
 
07:34:06.530 --> 07:34:06.540 align:start position:0%
I have a concern of after the funding's
 
07:34:09.410 --> 07:34:09.420 align:start position:0%
over we're picking and choosing
 
07:34:09.420 --> 07:34:10.190 align:start position:0%
over we're picking and choosing
um

07:34:10.190 --> 07:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:34:11.990 --> 07:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
winners because
 
07:34:15.468 --> 07:34:15.478 align:start position:0%
I'm visualizing a gap where Private
 
07:34:18.650 --> 07:34:18.660 align:start position:0%
Industry Capital does not want to go
 
07:34:21.468 --> 07:34:21.478 align:start position:0%
what happens after the fact no more
 
07:34:24.650 --> 07:34:24.660 align:start position:0%
funding to maintain that thank you
 
07:34:26.510 --> 07:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
is that a question or is that just a
 
07:34:26.520 --> 07:34:27.968 align:start position:0%
is that a question or is that just a
comment

07:34:27.968 --> 07:34:27.978 align:start position:0%
comment
 
07:34:30.468 --> 07:34:30.478 align:start position:0%
it was uh
 
07:34:33.530 --> 07:34:33.540 align:start position:0%
a request for an explanation from the
 
07:34:33.540 --> 07:34:34.490 align:start position:0%
a request for an explanation from the
meaning

07:34:34.490 --> 07:34:34.500 align:start position:0%
meaning
 
07:34:37.490 --> 07:34:37.500 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams can you
 
07:34:39.350 --> 07:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
answer the question
 
07:34:42.770 --> 07:34:42.780 align:start position:0%
sure that's a great question thank you
 
07:34:44.448 --> 07:34:44.458 align:start position:0%
um when we when we heard testimony on
 
07:34:46.010 --> 07:34:46.020 align:start position:0%
this one of the things that I brought up
 
07:34:48.708 --> 07:34:48.718 align:start position:0%
as a current market Gap is um electric
 
07:34:51.170 --> 07:34:51.180 align:start position:0%
vehicle charging stations we know right
 
07:34:53.868 --> 07:34:53.878 align:start position:0%
now we're just not seeing a lot of
 
07:34:55.250 --> 07:34:55.260 align:start position:0%
supporters stepping up with private
 
07:34:57.170 --> 07:34:57.180 align:start position:0%
capital in this moment in New Hampshire
 
07:34:59.930 --> 07:34:59.940 align:start position:0%
for EV charging stations so that would
 
07:35:03.288 --> 07:35:03.298 align:start position:0%
be the low-hanging fruit immediately I
 
07:35:04.910 --> 07:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
just want to reiterate that the
 
07:35:07.010 --> 07:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
intention of this fund is to issue loans
 
07:35:09.288 --> 07:35:09.298 align:start position:0%
and to collect some interest on those
 
07:35:12.770 --> 07:35:12.780 align:start position:0%
loans so the idea is very similar to our
 
07:35:15.468 --> 07:35:15.478 align:start position:0%
ongoing water issues fund that the state
 
07:35:18.530 --> 07:35:18.540 align:start position:0%
has to address problems with cities and
 
07:35:20.330 --> 07:35:20.340 align:start position:0%
towns that have contaminated water or
 
07:35:22.788 --> 07:35:22.798 align:start position:0%
folks who need to get a new well they
 
07:35:24.288 --> 07:35:24.298 align:start position:0%
take out a loan and they pay it back to
 
07:35:26.208 --> 07:35:26.218 align:start position:0%
the states with interest so that the
 
07:35:28.490 --> 07:35:28.500 align:start position:0%
fund continues for water that's the same
 
07:35:30.968 --> 07:35:30.978 align:start position:0%
intention here only with
 
07:35:34.310 --> 07:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
green type projects and so the fund
 
07:35:36.048 --> 07:35:36.058 align:start position:0%
continues because the loans get repaid
 
07:35:38.390 --> 07:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
with interest and certainly there's the
 
07:35:41.208 --> 07:35:41.218 align:start position:0%
opportunity for other vehicles besides
 
07:35:43.968 --> 07:35:43.978 align:start position:0%
the FED to fund the loan the entire
 
07:35:46.850 --> 07:35:46.860 align:start position:0%
green bank if they choose to it's an
 
07:35:48.890 --> 07:35:48.900 align:start position:0%
open-ended if they wanted to they could
 
07:35:51.530 --> 07:35:51.540 align:start position:0%
direct an investment into it it's hard
 
07:35:53.030 --> 07:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
to say how it will actually play out
 
07:35:55.610 --> 07:35:55.620 align:start position:0%
this is really meant to be enabling and
 
07:35:58.128 --> 07:35:58.138 align:start position:0%
so I want to call I want to draw your
 
07:35:59.510 --> 07:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
attention to
 
07:36:01.548 --> 07:36:01.558 align:start position:0%
um the provisions where we talked about
 
07:36:01.558 --> 07:36:03.708 align:start position:0%
um the provisions where we talked about
priorities

07:36:03.708 --> 07:36:03.718 align:start position:0%
priorities
 
07:36:05.208 --> 07:36:05.218 align:start position:0%
um because I think that's important for
 
07:36:06.890 --> 07:36:06.900 align:start position:0%
the long term for the way that the fund
 
07:36:09.530 --> 07:36:09.540 align:start position:0%
is actually managed
 
07:36:09.540 --> 07:36:12.468 align:start position:0%
is actually managed
um

07:36:12.468 --> 07:36:12.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:18.590 --> 07:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
so we're on page four line 23 Romans 7.
 
07:36:22.430 --> 07:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
and so the number one provision was to
 
07:36:24.948 --> 07:36:24.958 align:start position:0%
mitigate greenhouse gas emissions that's
 
07:36:28.670 --> 07:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
what if Des is I'm sorry if Department
 
07:36:31.430 --> 07:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
of energy if doe is administering the
 
07:36:33.590 --> 07:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
fund their goal is to mitigate
 
07:36:36.590 --> 07:36:36.600 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas emissions and maximize
 
07:36:38.510 --> 07:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the
 
07:36:40.010 --> 07:36:40.020 align:start position:0%
state to the greatest extent possible
 
07:36:42.350 --> 07:36:42.360 align:start position:0%
for every dollar deployed by the fund
 
07:36:44.510 --> 07:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
and then the second piece was ensuring
 
07:36:46.788 --> 07:36:46.798 align:start position:0%
40 of investment activity from the fund
 
07:36:48.468 --> 07:36:48.478 align:start position:0%
is directed to serve vulnerable
 
07:36:50.448 --> 07:36:50.458 align:start position:0%
communities so those are really the
 
07:36:52.128 --> 07:36:52.138 align:start position:0%
priorities of the fun and Fund in
 
07:36:52.138 --> 07:36:53.690 align:start position:0%
priorities of the fun and Fund in
perpetuity

07:36:53.690 --> 07:36:53.700 align:start position:0%
perpetuity
 
07:36:55.250 --> 07:36:55.260 align:start position:0%
um although I see I see your point about
 
07:36:57.288 --> 07:36:57.298 align:start position:0%
directing to private capital and that is
 
07:37:00.410 --> 07:37:00.420 align:start position:0%
certainly a listed sort of Mantra of the
 
07:37:00.420 --> 07:37:01.510 align:start position:0%
certainly a listed sort of Mantra of the
entire

07:37:01.510 --> 07:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
entire
 
07:37:05.208 --> 07:37:05.218 align:start position:0%
 
07:37:07.190 --> 07:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
additional comments representative Doug
 
07:37:09.770 --> 07:37:09.780 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr chair
 
07:37:13.430 --> 07:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
um I understand what the amendment and
 
07:37:15.890 --> 07:37:15.900 align:start position:0%
the base bill is trying to do
 
07:37:19.490 --> 07:37:19.500 align:start position:0%
but I'm still uncomfortable and I
 
07:37:21.650 --> 07:37:21.660 align:start position:0%
haven't heard convincing testimony from
 
07:37:25.850 --> 07:37:25.860 align:start position:0%
uh the the previous testifiers as to why
 
07:37:28.368 --> 07:37:28.378 align:start position:0%
we absolutely positively have to have
 
07:37:31.850 --> 07:37:31.860 align:start position:0%
this instrument uh if some monies came
 
07:37:31.860 --> 07:37:32.750 align:start position:0%
this instrument uh if some monies came
here

07:37:32.750 --> 07:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
here
 
07:37:36.650 --> 07:37:36.660 align:start position:0%
um and not being a loan officer or a
 
07:37:40.610 --> 07:37:40.620 align:start position:0%
lawyer I I really don't know
 
07:37:43.190 --> 07:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
um what we're getting into here so I at
 
07:37:45.590 --> 07:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
this time I I couldn't support this
 
07:37:49.788 --> 07:37:49.798 align:start position:0%
amendment uh because we we just don't
 
07:37:52.368 --> 07:37:52.378 align:start position:0%
know enough and as the the gentleman
 
07:37:55.310 --> 07:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
from the UE spoke we still don't know
 
07:37:57.708 --> 07:37:57.718 align:start position:0%
all of the details yet coming from the
 
07:38:00.110 --> 07:38:00.120 align:start position:0%
federal government and it this just
 
07:38:01.788 --> 07:38:01.798 align:start position:0%
might be premature this might be a great
 
07:38:04.070 --> 07:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
document but it just might be premature
 
07:38:06.048 --> 07:38:06.058 align:start position:0%
so I I feel uncomfortable and I don't
 
07:38:08.270 --> 07:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
think I can support that

additional comments representative muns
 
07:38:14.150 --> 07:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
07:38:14.160 --> 07:38:15.410 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

07:38:15.410 --> 07:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:38:17.628 --> 07:38:17.638 align:start position:0%
to representative Doug Thomas's point I
 
07:38:20.930 --> 07:38:20.940 align:start position:0%
mean we we don't know I mean that that's
 
07:38:22.430 --> 07:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
um I don't think there's anybody here
 
07:38:24.708 --> 07:38:24.718 align:start position:0%
that you know on you know believes that
 
07:38:26.448 --> 07:38:26.458 align:start position:0%
we have a clear understanding of exactly
 
07:38:28.010 --> 07:38:28.020 align:start position:0%
how this money is going to come to the
 
07:38:29.570 --> 07:38:29.580 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
07:38:31.730 --> 07:38:31.740 align:start position:0%
you know I guess I look at this the
 
07:38:33.410 --> 07:38:33.420 align:start position:0%
reason for doing this is out of an
 
07:38:36.048 --> 07:38:36.058 align:start position:0%
abundance of caution to make sure that
 
07:38:38.690 --> 07:38:38.700 align:start position:0%
you know if there is the opportunity to
 
07:38:41.750 --> 07:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
get this money that we have
 
07:38:44.150 --> 07:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
um a chance to do so rather than being
 
07:38:45.968 --> 07:38:45.978 align:start position:0%
in a situation where we potentially
 
07:38:49.310 --> 07:38:49.320 align:start position:0%
could could lose out on on funding
 
07:38:51.230 --> 07:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
because we don't have an appropriate
 
07:38:53.448 --> 07:38:53.458 align:start position:0%
vehicle to accept the funding so it's
 
07:38:55.610 --> 07:38:55.620 align:start position:0%
it's you're you're absolutely right that
 
07:38:57.650 --> 07:38:57.660 align:start position:0%
we don't know
 
07:38:58.910 --> 07:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
um and I think we're doing this trying
 
07:39:04.190 --> 07:39:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:06.830 --> 07:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
representative partial you had a comment
 
07:39:08.990 --> 07:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
I did thank you chair
 
07:39:12.288 --> 07:39:12.298 align:start position:0%
um along similar to lines uh I'd like to
 
07:39:15.410 --> 07:39:15.420 align:start position:0%
ask what is the not knowing the federal
 
07:39:17.750 --> 07:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
government's guidelines or knowing
 
07:39:19.250 --> 07:39:19.260 align:start position:0%
Federal government's timetable for
 
07:39:20.930 --> 07:39:20.940 align:start position:0%
releasing funds
 
07:39:24.170 --> 07:39:24.180 align:start position:0%
how would you compare
 
07:39:26.510 --> 07:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
the worst case scenario of enacting
 
07:39:28.910 --> 07:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
enabling this bill now rather than the
 
07:39:31.490 --> 07:39:31.500 align:start position:0%
worst case scenario of waiting a year to
 
07:39:34.788 --> 07:39:34.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:37.190 --> 07:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
is this a question are you asking us I I
 
07:39:40.128 --> 07:39:40.138 align:start position:0%
would like to I would like to hear
 
07:39:43.010 --> 07:39:43.020 align:start position:0%
um the potential if we do wait a year
 
07:39:44.390 --> 07:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
could we potentially be losing out on
 
07:39:46.968 --> 07:39:46.978 align:start position:0%
funds the short answer yes
 
07:39:48.890 --> 07:39:48.900 align:start position:0%
potentially well we're talking about one
 
07:39:51.708 --> 07:39:51.718 align:start position:0%
big bucket with one goal of how we would
 
07:39:53.930 --> 07:39:53.940 align:start position:0%
spend the money rather than a couple of
 
07:39:55.910 --> 07:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
small throw bologna at the wall buckets
 
07:39:58.610 --> 07:39:58.620 align:start position:0%
that may or may not work out and we
 
07:40:01.070 --> 07:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
don't know so I think it would be really
 
07:40:02.868 --> 07:40:02.878 align:start position:0%
easy for finance to make the decision
 
07:40:04.610 --> 07:40:04.620 align:start position:0%
about this because I assume they would
 
07:40:06.890 --> 07:40:06.900 align:start position:0%
be the next committee to review this as
 
07:40:08.990 --> 07:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
the guidance is issued rather than
 
07:40:11.510 --> 07:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
saying let's wait a year and then all of
 
07:40:15.968 --> 07:40:15.978 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:18.170 --> 07:40:18.180 align:start position:0%
representative partial I would react to
 
07:40:19.310 --> 07:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
your question
 
07:40:21.890 --> 07:40:21.900 align:start position:0%
by pointing out that
 
07:40:24.948 --> 07:40:24.958 align:start position:0%
if you wait until the federal guidance
 
07:40:27.590 --> 07:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
is promulgated
 
07:40:29.270 --> 07:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
to the state
 
07:40:31.610 --> 07:40:31.620 align:start position:0%
you can craft programs
 
07:40:34.310 --> 07:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
that conform to that guidance putting a
 
07:40:36.350 --> 07:40:36.360 align:start position:0%
program in place before that guidance
 
07:40:38.270 --> 07:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
comes down
 
07:40:40.850 --> 07:40:40.860 align:start position:0%
might actually put you at risk of
 
07:40:43.548 --> 07:40:43.558 align:start position:0%
missing out on some of the
 
07:40:45.650 --> 07:40:45.660 align:start position:0%
Revenue that's available simply because
 
07:40:48.830 --> 07:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
you haven't created a program that
 
07:40:51.250 --> 07:40:51.260 align:start position:0%
conforms to the guidance
 
07:40:55.070 --> 07:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
this led this amendment
 
07:40:57.288 --> 07:40:57.298 align:start position:0%
while generally better than the original
 
07:40:57.298 --> 07:40:58.730 align:start position:0%
while generally better than the original
bill

07:40:58.730 --> 07:40:58.740 align:start position:0%
bill
 
07:41:02.208 --> 07:41:02.218 align:start position:0%
still does have some
 
07:41:05.030 --> 07:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
inefficiencies and in fact introduced a
 
07:41:06.530 --> 07:41:06.540 align:start position:0%
new inefficiency
 
07:41:09.948 --> 07:41:09.958 align:start position:0%
on page five line five when it
 
07:41:12.590 --> 07:41:12.600 align:start position:0%
added the statement that the department
 
07:41:14.510 --> 07:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
may enter into contracts with third
 
07:41:16.730 --> 07:41:16.740 align:start position:0%
parties for the management of funds and
 
07:41:16.740 --> 07:41:17.810 align:start position:0%
parties for the management of funds and
programs

07:41:17.810 --> 07:41:17.820 align:start position:0%
programs
 
07:41:20.770 --> 07:41:20.780 align:start position:0%
that's just inefficiency I mean
 
07:41:24.048 --> 07:41:24.058 align:start position:0%
that ends up using program funds for
 
07:41:28.010 --> 07:41:28.020 align:start position:0%
administration when they that money
 
07:41:29.930 --> 07:41:29.940 align:start position:0%
might better be used for programs
 
07:41:32.750 --> 07:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
themselves I think it makes sense to
 
07:41:35.150 --> 07:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
wait until you see what the guidance is
 
07:41:36.770 --> 07:41:36.780 align:start position:0%
from the federal government and then
 
07:41:39.590 --> 07:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
design programs that that allow you to
 
07:41:39.600 --> 07:41:41.390 align:start position:0%
design programs that that allow you to
maximize

07:41:41.390 --> 07:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
maximize
 
07:41:43.490 --> 07:41:43.500 align:start position:0%
your return
 
07:41:46.070 --> 07:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
on the on these programs based on that
 
07:41:46.080 --> 07:41:47.208 align:start position:0%
on the on these programs based on that
guidance

07:41:47.208 --> 07:41:47.218 align:start position:0%
guidance
 
07:41:50.270 --> 07:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
so I think it's time to to wait on this
 
07:41:50.280 --> 07:41:51.770 align:start position:0%
so I think it's time to to wait on this
particular

07:41:51.770 --> 07:41:51.780 align:start position:0%
particular
 
07:41:54.830 --> 07:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
type of legislation

any further comments representative
 
07:41:56.520 --> 07:41:58.548 align:start position:0%
any further comments representative
closure

07:41:58.548 --> 07:41:58.558 align:start position:0%
closure
 
07:42:01.510 --> 07:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
and thank you chair um May I address
 
07:42:06.948 --> 07:42:06.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:10.128 --> 07:42:10.138 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead and thank you
 
07:42:10.138 --> 07:42:10.750 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead and thank you
um

07:42:10.750 --> 07:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:42:13.730 --> 07:42:13.740 align:start position:0%
with the other concerns I have I just
 
07:42:16.430 --> 07:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
want noted that representative
 
07:42:19.610 --> 07:42:19.620 align:start position:0%
McWilliams did alleviate my concern for
 
07:42:21.048 --> 07:42:21.058 align:start position:0%
that Gap
 
07:42:23.030 --> 07:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
okay good
 
07:42:25.128 --> 07:42:25.138 align:start position:0%
any further comments representative
 
07:42:25.138 --> 07:42:26.628 align:start position:0%
any further comments representative
McWilliams

07:42:26.628 --> 07:42:26.638 align:start position:0%
McWilliams
 
07:42:28.788 --> 07:42:28.798 align:start position:0%
thank you chervos I I want to say that
 
07:42:30.948 --> 07:42:30.958 align:start position:0%
in principle I absolutely agree with you
 
07:42:33.048 --> 07:42:33.058 align:start position:0%
and if we did not only meet from January
 
07:42:34.730 --> 07:42:34.740 align:start position:0%
through June if we were meeting year
 
07:42:36.770 --> 07:42:36.780 align:start position:0%
round we could absolutely respond to
 
07:42:38.510 --> 07:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
federal guidelines but because we are
 
07:42:40.250 --> 07:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
constrained as a legislature we only
 
07:42:41.810 --> 07:42:41.820 align:start position:0%
have six months
 
07:42:44.750 --> 07:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
we have to do the best we can with
 
07:42:47.030 --> 07:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
foresight and be ready rather than
 
07:42:49.430 --> 07:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
respond to federal guidelines 12 months
 
07:42:51.170 --> 07:42:51.180 align:start position:0%
out of the year and so we're kind of
 
07:42:52.910 --> 07:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
stuck in this pickle but I do understand
 
07:42:54.410 --> 07:42:54.420 align:start position:0%
what you're saying and I think that in
 
07:42:57.110 --> 07:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
principle it makes sense to respond to a
 
07:43:00.650 --> 07:43:00.660 align:start position:0%
federal RFP with exact language we're
 
07:43:02.330 --> 07:43:02.340 align:start position:0%
just not in a position to be able to do
 
07:43:04.250 --> 07:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
that and so I don't want to miss out on
 
07:43:06.288 --> 07:43:06.298 align:start position:0%
the opportunity because we don't meet
 
07:43:08.690 --> 07:43:08.700 align:start position:0%
year-round thank you
 
07:43:11.810 --> 07:43:11.820 align:start position:0%
thank you further comments
 
07:43:14.090 --> 07:43:14.100 align:start position:0%
representative partial
 
07:43:16.670 --> 07:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
yes my understanding of this bill is not
 
07:43:19.070 --> 07:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
that it is actually appealing uh to an
 
07:43:21.650 --> 07:43:21.660 align:start position:0%
RFP but it will enable the department of
 
07:43:24.708 --> 07:43:24.718 align:start position:0%
enable us to do is do as much when we
 
07:43:26.270 --> 07:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
know what the guidelines are as soon as
 
07:43:28.548 --> 07:43:28.558 align:start position:0%
we know what the guidelines are
 
07:43:30.830 --> 07:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
so it's not really so much
 
07:43:33.468 --> 07:43:33.478 align:start position:0%
a program as much as it's enabling tool
 
07:43:35.690 --> 07:43:35.700 align:start position:0%
and the step towards creating a program
 
07:43:39.110 --> 07:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
am I reading this correctly
 
07:43:41.690 --> 07:43:41.700 align:start position:0%
oh thank you
 
07:43:46.190 --> 07:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:49.010 --> 07:43:49.020 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none I would like to ask the
 
07:43:49.020 --> 07:43:50.030 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none I would like to ask the

07:45:03.650 --> 07:45:03.660 align:start position:0%
10 to 10.
 
07:45:06.368 --> 07:45:06.378 align:start position:0%
so the motion to adopt Amendment
 
07:45:12.530 --> 07:45:12.540 align:start position:0%
0309 H fails on a tied vote of 10 10. we
 
07:45:14.448 --> 07:45:14.458 align:start position:0%
can assume that
 
07:45:17.990 --> 07:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
the motion to pass the
 
07:45:20.570 --> 07:45:20.580 align:start position:0%
original legislation unamended would
 
07:45:22.430 --> 07:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
also fail
 
07:45:24.890 --> 07:45:24.900 align:start position:0%
so we have two options here we can take
 
07:45:26.570 --> 07:45:26.580 align:start position:0%
this bill to the house floor without
 
07:45:26.580 --> 07:45:28.368 align:start position:0%
this bill to the house floor without
recommendation

07:45:28.368 --> 07:45:28.378 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
07:45:31.910 --> 07:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
or we could retain the bill
 
07:45:35.628 --> 07:45:35.638 align:start position:0%
is there any appetite for retaining the
 
07:45:35.638 --> 07:45:40.368 align:start position:0%
is there any appetite for retaining the
bill

07:45:40.368 --> 07:45:40.378 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:41.628 --> 07:45:41.638 align:start position:0%
there I'd move to retain the bill
 
07:45:43.670 --> 07:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams I'd move to
 
07:45:47.350 --> 07:45:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:50.990 --> 07:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams moves retain
 
07:45:55.910 --> 07:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:57.590 --> 07:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
it's been moved and seconded
 
07:46:00.830 --> 07:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
representative Corman seconded the
 
07:46:03.410 --> 07:46:03.420 align:start position:0%
the motion so we have a motion on the
 
07:46:06.110 --> 07:46:06.120 align:start position:0%
floor to retain this bill
 
07:46:09.110 --> 07:46:09.120 align:start position:0%
is there any discussion of that motion
 
07:46:11.810 --> 07:46:11.820 align:start position:0%
representative closure
 
07:46:14.690 --> 07:46:14.700 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chair this question may be
 
07:46:15.890 --> 07:46:15.900 align:start position:0%
to the chair
 
07:46:18.968 --> 07:46:18.978 align:start position:0%
if this bill is retained when can we
 
07:46:23.208 --> 07:46:23.218 align:start position:0%
next bring it up to discuss it again
 
07:46:27.590 --> 07:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
it's good we can bring it up this fall
 
07:46:30.468 --> 07:46:30.478 align:start position:0%
and discuss it it there is a deadline
 
07:46:31.910 --> 07:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
that will be published in the calendar
 
07:46:34.690 --> 07:46:34.700 align:start position:0%
it's roughly November
 
07:46:39.110 --> 07:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
for reporting out of retained bills
 
07:46:42.830 --> 07:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
if we reported it out uh at that time it
 
07:46:45.590 --> 07:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
would go to the house floor in January
 
07:46:47.570 --> 07:46:47.580 align:start position:0%
and then would proceed through the
 
07:46:50.690 --> 07:46:50.700 align:start position:0%
process from from that point forward so
 
07:46:52.430 --> 07:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
retaining the bill really probably
 
07:46:55.070 --> 07:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't gain us much because we could
 
07:46:58.070 --> 07:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
bring fresh legislation forward in the
 
07:46:58.080 --> 07:46:58.850 align:start position:0%
bring fresh legislation forward in the
fall

07:46:58.850 --> 07:46:58.860 align:start position:0%
fall
 
07:47:01.670 --> 07:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
and it might be more appropriate
 
07:47:04.810 --> 07:47:04.820 align:start position:0%
legislation because it might be Guided
 
07:47:07.010 --> 07:47:07.020 align:start position:0%
by the guidance from the federal
 
07:47:09.830 --> 07:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
government so retain actually doesn't
 
07:47:11.750 --> 07:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
really buy us that much
 
07:47:13.788 --> 07:47:13.798 align:start position:0%
representative munz which is the
 
07:47:16.490 --> 07:47:16.500 align:start position:0%
question for the chair if we retain the
 
07:47:19.250 --> 07:47:19.260 align:start position:0%
bill can we work on it over the summer
 
07:47:19.260 --> 07:47:20.868 align:start position:0%
bill can we work on it over the summer
yes

07:47:20.868 --> 07:47:20.878 align:start position:0%
yes
 
07:47:22.490 --> 07:47:22.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:47:24.230 --> 07:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the motion to
 
07:47:25.628 --> 07:47:25.638 align:start position:0%
retain this bill
 
07:47:28.430 --> 07:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas Doug Thomas has a
 
07:47:30.770 --> 07:47:30.780 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair uh if this
 
07:47:35.390 --> 07:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
bill is retained would we be
 
07:47:39.490 --> 07:47:39.500 align:start position:0%
um able to direct other
 
07:47:44.448 --> 07:47:44.458 align:start position:0%
committees to look at this bill or are
 
07:47:46.368 --> 07:47:46.378 align:start position:0%
we relegated to just within this
 
07:47:46.378 --> 07:47:47.930 align:start position:0%
we relegated to just within this
committee

07:47:47.930 --> 07:47:47.940 align:start position:0%
committee
 
07:47:50.270 --> 07:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
it would just be within our committee
 
07:47:53.750 --> 07:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
and if we should retain the bill and
 
07:47:56.628 --> 07:47:56.638 align:start position:0%
then move it forward in November when it
 
07:47:59.208 --> 07:47:59.218 align:start position:0%
got to the house floor because it's an
 
07:48:01.310 --> 07:48:01.320 align:start position:0%
FN bill it would still probably have to
 
07:48:04.490 --> 07:48:04.500 align:start position:0%
go to the finance committee
 
07:48:07.070 --> 07:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams
 
07:48:08.628 --> 07:48:08.638 align:start position:0%
I just want to make a pitch for
 
07:48:10.850 --> 07:48:10.860 align:start position:0%
retaining because we are able to meet
 
07:48:13.730 --> 07:48:13.740 align:start position:0%
discuss and potentially amend it before
 
07:48:16.030 --> 07:48:16.040 align:start position:0%
it's reported out at the end of the year
 
07:48:18.530 --> 07:48:18.540 align:start position:0%
I do think that we could receive some
 
07:48:20.930 --> 07:48:20.940 align:start position:0%
very interesting Federal guidance uh say
 
07:48:23.690 --> 07:48:23.700 align:start position:0%
September October we could meet together
 
07:48:27.830 --> 07:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
and tweak it and then vote to send it as
 
07:48:29.750 --> 07:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
amended in November to the house floor
 
07:48:30.948 --> 07:48:30.958 align:start position:0%
so I think that there is a real
 
07:48:33.048 --> 07:48:33.058 align:start position:0%
opportunity here to extend our session
 
07:48:35.750 --> 07:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
instead of January to June and get that
 
07:48:38.270 --> 07:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
November Golden Nugget if that's the way
 
07:48:40.490 --> 07:48:40.500 align:start position:0%
things play out and I do think out of an
 
07:48:43.310 --> 07:48:43.320 align:start position:0%
abundance of caution it behooves us to
 
07:48:46.368 --> 07:48:46.378 align:start position:0%
be careful with our taxpayers money and
 
07:48:48.708 --> 07:48:48.718 align:start position:0%
if it's 90 plus million dollars it's
 
07:48:50.208 --> 07:48:50.218 align:start position:0%
worth hanging on to for a little bit
 
07:48:52.010 --> 07:48:52.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:48:52.020 --> 07:49:10.128 align:start position:0%
thank you
foreign

07:49:10.128 --> 07:49:10.138 align:start position:0%
 
07:49:12.468 --> 07:49:12.478 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll ask the clerk to call
 
07:49:16.128 --> 07:49:16.138 align:start position:0%
the role on the question of retain for
 
07:49:18.590 --> 07:49:18.600 align:start position:0%
house bill 630.
 
07:49:20.330 --> 07:49:20.340 align:start position:0%
Doug Thomas
 
07:49:20.340 --> 07:49:22.090 align:start position:0%
Doug Thomas
no

07:49:22.090 --> 07:49:22.100 align:start position:0%
no
 
07:49:25.310 --> 07:49:25.320 align:start position:0%
Janine nodder no
 
07:49:28.150 --> 07:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
David love no
 
07:49:30.468 --> 07:49:30.478 align:start position:0%

07:49:32.690 --> 07:49:32.700 align:start position:0%
Carol Brown no
 
07:49:35.208 --> 07:49:35.218 align:start position:0%
Lex barajny no
 
07:49:39.230 --> 07:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
JD Bernardi no Tom closure no
 
07:49:42.530 --> 07:49:42.540 align:start position:0%
James Summers no
 
07:49:46.250 --> 07:49:46.260 align:start position:0%
Rebecca McWilliams yes
 
07:49:48.888 --> 07:49:48.898 align:start position:0%
Jessica Grill yes
 
07:49:51.650 --> 07:49:51.660 align:start position:0%
Carrie spear yes
 
07:49:54.350 --> 07:49:54.360 align:start position:0%
lucious partial yes
 
07:49:56.510 --> 07:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
Tony Kaplan yes
 
07:50:01.910 --> 07:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
Chris muns yes Henry Noel yes Wendy
 
07:50:05.990 --> 07:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
Thomas yes Thomas Corman yes
 
07:50:09.830 --> 07:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
Heath Howard yes chairman Vose
 
07:50:09.840 --> 07:50:11.448 align:start position:0%
Heath Howard yes chairman Vose
no

07:50:11.448 --> 07:50:11.458 align:start position:0%
no
 
07:50:13.490 --> 07:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
10 to 10.
 
07:50:16.010 --> 07:50:16.020 align:start position:0%
so the motion to retain House Bill 630
 
07:50:20.208 --> 07:50:20.218 align:start position:0%
fails on a vote of 10 to 10. therefore
 
07:50:21.888 --> 07:50:21.898 align:start position:0%
this bill will have to be reported out
 
07:50:25.010 --> 07:50:25.020 align:start position:0%
to the house clerk as without
 
07:50:25.020 --> 07:50:26.930 align:start position:0%
to the house clerk as without
recommendation

07:50:26.930 --> 07:50:26.940 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
07:50:29.030 --> 07:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
so we'll need a
 
07:50:33.410 --> 07:50:33.420 align:start position:0%
calendar report for the side of ought to
 
07:50:33.420 --> 07:50:34.788 align:start position:0%
calendar report for the side of ought to
pass

07:50:34.788 --> 07:50:34.798 align:start position:0%
pass
 
07:50:36.830 --> 07:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams will you
 
07:50:40.190 --> 07:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
provide such a report I will thank you
 
07:50:42.288 --> 07:50:42.298 align:start position:0%
and we'll also need a calendar report
 
07:50:46.128 --> 07:50:46.138 align:start position:0%
for the motion of itl
 
07:50:48.350 --> 07:50:48.360 align:start position:0%
representative closure will you provide
 
07:50:51.888 --> 07:50:51.898 align:start position:0%
such a motion or such a report
 
07:50:54.650 --> 07:50:54.660 align:start position:0%
uh yes I couldn't do that chair
 
07:50:58.610 --> 07:50:58.620 align:start position:0%
okay excuse me I have a question to the
 
07:51:02.628 --> 07:51:02.638 align:start position:0%
chair we're recognized for a question
 
07:51:06.288 --> 07:51:06.298 align:start position:0%
is it possible or is there
 
07:51:06.298 --> 07:51:07.070 align:start position:0%
is it possible or is there
um

07:51:07.070 --> 07:51:07.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:51:11.030 --> 07:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
a way to fast-track this bill along with
 
07:51:13.250 --> 07:51:13.260 align:start position:0%
the other ones that
 
07:51:15.770 --> 07:51:15.780 align:start position:0%
come up first in the house to be heard
 
07:51:18.110 --> 07:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
that's up to the clerk and the speaker
 
07:51:20.448 --> 07:51:20.458 align:start position:0%
okay they schedule thank you the
 
07:51:23.510 --> 07:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
priority of bills on the calendar
 
07:51:25.670 --> 07:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
representative Nutter
 
07:51:28.610 --> 07:51:28.620 align:start position:0%
I had a question you just reminded me on
 
07:51:30.410 --> 07:51:30.420 align:start position:0%
our first day here you had mentioned
 
07:51:33.230 --> 07:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
that um we don't really deal in science
 
07:51:34.910 --> 07:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
here it's most Just Energy and
 
07:51:37.128 --> 07:51:37.138 align:start position:0%
Communications and you you had mentioned
 
07:51:39.410 --> 07:51:39.420 align:start position:0%
that we should rename the committee if
 
07:51:41.810 --> 07:51:41.820 align:start position:0%
we renamed the committee to energy and
 
07:51:43.670 --> 07:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
Communications it would move us up in
 
07:51:46.810 --> 07:51:46.820 align:start position:0%
 
07:51:50.690 --> 07:51:50.700 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent point
 
07:51:52.250 --> 07:51:52.260 align:start position:0%
I guess that's we'll have to take up
 
07:51:53.810 --> 07:51:53.820 align:start position:0%
with the speaker
 
07:51:55.910 --> 07:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
all right I guess we're down here I'm
 
07:51:57.530 --> 07:51:57.540 align:start position:0%
going to close the public hearing on
 
07:52:02.388 --> 07:52:02.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:52:04.968 --> 07:52:04.978 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I can't hear you do you have a
 
07:52:06.830 --> 07:52:06.840 align:start position:0%

oh did I say hearing okay exact session
 
07:52:17.330 --> 07:52:17.340 align:start position:0%

representative McWilliams
 
07:52:59.570 --> 07:52:59.580 align:start position:0%
thank you chair um I just want to
 
07:53:02.030 --> 07:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
reiterate House Bill 234
 
07:53:04.330 --> 07:53:04.340 align:start position:0%
was about wreck sweeping
 
07:53:07.128 --> 07:53:07.138 align:start position:0%
our Focus here is really on creating a
 
07:53:09.350 --> 07:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
long-term strategy for getting that
 
07:53:11.750 --> 07:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
triple or sometimes quadruple value for
 
07:53:13.548 --> 07:53:13.558 align:start position:0%
our single dollar so turning every
 
07:53:15.170 --> 07:53:15.180 align:start position:0%
dollar invested into three or four
 
07:53:17.948 --> 07:53:17.958 align:start position:0%
dollars worth of Smart Energy savings
 
07:53:21.650 --> 07:53:21.660 align:start position:0%
and so uh ending Rex sweeping would
 
07:53:23.868 --> 07:53:23.878 align:start position:0%
potentially help us long term get off of
 
07:53:26.150 --> 07:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
our addiction to natural gas and
 
07:53:28.490 --> 07:53:28.500 align:start position:0%
therefore reduce overall electric rates
 
07:53:31.010 --> 07:53:31.020 align:start position:0%
in the big picture long term 10-year
 
07:53:33.110 --> 07:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
strategy thank you
 
07:53:35.330 --> 07:53:35.340 align:start position:0%
representative Summers
 
07:53:37.968 --> 07:53:37.978 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh to speak this
 
07:53:40.610 --> 07:53:40.620 align:start position:0%
motion I I know for weeks we've been
 
07:53:43.610 --> 07:53:43.620 align:start position:0%
talking and had presentations by ISO New
 
07:53:45.110 --> 07:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
England the generators of New England
 
07:53:48.048 --> 07:53:48.058 align:start position:0%
and multiple other parties including the
 
07:53:50.510 --> 07:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
department of energy and such and all of
 
07:53:52.010 --> 07:53:52.020 align:start position:0%
them have claimed about and we've all
 
07:53:54.230 --> 07:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
had discussions about the the high
 
07:53:55.910 --> 07:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
electrical rates that we're paying in
 
07:53:58.250 --> 07:53:58.260 align:start position:0%
fact this morning even with the puc we
 
07:53:59.750 --> 07:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
talked about the rate prices everybody
 
07:54:01.190 --> 07:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
are paying everybody's paying for
 
07:54:03.770 --> 07:54:03.780 align:start position:0%
electricity and this bill if passed
 
07:54:07.190 --> 07:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
would increase the pay rate payers would
 
07:54:08.930 --> 07:54:08.940 align:start position:0%
charge the ratepayers three million
 
07:54:08.940 --> 07:54:10.070 align:start position:0%
charge the ratepayers three million
dollars

07:54:10.070 --> 07:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
07:54:12.350 --> 07:54:12.360 align:start position:0%
three million dollars to transfer this
 
07:54:15.350 --> 07:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
over for the ratepayers at this time I
 
07:54:17.690 --> 07:54:17.700 align:start position:0%
do not feel it is right to be raising
 
07:54:19.250 --> 07:54:19.260 align:start position:0%
the electrical rate so those people that
 
07:54:21.170 --> 07:54:21.180 align:start position:0%
are out there and our rate payers and I
 
07:54:22.730 --> 07:54:22.740 align:start position:0%
hope they're all watching right now and
 
07:54:26.208 --> 07:54:26.218 align:start position:0%
so I vote to itl this
 
07:54:29.030 --> 07:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you further comment on this bill
 
07:54:31.430 --> 07:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
representative muns
 
07:54:35.150 --> 07:54:35.160 align:start position:0%
in in one of the bills that we um we
 
07:54:37.730 --> 07:54:37.740 align:start position:0%
heard uh earlier today there was a lot
 
07:54:39.288 --> 07:54:39.298 align:start position:0%
of discussion about
 
07:54:41.990 --> 07:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
um you know taking of property
 
07:54:44.510 --> 07:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
and how that was wrong and how that
 
07:54:48.708 --> 07:54:48.718 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be allowed to continue and
 
07:54:52.850 --> 07:54:52.860 align:start position:0%
um I think one aspect of this bill is
 
07:54:55.388 --> 07:54:55.398 align:start position:0%
um just simply the the the the the the
 
07:54:57.888 --> 07:54:57.898 align:start position:0%
fairness of
 
07:55:00.350 --> 07:55:00.360 align:start position:0%
uh taking property away from people
 
07:55:02.570 --> 07:55:02.580 align:start position:0%
without their knowledge
 
07:55:05.030 --> 07:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
07:55:06.888 --> 07:55:06.898 align:start position:0%
you know
 
07:55:08.628 --> 07:55:08.638 align:start position:0%
um you know I think if nothing else
 
07:55:10.070 --> 07:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
that's one reason why we should be
 
07:55:12.048 --> 07:55:12.058 align:start position:0%
voting for this bill
 
07:55:14.930 --> 07:55:14.940 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi has a comment
 
07:55:19.788 --> 07:55:19.798 align:start position:0%
so uh thank you uh Mr chair uh with
 
07:55:21.468 --> 07:55:21.478 align:start position:0%
respect to
 
07:55:25.010 --> 07:55:25.020 align:start position:0%
um taking a property if one does not
 
07:55:27.650 --> 07:55:27.660 align:start position:0%
claim one's wrecks their abandoned
 
07:55:31.490 --> 07:55:31.500 align:start position:0%
property we in the in this legislature
 
07:55:35.448 --> 07:55:35.458 align:start position:0%
set a policy of allowing those wrecks to
 
07:55:39.048 --> 07:55:39.058 align:start position:0%
be claimed for the benefit of passing
 
07:55:42.770 --> 07:55:42.780 align:start position:0%
those those dollars back to through the
 
07:55:45.230 --> 07:55:45.240 align:start position:0%
utilities to the rate payers to reduce
 
07:55:47.570 --> 07:55:47.580 align:start position:0%
their costs that's what we need to do
 
07:55:51.650 --> 07:55:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
07:55:53.810 --> 07:55:53.820 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
07:55:56.388 --> 07:55:56.398 align:start position:0%
comment thank you Mr chair
 
07:55:58.070 --> 07:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
um I question
 
07:56:00.170 --> 07:56:00.180 align:start position:0%
um whether or not the property is
 
07:56:03.170 --> 07:56:03.180 align:start position:0%
abandoned if to a if to claim it is an
 
07:56:06.288 --> 07:56:06.298 align:start position:0%
onerous process which we saw um was
 
07:56:06.298 --> 07:56:08.388 align:start position:0%
onerous process which we saw um was
demonstrated

07:56:08.388 --> 07:56:08.398 align:start position:0%
demonstrated
 
07:56:09.948 --> 07:56:09.958 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:56:12.650 --> 07:56:12.660 align:start position:0%
to provide a little history when the
 
07:56:15.048 --> 07:56:15.058 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard was
 
07:56:17.150 --> 07:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
originally passed
 
07:56:21.110 --> 07:56:21.120 align:start position:0%
wreck sweeping was added to the initial
 
07:56:24.288 --> 07:56:24.298 align:start position:0%
legislation for the express purpose of
 
07:56:27.530 --> 07:56:27.540 align:start position:0%
keeping costs as low as possible by
 
07:56:30.610 --> 07:56:30.620 align:start position:0%
allowing the utilities to to
 
07:56:34.368 --> 07:56:34.378 align:start position:0%
reclaim those abandoned wrecks they were
 
07:56:38.270 --> 07:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
in enabled to reduce their costs and
 
07:56:39.888 --> 07:56:39.898 align:start position:0%
those costs were passed directly onto
 
07:56:42.590 --> 07:56:42.600 align:start position:0%
rate payers so that was the reason it
 
07:56:45.430 --> 07:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
was passed originally in the first place
 
07:56:49.128 --> 07:56:49.138 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't seem to me in this high
 
07:56:51.830 --> 07:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
cost environment that now is a good time
 
07:56:51.840 --> 07:56:52.910 align:start position:0%
cost environment that now is a good time
to

07:56:52.910 --> 07:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:56:54.490 --> 07:56:54.500 align:start position:0%
take away
 
07:56:58.010 --> 07:56:58.020 align:start position:0%
that protection for ratepayers by
 
07:57:00.110 --> 07:57:00.120 align:start position:0%
increasing their costs
 
07:57:02.388 --> 07:57:02.398 align:start position:0%
in addition to the increases they've
 
07:57:05.570 --> 07:57:05.580 align:start position:0%
already experienced in the last year
 
07:57:08.208 --> 07:57:08.218 align:start position:0%
representative Carmen has a comment
 
07:57:10.910 --> 07:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh pursuant to what
 
07:57:14.090 --> 07:57:14.100 align:start position:0%
you just said I'm wondering do you can
 
07:57:15.708 --> 07:57:15.718 align:start position:0%
we ever see a time when it would make
 
07:57:18.288 --> 07:57:18.298 align:start position:0%
sense to do this when when costs are
 
07:57:18.298 --> 07:57:19.548 align:start position:0%
sense to do this when when costs are
lower

07:57:19.548 --> 07:57:19.558 align:start position:0%
lower
 
07:57:22.190 --> 07:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
well I can tell you that this wreck
 
07:57:24.708 --> 07:57:24.718 align:start position:0%
sweeping repeal has a has come before
 
07:57:27.530 --> 07:57:27.540 align:start position:0%
this legislature several times in the
 
07:57:29.690 --> 07:57:29.700 align:start position:0%
eight plus years I've been here and it's
 
07:57:32.868 --> 07:57:32.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:57:37.190 --> 07:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:57:39.468 --> 07:57:39.478 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams
 
07:57:41.690 --> 07:57:41.700 align:start position:0%
I just want to add on to the history of
 
07:57:44.810 --> 07:57:44.820 align:start position:0%
um wreck Sweeping in the RPS when this
 
07:57:49.368 --> 07:57:49.378 align:start position:0%
was first added a dollar one dollar was
 
07:57:53.350 --> 07:57:53.360 align:start position:0%
taken from everybody's monthly bill and
 
07:57:56.090 --> 07:57:56.100 align:start position:0%
applied to use for Energy Efficiency
 
07:57:56.100 --> 07:57:57.590 align:start position:0%
applied to use for Energy Efficiency
programs

07:57:57.590 --> 07:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
programs
 
07:57:59.810 --> 07:57:59.820 align:start position:0%
and things have changed since that was
 
07:58:04.670 --> 07:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
enacted years ago and so one dollar is
 
07:58:07.250 --> 07:58:07.260 align:start position:0%
still the amount that we are using for
 
07:58:09.650 --> 07:58:09.660 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency and we refund the rest
 
07:58:12.530 --> 07:58:12.540 align:start position:0%
of the money back to rate payers and and
 
07:58:15.590 --> 07:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
I I really am sensitive to the fact that
 
07:58:17.208 --> 07:58:17.218 align:start position:0%
we are in an energy Spike right now and
 
07:58:18.948 --> 07:58:18.958 align:start position:0%
people are paying double what they've
 
07:58:20.448 --> 07:58:20.458 align:start position:0%
been paying with their electric rates
 
07:58:21.830 --> 07:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
and part of that is because
 
07:58:24.170 --> 07:58:24.180 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we really haven't had a
 
07:58:26.030 --> 07:58:26.040 align:start position:0%
long-term strategy to diversify our
 
07:58:28.548 --> 07:58:28.558 align:start position:0%
portfolio mix and so we haven't had a
 
07:58:30.350 --> 07:58:30.360 align:start position:0%
way of addressing that low-hanging fruit
 
07:58:32.090 --> 07:58:32.100 align:start position:0%
the Energy Efficiency weatherization
 
07:58:34.128 --> 07:58:34.138 align:start position:0%
programs we really haven't funded them
 
07:58:35.570 --> 07:58:35.580 align:start position:0%
to the extent that other states around
 
07:58:38.150 --> 07:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
us have and therefore we are hurting for
 
07:58:40.250 --> 07:58:40.260 align:start position:0%
that and we have people who are hurting
 
07:58:42.048 --> 07:58:42.058 align:start position:0%
paying to still heat the outdoors
 
07:58:43.548 --> 07:58:43.558 align:start position:0%
because they need more insulation in
 
07:58:45.288 --> 07:58:45.298 align:start position:0%
their homes they can't access funds to
 
07:58:47.090 --> 07:58:47.100 align:start position:0%
do that right now we are in a pretty
 
07:58:48.948 --> 07:58:48.958 align:start position:0%
pickle and I really feel for my
 
07:58:50.810 --> 07:58:50.820 align:start position:0%
constituents who are hurting and not
 
07:58:52.190 --> 07:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
able to pay their electric bills right
 
07:58:54.468 --> 07:58:54.478 align:start position:0%
now but doing this is part of a longer
 
07:58:56.270 --> 07:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
strategy to make sure that we do have
 
07:58:58.310 --> 07:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
money and we can diversify fire Energy
 
07:59:00.468 --> 07:59:00.478 align:start position:0%
Mix because that's what we need is we
 
07:59:02.330 --> 07:59:02.340 align:start position:0%
need to stand up and be proud that we
 
07:59:03.830 --> 07:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
are New Hampshire and we have a strategy
 
07:59:06.830 --> 07:59:06.840 align:start position:0%
to get out of this problem and so yes we
 
07:59:08.690 --> 07:59:08.700 align:start position:0%
do need to do something in order to
 
07:59:10.128 --> 07:59:10.138 align:start position:0%
change what we've been doing because
 
07:59:11.930 --> 07:59:11.940 align:start position:0%
what we've been doing isn't working
 
07:59:13.670 --> 07:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:59:15.830 --> 07:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative McWilliams you
 
07:59:19.548 --> 07:59:19.558 align:start position:0%
have conflated Reggie rebates and wreck
 
07:59:23.150 --> 07:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:59:25.910 --> 07:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
further comments on this uh
 
07:59:25.920 --> 07:59:28.730 align:start position:0%
further comments on this uh
legislation

James Summers yes Rebecca McWilliams
 
08:00:01.680 --> 08:00:03.350 align:start position:0%
James Summers yes Rebecca McWilliams
no

08:00:03.350 --> 08:00:03.360 align:start position:0%

10 10.
 
08:00:33.110 --> 08:00:33.120 align:start position:0%
so by a vote of 10 to 10 the motion to
 
08:00:37.490 --> 08:00:37.500 align:start position:0%
itl House Bill 234 fails
 
08:00:40.250 --> 08:00:40.260 align:start position:0%
and the chair is certain that a motion
 
08:00:44.448 --> 08:00:44.458 align:start position:0%
to pass HB 234 would also fail
 
08:00:49.788 --> 08:00:49.798 align:start position:0%
 
08:00:52.070 --> 08:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
send this bill to the floor without
 
08:00:53.990 --> 08:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation the other is to retain
 
08:00:57.110 --> 08:00:57.120 align:start position:0%
the bill I see no use in retaining the
 
08:00:57.120 --> 08:00:57.888 align:start position:0%
the bill I see no use in retaining the
bill

08:00:57.888 --> 08:00:57.898 align:start position:0%
bill
 
08:01:01.368 --> 08:01:01.378 align:start position:0%
so I am going to rule that this bill
 
08:01:02.990 --> 08:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
will go forward to the floor without
 
08:01:03.000 --> 08:01:04.968 align:start position:0%
will go forward to the floor without
recommendation

08:01:04.968 --> 08:01:04.978 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
08:01:06.548 --> 08:01:06.558 align:start position:0%
so I ask
 
08:01:09.770 --> 08:01:09.780 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams to appoint
 
08:01:12.770 --> 08:01:12.780 align:start position:0%

08:01:22.968 --> 08:01:22.978 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I didn't hear what you said
 
08:01:25.670 --> 08:01:25.680 align:start position:0%

08:02:03.530 --> 08:02:03.540 align:start position:0%

do we have discussion on this amendment

I'll give you a a minute or two to read
 
08:03:13.368 --> 08:03:13.378 align:start position:0%
 
08:03:16.910 --> 08:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
I have read it and I can tell you that
 
08:03:20.448 --> 08:03:20.458 align:start position:0%
what this Amendment essentially does is
 
08:03:20.458 --> 08:03:21.410 align:start position:0%
what this Amendment essentially does is
it

08:03:21.410 --> 08:03:21.420 align:start position:0%
it
 
08:03:25.190 --> 08:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
makes the rebate program identified by
 
08:03:26.570 --> 08:03:26.580 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
08:03:30.048 --> 08:03:30.058 align:start position:0%
last from July 1st of 2023 through June
 
08:03:32.330 --> 08:03:32.340 align:start position:0%
30th of 2025.
 
08:03:34.968 --> 08:03:34.978 align:start position:0%
a two-year period
 
08:03:36.708 --> 08:03:36.718 align:start position:0%
it also
 
08:03:39.170 --> 08:03:39.180 align:start position:0%
restores language to the bill that was
 
08:03:41.330 --> 08:03:41.340 align:start position:0%
removed from the original version of the
 
08:03:41.340 --> 08:03:42.170 align:start position:0%
removed from the original version of the
bill

08:03:42.170 --> 08:03:42.180 align:start position:0%
bill
 
08:03:46.368 --> 08:03:46.378 align:start position:0%
that allows all of the
 
08:03:51.590 --> 08:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
administrative costs to be extracted as
 
08:03:55.910 --> 08:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
before and other uses of the fund Monies
 
08:04:00.110 --> 08:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
to be kept intact rather than deleted
 
08:04:00.120 --> 08:04:01.910 align:start position:0%
to be kept intact rather than deleted
from

08:04:01.910 --> 08:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
from
 
08:04:01.920 --> 08:04:03.888 align:start position:0%
from
statute

08:04:03.888 --> 08:04:03.898 align:start position:0%
statute
 
08:04:06.948 --> 08:04:06.958 align:start position:0%
so those are the changes that the
 
08:04:08.990 --> 08:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
that the amendment makes
 
08:04:12.948 --> 08:04:12.958 align:start position:0%
and I think this is a a much more
 
08:04:15.288 --> 08:04:15.298 align:start position:0%
defendable Amendment and a much more
 
08:04:16.910 --> 08:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
defendable makes the bill much more
 
08:04:19.250 --> 08:04:19.260 align:start position:0%
defendable bill
 
08:04:20.690 --> 08:04:20.700 align:start position:0%
anybody else have comments
 
08:04:23.030 --> 08:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas Doug Thomas has a
 
08:04:25.968 --> 08:04:25.978 align:start position:0%
comment thank you Mr chair uh I I concur
 
08:04:29.330 --> 08:04:29.340 align:start position:0%
I I think this amendment uh makes this a
 
08:04:31.250 --> 08:04:31.260 align:start position:0%
better Bill particularly during these
 
08:04:34.128 --> 08:04:34.138 align:start position:0%
rough times that we do want to show our
 
08:04:36.888 --> 08:04:36.898 align:start position:0%
people that we are trying in some way
 
08:04:39.590 --> 08:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
any way we can to help them in the short
 
08:04:42.910 --> 08:04:42.920 align:start position:0%
term to help them during this period of
 
08:04:45.830 --> 08:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
of high rates and it gives us the
 
08:04:48.830 --> 08:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go back to where we were
 
08:04:51.170 --> 08:04:51.180 align:start position:0%
when perhaps times are a little better I
 
08:04:52.910 --> 08:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
think this amendment should be adopted
 
08:04:56.948 --> 08:04:56.958 align:start position:0%
 
08:04:59.868 --> 08:04:59.878 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a comment I I
 
08:05:01.490 --> 08:05:01.500 align:start position:0%

08:05:04.788 --> 08:05:04.798 align:start position:0%
um there's there's new language or looks
 
08:05:06.288 --> 08:05:06.298 align:start position:0%
like new language that wasn't in the
 
08:05:09.770 --> 08:05:09.780 align:start position:0%

docket
could

08:05:16.968 --> 08:05:16.978 align:start position:0%
could
 
08:05:19.548 --> 08:05:19.558 align:start position:0%
um Somebody explain that yes you are
 
08:05:21.230 --> 08:05:21.240 align:start position:0%

08:05:25.368 --> 08:05:25.378 align:start position:0%
that so lines 25 through 29
 
08:05:27.468 --> 08:05:27.478 align:start position:0%
request that the Public Utilities

seven or eight million dollars
 
08:05:43.548 --> 08:05:43.558 align:start position:0%
uh would be distributed to rate payers
 
08:05:46.010 --> 08:05:46.020 align:start position:0%
chances are they would apply
 
08:05:49.010 --> 08:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
a rate adjustment to the
 
08:05:49.020 --> 08:05:50.990 align:start position:0%

08:06:53.510 --> 08:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
I I still think this uh
 
08:06:55.190 --> 08:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
this amendment would have the effect of
 
08:06:57.530 --> 08:06:57.540 align:start position:0%
gutting you know the renewable energy
 
08:06:59.570 --> 08:06:59.580 align:start position:0%
fund and therefore it would hurt the New
 
08:07:00.948 --> 08:07:00.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Safe program and when you when
 
08:07:02.150 --> 08:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
you're feeling cold you don't burn the
 
08:07:05.948 --> 08:07:05.958 align:start position:0%
 
08:07:09.170 --> 08:07:09.180 align:start position:0%

08:07:13.430 --> 08:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
um the unamended version is permanent
 
08:07:17.990 --> 08:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
08:07:20.510 --> 08:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
that would be an argument for
 
08:07:23.930 --> 08:07:23.940 align:start position:0%
uh adopting the amendment
 
08:07:27.708 --> 08:07:27.718 align:start position:0%
further comment representative muns
 
08:07:29.628 --> 08:07:29.638 align:start position:0%
sorry just another another question
 
08:07:32.030 --> 08:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
regarding that that language about the
 
08:07:33.530 --> 08:07:33.540 align:start position:0%
the docket
 
08:07:35.330 --> 08:07:35.340 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm sure the intent was that it
 
08:07:38.990 --> 08:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
would only apply to the two-year period
 
08:07:42.230 --> 08:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
where the rates are being rebated but
 
08:07:47.208 --> 08:07:47.218 align:start position:0%
 
08:07:51.170 --> 08:07:51.180 align:start position:0%
 
08:07:55.730 --> 08:07:55.740 align:start position:0%
what language uh causes you concern well
 
08:07:58.010 --> 08:07:58.020 align:start position:0%
the fact that you know it it talks about
 
08:08:00.530 --> 08:08:00.540 align:start position:0%
how monies in the renewable energy fund
 
08:08:04.490 --> 08:08:04.500 align:start position:0%
under RSA 362 f8 as amended will be
 
08:08:07.010 --> 08:08:07.020 align:start position:0%
distributed to Tech to rate payers it
 
08:08:09.830 --> 08:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't say anything about the temporary
 
08:08:14.868 --> 08:08:14.878 align:start position:0%
 
08:08:18.170 --> 08:08:18.180 align:start position:0%
but the amendment the key language here
 
08:08:21.590 --> 08:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
is as amended by this act
 
08:08:24.110 --> 08:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
the amended language specifies a
 
08:08:25.968 --> 08:08:25.978 align:start position:0%
two-year period if I'm if everybody else
 
08:08:27.468 --> 08:08:27.478 align:start position:0%
is fine with that I'm I'm fine okay
 
08:08:34.670 --> 08:08:34.680 align:start position:0%

and I will recognize representative
 
08:14:51.708 --> 08:14:51.718 align:start position:0%
 
08:14:53.868 --> 08:14:53.878 align:start position:0%
I wasn't paying attention I'm sorry and
 
08:14:55.670 --> 08:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
I don't even know what the bill is but
 
08:14:59.690 --> 08:14:59.700 align:start position:0%
my papers I'll spill 418 relative to
 
08:15:01.850 --> 08:15:01.860 align:start position:0%
eliminating the rebates distributed by
 
08:15:04.788 --> 08:15:04.798 align:start position:0%
the Energy Efficiency fund
 
08:15:06.230 --> 08:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
08:15:08.570 --> 08:15:08.580 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry Mr chairman my let's add my
 
08:15:13.128 --> 08:15:13.138 align:start position:0%
 
08:15:16.010 --> 08:15:16.020 align:start position:0%
representative Summers is recognized my
 
08:15:17.930 --> 08:15:17.940 align:start position:0%
second emotion so it's been moved and
 
08:15:20.948 --> 08:15:20.958 align:start position:0%
seconded that we itl house bill
 
08:15:25.090 --> 08:15:25.100 align:start position:0%
418fn is there any discussion
 
08:15:30.110 --> 08:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
08:15:32.628 --> 08:15:32.638 align:start position:0%
I have my mind just I I don't have
 
08:15:35.930 --> 08:15:35.940 align:start position:0%
anything to say right now I'm sorry okay
 
08:15:39.650 --> 08:15:39.660 align:start position:0%
to refresh everyone's uh memory this is
 
08:15:41.510 --> 08:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
a bill that
 
08:15:45.888 --> 08:15:45.898 align:start position:0%
removes the existing rebates of Reggie
 
08:15:48.708 --> 08:15:48.718 align:start position:0%
money we'll add about 40 million dollars
 
08:15:52.250 --> 08:15:52.260 align:start position:0%
to ratepayers costs in a time of
 
08:15:55.310 --> 08:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
extremely high energy rates extremely
 
08:15:56.868 --> 08:15:56.878 align:start position:0%
high inflation
 
08:15:59.270 --> 08:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
it will be a slap in the face to the
 
08:16:01.128 --> 08:16:01.138 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire
 
08:16:03.288 --> 08:16:03.298 align:start position:0%
and I certainly could not support doing
 
08:16:07.548 --> 08:16:07.558 align:start position:0%
that so I will be voting to
 
08:16:11.388 --> 08:16:11.398 align:start position:0%
yes to itl House Bill 418 representative
 
08:16:11.398 --> 08:16:12.530 align:start position:0%
yes to itl House Bill 418 representative

08:16:14.388 --> 08:16:14.398 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman you've refreshed
 
08:16:16.610 --> 08:16:16.620 align:start position:0%
my memory so everything you just said
 
08:16:16.620 --> 08:16:20.448 align:start position:0%
my memory so everything you just said
ditto

08:16:20.448 --> 08:16:20.458 align:start position:0%

08:16:29.330 --> 08:16:29.340 align:start position:0%
thank you chair Bose I think I jumped
 
08:16:32.030 --> 08:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
the gun on the previous Bill my comments
 
08:16:34.490 --> 08:16:34.500 align:start position:0%
about the first dollar for Reggie were
 
08:16:37.250 --> 08:16:37.260 align:start position:0%
for this bill and my concerns are the
 
08:16:39.350 --> 08:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
same for both bills in terms of it being
 
08:16:41.930 --> 08:16:41.940 align:start position:0%
an energy spike in constituents having a
 
08:16:44.150 --> 08:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
really tough time paying bills I feel
 
08:16:48.048 --> 08:16:48.058 align:start position:0%
that also I have concerns for the long
 
08:16:49.730 --> 08:16:49.740 align:start position:0%
term that we need to get off of our
 
08:16:52.368 --> 08:16:52.378 align:start position:0%
addiction to Natural Gas diversify our
 
08:16:55.548 --> 08:16:55.558 align:start position:0%
energy Supply and fund Energy Efficiency
 
08:16:57.468 --> 08:16:57.478 align:start position:0%
weatherization projects to make sure
 
08:16:58.548 --> 08:16:58.558 align:start position:0%
that our buildings are actually
 
08:17:01.250 --> 08:17:01.260 align:start position:0%
retaining heat in the winter and so for
 
08:17:03.230 --> 08:17:03.240 align:start position:0%
that reason this is part of a 10-year
 
08:17:05.690 --> 08:17:05.700 align:start position:0%
strategy to reduce costs overall as
 
08:17:08.628 --> 08:17:08.638 align:start position:0%
opposed to Distributing pennies back to
 
08:17:11.948 --> 08:17:11.958 align:start position:0%
our ratepayers thank you
 
08:17:14.090 --> 08:17:14.100 align:start position:0%
additional comments
 
08:17:16.850 --> 08:17:16.860 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas thank you Mr
 
08:17:18.830 --> 08:17:18.840 align:start position:0%
chair I'd like to disclose that I work
 
08:17:20.510 --> 08:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
for a company that has a contract with
 
08:17:20.520 --> 08:17:21.830 align:start position:0%
for a company that has a contract with

08:17:24.888 --> 08:17:24.898 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Summers
 
08:17:26.448 --> 08:17:26.458 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'd just like to
 
08:17:30.468 --> 08:17:30.478 align:start position:0%
add that uh earlier in HB 234fn I
 
08:17:32.208 --> 08:17:32.218 align:start position:0%
mentioned that our rate payers will be
 
08:17:34.730 --> 08:17:34.740 align:start position:0%
paying 3 million extra dollars on their
 
08:17:37.968 --> 08:17:37.978 align:start position:0%
rates this as has been mentioned will
 
08:17:39.468 --> 08:17:39.478 align:start position:0%
increase it to where they'll be paying
 
08:17:42.350 --> 08:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
40 million dollars more on their rates I
 
08:17:46.010 --> 08:17:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
08:17:49.548 --> 08:17:49.558 align:start position:0%
additional comments representative muns
 
08:17:51.590 --> 08:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'd just like to put
 
08:17:53.510 --> 08:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
that number into context I mean we heard
 
08:17:56.150 --> 08:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
con we heard uh testimony from the
 
08:17:58.368 --> 08:17:58.378 align:start position:0%
Department of energy that
 
08:18:00.888 --> 08:18:00.898 align:start position:0%
um the impact on the average rate rate
 
08:18:04.610 --> 08:18:04.620 align:start position:0%
payer would be 1.77 a month or 28
 
08:18:07.750 --> 08:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
dollars a year or 21 a year
 
08:18:11.448 --> 08:18:11.458 align:start position:0%
not insignificant but um I think
 
08:18:11.458 --> 08:18:11.990 align:start position:0%
not insignificant but um I think
um

08:18:11.990 --> 08:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:18:14.330 --> 08:18:14.340 align:start position:0%
the people of New Hampshire are smart
 
08:18:16.850 --> 08:18:16.860 align:start position:0%
enough to realize that we do need to get
 
08:18:20.570 --> 08:18:20.580 align:start position:0%
off of our addiction to natural gas and
 
08:18:24.888 --> 08:18:24.898 align:start position:0%
an investment of 1.77 a month is is a
 
08:18:27.350 --> 08:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
small investment to make that to make to
 
08:18:31.670 --> 08:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
make to help make that happen thank you
 
08:18:31.680 --> 08:18:32.888 align:start position:0%
make to help make that happen thank you
foreign

08:18:32.888 --> 08:18:32.898 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
08:18:37.310 --> 08:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
wonders if it's wise to move away from
 
08:18:38.990 --> 08:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
natural gas if we have nothing
 
08:18:41.270 --> 08:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
Dependable to
 
08:18:42.948 --> 08:18:42.958 align:start position:0%
replace it with
 
08:18:46.128 --> 08:18:46.138 align:start position:0%
further comments Mr chairman
 
08:18:48.170 --> 08:18:48.180 align:start position:0%
representative muns one of the reasons
 
08:18:50.150 --> 08:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
we don't have anything to turn to turn
 
08:18:51.948 --> 08:18:51.958 align:start position:0%
to is because we haven't been making the
 
08:18:53.990 --> 08:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
Investments that we need to be for the
 
08:18:58.190 --> 08:18:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
08:19:00.770 --> 08:19:00.780 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi
 
08:19:03.048 --> 08:19:03.058 align:start position:0%
so representative Munns I I don't
 
08:19:05.930 --> 08:19:05.940 align:start position:0%
understand what you want to replace uh
 
08:19:08.270 --> 08:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
natural gas with what we really need to
 
08:19:10.850 --> 08:19:10.860 align:start position:0%
do is reduce the price of natural gas in
 
08:19:13.570 --> 08:19:13.580 align:start position:0%
the United States and get it here
 
08:19:16.490 --> 08:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
to have uh
 
08:19:20.150 --> 08:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
solar and wind as a only additional new
 
08:19:22.670 --> 08:19:22.680 align:start position:0%
source of power both of them are
 
08:19:26.090 --> 08:19:26.100 align:start position:0%
unreliable even in the ISO
 
08:19:30.170 --> 08:19:30.180 align:start position:0%
New England presentation page 17 their
 
08:19:33.250 --> 08:19:33.260 align:start position:0%
footnotes indicate that if we had
 
08:19:35.628 --> 08:19:35.638 align:start position:0%
extensive Reliance on that kind of power
 
08:19:38.570 --> 08:19:38.580 align:start position:0%
we would need to have backup power that
 
08:19:43.310 --> 08:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
was reliable we don't we cannot rely on
 
08:19:47.090 --> 08:19:47.100 align:start position:0%
and put all our eggs in Renewables as a
 
08:19:51.288 --> 08:19:51.298 align:start position:0%
way to as a way to Supply Power for the
 
08:19:54.548 --> 08:19:54.558 align:start position:0%
future we need a reliable source
 
08:19:57.048 --> 08:19:57.058 align:start position:0%
representative Nutter has a comment
 
08:19:58.968 --> 08:19:58.978 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
08:20:02.510 --> 08:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
um this bill is a tax a cap and trade
 
08:20:05.690 --> 08:20:05.700 align:start position:0%
scheme now if to add on to what
 
08:20:07.310 --> 08:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi just said about
 
08:20:07.320 --> 08:20:08.690 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi just said about
replacing

08:20:08.690 --> 08:20:08.700 align:start position:0%
replacing
 
08:20:11.270 --> 08:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
um our reliable sources of energy with
 
08:20:14.930 --> 08:20:14.940 align:start position:0%
solar uh this is what what it would what
 
08:20:16.250 --> 08:20:16.260 align:start position:0%
it would mean replacing four
 
08:20:17.810 --> 08:20:17.820 align:start position:0%
conventional power plants would
 
08:20:20.330 --> 08:20:20.340 align:start position:0%
necessitate a wind farm the size of
 
08:20:22.850 --> 08:20:22.860 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island to replace all conventional
 
08:20:25.010 --> 08:20:25.020 align:start position:0%
power plants require land larger than
 
08:20:27.468 --> 08:20:27.478 align:start position:0%
the state of California
 
08:20:29.750 --> 08:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
this is um from an energy conference I
 
08:20:31.850 --> 08:20:31.860 align:start position:0%
went to there's tens of thousands of
 
08:20:33.288 --> 08:20:33.298 align:start position:0%
scientists that you never get to hear
 
08:20:36.110 --> 08:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
about but they back this up solar panels
 
08:20:38.030 --> 08:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
create three times more toxic waste per
 
08:20:39.830 --> 08:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
unit of energy produced than nuclear
 
08:20:42.830 --> 08:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
power plant doubling the output of
 
08:20:44.868 --> 08:20:44.878 align:start position:0%
carbon dioxide wouldn't do much it's
 
08:20:47.090 --> 08:20:47.100 align:start position:0%
very little however eliminating carbon
 
08:20:50.030 --> 08:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
dioxide would have a minuscule effect to
 
08:20:52.490 --> 08:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
to this was the if you remember from the
 
08:20:56.330 --> 08:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
hearing I had asked Mr Fitzgerald what
 
08:20:59.530 --> 08:20:59.540 align:start position:0%
that number was it's
 
08:21:02.570 --> 08:21:02.580 align:start position:0%
0.002 percent
 
08:21:05.510 --> 08:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a comment
 
08:21:08.230 --> 08:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair just to respond to
 
08:21:11.150 --> 08:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi's comment I
 
08:21:13.368 --> 08:21:13.378 align:start position:0%
agree that we need reliable sources you
 
08:21:14.990 --> 08:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
know I I don't I don't see any way to
 
08:21:17.030 --> 08:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
dispute that but I would point out that
 
08:21:19.368 --> 08:21:19.378 align:start position:0%
during the times that we are availing
 
08:21:21.830 --> 08:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
ourselves of energy from solar or wind
 
08:21:24.830 --> 08:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
or whatever else that means that that's
 
08:21:28.368 --> 08:21:28.378 align:start position:0%
that much less natural gas that we need
 
08:21:30.048 --> 08:21:30.058 align:start position:0%
to use and it's a way that we can reduce
 
08:21:35.170 --> 08:21:35.180 align:start position:0%
 
08:21:37.670 --> 08:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi
 
08:21:40.368 --> 08:21:40.378 align:start position:0%
so I I agree when when the sun is
 
08:21:42.288 --> 08:21:42.298 align:start position:0%
shining and when the wind is blowing
 
08:21:46.368 --> 08:21:46.378 align:start position:0%
appropriately one can reduce some of the
 
08:21:48.708 --> 08:21:48.718 align:start position:0%
power needs right now the sun is not
 
08:21:52.128 --> 08:21:52.138 align:start position:0%
shining the wind is blowing so hard the
 
08:21:53.868 --> 08:21:53.878 align:start position:0%
windmills won't work
 
08:21:57.170 --> 08:21:57.180 align:start position:0%
so we have nothing reliable in the
 
08:21:59.930 --> 08:21:59.940 align:start position:0%
renewable Corridor to fill that Gap yet
 
08:22:02.868 --> 08:22:02.878 align:start position:0%
we need power so we have to have
 
08:22:06.350 --> 08:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
something we can turn on and use and
 
08:22:10.490 --> 08:22:10.500 align:start position:0%
that in in this Arena right now the best
 
08:22:13.250 --> 08:22:13.260 align:start position:0%
that we the best that we have is nuclear
 
08:22:17.090 --> 08:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
and natural gas
 
08:22:19.310 --> 08:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas did you have
 
08:22:22.010 --> 08:22:22.020 align:start position:0%
a comment I did um thank you I remember
 
08:22:25.190 --> 08:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh in one of the early sessions you said
 
08:22:26.930 --> 08:22:26.940 align:start position:0%
that you didn't want opinions you wanted
 
08:22:30.110 --> 08:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
everything backed up with references
 
08:22:32.750 --> 08:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
um in in light of that I would like uh
 
08:22:35.030 --> 08:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative Nadder to share the name
 
08:22:36.830 --> 08:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
of the conference that she attended and
 
08:22:39.048 --> 08:22:39.058 align:start position:0%
to provide the documents that she's
 
08:22:41.510 --> 08:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
referring to for this this
 
08:22:44.448 --> 08:22:44.458 align:start position:0%
data that she's probably to be precise
 
08:22:47.150 --> 08:22:47.160 align:start position:0%
what I said was we don't want opinions
 
08:22:50.650 --> 08:22:50.660 align:start position:0%
in public hearings in executive session
 
08:22:54.468 --> 08:22:54.478 align:start position:0%
it's perfectly fine to offer opinions
 
08:22:56.990 --> 08:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
although it's also perfectly fine to ask
 
08:22:59.628 --> 08:22:59.638 align:start position:0%
members how they arrived at their
 
08:23:01.670 --> 08:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
opinion I would like to ask how so I
 
08:23:03.110 --> 08:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
will allow the question thank you very
 
08:23:05.690 --> 08:23:05.700 align:start position:0%
much Mr chair
 
08:23:06.948 --> 08:23:06.958 align:start position:0%
the answer
 
08:23:10.730 --> 08:23:10.740 align:start position:0%
Dr holder thus from Germany
 
08:23:13.070 --> 08:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
and our chairman was at this conference
 
08:23:16.610 --> 08:23:16.620 align:start position:0%
with me it was several I brought home a
 
08:23:18.708 --> 08:23:18.718 align:start position:0%
stack of books the name of the
 
08:23:20.570 --> 08:23:20.580 align:start position:0%
conference please I don't remember the
 
08:23:23.208 --> 08:23:23.218 align:start position:0%
name of the conference
 
08:23:25.190 --> 08:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan has a question
 
08:23:26.930 --> 08:23:26.940 align:start position:0%
we're hearing all kinds of opinions here
 
08:23:28.788 --> 08:23:28.798 align:start position:0%
about the windmills not working and
 
08:23:30.770 --> 08:23:30.780 align:start position:0%
about this that and the other I mean
 
08:23:32.750 --> 08:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
these are just unfounded opinions and
 
08:23:34.788 --> 08:23:34.798 align:start position:0%
that may be fine in an executive session
 
08:23:36.590 --> 08:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
but the fact is
 
08:23:39.670 --> 08:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
that everywhere in the world
 
08:23:41.990 --> 08:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
the biggest market gains in the energy
 
08:23:44.150 --> 08:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
sector are being made by solar and wind
 
08:23:47.448 --> 08:23:47.458 align:start position:0%
and that the intermittent issue is being
 
08:23:49.190 --> 08:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
taken care of with the battery
 
08:23:50.868 --> 08:23:50.878 align:start position:0%
technologies that are improving all the
 
08:23:52.490 --> 08:23:52.500 align:start position:0%
time now we might not be able to
 
08:23:54.048 --> 08:23:54.058 align:start position:0%
implement those right away in New
 
08:23:55.730 --> 08:23:55.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but we can certainly start
 
08:23:58.610 --> 08:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
planning to diversify our Energy Mix and
 
08:24:00.170 --> 08:24:00.180 align:start position:0%
that's why we're as representative
 
08:24:01.610 --> 08:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
McWilliam said that's why we're in the
 
08:24:03.350 --> 08:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
pickle that we're in is because we
 
08:24:05.570 --> 08:24:05.580 align:start position:0%
haven't been doing that
 
08:24:07.430 --> 08:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
and we need to start doing it and that
 
08:24:09.288 --> 08:24:09.298 align:start position:0%
that's what this this bill is all about
 
08:24:10.910 --> 08:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
is we need to start moving quicker
 
08:24:14.690 --> 08:24:14.700 align:start position:0%
towards the Diversified Energy Mix
 
08:24:17.030 --> 08:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has a comment
 
08:24:19.310 --> 08:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just want to um
 
08:24:22.090 --> 08:24:22.100 align:start position:0%
comment that regarding natural gas
 
08:24:25.368 --> 08:24:25.378 align:start position:0%
my my district Londonderry has the
 
08:24:27.468 --> 08:24:27.478 align:start position:0%
natural gas plant which is the second
 
08:24:30.430 --> 08:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
largest producer of energy in this state
 
08:24:35.628 --> 08:24:35.638 align:start position:0%
and uh I do the calculation on what
 
08:24:38.150 --> 08:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
would we need to replace that plant if
 
08:24:41.388 --> 08:24:41.398 align:start position:0%
we did with solar cells solar panels and
 
08:24:44.510 --> 08:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
it would cover uh over half
 
08:24:49.190 --> 08:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
the the area of my town alone so you
 
08:24:51.590 --> 08:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
know we we need both
 
08:24:53.990 --> 08:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
we need to do both we need to keep
 
08:24:57.410 --> 08:24:57.420 align:start position:0%
natural gas as well and uh any
 
08:24:59.090 --> 08:24:59.100 align:start position:0%
presumptions that we need to get rid of
 
08:25:03.288 --> 08:25:03.298 align:start position:0%
natural gas I think is perhaps farther
 
08:25:05.510 --> 08:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
than I can see in my lifetime right now
 
08:25:08.030 --> 08:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
because of the fact of being unreliable
 
08:25:10.730 --> 08:25:10.740 align:start position:0%
in in the other so we need the Baseline
 
08:25:13.010 --> 08:25:13.020 align:start position:0%
we need the Baseline plants we need the
 
08:25:16.730 --> 08:25:16.740 align:start position:0%
net the renewable plants we cannot just
 
08:25:19.010 --> 08:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
dismiss natural gas right now we're
 
08:25:20.750 --> 08:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
trying to get the price down when we do
 
08:25:23.090 --> 08:25:23.100 align:start position:0%
it will be cheaper but there are a lot
 
08:25:24.650 --> 08:25:24.660 align:start position:0%
of factors involving the price of
 
08:25:27.350 --> 08:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
natural gas now and they're not all
 
08:25:33.010 --> 08:25:33.020 align:start position:0%
 
08:25:36.310 --> 08:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
I would remind members that in
 
08:25:42.048 --> 08:25:42.058 align:start position:0%
2019 or possibly 2020 one or the other
 
08:25:45.048 --> 08:25:45.058 align:start position:0%
a bill identical to this one passed both
 
08:25:47.208 --> 08:25:47.218 align:start position:0%
houses of the general court and was
 
08:25:49.730 --> 08:25:49.740 align:start position:0%
vetoed by the governor and his veto was
 
08:25:49.740 --> 08:25:51.468 align:start position:0%
vetoed by the governor and his veto was
sustained

08:25:51.468 --> 08:25:51.478 align:start position:0%
sustained
 
08:25:53.990 --> 08:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
any further representative Corman has a
 
08:25:54.000 --> 08:25:54.948 align:start position:0%
any further representative Corman has a
comment

08:25:54.948 --> 08:25:54.958 align:start position:0%
comment
 
08:25:58.010 --> 08:25:58.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so um I actually
 
08:26:00.170 --> 08:26:00.180 align:start position:0%
agree with what representative Bernardi
 
08:26:02.448 --> 08:26:02.458 align:start position:0%
said I agree with what representative
 
08:26:05.330 --> 08:26:05.340 align:start position:0%
Doug Thomas said I I am not saying that
 
08:26:08.330 --> 08:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
we should have zero natural gas what
 
08:26:09.948 --> 08:26:09.958 align:start position:0%
what I believe is that we want to reduce
 
08:26:12.830 --> 08:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
our natural gas and that if we reduce
 
08:26:15.530 --> 08:26:15.540 align:start position:0%
our demand of natural gas when demand
 
08:26:17.510 --> 08:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
goes down price goes down
 
08:26:20.570 --> 08:26:20.580 align:start position:0%
so you know I see incorporating
 
08:26:23.868 --> 08:26:23.878 align:start position:0%
renewable sources as not only good for
 
08:26:25.670 --> 08:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
the environment but actually good
 
08:26:27.948 --> 08:26:27.958 align:start position:0%
economically in terms of getting the
 
08:26:31.010 --> 08:26:31.020 align:start position:0%
demand for natural gas down and yes we
 
08:26:32.990 --> 08:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely need reliable sources I I
 
08:26:34.968 --> 08:26:34.978 align:start position:0%
agree and during those times that the
 
08:26:36.468 --> 08:26:36.478 align:start position:0%
wind is blowing so hard that the
 
08:26:38.330 --> 08:26:38.340 align:start position:0%
windmills won't work or the sun isn't
 
08:26:40.548 --> 08:26:40.558 align:start position:0%
shining yeah we need we need the other
 
08:26:42.410 --> 08:26:42.420 align:start position:0%
sources but during the times that the
 
08:26:45.110 --> 08:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
wind is friendly and and when the sun is
 
08:26:48.770 --> 08:26:48.780 align:start position:0%
is friendly let's Avail ourselves of
 
08:26:48.780 --> 08:26:52.270 align:start position:0%
is friendly let's Avail ourselves of
that

08:26:52.270 --> 08:26:52.280 align:start position:0%
 
08:26:55.190 --> 08:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
representative munz has another comment
 
08:26:56.868 --> 08:26:56.878 align:start position:0%
um I also agree with representative Doug
 
08:26:58.910 --> 08:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
Thomas I mean we do need both no no
 
08:27:00.468 --> 08:27:00.478 align:start position:0%
question about it
 
08:27:02.810 --> 08:27:02.820 align:start position:0%
um this bill will allow us
 
08:27:02.820 --> 08:27:04.070 align:start position:0%
um this bill will allow us
to

08:27:04.070 --> 08:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
08:27:06.888 --> 08:27:06.898 align:start position:0%
develop the alternative that we don't
 
08:27:10.490 --> 08:27:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
08:27:13.070 --> 08:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
and I also agree we need both
 
08:27:15.230 --> 08:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
but I will point out that everywhere
 
08:27:17.570 --> 08:27:17.580 align:start position:0%
it's been tried whether you're talking
 
08:27:19.190 --> 08:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
about California
 
08:27:19.200 --> 08:27:20.650 align:start position:0%
about California
Massachusetts

08:27:20.650 --> 08:27:20.660 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
08:27:25.368 --> 08:27:25.378 align:start position:0%
Germany the UK Spain
 
08:27:28.610 --> 08:27:28.620 align:start position:0%
renewable energy from wind and solar has
 
08:27:31.610 --> 08:27:31.620 align:start position:0%
proven to be more expensive has raised
 
08:27:35.750 --> 08:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
costs for electricity rate fares
 
08:27:35.760 --> 08:27:36.830 align:start position:0%
costs for electricity rate fares
and

08:27:36.830 --> 08:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
08:27:40.310 --> 08:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
in the absence of affordable and
 
08:27:42.730 --> 08:27:42.740 align:start position:0%
Deployable and scalable batteries
 
08:27:45.110 --> 08:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
renewable energy just isn't going to get
 
08:27:46.128 --> 08:27:46.138 align:start position:0%
us there
 
08:27:49.310 --> 08:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
and raising people's
 
08:27:51.830 --> 08:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire constituents electricity
 
08:27:56.570 --> 08:27:56.580 align:start position:0%
bills in a feudal attempt to get to a
 
08:28:00.048 --> 08:28:00.058 align:start position:0%
result that's not achievable
 
08:28:02.750 --> 08:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
is not something that my constituents
 
08:28:06.350 --> 08:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
08:28:10.128 --> 08:28:10.138 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on this issue
 
08:28:13.968 --> 08:28:13.978 align:start position:0%
yes representative spear a question is
 
08:28:17.030 --> 08:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
was I allowed to ask a question yes
 
08:28:18.888 --> 08:28:18.898 align:start position:0%
uh I've seen the numbers that you're
 
08:28:22.490 --> 08:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
talking about and one of the things that
 
08:28:25.070 --> 08:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
they that I have read in the news and in
 
08:28:26.530 --> 08:28:26.540 align:start position:0%
other articles that I've read on energy
 
08:28:28.850 --> 08:28:28.860 align:start position:0%
is that those numbers are going to come
 
08:28:32.150 --> 08:28:32.160 align:start position:0%
way down when those developments have
 
08:28:34.490 --> 08:28:34.500 align:start position:0%
been completed when the payoff on those
 
08:28:36.708 --> 08:28:36.718 align:start position:0%
developments have been completed they
 
08:28:39.230 --> 08:28:39.240 align:start position:0%
chose to spend the money up front get
 
08:28:41.448 --> 08:28:41.458 align:start position:0%
the development done and then after that
 
08:28:43.610 --> 08:28:43.620 align:start position:0%
it'll spread out so to say that it's
 
08:28:45.350 --> 08:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
going to cost that amount of money
 
08:28:47.750 --> 08:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
forever is not really what they're
 
08:28:49.368 --> 08:28:49.378 align:start position:0%
predicting they're predicting the cost
 
08:28:51.468 --> 08:28:51.478 align:start position:0%
are going to come down
 
08:28:53.448 --> 08:28:53.458 align:start position:0%
I was driving across the United States
 
08:28:56.810 --> 08:28:56.820 align:start position:0%
over the past year and I saw a
 
08:28:58.670 --> 08:28:58.680 align:start position:0%
staggering amount of farms with
 
08:29:00.770 --> 08:29:00.780 align:start position:0%
windmills in them so I looked up some of
 
08:29:03.650 --> 08:29:03.660 align:start position:0%
the numbers States like Nebraska is 70
 
08:29:06.230 --> 08:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
powered by wind
 
08:29:08.990 --> 08:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
Vermont is staggeringly I don't have the
 
08:29:10.490 --> 08:29:10.500 align:start position:0%
exact numbers for the month but they're
 
08:29:12.650 --> 08:29:12.660 align:start position:0%
more using uh
 
08:29:15.830 --> 08:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
what is it solar but we have windmills
 
08:29:17.930 --> 08:29:17.940 align:start position:0%
up in the older windmills up in the
 
08:29:19.730 --> 08:29:19.740 align:start position:0%
northern part of the state where the
 
08:29:21.948 --> 08:29:21.958 align:start position:0%
wind is very high and we just sell that
 
08:29:24.410 --> 08:29:24.420 align:start position:0%
power off to Vermont we sell that power
 
08:29:26.868 --> 08:29:26.878 align:start position:0%
off to Maine
 
08:29:29.330 --> 08:29:29.340 align:start position:0%
we don't seem to have a very good plan
 
08:29:32.388 --> 08:29:32.398 align:start position:0%
at all to catch up with anybody or to
 
08:29:35.090 --> 08:29:35.100 align:start position:0%
use the energy that we do generate
 
08:29:36.830 --> 08:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
that's my comment
 
08:29:38.388 --> 08:29:38.398 align:start position:0%
we sell that
 
08:29:40.730 --> 08:29:40.740 align:start position:0%
wind power to our neighboring states
 
08:29:42.048 --> 08:29:42.058 align:start position:0%
because we don't have transmission
 
08:29:44.510 --> 08:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
capability to bring it down here to New
 
08:29:44.520 --> 08:29:45.590 align:start position:0%
capability to bring it down here to New
Hampshire

08:29:45.590 --> 08:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
08:29:48.530 --> 08:29:48.540 align:start position:0%
so that's why we sell it but thank you
 
08:29:54.530 --> 08:29:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
08:29:58.190 --> 08:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
representative uh Carol Brown
 
08:30:00.530 --> 08:30:00.540 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair for letting me I
 
08:30:01.730 --> 08:30:01.740 align:start position:0%
promised I wasn't going to say anything
 
08:30:04.548 --> 08:30:04.558 align:start position:0%
to the assistant chair
 
08:30:06.948 --> 08:30:06.958 align:start position:0%
running for this office there were two
 
08:30:09.170 --> 08:30:09.180 align:start position:0%
things that people talk to me about the
 
08:30:10.730 --> 08:30:10.740 align:start position:0%
first one was abortion
 
08:30:12.888 --> 08:30:12.898 align:start position:0%
and the second one was the price of
 
08:30:15.468 --> 08:30:15.478 align:start position:0%
their energy in their home
 
08:30:18.048 --> 08:30:18.058 align:start position:0%
whatever we do here at the state
 
08:30:21.410 --> 08:30:21.420 align:start position:0%
we should not be making our our citizens
 
08:30:24.170 --> 08:30:24.180 align:start position:0%
rates go up for any reason they're
 
08:30:26.330 --> 08:30:26.340 align:start position:0%
already too high and the second thing is
 
08:30:28.788 --> 08:30:28.798 align:start position:0%
if we have any kind of rolling blackouts
 
08:30:30.770 --> 08:30:30.780 align:start position:0%
in this state and the legislature is
 
08:30:32.448 --> 08:30:32.458 align:start position:0%
responsible for that is completely
 
08:30:35.208 --> 08:30:35.218 align:start position:0%
unacceptable that we don't have an
 
08:30:37.430 --> 08:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
adequate supply of energy here
 
08:30:39.650 --> 08:30:39.660 align:start position:0%
so and to follow up on representative
 
08:30:41.448 --> 08:30:41.458 align:start position:0%
Bernardi I did some homework on this
 
08:30:42.948 --> 08:30:42.958 align:start position:0%
while I was running
 
08:30:45.350 --> 08:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
there's a wind farm in Alexandria and
 
08:30:45.360 --> 08:30:47.448 align:start position:0%
there's a wind farm in Alexandria and
Groton

08:30:47.448 --> 08:30:47.458 align:start position:0%
Groton
 
08:30:51.288 --> 08:30:51.298 align:start position:0%
um 25 uh 25 turbines I believe I talked
 
08:30:54.230 --> 08:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
to um the coastal wind representative
 
08:30:55.850 --> 08:30:55.860 align:start position:0%
from Department of energy whose Name
 
08:30:57.770 --> 08:30:57.780 align:start position:0%
Escapes me
 
08:31:01.010 --> 08:31:01.020 align:start position:0%
um and I I made some calls to ISO
 
08:31:03.048 --> 08:31:03.058 align:start position:0%
the capacity factor for those windmills
 
08:31:07.250 --> 08:31:07.260 align:start position:0%
is about 25 percent if I I'm doing this
 
08:31:08.750 --> 08:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
through memory
 
08:31:11.570 --> 08:31:11.580 align:start position:0%
that if you use those exact windmills to
 
08:31:13.070 --> 08:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
replace Schiller station or Newington
 
08:31:16.190 --> 08:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
station you need about 650 of them and
 
08:31:18.548 --> 08:31:18.558 align:start position:0%
that doesn't guarantee you power 24 7.
 
08:31:22.010 --> 08:31:22.020 align:start position:0%
we cannot I I this is one of the reasons
 
08:31:23.090 --> 08:31:23.100 align:start position:0%
I ran
 
08:31:24.770 --> 08:31:24.780 align:start position:0%
for the legislator is the cause of
 
08:31:27.888 --> 08:31:27.898 align:start position:0%
energy we cannot as legislators allow
 
08:31:29.750 --> 08:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
the citizens of this state not to have
 
08:31:33.468 --> 08:31:33.478 align:start position:0%
 
08:31:37.250 --> 08:31:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
08:31:41.930 --> 08:31:41.940 align:start position:0%
this uh representative McWilliams
 
08:31:43.430 --> 08:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to say that we're in a
 
08:31:45.350 --> 08:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
unique position and we've got some
 
08:31:47.208 --> 08:31:47.218 align:start position:0%
really exciting technology right where
 
08:31:48.410 --> 08:31:48.420 align:start position:0%
the science technology and energy
 
08:31:50.388 --> 08:31:50.398 align:start position:0%
committee got some really exciting
 
08:31:52.968 --> 08:31:52.978 align:start position:0%
technology coming with EV batteries to
 
08:31:54.770 --> 08:31:54.780 align:start position:0%
be able to go back into the Grid at
 
08:31:56.628 --> 08:31:56.638 align:start position:0%
periods when the sun isn't shining or
 
08:31:58.670 --> 08:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
the wind isn't blowing so it becomes
 
08:32:00.230 --> 08:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
sort of its own little micro grid for
 
08:32:01.490 --> 08:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
everyone who has an EV and they're
 
08:32:03.590 --> 08:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
plugging into the grid so this is coming
 
08:32:06.770 --> 08:32:06.780 align:start position:0%
it's becoming normalized I know we had a
 
08:32:10.090 --> 08:32:10.100 align:start position:0%
pilot at UNH and the co-op is currently
 
08:32:12.888 --> 08:32:12.898 align:start position:0%
working to make this part of their
 
08:32:14.930 --> 08:32:14.940 align:start position:0%
energy mix I expect that this will
 
08:32:16.490 --> 08:32:16.500 align:start position:0%
become mainstream in the next couple of
 
08:32:18.288 --> 08:32:18.298 align:start position:0%
years so I look forward to continuing
 
08:32:20.090 --> 08:32:20.100 align:start position:0%
this conversation with the members of
 
08:32:22.548 --> 08:32:22.558 align:start position:0%
stne as this evolves because I do think
 
08:32:24.530 --> 08:32:24.540 align:start position:0%
it's a very current subject and it's
 
08:32:26.750 --> 08:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
it's worth chatting about and I
 
08:32:28.250 --> 08:32:28.260 align:start position:0%
appreciate everybody being passionate
 
08:32:30.830 --> 08:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
about it so thank you all
 
08:32:33.288 --> 08:32:33.298 align:start position:0%
thank you well said uh representative
 
08:32:33.298 --> 08:32:34.610 align:start position:0%
thank you well said uh representative
McWilliams

08:32:34.610 --> 08:32:34.620 align:start position:0%
McWilliams
 
08:32:36.650 --> 08:32:36.660 align:start position:0%
so in an effort to get us out of here by
 
08:32:38.510 --> 08:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
six o'clock I'm going to call the vote
 
08:32:42.948 --> 08:32:42.958 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 418 the motion on the
 
08:32:46.968 --> 08:32:46.978 align:start position:0%
floor is itl and I uh asked the clerk to
 
08:32:49.548 --> 08:32:49.558 align:start position:0%
call the role on that question
 
08:32:51.230 --> 08:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
Doug Thomas
 
08:32:51.240 --> 08:32:52.490 align:start position:0%
Doug Thomas
yes

08:32:52.490 --> 08:32:52.500 align:start position:0%

Summers
 
08:33:09.898 --> 08:33:11.150 align:start position:0%
Summers
yes

08:33:11.150 --> 08:33:11.160 align:start position:0%
yes
 
08:33:15.170 --> 08:33:15.180 align:start position:0%
Rebecca McWilliams no
 
08:33:17.868 --> 08:33:17.878 align:start position:0%
Jessica Grill no
 
08:33:20.090 --> 08:33:20.100 align:start position:0%

Henry Noel
no

08:33:29.628 --> 08:33:29.638 align:start position:0%
no

Heath Howard no
 
08:33:41.270 --> 08:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
chairman Vose yes 10 10.
 
08:33:44.448 --> 08:33:44.458 align:start position:0%
so by a vote of 10 to 10 the motion to
 
08:33:48.948 --> 08:33:48.958 align:start position:0%
itl House Bill 418 fails the chair
 
08:33:52.490 --> 08:33:52.500 align:start position:0%
as uh makes the Judgment that an ought
 
08:33:55.250 --> 08:33:55.260 align:start position:0%
to pass motion will also fail
 
08:33:56.990 --> 08:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
so this bill will go to the house floor
 
08:33:59.868 --> 08:33:59.878 align:start position:0%
without recommendation the prevailing
 
08:34:02.208 --> 08:34:02.218 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor will be
 
08:34:04.548 --> 08:34:04.558 align:start position:0%
ought to pass representative McWilliams
 
08:34:06.590 --> 08:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
will you appoint someone to write the
 
08:34:08.570 --> 08:34:08.580 align:start position:0%
calendar report for that position
 
08:34:08.580 --> 08:34:11.110 align:start position:0%
calendar report for that position
absolutely

08:34:11.110 --> 08:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
08:34:13.310 --> 08:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
I'll let you know
 
08:34:16.270 --> 08:34:16.280 align:start position:0%
and representative notter will write the
 
08:34:20.810 --> 08:34:20.820 align:start position:0%
itl position calendar report
 
08:34:23.990 --> 08:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
and then we will be done so I'm going to
 
08:34:26.270 --> 08:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
close the executive session on House
 
08:34:28.910 --> 08:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
Bill 418.
 
08:34:31.610 --> 08:34:31.620 align:start position:0%
that leaves us with one task
 
08:34:33.830 --> 08:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
I'll open an executive session on House
 
08:34:36.468 --> 08:34:36.478 align:start position:0%
Bill 92 and recognize representative
 
08:34:38.628 --> 08:34:38.638 align:start position:0%
Doug Thomas
 
08:34:43.548 --> 08:34:43.558 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I move itl on hb92
 
08:34:46.250 --> 08:34:46.260 align:start position:0%
I'll speak to my motion right after the
 
08:34:46.260 --> 08:34:47.468 align:start position:0%
I'll speak to my motion right after the
second

08:34:47.468 --> 08:34:47.478 align:start position:0%
second
 
08:34:50.330 --> 08:34:50.340 align:start position:0%
representative nodder I second the
 
08:34:53.090 --> 08:34:53.100 align:start position:0%
motion it's been moved and seconded that
 
08:34:57.830 --> 08:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
we passed judgment on hb92 as itl
 
08:34:59.690 --> 08:34:59.700 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas
 
08:35:02.628 --> 08:35:02.638 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh Doug Thomas that
 
08:35:02.638 --> 08:35:03.708 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh Doug Thomas that
is

08:35:03.708 --> 08:35:03.718 align:start position:0%
is
 
08:35:06.350 --> 08:35:06.360 align:start position:0%
this bill has come before us before and
 
08:35:09.650 --> 08:35:09.660 align:start position:0%
for the same reasons I do itl the
 
08:35:12.170 --> 08:35:12.180 align:start position:0%
reasons are basically written right into
 
08:35:16.208 --> 08:35:16.218 align:start position:0%
the bill uh this bill
 
08:35:19.190 --> 08:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
mandates things that go against the free
 
08:35:19.200 --> 08:35:20.110 align:start position:0%
mandates things that go against the free
market

08:35:20.110 --> 08:35:20.120 align:start position:0%
market
 
08:35:24.288 --> 08:35:24.298 align:start position:0%
it eventually would require the state to
 
08:35:28.910 --> 08:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
not sell any gas powered light duty
 
08:35:32.388 --> 08:35:32.398 align:start position:0%
Vehicles meaning cars it it the it
 
08:35:35.150 --> 08:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
places a a hefty fine on manufacturers
 
08:35:38.330 --> 08:35:38.340 align:start position:0%
that don't meet the standards and the
 
08:35:41.510 --> 08:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
real uh thing that troubles me is that
 
08:35:44.510 --> 08:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
if New Hampshire were to adopt this bill
 
08:35:46.270 --> 08:35:46.280 align:start position:0%
we would be adopting California
 
08:35:50.510 --> 08:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
standards and any amendments that they
 
08:35:50.520 --> 08:35:51.548 align:start position:0%
standards and any amendments that they
make

08:35:51.548 --> 08:35:51.558 align:start position:0%
make
 
08:35:54.230 --> 08:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
afterwards we would be beholding to
 
08:35:57.530 --> 08:35:57.540 align:start position:0%
whatever California was to do on their
 
08:36:00.650 --> 08:36:00.660 align:start position:0%
standards which uh this is not the New
 
08:36:02.990 --> 08:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire way so these are all
 
08:36:05.330 --> 08:36:05.340 align:start position:0%
Troublesome to me it's an affront on the
 
08:36:10.190 --> 08:36:10.200 align:start position:0%
free market uh I believe that uh yeah I
 
08:36:12.708 --> 08:36:12.718 align:start position:0%
I know the intent is well the intent is
 
08:36:15.410 --> 08:36:15.420 align:start position:0%
to you know have more low emission
 
08:36:17.330 --> 08:36:17.340 align:start position:0%
vehicles and low emission vehicles to be
 
08:36:19.610 --> 08:36:19.620 align:start position:0%
sold in the state but I think the free
 
08:36:22.788 --> 08:36:22.798 align:start position:0%
market should should dictate that and so
 
08:36:24.968 --> 08:36:24.978 align:start position:0%
therefore for all those reasons and more
 
08:36:29.510 --> 08:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh we should I tell itl this bill
 
08:36:32.930 --> 08:36:32.940 align:start position:0%
further comment on hb92 representative
 
08:36:35.510 --> 08:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
notter thank you just a reminder that
 
08:36:39.110 --> 08:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
Des testified that they can't meet the
 
08:36:41.750 --> 08:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
date they just don't have enough time to
 
08:36:43.670 --> 08:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
put in rule making
 
08:36:46.310 --> 08:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
another thing to consider
 
08:36:47.930 --> 08:36:47.940 align:start position:0%
further comments on this bill
 
08:36:50.150 --> 08:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
representative Summers
 
08:36:53.208 --> 08:36:53.218 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I did a ton of
 
08:36:55.730 --> 08:36:55.740 align:start position:0%
research on this going everything from
 
08:36:59.208 --> 08:36:59.218 align:start position:0%
lithium mining into the down in the
 
08:37:02.990 --> 08:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
South America where 97 96 percent of all
 
08:37:05.868 --> 08:37:05.878 align:start position:0%
lithium is refined in China so basically
 
08:37:07.430 --> 08:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
we all used to complain everybody's
 
08:37:10.070 --> 08:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
complaining about dealing with OPEC and
 
08:37:12.230 --> 08:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
getting our oil from the Middle East so
 
08:37:13.368 --> 08:37:13.378 align:start position:0%
instead we're going to turn and we're
 
08:37:15.288 --> 08:37:15.298 align:start position:0%
going to get all of our lithium from
 
08:37:15.298 --> 08:37:16.250 align:start position:0%
going to get all of our lithium from
China

08:37:16.250 --> 08:37:16.260 align:start position:0%
China
 
08:37:18.708 --> 08:37:18.718 align:start position:0%
so then so we're depending 100 almost
 
08:37:21.288 --> 08:37:21.298 align:start position:0%
100 on China then I actually looked at
 
08:37:21.298 --> 08:37:22.190 align:start position:0%
100 on China then I actually looked at
the

08:37:22.190 --> 08:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
08:37:25.190 --> 08:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
the amount of pollution that comes from
 
08:37:28.548 --> 08:37:28.558 align:start position:0%
mining lithium and where you think
 
08:37:30.288 --> 08:37:30.298 align:start position:0%
there's a huge drastic difference
 
08:37:33.948 --> 08:37:33.958 align:start position:0%
between the electrical I mean the CO2
 
08:37:37.250 --> 08:37:37.260 align:start position:0%
emissions between the lithium electrical
 
08:37:40.730 --> 08:37:40.740 align:start position:0%
vehicle and the gas powered car
 
08:37:43.910 --> 08:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
just to build one Lithium powered
 
08:37:46.850 --> 08:37:46.860 align:start position:0%
battery powered electric car is 17
 
08:37:50.690 --> 08:37:50.700 align:start position:0%
megatons a CO2 was created for one car
 
08:37:55.208 --> 08:37:55.218 align:start position:0%
where a gas-powered car is around
 
08:37:59.868 --> 08:37:59.878 align:start position:0%
1.8 of that okay now over time the gas
 
08:38:01.750 --> 08:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
the gas power
 
08:38:05.510 --> 08:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
combustible engine runs it does it does
 
08:38:07.850 --> 08:38:07.860 align:start position:0%
surpass the amount of CO2 come out the
 
08:38:10.610 --> 08:38:10.620 align:start position:0%
electric car over a period of time but
 
08:38:13.310 --> 08:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
the amount of what's taken to strip mine
 
08:38:15.590 --> 08:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
lithium which is why lithium is not
 
08:38:17.208 --> 08:38:17.218 align:start position:0%
allowed to be mined in North America
 
08:38:20.570 --> 08:38:20.580 align:start position:0%
anymore and passed by President Biden to
 
08:38:22.850 --> 08:38:22.860 align:start position:0%
where it's actually not only not allowed
 
08:38:25.730 --> 08:38:25.740 align:start position:0%
in North America but we're only allowed
 
08:38:29.628 --> 08:38:29.638 align:start position:0%
to actually receive lithium from select
 
08:38:32.330 --> 08:38:32.340 align:start position:0%
countries because the bad practices not
 
08:38:35.090 --> 08:38:35.100 align:start position:0%
only of lithium but of the child Mining
 
08:38:36.650 --> 08:38:36.660 align:start position:0%
and child um
 
08:38:40.190 --> 08:38:40.200 align:start position:0%
production of cobalt in central Africa
 
08:38:42.288 --> 08:38:42.298 align:start position:0%
then when I look at the California code
 
08:38:44.208 --> 08:38:44.218 align:start position:0%
of regulations which is the what we
 
08:38:45.590 --> 08:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
would be adopting
 
08:38:48.170 --> 08:38:48.180 align:start position:0%
I know everybody talks about how it goes
 
08:38:50.810 --> 08:38:50.820 align:start position:0%
to 35 percent which means all vehicles
 
08:38:53.570 --> 08:38:53.580 align:start position:0%
on a car lot would be 35 percent had to
 
08:38:57.048 --> 08:38:57.058 align:start position:0%
be electrical by the year 2026 if we
 
08:38:59.150 --> 08:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
adopted this though by the end of next
 
08:39:01.430 --> 08:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
year what they leave out is is the
 
08:39:03.590 --> 08:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
current number is 25 percent that means
 
08:39:05.750 --> 08:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
25 percent of all electrical vehicles at
 
08:39:07.730 --> 08:39:07.740 align:start position:0%
every dealership across New Hampshire
 
08:39:10.548 --> 08:39:10.558 align:start position:0%
would have to be electrical now at the
 
08:39:13.128 --> 08:39:13.138 align:start position:0%
average price of sixty two thousand
 
08:39:15.230 --> 08:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
dollars per electric vehicle
 
08:39:17.690 --> 08:39:17.700 align:start position:0%
if you had how many dealerships could
 
08:39:20.690 --> 08:39:20.700 align:start position:0%
actually afford to make 25 of their
 
08:39:23.448 --> 08:39:23.458 align:start position:0%
dealership lot in all electrical at the
 
08:39:25.070 --> 08:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
average price of sixty two thousand
 
08:39:27.410 --> 08:39:27.420 align:start position:0%
dollars per car that's just some of the
 
08:39:28.670 --> 08:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
things in this we could go in a lot
 
08:39:29.750 --> 08:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
deeper but that's just what I've got
 
08:39:32.150 --> 08:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
right now thank you
 
08:39:34.368 --> 08:39:34.378 align:start position:0%
further comment on this legislation
 
08:39:36.708 --> 08:39:36.718 align:start position:0%
representative naughter we can add to
 
08:39:38.708 --> 08:39:38.718 align:start position:0%
that a lithium
 
08:39:40.968 --> 08:39:40.978 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle battery weighs a
 
08:39:42.770 --> 08:39:42.780 align:start position:0%
thousand pounds can take typically
 
08:39:46.010 --> 08:39:46.020 align:start position:0%
contains 25 pounds of lithium 30 pounds
 
08:39:49.190 --> 08:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
of Cobalt 60 pounds of nickel 110 pounds
 
08:39:51.888 --> 08:39:51.898 align:start position:0%
of graphite 90 pounds of copper 400
 
08:39:54.350 --> 08:39:54.360 align:start position:0%
pounds of steel aluminum and Plastics
 
08:39:56.628 --> 08:39:56.638 align:start position:0%
extraction from Earth and processing
 
08:39:58.910 --> 08:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
takes a lot to make one battery he went
 
08:40:00.430 --> 08:40:00.440 align:start position:0%
over all of that
 
08:40:03.110 --> 08:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
inner Mongolia has the most of the
 
08:40:05.750 --> 08:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
world's Rare Earth oars they pump acid
 
08:40:08.388 --> 08:40:08.398 align:start position:0%
into the ground the acid there's more
 
08:40:09.468 --> 08:40:09.478 align:start position:0%
chemicals that are used for the
 
08:40:12.048 --> 08:40:12.058 align:start position:0%
processing one ton of rare earth metals
 
08:40:14.930 --> 08:40:14.940 align:start position:0%
releases up to 420 000 cubic feet of
 
08:40:18.708 --> 08:40:18.718 align:start position:0%
toxic gases 2 600 cubic feet of acidic
 
08:40:20.510 --> 08:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
Wastewater and a ton of radioactive
 
08:40:23.330 --> 08:40:23.340 align:start position:0%
waste they are using children like you
 
08:40:24.410 --> 08:40:24.420 align:start position:0%
said and other people and they're
 
08:40:26.810 --> 08:40:26.820 align:start position:0%
suffering from skin and respiratory
 
08:40:29.030 --> 08:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
diseases I mean we could spend a very
 
08:40:31.610 --> 08:40:31.620 align:start position:0%
long time going over all of this it
 
08:40:33.708 --> 08:40:33.718 align:start position:0%
sounds so Rosy but it really it's not
 
08:40:36.770 --> 08:40:36.780 align:start position:0%
there's there's a lot to it
 
08:40:38.868 --> 08:40:38.878 align:start position:0%
that isn't good
 
08:40:41.330 --> 08:40:41.340 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bernardi has a
 
08:40:41.340 --> 08:40:42.170 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bernardi has a
comment

08:40:42.170 --> 08:40:42.180 align:start position:0%
comment
 
08:40:45.350 --> 08:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
just thank you Mr chairman uh so to
 
08:40:48.310 --> 08:40:48.320 align:start position:0%
quote the source uh Federal testimony
 
08:40:52.968 --> 08:40:52.978 align:start position:0%
observed uh in the in a hearing on this
 
08:40:57.350 --> 08:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
issue uh in in Congress uh the all the
 
08:41:00.010 --> 08:41:00.020 align:start position:0%
mining activities that you heard about
 
08:41:04.270 --> 08:41:04.280 align:start position:0%
lithium Cobalt and whatnot
 
08:41:07.610 --> 08:41:07.620 align:start position:0%
six times the amount of mining needing
 
08:41:09.288 --> 08:41:09.298 align:start position:0%
to be done
 
08:41:12.770 --> 08:41:12.780 align:start position:0%
strip mining as compared to making a
 
08:41:14.388 --> 08:41:14.398 align:start position:0%
standard car
 
08:41:17.750 --> 08:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
a huge environmental impact
 
08:41:20.330 --> 08:41:20.340 align:start position:0%
not done here so therefore it's okay
 
08:41:24.048 --> 08:41:24.058 align:start position:0%
supposedly I don't think so
 
08:41:27.048 --> 08:41:27.058 align:start position:0%
 
08:41:29.810 --> 08:41:29.820 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams
 
08:41:31.968 --> 08:41:31.978 align:start position:0%
thank you chair Vos I would like to
 
08:41:33.468 --> 08:41:33.478 align:start position:0%
commend all of my colleagues for your
 
08:41:35.448 --> 08:41:35.458 align:start position:0%
research on the environmental impacts of
 
08:41:37.968 --> 08:41:37.978 align:start position:0%
batteries and the rare earth minerals
 
08:41:40.368 --> 08:41:40.378 align:start position:0%
required to do batteries I do want to
 
08:41:41.868 --> 08:41:41.878 align:start position:0%
call your attention that this bill also
 
08:41:44.030 --> 08:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
enables hydrogen vehicles and other
 
08:41:46.368 --> 08:41:46.378 align:start position:0%
Innovative Vehicles not just EVS that
 
08:41:48.590 --> 08:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
run on batteries but really to get to
 
08:41:49.968 --> 08:41:49.978 align:start position:0%
the Crux of the discussion in the
 
08:41:52.788 --> 08:41:52.798 align:start position:0%
argument is we heard testimony and I
 
08:41:54.530 --> 08:41:54.540 align:start position:0%
certainly presented testimony that all
 
08:41:56.448 --> 08:41:56.458 align:start position:0%
of the major automobile manufacturers
 
08:41:59.030 --> 08:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
are going to electric vehicles either by
 
08:42:02.930 --> 08:42:02.940 align:start position:0%
2030 or 2040 so it's happening this is
 
08:42:04.430 --> 08:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
the direction of the future we're not
 
08:42:06.288 --> 08:42:06.298 align:start position:0%
suddenly going to change their minds or
 
08:42:08.510 --> 08:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
change their business practices here in
 
08:42:10.610 --> 08:42:10.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire by saying uh well you know
 
08:42:12.110 --> 08:42:12.120 align:start position:0%
we just disagree we'd like to stick with
 
08:42:13.430 --> 08:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
our combustion engines here in New
 
08:42:14.690 --> 08:42:14.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as long as we possibly can
 
08:42:16.430 --> 08:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
it's the way the future of the industry
 
08:42:19.128 --> 08:42:19.138 align:start position:0%
is going and so therefore we should be
 
08:42:21.888 --> 08:42:21.898 align:start position:0%
able to enable that and allow dealer
 
08:42:23.510 --> 08:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
Lots in New Hampshire to have these
 
08:42:26.208 --> 08:42:26.218 align:start position:0%
vehicles instead of prioritizing all the
 
08:42:28.128 --> 08:42:28.138 align:start position:0%
other states in the Northeast besides
 
08:42:30.590 --> 08:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we're the donut hole to
 
08:42:32.990 --> 08:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
receive zebs and loves zero missions and
 
08:42:35.628 --> 08:42:35.638 align:start position:0%
low emissions Vehicles because that is
 
08:42:37.788 --> 08:42:37.798 align:start position:0%
what is happening with the future now we
 
08:42:40.310 --> 08:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
did hear from uh the automotive Dealers
 
08:42:42.650 --> 08:42:42.660 align:start position:0%
Association that it is possible to get a
 
08:42:44.868 --> 08:42:44.878 align:start position:0%
Zev or Lev in New Hampshire uh you
 
08:42:46.070 --> 08:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
you're going to have long lead times
 
08:42:47.510 --> 08:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
you're going to wait a while it could be
 
08:42:49.490 --> 08:42:49.500 align:start position:0%
six to nine months maybe longer but it
 
08:42:51.888 --> 08:42:51.898 align:start position:0%
is possible but you know the reality is
 
08:42:53.570 --> 08:42:53.580 align:start position:0%
that's not the way people tend to
 
08:42:55.490 --> 08:42:55.500 align:start position:0%
purchase vehicles in New Hampshire they
 
08:42:56.868 --> 08:42:56.878 align:start position:0%
tend to say you know I think I want to
 
08:42:58.310 --> 08:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
get a new car I'm going to go test drive
 
08:43:00.350 --> 08:43:00.360 align:start position:0%
a couple vehicles and I'm going to buy
 
08:43:02.690 --> 08:43:02.700 align:start position:0%
something pretty soon they may not wait
 
08:43:05.090 --> 08:43:05.100 align:start position:0%
nine months or longer and so what what
 
08:43:08.628 --> 08:43:08.638 align:start position:0%
this bill attempted to do and I do have
 
08:43:11.810 --> 08:43:11.820 align:start position:0%
a amendment to it but but the underlying
 
08:43:14.570 --> 08:43:14.580 align:start position:0%
goal of this bill was to do was to get
 
08:43:16.610 --> 08:43:16.620 align:start position:0%
purchasers in New Hampshire the ability
 
08:43:19.190 --> 08:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
to buy their zebs and levs off of New
 
08:43:20.868 --> 08:43:20.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Lots in the normal manner that
 
08:43:22.850 --> 08:43:22.860 align:start position:0%
people purchase cars in New Hampshire
 
08:43:24.830 --> 08:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
but I do have an amendment working with
 
08:43:26.628 --> 08:43:26.638 align:start position:0%
the automotive Dealers Association to do
 
08:43:28.190 --> 08:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
a commission to look at Alternatives
 
08:43:30.770 --> 08:43:30.780 align:start position:0%
because I do hear my colleagues concerns
 
08:43:32.448 --> 08:43:32.458 align:start position:0%
about being tied to California
 
08:43:34.430 --> 08:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
amendments I think that that's a fair
 
08:43:36.830 --> 08:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
point and so if we could come up with a
 
08:43:38.990 --> 08:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
way to enable the transition to electric
 
08:43:40.788 --> 08:43:40.798 align:start position:0%
vehicles because that's really what's
 
08:43:43.070 --> 08:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
happening with the industry then I think
 
08:43:44.208 --> 08:43:44.218 align:start position:0%
we can come up with some really
 
08:43:45.888 --> 08:43:45.898 align:start position:0%
innovative solutions for New Hampshire
 
08:43:48.170 --> 08:43:48.180 align:start position:0%
rather than tying ourselves to somewhere
 
08:43:50.208 --> 08:43:50.218 align:start position:0%
else or something else this is the
 
08:43:51.530 --> 08:43:51.540 align:start position:0%
fourth time this committee has heard
 
08:43:52.850 --> 08:43:52.860 align:start position:0%
this bill and I think that there's
 
08:43:55.070 --> 08:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
something here it's worth working out
 
08:43:56.868 --> 08:43:56.878 align:start position:0%
and so for that reason I would ask for
 
08:43:59.090 --> 08:43:59.100 align:start position:0%
you to consider the amendment once this
 
08:44:01.750 --> 08:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
vote goes along party lines thank you
 
08:44:04.968 --> 08:44:04.978 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has a comment
 
08:44:07.128 --> 08:44:07.138 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
08:44:10.850 --> 08:44:10.860 align:start position:0%
um I I appreciate uh the the the the the
 
08:44:14.628 --> 08:44:14.638 align:start position:0%
efforts uh to to get something here for
 
08:44:18.288 --> 08:44:18.298 align:start position:0%
EVS but again I have to stress in the
 
08:44:21.350 --> 08:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
past you know when we were doing buggies
 
08:44:24.110 --> 08:44:24.120 align:start position:0%
and horses and the uh and the car came
 
08:44:26.208 --> 08:44:26.218 align:start position:0%
along it was the free market that
 
08:44:27.708 --> 08:44:27.718 align:start position:0%
demanded that we build the
 
08:44:29.810 --> 08:44:29.820 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and have cars built and
 
08:44:32.628 --> 08:44:32.638 align:start position:0%
so forth and and better and it was the
 
08:44:36.048 --> 08:44:36.058 align:start position:0%
free market that determined where we are
 
08:44:36.058 --> 08:44:37.150 align:start position:0%
free market that determined where we are
today

08:44:37.150 --> 08:44:37.160 align:start position:0%
today
 
08:44:40.190 --> 08:44:40.200 align:start position:0%
we should rely on the free market if
 
08:44:42.770 --> 08:44:42.780 align:start position:0%
people want to buy an electric vehicle
 
08:44:46.190 --> 08:44:46.200 align:start position:0%
they will and they have but I want to
 
08:44:48.048 --> 08:44:48.058 align:start position:0%
stress that some of the comments made
 
08:44:49.850 --> 08:44:49.860 align:start position:0%
here are
 
08:44:52.430 --> 08:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
in some ways built on some conjecture
 
08:44:55.128 --> 08:44:55.138 align:start position:0%
because we we say that it's going to
 
08:44:58.670 --> 08:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
happen we know it's going to happen no
 
08:45:00.530 --> 08:45:00.540 align:start position:0%
one knows what's going to happen in the
 
08:45:03.230 --> 08:45:03.240 align:start position:0%
future I mean in a few years a
 
08:45:05.750 --> 08:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
technology could change something could
 
08:45:08.948 --> 08:45:08.958 align:start position:0%
come up the the priorities might be
 
08:45:11.570 --> 08:45:11.580 align:start position:0%
diverted I know manufacturers are
 
08:45:13.070 --> 08:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
looking towards what they're doing by
 
08:45:15.590 --> 08:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
then and perhaps by then if that's what
 
08:45:16.968 --> 08:45:16.978 align:start position:0%
they're doing and that's what they're
 
08:45:19.190 --> 08:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
producing well that's the free market if
 
08:45:20.930 --> 08:45:20.940 align:start position:0%
they feel they can sell it they'll be
 
08:45:23.930 --> 08:45:23.940 align:start position:0%
able to sell it so I do believe that
 
08:45:26.388 --> 08:45:26.398 align:start position:0%
we're that in some cases we might be
 
08:45:29.090 --> 08:45:29.100 align:start position:0%
operating on information that we're only
 
08:45:31.128 --> 08:45:31.138 align:start position:0%
assuming is going to happen in the
 
08:45:32.990 --> 08:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
future that's kind of like conjunction
 
08:45:34.730 --> 08:45:34.740 align:start position:0%
so I think we should be very cautious
 
08:45:37.128 --> 08:45:37.138 align:start position:0%
and that not to
 
08:45:40.490 --> 08:45:40.500 align:start position:0%
bind ourselves to any mandates that will
 
08:45:42.530 --> 08:45:42.540 align:start position:0%
affect our citizens here I believe in
 
08:45:45.708 --> 08:45:45.718 align:start position:0%
the free market I believe that the
 
08:45:48.170 --> 08:45:48.180 align:start position:0%
people here will decide what dictates we
 
08:45:50.868 --> 08:45:50.878 align:start position:0%
have not a government mandate that ties
 
08:45:54.230 --> 08:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
us to a to a a place that's the opposite
 
08:45:56.330 --> 08:45:56.340 align:start position:0%
side of this country thank you
 
08:46:00.170 --> 08:46:00.180 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi has a comment
 
08:46:02.448 --> 08:46:02.458 align:start position:0%
s thank you Mr chairman uh building on
 
08:46:03.948 --> 08:46:03.958 align:start position:0%
what uh
 
08:46:06.830 --> 08:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas said I think
 
08:46:10.208 --> 08:46:10.218 align:start position:0%
many folks may remember when Coca-Cola
 
08:46:13.788 --> 08:46:13.798 align:start position:0%
launched New Coke it was going to it was
 
08:46:16.250 --> 08:46:16.260 align:start position:0%
going to be the new Coke it was going to
 
08:46:18.410 --> 08:46:18.420 align:start position:0%
be the coke that took off and everybody
 
08:46:18.420 --> 08:46:20.150 align:start position:0%
be the coke that took off and everybody
liked

08:46:20.150 --> 08:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
liked
 
08:46:24.350 --> 08:46:24.360 align:start position:0%
the market said no we don't like it
 
08:46:27.590 --> 08:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
bring back the original
 
08:46:30.888 --> 08:46:30.898 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter if GM and Ford and
 
08:46:33.410 --> 08:46:33.420 align:start position:0%
whoever say we are just going to produce
 
08:46:36.468 --> 08:46:36.478 align:start position:0%
EVS if they can't sell them because the
 
08:46:38.030 --> 08:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
market says
 
08:46:41.270 --> 08:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
I want my combustion-based vehicle then
 
08:46:43.310 --> 08:46:43.320 align:start position:0%
they're going to change their mind the
 
08:46:46.368 --> 08:46:46.378 align:start position:0%
market will drive what gets produced
 
08:46:46.378 --> 08:46:48.410 align:start position:0%
market will drive what gets produced
ultimately

08:46:48.410 --> 08:46:48.420 align:start position:0%
ultimately
 
08:46:50.990 --> 08:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
representative Nutter has a comment
 
08:46:53.030 --> 08:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
so during the hearing we could only ask
 
08:46:54.948 --> 08:46:54.958 align:start position:0%
questions and not make comments so I had
 
08:46:56.448 --> 08:46:56.458 align:start position:0%
written this down
 
08:46:58.310 --> 08:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
um all right my husband just got a
 
08:47:01.610 --> 08:47:01.620 align:start position:0%
bronco it's not an electric vehicle he
 
08:47:03.530 --> 08:47:03.540 align:start position:0%
ordered it in February he got it in
 
08:47:07.070 --> 08:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
October I recently traded in my car and
 
08:47:09.110 --> 08:47:09.120 align:start position:0%
I was actually very lucky that they had
 
08:47:11.270 --> 08:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
something on the lot they told me that
 
08:47:13.850 --> 08:47:13.860 align:start position:0%
they some typically they don't even have
 
08:47:15.288 --> 08:47:15.298 align:start position:0%
anything on the lot you have to wait
 
08:47:17.388 --> 08:47:17.398 align:start position:0%
wait until they get some in they'll get
 
08:47:19.250 --> 08:47:19.260 align:start position:0%
12 cars in they sell seven right away
 
08:47:21.708 --> 08:47:21.718 align:start position:0%
but I'm very blessed and very happy that
 
08:47:23.690 --> 08:47:23.700 align:start position:0%
I was able to trade in my race car for
 
08:47:26.868 --> 08:47:26.878 align:start position:0%
something that's more reasonable
 
08:47:29.628 --> 08:47:29.638 align:start position:0%
you had a race car
 
08:47:29.638 --> 08:47:31.690 align:start position:0%
you had a race car
wow

08:47:31.690 --> 08:47:31.700 align:start position:0%
wow
 
08:47:35.510 --> 08:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
representative Summers says Aquaman just
 
08:47:38.388 --> 08:47:38.398 align:start position:0%
a quick add-on to um I mean I'm and I
 
08:47:40.250 --> 08:47:40.260 align:start position:0%
I've actually heard positive things
 
08:47:42.170 --> 08:47:42.180 align:start position:0%
about hydrogen cars as they would come
 
08:47:42.180 --> 08:47:43.430 align:start position:0%
about hydrogen cars as they would come
along

08:47:43.430 --> 08:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
along
 
08:47:45.530 --> 08:47:45.540 align:start position:0%
um my worry mostly like I was talking
 
08:47:48.770 --> 08:47:48.780 align:start position:0%
about was lithium Cobalt and such and um
 
08:47:52.250 --> 08:47:52.260 align:start position:0%
where my concern right now and it's more
 
08:47:55.010 --> 08:47:55.020 align:start position:0%
of a New Hampshire thing is that our
 
08:47:57.170 --> 08:47:57.180 align:start position:0%
fire departments can't even deal right
 
08:47:59.690 --> 08:47:59.700 align:start position:0%
now with even a lithium battery I mean
 
08:48:02.330 --> 08:48:02.340 align:start position:0%
with a lithium car fire
 
08:48:04.190 --> 08:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
um I believe there was a wreck just a
 
08:48:07.128 --> 08:48:07.138 align:start position:0%
week 10 days ago I believe took 32 000
 
08:48:09.110 --> 08:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
gallons of water to put out one battery
 
08:48:11.570 --> 08:48:11.580 align:start position:0%
we don't have the foam to put out
 
08:48:13.490 --> 08:48:13.500 align:start position:0%
lithium batteries or because you have to
 
08:48:15.410 --> 08:48:15.420 align:start position:0%
cool them down they they burn from the
 
08:48:16.910 --> 08:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
inside so you have to cool them down to
 
08:48:18.650 --> 08:48:18.660 align:start position:0%
put the actually put the fire out so
 
08:48:19.850 --> 08:48:19.860 align:start position:0%
that's one thing I'm worried about the
 
08:48:23.090 --> 08:48:23.100 align:start position:0%
lithium is that and then also it's just
 
08:48:25.430 --> 08:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh as we know and many of you might have
 
08:48:29.110 --> 08:48:29.120 align:start position:0%
heard on the news today that in a small
 
08:48:32.090 --> 08:48:32.100 align:start position:0%
school up in Littleton today little to
 
08:48:34.310 --> 08:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire there was three classrooms
 
08:48:36.530 --> 08:48:36.540 align:start position:0%
that were burned all fire was all
 
08:48:39.288 --> 08:48:39.298 align:start position:0%
started by a lithium laptop battery well
 
08:48:42.468 --> 08:48:42.478 align:start position:0%
 
08:48:44.150 --> 08:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
representative love did you have a
 
08:48:46.788 --> 08:48:46.798 align:start position:0%
comment yes I do thank you Mr chair I
 
08:48:48.350 --> 08:48:48.360 align:start position:0%
want to thank everybody here for all the
 
08:48:50.030 --> 08:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
comments on all these bills it's been
 
08:48:52.310 --> 08:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
very interesting and uh been nice being
 
08:48:53.570 --> 08:48:53.580 align:start position:0%
a part of it
 
08:48:55.430 --> 08:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
um you know the the bottom line on all
 
08:48:57.230 --> 08:48:57.240 align:start position:0%
those green technology and green
 
08:48:59.448 --> 08:48:59.458 align:start position:0%
legislation and stuff is let's clean up
 
08:49:02.628 --> 08:49:02.638 align:start position:0%
the environment but at what cost
 
08:49:05.150 --> 08:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
um you know we we can't dictate what
 
08:49:07.070 --> 08:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
China does you know you heard about the
 
08:49:08.750 --> 08:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
mining and the mess that it's making of
 
08:49:10.368 --> 08:49:10.378 align:start position:0%
the environment over there that that
 
08:49:12.110 --> 08:49:12.120 align:start position:0%
that stuff comes into the air and gets
 
08:49:14.930 --> 08:49:14.940 align:start position:0%
blown this way we can't dictate that
 
08:49:17.388 --> 08:49:17.398 align:start position:0%
so if we're not going to be able to
 
08:49:20.090 --> 08:49:20.100 align:start position:0%
dictate to one of the major polluters in
 
08:49:22.010 --> 08:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
this world
 
08:49:23.990 --> 08:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
um what is little New Hampshire going to
 
08:49:26.570 --> 08:49:26.580 align:start position:0%
do why are we going to burden our people
 
08:49:30.048 --> 08:49:30.058 align:start position:0%
with excess excess electricity cost uh
 
08:49:33.770 --> 08:49:33.780 align:start position:0%
heating costs uh Transportation costs uh
 
08:49:33.780 --> 08:49:34.548 align:start position:0%
heating costs uh Transportation costs uh
it

08:49:34.548 --> 08:49:34.558 align:start position:0%
it
 
08:49:35.750 --> 08:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
um that's something something I'm not
 
08:49:37.610 --> 08:49:37.620 align:start position:0%
going to do to my constituents and that
 
08:49:39.288 --> 08:49:39.298 align:start position:0%
is doing something to them
 
08:49:41.208 --> 08:49:41.218 align:start position:0%
not for them we're doing something to

yes I'm sure 10 10.
 
08:51:11.638 --> 08:51:12.830 align:start position:0%
yes I'm sure 10 10.
no

08:51:12.830 --> 08:51:12.840 align:start position:0%
no
 
08:51:12.840 --> 08:51:16.548 align:start position:0%
no
no

08:51:16.548 --> 08:51:16.558 align:start position:0%
 
08:51:19.368 --> 08:51:19.378 align:start position:0%
 
08:51:24.170 --> 08:51:24.180 align:start position:0%
no she said no she followed
 
08:51:26.868 --> 08:51:26.878 align:start position:0%
all right by a vote of 10 to 10 the
 
08:51:29.090 --> 08:51:29.100 align:start position:0%
motion to itl fails
 
08:51:31.730 --> 08:51:31.740 align:start position:0%
the chair rules that emotion to uh to
 
08:51:33.770 --> 08:51:33.780 align:start position:0%
pass would also fails so this bill will
 
08:51:34.910 --> 08:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
go to
 
08:51:37.910 --> 08:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
the floor without recommendation
 
08:51:40.368 --> 08:51:40.378 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams
 
08:51:42.770 --> 08:51:42.780 align:start position:0%
I'd like to make a motion to adopt an
 
08:51:48.288 --> 08:51:48.298 align:start position:0%
 
08:51:52.430 --> 08:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
08:51:54.350 --> 08:51:54.360 align:start position:0%
the amendment would require an ought to
 
08:51:56.930 --> 08:51:56.940 align:start position:0%
pass motion I don't think that
 
08:51:59.570 --> 08:51:59.580 align:start position:0%
that motion would be
 
08:52:02.868 --> 08:52:02.878 align:start position:0%
um appropriate so I don't think we need
 
08:52:04.670 --> 08:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
to consider an amendment on this bill I
 
08:52:05.868 --> 08:52:05.878 align:start position:0%
think we need to send it to the house
 
08:52:08.628 --> 08:52:08.638 align:start position:0%
floor without recommendation
 
08:52:11.448 --> 08:52:11.458 align:start position:0%
with a report from
 
08:52:13.788 --> 08:52:13.798 align:start position:0%
you representative McWilliams or or
 
08:52:16.190 --> 08:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
someone that you designate
 
08:52:20.388 --> 08:52:20.398 align:start position:0%
for the ought to pass motion and
 
08:52:22.850 --> 08:52:22.860 align:start position:0%
our side will
 
08:52:25.430 --> 08:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
send a calendar report for the itl
 
08:52:25.440 --> 08:52:27.468 align:start position:0%
send a calendar report for the itl
motion

08:52:27.468 --> 08:52:27.478 align:start position:0%
motion
 
08:52:29.330 --> 08:52:29.340 align:start position:0%
I would challenge the chairs ruling on
 
08:52:31.730 --> 08:52:31.740 align:start position:0%
that I I believe we should be allowed to
 
08:52:34.368 --> 08:52:34.378 align:start position:0%
make an amendment an OTP with Amendment
 
08:52:36.350 --> 08:52:36.360 align:start position:0%
motion if none of the other motions have
 
08:52:36.360 --> 08:52:37.430 align:start position:0%
motion if none of the other motions have
carried

08:52:37.430 --> 08:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
carried
 
08:52:40.730 --> 08:52:40.740 align:start position:0%
okay the representative McWilliams has
 
08:52:42.288 --> 08:52:42.298 align:start position:0%
challenged the rule of the chair on the
 
08:52:43.968 --> 08:52:43.978 align:start position:0%
question of whether there should be a
 
08:52:47.570 --> 08:52:47.580 align:start position:0%
motion of ought to pass
 
08:52:49.490 --> 08:52:49.500 align:start position:0%
the only way to resolve a challenge to
 
08:52:51.048 --> 08:52:51.058 align:start position:0%
the chair is to ask for a vote of the
 
08:52:51.058 --> 08:52:52.250 align:start position:0%
the chair is to ask for a vote of the
committee

08:52:52.250 --> 08:52:52.260 align:start position:0%
committee
 
08:52:56.150 --> 08:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
so I asked the clerk to call the role on
 
08:52:58.128 --> 08:52:58.138 align:start position:0%
the question of
 
08:53:01.730 --> 08:53:01.740 align:start position:0%
the challenge to the chair
 
08:53:04.070 --> 08:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
on the question of
 
08:53:06.590 --> 08:53:06.600 align:start position:0%
point of order ruling not to accept
 
08:53:09.468 --> 08:53:09.478 align:start position:0%
emotion of to pass
 
08:53:11.628 --> 08:53:11.638 align:start position:0%
point of order point of order what is
 
08:53:14.330 --> 08:53:14.340 align:start position:0%
your point of order point of inquiry
 
08:53:17.388 --> 08:53:17.398 align:start position:0%
would it it would it be appropriate or
 
08:53:20.570 --> 08:53:20.580 align:start position:0%
or is it possible to at least describe
 
08:53:24.830 --> 08:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
the amendment before we go any further
 
08:53:26.868 --> 08:53:26.878 align:start position:0%
well we have a challenge on the floor we
 
08:53:28.548 --> 08:53:28.558 align:start position:0%
have to resolve that first but the
 
08:53:30.948 --> 08:53:30.958 align:start position:0%
challenge is based on on people not
 
08:53:32.990 --> 08:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
understanding what the amendment is that
 
08:53:37.610 --> 08:53:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
08:53:40.070 --> 08:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
okay representative McWilliams tell us
 
08:53:41.868 --> 08:53:41.878 align:start position:0%
what the amendment is
 
08:53:43.610 --> 08:53:43.620 align:start position:0%
thank you chavos
 
08:53:45.048 --> 08:53:45.058 align:start position:0%
um this amendment is really
 
08:53:46.430 --> 08:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
straightforward and simple
 
08:53:48.530 --> 08:53:48.540 align:start position:0%
it's a commission
 
08:53:50.448 --> 08:53:50.458 align:start position:0%
with five members of the House of
 
08:53:52.430 --> 08:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
Representatives one member of the Senate
 
08:53:53.750 --> 08:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of the Department of
 
08:53:55.548 --> 08:53:55.558 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services or designee
 
08:53:57.170 --> 08:53:57.180 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of energy
 
08:53:59.330 --> 08:53:59.340 align:start position:0%
or designee Commissioner of Department
 
08:54:01.250 --> 08:54:01.260 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services or designee
 
08:54:03.350 --> 08:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
member of the northeast states for
 
08:54:05.270 --> 08:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
coordinated air use management appointed
 
08:54:06.468 --> 08:54:06.478 align:start position:0%
by the executive director of that
 
08:54:08.330 --> 08:54:08.340 align:start position:0%
organization a member of the New
 
08:54:09.948 --> 08:54:09.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Automotive Dealers Association
 
08:54:12.350 --> 08:54:12.360 align:start position:0%
appointed by that Association and a
 
08:54:13.850 --> 08:54:13.860 align:start position:0%
member of the automotive manufacturer
 
08:54:15.170 --> 08:54:15.180 align:start position:0%
Association appointed by that
 
08:54:17.808 --> 08:54:17.818 align:start position:0%
Association charged with coming up with
 
08:54:20.448 --> 08:54:20.458 align:start position:0%
a way to study uh Innovative vehicle
 
08:54:22.128 --> 08:54:22.138 align:start position:0%
emission standards and electric vehicles
 
08:54:23.330 --> 08:54:23.340 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
08:54:25.190 --> 08:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
that's the commission
 
08:54:27.948 --> 08:54:27.958 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that description
 
08:54:29.808 --> 08:54:29.818 align:start position:0%
so the speaker of the house and the
 
08:54:31.850 --> 08:54:31.860 align:start position:0%
president of the Senate have both
 
08:54:34.750 --> 08:54:34.760 align:start position:0%
communicated to members of their
 
08:54:37.128 --> 08:54:37.138 align:start position:0%
respective caucuses
 
08:54:40.490 --> 08:54:40.500 align:start position:0%
that they discourage the
 
08:54:43.368 --> 08:54:43.378 align:start position:0%
passage of bills to create committees
 
08:54:45.530 --> 08:54:45.540 align:start position:0%
and commissions
 
08:54:48.230 --> 08:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
in the most in the strongest of possible
 
08:54:48.240 --> 08:54:50.030 align:start position:0%
in the most in the strongest of possible
terms

08:54:50.030 --> 08:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
terms
 
08:54:52.368 --> 08:54:52.378 align:start position:0%
the reason for that is we already have
 
08:54:55.730 --> 08:54:55.740 align:start position:0%
some 400 committees and commissions and
 
08:54:57.770 --> 08:54:57.780 align:start position:0%
both the speaker and the
 
08:55:00.110 --> 08:55:00.120 align:start position:0%
Senate President struggled to find
 
08:55:02.808 --> 08:55:02.818 align:start position:0%
members to appoint to all these
 
08:55:05.570 --> 08:55:05.580 align:start position:0%
committees and commissions
 
08:55:09.288 --> 08:55:09.298 align:start position:0%
so I have ruled that this amendment
 
08:55:12.288 --> 08:55:12.298 align:start position:0%
isn't worth taking up because of
 
08:55:16.010 --> 08:55:16.020 align:start position:0%
instructions I've received from house
 
08:55:18.708 --> 08:55:18.718 align:start position:0%
leadership that we want to discourage
 
08:55:20.628 --> 08:55:20.638 align:start position:0%
the creation of committees and
 
08:55:20.638 --> 08:55:22.208 align:start position:0%
the creation of committees and
commissions

08:55:22.208 --> 08:55:22.218 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
08:55:25.308 --> 08:55:25.318 align:start position:0%
that does not leave unresolved the
 
08:55:26.868 --> 08:55:26.878 align:start position:0%
matter on the floor which is the
 
08:55:29.628 --> 08:55:29.638 align:start position:0%
challenge to the ruling of the chair
 
08:55:32.270 --> 08:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
so I'll ask the clerk to call the roll
 
08:55:33.850 --> 08:55:33.860 align:start position:0%
on the question
 
08:55:37.490 --> 08:55:37.500 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas I think you're for
 
08:55:40.368 --> 08:55:40.378 align:start position:0%
uh uh it might be a point of order uh
 
08:55:43.190 --> 08:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
just for clarification uh what's the
 
08:55:45.288 --> 08:55:45.298 align:start position:0%
most what are we what is the motion that
 
08:55:49.070 --> 08:55:49.080 align:start position:0%
we are voting on uh whether we do or do
 
08:55:51.830 --> 08:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
not agree with the challenge to the
 
08:55:53.570 --> 08:55:53.580 align:start position:0%
chair how how are you freezing the
 
08:55:53.580 --> 08:55:55.448 align:start position:0%
chair how how are you freezing the
motion

08:55:55.448 --> 08:55:55.458 align:start position:0%
motion
 
08:55:58.128 --> 08:55:58.138 align:start position:0%
if we vote Yes what does that mean or if
 
08:56:00.888 --> 08:56:00.898 align:start position:0%
we if we vote no what does that mean
 
08:56:04.030 --> 08:56:04.040 align:start position:0%
so representative McWilliams challenged
 
08:56:06.770 --> 08:56:06.780 align:start position:0%
my ruling that we're not going to
 
08:56:09.350 --> 08:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
consider this amendment
 
08:56:10.910 --> 08:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
if you vote
 
08:56:15.288 --> 08:56:15.298 align:start position:0%
yes then you accept her Challenge and
 
08:56:19.730 --> 08:56:19.740 align:start position:0%
and say yes we want to overrule the the
 
08:56:21.170 --> 08:56:21.180 align:start position:0%
rule of the chair
 
08:56:24.650 --> 08:56:24.660 align:start position:0%
if you vote no then you let the rule of
 
08:56:27.170 --> 08:56:27.180 align:start position:0%
the chair stand
 
08:56:29.270 --> 08:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
is everybody clear on that
 
08:56:32.628 --> 08:56:32.638 align:start position:0%
a yes vote overrules the rule of the
 
08:56:34.610 --> 08:56:34.620 align:start position:0%
chair and means we'll sit here for
 
08:56:36.410 --> 08:56:36.420 align:start position:0%
another half hour debating this
 
08:56:36.420 --> 08:56:38.930 align:start position:0%
another half hour debating this
amendment

08:56:38.930 --> 08:56:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
08:56:42.170 --> 08:56:42.180 align:start position:0%
if you vote no then that the ruling of
 
08:56:44.448 --> 08:56:44.458 align:start position:0%
the chair will stand and what we we will
 
08:56:47.090 --> 08:56:47.100 align:start position:0%
not go forward with this amendment
 
08:56:49.490 --> 08:56:49.500 align:start position:0%
