New Hampshire represent Penza would you
 
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 align:start position:0%

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
us here I believe representative weary
 
00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:51.639 align:start position:0%
is coming I'm not sure uh I know
 
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
representative eel cannot be here there
 
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 align:start position:0%
was a
 
00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
conflict um if someone could uh send
 
00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:02.479 align:start position:0%
represent wary a message to ask uh if if
 
00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:04.039 align:start position:0%
he is on thank you already thank you
 
00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
represent beler um I actually left my um
 
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
phone in the car
 
00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360 align:start position:0%
so uh but today we're going to be going
 
00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
over um a report um I guess the easiest
 
00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 align:start position:0%
thing to do would be to look at The
 
00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:22.919 align:start position:0%
Minority Report report first um seen as
 
00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
that is the shortest of the reports and
 
00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 align:start position:0%
uh if anyone would just like to take a
 
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
look at that uh representative
 
00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you madam chair and I just
 
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to thank the uh Democratic
 
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for presenting
 
00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:41.919 align:start position:0%
their Minority Report and I would say
 
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:44.360 align:start position:0%
that I have read it I
 
00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
see personally no problem with um with
 
00:06:50.589 --> 00:06:50.599 align:start position:0%
including the Minority Report um except
 
00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:52.919 align:start position:0%
minus the attachment of the AAR because
 
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
that's already a part of the committee's
 
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
permanent record and it would make our
 
00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
report like double the current length
 
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
any other comments uh would everyone
 
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
like a few minutes to read
 
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
it okay we'll take a couple minutes just
 
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:58.430 align:start position:0%
 
it

00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:28.430 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:58.430 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:08:58.430 --> 00:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:28.350 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:28.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:59.710 --> 00:09:59.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:02.069 --> 00:10:02.079 align:start position:0%
has everyone had a chance to review it
 
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:06.040 align:start position:0%
and are there any comments represent PO
 
00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.670 align:start position:0%
and are there any comments represent PO
is

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:11.829 --> 00:10:11.839 align:start position:0%
off just asking is it just one page
 
00:10:11.839 --> 00:10:12.949 align:start position:0%
off just asking is it just one page
because

00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:12.959 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
uh uh there is one word on the second
 
00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:18.680 align:start position:0%
page States covid response and then the
 
00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:20.360 align:start position:0%
rest was the title and then they had the
 
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
after action report attached to it which
 
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
I didn't feel like I didn't want to
 
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:26.200 align:start position:0%
print out that entire report because
 
00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:28.760 align:start position:0%
it's also referenced in our documents so
 
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:38.920 align:start position:0%
anyways right correct and the sentence I
 
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
can read you what the sentence said if
 
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
see do you have that up
 
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
Mike represent
 
00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:54.680 align:start position:0%
vure if not I have it here I'll just get
 
00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
it done I am pulling up right now it
 
00:11:00.629 --> 00:11:00.639 align:start position:0%
should be here any second
 
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
would you like me to read the last page
 
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
here yes please um so I'll start with
 
00:11:07.509 --> 00:11:07.519 align:start position:0%
the sentence it was on the Democratic
 
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
members do not agree with many of the
 
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
assertions findings and recommendations
 
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
in the report with respect to the
 
00:11:14.069 --> 00:11:14.079 align:start position:0%
efficacy of the state's covid response
 
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
for this reason respectfully the
 
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
Democratic members of the committee do
 
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
not concur with the Republican committee
 
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
members report uh respectfully submitted
 
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
signed uh all five uh Democratic members
 
00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:29.320 align:start position:0%
of the committee uh the date um goes on
 
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
on to the attachments from
 
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
there thank you represent P
 
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
off yeah yeah I can is representative
 
00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:41.240 align:start position:0%
Bela that I don't see a problem with
 
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
including uh this two pages the only
 
00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:47.519 align:start position:0%
thing I noticed that in the fourth
 
00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:51.519 align:start position:0%
paragraph there's a little inconsistency
 
00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
how they call uh the states covid-19
 
00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
after Action Report like sometimes they
 
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
call it
 
00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
abbreviation ARR and sometimes they call
 
00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
it uh the report but it's a small thing
 
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
uh so overall I I don't have a problem
 
00:12:15.949 --> 00:12:15.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
it like if you go
 
00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
to the second uh Fifth Line from the
 
00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
bottom it says uh a
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
RR but uh
 
00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
in in the first line of that paragraph
 
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
they say they they will call it just a
 
00:12:39.069 --> 00:12:39.079 align:start position:0%
report I see what you're saying so
 
00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
basically what they should have done is
 
00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:44.120 align:start position:0%
after that um thereafter called a
 
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:46.040 align:start position:0%
somewhere so that people would be able
 
00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
to reference that so it should go like
 
00:12:48.639 --> 00:12:50.790 align:start position:0%
to reference that so it should go like
this

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
correct um right because they put in
 
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
parenes the report but it should be uh a
 
00:13:00.389 --> 00:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
a um and then report also
 
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
correct um so it' be a minor uh edit and
 
00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:06.959 align:start position:0%
I don't it would not alter the
 
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:09.800 align:start position:0%
composition of the statement it would
 
00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:11.240 align:start position:0%
just be an
 
00:13:14.269 --> 00:13:14.279 align:start position:0%
English uh grammatical
 
00:13:14.279 --> 00:13:19.470 align:start position:0%
English uh grammatical
correction

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:19.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:23.389 --> 00:13:23.399 align:start position:0%
um I also think that I think with the
 
00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:26.240 align:start position:0%
covid-19 after action
 
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
report it says that it was rep prepared
 
00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
by an independent consultant for the
 
00:13:36.069 --> 00:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
state um it was prepared but it was
 
00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
prepared for Homeland Security it was
 
00:13:38.399 --> 00:13:39.750 align:start position:0%
prepared for Homeland Security it was
not

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.269 align:start position:0%
not
prepared

00:13:42.269 --> 00:13:42.279 align:start position:0%
prepared
 
00:13:45.069 --> 00:13:45.079 align:start position:0%
um and I believe it was at the request
 
00:13:47.189 --> 00:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
of Homeland Security and I think it's
 
00:13:49.269 --> 00:13:49.279 align:start position:0%
important to include who requested that
 
00:13:52.629 --> 00:13:52.639 align:start position:0%
report um that's just my thoughts but
 
00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
it's probably just splicing hairs at
 
00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.710 align:start position:0%
it's probably just splicing hairs at
this

00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:57.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
Penza yeah I wanted to bring that up
 
00:14:06.829 --> 00:14:06.839 align:start position:0%
piece too
 
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:10.720 align:start position:0%
um uh let's see right here which was
 
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
prepared by an independent consultant
 
00:14:13.389 --> 00:14:13.399 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:16.240 align:start position:0%
state I think that's a little um I think
 
00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:19.480 align:start position:0%
that's a little broad-based only because
 
00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:22.120 align:start position:0%
um I believe that this was in a sense
 
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
mandated by the executive this report
 
00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
and um whoever was hired was by the
 
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
executive and so um I didn't see um all
 
00:14:38.069 --> 00:14:38.079 align:start position:0%
of the entities uh being put into place
 
00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:41.000 align:start position:0%
like where was the public component um
 
00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:43.240 align:start position:0%
there there really wasn't um all of the
 
00:14:46.189 --> 00:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
people that were affected by this so I
 
00:14:48.509 --> 00:14:48.519 align:start position:0%
don't really understand how necessarily
 
00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
independent it was if it was hired by
 
00:14:53.949 --> 00:14:53.959 align:start position:0%
they were hired by the executive branch
 
00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:56.680 align:start position:0%
and we're really only looking at um you
 
00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:13.240 align:start position:0%
comments represent po
 
00:15:16.509 --> 00:15:16.519 align:start position:0%
off no comments for Minority Report but
 
00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
I will have some comments about coming
 
00:15:19.199 --> 00:15:21.829 align:start position:0%
I will have some comments about coming
majority

00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:21.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
report if everyone's okay with the
 
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
Minority Report we'll place that aside
 
00:15:29.949 --> 00:15:29.959 align:start position:0%
and we'll move on to the majority report
 
00:15:29.959 --> 00:15:35.110 align:start position:0%
and we'll move on to the majority report
okay

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.749 align:start position:0%
 
please

00:15:36.749 --> 00:15:36.759 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:15:39.949 --> 00:15:39.959 align:start position:0%
um I have to thank uh representative uh
 
00:15:39.959 --> 00:15:41.509 align:start position:0%
um I have to thank uh representative uh
beler

00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:41.519 align:start position:0%
beler
 
00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:44.600 align:start position:0%
and representative
 
00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.389 align:start position:0%
and representative
weary

00:15:46.389 --> 00:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
weary
 
00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
um for uh put pulling this together and
 
00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:51.720 align:start position:0%
spending numerous
 
00:15:55.629 --> 00:15:55.639 align:start position:0%
hours um on this report and and putting
 
00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
you know getting it together um I think
 
00:16:01.069 --> 00:16:01.079 align:start position:0%
it's important uh for us to go over uh a
 
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
little section by section um just so
 
00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:08.519 align:start position:0%
everyone understands uh where we're at
 
00:16:12.189 --> 00:16:12.199 align:start position:0%
um also included and um our researcher
 
00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
Kristen Grant did a great job um on
 
00:16:17.949 --> 00:16:17.959 align:start position:0%
there's an addendum that I printed out
 
00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
um single page uh listing um the dates
 
00:16:25.829 --> 00:16:25.839 align:start position:0%
of all of our meetings who testified and
 
00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:27.720 align:start position:0%
uh she is now going through to make sure
 
00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:29.480 align:start position:0%
that all partent documents m mentation
 
00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:35.000 align:start position:0%
is um uploaded into our website um so
 
00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
that anything that is referenced here
 
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
can be referenced uh pointed to the
 
00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
website which I think is extremely
 
00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:44.600 align:start position:0%
important um there is
 
00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
one um item that wasn't uh posted I
 
00:16:50.389 --> 00:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
think because the file was too big and I
 
00:16:52.629 --> 00:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
don't know if representative Bela had a
 
00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
chance to ex um extrapolate any of it
 
00:16:59.389 --> 00:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
from RZA um her
 
00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
information was pretty uh it was a very
 
00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:07.880 align:start position:0%
large file um but uh if you'd like to
 
00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
speak to that represent Bela uh I I
 
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
apologize I missed the beginning of that
 
00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:13.880 align:start position:0%
can you ask uh repeat the question uh
 
00:17:16.669 --> 00:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
yes so we're just going over how
 
00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:20.120 align:start position:0%
um uh our researcher Christen Grant uh
 
00:17:21.669 --> 00:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
pulled together all the committee
 
00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:23.720 align:start position:0%
hearings who testified before each
 
00:17:26.549 --> 00:17:26.559 align:start position:0%
committee on each date and she's now
 
00:17:29.669 --> 00:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
going through all the files of
 
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
um to upload them into our website so
 
00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
that we can reference them in the report
 
00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
um and I was saying that re's file was
 
00:17:42.549 --> 00:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
pretty enormous um and therefore uh
 
00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
there isn't anything in there and I
 
00:17:46.029 --> 00:17:46.039 align:start position:0%
didn't know if you had extrapolated
 
00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:48.520 align:start position:0%
anything out of that report um that
 
00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
uploaded uh thank you so there there
 
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
were not a lot of direct references in
 
00:17:58.830 --> 00:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
the report there was paraphrasing and
 
00:17:59.789 --> 00:17:59.799 align:start position:0%
and various things so I don't think
 
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
there was anything that was that would
 
00:18:02.789 --> 00:18:02.799 align:start position:0%
have been pulled directly from there
 
00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
requiring a citation of of that nature
 
00:18:08.149 --> 00:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
but we can certainly add to the report a
 
00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
um a hyperlink to the permanent record
 
00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:13.549 align:start position:0%
um a hyperlink to the permanent record
um

00:18:13.549 --> 00:18:13.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:17.549 --> 00:18:17.559 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um I was suggesting that
 
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
we uh go over this uh session by section
 
00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
by section uh obviously we have an
 
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
introduction in the mission uh it's uh
 
00:18:28.029 --> 00:18:28.039 align:start position:0%
ver verbatim basically from what I just
 
00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:29.960 align:start position:0%
read this morning
 
00:18:32.669 --> 00:18:32.679 align:start position:0%
um talked about um how many meetings
 
00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
we've had how many hours of public
 
00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
hearings and
 
00:18:39.909 --> 00:18:39.919 align:start position:0%
documents um and who was on the
 
00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
committee do anyone have any issues with
 
00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.149 align:start position:0%
committee do anyone have any issues with
that

00:18:44.149 --> 00:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:46.799 align:start position:0%
particular section should probably be
 
00:18:51.149 --> 00:18:51.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
with seeing none moving
 
00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
on um so
 
00:18:59.390 --> 00:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
acknowledgements um
 
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
this year we we we took the time because
 
00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
we realized that we were in a
 
00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:05.750 align:start position:0%
we realized that we were in a
pandemic

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
and it was of unknown precedence and we
 
00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
were trying to make sure uh there were a
 
00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:14.039 align:start position:0%
lot of people involved trying to keep
 
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
everyone safe and we know the first
 
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
couple of weeks uh few weeks um you know
 
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
who is it for us to you know these
 
00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:24.799 align:start position:0%
people were working around the clock
 
00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
trying to do the best for New Hampshire
 
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
and we just wanted to recognize uh and
 
00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
we know that we're doing this after the
 
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
fact so it's easy for us to um we need
 
00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
to be careful because you know we're the
 
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
Monday morning uh quarterback right um
 
00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
but we wanted to thank everyone who came
 
00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
before our committee who testified we
 
00:19:48.549 --> 00:19:48.559 align:start position:0%
want to thank all the agencies who
 
00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
participated and all the people involved
 
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
we know that businesses and individuals
 
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
sacrificed a lot during this time and um
 
00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:01.880 align:start position:0%
we need to be cognizant of that and I
 
00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:03.880 align:start position:0%
think that was where the acknowledgement
 
00:20:05.909 --> 00:20:05.919 align:start position:0%
came in does anyone have any issues with
 
00:20:05.919 --> 00:20:12.390 align:start position:0%
came in does anyone have any issues with
that

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:16.029 --> 00:20:16.039 align:start position:0%
section summary of findings uh does
 
00:20:18.149 --> 00:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
anyone have had a chance to look at that
 
00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:43.720 align:start position:0%

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
will have enough time to also get the
 
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
the list of uh documents that we
 
00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
submitted or uh links uh and documents
 
00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:21.240 align:start position:0%

including as a amendment to report uh
 
00:21:28.149 --> 00:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
the full list of uh uh what documents
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:44.200 align:start position:0%
represent po off yeah I'm fine with the
 
00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:46.520 align:start position:0%

the acknowledgements okay uh we're now
 
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
represent po
 
00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
off uh I have a question to
 
00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:33.400 align:start position:0%
representative TS so uh we are including
 
00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:37.480 align:start position:0%
Minority Report as it is uh but for the
 
00:23:41.029 --> 00:23:41.039 align:start position:0%
benefit of public uh at the end you
 
00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:44.360 align:start position:0%
write that you don't agree with our
 
00:23:47.269 --> 00:23:47.279 align:start position:0%
conclusions so as as we go through
 
00:23:51.269 --> 00:23:51.279 align:start position:0%
report uh if you could uh clarify to the
 
00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
public like which specific conclusions
 
00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
minority do not agree with I think it
 
00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
would be uh benef icial for people
 
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
watching our committee uh to know like
 
00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
where we have
 
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
disagreements um thank you for the uh
 
00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:11.960 align:start position:0%
request I I apologize I'm not prepared
 
00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:13.480 align:start position:0%
to do that my understanding was we were
 
00:24:16.149 --> 00:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
just voting to accept the report um not
 
00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
to go through it section by section the
 
00:24:21.549 --> 00:24:21.559 align:start position:0%
committee as a whole all with different
 
00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
members input into reviewing this and
 
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
into drafting the um you know the
 
00:24:30.269 --> 00:24:30.279 align:start position:0%
minority report so you're not going to
 
00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:31.640 align:start position:0%
revise the report the report's the
 
00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
report but I understand you're going
 
00:24:35.149 --> 00:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
through it for making sure everyone
 
00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
understands what's
 
00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
there uh thank you for that uh
 
00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:41.549 align:start position:0%
there uh thank you for that uh
representative

00:24:41.549 --> 00:24:41.559 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
Penza um I I appreciate the question
 
00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:47.960 align:start position:0%
from um um from
 
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
representative come on polo polo off
 
00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
there we go um so but I I wanted to just
 
00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:55.960 align:start position:0%
follow up with what you said it would be
 
00:24:58.510 --> 00:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
I think it would be helpful um for all
 
00:25:00.789 --> 00:25:00.799 align:start position:0%
the time and um and energy that
 
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
everybody's put into it especially even
 
00:25:04.549 --> 00:25:04.559 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of people in the public
 
00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:07.960 align:start position:0%
that have been watching this and um in
 
00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:10.360 align:start position:0%
in listening to testimony and all of
 
00:25:14.269 --> 00:25:14.279 align:start position:0%
that to give maybe a bullet point from
 
00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:16.840 align:start position:0%
um the minority side which basically
 
00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
gives specifics about what you don't
 
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
agree with so if that could happen that
 
00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
would be great it doesn't necessarily uh
 
00:25:24.669 --> 00:25:24.679 align:start position:0%
have to happen today but that would be
 
00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
helpful for all the members of the
 
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
committee to put together specific
 
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
specifically what is not agreed on yeah
 
00:25:32.669 --> 00:25:32.679 align:start position:0%
I don't know that I can commit to that I
 
00:25:35.669 --> 00:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
can make sure everyone is aware we we
 
00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
crafted a a uh a report that enumerated
 
00:25:44.669 --> 00:25:44.679 align:start position:0%
certain points uh so that's all I can
 
00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:47.320 align:start position:0%
say would it be helpful for me to read
 
00:25:50.149 --> 00:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
The Minority Report out loud so everyone
 
00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
can understand what's in it or do we we
 
00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:55.240 align:start position:0%
all understand what they have said uh
 
00:25:57.389 --> 00:25:57.399 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher thank you madam chair
 
00:25:59.590 --> 00:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
I I don't know that that's it necessary
 
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
I think that the report does I mean
 
00:26:03.549 --> 00:26:03.559 align:start position:0%
obviously a couple issues were
 
00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
highlighted but I think the report seems
 
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
to represent the view of the minority
 
00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
reasonably well and um I think it's
 
00:26:14.269 --> 00:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
clear enough uh what what they're trying
 
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
to get um across with the report and for
 
00:26:21.789 --> 00:26:21.799 align:start position:0%
consideration I've added sections to the
 
00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
larger report to include this already if
 
00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about that later we can add
 
00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:29.440 align:start position:0%
it and whatnot thank you okay wonderful
 
00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
thank you okay um so we are on the
 
00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
summary of findings everyone was fine
 
00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:36.190 align:start position:0%
summary of findings everyone was fine
with

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:36.200 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
acknowledgements um is there anything
 
00:26:43.549 --> 00:26:43.559 align:start position:0%
you know uh we in here I think it's
 
00:26:45.029 --> 00:26:45.039 align:start position:0%
important to note that the committee
 
00:26:47.909 --> 00:26:47.919 align:start position:0%
identified three primary objectives halt
 
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
the transmission of the virus and
 
00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
prevent it be from becoming an emic
 
00:26:53.909 --> 00:26:53.919 align:start position:0%
mitigate transmission to prevent the
 
00:26:55.389 --> 00:26:55.399 align:start position:0%
Health Care system and infrastructure
 
00:26:57.789 --> 00:26:57.799 align:start position:0%
from being overwhelmed and reduce a
 
00:26:58.990 --> 00:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
long-term term transmission and
 
00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
mortality rates of the virus through
 
00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
therapeutic measures um were the three
 
00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
uh primary objectives that were
 
00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:12.440 align:start position:0%
identified here um and as The Minority
 
00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
Report did State
 
00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:17.720 align:start position:0%
um this was an
 
00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
overwhelming uh
 
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
task uh an enormous task um and I think
 
00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
we only scratched the surface um to put
 
00:27:32.909 --> 00:27:32.919 align:start position:0%
it uh bluntly um there are many more
 
00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
areas that dealt with the pandemic that
 
00:27:40.389 --> 00:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
we haven't even uh gotten to um and
 
00:27:42.549 --> 00:27:42.559 align:start position:0%
responses and why they were handled
 
00:27:45.269 --> 00:27:45.279 align:start position:0%
certain ways um in different
 
00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
departments um so there is um I think
 
00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
for the time that we
 
00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:56.360 align:start position:0%
had we did a uh we did the best that we
 
00:27:58.750 --> 00:27:58.760 align:start position:0%
could but I think there's still a more
 
00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:01.640 align:start position:0%
that's needed in my personal opinion
 
00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:03.430 align:start position:0%
that's needed in my personal opinion
representative

00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
weary uh thank you madam chair I'd like
 
00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
to just Echo upon what you said because
 
00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
I think what we're finding out um in
 
00:28:13.909 --> 00:28:13.919 align:start position:0%
terms of safety and efficacy profiles
 
00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
for some of the therapeutic areas as
 
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
well as the consequences of other um for
 
00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
lack of a better summary term mandates
 
00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
um those are having longer term effects
 
00:28:30.029 --> 00:28:30.039 align:start position:0%
that were just now beginning to more
 
00:28:32.909 --> 00:28:32.919 align:start position:0%
fully understand so I think the
 
00:28:32.919 --> 00:28:34.430 align:start position:0%
fully understand so I think the
opportunity

00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
to to Really re-evaluate what was done
 
00:28:42.909 --> 00:28:42.919 align:start position:0%
um again without playing you know Monday
 
00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
Morning Quarterback or without uh being
 
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
uh you know opportunistic and taking a
 
00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:52.760 align:start position:0%
hindsight look at things but I
 
00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:55.240 align:start position:0%
nonetheless I think it's still important
 
00:28:58.350 --> 00:28:58.360 align:start position:0%
that we we understand the full I think
 
00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:01.240 align:start position:0%
we fully understand the full impact yet
 
00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:04.799 align:start position:0%
of what was done and because of that I
 
00:29:08.389 --> 00:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
think um there is there is further
 
00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
inquiry that needs to be
 
00:29:12.269 --> 00:29:12.279 align:start position:0%
performed thank you for that
 
00:29:14.269 --> 00:29:14.279 align:start position:0%
representative beler thank you madam
 
00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:17.000 align:start position:0%
chair and and per the um feelings of
 
00:29:19.269 --> 00:29:19.279 align:start position:0%
certain members of this committee I have
 
00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
taken the liberty of um typing up just a
 
00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
brief section for conclusion that might
 
00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:26.200 align:start position:0%
be added to the end if we decide to and
 
00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
I'll read that if you don't mind
 
00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:30.200 align:start position:0%
this committee has spent considerable
 
00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
time reviewing the events of the past
 
00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
several years with regards to the
 
00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:35.640 align:start position:0%
state's response to the pandemic
 
00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:37.240 align:start position:0%
receiving testimony and documents and
 
00:29:39.029 --> 00:29:39.039 align:start position:0%
making recommendations for the future to
 
00:29:41.669 --> 00:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
the benefit of this state however very
 
00:29:44.549 --> 00:29:44.559 align:start position:0%
much remains to be reviewed assessed and
 
00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
many more recommendations are likely
 
00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
that result likely to result as a
 
00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
consequence because of this the
 
00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:53.320 align:start position:0%
committee recommends and concludes that
 
00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
our work is not yet concluded with the
 
00:29:58.149 --> 00:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
issuance of this report and recommends
 
00:30:00.269 --> 00:30:00.279 align:start position:0%
that consideration be given that this
 
00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:02.440 align:start position:0%
committee be reinstated in the new house
 
00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
session of 2025 to 2026 to continue
 
00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:07.640 align:start position:0%
toward these ends and to the benefit of
 
00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:30:11.029 --> 00:30:11.039 align:start position:0%
citizens uh for reference purposes I've
 
00:30:12.509 --> 00:30:12.519 align:start position:0%
also included a link to our permanent
 
00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
conclusion uh does anyone have anything
 
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
they like to say about what
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
representative beler just wrote um
 
00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
thoughts representative
 
00:30:34.389 --> 00:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
weary yeah I I would concur I think that
 
00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
that follows along with the comment I
 
00:30:38.549 --> 00:30:38.559 align:start position:0%
made earlier I do
 
00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:42.440 align:start position:0%
think um it it's been very helpful to
 
00:30:44.149 --> 00:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
this committee to
 
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
get um testimony from a number of
 
00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
different sources I don't think we've
 
00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:54.760 align:start position:0%
honestly scratched the surface of public
 
00:30:56.950 --> 00:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
testimony however I mean I I think we've
 
00:31:00.669 --> 00:31:00.679 align:start position:0%
had the benefit of of of a number of you
 
00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
know key sort of scientific
 
00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:06.200 align:start position:0%
Witnesses um especially those from the
 
00:31:10.389 --> 00:31:10.399 align:start position:0%
state have been very helpful um but I
 
00:31:13.149 --> 00:31:13.159 align:start position:0%
think I think
 
00:31:16.389 --> 00:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
um to to be able to obtain much more
 
00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:19.480 align:start position:0%
public testimony would give I think
 
00:31:21.669 --> 00:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
government officials a better sense of
 
00:31:26.629 --> 00:31:26.639 align:start position:0%
the true impact of of what um the
 
00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:30.200 align:start position:0%
response had on the public so that would
 
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
be my
 
00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:34.200 align:start position:0%
comment anybody
 
00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
else um I think um I agree I also think
 
00:31:42.029 --> 00:31:42.039 align:start position:0%
that the mission may need to be amended
 
00:31:44.669 --> 00:31:44.679 align:start position:0%
just a little bit
 
00:31:50.149 --> 00:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
um because with um and as our uh steam
 
00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
colleague represent Merchant spoke about
 
00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:55.000 align:start position:0%
uh long Co is a real thing that we need
 
00:31:58.110 --> 00:31:58.120 align:start position:0%
to be looking at and it is the result of
 
00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
the emergency use authorization and so I
 
00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
think we also need to be for
 
00:32:05.549 --> 00:32:05.559 align:start position:0%
forward-looking um in this committee
 
00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
also not just looking um at what
 
00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:11.720 align:start position:0%
happened which is extremely important
 
00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:13.880 align:start position:0%
because it is affecting what's going
 
00:32:17.149 --> 00:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
going forward um but looking at things
 
00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
like long cover uh Speech disabilities
 
00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
uh and the young children that were
 
00:32:24.909 --> 00:32:24.919 align:start position:0%
masked um where we have now a shortage
 
00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
of speech
 
00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
pathologist um and things like that um
 
00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure representative beler if
 
00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:36.440 align:start position:0%
there's a way to um make a statement in
 
00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
there about kind of amending the mission
 
00:32:41.149 --> 00:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
just a tad um so that we can be
 
00:32:41.159 --> 00:32:44.389 align:start position:0%
just a tad um so that we can be
forward-looking

00:32:44.389 --> 00:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:47.789 --> 00:32:47.799 align:start position:0%
also thank you m chair I will uh begin
 
00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
thinking about that and how that might
 
00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:53.720 align:start position:0%
happen thank you all right back to the
 
00:32:53.720 --> 00:33:00.029 align:start position:0%
happen thank you all right back to the
report

00:33:00.029 --> 00:33:00.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:03.269 --> 00:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
uh anyone have any concerns with uh we
 
00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:08.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
five uh please representative
 
00:33:16.389 --> 00:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
Penza so if we are to just like make a
 
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
couple word changes or something like
 
00:33:20.029 --> 00:33:20.039 align:start position:0%
that what what is the process can that
 
00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
be done today and then um and then this
 
00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:26.200 align:start position:0%
get submitted or can it's right because
 
00:33:28.509 --> 00:33:28.519 align:start position:0%
they're minor like like on The Minority
 
00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:31.000 align:start position:0%
Report you know just putting the a so it
 
00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:33.880 align:start position:0%
references it so that it's consistent
 
00:33:36.149 --> 00:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
within the paragraph I think those are
 
00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
minor edits uh would you agree it's
 
00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
right okay and I would be uh happy to
 
00:33:47.629 --> 00:33:47.639 align:start position:0%
hear those but yes so so we're going
 
00:33:49.269 --> 00:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
through we're not going to substantially
 
00:33:53.149 --> 00:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
change the report but we want this to be
 
00:33:56.509 --> 00:33:56.519 align:start position:0%
the best that we can do so uh any typos
 
00:33:58.430 --> 00:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
or editing or things like that I think
 
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
this is an important time to do that
 
00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
okay so what do you
 
00:34:06.789 --> 00:34:06.799 align:start position:0%
have um please yes so just uh paragraph
 
00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:07.960 align:start position:0%
on page
 
00:34:11.829 --> 00:34:11.839 align:start position:0%
five um underneath um so it would be
 
00:34:16.990 --> 00:34:17.000 align:start position:0%
paragraph one two three it says in some
 
00:34:18.669 --> 00:34:18.679 align:start position:0%
cases New Hampshire simply follow the
 
00:34:21.069 --> 00:34:21.079 align:start position:0%
federal guidance I would change that in
 
00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:31.629 --> 00:34:31.639 align:start position:0%
apologies what page was that uh page
 
00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:33.710 align:start position:0%
apologies what page was that uh page
five

00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:33.720 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:34:37.950 --> 00:34:37.960 align:start position:0%
um the first paragraph under the uh
 
00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
objectives last
 
00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
sentence where it says in some cases she
 
00:34:44.589 --> 00:34:44.599 align:start position:0%
would like to change that in most
 
00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
cases is how does the committee feel
 
00:34:54.349 --> 00:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
change represent PO is off Sly I can not
 
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
find it uh could you help me
 
00:35:05.349 --> 00:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
um okay is it one of the three
 
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
objectives no it's the paragraph
 
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
underneath that and it would be in the
 
00:35:12.349 --> 00:35:12.359 align:start position:0%
last sentence of that next paragraph So
 
00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
the represent
 
00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
Belcher I I like the the idea of
 
00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:25.240 align:start position:0%
changing it I don't know that I like the
 
00:35:27.829 --> 00:35:27.839 align:start position:0%
specific word most because that's a
 
00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
that's a quantifiable number more than
 
00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
not and I don't know 100% that we can
 
00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
say it but I would like to see a change
 
00:35:37.829 --> 00:35:37.839 align:start position:0%
perhaps to many cases if that would be
 
00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
acceptable I I I if we're going to
 
00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:43.400 align:start position:0%
change it I think many is better than
 
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
most because we have no evidence that
 
00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
most cases but we do understand that
 
00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:51.800 align:start position:0%
from the people that testified many of
 
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
the guidances came down from the federal
 
00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
uh represent weary then represent Penza
 
00:35:58.829 --> 00:35:58.839 align:start position:0%
that was certainly true with what our uh
 
00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
State epidemiologist said and so I think
 
00:36:04.069 --> 00:36:04.079 align:start position:0%
um in terms of following the guidance so
 
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
I think that's that's a good suggestion
 
00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.230 align:start position:0%
I think that's that's a good suggestion
which

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:11.480 align:start position:0%
one many or most many is the preferred
 
00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:13.400 align:start position:0%
one but I I like the suggestion of
 
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
changing it from some to something that
 
00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
is more indicative of the majority or
 
00:36:23.109 --> 00:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
you know much more of the federal
 
00:36:25.109 --> 00:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
guidance being used than just than just
 
00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
represent Venza yeah I'd be if everybody
 
00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:33.160 align:start position:0%
wants Ben that's fine the reason why I
 
00:36:36.109 --> 00:36:36.119 align:start position:0%
say most is because I I follow that so I
 
00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:37.720 align:start position:0%
I look at just if I look at the press
 
00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:40.440 align:start position:0%
conferences alone which were probably
 
00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:43.400 align:start position:0%
more than a hundred um every single time
 
00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:45.640 align:start position:0%
there was a press conference it was
 
00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:48.680 align:start position:0%
always referenced whether it was federal
 
00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:52.280 align:start position:0%
or CDC guidelines every single time so
 
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
um based upon every press conference
 
00:36:56.109 --> 00:36:56.119 align:start position:0%
every single time Lori shonet was
 
00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
speaking every single time Dr Chan was
 
00:37:00.829 --> 00:37:00.839 align:start position:0%
speaking it was always referenced to
 
00:37:03.309 --> 00:37:03.319 align:start position:0%
federal guidelines so that's why I say
 
00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
that's why I say most we can use many
 
00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:08.920 align:start position:0%
I'm fine with either okay I I think
 
00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:11.240 align:start position:0%
um I understand where you're coming from
 
00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
with the word most but I think many um I
 
00:37:18.829 --> 00:37:18.839 align:start position:0%
think would be more representative
 
00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:21.560 align:start position:0%
um it's something that we don't have to
 
00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
quantify here and represent beler thank
 
00:37:26.829 --> 00:37:26.839 align:start position:0%
you madam chair I would EO that as well
 
00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:29.000 align:start position:0%
I I think think honestly the the member
 
00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
is correct that it is most I just don't
 
00:37:37.069 --> 00:37:37.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
so uh so that will be in some cases will
 
00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
be changed to in many cases perfect any
 
00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
other uh comments on page
 
00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
represent beler perhaps funny that I'm
 
00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
going to recommend a change having
 
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
written much of this but in paragraph
 
00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:52.720 align:start position:0%
two um it says call was made for two
 
00:38:54.069 --> 00:38:54.079 align:start position:0%
weeks flatten curve and this directive
 
00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
led to widespread closures business
 
00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
closures General prohibition um at this
 
00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
juncture the previous guidance and
 
00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
recommendations for mask being worn in
 
00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
public and social distancing became
 
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
mandates I might just add something to
 
00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
the effective at this juncture the
 
00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:13.160 align:start position:0%
previous guidance to not wear
 
00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
masks was
 
00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:24.069 --> 00:39:24.079 align:start position:0%
yeah okay go
 
00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
represent yeah there's a there's kind of
 
00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
like a sentence Miss in here
 
00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
because at the time as if we can all
 
00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
remember at the two weeks to flatten the
 
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
curve and all of that piece there was
 
00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:40.760 align:start position:0%
uh it wasn't at that point you know
 
00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of conflicting guidance
 
00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:47.240 align:start position:0%
and really the The Mask you know kind of
 
00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:48.760 align:start position:0%
you know if you want to call it mandate
 
00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
stuff was really more taking place later
 
00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
after that like it started to come in I
 
00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
would say because March is when
 
00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
everything happened happened um that was
 
00:40:00.829 --> 00:40:00.839 align:start position:0%
coming in actually towards the summer
 
00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:03.160 align:start position:0%
and definitely of course as we can all
 
00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:05.640 align:start position:0%
recall when kids were going back to
 
00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
school in um the ones that were open um
 
00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
kids that were going back to school in
 
00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
September so if if we can all remember
 
00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:16.520 align:start position:0%
that so yeah there's a piece here um
 
00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:18.280 align:start position:0%
because there really wasn't any previous
 
00:40:22.069 --> 00:40:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
point represent pull is off yeah I agree
 
00:40:28.349 --> 00:40:28.359 align:start position:0%
with this change and
 
00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
I think the previous guidance was like
 
00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
very telling uh we don't have time to go
 
00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
on it but uh it was like in my point of
 
00:40:40.829 --> 00:40:40.839 align:start position:0%
view when when government believed that
 
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
masks might help the government told
 
00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
people don't use masks because allegedly
 
00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
they were trying to save PPE for doctors
 
00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
only so they were misinforming public
 
00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
that but but later when in my point of
 
00:40:59.790 --> 00:40:59.800 align:start position:0%
VI we already had data that masks don't
 
00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
stop transmission then they started to
 
00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
saying use masks because they wanted
 
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
like to tell people that pandemic should
 
00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:09.880 align:start position:0%
be treated seriously so it was more like
 
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
social construct so I think this change
 
00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
will better show the picture of what was
 
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.109 align:start position:0%
will better show the picture of what was
going

00:41:18.109 --> 00:41:18.119 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:23.800 align:start position:0%
on uh represent Bel could you uh read
 
00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:26.680 align:start position:0%
from uh the call was made for two weeks
 
00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
just so we
 
00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
we have continuity and with the change
 
00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
it yes Madam chair um the call was made
 
00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:36.200 align:start position:0%
for two weeks of flatten the curve and
 
00:41:38.069 --> 00:41:38.079 align:start position:0%
this directive led to widespread school
 
00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:40.200 align:start position:0%
closures business closures General
 
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
prohibitions on Gatherings um EG
 
00:41:46.309 --> 00:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
religious activities Civic meetings Etc
 
00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:48.680 align:start position:0%
at this juncture the previous guidance
 
00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:51.400 align:start position:0%
to not utilize masks to medovate the
 
00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
virus was reversed and soon thereafter
 
00:41:56.349 --> 00:41:56.359 align:start position:0%
social distancing and masking became
 
00:41:56.359 --> 00:41:59.829 align:start position:0%
social distancing and masking became
mandates

00:41:59.829 --> 00:41:59.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:59.839 --> 00:42:01.109 align:start position:0%
 
any

00:42:01.109 --> 00:42:01.119 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:04.640 align:start position:0%
objectives to this okay thank you all
 
00:42:23.950 --> 00:42:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
six I'm just going to State um
 
00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:31.480 align:start position:0%
on page seven we call the after Action
 
00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:34.280 align:start position:0%
Report the executive after action report
 
00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:37.240 align:start position:0%
and over here the co the covid-19 after
 
00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:39.640 align:start position:0%
action report I think we should be
 
00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:41.640 align:start position:0%
consistent between the minority and the
 
00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
majority report and it is called the
 
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
covid-19 after action report so that um
 
00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:49.480 align:start position:0%
so it should be the same throughout if
 
00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:52.040 align:start position:0%
you don't mind representative beler
 
00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:53.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:42:57.549 --> 00:42:57.559 align:start position:0%
yes I'll revise ours to just say a a to
 
00:42:59.589 --> 00:42:59.599 align:start position:0%
be consistent with how you referred to
 
00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
it okay thank you but we can review our
 
00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:06.510 align:start position:0%
it okay thank you but we can review our
edits

00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:06.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:09.640 align:start position:0%
after represent Penza so basically every
 
00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
time in um so in The Minority Report and
 
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
then in the majority report um it should
 
00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
say the exact title which is the
 
00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:22.640 align:start position:0%
covid-19 after Action Report the first
 
00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
time that it's mentioned and then in
 
00:43:28.829 --> 00:43:28.839 align:start position:0%
parenthesis put AA R and then it can be
 
00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
referenced to just a a afterwards so
 
00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:41.109 --> 00:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
correct represent beler thank you madam
 
00:43:43.069 --> 00:43:43.079 align:start position:0%
chair so I've made that change it reads

beginning on page seven the covid-19
 
00:43:49.109 --> 00:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
after action report a a commissioned by
 
00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
the executive likewise makes it clear
 
00:43:53.589 --> 00:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
that the healthcare system was not
 
00:43:55.710 --> 00:43:55.720 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed thank
 
00:43:58.390 --> 00:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
you so did make that you changed that
 
00:44:05.589 --> 00:44:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:29.520 align:start position:0%

I've just made a brief find in replace
 
00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
change that at all instances of
 
00:44:48.349 --> 00:44:48.359 align:start position:0%
references the covid-19 are utilizing
 
00:44:50.829 --> 00:44:50.839 align:start position:0%
all capital letters um if that's
 
00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:52.520 align:start position:0%
preferred just to keep it consistent
 
00:44:55.309 --> 00:44:55.319 align:start position:0%
through the document okay thank
 
00:44:57.910 --> 00:44:57.920 align:start position:0%

00:45:25.309 --> 00:45:25.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:28.589 --> 00:45:28.599 align:start position:0%
eight um on page
 
00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
eight third paragraph down first
 
00:45:38.589 --> 00:45:38.599 align:start position:0%
line um it just doesn't sound right to
 
00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:41.800 align:start position:0%
me yes that's a mistake
 
00:45:58.510 --> 00:45:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
if I may uh please just a okay Quick
 
00:46:05.549 --> 00:46:05.559 align:start position:0%
Change uh to read instead lastly this
 
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
committee has examined and analyzed the
 
00:46:09.829 --> 00:46:09.839 align:start position:0%
long-term measures taken by the state
 
00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
with the state goals of reducing the
 
00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
spread and so on thank you I was a
 
00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:52.030 --> 00:46:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:55.829 --> 00:46:55.839 align:start position:0%
eight moving on to page
 
00:47:36.349 --> 00:47:36.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:40.040 align:start position:0%
any changes to page nine if not we'll
 
00:47:47.309 --> 00:47:47.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:53.829 --> 00:47:53.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
off um I don't know if we have time to
 
00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:01.880 align:start position:0%
expanded but on page nine four
 
00:48:06.270 --> 00:48:06.280 align:start position:0%
paragraph for example initial safety
 
00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
criteria are specifically established to
 
00:48:12.549 --> 00:48:12.559 align:start position:0%
monitor the roll out of these
 
00:48:15.069 --> 00:48:15.079 align:start position:0%
products so I have a question to
 
00:48:15.079 --> 00:48:16.510 align:start position:0%
products so I have a question to
representative

00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:16.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
name um what was the official name for
 
00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
those initial safety
 
00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
criteria um and that abbreviation
 
00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:35.960 align:start position:0%
escapes U my my mind but I think it was
 
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
those type of statistical analysis that
 
00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:43.400 align:start position:0%
they initially was suggested to using on
 
00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
adverse reaction
 
00:48:50.349 --> 00:48:50.359 align:start position:0%
database uh so uh I would suggest like
 
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
specifically naming the official name of
 
00:48:58.829 --> 00:48:58.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:00.349 --> 00:49:00.359 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher thank you madam
 
00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative poov
 
00:49:07.069 --> 00:49:07.079 align:start position:0%
I don't off the top of my head remember
 
00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
the exact name and I do remember there
 
00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:10.520 align:start position:0%
there was two different ones and I would
 
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
hate to try to get the right one and put
 
00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:14.720 align:start position:0%
the wrong one in there so if somebody
 
00:49:17.549 --> 00:49:17.559 align:start position:0%
has the know 100% the correct one
 
00:49:19.069 --> 00:49:19.079 align:start position:0%
perhaps we could add that but without
 
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
knowing exactly what that was I would
 
00:49:22.109 --> 00:49:22.119 align:start position:0%
hate to add it and then have an
 
00:49:27.390 --> 00:49:27.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
so the question is is does anyone know
 
00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:31.950 align:start position:0%
so the question is is does anyone know
what

00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:31.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
is uh we can come back to that if you
 
00:49:36.349 --> 00:49:36.359 align:start position:0%
want to look at up that up uh represent
 
00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
POS represent beler thank you madam
 
00:49:40.349 --> 00:49:40.359 align:start position:0%
chair um representative Pensa brought to
 
00:49:42.030 --> 00:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
my attention there was an error on
 
00:49:46.109 --> 00:49:46.119 align:start position:0%
paragraph two on page nine where uh
 
00:49:48.589 --> 00:49:48.599 align:start position:0%
second sentence the word can should be
 
00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
changed to cannot there was just an
 
00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
all right perfect um and this is why
 
00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
we're going through it like this
 
00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:09.789 align:start position:0%
we're going through it like this
because

00:50:09.789 --> 00:50:09.799 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:50:12.750 --> 00:50:12.760 align:start position:0%
uh it's easy
 
00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
to uh play Monday Morning Quarterback uh
 
00:50:19.829 --> 00:50:19.839 align:start position:0%
and catch those mistakes after the fact
 
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:35.950 --> 00:50:35.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:38.150 align:start position:0%
 
nine

00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
nine
 
00:51:09.829 --> 00:51:09.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:14.190 --> 00:51:14.200 align:start position:0%
um so in the first sentence on page 10
 
00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
the word ultimate is pretty strong um I
 
00:51:22.870 --> 00:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
don't know how everyone I don't think
 
00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:25.000 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
really we can't really say that I think
 
00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:29.870 align:start position:0%
really we can't really say that I think
that's

00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:29.880 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:32.920 align:start position:0%
problematic but represent
 
00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:35.640 align:start position:0%
poent I agree I think the word ultimate
 
00:51:39.549 --> 00:51:39.559 align:start position:0%
can be removed um because it's uh it's
 
00:51:42.309 --> 00:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
it's too strong and it's it harsh I
 
00:51:46.589 --> 00:51:46.599 align:start position:0%
think you can take that out and
 
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
um you know failure is you know uh I
 
00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
think keeping that there is fine so
 
00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
given the failure of our state actions
 
00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
to have any meaningful demonstrable
 
00:51:58.030 --> 00:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
impact on the course of the
 
00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
pandemic um I think that's important
 
00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:05.990 align:start position:0%
pandemic um I think that's important
because

00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:08.349 --> 00:52:08.359 align:start position:0%
to we have to say failure because we
 
00:52:11.069 --> 00:52:11.079 align:start position:0%
don't we can't say that we there's only
 
00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:13.480 align:start position:0%
there's two things what that either we
 
00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
made you know a change or like we
 
00:52:18.109 --> 00:52:18.119 align:start position:0%
actually there was a positive outcome
 
00:52:20.789 --> 00:52:20.799 align:start position:0%
which we don't have any any um
 
00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
information on so it would be I mean
 
00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
failure is the only piece that I would I
 
00:52:27.069 --> 00:52:27.079 align:start position:0%
could see in there
 
00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
um I'm actually representing Belcher
 
00:52:31.829 --> 00:52:31.839 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I think the you
 
00:52:33.870 --> 00:52:33.880 align:start position:0%
know different words are going to have
 
00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:35.640 align:start position:0%
various definitions but how they're used
 
00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:37.000 align:start position:0%
I think the manner in which ultimate was
 
00:52:39.109 --> 00:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
used in this case was not meant to
 
00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:41.880 align:start position:0%
express severe but more more Collective
 
00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
so perhaps the word Collective or um
 
00:52:46.710 --> 00:52:46.720 align:start position:0%
cumulative might be might be more
 
00:52:49.549 --> 00:52:49.559 align:start position:0%
appropriate in that place okay um but
 
00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
I'm also even thinking you know
 
00:52:56.470 --> 00:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
given uh our state's actions just
 
00:52:57.710 --> 00:52:57.720 align:start position:0%
leaving that section out to have any
 
00:52:59.470 --> 00:52:59.480 align:start position:0%
meaningful demonstrable impact on the
 
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
course of the pandemic it is recommended
 
00:53:04.190 --> 00:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
for further study um but you're saying
 
00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
no um so um because we're still saying
 
00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
no matter how we state it that the we
 
00:53:14.510 --> 00:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
are recommending for fur the study
 
00:53:17.470 --> 00:53:17.480 align:start position:0%
um because of what we have learned
 
00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:18.640 align:start position:0%
throughout the report and I think
 
00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:20.680 align:start position:0%
throughout the report I don't think we
 
00:53:22.270 --> 00:53:22.280 align:start position:0%
have to put ultimate and failure in
 
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
there I think the report itself speaks
 
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:26.200 align:start position:0%
for itself because we are pointing out
 
00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:28.720 align:start position:0%
the weak points and where we feel that
 
00:53:31.470 --> 00:53:31.480 align:start position:0%
they have it was we fell short but
 
00:53:35.549 --> 00:53:35.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
off uh when we we have time I would like
 
00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
to go back to page nine uh I I
 
00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:46.240 align:start position:0%
found or are we finishing with 10 let's
 
00:53:47.549 --> 00:53:47.559 align:start position:0%
finish with 10 and then we can go back
 
00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
to page
 
00:53:52.870 --> 00:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
nine representative
 
00:53:55.630 --> 00:53:55.640 align:start position:0%
Penza uh thank you madam chair I agree
 
00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
with you on that I think you can just
 
00:53:59.789 --> 00:53:59.799 align:start position:0%
remove both and I think it says enough
 
00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to um add in a word you
 
00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
could basically just say given the
 
00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
collective State actions to have any you
 
00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
could literally put collective in there
 
00:54:12.829 --> 00:54:12.839 align:start position:0%
um so it just basically says
 
00:54:15.069 --> 00:54:15.079 align:start position:0%
all-encompassing so I think either way
 
00:54:18.270 --> 00:54:18.280 align:start position:0%
it's fine um you know representative
 
00:54:20.910 --> 00:54:20.920 align:start position:0%
bel's point in regards with all of the
 
00:54:22.670 --> 00:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
collective efforts so I think that you
 
00:54:24.789 --> 00:54:24.799 align:start position:0%
could add that word in but I definitely
 
00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
think you can remove both ultimate and
 
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
necessary represent
 
00:54:36.109 --> 00:54:36.119 align:start position:0%
beler all right took a minute just to re
 
00:54:38.069 --> 00:54:38.079 align:start position:0%
rework that sentence so let's see how
 
00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
this sounds instead given that our
 
00:54:42.069 --> 00:54:42.079 align:start position:0%
state's actions did not have any
 
00:54:43.829 --> 00:54:43.839 align:start position:0%
meaningful demonstrable impact on the
 
00:54:46.789 --> 00:54:46.799 align:start position:0%
course of the pandemic
 
00:54:50.589 --> 00:54:50.599 align:start position:0%
comma comma wh wrong
 
00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:52.799 align:start position:0%
button it is recommended for further
 
00:54:54.589 --> 00:54:54.599 align:start position:0%
study and we call upon the private
 
00:54:57.230 --> 00:54:57.240 align:start position:0%
sectors an Academia to study and at in
 
00:55:01.950 --> 00:55:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
agents uh anyone's
 
00:55:07.870 --> 00:55:07.880 align:start position:0%
thoughts represent P off represent wory
 
00:55:09.309 --> 00:55:09.319 align:start position:0%
okay yeah perfect thank you
 
00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
representative beler and let's go back
 
00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
to no seeing no other changes on page 10
 
00:55:17.789 --> 00:55:17.799 align:start position:0%
represent PLL off page nine you've got
 
00:55:21.190 --> 00:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
the floor so again uh first paragraph on
 
00:55:24.829 --> 00:55:24.839 align:start position:0%
page nine uh line five and first
 
00:55:27.630 --> 00:55:27.640 align:start position:0%
paragraph for example example initial
 
00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
safety criteria uh and then uh in
 
00:55:36.309 --> 00:55:36.319 align:start position:0%
parenthesis we we name proportional
 
00:55:39.630 --> 00:55:39.640 align:start position:0%
reporting ratio P
 
00:55:44.109 --> 00:55:44.119 align:start position:0%
RR so I think that was uh the standards
 
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
the CDC was using uh to evaluate uh
 
00:55:50.710 --> 00:55:50.720 align:start position:0%
safety signals on
 
00:55:52.870 --> 00:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
vacines okay so what you're saying is
 
00:55:54.910 --> 00:55:54.920 align:start position:0%
after the where it says for example then
 
00:55:57.150 --> 00:55:57.160 align:start position:0%
an initial safety C teror then you want
 
00:55:59.390 --> 00:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
to put in parentheses what you just
 
00:56:02.309 --> 00:56:02.319 align:start position:0%
stated is that correct yes proportional
 
00:56:11.870 --> 00:56:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:15.309 --> 00:56:15.319 align:start position:0%
r uh so technically it's the third you
 
00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:20.829 --> 00:56:20.839 align:start position:0%
page uh paragraph starts what is
 
00:56:38.109 --> 00:56:38.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:39.870 --> 00:56:39.880 align:start position:0%
represent Belair thank you mam chair can
 
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
you just say that one more time I know
 
00:56:44.750 --> 00:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
it was prr but does that stand for
 
00:56:48.829 --> 00:56:48.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:54.910 --> 00:56:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:15.349 --> 00:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
off is that a document that we need to
 
00:57:20.750 --> 00:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:24.630 --> 00:57:24.640 align:start position:0%
report uh it was in oral
 
00:57:29.230 --> 00:57:29.240 align:start position:0%
testimony um uh but uh there are some
 
00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:30.309 align:start position:0%
testimony um uh but uh there are some
more

00:57:30.309 --> 00:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:57:34.029 --> 00:57:34.039 align:start position:0%
detailed explanation of that
 
00:57:38.029 --> 00:57:38.039 align:start position:0%
statistical um method online basically
 
00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
just comparing uh like volumes of
 
00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
vaccine to their uh reported side
 
00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
effects so uh I don't think we need to
 
00:57:51.390 --> 00:57:51.400 align:start position:0%
file new documents it's people can find
 
00:57:53.510 --> 00:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
it online if they need
 
00:57:56.670 --> 00:57:56.680 align:start position:0%
it thank you
 
00:57:59.510 --> 00:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
represent beler thank you madam s so in
 
00:58:00.990 --> 00:58:01.000 align:start position:0%
response what I've done is I've added
 
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
the sentence one such methodology
 
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
established prior to the vaccine roll
 
00:58:09.230 --> 00:58:09.240 align:start position:0%
out was the proportional reporting ratio
 
00:58:12.430 --> 00:58:12.440 align:start position:0%
prr thank
 
00:58:16.549 --> 00:58:16.559 align:start position:0%
you everyone everyone represent po
 
00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
off could you read how it would play
 
00:58:22.510 --> 00:58:22.520 align:start position:0%
with the next sentence is it before for
 
00:58:26.910 --> 00:58:26.920 align:start position:0%
example or could you read like all the
 
00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
changes sure um so it's a middle of the
 
00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
paragraph on page let's see paragraph
 
00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
one two three four on page
 
00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:40.160 align:start position:0%
nine um starting with for
 
00:58:42.510 --> 00:58:42.520 align:start position:0%
example initial safety criteria
 
00:58:43.950 --> 00:58:43.960 align:start position:0%
specifically established to monitor the
 
00:58:46.029 --> 00:58:46.039 align:start position:0%
roll out of these products serious
 
00:58:47.950 --> 00:58:47.960 align:start position:0%
adverse reactions and Adverse Events are
 
00:58:49.470 --> 00:58:49.480 align:start position:0%
to be monitored and tracked by the
 
00:58:51.069 --> 00:58:51.079 align:start position:0%
federal agencies during the weeks to
 
00:58:54.390 --> 00:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
months of initial vaccine availability
 
00:58:56.430 --> 00:58:56.440 align:start position:0%
one such methodology established a
 
00:58:58.029 --> 00:58:58.039 align:start position:0%
vaccine roll out was the proportional
 
00:58:59.510 --> 00:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
reporting ratio
 
00:59:02.069 --> 00:59:02.079 align:start position:0%
prr as tracked by these agencies if a
 
00:59:03.710 --> 00:59:03.720 align:start position:0%
trend or signal of significant adverse
 
00:59:06.430 --> 00:59:06.440 align:start position:0%
outcomes reaches reaches its established
 
00:59:08.789 --> 00:59:08.799 align:start position:0%
thresholds for acting then the agencies
 
00:59:11.870 --> 00:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:14.240 align:start position:0%
product is that acceptable she represent
 
00:59:17.470 --> 00:59:17.480 align:start position:0%
pulls off okay represent
 
00:59:23.109 --> 00:59:23.119 align:start position:0%
weary and okay all right any other
 
00:59:26.470 --> 00:59:26.480 align:start position:0%
anything else on page nine
 
00:59:27.630 --> 00:59:27.640 align:start position:0%
I think that's going to be the page
 
00:59:31.430 --> 00:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:34.210 --> 00:59:34.220 align:start position:0%
too if not we'll move on to page
 
00:59:34.220 --> 00:59:42.549 align:start position:0%
too if not we'll move on to page
[Music]

00:59:42.549 --> 00:59:42.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:47.160 align:start position:0%
11 okay on page on page
 
00:59:50.670 --> 00:59:50.680 align:start position:0%
11 um are you changing executive to the
 
00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
covid uh just a a you're taking out the
 
00:59:58.029 --> 00:59:58.039 align:start position:0%
word executive at the top top of page
 
01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
11 because it's the after Action Report
 
01:00:50.789 --> 01:00:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:54.069 --> 01:00:54.079 align:start position:0%
anything on page 11 if not page 12
 
01:00:54.079 --> 01:01:25.870 align:start position:0%
anything on page 11 if not page 12
please

01:01:25.870 --> 01:01:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:25.880 --> 01:02:06.710 align:start position:0%
 
for

01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:10.950 --> 01:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
um I have on page 11
 
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
12 fourth
 
01:02:16.750 --> 01:02:16.760 align:start position:0%
paragraph it said uh the committee did
 
01:02:19.230 --> 01:02:19.240 align:start position:0%
receive testimony from relevant state
 
01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:21.720 align:start position:0%
public health authorities that once a
 
01:02:23.269 --> 01:02:23.279 align:start position:0%
course of action was decided on there
 
01:02:25.109 --> 01:02:25.119 align:start position:0%
was an overriding decision made that
 
01:02:27.069 --> 01:02:27.079 align:start position:0%
would uh would not readily change course
 
01:02:29.109 --> 01:02:29.119 align:start position:0%
it was not a public health authority
 
01:02:32.190 --> 01:02:32.200 align:start position:0%
that we received that testimony from but
 
01:02:34.990 --> 01:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
it was someone who was in charge of the
 
01:02:38.349 --> 01:02:38.359 align:start position:0%
task force and a commissioner uh that is
 
01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
of um that is not related to Public
 
01:02:44.910 --> 01:02:44.920 align:start position:0%
Health I was commissioner Caswell
 
01:02:47.150 --> 01:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
specifically um yes representative
 
01:02:49.109 --> 01:02:49.119 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you madam chair I I
 
01:02:50.910 --> 01:02:50.920 align:start position:0%
believe and correct me if I'm wrong but
 
01:02:52.510 --> 01:02:52.520 align:start position:0%
I believe that that sentiment was first
 
01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
received by the committee by um uh was
 
01:02:58.510 --> 01:02:58.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner Tilly yes okay maybe I I
 
01:03:01.150 --> 01:03:01.160 align:start position:0%
missed that portion but I remember
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
specifically uh commissioner Caswell
 
01:03:06.789 --> 01:03:06.799 align:start position:0%
stated within the task force that he was
 
01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
in charge of that they stated that you
 
01:03:11.349 --> 01:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
know they were going to stay the course
 
01:03:12.750 --> 01:03:12.760 align:start position:0%
and know and they weren't going to make
 
01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:15.720 align:start position:0%
any changes or Veer off of that their
 
01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
what they were doing okay uh represent
 
01:03:20.990 --> 01:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
Penza if you want it because I do
 
01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
remember um that was at the beginning of
 
01:03:26.430 --> 01:03:26.440 align:start position:0%
our committee uh that it was um it was
 
01:03:28.190 --> 01:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
pretty clear that that was the case as
 
01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
well with um um with Mrs Tilly so but if
 
01:03:34.309 --> 01:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
you wanted
 
01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
to maybe you could say um the committee
 
01:03:40.910 --> 01:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
did receive testimony from relevant
 
01:03:43.269 --> 01:03:43.279 align:start position:0%
state public health authorities or you
 
01:03:46.430 --> 01:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
could say or um from relevant
 
01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
state state authorities because it was
 
01:03:52.150 --> 01:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
more than one correct I don't want it to
 
01:03:54.750 --> 01:03:54.760 align:start position:0%
be thank you so if we could change that
 
01:04:18.029 --> 01:04:18.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:21.109 --> 01:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
Health any other changes needed on page
 
01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
12 if not let's go to page
 
01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:54.630 align:start position:0%
12 if not let's go to page
13

01:04:54.630 --> 01:04:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:55.470 --> 01:05:55.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:57.910 --> 01:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
oh okay what are you seeing as something
 
01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:13.190 align:start position:0%
 
Penza

01:06:13.190 --> 01:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
Penza
 
01:06:15.109 --> 01:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
okay could you just point out the
 
01:06:16.349 --> 01:06:16.359 align:start position:0%
paragraph that we're talking about
 
01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher yes thank you madam
 
01:06:19.670 --> 01:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
chair has brought to my attention
 
01:06:22.029 --> 01:06:22.039 align:start position:0%
paragraph three the opening sentence was
 
01:06:24.430 --> 01:06:24.440 align:start position:0%
a little bit unclear which perfectly
 
01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:26.079 align:start position:0%
fair so I've made an adjustment and I'll
 
01:06:26.079 --> 01:06:27.230 align:start position:0%
fair so I've made an adjustment and I'll
read

01:06:27.230 --> 01:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
read
 
01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
it IR rationale that authorities threw
 
01:06:31.390 --> 01:06:31.400 align:start position:0%
everything at the wall to see what would
 
01:06:34.029 --> 01:06:34.039 align:start position:0%
stick is an inadequate explanation and
 
01:06:35.870 --> 01:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
such an approach has the potential to
 
01:06:39.390 --> 01:06:39.400 align:start position:0%
cause inadvertent harm and unintended
 
01:06:41.589 --> 01:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
consequences okay so instead of saying
 
01:06:43.829 --> 01:06:43.839 align:start position:0%
suggesting that authorities you change
 
01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:46.640 align:start position:0%
those word that
 
01:06:49.230 --> 01:06:49.240 align:start position:0%
wording okay
 
01:06:51.990 --> 01:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
any comments on that or any problem with
 
01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.349 align:start position:0%
any comments on that or any problem with
those

01:06:54.349 --> 01:06:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:59.029 --> 01:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:03.630 --> 01:07:03.640 align:start position:0%
weary um maybe we could just be a
 
01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
little clearer in in saying
 
01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:12.670 align:start position:0%
little clearer in in saying
that

01:07:12.670 --> 01:07:12.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:22.349 --> 01:07:22.359 align:start position:0%
trying something to the effect of um the
 
01:07:26.029 --> 01:07:26.039 align:start position:0%
authorities were not sure what measures
 
01:07:29.950 --> 01:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
would work correct and therefore we're
 
01:07:37.109 --> 01:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:39.710 --> 01:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
simultaneously uh and then you could use
 
01:07:41.950 --> 01:07:41.960 align:start position:0%
the through everything at the wall to
 
01:07:43.710 --> 01:07:43.720 align:start position:0%
see what would stick analogy which I
 
01:07:48.150 --> 01:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:52.549 --> 01:07:52.559 align:start position:0%
appropo and then um you know so that's
 
01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
the statement the the authorities were
 
01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:58.710 align:start position:0%
the statement the the authorities were
trying

01:07:58.710 --> 01:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
because of the
 
01:08:05.710 --> 01:08:05.720 align:start position:0%
unknown nature of the of
 
01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:07.589 align:start position:0%
unknown nature of the of
the

01:08:07.589 --> 01:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
virus it it spread
 
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
lethality Etc um the authorities were
 
01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:21.430 align:start position:0%
lethality Etc um the authorities were
trying

01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:24.950 --> 01:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
multiple uh approaches simultaneously
 
01:08:28.990 --> 01:08:29.000 align:start position:0%
toid at the virus and then you
 
01:08:31.470 --> 01:08:31.480 align:start position:0%
know I.E they threw everything at the
 
01:08:34.749 --> 01:08:34.759 align:start position:0%
wall to see what would stick
 
01:08:39.070 --> 01:08:39.080 align:start position:0%
period this however this rationale for
 
01:08:45.149 --> 01:08:45.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:48.269 --> 01:08:48.279 align:start position:0%
explanation is
 
01:08:51.829 --> 01:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
insufficient and not having adequate
 
01:08:54.749 --> 01:08:54.759 align:start position:0%
explanation has the potential to cause
 
01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:09.910 --> 01:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
consequences so all right
 
01:09:13.510 --> 01:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
um so if someone wants to work on the
 
01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
rewording of that paragraph um that
 
01:09:18.430 --> 01:09:18.440 align:start position:0%
would be great represent
 
01:09:21.630 --> 01:09:21.640 align:start position:0%
Penza I think the whole point of it is
 
01:09:24.149 --> 01:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
um there were what we're trying to say
 
01:09:26.709 --> 01:09:26.719 align:start position:0%
in that paragraph is that that um there
 
01:09:28.510 --> 01:09:28.520 align:start position:0%
were a lot of different things that were
 
01:09:30.510 --> 01:09:30.520 align:start position:0%
used and that were tried because we
 
01:09:34.189 --> 01:09:34.199 align:start position:0%
didn't know right but in doing so we
 
01:09:36.030 --> 01:09:36.040 align:start position:0%
have to be very careful to make sure
 
01:09:38.829 --> 01:09:38.839 align:start position:0%
that we are not um impeding trampling on
 
01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
the on the rights the constitutional
 
01:09:43.390 --> 01:09:43.400 align:start position:0%
rights and all and the liberty of you
 
01:09:45.749 --> 01:09:45.759 align:start position:0%
know citizens and all of that so that's
 
01:09:47.910 --> 01:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
the point of that paragraph and I don't
 
01:09:49.950 --> 01:09:49.960 align:start position:0%
believe it was Comm it started off that
 
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
way so I think that's what he's working
 
01:09:54.350 --> 01:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
on right now uh representative beler
 
01:09:55.470 --> 01:09:55.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and I would
 
01:09:58.510 --> 01:09:58.520 align:start position:0%
generally concur I think the the point
 
01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
the thrust of that paragraph was
 
01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:02.070 align:start position:0%
the thrust of that paragraph was
intending

01:10:02.070 --> 01:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
intending
 
01:10:05.669 --> 01:10:05.679 align:start position:0%
to get the get the point across that
 
01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:08.280 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about measures that
 
01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
both individually and cumulatively have
 
01:10:14.709 --> 01:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
real serious um Liberty Financial
 
01:10:16.470 --> 01:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
economic other implications for the
 
01:10:20.350 --> 01:10:20.360 align:start position:0%
people of the State uh simply using the
 
01:10:22.110 --> 01:10:22.120 align:start position:0%
the old phrase well we threw everything
 
01:10:24.709 --> 01:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
at the wall to see what would stick is
 
01:10:26.229 --> 01:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
just it just does doesn't cut it that's
 
01:10:28.149 --> 01:10:28.159 align:start position:0%
not enough of an explanation there needs
 
01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
to be a reasonable
 
01:10:34.110 --> 01:10:34.120 align:start position:0%
expectation that there will be first of
 
01:10:35.790 --> 01:10:35.800 align:start position:0%
all that there's necessity and second of
 
01:10:38.430 --> 01:10:38.440 align:start position:0%
all that there will be success from from
 
01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
what is being done um I I'm just going
 
01:10:45.709 --> 01:10:45.719 align:start position:0%
to throw out there that for me
 
01:10:49.630 --> 01:10:49.640 align:start position:0%
um when you throw everything at the wall
 
01:10:51.870 --> 01:10:51.880 align:start position:0%
how do you know what is actually
 
01:10:55.270 --> 01:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
effective and what is not effective uh
 
01:10:57.030 --> 01:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
representative beler then represent
 
01:10:58.669 --> 01:10:58.679 align:start position:0%
poent thank you madam chair and that's a
 
01:11:00.510 --> 01:11:00.520 align:start position:0%
very good point and just a little later
 
01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
in the report there is a substantial
 
01:11:05.390 --> 01:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
sort of scientific breakout as to what
 
01:11:07.950 --> 01:11:07.960 align:start position:0%
confounding variables are and how you
 
01:11:10.750 --> 01:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
are unable to determine the efficacy of
 
01:11:12.709 --> 01:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
any individual me measure when they're
 
01:11:15.669 --> 01:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
taken cumulatively in such a
 
01:11:18.189 --> 01:11:18.199 align:start position:0%
fashion go ahead represent Penza yeah
 
01:11:19.950 --> 01:11:19.960 align:start position:0%
and the good thing about that paragraph
 
01:11:22.229 --> 01:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
is at the end it basically the last
 
01:11:24.550 --> 01:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
sentence talks about that so make sure
 
01:11:26.149 --> 01:11:26.159 align:start position:0%
that we keep that last sentence because
 
01:11:29.550 --> 01:11:29.560 align:start position:0%
that's that's kind of the most um most
 
01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
important so right here it says the
 
01:11:33.270 --> 01:11:33.280 align:start position:0%
people must know that such proposed
 
01:11:36.630 --> 01:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
measures are temporary temporary with a
 
01:11:38.910 --> 01:11:38.920 align:start position:0%
definitive timeline for the cessation of
 
01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
the Extreme Measures um you know you
 
01:11:43.390 --> 01:11:43.400 align:start position:0%
could expand on that to basically say
 
01:11:46.229 --> 01:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
Well when a when something's put into
 
01:11:48.910 --> 01:11:48.920 align:start position:0%
place you evaluate you see if it's
 
01:11:51.310 --> 01:11:51.320 align:start position:0%
working and if it's not then you pull
 
01:11:52.669 --> 01:11:52.679 align:start position:0%
that back and then you try something
 
01:11:55.229 --> 01:11:55.239 align:start position:0%
else that's the most important thing if
 
01:11:57.070 --> 01:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
if you're trying everything all at once
 
01:11:59.189 --> 01:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
there's no way for you to know what's
 
01:12:01.229 --> 01:12:01.239 align:start position:0%
effective and what's not okay
 
01:12:01.239 --> 01:12:02.510 align:start position:0%
effective and what's not okay
representative

01:12:02.510 --> 01:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:12:05.790 --> 01:12:05.800 align:start position:0%
weary so yeah just to Echo that as a as
 
01:12:09.669 --> 01:12:09.679 align:start position:0%
a process engineer um you know if you if
 
01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
you if you have um a multivariant
 
01:12:16.270 --> 01:12:16.280 align:start position:0%
problem with many different factors and
 
01:12:19.709 --> 01:12:19.719 align:start position:0%
you do experiments to try and either
 
01:12:22.430 --> 01:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
optimize a process or do anything and
 
01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
you change them indiscriminately and
 
01:12:29.070 --> 01:12:29.080 align:start position:0%
randomly and and and are not tracking
 
01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
what you're
 
01:12:33.189 --> 01:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
doing you C you cause more problems
 
01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
because you don't know what you've done
 
01:12:38.669 --> 01:12:38.679 align:start position:0%
in actuality so um I I think I've I've
 
01:12:41.669 --> 01:12:41.679 align:start position:0%
made some suggestions to representative
 
01:12:44.470 --> 01:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
belter uh to improve that and I think
 
01:12:48.430 --> 01:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
he's uh nearly ready for uh a reread of
 
01:12:51.790 --> 01:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
that first several sentences are you
 
01:12:53.669 --> 01:12:53.679 align:start position:0%
ready representative beler indeed I am
 
01:12:56.350 --> 01:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
here's the whole rework paragraph okay
 
01:12:58.229 --> 01:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
thank you in response to the unknown
 
01:13:00.149 --> 01:13:00.159 align:start position:0%
factors being caused by the virus the
 
01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
authorities tried simultaneously
 
01:13:04.110 --> 01:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
multiple approaches to mitigating the
 
01:13:06.310 --> 01:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
virus I.E they threw everything at the
 
01:13:09.070 --> 01:13:09.080 align:start position:0%
wall to see what would stick however
 
01:13:11.390 --> 01:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
this rationale to justify a multitude of
 
01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
measures impinging on citizens rights
 
01:13:15.790 --> 01:13:15.800 align:start position:0%
and significant economic interests is an
 
01:13:18.110 --> 01:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
inadequate justification to imp
 
01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
implementing measures
 
01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
indiscriminately such an approach has
 
01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
the potential to cause inadvertent harm
 
01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
and unintended consequences
 
01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
when proposed measures also have the
 
01:13:29.790 --> 01:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
potential to constrain personal Liberty
 
01:13:31.470 --> 01:13:31.480 align:start position:0%
undermine constitutional rights or
 
01:13:33.470 --> 01:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
financial freedoms people must be able
 
01:13:35.629 --> 01:13:35.639 align:start position:0%
to understand the rationale and
 
01:13:37.669 --> 01:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
justifications for Extreme Measures
 
01:13:40.390 --> 01:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
dictated by emergency circumstances the
 
01:13:42.229 --> 01:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
people must also know that such proposed
 
01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
measures are temporary with a definitive
 
01:13:46.110 --> 01:13:46.120 align:start position:0%
timeline for the cessation of the
 
01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:48.550 align:start position:0%
timeline for the cessation of the
Extreme

01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
Extreme
 
01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
Measures any
 
01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
discussion okay then I'm going to move
 
01:13:58.590 --> 01:13:58.600 align:start position:0%
on to the last paragraph on that page or
 
01:14:01.870 --> 01:14:01.880 align:start position:0%
sentence um furthermore given the
 
01:14:04.350 --> 01:14:04.360 align:start position:0%
testimony received it must be identified
 
01:14:16.709 --> 01:14:16.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:19.390 --> 01:14:19.400 align:start position:0%
missing representative weary uh thank
 
01:14:21.430 --> 01:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
you madam chair maybe just uh moving it
 
01:14:23.830 --> 01:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
must be identified as a fault and just
 
01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
um kind of moving that that concept to
 
01:14:30.750 --> 01:14:30.760 align:start position:0%
the end of the sentence and then uh I
 
01:14:33.550 --> 01:14:33.560 align:start position:0%
think it can just be say it ju could
 
01:14:36.750 --> 01:14:36.760 align:start position:0%
just be said that it is inappropriate or
 
01:14:39.470 --> 01:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
or something stronger if necessary but
 
01:14:42.149 --> 01:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
it's it's any insistence on staying a
 
01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
particular course of action without
 
01:14:46.229 --> 01:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
ongoing review is inadequate and
 
01:14:46.239 --> 01:14:48.229 align:start position:0%
ongoing review is inadequate and
inappropriate

01:14:48.229 --> 01:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
inappropriate
 
01:14:50.430 --> 01:14:50.440 align:start position:0%
exactly okay representative Bel are you
 
01:14:52.510 --> 01:14:52.520 align:start position:0%
going to read us that sentence now yes I
 
01:14:54.229 --> 01:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
I made a minor modification let's see if
 
01:14:56.149 --> 01:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
people are are okay with this
 
01:14:58.709 --> 01:14:58.719 align:start position:0%
furthermore given the testimony received
 
01:15:00.629 --> 01:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
it must be identified as a fault the
 
01:15:03.310 --> 01:15:03.320 align:start position:0%
expressed inent insistence on staying a
 
01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
particular course of action without
 
01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:07.390 align:start position:0%
particular course of action without
ongoing

01:15:07.390 --> 01:15:07.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
review um I think I like the way that
 
01:15:12.629 --> 01:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
representative weary worded it a little
 
01:15:15.470 --> 01:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
bit better because it seemed to flow
 
01:15:23.950 --> 01:15:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:53.910 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

01:15:53.910 --> 01:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:28.430 --> 01:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
representative weary would you like to
 
01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
read us that yes thank you madam chair
 
01:16:34.229 --> 01:16:34.239 align:start position:0%
uh so uh further so just the top
 
01:16:36.390 --> 01:16:36.400 align:start position:0%
sentence in in that last paragraph than
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
you furthermore given the testimony
 
01:16:40.229 --> 01:16:40.239 align:start position:0%
receive any insistence on staying a
 
01:16:41.790 --> 01:16:41.800 align:start position:0%
particular course of action without an
 
01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:49.310 --> 01:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
inappropriate any further discussion on
 
01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:02.709 align:start position:0%
 
page

01:17:02.709 --> 01:17:02.719 align:start position:0%
page
 
01:17:20.669 --> 01:17:20.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:24.070 --> 01:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
along Madam's here yes I just want to
 
01:17:26.629 --> 01:17:26.639 align:start position:0%
make clear after before Banning page 14
 
01:17:29.910 --> 01:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
long okay um I have a something on the
 
01:17:38.629 --> 01:17:38.639 align:start position:0%
first paragraph one two fourth line at
 
01:17:41.430 --> 01:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
the end it says it was highlighted to
 
01:17:43.270 --> 01:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
this Committee in
 
01:17:45.709 --> 01:17:45.719 align:start position:0%
testimony uh this Committee in testimony
 
01:17:48.189 --> 01:17:48.199 align:start position:0%
and data that and I would take out very
 
01:17:49.470 --> 01:17:49.480 align:start position:0%
I would just use
 
01:17:52.950 --> 01:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
many um I I
 
01:17:55.870 --> 01:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
think I don't know if you need very in
 
01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
there that's a personal opinion but I'd
 
01:18:01.030 --> 01:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
like to see what the committee
 
01:18:03.870 --> 01:18:03.880 align:start position:0%
thinks uh fourth line down at the very
 
01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
end uh and data that very
 
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
many that many what what section are we
 
01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:19.149 --> 01:18:19.159 align:start position:0%
14 represent we so it's the uh beginning
 
01:18:22.110 --> 01:18:22.120 align:start position:0%
of section B so level of disruptions to
 
01:18:25.270 --> 01:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
individual first paragraph there and
 
01:18:30.750 --> 01:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
then so it's then um about the
 
01:18:34.590 --> 01:18:34.600 align:start position:0%
Midway uh down
 
01:18:38.709 --> 01:18:38.719 align:start position:0%
so so testimony and data that very
 
01:18:38.719 --> 01:18:41.669 align:start position:0%
so so testimony and data that very
many

01:18:41.669 --> 01:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
many
 
01:18:44.189 --> 01:18:44.199 align:start position:0%
so is everyone okay with the removal of
 
01:18:46.030 --> 01:18:46.040 align:start position:0%
the word
 
01:18:53.550 --> 01:18:53.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:56.110 --> 01:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
you yeah
 
01:18:58.790 --> 01:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
yeah the next sentence uh starts with
 
01:19:00.430 --> 01:19:00.440 align:start position:0%
very many so many
 
01:19:02.950 --> 01:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
parents I would actually take out many I
 
01:19:04.470 --> 01:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
would just say parents Express to this
 
01:19:11.709 --> 01:19:11.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:14.310 --> 01:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
fine because many implies that we had a
 
01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
lot of parents testifying and that is
 
01:19:23.709 --> 01:19:23.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:23.719 --> 01:19:53.629 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:19:53.629 --> 01:19:53.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:53.639 --> 01:20:23.629 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:20:23.629 --> 01:20:23.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:23.639 --> 01:20:53.629 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:20:53.629 --> 01:20:53.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:46.310 --> 01:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:49.669 --> 01:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
representative weary yeah uh just
 
01:21:52.189 --> 01:21:52.199 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to be a little bit more
 
01:21:55.390 --> 01:21:55.400 align:start position:0%
direct in in uh the second to the last
 
01:21:59.149 --> 01:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
paragraph in section B there that a
 
01:22:01.669 --> 01:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
sentence that starts out any reasonable
 
01:22:05.470 --> 01:22:05.480 align:start position:0%
analysis um I'd like to make that uh
 
01:22:07.470 --> 01:22:07.480 align:start position:0%
just a little clear by dropping a few
 
01:22:11.470 --> 01:22:11.480 align:start position:0%
words here so um any reasonable analysis
 
01:22:13.350 --> 01:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
of the efficacy of the measures taken
 
01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
must find that cumulative the
 
01:22:19.750 --> 01:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
measures did not halt the spread of the
 
01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
disease so or if if you want wish to
 
01:22:24.629 --> 01:22:24.639 align:start position:0%
make it strong it could be failed to to
 
01:22:26.229 --> 01:22:26.239 align:start position:0%
Halt the spread of the disease but I
 
01:22:29.229 --> 01:22:29.239 align:start position:0%
think I think that sentence needs to be
 
01:22:32.629 --> 01:22:32.639 align:start position:0%
just very you know more direct because I
 
01:22:32.639 --> 01:22:34.310 align:start position:0%
just very you know more direct because I
think

01:22:34.310 --> 01:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:22:37.470 --> 01:22:37.480 align:start position:0%
that's that is a main finding of the
 
01:22:40.110 --> 01:22:40.120 align:start position:0%
committee accordingly and so I think if
 
01:22:42.590 --> 01:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
we can be clear there that's helpful I
 
01:22:44.030 --> 01:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
think the word halt without the word
 
01:22:46.390 --> 01:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
failed in front of it would is is good
 
01:22:48.550 --> 01:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
because Halt and failed actually mean
 
01:22:51.149 --> 01:22:51.159 align:start position:0%
the same thing so just use the world
 
01:22:54.070 --> 01:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
halt in my opinion any anybody have any
 
01:22:56.149 --> 01:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
discussion represent Bel thank M chair
 
01:22:58.790 --> 01:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not entirely clear on what what
 
01:23:00.270 --> 01:23:00.280 align:start position:0%
change you're asking for if you because
 
01:23:01.790 --> 01:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
if you remove the word failed it just
 
01:23:04.030 --> 01:23:04.040 align:start position:0%
reads the measures to Halt the spread of
 
01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:05.550 align:start position:0%
reads the measures to Halt the spread of
the

01:23:05.550 --> 01:23:05.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:23:09.870 --> 01:23:09.880 align:start position:0%
disease uh represent belt uh weary sorry
 
01:23:11.629 --> 01:23:11.639 align:start position:0%
uh may I
 
01:23:15.790 --> 01:23:15.800 align:start position:0%
suggest uh the measures did not halt the
 
01:23:17.310 --> 01:23:17.320 align:start position:0%
spread of the
 
01:23:21.070 --> 01:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
disease just that did not R would
 
01:23:23.510 --> 01:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
replace represented a substantial
 
01:23:35.070 --> 01:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:39.790 --> 01:23:39.800 align:start position:0%
exactly we on page 14 are we looking at
 
01:23:44.830 --> 01:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
so we're on the old page 15 old page 15
 
01:23:47.950 --> 01:23:47.960 align:start position:0%
oh yeah second second paragraph
 
01:23:52.030 --> 01:23:52.040 align:start position:0%
down sorry I wasn't there sorry yes so
 
01:23:53.830 --> 01:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
it would Now read any reasonable
 
01:23:56.030 --> 01:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
analysis of the efficacy of the measures
 
01:23:59.430 --> 01:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
taken must find that cumulatively the
 
01:24:10.910 --> 01:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:14.790 --> 01:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
disease any other changes on
 
01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
15 no
 
01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:23.310 align:start position:0%
15 no
okay

01:24:23.310 --> 01:24:23.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:15.189 --> 01:25:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:17.910 --> 01:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
any any changes to
 
01:25:25.109 --> 01:25:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:43.629 --> 01:25:43.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:47.149 --> 01:25:47.159 align:start position:0%
no representative weie uh on the old
 
01:25:50.669 --> 01:25:50.679 align:start position:0%
page 17 on the paragraph that starts out
 
01:25:55.030 --> 01:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
on the other hand okay okay uh I think
 
01:25:58.910 --> 01:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
the middle sentence has perhaps an
 
01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
extra word let's see the econ it's the
 
01:26:03.550 --> 01:26:03.560 align:start position:0%
economic impact should have been
 
01:26:06.270 --> 01:26:06.280 align:start position:0%
considered excessive long before such
 
01:26:08.590 --> 01:26:08.600 align:start position:0%
measures were suspended and the course
 
01:26:12.270 --> 01:26:12.280 align:start position:0%
of government actions changed I think I
 
01:26:15.590 --> 01:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
think the word was is Superfluous there
 
01:26:40.870 --> 01:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:44.390 --> 01:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
what representative weary and in the
 
01:26:47.310 --> 01:26:47.320 align:start position:0%
sentence below that um which starts out
 
01:26:49.310 --> 01:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
accordingly government must be assigned
 
01:26:55.350 --> 01:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
to you know um to remove the
 
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
um in the very
 
01:27:00.910 --> 01:27:00.920 align:start position:0%
last phrase of the sentence even if some
 
01:27:03.950 --> 01:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
measure caused by the initial actions
 
01:27:07.790 --> 01:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
can be justified so just remove of it
 
01:27:10.430 --> 01:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
sorry to be so word smiy here
 
01:27:16.350 --> 01:27:16.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:24.310 --> 01:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:25.709 --> 01:27:25.719 align:start position:0%
yeah I think one little piece that's
 
01:27:27.750 --> 01:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
missing here that's
 
01:27:30.990 --> 01:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
um so the economic impact should have
 
01:27:33.189 --> 01:27:33.199 align:start position:0%
been considered excessive long before
 
01:27:35.030 --> 01:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
such measures were
 
01:27:37.550 --> 01:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
suspended and the course of government
 
01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:39.350 align:start position:0%
suspended and the course of government
actions

01:27:39.350 --> 01:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
actions
 
01:27:41.709 --> 01:27:41.719 align:start position:0%
changed I think we're missing something
 
01:27:47.350 --> 01:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:50.470 --> 01:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
where like I know there's questions
 
01:27:53.229 --> 01:27:53.239 align:start position:0%
above where it's like why you know why
 
01:27:56.590 --> 01:27:56.600 align:start position:0%
didn't we pivot um we knew data some
 
01:27:59.070 --> 01:27:59.080 align:start position:0%
data that we knew for a long time
 
01:28:01.950 --> 01:28:01.960 align:start position:0%
especially if you want to call about the
 
01:28:04.910 --> 01:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
um with people in the nursing homes and
 
01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
and keeping um our elderly in isolation
 
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
um and we did not pivot and I just feel
 
01:28:14.350 --> 01:28:14.360 align:start position:0%
as if there needs to be something saying
 
01:28:17.910 --> 01:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
in there that um why why didn't we pivot
 
01:28:21.669 --> 01:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
when we when we knew I I don't know
 
01:28:23.870 --> 01:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
something here that just it's not strong
 
01:28:25.830 --> 01:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
enough for me in that one paragraph that
 
01:28:28.310 --> 01:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
I think needs to to
 
01:28:31.750 --> 01:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
say okay represent po
 
01:28:35.149 --> 01:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
off uh I I agree with your intention but
 
01:28:37.229 --> 01:28:37.239 align:start position:0%
I think it would be the previous chapter
 
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about disrupture to
 
01:28:44.390 --> 01:28:44.400 align:start position:0%
individuals uh and representative
 
01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:46.470 align:start position:0%
individuals uh and representative
weary

01:28:46.470 --> 01:28:46.480 align:start position:0%
weary
 
01:28:48.910 --> 01:28:48.920 align:start position:0%
uh at at the risk of playing
 
01:28:52.030 --> 01:28:52.040 align:start position:0%
psychologist which is not my expertise
 
01:28:56.709 --> 01:28:56.719 align:start position:0%
but is uh my late father 's expertise um
 
01:28:58.149 --> 01:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
I I think
 
01:28:58.159 --> 01:29:00.030 align:start position:0%
I I think
really

01:29:00.030 --> 01:29:00.040 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:29:05.390 --> 01:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
um fear played a large role in in
 
01:29:10.709 --> 01:29:10.719 align:start position:0%
the reluctance to make changes to
 
01:29:16.950 --> 01:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
the initial measures being taken I um at
 
01:29:20.510 --> 01:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
least at some level and I think
 
01:29:23.550 --> 01:29:23.560 align:start position:0%
that there was a paralysis that occurred
 
01:29:28.229 --> 01:29:28.239 align:start position:0%
because of that fear and I think what we
 
01:29:31.270 --> 01:29:31.280 align:start position:0%
especially as representatives of the
 
01:29:33.550 --> 01:29:33.560 align:start position:0%
people have to look at
 
01:29:38.109 --> 01:29:38.119 align:start position:0%
is is we we cannot
 
01:29:42.070 --> 01:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
let fear be the driver in these in our
 
01:29:46.149 --> 01:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
decision making so um again I I think we
 
01:29:48.870 --> 01:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
do touch upon that elsewhere in the
 
01:29:53.070 --> 01:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
report um but I think I think if if
 
01:29:55.750 --> 01:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
we're mentioning
 
01:29:57.669 --> 01:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
why this occurred or why things didn't
 
01:30:01.350 --> 01:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
occur I think that is uh one of the
 
01:30:05.830 --> 01:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
major factors that that caused people to
 
01:30:09.550 --> 01:30:09.560 align:start position:0%
to continue on that main course without
 
01:30:12.030 --> 01:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
or that initial course without
 
01:30:14.550 --> 01:30:14.560 align:start position:0%
variation I agree with you I mean one of
 
01:30:17.070 --> 01:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
the things that we discussed at length
 
01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:18.149 align:start position:0%
the things that we discussed at length
and

01:30:18.149 --> 01:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:30:20.590 --> 01:30:20.600 align:start position:0%
that uh the majority of the members of
 
01:30:25.229 --> 01:30:25.239 align:start position:0%
this committee uh had um are agreed upon
 
01:30:28.030 --> 01:30:28.040 align:start position:0%
uh bipartisanly is fear played an
 
01:30:31.830 --> 01:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
important factor in the entire pandemic
 
01:30:36.070 --> 01:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
um and that is something that as we
 
01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
discussed we're going to be dealing with
 
01:30:41.310 --> 01:30:41.320 align:start position:0%
for generations to come um The Fear
 
01:30:46.750 --> 01:30:46.760 align:start position:0%
Factor from this pandemic and um so uh
 
01:30:48.790 --> 01:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
represent PO is
 
01:30:53.310 --> 01:30:53.320 align:start position:0%
off so in last paragraph second sentence
 
01:30:56.070 --> 01:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
planning must be subject to ongoing
 
01:30:58.990 --> 01:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
review do you want to include something
 
01:31:06.910 --> 01:31:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:10.189 --> 01:31:10.199 align:start position:0%
sentence like in the face of Imagine
 
01:31:14.950 --> 01:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
real time evidence and uh and fear uh
 
01:31:20.350 --> 01:31:20.360 align:start position:0%
it's uh old page 17 last paragraph uh
 
01:31:23.669 --> 01:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
second second sentence uh planning must
 
01:31:23.679 --> 01:31:24.830 align:start position:0%
second second sentence uh planning must
be

01:31:24.830 --> 01:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:31:27.350 --> 01:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
subject to ongoing review and
 
01:31:29.709 --> 01:31:29.719 align:start position:0%
reevaluation in the
 
01:31:34.350 --> 01:31:34.360 align:start position:0%
face of fear and emerging real time
 
01:31:37.070 --> 01:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
evidence would it help if you include
 
01:31:39.470 --> 01:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
the word fear in that
 
01:31:43.070 --> 01:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
sentence okay uh represent Belcher thank
 
01:31:45.270 --> 01:31:45.280 align:start position:0%
you madam chair I I was taking to Heart
 
01:31:48.430 --> 01:31:48.440 align:start position:0%
the bit of in incompleteness of that
 
01:31:49.709 --> 01:31:49.719 align:start position:0%
sentence so I've reworked a little bit
 
01:31:50.830 --> 01:31:50.840 align:start position:0%
I'd like to read it the committee to see
 
01:31:52.350 --> 01:31:52.360 align:start position:0%
if it's something appropriate which
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
sentence are we talking about middle of
 
01:31:55.229 --> 01:31:55.239 align:start position:0%
the paragraph and I just read the whole
 
01:31:56.550 --> 01:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
paragraph It's not that long starting
 
01:31:59.430 --> 01:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
with on the other hand on the other hand
 
01:32:00.669 --> 01:32:00.679 align:start position:0%
if we recognize that the actual
 
01:32:02.229 --> 01:32:02.239 align:start position:0%
mortality rate was Far lower than
 
01:32:03.910 --> 01:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
initially estimated and that attempts to
 
01:32:05.870 --> 01:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
mitigate the spread were failing why
 
01:32:07.350 --> 01:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
were the measures that caused such an
 
01:32:09.750 --> 01:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
economic disruption allowed to continue
 
01:32:11.470 --> 01:32:11.480 align:start position:0%
the economic impact should have been
 
01:32:13.270 --> 01:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
considered excessive in light of the
 
01:32:15.950 --> 01:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
clear inefficacy of these measures these
 
01:32:17.510 --> 01:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
measures ought to have been reconsidered
 
01:32:19.669 --> 01:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
long before they were suspended and the
 
01:32:21.350 --> 01:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
course of government actions changed
 
01:32:23.990 --> 01:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
much earlier accordingly the government
 
01:32:25.550 --> 01:32:25.560 align:start position:0%
must be assigned a substantial portion
 
01:32:27.430 --> 01:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
of the blame for Unnecessary economic
 
01:32:28.870 --> 01:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
disruption During the period under the
 
01:32:31.310 --> 01:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
review even if some of the measure
 
01:32:35.910 --> 01:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:38.149 --> 01:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
justified uh represent
 
01:32:44.350 --> 01:32:44.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
no so thoughts on what representative
 
01:32:51.470 --> 01:32:51.480 align:start position:0%
beler just said perfect uh represent
 
01:32:53.109 --> 01:32:53.119 align:start position:0%
weary could you could you just read the
 
01:32:57.709 --> 01:32:57.719 align:start position:0%
last sentence again again please sure uh
 
01:32:58.990 --> 01:32:59.000 align:start position:0%
accordingly the government must be
 
01:33:00.750 --> 01:33:00.760 align:start position:0%
assigned a substantial portion of blame
 
01:33:02.430 --> 01:33:02.440 align:start position:0%
for Unnecessary augment disruption
 
01:33:04.590 --> 01:33:04.600 align:start position:0%
During the period under review even if
 
01:33:06.189 --> 01:33:06.199 align:start position:0%
some measure caused by initial actions
 
01:33:07.669 --> 01:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
can be justified I didn't actually
 
01:33:10.510 --> 01:33:10.520 align:start position:0%
change that sentence at
 
01:33:16.550 --> 01:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:18.310 align:start position:0%
 
discussion

01:33:18.310 --> 01:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:33:21.189 --> 01:33:21.199 align:start position:0%
okay and uh representative P off you
 
01:33:24.629 --> 01:33:24.639 align:start position:0%
wanted uh on the following paragraph
 
01:33:26.750 --> 01:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh second sentence you wanted uh the
 
01:33:28.669 --> 01:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
word Fair put in there planning must be
 
01:33:31.350 --> 01:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
subject to ongoing review in
 
01:33:35.350 --> 01:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
reevaluation in the face of fear and of
 
01:33:37.310 --> 01:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
emerging realtime evidence is that what
 
01:33:39.950 --> 01:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
you were trying to say represent PS off
 
01:33:42.109 --> 01:33:42.119 align:start position:0%
yes and I want to ask representative
 
01:33:45.390 --> 01:33:45.400 align:start position:0%
where if it aligns with what he wanted
 
01:33:49.750 --> 01:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:54.070 --> 01:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
Fair per please uh if I may Madam chair
 
01:33:57.430 --> 01:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh may I suggest that we insert a
 
01:34:00.350 --> 01:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
sentence in there about that fear aspect
 
01:34:04.030 --> 01:34:04.040 align:start position:0%
is that um so uh it would it would still
 
01:34:05.550 --> 01:34:05.560 align:start position:0%
remain planning must be subject to
 
01:34:07.229 --> 01:34:07.239 align:start position:0%
ongoing review and evaluation in the
 
01:34:09.629 --> 01:34:09.639 align:start position:0%
face of emerging real-time
 
01:34:15.550 --> 01:34:15.560 align:start position:0%
evidence and and a priority must be made
 
01:34:17.430 --> 01:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
on uh
 
01:34:20.550 --> 01:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
providing uh practical solutions that
 
01:34:22.590 --> 01:34:22.600 align:start position:0%
that assuage or
 
01:34:26.189 --> 01:34:26.199 align:start position:0%
diminish uh uh ongoing fear by the
 
01:34:27.990 --> 01:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
public or something along those lines
 
01:34:32.590 --> 01:34:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:34.870 align:start position:0%
 
really

01:34:34.870 --> 01:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:34:37.830 --> 01:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
that I I believe one of our speakers
 
01:34:39.990 --> 01:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
talked about a dual virus the virus of
 
01:34:42.709 --> 01:34:42.719 align:start position:0%
fear and the virus of the pandemic and I
 
01:34:45.030 --> 01:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
think it's important
 
01:34:48.709 --> 01:34:48.719 align:start position:0%
for um for us
 
01:34:51.669 --> 01:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
to I think I do think we deal with that
 
01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in the report but I think
 
01:34:55.709 --> 01:34:55.719 align:start position:0%
think it might be worthwhile introducing
 
01:34:58.109 --> 01:34:58.119 align:start position:0%
here as represent POF
 
01:35:00.830 --> 01:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
said represent beler thank you madam
 
01:35:03.750 --> 01:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
chair if I might take a stab at making a
 
01:35:06.709 --> 01:35:06.719 align:start position:0%
modification uh with that input reading
 
01:35:08.669 --> 01:35:08.679 align:start position:0%
uh starting with the word
 
01:35:10.910 --> 01:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
planning planning must be subject to
 
01:35:13.270 --> 01:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
ongoing review and re-evaluation in the
 
01:35:15.669 --> 01:35:15.679 align:start position:0%
face of emerging real-time evidence and
 
01:35:21.830 --> 01:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:24.350 --> 01:35:24.360 align:start position:0%
occurring represent weary
 
01:35:31.550 --> 01:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:34.830 --> 01:35:34.840 align:start position:0%
um it it's more than just the rhetoric
 
01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:38.070 align:start position:0%
um it it's more than just the rhetoric
right

01:35:38.070 --> 01:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:43.750 --> 01:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:46.270 --> 01:35:46.280 align:start position:0%
it's I mean I mean
 
01:35:49.149 --> 01:35:49.159 align:start position:0%
there's the I I think officials have a
 
01:35:52.109 --> 01:35:52.119 align:start position:0%
fear of of if they don't take the right
 
01:35:53.910 --> 01:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
actions they will be responsible for a
 
01:35:56.310 --> 01:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
multitude of deaths I think I think we
 
01:35:57.830 --> 01:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
did touch upon that elsewhere in the
 
01:36:01.470 --> 01:36:01.480 align:start position:0%
report but I think it's it's
 
01:36:06.430 --> 01:36:06.440 align:start position:0%
the it's a multitude of of fear factors
 
01:36:10.270 --> 01:36:10.280 align:start position:0%
not to sound like a TV show but um but
 
01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:12.470 align:start position:0%
not to sound like a TV show but um but
it

01:36:12.470 --> 01:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:15.950 align:start position:0%
it
is

01:36:15.950 --> 01:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:17.990 align:start position:0%
 
it's

01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:36:21.830 --> 01:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
it's and fear often comes from having un
 
01:36:24.189 --> 01:36:24.199 align:start position:0%
unknown data about a situ
 
01:36:26.790 --> 01:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
situation there there is panic because
 
01:36:28.790 --> 01:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
people don't know what's happening and
 
01:36:31.430 --> 01:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
they are worried about their survival
 
01:36:35.229 --> 01:36:35.239 align:start position:0%
and so I think
 
01:36:35.239 --> 01:36:36.950 align:start position:0%
and so I think
if

01:36:36.950 --> 01:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:36:39.270 --> 01:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
if I'm I'm not quite I'm struggling
 
01:36:40.550 --> 01:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
because I'm not quite sure how to fix
 
01:36:41.870 --> 01:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
that but I think it's more than just
 
01:36:44.149 --> 01:36:44.159 align:start position:0%
rhetoric right so so I'm just going to
 
01:36:45.590 --> 01:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
I'm going to throw something out because
 
01:36:47.590 --> 01:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
it was really interesting I went to a
 
01:36:50.390 --> 01:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
course in
 
01:36:54.910 --> 01:36:54.920 align:start position:0%
uh in August and they brought up um a
 
01:36:57.910 --> 01:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
very tragic event that happened and it
 
01:37:01.229 --> 01:37:01.239 align:start position:0%
was when the uh space shuttle with Chris
 
01:37:05.950 --> 01:37:05.960 align:start position:0%
moli went up into space and that launch
 
01:37:09.189 --> 01:37:09.199 align:start position:0%
had been delayed several times and in
 
01:37:11.350 --> 01:37:11.360 align:start position:0%
the room to make that decision to make
 
01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:12.149 align:start position:0%
the room to make that decision to make
that

01:37:12.149 --> 01:37:12.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:37:14.950 --> 01:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
launch the engineers were there saying
 
01:37:17.350 --> 01:37:17.360 align:start position:0%
if you do this this is going to happen
 
01:37:18.709 --> 01:37:18.719 align:start position:0%
because of the
 
01:37:21.910 --> 01:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
temperature because something within the
 
01:37:23.189 --> 01:37:23.199 align:start position:0%
shuttle couldn't withstand the
 
01:37:24.709 --> 01:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
temperature temperature was too
 
01:37:28.750 --> 01:37:28.760 align:start position:0%
cold and the executives in the room
 
01:37:30.830 --> 01:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
weren't listening to those Engineers who
 
01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:32.189 align:start position:0%
weren't listening to those Engineers who
actually

01:37:32.189 --> 01:37:32.199 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:37:34.990 --> 01:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
understood and they were fearful that
 
01:37:36.669 --> 01:37:36.679 align:start position:0%
the executive wasn't going to listen to
 
01:37:39.149 --> 01:37:39.159 align:start position:0%
them and the EXE the people making those
 
01:37:42.229 --> 01:37:42.239 align:start position:0%
decisions their bosses were fearful
 
01:37:44.990 --> 01:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
because another delayed launch how would
 
01:37:48.750 --> 01:37:48.760 align:start position:0%
that look so they launched and we know
 
01:37:55.629 --> 01:37:55.639 align:start position:0%
what happened it so you have two
 
01:37:59.589 --> 01:37:59.599 align:start position:0%
competing um arguments going on right
 
01:38:02.510 --> 01:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
what is right and what are we afraid of
 
01:38:06.589 --> 01:38:06.599 align:start position:0%
if we don't act and if we do act what's
 
01:38:06.599 --> 01:38:07.390 align:start position:0%
if we don't act and if we do act what's
the

01:38:07.390 --> 01:38:07.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:38:11.990 --> 01:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
consequences and so we have to
 
01:38:15.070 --> 01:38:15.080 align:start position:0%
understand that people have pressure on
 
01:38:17.870 --> 01:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
them so that is really where their fear
 
01:38:20.149 --> 01:38:20.159 align:start position:0%
comes in so the executives were afraid
 
01:38:22.950 --> 01:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
that if they delayed another launch what
 
01:38:25.310 --> 01:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
how is that going to look the
 
01:38:28.870 --> 01:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
engineers knew were deathly afraid of
 
01:38:32.149 --> 01:38:32.159 align:start position:0%
what was going to happen so so you so so
 
01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
you have competing fears going on there
 
01:38:39.709 --> 01:38:39.719 align:start position:0%
and I think that you know when I learned
 
01:38:43.350 --> 01:38:43.360 align:start position:0%
about you know watch this in a in a film
 
01:38:47.149 --> 01:38:47.159 align:start position:0%
and you know really saw it in action it
 
01:38:50.510 --> 01:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
really is a good example of competing
 
01:38:52.270 --> 01:38:52.280 align:start position:0%
fear arguments of
 
01:38:55.470 --> 01:38:55.480 align:start position:0%
fear but but what happened was and and
 
01:38:57.350 --> 01:38:57.360 align:start position:0%
this is I think what we found out in the
 
01:39:00.109 --> 01:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
course of our committee hearings is that
 
01:39:02.149 --> 01:39:02.159 align:start position:0%
the executive or the people in charge
 
01:39:06.189 --> 01:39:06.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:11.189 --> 01:39:11.199 align:start position:0%
trenches and that there is a perfect an
 
01:39:14.390 --> 01:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
example the tragic event that happened
 
01:39:15.910 --> 01:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
was because they didn't listen to the
 
01:39:18.430 --> 01:39:18.440 align:start position:0%
people that understood the mechanics and
 
01:39:19.550 --> 01:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
were in the
 
01:39:23.030 --> 01:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
no represent beler thank you madam chair
 
01:39:24.629 --> 01:39:24.639 align:start position:0%
and with all of that input I'd like to
 
01:39:26.790 --> 01:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
take another read of a modification to
 
01:39:29.589 --> 01:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
see if this suits uh the committee
 
01:39:31.270 --> 01:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
beginning with the word
 
01:39:33.629 --> 01:39:33.639 align:start position:0%
planning planning must be subject to
 
01:39:36.149 --> 01:39:36.159 align:start position:0%
ongoing review re-evaluation and
 
01:39:38.229 --> 01:39:38.239 align:start position:0%
continued justification in the face of
 
01:39:40.750 --> 01:39:40.760 align:start position:0%
emerging real-time evidence and in spite
 
01:39:42.910 --> 01:39:42.920 align:start position:0%
of any fear on the part of officials or
 
01:40:00.430 --> 01:40:00.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:04.270 --> 01:40:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:08.830 --> 01:40:08.840 align:start position:0%
um So based on Madam chair's earlier
 
01:40:12.109 --> 01:40:12.119 align:start position:0%
statements there's two there's like at
 
01:40:14.669 --> 01:40:14.679 align:start position:0%
least two fears going on there's a fear
 
01:40:16.589 --> 01:40:16.599 align:start position:0%
of public
 
01:40:19.830 --> 01:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
opinion by mostly by
 
01:40:22.870 --> 01:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
officials but and then there's a fear of
 
01:40:26.470 --> 01:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
s of not surviving due to the
 
01:40:28.990 --> 01:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
circumstances of the
 
01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
circumstances of the
pandemic

01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:30.050 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
01:40:30.050 --> 01:40:31.950 align:start position:0%
pandemic
[Music]

01:40:31.950 --> 01:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:40:36.550 --> 01:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
um are does that sentence capture
 
01:40:39.350 --> 01:40:39.360 align:start position:0%
that represent p is
 
01:40:44.030 --> 01:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
off um I I like um the suggestion but I
 
01:40:47.070 --> 01:40:47.080 align:start position:0%
would change in spite of any
 
01:40:52.910 --> 01:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
fear uh to not be blinded by by fear uh
 
01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:54.149 align:start position:0%
fear uh to not be blinded by by fear uh
because

01:40:54.149 --> 01:40:54.159 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:40:57.229 --> 01:40:57.239 align:start position:0%
fear can have some reasonable elements
 
01:41:01.149 --> 01:41:01.159 align:start position:0%
in it but it's important not to be fully
 
01:41:04.149 --> 01:41:04.159 align:start position:0%
Carried Away by fear I I actually like
 
01:41:52.510 --> 01:41:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:54.629 --> 01:41:54.639 align:start position:0%
uh represent please okay if I may want
 
01:41:55.709 --> 01:41:55.719 align:start position:0%
take another attempt starting at the
 
01:41:58.310 --> 01:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
word planning planning must be subject
 
01:42:00.550 --> 01:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
to ongoing review re-evaluation and
 
01:42:02.270 --> 01:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
continued justification in the face of
 
01:42:04.629 --> 01:42:04.639 align:start position:0%
emerging real-time evidence and such
 
01:42:06.669 --> 01:42:06.679 align:start position:0%
considerations must not be blinded by
 
01:42:08.790 --> 01:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
any fearfulness on the part of public
 
01:42:10.709 --> 01:42:10.719 align:start position:0%
officials I'm sorry are the part of
 
01:42:14.510 --> 01:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:17.589 --> 01:42:17.599 align:start position:0%
public any suggestions of any comments
 
01:42:20.750 --> 01:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
or is everyone good with that I can see
 
01:42:25.950 --> 01:42:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:34.229 --> 01:42:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:37.629 --> 01:42:37.639 align:start position:0%
um uh could we throw in the word undo
 
01:42:40.189 --> 01:42:40.199 align:start position:0%
because I want to recognize that that
 
01:42:42.629 --> 01:42:42.639 align:start position:0%
some of that fear is as representative
 
01:42:46.709 --> 01:42:46.719 align:start position:0%
poov said is legitimate but there is a
 
01:42:49.229 --> 01:42:49.239 align:start position:0%
point Beyond which it
 
01:42:51.589 --> 01:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
exceeds perhaps what is reasonable so if
 
01:42:53.669 --> 01:42:53.679 align:start position:0%
you could insert undo
 
01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
at some point perhaps or something like
 
01:42:58.189 --> 01:42:58.199 align:start position:0%
that if if I may just on that particular
 
01:42:59.589 --> 01:42:59.599 align:start position:0%
one I'm not sure that's a sentiment we
 
01:43:01.149 --> 01:43:01.159 align:start position:0%
want to be expressing because it would
 
01:43:02.470 --> 01:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
suggest that there's a certain point
 
01:43:18.790 --> 01:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:21.070 --> 01:43:21.080 align:start position:0%

particular line on page
 
01:51:34.560 --> 01:51:36.270 align:start position:0%
particular line on page

01:51:39.669 --> 01:51:39.679 align:start position:0%
um representative belg Madam chair yes
 
01:51:42.310 --> 01:51:42.320 align:start position:0%
uh beginning with the word planning
 
01:51:43.830 --> 01:51:43.840 align:start position:0%
planning must be subject to ongoing
 
01:51:45.790 --> 01:51:45.800 align:start position:0%
review re-evaluation and continued
 
01:51:47.350 --> 01:51:47.360 align:start position:0%
justification in the face of emerging
 
01:51:49.870 --> 01:51:49.880 align:start position:0%
real-time evidence period such
 
01:51:51.830 --> 01:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
considerations must not be blinded by
 
01:51:53.310 --> 01:51:53.320 align:start position:0%
fear as especially from government
 
01:51:56.790 --> 01:51:56.800 align:start position:0%
officials fearful of public opinion
 
01:51:59.149 --> 01:51:59.159 align:start position:0%
period thank you for that any discussion
 
01:52:03.550 --> 01:52:03.560 align:start position:0%
on that change no okay uh anything else
 
01:52:03.560 --> 01:52:04.709 align:start position:0%
on that change no okay uh anything else
on

01:52:04.709 --> 01:52:04.719 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:52:07.589 --> 01:52:07.599 align:start position:0%
17 anything none let's go to
 
01:52:31.870 --> 01:52:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:33.750 --> 01:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher thank you madam chair
 
01:52:36.109 --> 01:52:36.119 align:start position:0%
just a minor change I would recommend is
 
01:52:37.709 --> 01:52:37.719 align:start position:0%
uh in the parenthesis in the first
 
01:52:40.030 --> 01:52:40.040 align:start position:0%
paragraph says which probably caused
 
01:52:41.950 --> 01:52:41.960 align:start position:0%
harm I think we can reasonably remove
 
01:52:43.470 --> 01:52:43.480 align:start position:0%
the word probably I think it's been
 
01:52:45.550 --> 01:52:45.560 align:start position:0%
demonstrated that there was harm
 
01:52:48.350 --> 01:52:48.360 align:start position:0%
expressed by such parents um I don't
 
01:52:50.350 --> 01:52:50.360 align:start position:0%
think we have to quantify a specific
 
01:52:52.950 --> 01:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
amount to to get rid of that
 
01:52:54.709 --> 01:52:54.719 align:start position:0%
okay I have no objections to that
 
01:52:57.510 --> 01:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
01:52:59.990 --> 01:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that
 
01:53:21.430 --> 01:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:23.310 --> 01:53:23.320 align:start position:0%
18 page
 
01:54:13.069 --> 01:54:13.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:14.870 --> 01:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
is everyone okay with page
 
01:54:19.390 --> 01:54:19.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:24.629 --> 01:54:24.639 align:start position:0%
easy okay okay page 21 uh is a new topic
 
01:54:30.470 --> 01:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:33.910 --> 01:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
minute in on page 21 represent belter I
 
01:54:35.390 --> 01:54:35.400 align:start position:0%
would take out the word very in the
 
01:54:55.030 --> 01:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:57.310 --> 01:54:57.320 align:start position:0%
represent P
 
01:55:01.149 --> 01:55:01.159 align:start position:0%
off uh can we go back to page
 
01:55:04.149 --> 01:55:04.159 align:start position:0%
19 the paragraph on the bottom that
 
01:55:06.030 --> 01:55:06.040 align:start position:0%
starts with
 
01:55:09.830 --> 01:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
significant and second
 
01:55:13.069 --> 01:55:13.079 align:start position:0%
sentence the spread of long established
 
01:55:17.030 --> 01:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
pathogens such as the cold and flu virus
 
01:55:19.030 --> 01:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
I wonder if the word virus should be
 
01:55:19.040 --> 01:55:20.629 align:start position:0%
I wonder if the word virus should be
plural

01:55:20.629 --> 01:55:20.639 align:start position:0%
plural
 
01:55:26.109 --> 01:55:26.119 align:start position:0%
here like the cult and flu viruses or
 
01:55:27.750 --> 01:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
should we just take out the word flu and
 
01:55:35.390 --> 01:55:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:38.870 --> 01:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
viruses okay thank
 
01:55:51.229 --> 01:55:51.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:43.390 --> 01:56:43.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:45.270 --> 01:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
representative Belair thank you madam
 
01:56:46.830 --> 01:56:46.840 align:start position:0%
chair I think it's probably going to be
 
01:56:49.189 --> 01:56:49.199 align:start position:0%
on page maybe the beginning of page 22
 
01:56:50.550 --> 01:56:50.560 align:start position:0%
for you because I'm still working on the
 
01:56:53.189 --> 01:56:53.199 align:start position:0%
edited document um
 
01:56:56.149 --> 01:56:56.159 align:start position:0%
um paragraph starts with as mentioned
 
01:56:56.159 --> 01:56:57.750 align:start position:0%
um paragraph starts with as mentioned
previously

01:56:57.750 --> 01:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
previously
 
01:57:00.870 --> 01:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
comma that's at the bottom of page 21
 
01:57:04.350 --> 01:57:04.360 align:start position:0%
okay uh down where it says it's like
 
01:57:07.750 --> 01:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
near the end of it it says um the state
 
01:57:09.550 --> 01:57:09.560 align:start position:0%
executive branch to direct their own
 
01:57:11.229 --> 01:57:11.239 align:start position:0%
branch of government through their own
 
01:57:13.109 --> 01:57:13.119 align:start position:0%
uh constitutionally draw executive
 
01:57:16.149 --> 01:57:16.159 align:start position:0%
Authority um I
 
01:57:20.149 --> 01:57:20.159 align:start position:0%
think the word Branch after executive is
 
01:57:22.189 --> 01:57:22.199 align:start position:0%
actually um unnecessary and confusing
 
01:57:25.470 --> 01:57:25.480 align:start position:0%
using in this context um because it's
 
01:57:27.109 --> 01:57:27.119 align:start position:0%
referring to the
 
01:57:30.149 --> 01:57:30.159 align:start position:0%
executive I would agree with
 
01:57:49.830 --> 01:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:52.390 --> 01:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
you so do you think branch in the
 
01:57:55.589 --> 01:57:55.599 align:start position:0%
sentence is okay though uh for that I'm
 
01:58:01.910 --> 01:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:05.390 --> 01:58:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:07.870 --> 01:58:07.880 align:start position:0%
do any other changes on
 
01:58:12.270 --> 01:58:12.280 align:start position:0%
21 represent weary
 
01:58:17.109 --> 01:58:17.119 align:start position:0%
uh do we need uh again pick on word
 
01:58:20.030 --> 01:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
smithing a federal hyphen appointed and
 
01:58:24.669 --> 01:58:24.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:27.629 --> 01:58:27.639 align:start position:0%
where are you uh first sentence on the
 
01:58:30.270 --> 01:58:30.280 align:start position:0%
last paragraph As mentioned previously
 
01:58:31.990 --> 01:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
the existence of a chain of command
 
01:58:35.030 --> 01:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
between the federal hyphen appointed
 
01:58:37.470 --> 01:58:37.480 align:start position:0%
executive branch and the state hyphen
 
01:58:39.470 --> 01:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
appointed executive
 
01:58:43.149 --> 01:58:43.159 align:start position:0%
branch if I may represent Bel I I don't
 
01:58:44.550 --> 01:58:44.560 align:start position:0%
think that would be quite right because
 
01:58:45.669 --> 01:58:45.679 align:start position:0%
that would have that would lend the
 
01:58:47.510 --> 01:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
suggestion that it's the same executive
 
01:58:49.189 --> 01:58:49.199 align:start position:0%
branch we're talking about as opposed to
 
01:59:00.550 --> 01:59:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:02.589 --> 01:59:02.599 align:start position:0%
if I may elaborate just it if you were
 
01:59:04.870 --> 01:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
to hyphenate it it sounds it sounds like
 
01:59:06.390 --> 01:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
there's a certain part of there there
 
01:59:08.069 --> 01:59:08.079 align:start position:0%
there's some executive branch that some
 
01:59:09.550 --> 01:59:09.560 align:start position:0%
members are appointed by the state some
 
01:59:11.750 --> 01:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
are by the federal but it's actually two
 
01:59:19.550 --> 01:59:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:22.350 --> 01:59:22.360 align:start position:0%
branches if I may then uh could we could
 
01:59:26.189 --> 01:59:26.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:29.350 --> 01:59:29.360 align:start position:0%
say between the Federal Executive Branch
 
01:59:34.470 --> 01:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:37.550 --> 01:59:37.560 align:start position:0%
branch if I may uh I the only reason I
 
01:59:39.310 --> 01:59:39.320 align:start position:0%
would caution against that is because
 
01:59:41.189 --> 01:59:41.199 align:start position:0%
it's important to point out that we're
 
01:59:42.669 --> 01:59:42.679 align:start position:0%
talking about the appointed members and
 
01:59:44.950 --> 01:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
not the elected members here because it
 
01:59:46.709 --> 01:59:46.719 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it wouldn't ostensively a
 
01:59:49.669 --> 01:59:49.679 align:start position:0%
represented constitutional issue for the
 
01:59:52.390 --> 01:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
executive of the federal government to
 
01:59:54.510 --> 01:59:54.520 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation to the executive
 
01:59:55.830 --> 01:59:55.840 align:start position:0%
of the state government and for that
 
01:59:57.870 --> 01:59:57.880 align:start position:0%
executive to then decide to do that but
 
01:59:59.669 --> 01:59:59.679 align:start position:0%
coming directly from appointed officials
 
02:00:01.709 --> 02:00:01.719 align:start position:0%
of the Federal Branch to appointed
 
02:00:03.910 --> 02:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
officials of the State Branch it cuts
 
02:00:05.629 --> 02:00:05.639 align:start position:0%
out those elected members and that's I
 
02:00:10.830 --> 02:00:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:13.589 --> 02:00:13.599 align:start position:0%
make please yeah if I thank you madam
 
02:00:16.669 --> 02:00:16.679 align:start position:0%
chair then I think we need
 
02:00:20.830 --> 02:00:20.840 align:start position:0%
to clarify that that when we say
 
02:00:22.350 --> 02:00:22.360 align:start position:0%
executive branch we need the
 
02:00:22.360 --> 02:00:23.870 align:start position:0%
executive branch we need the
administrative

02:00:23.870 --> 02:00:23.880 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
02:00:25.910 --> 02:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
personnel and it's
 
02:00:32.990 --> 02:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
not it's appointed officials not elected
 
02:00:35.189 --> 02:00:35.199 align:start position:0%
officials I don't think you can do that
 
02:00:37.470 --> 02:00:37.480 align:start position:0%
because some of the people on in in
 
02:00:40.629 --> 02:00:40.639 align:start position:0%
making those decisions were
 
02:00:43.470 --> 02:00:43.480 align:start position:0%
elected because you had actually a task
 
02:00:44.870 --> 02:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
force of elected officials and
 
02:00:46.910 --> 02:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
administrative officials so you have to
 
02:00:49.550 --> 02:00:49.560 align:start position:0%
be very careful in how you were
 
02:00:52.669 --> 02:00:52.679 align:start position:0%
that because it was both
 
02:00:59.430 --> 02:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:01.990 --> 02:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
decisions so I'm open for suggestions as
 
02:01:03.660 --> 02:01:03.670 align:start position:0%
long as it it will include
 
02:01:03.670 --> 02:01:07.270 align:start position:0%
long as it it will include
[Music]

02:01:07.270 --> 02:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:09.790 --> 02:01:09.800 align:start position:0%
both represent beler thank you madam
 
02:01:11.510 --> 02:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
chair I think I can rework this to the
 
02:01:12.990 --> 02:01:13.000 align:start position:0%
satisfaction to the point that's trying
 
02:01:16.189 --> 02:01:16.199 align:start position:0%
to be made but to your point I the this
 
02:01:18.430 --> 02:01:18.440 align:start position:0%
stands alone this issue stands alone as
 
02:01:21.229 --> 02:01:21.239 align:start position:0%
a as a separate issue from that
 
02:01:22.750 --> 02:01:22.760 align:start position:0%
committee that that that you spoke of
 
02:01:25.189 --> 02:01:25.199 align:start position:0%
this is this is the existence in law of
 
02:01:29.950 --> 02:01:29.960 align:start position:0%
a direct uh order hierarchy between uh
 
02:01:31.629 --> 02:01:31.639 align:start position:0%
appointed members of the Federal
 
02:01:34.550 --> 02:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
Executive directly to appointed members
 
02:01:38.830 --> 02:01:38.840 align:start position:0%
of the state executive that authorizes
 
02:01:42.149 --> 02:01:42.159 align:start position:0%
them to take action without the input of
 
02:01:44.189 --> 02:01:44.199 align:start position:0%
the elected members of the state
 
02:01:46.870 --> 02:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
executive which is is the issue that's
 
02:01:49.229 --> 02:01:49.239 align:start position:0%
being brought up well I guess I would
 
02:01:50.790 --> 02:01:50.800 align:start position:0%
have to point out that the governor is
 
02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:53.390 align:start position:0%
have to point out that the governor is
elected

02:01:53.390 --> 02:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
elected
 
02:01:56.270 --> 02:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
yes that that is correct but within law
 
02:01:57.470 --> 02:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
this is something that came up during
 
02:01:59.149 --> 02:01:59.159 align:start position:0%
DHS testimonies that there is a
 
02:02:02.669 --> 02:02:02.679 align:start position:0%
provision in law a statute that
 
02:02:05.750 --> 02:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
authorizes the state appointed members
 
02:02:07.470 --> 02:02:07.480 align:start position:0%
of the executive to take Direction
 
02:02:10.709 --> 02:02:10.719 align:start position:0%
directly from appointed members of the
 
02:02:14.470 --> 02:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
Federal Executive so DHS directly to DHS
 
02:02:18.830 --> 02:02:18.840 align:start position:0%
without necessarily having the input of
 
02:02:22.550 --> 02:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
the governor or other or the EXE um
 
02:02:25.149 --> 02:02:25.159 align:start position:0%
counsil for that matter so it in theory
 
02:02:26.550 --> 02:02:26.560 align:start position:0%
and I'm not saying it necessarily did
 
02:02:29.470 --> 02:02:29.480 align:start position:0%
all the time but in theory it authorizes
 
02:02:32.390 --> 02:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
them to cut out those elected members
 
02:02:33.629 --> 02:02:33.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for that
 
02:02:36.950 --> 02:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
explanation um so uh you said you had a
 
02:02:38.470 --> 02:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
change that you thought would be
 
02:03:14.990 --> 02:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:16.629 --> 02:03:16.639 align:start position:0%
represent POS
 
02:03:20.750 --> 02:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
off uh I think
 
02:03:23.990 --> 02:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh I would suggest not changing this
 
02:03:26.270 --> 02:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
paragraph uh I don't know how other
 
02:03:26.280 --> 02:03:27.310 align:start position:0%
paragraph uh I don't know how other
members

02:03:27.310 --> 02:03:27.320 align:start position:0%
members
 
02:03:30.149 --> 02:03:30.159 align:start position:0%
feel represent beler thank you i' I've
 
02:03:31.750 --> 02:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
made a stylistic change just I think
 
02:03:34.550 --> 02:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
make it more clear um if if I may
 
02:03:36.310 --> 02:03:36.320 align:start position:0%
beginning with the as mentioned
 
02:03:38.669 --> 02:03:38.679 align:start position:0%
previously the existence of a chain of
 
02:03:40.510 --> 02:03:40.520 align:start position:0%
command between appointed members of the
 
02:03:42.629 --> 02:03:42.639 align:start position:0%
Federal Executive Branch directly to
 
02:03:44.310 --> 02:03:44.320 align:start position:0%
appointed members of the state executive
 
02:03:45.750 --> 02:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
branch comes with significant
 
02:03:45.760 --> 02:03:47.470 align:start position:0%
branch comes with significant
constitutional

02:03:47.470 --> 02:03:47.480 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
02:03:50.709 --> 02:03:50.719 align:start position:0%
concerns I like that change I do too
 
02:03:52.149 --> 02:03:52.159 align:start position:0%
because you just changed the word
 
02:03:53.990 --> 02:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
appointed is really and I think that
 
02:03:58.109 --> 02:03:58.119 align:start position:0%
makes it uh much clearer so thank you uh
 
02:04:01.549 --> 02:04:01.559 align:start position:0%
represent PS off any objection okay
 
02:04:42.030 --> 02:04:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:46.430 --> 02:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:14.830 --> 02:05:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:18.589 --> 02:05:18.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:50.629 --> 02:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:42.510 --> 02:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:47.910 --> 02:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:50.910 --> 02:06:50.920 align:start position:0%
um it's a runon it's a runon sentence
 
02:06:52.830 --> 02:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
we've got to either break that up or
 
02:06:54.990 --> 02:06:55.000 align:start position:0%
whatever so because it it it's got a lot
 
02:06:58.629 --> 02:06:58.639 align:start position:0%
in there it's just too much um so it
 
02:07:00.549 --> 02:07:00.559 align:start position:0%
starts off in the future decisions while
 
02:07:03.589 --> 02:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
properly considering expert opinion on
 
02:07:06.589 --> 02:07:06.599 align:start position:0%
matters you know make a statement and
 
02:07:08.149 --> 02:07:08.159 align:start position:0%
then we should finish it off that should
 
02:07:09.470 --> 02:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
be two
 
02:07:17.910 --> 02:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:22.229 --> 02:07:22.239 align:start position:0%
everybody's uh I had a weird edit there
 
02:07:26.549 --> 02:07:26.559 align:start position:0%
hold on one sec uh just to modify that
 
02:07:28.470 --> 02:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
if this is appropriate in the future
 
02:07:30.549 --> 02:07:30.559 align:start position:0%
decisions while properly considering
 
02:07:32.310 --> 02:07:32.320 align:start position:0%
expert opinions on matters ought to be
 
02:07:33.669 --> 02:07:33.679 align:start position:0%
the purview of only elected and
 
02:07:36.270 --> 02:07:36.280 align:start position:0%
accountable officials these officials
 
02:07:37.750 --> 02:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
ought to always weigh counterveiling
 
02:07:40.149 --> 02:07:40.159 align:start position:0%
considerations to emergency actions to
 
02:07:42.109 --> 02:07:42.119 align:start position:0%
and avoid the pitfalls of safetyism and
 
02:07:42.119 --> 02:07:43.669 align:start position:0%
and avoid the pitfalls of safetyism and
crafting

02:07:43.669 --> 02:07:43.679 align:start position:0%
crafting
 
02:07:46.589 --> 02:07:46.599 align:start position:0%
policy um I have a question on this
 
02:07:50.430 --> 02:07:50.440 align:start position:0%
section because we're talking about
 
02:07:52.870 --> 02:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
um critical
 
02:07:56.910 --> 02:07:56.920 align:start position:0%
capacity the roll out Etc is there
 
02:08:00.149 --> 02:08:00.159 align:start position:0%
anything in here after this section that
 
02:08:03.549 --> 02:08:03.559 align:start position:0%
talks about how nursing
 
02:08:06.830 --> 02:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
homes um were affected by the federal
 
02:08:08.430 --> 02:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
mandates of the
 
02:08:14.109 --> 02:08:14.119 align:start position:0%
dollars um that resulted in loss of um
 
02:08:17.790 --> 02:08:17.800 align:start position:0%
nursing staff um I think it's important
 
02:08:19.310 --> 02:08:19.320 align:start position:0%
somewhere I don't know if it's in here
 
02:08:22.549 --> 02:08:22.559 align:start position:0%
so that's why I'm asking because as was
 
02:08:27.030 --> 02:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
discussed in at our county level um that
 
02:08:30.830 --> 02:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
we discussed um Public Health as a
 
02:08:33.589 --> 02:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
priority with um our
 
02:08:36.709 --> 02:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
colleagues on on the other side that we
 
02:08:39.750 --> 02:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
need to be making sure that um you know
 
02:08:41.109 --> 02:08:41.119 align:start position:0%
we we have
 
02:08:41.119 --> 02:08:43.109 align:start position:0%
we we have
Staffing

02:08:43.109 --> 02:08:43.119 align:start position:0%
Staffing
 
02:08:46.830 --> 02:08:46.840 align:start position:0%
at hospitals and nursing homes Etc but
 
02:08:49.350 --> 02:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
we also know that we lost a tremendous
 
02:08:52.750 --> 02:08:52.760 align:start position:0%
amount of Staffing due to the
 
02:08:55.589 --> 02:08:55.599 align:start position:0%
mandates from the federal government not
 
02:08:56.950 --> 02:08:56.960 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:09:01.350 --> 02:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
government because if you received the I
 
02:09:04.189 --> 02:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
believe it's the Medicaid
 
02:09:06.950 --> 02:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
dollars you had to make sure you
 
02:09:11.870 --> 02:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
complied with Federal and therefore uh
 
02:09:15.830 --> 02:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
that impacted our elderly in a in a way
 
02:09:17.990 --> 02:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
that uh we can't even
 
02:09:21.069 --> 02:09:21.079 align:start position:0%
explain um so I'm just asking I know
 
02:09:23.669 --> 02:09:23.679 align:start position:0%
that if it's not included I understand
 
02:09:25.390 --> 02:09:25.400 align:start position:0%
but I just wanted to because we're
 
02:09:29.189 --> 02:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
talking about how um good things were
 
02:09:32.149 --> 02:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
but I think that is an area that was
 
02:09:34.910 --> 02:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
really important represent Belgium thank
 
02:09:37.109 --> 02:09:37.119 align:start position:0%
you madam chair I I do not believe it
 
02:09:40.310 --> 02:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
was covered in that level of specificity
 
02:09:42.109 --> 02:09:42.119 align:start position:0%
but I think what we will find is that
 
02:09:45.709 --> 02:09:45.719 align:start position:0%
there is discussion of in a more General
 
02:09:49.510 --> 02:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
sense the effect of um particularly
 
02:09:53.870 --> 02:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
Federal guidance on on the Health Care
 
02:09:56.790 --> 02:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
system thank you for that
 
02:10:00.310 --> 02:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh any other changes on
 
02:10:20.310 --> 02:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:50.229 align:start position:0%
 
on

02:10:50.229 --> 02:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:49.709 --> 02:11:49.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:53.350 --> 02:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
anything on 20 24 or
 
02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:55.229 align:start position:0%
anything on 20 24 or
25

02:11:55.229 --> 02:11:55.239 align:start position:0%
25
 
02:11:57.549 --> 02:11:57.559 align:start position:0%
nope go on to
 
02:11:57.559 --> 02:12:20.149 align:start position:0%
nope go on to
26

02:12:20.149 --> 02:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:58.430 --> 02:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:02.870 --> 02:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
on page 26 second paragraph
 
02:13:06.589 --> 02:13:06.599 align:start position:0%
um starts off efficacy propo
 
02:13:08.629 --> 02:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
professional fitted should it be
 
02:13:10.470 --> 02:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
professionally fitted
 
02:13:21.310 --> 02:13:21.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:23.990 --> 02:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
because it is my understanding that if
 
02:13:27.189 --> 02:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
you are doing have an n95 mask it must
 
02:13:30.310 --> 02:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
be professionally fitted and I don't
 
02:13:32.310 --> 02:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
think there needs to be a comma there
 
02:13:46.990 --> 02:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:49.510 --> 02:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
mask does anyone have any comments on
 
02:13:53.589 --> 02:13:53.599 align:start position:0%
that change represent weary uh you you
 
02:13:57.830 --> 02:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
can obtain masks that are in 95 I
 
02:14:00.310 --> 02:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
believe you can obtain mass that are in
 
02:14:04.910 --> 02:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:07.750 --> 02:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
fitted representative Bel that is
 
02:14:10.589 --> 02:14:10.599 align:start position:0%
correct like I can buy my own 95 Mass
 
02:14:12.189 --> 02:14:12.199 align:start position:0%
but this specific sentence is
 
02:14:14.229 --> 02:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
referencing a study that was submitted
 
02:14:16.910 --> 02:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
to this Committee in which there were
 
02:14:19.470 --> 02:14:19.480 align:start position:0%
Professional healthc Care Professionals
 
02:14:22.589 --> 02:14:22.599 align:start position:0%
utilizing fitted in 95 type masks under
 
02:14:24.589 --> 02:14:24.599 align:start position:0%
control conditions in hospitals so
 
02:14:26.830 --> 02:14:26.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's the
 
02:14:29.069 --> 02:14:29.079 align:start position:0%
context so my question is is
 
02:14:31.990 --> 02:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
professionally fitted
 
02:14:34.470 --> 02:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh what it should be or should it be
 
02:14:37.990 --> 02:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
left alone uh representative weary could
 
02:14:40.069 --> 02:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
could we just change the word
 
02:14:42.910 --> 02:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
in so the only piece of evidence
 
02:14:44.310 --> 02:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
provided to this commit is support of
 
02:14:46.430 --> 02:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
masking efficacy was a single study that
 
02:14:48.629 --> 02:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
found possible
 
02:14:51.750 --> 02:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
efficacy when purposed professional
 
02:14:55.390 --> 02:14:55.400 align:start position:0%
fitted n95 type masks were used in
 
02:14:58.549 --> 02:14:58.559 align:start position:0%
controlled conditions so just to clarify
 
02:14:59.950 --> 02:14:59.960 align:start position:0%
that because I think it's worth pointing
 
02:15:01.069 --> 02:15:01.079 align:start position:0%
out the
 
02:15:04.390 --> 02:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
study um and the
 
02:15:08.470 --> 02:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
limited data available on this but but
 
02:15:11.870 --> 02:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
to be to your to the earlier points that
 
02:15:14.830 --> 02:15:14.840 align:start position:0%
were raised um
 
02:15:18.069 --> 02:15:18.079 align:start position:0%
clarifying uh the type of mask and the
 
02:15:20.790 --> 02:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
conditions that the mask was were used
 
02:15:23.990 --> 02:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:25.910 --> 02:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
conditions could you just read that
 
02:15:28.270 --> 02:15:28.280 align:start position:0%
change to us please sure here uh
 
02:15:31.750 --> 02:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
beginning with the only the only piece
 
02:15:33.549 --> 02:15:33.559 align:start position:0%
of EV evidence provided to this
 
02:15:35.510 --> 02:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
Committee in support of masking efficacy
 
02:15:37.629 --> 02:15:37.639 align:start position:0%
was a single study that found possible
 
02:15:39.870 --> 02:15:39.880 align:start position:0%
efficacy when purposed professionally
 
02:15:42.910 --> 02:15:42.920 align:start position:0%
fitted n95 type masks were utilized
 
02:15:44.669 --> 02:15:44.679 align:start position:0%
under controlled
 
02:15:58.790 --> 02:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:58.800 --> 02:16:00.790 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:16:00.790 --> 02:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:16:07.390 --> 02:16:07.400 align:start position:0%
wey um in reviewing this um for um again
 
02:16:11.310 --> 02:16:11.320 align:start position:0%
um there's one aspect that I'm not sure
 
02:16:14.589 --> 02:16:14.599 align:start position:0%
we've addressed here that I think is
 
02:16:16.390 --> 02:16:16.400 align:start position:0%
worth while I'm not sure if it's too
 
02:16:22.910 --> 02:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:26.109 --> 02:16:26.119 align:start position:0%
there actually is an adverse reaction
 
02:16:31.030 --> 02:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
from ongoing wearing of masks from you
 
02:16:33.950 --> 02:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
know uh like homemade masks where the
 
02:16:37.629 --> 02:16:37.639 align:start position:0%
The Masks become saturated
 
02:16:37.639 --> 02:16:42.429 align:start position:0%
The Masks become saturated
with

02:16:42.429 --> 02:16:42.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:42.439 --> 02:16:45.349 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:16:45.349 --> 02:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:50.429 --> 02:16:50.439 align:start position:0%
uh bacteria and it it also has an
 
02:16:52.830 --> 02:16:52.840 align:start position:0%
ongoing effect of limiting the amount of
 
02:16:56.429 --> 02:16:56.439 align:start position:0%
oxygen that PE the wearers can draw in
 
02:16:59.030 --> 02:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
so I think there are
 
02:16:59.040 --> 02:17:01.589 align:start position:0%
so I think there are
actually

02:17:01.589 --> 02:17:01.599 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:17:04.309 --> 02:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
um May maybe there's a way when we talk
 
02:17:08.150 --> 02:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
about homemade masks uh and maybe that
 
02:17:10.750 --> 02:17:10.760 align:start position:0%
was the paragraph that that caught my
 
02:17:14.309 --> 02:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
eye that made me think of this is that
 
02:17:16.509 --> 02:17:16.519 align:start position:0%
um the
 
02:17:20.389 --> 02:17:20.399 align:start position:0%
um adverse effects from the ongoing
 
02:17:22.910 --> 02:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
where ing of homemade
 
02:17:27.110 --> 02:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
Mass um did not
 
02:17:31.389 --> 02:17:31.399 align:start position:0%
or the ongoing wearing of homemade
 
02:17:34.669 --> 02:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
Mass did not account
 
02:17:38.709 --> 02:17:38.719 align:start position:0%
for uh proper proper cleaning of the
 
02:17:42.190 --> 02:17:42.200 align:start position:0%
masks um possible contamination by
 
02:17:46.790 --> 02:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
bacteria of the masks and a
 
02:17:46.800 --> 02:17:48.549 align:start position:0%
bacteria of the masks and a
possible

02:17:48.549 --> 02:17:48.559 align:start position:0%
possible
 
02:17:51.709 --> 02:17:51.719 align:start position:0%
um lessening of oxygen intake something
 
02:17:54.309 --> 02:17:54.319 align:start position:0%
along those lines because I think those
 
02:17:57.549 --> 02:17:57.559 align:start position:0%
are uh genuine issues that that still
 
02:17:59.830 --> 02:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
persist quite frankly okay although I
 
02:18:02.150 --> 02:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
agree with you represent weary uh we
 
02:18:05.110 --> 02:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
didn't have uh data submitted to us
 
02:18:08.990 --> 02:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
regarding that um I know there was some
 
02:18:12.509 --> 02:18:12.519 align:start position:0%
discussion about um people getting
 
02:18:15.629 --> 02:18:15.639 align:start position:0%
sicker from wearing masks um and maybe
 
02:18:18.030 --> 02:18:18.040 align:start position:0%
that's one of the subjects in an ongoing
 
02:18:19.910 --> 02:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
committee that we delve into further but
 
02:18:21.429 --> 02:18:21.439 align:start position:0%
representative Belch than representative
 
02:18:23.629 --> 02:18:23.639 align:start position:0%
penzo thank you madam chair I I don't
 
02:18:25.990 --> 02:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
disagree um with representative wry
 
02:18:27.990 --> 02:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
about the it might be nice to have that
 
02:18:29.709 --> 02:18:29.719 align:start position:0%
but I do think it this point it's too
 
02:18:32.469 --> 02:18:32.479 align:start position:0%
late to get into it only because not not
 
02:18:33.709 --> 02:18:33.719 align:start position:0%
because it would be too difficult just
 
02:18:36.389 --> 02:18:36.399 align:start position:0%
to enter that sentence or paragraph but
 
02:18:39.270 --> 02:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
then to justify it a based on the
 
02:18:40.990 --> 02:18:41.000 align:start position:0%
evidentiary basis that we have on the
 
02:18:43.270 --> 02:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
record in this committee and then some
 
02:18:46.309 --> 02:18:46.319 align:start position:0%
of the complicating factors are such as
 
02:18:48.070 --> 02:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
it's a very good point that it could be
 
02:18:50.910 --> 02:18:50.920 align:start position:0%
um a problem for people who are you know
 
02:18:52.469 --> 02:18:52.479 align:start position:0%
compromis in some way but then we would
 
02:18:53.870 --> 02:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
have to go look at okay well the
 
02:18:56.830 --> 02:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
governor's order actually did exempt
 
02:18:58.629 --> 02:18:58.639 align:start position:0%
people who were immuno compromis so does
 
02:19:00.349 --> 02:19:00.359 align:start position:0%
that conflict with the statement we're
 
02:19:03.150 --> 02:19:03.160 align:start position:0%
making at this point it it's just I
 
02:19:04.589 --> 02:19:04.599 align:start position:0%
think it's a lot to try to handle at
 
02:19:06.309 --> 02:19:06.319 align:start position:0%
this very last
 
02:19:11.349 --> 02:19:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:14.270 --> 02:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
Penza if we want to
 
02:19:18.990 --> 02:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
have studies put in for the record um
 
02:19:21.950 --> 02:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
there was so the gentleman that came and
 
02:19:25.549 --> 02:19:25.559 align:start position:0%
testified and spent a long time here um
 
02:19:31.230 --> 02:19:31.240 align:start position:0%
um the expert on masks uh um Mr Petty we
 
02:19:34.389 --> 02:19:34.399 align:start position:0%
can we can add that stuff in there's
 
02:19:36.230 --> 02:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
there's many many things that he
 
02:19:41.429 --> 02:19:41.439 align:start position:0%
referenced in his um in his presentation
 
02:19:46.750 --> 02:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
that are um that were links or or um um
 
02:19:48.150 --> 02:19:48.160 align:start position:0%
what do you want to call it studies that
 
02:19:50.429 --> 02:19:50.439 align:start position:0%
were that have been done I have all of
 
02:19:54.469 --> 02:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
that information so um if you'd like I
 
02:19:56.510 --> 02:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
mean we could you know if I don't think
 
02:19:57.790 --> 02:19:57.800 align:start position:0%
we should change this but we could
 
02:20:00.550 --> 02:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
literally add a line if you wanted to to
 
02:20:03.270 --> 02:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
reference that and I will upload them
 
02:20:06.550 --> 02:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
all for um that are underneath all of
 
02:20:08.910 --> 02:20:08.920 align:start position:0%
the masking session which pretty much Mr
 
02:20:10.790 --> 02:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
Petty touched on almost every single one
 
02:20:12.830 --> 02:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
of them so it would be it's going to be
 
02:20:15.910 --> 02:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
based upon studies that have taken place
 
02:20:18.190 --> 02:20:18.200 align:start position:0%
a long time ago all the way up until
 
02:20:19.790 --> 02:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
recent ones over the last two to three
 
02:20:19.800 --> 02:20:21.389 align:start position:0%
recent ones over the last two to three
years

02:20:21.389 --> 02:20:21.399 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:20:25.030 --> 02:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
um we do have his testimony and his
 
02:20:27.510 --> 02:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
PowerPoint presentation attached to our
 
02:20:31.309 --> 02:20:31.319 align:start position:0%
website uh so um represent Belair
 
02:20:32.950 --> 02:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
representative weary thank you madam
 
02:20:34.910 --> 02:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
chair and I I I don't disagree with the
 
02:20:36.550 --> 02:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
fact that we have that testimony in the
 
02:20:38.309 --> 02:20:38.319 align:start position:0%
record I think the continued
 
02:20:40.349 --> 02:20:40.359 align:start position:0%
complication is going to be depending on
 
02:20:42.670 --> 02:20:42.680 align:start position:0%
exactly what we were trying to input we
 
02:20:45.870 --> 02:20:45.880 align:start position:0%
would still need to go back to the
 
02:20:48.830 --> 02:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
actual emergency order regarding face
 
02:20:51.710 --> 02:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
coverings and the extra ordinarily long
 
02:20:54.710 --> 02:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
list of exemptions that existed in order
 
02:20:57.830 --> 02:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
to justify what we're putting in this cu
 
02:20:59.590 --> 02:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
the trouble is clearly the private
 
02:21:01.510 --> 02:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
sector didn't realize this list of
 
02:21:02.990 --> 02:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
exemptions and all these people were
 
02:21:05.670 --> 02:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
nonetheless forced in many cases to wear
 
02:21:07.510 --> 02:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
masks even though they were technically
 
02:21:10.070 --> 02:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
Exempted under the order and so we have
 
02:21:11.349 --> 02:21:11.359 align:start position:0%
to deal with are we dealing with the
 
02:21:13.710 --> 02:21:13.720 align:start position:0%
executive order which did exempt them or
 
02:21:16.349 --> 02:21:16.359 align:start position:0%
the way that they were inforced um which
 
02:21:18.030 --> 02:21:18.040 align:start position:0%
which creates a complication as far as
 
02:21:19.389 --> 02:21:19.399 align:start position:0%
if we're going to criticize government
 
02:21:21.590 --> 02:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
policy technically it may not have been
 
02:21:21.600 --> 02:21:23.590 align:start position:0%
policy technically it may not have been
government

02:21:23.590 --> 02:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
government
 
02:21:26.309 --> 02:21:26.319 align:start position:0%
policy represent
 
02:21:30.030 --> 02:21:30.040 align:start position:0%
weary um thank you mam chair so in the
 
02:21:32.110 --> 02:21:32.120 align:start position:0%
paragraph in the third paragraph under
 
02:21:35.550 --> 02:21:35.560 align:start position:0%
the masking uh in the section we do talk
 
02:21:38.870 --> 02:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
about Exempted persons and we I think we
 
02:21:41.429 --> 02:21:41.439 align:start position:0%
we so I think that's addressed my
 
02:21:43.990 --> 02:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
suggestion would be to along with what
 
02:21:46.429 --> 02:21:46.439 align:start position:0%
representative Potenza mentioned is
 
02:21:48.750 --> 02:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
simply saying in the paragraph that
 
02:21:50.590 --> 02:21:50.600 align:start position:0%
starts out the Mandate from asking
 
02:21:53.790 --> 02:21:53.800 align:start position:0%
quickly devolved um we could we could
 
02:21:57.469 --> 02:21:57.479 align:start position:0%
say maybe have a add an additional
 
02:22:00.670 --> 02:22:00.680 align:start position:0%
sentence that says you know uh one
 
02:22:03.990 --> 02:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
expert heard by the committee testified
 
02:22:07.030 --> 02:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
about issues associated
 
02:22:11.510 --> 02:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
with um the wearing a mask and and this
 
02:22:16.030 --> 02:22:16.040 align:start position:0%
uh would bear further study
 
02:22:18.950 --> 02:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
um which bear or which Bears further
 
02:22:18.960 --> 02:22:21.030 align:start position:0%
um which bear or which Bears further
study

02:22:21.030 --> 02:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
study
 
02:22:22.670 --> 02:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
I would be acceptable with that
 
02:22:59.870 --> 02:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:59.880 --> 02:23:00.990 align:start position:0%
 
represent

02:23:00.990 --> 02:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:23:03.349 --> 02:23:03.359 align:start position:0%
beler I have an edit I can read to see
 
02:23:06.070 --> 02:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
if this is satisfactory um I'll start
 
02:23:08.790 --> 02:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
with the reality is this these face
 
02:23:10.710 --> 02:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
coverings often consist of an old cost
 
02:23:13.990 --> 02:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
cotton t-shirt or the equivalent expert
 
02:23:15.670 --> 02:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
testimony was received by this committee
 
02:23:17.469 --> 02:23:17.479 align:start position:0%
to the effect of maske wearing of this
 
02:23:19.190 --> 02:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
sort contributing toward negative
 
02:23:20.950 --> 02:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
effects including contaminating by
 
02:23:24.150 --> 02:23:24.160 align:start position:0%
bacteria and increased work of
 
02:23:28.389 --> 02:23:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:31.150 --> 02:23:31.160 align:start position:0%
suggestions represented weary would
 
02:23:33.230 --> 02:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
would the final sentence still be there
 
02:23:36.150 --> 02:23:36.160 align:start position:0%
the this committee was presented okay
 
02:23:41.590 --> 02:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
okay anybody else no good okay um moving
 
02:23:45.630 --> 02:23:45.640 align:start position:0%
on to page 27 we have uh we are getting
 
02:23:48.670 --> 02:23:48.680 align:start position:0%
down to limited time we have you know so
 
02:23:50.469 --> 02:23:50.479 align:start position:0%
I just want to throw that out there for
 
02:23:50.479 --> 02:24:32.630 align:start position:0%
I just want to throw that out there for
everyone

02:24:32.630 --> 02:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:34.750 --> 02:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
represent beler thank you just minor
 
02:24:37.150 --> 02:24:37.160 align:start position:0%
change uh I'm not sure page is 20
 
02:24:41.190 --> 02:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
probably 27 okay um this Mass mandate
 
02:24:42.469 --> 02:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
greatly infringed on the rights of
 
02:24:44.389 --> 02:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
citizens and created a Divi of a
 
02:24:46.110 --> 02:24:46.120 align:start position:0%
divisive false Paradigm I don't think
 
02:24:48.710 --> 02:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
the word uh false is necessary there
 
02:24:51.030 --> 02:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
just a divisive paradigm I think that's
 
02:24:56.150 --> 02:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:01.910 --> 02:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:05.630 --> 02:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
27 yeah I'm I'm not gonna um I'm not
 
02:25:06.870 --> 02:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
gonna we're not going to make this
 
02:25:08.830 --> 02:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
change now I just I really wish there
 
02:25:10.830 --> 02:25:10.840 align:start position:0%
was a paragraph that just like
 
02:25:13.990 --> 02:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
specifically talked about about schools
 
02:25:16.790 --> 02:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
and uh I don't feel as if that's covered
 
02:25:18.750 --> 02:25:18.760 align:start position:0%
enough but
 
02:25:20.910 --> 02:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
um I think you miss the part on
 
02:25:22.790 --> 02:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
education oh that's we went over that
 
02:25:27.990 --> 02:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:49.230 --> 02:25:49.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:49.240 --> 02:26:19.230 align:start position:0%
 
28

02:26:19.230 --> 02:26:19.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:19.240 --> 02:26:49.230 align:start position:0%
 
e

02:26:49.230 --> 02:26:49.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:42.670 --> 02:27:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:46.910 --> 02:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
any suggestions on 28 or 29 I think
 
02:27:53.150 --> 02:27:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:55.309 --> 02:27:55.319 align:start position:0%
representative weary is it too
 
02:27:59.910 --> 02:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
overreaching to say um sorry page 29
 
02:28:03.030 --> 02:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
middle paragraph starts out the specific
 
02:28:04.990 --> 02:28:05.000 align:start position:0%
emergency orders in
 
02:28:10.950 --> 02:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:13.950 --> 02:28:13.960 align:start position:0%
would I I was thinking that
 
02:28:17.190 --> 02:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
these the exercise of these Powers
 
02:28:21.349 --> 02:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
bordered on like martial law
 
02:28:23.110 --> 02:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
and I was wondering if we
 
02:28:27.190 --> 02:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
could um maybe in that middle sentence
 
02:28:29.590 --> 02:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
State something to that effect as such
 
02:28:31.710 --> 02:28:31.720 align:start position:0%
the exercise of these Powers was
 
02:28:33.510 --> 02:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
entirely a state prerogative and
 
02:28:36.670 --> 02:28:36.680 align:start position:0%
bordered on martial law is that too
 
02:28:41.590 --> 02:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
strong or is that incorrect I I just
 
02:28:43.990 --> 02:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
think representative Penza then
 
02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:47.830 align:start position:0%
think representative Penza then
representative

02:28:47.830 --> 02:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:51.710 --> 02:28:51.720 align:start position:0%
beler I agree with
 
02:28:54.389 --> 02:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
um I agree with adding something I don't
 
02:28:57.630 --> 02:28:57.640 align:start position:0%
know if we want that except for I think
 
02:28:59.990 --> 02:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
we should I think we should prefer the
 
02:29:02.510 --> 02:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
specific emergency orders there were
 
02:29:06.309 --> 02:29:06.319 align:start position:0%
literally um over a hundred executive
 
02:29:09.389 --> 02:29:09.399 align:start position:0%
and emergency orders that took place uh
 
02:29:12.710 --> 02:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
completely overreach by one branch when
 
02:29:13.950 --> 02:29:13.960 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to have three branches of
 
02:29:15.590 --> 02:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
government that are all checks and
 
02:29:18.750 --> 02:29:18.760 align:start position:0%
balances so if we can talk about if we
 
02:29:20.950 --> 02:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
can say
 
02:29:24.110 --> 02:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
severe unconstitutional overreach I
 
02:29:27.190 --> 02:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
would rather that than in regards with
 
02:29:29.269 --> 02:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
you know in saying martial
 
02:29:31.630 --> 02:29:31.640 align:start position:0%
law representative Belcher thank you
 
02:29:33.870 --> 02:29:33.880 align:start position:0%
madam chair I I would tend to agree that
 
02:29:36.070 --> 02:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
I think so when I view the idea of
 
02:29:37.830 --> 02:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
Martial law I think that that's actually
 
02:29:40.349 --> 02:29:40.359 align:start position:0%
a very specific thing it's not a general
 
02:29:41.830 --> 02:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
thing and I don't think it qualifies
 
02:29:43.750 --> 02:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
what happened but I do think maybe the
 
02:29:45.910 --> 02:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
term extra
 
02:29:48.269 --> 02:29:48.279 align:start position:0%
constitutional might be appropriate in
 
02:29:50.349 --> 02:29:50.359 align:start position:0%
that context because it it exceeds ceeds
 
02:29:53.550 --> 02:29:53.560 align:start position:0%
what is constitutionally available as
 
02:29:56.429 --> 02:29:56.439 align:start position:0%
Powers representative
 
02:29:58.309 --> 02:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
Penza for
 
02:30:01.389 --> 02:30:01.399 align:start position:0%
example uh a very good friend of mine
 
02:30:05.269 --> 02:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
was was arrested for not wearing a mask
 
02:30:08.070 --> 02:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
when she literally has a a
 
02:30:11.389 --> 02:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
medical exemption from wearing a mask
 
02:30:13.870 --> 02:30:13.880 align:start position:0%
and it didn't matter and the police
 
02:30:16.150 --> 02:30:16.160 align:start position:0%
still arrested her you know quote
 
02:30:18.910 --> 02:30:18.920 align:start position:0%
unquote following orders and so I really
 
02:30:21.269 --> 02:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
do believe that and that happened in
 
02:30:24.389 --> 02:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
many places over the state um maybe not
 
02:30:27.269 --> 02:30:27.279 align:start position:0%
as much as in other states but I think
 
02:30:29.950 --> 02:30:29.960 align:start position:0%
those types of things um have to be
 
02:30:32.870 --> 02:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
brought up here um in in in a in a
 
02:30:35.070 --> 02:30:35.080 align:start position:0%
general sense and so that's why I would
 
02:30:37.790 --> 02:30:37.800 align:start position:0%
really like it to say you know in
 
02:30:39.750 --> 02:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
regards with severe constitutional
 
02:30:42.070 --> 02:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
issues um and
 
02:30:45.349 --> 02:30:45.359 align:start position:0%
overreach and uh an unbelievable amount
 
02:30:52.269 --> 02:30:52.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:55.230 --> 02:30:55.240 align:start position:0%
okay representative Belcher Madam chair
 
02:30:57.790 --> 02:30:57.800 align:start position:0%
if I may take a shot at trying this
 
02:31:02.590 --> 02:31:02.600 align:start position:0%
amendment please the ending of the first
 
02:31:04.790 --> 02:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
paragraph in section
 
02:31:07.550 --> 02:31:07.560 align:start position:0%
c these measures were documented as
 
02:31:09.550 --> 02:31:09.560 align:start position:0%
being significantly disruptive to the
 
02:31:12.030 --> 02:31:12.040 align:start position:0%
lives of New Hampshire residents and are
 
02:31:13.590 --> 02:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
highlighted by this committee as
 
02:31:17.269 --> 02:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
apparently extra-constitutional in
 
02:31:27.990 --> 02:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:32.990 --> 02:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
any good bad no opinion representative
 
02:31:39.030 --> 02:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:42.870 --> 02:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
um I I do like the word severe in there
 
02:31:42.880 --> 02:31:47.309 align:start position:0%
um I I do like the word severe in there
somewhere

02:31:47.309 --> 02:31:47.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:51.230 --> 02:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
um um but I I I do th I think it's
 
02:31:53.950 --> 02:31:53.960 align:start position:0%
important for for people to understand
 
02:31:58.190 --> 02:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
that that authorities were
 
02:31:58.200 --> 02:32:02.910 align:start position:0%
that that authorities were
exceeded

02:32:02.910 --> 02:32:02.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:05.670 --> 02:32:05.680 align:start position:0%
okay represent Belcher thank you madam
 
02:32:07.150 --> 02:32:07.160 align:start position:0%
chair based on the input I have changed
 
02:32:09.590 --> 02:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
the words significantly to severely such
 
02:32:11.590 --> 02:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
that it now reads these measures were
 
02:32:13.510 --> 02:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
documented as being severely disruptive
 
02:32:15.110 --> 02:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
to the lives of New Hampshire residents
 
02:32:17.070 --> 02:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
and are highlighted by this committee as
 
02:32:19.070 --> 02:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
apparently extrac constitutional in
 
02:32:19.080 --> 02:32:22.190 align:start position:0%
apparently extrac constitutional in
nature

02:32:22.190 --> 02:32:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:53.469 --> 02:32:53.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:56.670 --> 02:32:56.680 align:start position:0%
any other changes to 29 if not let's
 
02:33:24.429 --> 02:33:24.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:24.439 --> 02:33:26.750 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:33:26.750 --> 02:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:33:29.469 --> 02:33:29.479 align:start position:0%
Penza yeah at the bottom of page 29 I
 
02:33:32.950 --> 02:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
would just love to add a line so it
 
02:33:34.670 --> 02:33:34.680 align:start position:0%
here's the paragraph it is therefore the
 
02:33:36.750 --> 02:33:36.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation of this committee that
 
02:33:38.710 --> 02:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
such excesses of authority the claiming
 
02:33:40.150 --> 02:33:40.160 align:start position:0%
of police powers to divide the
 
02:33:42.670 --> 02:33:42.680 align:start position:0%
population order healthy persons Liberty
 
02:33:44.750 --> 02:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
severely restricted order houses of
 
02:33:48.110 --> 02:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
worship and private business business
 
02:33:50.670 --> 02:33:50.680 align:start position:0%
shuttered and the light should never
 
02:33:53.389 --> 02:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
again be pursued by this government you
 
02:33:56.790 --> 02:33:56.800 align:start position:0%
I would rather say yeah we
 
02:33:59.150 --> 02:33:59.160 align:start position:0%
we I would like another sentence that
 
02:34:03.190 --> 02:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
basically says you know something like
 
02:34:06.030 --> 02:34:06.040 align:start position:0%
um the multitudes of civil liberties
 
02:34:07.510 --> 02:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
that were
 
02:34:10.349 --> 02:34:10.359 align:start position:0%
violated uh throughout the uh you know
 
02:34:13.870 --> 02:34:13.880 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire's um response to the
 
02:34:13.880 --> 02:34:15.630 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire's um response to the
covid-19

02:34:15.630 --> 02:34:15.640 align:start position:0%
covid-19
 
02:34:15.640 --> 02:34:18.070 align:start position:0%
covid-19
um

02:34:18.070 --> 02:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:20.429 --> 02:34:20.439 align:start position:0%
pandemic the legisl needs to make sure
 
02:34:24.030 --> 02:34:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:26.990 --> 02:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
again uh representative beler but also I
 
02:34:29.110 --> 02:34:29.120 align:start position:0%
think in private business it needs to be
 
02:34:31.630 --> 02:34:31.640 align:start position:0%
plural businesses that's
 
02:34:35.910 --> 02:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
right so please changed and
 
02:34:39.590 --> 02:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
fixed and just to uh Echo the sentiment
 
02:34:41.429 --> 02:34:41.439 align:start position:0%
I I I think the sentiment is accurate
 
02:34:43.830 --> 02:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
but I think the paragraph before the
 
02:34:46.910 --> 02:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
last paragraph actually does great
 
02:34:50.710 --> 02:34:50.720 align:start position:0%
Justice to that sentiment
 
02:34:52.910 --> 02:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
I agree with representative
 
02:34:57.030 --> 02:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
beler I I don't think we need to um put
 
02:34:59.590 --> 02:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:59.600 --> 02:35:08.190 align:start position:0%
 
again

02:35:08.190 --> 02:35:08.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:11.910 --> 02:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
exactly any other changes to page

page
30

02:35:48.630 --> 02:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:45.469 --> 02:36:45.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:48.510 --> 02:36:48.520 align:start position:0%
any changes to page
 
02:37:42.030 --> 02:37:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:44.230 --> 02:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
representa Penza just I just want to
 
02:37:46.790 --> 02:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
make sure that um if if everybody page
 
02:37:48.590 --> 02:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
it's on we're on 30 we're at the top
 
02:37:50.670 --> 02:37:50.680 align:start position:0%
paragraph starting off at the
 
02:37:52.309 --> 02:37:52.319 align:start position:0%
government's recommended vaccines
 
02:37:54.710 --> 02:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
mandated vaccines rolled out vaccines I
 
02:37:56.590 --> 02:37:56.600 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that we are
 
02:37:59.750 --> 02:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
saying that it's you know this is the
 
02:38:02.230 --> 02:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
federal and New Hampshire because it was
 
02:38:05.150 --> 02:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
it was crystal clear that um you know
 
02:38:07.670 --> 02:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
both of those were happening
 
02:38:10.070 --> 02:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
simultaneously and I think that this one
 
02:38:12.190 --> 02:38:12.200 align:start position:0%
piece you know we did a whole laundry
 
02:38:13.630 --> 02:38:13.640 align:start position:0%
list of
 
02:38:20.230 --> 02:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:25.309 --> 02:38:25.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:29.910 --> 02:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
censorship we we advertised we did
 
02:38:32.309 --> 02:38:32.319 align:start position:0%
Billboards in New Hampshire that said
 
02:38:35.110 --> 02:38:35.120 align:start position:0%
this is your chance you know to get you
 
02:38:37.269 --> 02:38:37.279 align:start position:0%
know this is your shot to get back on
 
02:38:39.269 --> 02:38:39.279 align:start position:0%
you know we
 
02:38:42.429 --> 02:38:42.439 align:start position:0%
basically that's not necessarily
 
02:38:44.230 --> 02:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
propaganda it was like okay you want to
 
02:38:46.670 --> 02:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
get back to normal you know go get go
 
02:38:50.030 --> 02:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
get the shot and um this is your shot to
 
02:38:51.990 --> 02:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
get back to normal and we did
 
02:38:54.469 --> 02:38:54.479 align:start position:0%
commercials where it
 
02:38:58.870 --> 02:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
had the governor uh dror Chan Lori
 
02:39:01.630 --> 02:39:01.640 align:start position:0%
shonet you know walking in the woods um
 
02:39:03.750 --> 02:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
telling everybody to get themselves and
 
02:39:06.870 --> 02:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
their children injected I really believe
 
02:39:08.990 --> 02:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
that that I want to I want to make that
 
02:39:10.950 --> 02:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
clear I don't I don't know if that's
 
02:39:13.309 --> 02:39:13.319 align:start position:0%
considered propaganda we we literally
 
02:39:16.750 --> 02:39:16.760 align:start position:0%
advertised for this so I I want that in
 
02:39:19.110 --> 02:39:19.120 align:start position:0%
there representative beler thank you
 
02:39:20.630 --> 02:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
madam chair and just to address the
 
02:39:24.469 --> 02:39:24.479 align:start position:0%
members um point I think if you take the
 
02:39:26.269 --> 02:39:26.279 align:start position:0%
totality of both this section and a
 
02:39:29.150 --> 02:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
future section that we're coming to into
 
02:39:32.510 --> 02:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
the full view I I suspect you will be
 
02:39:33.950 --> 02:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
satisfied with the way those items were
 
02:39:33.960 --> 02:39:36.750 align:start position:0%
satisfied with the way those items were
handled

02:39:36.750 --> 02:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
handled
 
02:39:40.309 --> 02:39:40.319 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that um any other
 
02:39:47.750 --> 02:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:54.030 --> 02:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:56.230 --> 02:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
31 representative
 
02:40:00.269 --> 02:40:00.279 align:start position:0%
Weary at the top of 31 where it starts
 
02:40:02.710 --> 02:40:02.720 align:start position:0%
out from the gathered testimony of New
 
02:40:05.630 --> 02:40:05.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire officials and goes on to talk
 
02:40:08.750 --> 02:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
about the CDC in the next sentence it it
 
02:40:12.230 --> 02:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
says it also does not appear they is
 
02:40:15.269 --> 02:40:15.279 align:start position:0%
does they mean both New Hampshire
 
02:40:17.150 --> 02:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
officials and
 
02:40:21.910 --> 02:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:27.110 --> 02:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
one does it does not it also does not
 
02:40:30.010 --> 02:40:30.020 align:start position:0%
appear New Hampshire officials or the
 
02:40:30.020 --> 02:40:34.269 align:start position:0%
appear New Hampshire officials or the
[Music]

02:40:34.269 --> 02:40:34.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:36.830 --> 02:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
CDC um there could be anybody it could
 
02:40:38.590 --> 02:40:38.600 align:start position:0%
even be the public right it does not
 
02:40:42.950 --> 02:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
appear they were aware of an established
 
02:40:46.870 --> 02:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
F Narrative of safe and effective I mean
 
02:40:48.469 --> 02:40:48.479 align:start position:0%
and I think this is one of the questions
 
02:40:52.150 --> 02:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
we addressed ear on in our intro is we
 
02:40:56.030 --> 02:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
don't know when they were made aware or
 
02:41:01.790 --> 02:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
when though you know we can't begin to
 
02:41:06.510 --> 02:41:06.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:09.030 --> 02:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
poent so after the first sentence you're
 
02:41:11.030 --> 02:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
talking about that second line that says
 
02:41:14.190 --> 02:41:14.200 align:start position:0%
it also does not appear they were aware
 
02:41:16.630 --> 02:41:16.640 align:start position:0%
of an established preferred narrative by
 
02:41:21.070 --> 02:41:21.080 align:start position:0%
federal authorities of safe and effect
 
02:41:25.070 --> 02:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
that may even injected bias into Federal
 
02:41:29.389 --> 02:41:29.399 align:start position:0%
guidance this I mean in New Hampshire
 
02:41:32.150 --> 02:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
that quote unquote safe and effective
 
02:41:35.710 --> 02:41:35.720 align:start position:0%
was literally said probably you know a
 
02:41:38.950 --> 02:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
million times so I
 
02:41:42.349 --> 02:41:42.359 align:start position:0%
don't I don't agree with that it they
 
02:41:44.870 --> 02:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
were aware because they said it over and
 
02:41:47.790 --> 02:41:47.800 align:start position:0%
over and over again okay uh
 
02:41:49.950 --> 02:41:49.960 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher thank you madam
 
02:41:52.190 --> 02:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
chair and just to clarify yes indeed
 
02:41:54.349 --> 02:41:54.359 align:start position:0%
they did but the the purpose of the
 
02:41:57.190 --> 02:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
sentence here is not to say that they
 
02:41:59.309 --> 02:41:59.319 align:start position:0%
didn't adopt The Narrative of safe and
 
02:42:01.630 --> 02:42:01.640 align:start position:0%
effective it's simply to state that they
 
02:42:04.269 --> 02:42:04.279 align:start position:0%
did not necessarily according to what we
 
02:42:07.230 --> 02:42:07.240 align:start position:0%
have gathered have access to the federal
 
02:42:09.910 --> 02:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
data and the private emails that we now
 
02:42:13.190 --> 02:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
have from the federal government that
 
02:42:15.870 --> 02:42:15.880 align:start position:0%
highlight that this was not
 
02:42:20.110 --> 02:42:20.120 align:start position:0%
actually the conclusion of research data
 
02:42:22.750 --> 02:42:22.760 align:start position:0%
but rather a preferred narrative that
 
02:42:25.230 --> 02:42:25.240 align:start position:0%
was being promulgated at the federal
 
02:42:27.870 --> 02:42:27.880 align:start position:0%
level um that was rather uncritically
 
02:42:29.469 --> 02:42:29.479 align:start position:0%
adopted at the state
 
02:42:32.070 --> 02:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
level my question then at the end of
 
02:42:35.630 --> 02:42:35.640 align:start position:0%
that sentence is that may have injected
 
02:42:38.230 --> 02:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
bias into State guidance would it be it
 
02:42:39.550 --> 02:42:39.560 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be Federal guidance it should
 
02:42:46.309 --> 02:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:50.309 --> 02:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
agree uh represent we could we uh along
 
02:42:52.429 --> 02:42:52.439 align:start position:0%
the lines of what representative beler
 
02:42:56.590 --> 02:42:56.600 align:start position:0%
just said perhaps we just say um New
 
02:43:00.269 --> 02:43:00.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire officials adopted the
 
02:43:02.670 --> 02:43:02.680 align:start position:0%
preferred uh narrative by federal of
 
02:43:02.680 --> 02:43:03.710 align:start position:0%
preferred uh narrative by federal of
safe

02:43:03.710 --> 02:43:03.720 align:start position:0%
safe
 
02:43:08.670 --> 02:43:08.680 align:start position:0%
effective a and carried over that bias
 
02:43:15.070 --> 02:43:15.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:17.150 --> 02:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
guidance because it's it's their
 
02:43:20.830 --> 02:43:20.840 align:start position:0%
adoption of the narrative that that that
 
02:43:23.630 --> 02:43:23.640 align:start position:0%
biased them
 
02:43:27.349 --> 02:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
toward what they promulgated as state
 
02:43:27.359 --> 02:43:29.070 align:start position:0%
toward what they promulgated as state
guidance

02:43:29.070 --> 02:43:29.080 align:start position:0%
guidance
 
02:43:32.710 --> 02:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
oh uh represent Bel uh suggest to take a
 
02:43:34.870 --> 02:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
shot at this to modify it uh beginning
 
02:43:37.429 --> 02:43:37.439 align:start position:0%
with it also does not appear that they
 
02:43:39.110 --> 02:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
were aware of an established preferred
 
02:43:41.070 --> 02:43:41.080 align:start position:0%
narrative by federal authorities of safe
 
02:43:43.269 --> 02:43:43.279 align:start position:0%
and effective that may have injected
 
02:43:46.550 --> 02:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
bias into guidance both state and
 
02:43:51.990 --> 02:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:53.750 --> 02:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
any other
 
02:43:56.389 --> 02:43:56.399 align:start position:0%
comments represent po
 
02:44:00.349 --> 02:44:00.359 align:start position:0%
off the same sentence in uh in a view
 
02:44:02.590 --> 02:44:02.600 align:start position:0%
what we just
 
02:44:05.150 --> 02:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
discussed I don't think it's
 
02:44:09.710 --> 02:44:09.720 align:start position:0%
like aware is the right word here it
 
02:44:13.349 --> 02:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
also does not appear a aware of an
 
02:44:15.469 --> 02:44:15.479 align:start position:0%
established preferred
 
02:44:18.469 --> 02:44:18.479 align:start position:0%
narrative by federal authorities of safe
 
02:44:21.990 --> 02:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
and effective what we are trying to say
 
02:44:26.070 --> 02:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
that they were not aware of full
 
02:44:30.429 --> 02:44:30.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:33.389 --> 02:44:33.399 align:start position:0%
authorities established this narrative
 
02:44:33.399 --> 02:44:36.030 align:start position:0%
authorities established this narrative
or

02:44:36.030 --> 02:44:36.040 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:44:41.429 --> 02:44:41.439 align:start position:0%
like so the narrative was clear but some
 
02:44:45.830 --> 02:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
data behind it was hidden from our state
 
02:44:48.710 --> 02:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
authorities uh so so that's what we need
 
02:44:48.720 --> 02:44:51.910 align:start position:0%
authorities uh so so that's what we need
to

02:44:51.910 --> 02:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:54.309 --> 02:44:54.319 align:start position:0%
say I I believe that is covered as we
 
02:44:56.429 --> 02:44:56.439 align:start position:0%
continue through this um section yeah go
 
02:45:17.950 --> 02:45:17.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:04.030 --> 02:46:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:05.870 --> 02:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
represent pull is
 
02:46:08.910 --> 02:46:08.920 align:start position:0%
off I I like the the next paragraph I
 
02:46:12.550 --> 02:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
still find the first paragraph confusing
 
02:46:15.910 --> 02:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
but if majority feels it's okay uh I'm
 
02:46:17.150 --> 02:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
fine with
 
02:46:20.750 --> 02:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
it okay any other Chang is on
 
02:47:01.670 --> 02:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:01.680 --> 02:47:03.110 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:47:03.110 --> 02:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:47:05.910 --> 02:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
Penza okay so this is my plug to get a
 
02:47:07.950 --> 02:47:07.960 align:start position:0%
sentence in here so
 
02:47:10.710 --> 02:47:10.720 align:start position:0%
underneath lastly propaganda is defined
 
02:47:13.030 --> 02:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
by blah blah blah I think what paragraph
 
02:47:14.710 --> 02:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
uh it's the second it's the second
 
02:47:16.790 --> 02:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
paragraph cuz thank you there's a Top
 
02:47:18.469 --> 02:47:18.479 align:start position:0%
Line and then it's really the second
 
02:47:18.479 --> 02:47:19.590 align:start position:0%
Line and then it's really the second
paragraph

02:47:19.590 --> 02:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
02:47:25.670 --> 02:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:28.750 --> 02:47:28.760 align:start position:0%
32 I like that we defined what it is I
 
02:47:30.429 --> 02:47:30.439 align:start position:0%
think we should
 
02:47:33.670 --> 02:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
state or I think we should list or note
 
02:47:35.830 --> 02:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
what the state did and how they engaged
 
02:47:38.389 --> 02:47:38.399 align:start position:0%
in it
 
02:47:41.590 --> 02:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
spending hundreds of thousands of
 
02:47:45.230 --> 02:47:45.240 align:start position:0%
dollars on
 
02:47:50.070 --> 02:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
commercials um car wraps
 
02:47:52.469 --> 02:47:52.479 align:start position:0%
stuff I mean everything that you could
 
02:47:54.309 --> 02:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
uh press
 
02:47:57.389 --> 02:47:57.399 align:start position:0%
releases um press
 
02:47:57.399 --> 02:47:58.910 align:start position:0%
releases um press
conferences

02:47:58.910 --> 02:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
conferences
 
02:48:01.870 --> 02:48:01.880 align:start position:0%
Billboards to continue this whole
 
02:48:06.670 --> 02:48:06.680 align:start position:0%
propaganda like based upon driving fear
 
02:48:09.230 --> 02:48:09.240 align:start position:0%
as well as
 
02:48:13.830 --> 02:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
um to go you know to to to go get um the
 
02:48:15.590 --> 02:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
shot to get back to normal this is your
 
02:48:18.590 --> 02:48:18.600 align:start position:0%
shot to get back to normal um and I just
 
02:48:23.750 --> 02:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
I I think all of that is is utterly
 
02:48:26.750 --> 02:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
disgusting um I think when you get down
 
02:48:31.590 --> 02:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
further into um it um I think that
 
02:48:33.750 --> 02:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
representative belum representative
 
02:48:38.269 --> 02:48:38.279 align:start position:0%
weary did a good job um really bringing
 
02:48:40.110 --> 02:48:40.120 align:start position:0%
out the
 
02:48:43.550 --> 02:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
Grievances uh without expressing some of
 
02:48:46.269 --> 02:48:46.279 align:start position:0%
that and talking about represent Bela
 
02:48:48.269 --> 02:48:48.279 align:start position:0%
represent where thank you madam chair in
 
02:48:50.790 --> 02:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
just a second satisfy that um sentiment
 
02:48:52.630 --> 02:48:52.640 align:start position:0%
I think there can be a simple addition
 
02:48:56.110 --> 02:48:56.120 align:start position:0%
of the following short paragraph between
 
02:48:58.910 --> 02:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
uh after that that last one that simply
 
02:49:00.190 --> 02:49:00.200 align:start position:0%
States the state of New Hampshire
 
02:49:01.750 --> 02:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
adopted and forwarded narratives during
 
02:49:03.510 --> 02:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
the pandemic around such items as
 
02:49:06.150 --> 02:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
stay-at-home vaccination of VAR various
 
02:49:08.150 --> 02:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
demographics including children the
 
02:49:09.710 --> 02:49:09.720 align:start position:0%
safety and efficacy of vaccines and
 
02:49:12.269 --> 02:49:12.279 align:start position:0%
treatments and
 
02:49:15.070 --> 02:49:15.080 align:start position:0%
more okay represent
 
02:49:18.349 --> 02:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
weary uh at the risk of being overly
 
02:49:18.359 --> 02:49:19.550 align:start position:0%
weary uh at the risk of being overly
simp

02:49:19.550 --> 02:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
simp
 
02:49:23.349 --> 02:49:23.359 align:start position:0%
um could may maybe we could just say um
 
02:49:26.550 --> 02:49:26.560 align:start position:0%
we're engaged in propaganda and
 
02:49:26.560 --> 02:49:28.030 align:start position:0%
we're engaged in propaganda and
extensive

02:49:28.030 --> 02:49:28.040 align:start position:0%
extensive
 
02:49:28.040 --> 02:49:32.190 align:start position:0%
extensive
marketing

02:49:32.190 --> 02:49:32.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:35.389 --> 02:49:35.399 align:start position:0%
that use the public
 
02:49:35.399 --> 02:49:39.870 align:start position:0%
that use the public
sphere

02:49:39.870 --> 02:49:39.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:39.880 --> 02:49:43.510 align:start position:0%
 
of

02:49:43.510 --> 02:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:53.309 --> 02:49:53.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:56.990 --> 02:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
um take the vaccine Etc I I something
 
02:50:00.030 --> 02:50:00.040 align:start position:0%
along those lines because I think
 
02:50:03.950 --> 02:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
that's much of the extensive marketing
 
02:50:07.070 --> 02:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
that representative Potenza discussed
 
02:50:09.550 --> 02:50:09.560 align:start position:0%
was around the VAC obtaining the vaccine
 
02:50:15.190 --> 02:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
Andor boosters and I think that that I I
 
02:50:15.200 --> 02:50:16.150 align:start position:0%
Andor boosters and I think that that I I
think

02:50:16.150 --> 02:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:50:20.590 --> 02:50:20.600 align:start position:0%
that's perhaps the the the we should
 
02:50:22.469 --> 02:50:22.479 align:start position:0%
identify that as kind of the point of
 
02:50:27.150 --> 02:50:27.160 align:start position:0%
Singularity to kind of you know that
 
02:50:30.229 --> 02:50:30.239 align:start position:0%
was very concerning in especially in
 
02:50:32.429 --> 02:50:32.439 align:start position:0%
light of the lack of data as as
 
02:50:34.830 --> 02:50:34.840 align:start position:0%
discussed in earlier paragraphs I think
 
02:50:37.870 --> 02:50:37.880 align:start position:0%
if um maybe you have an alternative
 
02:50:40.990 --> 02:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
there I um I have um something that I'd
 
02:50:43.830 --> 02:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
like to add to this um and it kind of
 
02:50:47.150 --> 02:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
brings all of it together but as was
 
02:50:49.670 --> 02:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
discussed here in a bipartisan
 
02:50:54.910 --> 02:50:54.920 align:start position:0%
manner that power politics and
 
02:50:58.550 --> 02:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
money really ruled the
 
02:51:02.349 --> 02:51:02.359 align:start position:0%
propaganda of the pandemic and I
 
02:51:04.750 --> 02:51:04.760 align:start position:0%
think by instilling
 
02:51:09.710 --> 02:51:09.720 align:start position:0%
fear they were able to do that so maybe
 
02:51:12.990 --> 02:51:13.000 align:start position:0%
instead of listing everything out we
 
02:51:15.150 --> 02:51:15.160 align:start position:0%
talk about the fear that was instilled
 
02:51:18.030 --> 02:51:18.040 align:start position:0%
and understand that it was about power
 
02:51:19.590 --> 02:51:19.600 align:start position:0%
politics and
 
02:51:23.590 --> 02:51:23.600 align:start position:0%
money and that's why everything was
 
02:51:26.309 --> 02:51:26.319 align:start position:0%
propagandized I mean that's just a
 
02:51:28.510 --> 02:51:28.520 align:start position:0%
thought but I'll let the word Smiths
 
02:51:44.710 --> 02:51:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:47.630 --> 02:51:47.640 align:start position:0%
that if I may take another shot at
 
02:51:48.990 --> 02:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
trying to put this all together I'm
 
02:51:51.030 --> 02:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
going to read the whole paragraph to to
 
02:51:54.429 --> 02:51:54.439 align:start position:0%
put it in context okay lastly propaganda
 
02:51:56.349 --> 02:51:56.359 align:start position:0%
is defined by the mam Webster dictionary
 
02:51:59.150 --> 02:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
as ideas facts or allegations spread
 
02:52:01.309 --> 02:52:01.319 align:start position:0%
deliberately to further one's cause or
 
02:52:04.670 --> 02:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
to damage an opposing cause as such
 
02:52:06.510 --> 02:52:06.520 align:start position:0%
anytime an official position or
 
02:52:08.790 --> 02:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
narrative is adopted by the state an
 
02:52:11.150 --> 02:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
official speech or media is undertaken
 
02:52:13.150 --> 02:52:13.160 align:start position:0%
to advance that position or narrative
 
02:52:16.269 --> 02:52:16.279 align:start position:0%
publicly the state is definitionally
 
02:52:18.870 --> 02:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
engaged in propaganda this is the case
 
02:52:20.630 --> 02:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
regardless of the truth or falsity of
 
02:52:22.309 --> 02:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
the position narrative or propaganda
 
02:52:24.469 --> 02:52:24.479 align:start position:0%
being engaged in the state of New
 
02:52:25.830 --> 02:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire adopted and forwarded
 
02:52:27.469 --> 02:52:27.479 align:start position:0%
narratives and engaged in fear-based
 
02:52:29.389 --> 02:52:29.399 align:start position:0%
marketing during the pandemic around
 
02:52:32.229 --> 02:52:32.239 align:start position:0%
such items as stay-at-home vaccination
 
02:52:33.830 --> 02:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
of various demographics including
 
02:52:37.030 --> 02:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
children I.E our shot to get back to
 
02:52:39.309 --> 02:52:39.319 align:start position:0%
normal the safety and efficacy of
 
02:52:42.070 --> 02:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
vaccines and treatments and more these
 
02:52:43.750 --> 02:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
items were directly related to Federal
 
02:52:48.870 --> 02:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:48.880 --> 02:52:50.070 align:start position:0%

Perfection okay anything else on page 32
 
02:53:01.830 --> 02:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
because then we are basically done I do
 
02:53:04.030 --> 02:53:04.040 align:start position:0%
believe you're going to add oh no we're
 
02:53:04.040 --> 02:53:05.349 align:start position:0%
believe you're going to add oh no we're
almost

02:53:05.349 --> 02:53:05.359 align:start position:0%
almost
 
02:53:07.790 --> 02:53:07.800 align:start position:0%
done okay
 
02:53:21.309 --> 02:53:21.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:54.550 --> 02:53:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:54.560 --> 02:53:56.550 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:53:56.550 --> 02:53:56.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:53:58.630 --> 02:53:58.640 align:start position:0%
Penza I'm just going to make a comment
 
02:54:00.190 --> 02:54:00.200 align:start position:0%
because I know we can't change this I
 
02:54:03.070 --> 02:54:03.080 align:start position:0%
just I wish we would have had well and
 
02:54:05.910 --> 02:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
maybe we will have more time but um
 
02:54:09.990 --> 02:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
specifically on monoclonal antibodies
 
02:54:15.269 --> 02:54:15.279 align:start position:0%
um I can't tell you how how how much um
 
02:54:17.389 --> 02:54:17.399 align:start position:0%
how many people I talk to concerning
 
02:54:20.590 --> 02:54:20.600 align:start position:0%
this how many people were um were sick
 
02:54:22.990 --> 02:54:23.000 align:start position:0%
and that and that needed to get those
 
02:54:25.750 --> 02:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
and um if you just want to compare New
 
02:54:27.269 --> 02:54:27.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to
 
02:54:30.150 --> 02:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
Florida Florida made these reibly
 
02:54:33.870 --> 02:54:33.880 align:start position:0%
accessible to everyone there was not um
 
02:54:37.630 --> 02:54:37.640 align:start position:0%
there was no problem in supply for those
 
02:54:40.110 --> 02:54:40.120 align:start position:0%
and it and it worked for a lot of people
 
02:54:41.670 --> 02:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
that helped them when they were
 
02:54:46.190 --> 02:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
suffering from covid and our state was
 
02:54:49.550 --> 02:54:49.560 align:start position:0%
dismal in that um misinformation that
 
02:54:52.389 --> 02:54:52.399 align:start position:0%
was put on the website where there
 
02:54:54.830 --> 02:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
someone could get the monocon anybody's
 
02:54:56.830 --> 02:54:56.840 align:start position:0%
they tried to try to get them and then
 
02:54:58.070 --> 02:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
they said that they couldn't because it
 
02:55:00.630 --> 02:55:00.640 align:start position:0%
was only for certain specific people so
 
02:55:03.429 --> 02:55:03.439 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to make a note that is um
 
02:55:06.269 --> 02:55:06.279 align:start position:0%
that is something that really helped a
 
02:55:09.349 --> 02:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
lot of people get better and we um we
 
02:55:11.950 --> 02:55:11.960 align:start position:0%
failed in that um we failed in that
 
02:55:15.269 --> 02:55:15.279 align:start position:0%
regard um which is really sad for me
 
02:55:17.150 --> 02:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
representative belg thank you madam
 
02:55:19.550 --> 02:55:19.560 align:start position:0%
chair and uh just to highlight that we
 
02:55:21.670 --> 02:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
did cover this at least briefly in in a
 
02:55:24.670 --> 02:55:24.680 align:start position:0%
previous uh Committee hearing but I I
 
02:55:27.349 --> 02:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
was one of those people who was very ill
 
02:55:30.630 --> 02:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
with covid received an order for
 
02:55:33.710 --> 02:55:33.720 align:start position:0%
covid-19 monoclonal antibodies but was
 
02:55:35.670 --> 02:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
nonetheless refused the treatment
 
02:55:45.389 --> 02:55:45.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:49.150 --> 02:55:49.160 align:start position:0%
policy so
 
02:55:50.830 --> 02:55:50.840 align:start position:0%
I guess my
 
02:55:55.630 --> 02:55:55.640 align:start position:0%
question in medical terms and I'm not a
 
02:55:57.910 --> 02:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
doctor but I always thought the first
 
02:55:59.550 --> 02:55:59.560 align:start position:0%
thing is Do no
 
02:56:02.510 --> 02:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
harm um
 
02:56:06.070 --> 02:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
so if someone knows there is a treatment
 
02:56:09.110 --> 02:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
and you need to get that treatment but
 
02:56:12.150 --> 02:56:12.160 align:start position:0%
we're picking and choosing who can get
 
02:56:16.269 --> 02:56:16.279 align:start position:0%
it instead of the person that's there
 
02:56:18.790 --> 02:56:18.800 align:start position:0%
immediately in there for treating me and
 
02:56:19.990 --> 02:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
holding it
 
02:56:23.510 --> 02:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
back what does that say about our system
 
02:56:26.429 --> 02:56:26.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:30.269 --> 02:56:30.279 align:start position:0%
question uh representative
 
02:56:33.389 --> 02:56:33.399 align:start position:0%
Weary at at the risk of uh going
 
02:56:36.269 --> 02:56:36.279 align:start position:0%
backwards in our review here I I
 
02:56:36.279 --> 02:56:38.910 align:start position:0%
backwards in our review here I I
would

02:56:38.910 --> 02:56:38.920 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:56:42.070 --> 02:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to go back to page 31 from
 
02:56:44.790 --> 02:56:44.800 align:start position:0%
the uh where it says from the gathered
 
02:56:48.389 --> 02:56:48.399 align:start position:0%
testimony of New Hampshire officials
 
02:56:51.190 --> 02:56:51.200 align:start position:0%
I I thought about that second sentence
 
02:56:55.269 --> 02:56:55.279 align:start position:0%
where it says it does not appear and I
 
02:56:58.150 --> 02:56:58.160 align:start position:0%
would I do have two sentences which I
 
02:57:01.710 --> 02:57:01.720 align:start position:0%
wrote out which I think might be be
 
02:57:05.309 --> 02:57:05.319 align:start position:0%
useful instead of that sentence the two
 
02:57:05.319 --> 02:57:06.790 align:start position:0%
useful instead of that sentence the two
sentences

02:57:06.790 --> 02:57:06.800 align:start position:0%
sentences
 
02:57:09.469 --> 02:57:09.479 align:start position:0%
are federal authorities created a
 
02:57:11.710 --> 02:57:11.720 align:start position:0%
narrative of safe and effective that was
 
02:57:13.830 --> 02:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
unsupported by data and
 
02:57:17.590 --> 02:57:17.600 align:start position:0%
evidence period State authorities
 
02:57:20.150 --> 02:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
unaware of the lack of supportive data
 
02:57:23.670 --> 02:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
adopted the narrative and implemented it
 
02:57:25.670 --> 02:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
as policy in state
 
02:57:29.469 --> 02:57:29.479 align:start position:0%
guidance so my question to you is is
 
02:57:32.870 --> 02:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
lack of knowledge I wouldn't say lack of
 
02:57:36.870 --> 02:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
knowledge I would say um something
 
02:57:40.110 --> 02:57:40.120 align:start position:0%
of maybe lack of awareness at the time
 
02:57:43.790 --> 02:57:43.800 align:start position:0%
or something to that because once
 
02:57:46.910 --> 02:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
everybody knew then everybody knew right
 
02:57:53.870 --> 02:57:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:55.950 --> 02:57:55.960 align:start position:0%
question uh we could say State
 
02:57:58.670 --> 02:57:58.680 align:start position:0%
authorities at the time on you know
 
02:58:00.150 --> 02:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
maybe that that would be a good
 
02:58:17.110 --> 02:58:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:17.120 --> 02:58:47.030 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:58:47.030 --> 02:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:47.040 --> 02:59:17.030 align:start position:0%
 
e

02:59:17.030 --> 02:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:14.990 --> 03:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:17.670 --> 03:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
if I may I'll just reread this paragraph
 
03:00:20.950 --> 03:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
down there's been an edit um from the
 
03:00:22.229 --> 03:00:22.239 align:start position:0%
gathered testimony of New Hampshire
 
03:00:23.670 --> 03:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
officials it does not appear that these
 
03:00:25.190 --> 03:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
authorities within our state were aware
 
03:00:26.870 --> 03:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
of these safety issues at the time that
 
03:00:29.349 --> 03:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
the CDC had this data Federal
 
03:00:30.790 --> 03:00:30.800 align:start position:0%
authorities developed a narrative of
 
03:00:32.510 --> 03:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
safe and effective that was knowingly
 
03:00:35.110 --> 03:00:35.120 align:start position:0%
not supported by data at the time the
 
03:00:36.349 --> 03:00:36.359 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire authorities
 
03:00:38.269 --> 03:00:38.279 align:start position:0%
adopted this narrative uncritically and
 
03:00:40.030 --> 03:00:40.040 align:start position:0%
implemented it as policy and state
 
03:00:41.950 --> 03:00:41.960 align:start position:0%
guidance it appears that the official
 
03:00:43.349 --> 03:00:43.359 align:start position:0%
narrative conclusions of federal
 
03:00:45.190 --> 03:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
authorities and select public private
 
03:00:46.830 --> 03:00:46.840 align:start position:0%
Partnerships such as some of those
 
03:00:49.150 --> 03:00:49.160 align:start position:0%
overseeing vaccine SA and efficacy were
 
03:00:50.630 --> 03:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
readily adopted by relevant New
 
03:00:51.950 --> 03:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire authorities without any
 
03:00:53.910 --> 03:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
circumspect and critical
 
03:00:56.269 --> 03:00:56.279 align:start position:0%
review indeed the state epidemiologist
 
03:00:57.750 --> 03:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
testified that at no point did the state
 
03:00:59.229 --> 03:00:59.239 align:start position:0%
generate any of her own guidance around
 
03:01:00.870 --> 03:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
vaccines but rather merely adopted
 
03:01:00.880 --> 03:01:02.309 align:start position:0%
vaccines but rather merely adopted
Federal

03:01:02.309 --> 03:01:02.319 align:start position:0%
Federal
 
03:01:04.830 --> 03:01:04.840 align:start position:0%
guidance any
 
03:01:08.870 --> 03:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
discussion represent po off yeah I'm
 
03:01:11.790 --> 03:01:11.800 align:start position:0%
thankful for this change so in terms of
 
03:01:15.870 --> 03:01:15.880 align:start position:0%
uh Mal clonal antibodies I wonder if we
 
03:01:21.030 --> 03:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
can include it into two to e or to F
 
03:01:23.269 --> 03:01:23.279 align:start position:0%
where we talk about executive
 
03:01:25.790 --> 03:01:25.800 align:start position:0%
legislative and judicial functions on
 
03:01:28.389 --> 03:01:28.399 align:start position:0%
level of government integration or
 
03:01:32.429 --> 03:01:32.439 align:start position:0%
cooperation communication and I would
 
03:01:36.469 --> 03:01:36.479 align:start position:0%
uh increase it to some other treatments
 
03:01:36.479 --> 03:01:37.710 align:start position:0%
uh increase it to some other treatments
that

03:01:37.710 --> 03:01:37.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:01:42.429 --> 03:01:42.439 align:start position:0%
were um suppressed by policies of
 
03:01:45.030 --> 03:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
government so it's not just monoclonal
 
03:01:49.269 --> 03:01:49.279 align:start position:0%
antibodies it's atin it's G
 
03:01:53.990 --> 03:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
chloro it's uh uh it's some
 
03:01:58.550 --> 03:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
um uh treatment protocols that would uh
 
03:02:03.910 --> 03:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
use uh uh some antivirals earlier than
 
03:02:06.950 --> 03:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
it was in practice so there were some
 
03:02:09.030 --> 03:02:09.040 align:start position:0%
treatments that were suppressed so I
 
03:02:12.349 --> 03:02:12.359 align:start position:0%
wonder if we can uh include it uh in
 
03:02:16.389 --> 03:02:16.399 align:start position:0%
some of policy uh discussions uh under
 
03:02:19.790 --> 03:02:19.800 align:start position:0%
number two as a certain paragraph that
 
03:02:28.590 --> 03:02:28.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:31.590 --> 03:02:31.600 align:start position:0%
practice uh I think that under Equity
 
03:02:34.429 --> 03:02:34.439 align:start position:0%
measures that may already exist because
 
03:02:36.190 --> 03:02:36.200 align:start position:0%
we were talking about how things were
 
03:02:39.469 --> 03:02:39.479 align:start position:0%
applied equitably and how certain people
 
03:02:41.630 --> 03:02:41.640 align:start position:0%
didn't receive certain things represent
 
03:02:44.349 --> 03:02:44.359 align:start position:0%
Bel thank you madam chair I I think that
 
03:02:45.990 --> 03:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
is a whole totally different issue from
 
03:02:48.070 --> 03:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
the equity policies cuz the it was was a
 
03:02:50.349 --> 03:02:50.359 align:start position:0%
different thing um it would have to go
 
03:02:51.710 --> 03:02:51.720 align:start position:0%
somewhere else and while I don't
 
03:02:53.190 --> 03:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily disagree with the utility of
 
03:02:55.190 --> 03:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
it I think at this point it's too late
 
03:02:56.590 --> 03:02:56.600 align:start position:0%
to go back and add what would
 
03:02:58.630 --> 03:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
effectively be a whole another section
 
03:03:01.389 --> 03:03:01.399 align:start position:0%
on suppressed treatments um when we
 
03:03:02.710 --> 03:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
really probably should have voted on
 
03:03:04.469 --> 03:03:04.479 align:start position:0%
this 90 seconds
 
03:03:08.670 --> 03:03:08.680 align:start position:0%
ago um anything else um on any of the
 
03:03:13.950 --> 03:03:13.960 align:start position:0%
other Pages uh 34 35 and
 
03:03:17.269 --> 03:03:17.279 align:start position:0%
36 I do have something on 36 and
 
03:03:22.269 --> 03:03:22.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:24.469 --> 03:03:24.479 align:start position:0%
ahead I might just
 
03:03:27.670 --> 03:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
suggest I might just suggest uh adding
 
03:03:29.950 --> 03:03:29.960 align:start position:0%
suppressed treatments the the phrase
 
03:03:33.590 --> 03:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
suppressed treatments to the top of
 
03:03:37.630 --> 03:03:37.640 align:start position:0%
34 as as mentioning it as an equity
 
03:03:40.750 --> 03:03:40.760 align:start position:0%
measure at this point including vaccines
 
03:03:42.990 --> 03:03:43.000 align:start position:0%
monocon antibodies and suppressed
 
03:03:46.349 --> 03:03:46.359 align:start position:0%
treatments I like that and and it's it's
 
03:03:50.070 --> 03:03:50.080 align:start position:0%
there as the record um we've we've
 
03:03:51.790 --> 03:03:51.800 align:start position:0%
touched upon it under this Equity
 
03:03:55.910 --> 03:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
concern and then if an opportunity Rises
 
03:03:59.349 --> 03:03:59.359 align:start position:0%
then we can expand our uh investigation
 
03:04:02.750 --> 03:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
of that aspect El you know otherwise
 
03:04:04.950 --> 03:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
okay represent Bela then represent Penza
 
03:04:06.030 --> 03:04:06.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair if there's a
 
03:04:07.590 --> 03:04:07.600 align:start position:0%
commune desired to I think we could find
 
03:04:09.190 --> 03:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
a place to add that I don't think it
 
03:04:11.469 --> 03:04:11.479 align:start position:0%
belongs under Equity measures the state
 
03:04:13.790 --> 03:04:13.800 align:start position:0%
and federal government only took two
 
03:04:15.550 --> 03:04:15.560 align:start position:0%
specific Equity measures that we have in
 
03:04:17.830 --> 03:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
our record those measures related to
 
03:04:20.269 --> 03:04:20.279 align:start position:0%
vaccines where certain I believe it was
 
03:04:23.469 --> 03:04:23.479 align:start position:0%
10% were withheld for administration on
 
03:04:26.710 --> 03:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
the base of race and uh monoclonal
 
03:04:29.229 --> 03:04:29.239 align:start position:0%
antibodies from which the federal FDA
 
03:04:31.510 --> 03:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
administered guidelines that included
 
03:04:34.229 --> 03:04:34.239 align:start position:0%
significant biases in race there were no
 
03:04:36.469 --> 03:04:36.479 align:start position:0%
other uh suppression yes there was
 
03:04:38.950 --> 03:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
suppression but none of that falls under
 
03:04:42.190 --> 03:04:42.200 align:start position:0%
Equity measures uh represent
 
03:04:46.269 --> 03:04:46.279 align:start position:0%
Penza so I know we have it's under e
 
03:04:48.349 --> 03:04:48.359 align:start position:0%
right in on page 34 we're talking about
 
03:04:51.269 --> 03:04:51.279 align:start position:0%
Equity measures but I will have to say
 
03:04:53.590 --> 03:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
like suppressed treatments could go in
 
03:04:56.790 --> 03:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
there if in a little broader spe because
 
03:05:00.550 --> 03:05:00.560 align:start position:0%
we have a we have a um an emergency
 
03:05:03.630 --> 03:05:03.640 align:start position:0%
order executive order that literally
 
03:05:07.349 --> 03:05:07.359 align:start position:0%
stopped a suppressed treatment which was
 
03:05:12.110 --> 03:05:12.120 align:start position:0%
um um inhalers albuterol as well as um
 
03:05:15.870 --> 03:05:15.880 align:start position:0%
hydroxy chloroquin and we basically cut
 
03:05:18.150 --> 03:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
that off for
 
03:05:21.510 --> 03:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
um everyone in the state so um because
 
03:05:24.870 --> 03:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
they said that there could be a um a
 
03:05:28.750 --> 03:05:28.760 align:start position:0%
shortage of that for elderly which was
 
03:05:31.710 --> 03:05:31.720 align:start position:0%
based upon nothing so I know it doesn't
 
03:05:34.469 --> 03:05:34.479 align:start position:0%
fall underneath the equity definition
 
03:05:36.950 --> 03:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
but a suppressed treatment did happen
 
03:05:39.550 --> 03:05:39.560 align:start position:0%
because of that specifically so that
 
03:05:41.670 --> 03:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
they were saying that there wasn't
 
03:05:43.670 --> 03:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily would be enough for people
 
03:05:46.870 --> 03:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
that are NE elderly in in in nursing
 
03:05:48.309 --> 03:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
homes and stuff like that which was
 
03:05:50.389 --> 03:05:50.399 align:start position:0%
based on nothing which was those
 
03:05:52.389 --> 03:05:52.399 align:start position:0%
treatments were important especially for
 
03:05:55.910 --> 03:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
folks that you know um could have had
 
03:06:00.110 --> 03:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
some early early treatment represent po
 
03:06:02.990 --> 03:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
off uh I agree and I would suggest
 
03:06:05.670 --> 03:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
mentioning suppressed treatment either
 
03:06:08.070 --> 03:06:08.080 align:start position:0%
in G ongoing health impact on New
 
03:06:11.030 --> 03:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or even better in chapter
 
03:06:14.389 --> 03:06:14.399 align:start position:0%
number four that we just uh inserted
 
03:06:17.269 --> 03:06:17.279 align:start position:0%
with recommendation for uh continuation
 
03:06:20.030 --> 03:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
of the this committee we may mention
 
03:06:22.150 --> 03:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
that we need to look into suppressed
 
03:06:24.910 --> 03:06:24.920 align:start position:0%
treatments as well and maybe that's
 
03:06:26.150 --> 03:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
where it belongs is in the
 
03:06:29.590 --> 03:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
recommendation section um representative
 
03:06:32.550 --> 03:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
wary uh there might be an opportunity to
 
03:06:34.630 --> 03:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
briefly mention supress treatments under
 
03:06:38.030 --> 03:06:38.040 align:start position:0%
the censorship paragraph under on page
 
03:06:42.269 --> 03:06:42.279 align:start position:0%
32 because I think that
 
03:06:42.279 --> 03:06:44.870 align:start position:0%
32 because I think that
um

03:06:44.870 --> 03:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:51.670 --> 03:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:51.680 --> 03:06:53.349 align:start position:0%
 
perhaps

03:06:53.349 --> 03:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
03:06:57.229 --> 03:06:57.239 align:start position:0%
um perhaps in the in this paragraph that
 
03:06:59.990 --> 03:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
starts further comma censorship is now
 
03:07:03.870 --> 03:07:03.880 align:start position:0%
known blah blah blah um if if we go down
 
03:07:06.950 --> 03:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
to the final sentence and perhaps um
 
03:07:09.750 --> 03:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
insert a brief sentence saying something
 
03:07:12.710 --> 03:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
censorship also extended to suppressed
 
03:07:15.469 --> 03:07:15.479 align:start position:0%
treatments period that's perfect I think
 
03:07:18.750 --> 03:07:18.760 align:start position:0%
that's perfect perfect and I I think I
 
03:07:20.870 --> 03:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
think you found the perfect spot for it
 
03:07:24.590 --> 03:07:24.600 align:start position:0%
so any objections
 
03:07:28.070 --> 03:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
discussion censorship and executive
 
03:07:31.110 --> 03:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
censorship and executive
 
03:07:33.469 --> 03:07:33.479 align:start position:0%
action add executive action in there
 
03:07:36.229 --> 03:07:36.239 align:start position:0%
because it wasn't just censorship they
 
03:07:38.429 --> 03:07:38.439 align:start position:0%
actually took executive
 
03:07:40.950 --> 03:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
action put both that put both that in
 
03:07:43.190 --> 03:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
there in that sentence I think the I
 
03:07:45.309 --> 03:07:45.319 align:start position:0%
think it conflates it but represent
 
03:07:45.319 --> 03:07:47.870 align:start position:0%
think it conflates it but represent
where

03:07:47.870 --> 03:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:07:50.550 --> 03:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
the censorship came through executive
 
03:07:55.910 --> 03:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
action so um so it would
 
03:07:55.920 --> 03:07:58.710 align:start position:0%
action so um so it would
be

03:07:58.710 --> 03:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:07:58.720 --> 03:08:00.309 align:start position:0%
be
censorship

03:08:00.309 --> 03:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
censorship
 
03:08:05.429 --> 03:08:05.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:07.670 --> 03:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
treatments which were censored by
 
03:08:09.630 --> 03:08:09.640 align:start position:0%
executive action something like that
 
03:08:09.640 --> 03:08:22.910 align:start position:0%
executive action something like that
maybe

03:08:22.910 --> 03:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:25.309 --> 03:08:25.319 align:start position:0%
please if I may so just to read that
 
03:08:28.389 --> 03:08:28.399 align:start position:0%
whole actually um I'll just read the
 
03:08:30.590 --> 03:08:30.600 align:start position:0%
last sentence of that paragraph um which
 
03:08:33.030 --> 03:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
is right before the last paragraph in
 
03:08:33.040 --> 03:08:33.670 align:start position:0%
is right before the last paragraph in
that

03:08:33.670 --> 03:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:08:37.110 --> 03:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
section sentence uh adds censorship
 
03:08:38.469 --> 03:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
efforts included suppression of
 
03:08:39.910 --> 03:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
treatments and information around
 
03:08:41.670 --> 03:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
potential treatments for covid-19 that
 
03:08:47.630 --> 03:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:52.950 --> 03:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
yes yes okay excellent uh anything else
 
03:08:59.110 --> 03:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
uh we're 35 36 36 I have something
 
03:09:04.110 --> 03:09:04.120 align:start position:0%
on so on 36 the first sentence reads we
 
03:09:05.670 --> 03:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
receive substantial testimony and
 
03:09:07.630 --> 03:09:07.640 align:start position:0%
evidence on the topic of long covid a
 
03:09:09.190 --> 03:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
variable condition thought to be brought
 
03:09:11.590 --> 03:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
on by various toxic components of
 
03:09:11.600 --> 03:09:13.469 align:start position:0%
on by various toxic components of
covid-19

03:09:13.469 --> 03:09:13.479 align:start position:0%
covid-19
 
03:09:16.269 --> 03:09:16.279 align:start position:0%
infection I do believe in testimony and
 
03:09:18.070 --> 03:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
I could be wrong
 
03:09:21.870 --> 03:09:21.880 align:start position:0%
that the ratio of those with just covid
 
03:09:24.710 --> 03:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
and those of those vaccinated who reive
 
03:09:27.630 --> 03:09:27.640 align:start position:0%
covid uh those with the that were
 
03:09:29.910 --> 03:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
vaccinated um the percentage is much
 
03:09:31.710 --> 03:09:31.720 align:start position:0%
higher of them developing covid I think
 
03:09:33.750 --> 03:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
it was 85% to
 
03:09:38.190 --> 03:09:38.200 align:start position:0%
15% so um I think on the evidence of the
 
03:09:40.870 --> 03:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if just saying that
 
03:09:40.880 --> 03:09:42.229 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if just saying that
covid

03:09:42.229 --> 03:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
covid
 
03:09:44.750 --> 03:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
please thank you madam chair I think
 
03:09:46.870 --> 03:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
what you're referring to might be the
 
03:09:50.710 --> 03:09:50.720 align:start position:0%
rate of developing particularly
 
03:09:53.510 --> 03:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
myocarditis but I don't have the exact
 
03:09:56.269 --> 03:09:56.279 align:start position:0%
number on top of my head as far
 
03:10:00.870 --> 03:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
as um where that came in although
 
03:10:02.710 --> 03:10:02.720 align:start position:0%
perhaps we could add something more
 
03:10:02.720 --> 03:10:03.750 align:start position:0%
perhaps we could add something more
General

03:10:03.750 --> 03:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
General
 
03:10:07.710 --> 03:10:07.720 align:start position:0%
that certain um certain uh issues were
 
03:10:11.030 --> 03:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
more uh prevalent among the vaccinated
 
03:10:13.790 --> 03:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
group or or maybe we just had received
 
03:10:15.590 --> 03:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
substantial te testimony and evidence on
 
03:10:18.269 --> 03:10:18.279 align:start position:0%
the topic of long covid a variable
 
03:10:19.469 --> 03:10:19.479 align:start position:0%
condition thought to be brought on by
 
03:10:22.110 --> 03:10:22.120 align:start position:0%
various toxic components of covid-19
 
03:10:24.870 --> 03:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
including those that were vaccinated
 
03:10:27.830 --> 03:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
correct um and maybe that's where what
 
03:10:30.389 --> 03:10:30.399 align:start position:0%
you put in
 
03:10:33.349 --> 03:10:33.359 align:start position:0%
because it's it's long thought that if
 
03:10:35.070 --> 03:10:35.080 align:start position:0%
you were vaccinated you were kind of
 
03:10:38.070 --> 03:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
immune from everything but that was the
 
03:10:40.790 --> 03:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
original thought represent
 
03:10:44.990 --> 03:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
poens yeah this is a really good catch
 
03:10:47.790 --> 03:10:47.800 align:start position:0%
um there's two types of long Co right
 
03:10:50.830 --> 03:10:50.840 align:start position:0%
now that has been documented for well
 
03:10:54.349 --> 03:10:54.359 align:start position:0%
over um well over a year you know we're
 
03:10:56.990 --> 03:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
probably on you know um upwards of a
 
03:11:01.070 --> 03:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
year and a half now um from doctors and
 
03:11:04.190 --> 03:11:04.200 align:start position:0%
and experts all over the country so that
 
03:11:06.150 --> 03:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
long Co is two things right some people
 
03:11:08.990 --> 03:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
that got very very sick from covid and
 
03:11:12.070 --> 03:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
having those after effects as well as
 
03:11:16.990 --> 03:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
long Co is is through um folks that were
 
03:11:19.830 --> 03:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
in sense vaccine injured um some of them
 
03:11:22.630 --> 03:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
had covid and some of them didn't and so
 
03:11:25.670 --> 03:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
I I really believe that including all of
 
03:11:29.710 --> 03:11:29.720 align:start position:0%
that in that um in that first line is
 
03:11:31.830 --> 03:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
important uh and the reason I brought
 
03:11:34.389 --> 03:11:34.399 align:start position:0%
that up is because Dr vau when he was
 
03:11:37.349 --> 03:11:37.359 align:start position:0%
here I asked him the percentage of his
 
03:11:40.510 --> 03:11:40.520 align:start position:0%
patients that he was treating with long
 
03:11:42.269 --> 03:11:42.279 align:start position:0%
covid were vaccinated and those that
 
03:11:45.910 --> 03:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
were not and he said 15% of the long Co
 
03:11:47.590 --> 03:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
his long covid patients were were not
 
03:11:51.150 --> 03:11:51.160 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and 85% of them were um and
 
03:11:52.790 --> 03:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
that's where I came up with that
 
03:11:55.269 --> 03:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
information uh represent B thank you
 
03:11:57.070 --> 03:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
madam chair I I think I just understood
 
03:11:58.429 --> 03:11:58.439 align:start position:0%
what what exactly you you were talking
 
03:12:01.469 --> 03:12:01.479 align:start position:0%
about the trouble is for us to make a
 
03:12:06.190 --> 03:12:06.200 align:start position:0%
statement that is um fairly Final on
 
03:12:10.269 --> 03:12:10.279 align:start position:0%
that based on that number alone is is
 
03:12:11.830 --> 03:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
something that because correlation is
 
03:12:14.510 --> 03:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
not necess equal causation we don't know
 
03:12:16.309 --> 03:12:16.319 align:start position:0%
the relative numbers of people who are
 
03:12:19.070 --> 03:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
vaxed in the pop ation versus those in
 
03:12:21.030 --> 03:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
his clinic so we wouldn't actually be
 
03:12:23.910 --> 03:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
able to draw final conclusions as to
 
03:12:25.630 --> 03:12:25.640 align:start position:0%
rates or
 
03:12:25.640 --> 03:12:28.070 align:start position:0%
rates or
percentages

03:12:28.070 --> 03:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
percentages
 
03:12:30.990 --> 03:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
um and and it may well be the case that
 
03:12:33.750 --> 03:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
that the numbers are are you know linked
 
03:12:35.190 --> 03:12:35.200 align:start position:0%
to the numbers who are just generally
 
03:12:37.389 --> 03:12:37.399 align:start position:0%
vaccinating the population in which case
 
03:12:38.710 --> 03:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
those numbers might actually not
 
03:12:40.190 --> 03:12:40.200 align:start position:0%
represent anything
 
03:12:42.630 --> 03:12:42.640 align:start position:0%
meaningful you know I will have to agree
 
03:12:46.510 --> 03:12:46.520 align:start position:0%
with you um and um another question is
 
03:12:48.150 --> 03:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
is seen as this was the last section we
 
03:12:49.670 --> 03:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
were going to add another section I
 
03:12:51.710 --> 03:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
believe uh we talked about it at the
 
03:12:55.269 --> 03:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
beginning um do you have that also
 
03:12:57.229 --> 03:12:57.239 align:start position:0%
unless there's any more discussion on
 
03:12:59.590 --> 03:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
this represent
 
03:13:02.030 --> 03:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
Penza yeah I would make two changes to
 
03:13:04.550 --> 03:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
that first paragraph on 36 where it says
 
03:13:06.990 --> 03:13:07.000 align:start position:0%
this committee has received I would take
 
03:13:10.070 --> 03:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
out substantial and just put testimony
 
03:13:12.630 --> 03:13:12.640 align:start position:0%
and then and then I keep the same thing
 
03:13:14.309 --> 03:13:14.319 align:start position:0%
because in the second sentence you say
 
03:13:16.950 --> 03:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
we have likewise received I take out
 
03:13:18.990 --> 03:13:19.000 align:start position:0%
that that's substantial testimony and
 
03:13:21.389 --> 03:13:21.399 align:start position:0%
evidence regarding vaccine chloridine
 
03:13:24.469 --> 03:13:24.479 align:start position:0%
injury um and illness uh which you could
 
03:13:27.389 --> 03:13:27.399 align:start position:0%
put in parentheses you know which is
 
03:13:29.990 --> 03:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
also being called long covid okay so I
 
03:13:31.790 --> 03:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
think that's kind of important too you
 
03:13:33.510 --> 03:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
don't have to do that if not and then
 
03:13:35.110 --> 03:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
also thought to be related to the toxic
 
03:13:37.309 --> 03:13:37.319 align:start position:0%
Sprite protein of SARS Koby 2 as well as
 
03:13:39.750 --> 03:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
possible harmful effects of MRA and
 
03:13:42.870 --> 03:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
Technology um so I I think you should
 
03:13:45.670 --> 03:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
take out substantial in both of those
 
03:13:47.670 --> 03:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
lines I would
 
03:13:51.510 --> 03:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
con represent where and and maybe just
 
03:13:53.870 --> 03:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
um to representative Pena's point is
 
03:13:58.590 --> 03:13:58.600 align:start position:0%
maybe under or after illness may be put
 
03:14:07.630 --> 03:14:07.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:12.309 --> 03:14:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:15.910 --> 03:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
off yeah if it's just onqu it might be
 
03:14:19.590 --> 03:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
fine I just wonder if we need to clarify
 
03:14:19.600 --> 03:14:21.150 align:start position:0%
fine I just wonder if we need to clarify
that

03:14:21.150 --> 03:14:21.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:14:25.309 --> 03:14:25.319 align:start position:0%
uh it's more like misdiagnosed as long
 
03:14:28.429 --> 03:14:28.439 align:start position:0%
Co so it's not necessarily definition of
 
03:14:31.510 --> 03:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
long Co but it's more like uh it's
 
03:14:34.590 --> 03:14:34.600 align:start position:0%
similar so sometimes it is misdiagnosed
 
03:14:38.550 --> 03:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:44.389 --> 03:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
Co so maybe in paresis we can uh say
 
03:14:47.229 --> 03:14:47.239 align:start position:0%
that um
 
03:14:49.790 --> 03:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes misdiagnosed as long
 
03:14:53.349 --> 03:14:53.359 align:start position:0%
co uh represent we maybe maybe just
 
03:14:58.150 --> 03:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
something like um illness uh open parent
 
03:15:01.110 --> 03:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
including what is often diagnosed as
 
03:15:03.950 --> 03:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
long covid yeah that' be great close
 
03:15:06.990 --> 03:15:07.000 align:start position:0%
parin I I don't necessarily disagree
 
03:15:09.269 --> 03:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
with it but unless we have that evidence
 
03:15:10.990 --> 03:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
in our record it's a speculative
 
03:15:13.910 --> 03:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
statement and I don't know that I like
 
03:15:17.830 --> 03:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
it okay
 
03:15:19.630 --> 03:15:19.640 align:start position:0%
no we do
 
03:15:23.110 --> 03:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
not okay um represent
 
03:15:27.110 --> 03:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
weary did did uh representative lucus
 
03:15:29.630 --> 03:15:29.640 align:start position:0%
talk about that at
 
03:15:33.269 --> 03:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
all she did she may have I don't
 
03:15:39.990 --> 03:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:44.870 --> 03:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
yeah it's been a lot of information um
 
03:15:47.750 --> 03:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
so once this is done I think we talked
 
03:15:50.269 --> 03:15:50.279 align:start position:0%
about adding another section after this
 
03:15:52.389 --> 03:15:52.399 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the hearing if you
 
03:15:59.349 --> 03:15:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:02.030 --> 03:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you madam chair um so I I
 
03:16:04.870 --> 03:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
believe the section is the conclusion um
 
03:16:08.070 --> 03:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
section four um or alternatively we can
 
03:16:09.710 --> 03:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
insert the minority statement here and
 
03:16:11.070 --> 03:16:11.080 align:start position:0%
make that section four make the
 
03:16:13.309 --> 03:16:13.319 align:start position:0%
conclusion section five either way f
 
03:16:15.630 --> 03:16:15.640 align:start position:0%
with me but anyway conclusion this
 
03:16:16.910 --> 03:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
committee has spent considerable time
 
03:16:18.229 --> 03:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
reviewing the events of the past several
 
03:16:19.990 --> 03:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
years with regards to the state's uh
 
03:16:21.830 --> 03:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
response to the pandemic receiving
 
03:16:23.750 --> 03:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
testimony and documents and making
 
03:16:25.590 --> 03:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
recommendations for future for the
 
03:16:27.750 --> 03:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
future to the benefit of the state
 
03:16:29.950 --> 03:16:29.960 align:start position:0%
however very much remains to be reviewed
 
03:16:31.510 --> 03:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
assessed and many more recommendations
 
03:16:33.269 --> 03:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
are likely to result as a consequence of
 
03:16:36.030 --> 03:16:36.040 align:start position:0%
further inquiry because of this this
 
03:16:37.550 --> 03:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
committee recommends and concludes that
 
03:16:39.830 --> 03:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
our work is not yet concluded with the
 
03:16:42.110 --> 03:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
issues with the issues in this report
 
03:16:44.030 --> 03:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
and recommends that consideration be
 
03:16:45.790 --> 03:16:45.800 align:start position:0%
given that this committee be reinstated
 
03:16:48.790 --> 03:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
in the new house session of 2025 2026 to
 
03:16:50.469 --> 03:16:50.479 align:start position:0%
continue toward these ends and to the
 
03:16:52.590 --> 03:16:52.600 align:start position:0%
benefit of the citizens in New Hampshire
 
03:16:53.870 --> 03:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
further it is recommended that the
 
03:16:55.550 --> 03:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
mission parameters of this committee be
 
03:16:57.189 --> 03:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
slightly amended to open up the scope of
 
03:16:58.910 --> 03:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
inquiry such that a more complete
 
03:17:00.349 --> 03:17:00.359 align:start position:0%
picture be available to the members of
 
03:17:02.910 --> 03:17:02.920 align:start position:0%
the public to the members and to the
 
03:17:05.870 --> 03:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
public I have one go ahead and represent
 
03:17:09.229 --> 03:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
poent yeah I have one change so where
 
03:17:09.239 --> 03:17:17.150 align:start position:0%
poent yeah I have one change so where
you

03:17:17.150 --> 03:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:18.790 --> 03:17:18.800 align:start position:0%
where it says because of this the
 
03:17:21.229 --> 03:17:21.239 align:start position:0%
committee recommends and concludes that
 
03:17:23.389 --> 03:17:23.399 align:start position:0%
our work is not yet concluded let's use
 
03:17:25.030 --> 03:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
it so without saying conclude and
 
03:17:28.349 --> 03:17:28.359 align:start position:0%
conclude let's just um because of this
 
03:17:31.349 --> 03:17:31.359 align:start position:0%
the committee recommend recommends and
 
03:17:35.750 --> 03:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
has decided or whatever or come to a
 
03:17:37.510 --> 03:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
consensus or whatever it may be that our
 
03:17:39.349 --> 03:17:39.359 align:start position:0%
work is not yet concluded so just so
 
03:17:42.469 --> 03:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
we're not saying that or or maybe we we
 
03:17:45.349 --> 03:17:45.359 align:start position:0%
we maybe we say that
 
03:17:48.150 --> 03:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
ongoing uh
 
03:17:50.550 --> 03:17:50.560 align:start position:0%
information still needs something to
 
03:17:53.710 --> 03:17:53.720 align:start position:0%
that needs to be uh gathered and
 
03:17:55.110 --> 03:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
represented where we go ahead and word
 
03:17:59.309 --> 03:17:59.319 align:start position:0%
Smith that please just the uh on ongoing
 
03:18:03.070 --> 03:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
investigation of this needs to
 
03:18:05.950 --> 03:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
continue right in a science-based fact
 
03:18:05.960 --> 03:18:10.590 align:start position:0%
continue right in a science-based fact
finding

03:18:10.590 --> 03:18:10.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:12.950 --> 03:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
manner okay and I would like to thank
 
03:18:15.710 --> 03:18:15.720 align:start position:0%
represent Telles for being so patient
 
03:18:18.429 --> 03:18:18.439 align:start position:0%
with us
 
03:18:20.830 --> 03:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
um because she has some changes uh and
 
03:18:22.670 --> 03:18:22.680 align:start position:0%
then I'll get to you representative p is
 
03:18:25.510 --> 03:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
off um but representative tell has some
 
03:18:26.870 --> 03:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
changes she'd like to make to her
 
03:18:30.510 --> 03:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:32.790 --> 03:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
also thank you I already I already made
 
03:18:34.269 --> 03:18:34.279 align:start position:0%
them to the electronic version I'm going
 
03:18:36.309 --> 03:18:36.319 align:start position:0%
to just show this to you I'll review
 
03:18:37.750 --> 03:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
what it what they were but let me hand
 
03:18:46.950 --> 03:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:49.790 --> 03:18:49.800 align:start position:0%
so I'll review a few typographical
 
03:18:52.150 --> 03:18:52.160 align:start position:0%
things if you want to look at your um
 
03:18:54.830 --> 03:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
print out from earlier so in the first
 
03:18:58.630 --> 03:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
sentence I added an S to the Democratic
 
03:19:00.950 --> 03:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
members um
 
03:19:02.990 --> 03:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
the the
 
03:19:05.510 --> 03:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
um where is
 
03:19:10.189 --> 03:19:10.199 align:start position:0%
it I deleted a a comma in the last
 
03:19:14.469 --> 03:19:14.479 align:start position:0%
sentence uh right before was
 
03:19:17.189 --> 03:19:17.199 align:start position:0%
difficult and then in the paragraph we
 
03:19:19.469 --> 03:19:19.479 align:start position:0%
discussed a lot where it mentions the co
 
03:19:21.990 --> 03:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
after action report I just substituted a
 
03:19:25.070 --> 03:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
a everywhere in that
 
03:19:27.550 --> 03:19:27.560 align:start position:0%
paragraph and um where it says please
 
03:19:29.469 --> 03:19:29.479 align:start position:0%
see attachment B I just made the
 
03:19:33.550 --> 03:19:33.560 align:start position:0%
sentence for the AAR removing the
 
03:19:36.510 --> 03:19:36.520 align:start position:0%
parenthetical and then finally in the
 
03:19:39.229 --> 03:19:39.239 align:start position:0%
last sentence the a was not
 
03:19:42.990 --> 03:19:43.000 align:start position:0%
alone um I removed in New Hampshire part
 
03:19:44.630 --> 03:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
because it got it was kind of confusing
 
03:19:46.750 --> 03:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
so the AAR was not alone in concluding
 
03:19:48.229 --> 03:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire's Co response was
 
03:19:51.510 --> 03:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
sound is sort of how the sentence ended
 
03:19:54.750 --> 03:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
up and so if that seems okay because
 
03:19:56.510 --> 03:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
it's just sort of grammatical things I
 
03:20:00.309 --> 03:20:00.319 align:start position:0%
will email I I think they are PF yeah I
 
03:20:02.189 --> 03:20:02.199 align:start position:0%
I think they're fine in rep and PS off
 
03:20:04.389 --> 03:20:04.399 align:start position:0%
you had something else you want to
 
03:20:09.229 --> 03:20:09.239 align:start position:0%
say no um if there's any other further
 
03:20:12.710 --> 03:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
recommendations or changes uh if not I
 
03:20:17.269 --> 03:20:17.279 align:start position:0%
would like to have a vote on the report
 
03:20:19.110 --> 03:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
um well so I I have a procedural
 
03:20:20.950 --> 03:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
question yes yeah my understanding is
 
03:20:23.630 --> 03:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
that we vote on your report and then I
 
03:20:25.670 --> 03:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
