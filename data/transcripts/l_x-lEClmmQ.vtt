so representative where I know you've
 
00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 align:start position:0%
made uh some changes already to the
 
00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:40.439 align:start position:0%
draft report that we've received you
 
00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:42.439 align:start position:0%
have suggested changes uh if you would
 
00:03:45.429 --> 00:03:45.439 align:start position:0%
like to uh go over those and if anybody
 
00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
else has anything uh they would like to
 
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 align:start position:0%
free yes
 
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
oh um
 
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
yes yes
 
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
um you go over
 
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
as I I think we should go over each
 
00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
section individually and then suggest
 
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
changes so that everyone has a a chance
 
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 align:start position:0%
to discuss what they feel needs to be
 
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
changed or uh if there's any opposing
 
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 align:start position:0%
opinions or things that needed to be
 
00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
added Etc so um
 
00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:31.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 align:start position:0%
me representative evil I think it would
 
00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:44.759 align:start position:0%
be helpful for um representative beler
 
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
just as a starting point to kind of
 
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
outline his thought process anything he
 
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 align:start position:0%
might want to say uh about the drafting
 
00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
of this sure just to sort of introduce
 
00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
it yeah and I and I think this should be
 
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
a pretty informal hearing so that we can
 
00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 align:start position:0%
just have like a a a conversation
 
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:21.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:24.639 align:start position:0%
email thank you Madame chair and uh
 
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for um asking me to uh to
 
00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 align:start position:0%
introduce the draft report
 
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 align:start position:0%
um this was a significant process to get
 
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
this uh draft completed um relying on a
 
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 align:start position:0%
combination of input from the committee
 
00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 align:start position:0%
um trying to break it out into different
 
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.160 align:start position:0%
sections that would make sense um in
 
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
order to be reasonably comprehensive
 
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
while not unnecessarily repetitive um
 
00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
spend a lot of time balancing ideas uh
 
00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:00.759 align:start position:0%
for specific
 
00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 align:start position:0%
language uh so we have uh the the
 
00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:06.919 align:start position:0%
breakdown is three major sections with
 
00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
each section containing um multiple
 
00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:12.759 align:start position:0%
subsections the first section uh being
 
00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:15.160 align:start position:0%
the introduction section the
 
00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:17.199 align:start position:0%
acknowledgements which is basically just
 
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
a a broad overview outline and
 
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
sentiments around what we um have seen
 
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
and the way that we have undertaken this
 
00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
evaluation noting for you know such
 
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
things that we're not undertaking this
 
00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:35.639 align:start position:0%
with an eye toward um being unreasonable
 
00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:38.199 align:start position:0%
we want to understand what happened as
 
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
it happened what was known at the time
 
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
not just utilizing hindsight which
 
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
should be 2020 um but giving people the
 
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
benefit of the fact that there was a lot
 
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
of Doubt uncertainty and fear involved
 
00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.080 align:start position:0%
in this whole process um outlining our
 
00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
mission uh a summary of findings which
 
00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:01.400 align:start position:0%
really is just a brief breakdown of the
 
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.029 align:start position:0%
really is just a brief breakdown of the
findings

00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:03.039 align:start position:0%
findings
 
00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:06.039 align:start position:0%
um as far as our mission statement goes
 
00:07:08.909 --> 00:07:08.919 align:start position:0%
relating to efficacy what efficacy means
 
00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:12.520 align:start position:0%
what the goals were um a brief note on
 
00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:15.879 align:start position:0%
the executive after Action Report which
 
00:07:18.749 --> 00:07:18.759 align:start position:0%
um notes that the after Action Report
 
00:07:21.469 --> 00:07:21.479 align:start position:0%
has certain utility in certain areas
 
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
especially things like some
 
00:07:25.309 --> 00:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
Communications and inter-government
 
00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
functions um but it's also not exactly
 
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:30.440 align:start position:0%
scientifically oriented so it does have
 
00:07:32.589 --> 00:07:32.599 align:start position:0%
limited utility in certain other
 
00:07:37.309 --> 00:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
areas um major section two policy areas
 
00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
goes through subsections of uh setting
 
00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:43.400 align:start position:0%
goals talks about how goals were set um
 
00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:46.360 align:start position:0%
what was testified to the committee as
 
00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
far as what the goals were at different
 
00:07:51.469 --> 00:07:51.479 align:start position:0%
times during the pandemic period uh
 
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
section B the level of disruption that
 
00:07:57.309 --> 00:07:57.319 align:start position:0%
um the state's actions cause to
 
00:07:59.790 --> 00:07:59.800 align:start position:0%
individuals um so individual citizens
 
00:08:02.189 --> 00:08:02.199 align:start position:0%
residents of the State of New Hampshire
 
00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
uh item C the level of economic
 
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
disruption that resulted from uh these
 
00:08:13.149 --> 00:08:13.159 align:start position:0%
actions D um education which is pretty
 
00:08:16.469 --> 00:08:16.479 align:start position:0%
broad encompassing um the the fact that
 
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
we uh as a state perhaps not as a state
 
00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:22.840 align:start position:0%
but more as local entities um shut down
 
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:25.400 align:start position:0%
schools for extended periods of time um
 
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
that there was
 
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
conflicting um basis for
 
00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.630 align:start position:0%
conflicting um basis for
opening

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:32.640 align:start position:0%

period of time during the pandemic
 
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:46.200 align:start position:0%
especially the the most um significant
 
00:08:47.829 --> 00:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
period of government actions which would
 
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
have been during the 2020 to 2021 mid
 
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:53.120 align:start position:0%

MRNA prophylactic technology that we've
 
00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:08.120 align:start position:0%
had various testimony as to whether
 
00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
those should technically be called
 
00:10:11.389 --> 00:10:11.399 align:start position:0%
vaccines or not I I didn't intend to
 
00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
weigh in on whether they are so I wanted
 
00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
to make sure it was all
 
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
encompassing e uh having to do with the
 
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
equity measures that were taken by the
 
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire government F uh
 
00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:25.720 align:start position:0%
on engineering controls and actually I
 
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
found this to be one of the most
 
00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:29.480 align:start position:0%
interesting items that we saw and
 
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps one of the most important
 
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
recommendations going
 
00:10:37.949 --> 00:10:37.959 align:start position:0%
forward um regarding the
 
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
the the fact that public health
 
00:10:43.949 --> 00:10:43.959 align:start position:0%
authorities seem to be reticent to
 
00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:47.720 align:start position:0%
recommend a high dollar policy that
 
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
might have had a very might have had a
 
00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:52.360 align:start position:0%
great degree of success just because it
 
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
was a high dollar policy and trying to
 
00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
solve in the future policy decisions
 
00:10:58.910 --> 00:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
regarding spending money when it may
 
00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:02.120 align:start position:0%
actually necessary to do so um and
 
00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:05.240 align:start position:0%
finally G the ongoing impacts uh on the
 
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
health of New Hampshire residents uh as
 
00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:10.040 align:start position:0%
was recommended by the committee last
 
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
week in our Friday session um making
 
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
recommendations or asking our federal
 
00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
delegation perhaps to uh look at ongoing
 
00:11:23.829 --> 00:11:23.839 align:start position:0%
um study and funding for uh long covid
 
00:11:25.069 --> 00:11:25.079 align:start position:0%
and the vaccine
 
00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
injured so that's the overall outline um
 
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
and happy to go through it bit by bit if
 
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:45.310 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:45.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:47.670 align:start position:0%
 
very

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:11:50.629 --> 00:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
um uh Madam chair and and committee
 
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
Members First of all I just want to say
 
00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:56.680 align:start position:0%
again that um this has been a uh quite a
 
00:11:59.629 --> 00:11:59.639 align:start position:0%
journey I think for all of us I I think
 
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
that we came to this committee probably
 
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
with quite different ideas and beliefs
 
00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
as to how the as to how the uh covid
 
00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
response rolled out um we've heard a lot
 
00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.750 align:start position:0%
response rolled out um we've heard a lot
of

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
testimony um I've talked to my fellow
 
00:12:22.949 --> 00:12:22.959 align:start position:0%
and I just want to say that I can see
 
00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
that there was an extraordinarily amount
 
00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
huge amount of effort that
 
00:12:29.189 --> 00:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
representative beler put in in in
 
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
drafting this it very much reflects um
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
his opinion of the of of the testimony
 
00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:43.000 align:start position:0%
that we received um I've talked to uh
 
00:12:45.389 --> 00:12:45.399 align:start position:0%
the other members they were not able to
 
00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
come today
 
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
unfortunately um I would just say as a
 
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
general statement we have many many
 
00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:56.680 align:start position:0%
points of
 
00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
disagreement um with the report
 
00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
um I'm willing I mean I can we can walk
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
through this and and look at the
 
00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
language honestly I feel like it's going
 
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
to be incredibly difficult for us to
 
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
come to a consensus in a way that we
 
00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:18.440 align:start position:0%
would be able to sign off on it because
 
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
I think we just basically disagree with
 
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
um a lot of the statements and
 
00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
conclusions um I you know so just for
 
00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:32.680 align:start position:0%
what it's worth uh we can stay we can
 
00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:36.680 align:start position:0%
say that that I think there's
 
00:13:39.629 --> 00:13:39.639 align:start position:0%
some anyway I'll just leave it at that I
 
00:13:42.949 --> 00:13:42.959 align:start position:0%
I just want to keep it at a a respectful
 
00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:45.800 align:start position:0%
level and just I wanted to say that on
 
00:13:48.829 --> 00:13:48.839 align:start position:0%
behalf of the democratic members of the
 
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
committee thank you and uh represent
 
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
Merchant did send out uh an email to to
 
00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
the members which I appreciate um let me
 
00:13:59.189 --> 00:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
ask a question
 
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:14:04.829 --> 00:14:04.839 align:start position:0%
introduction is any is that an issue uh
 
00:14:07.269 --> 00:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
of this I mean I'm just trying to find
 
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
out um I know uh representative we's
 
00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
made out uh made some changes um that he
 
00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.519 align:start position:0%
felt because he thought you know it was
 
00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
more represent we what do why don't you
 
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:21.600 align:start position:0%

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
haven't seen that email come through yet
 
00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:26.629 align:start position:0%
haven't seen that email come through yet
um

00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:29.560 align:start position:0%
uh okay go ahead
 
00:14:32.509 --> 00:14:32.519 align:start position:0%
yes my apologies the uh system has not
 
00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
been kind to me this morning okay okay
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
so give you a few more minutes
 
00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
representative po
 
00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
off uh I have a question to the chair if
 
00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:46.600 align:start position:0%
you can could outline um the process
 
00:14:49.829 --> 00:14:49.839 align:start position:0%
that we are engaging right now uh our
 
00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
deadlines and process uh um uh we heard
 
00:14:56.949 --> 00:14:56.959 align:start position:0%
about signing off on report is it a
 
00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:01.160 align:start position:0%
process that is ahead of us and uh I
 
00:15:03.949 --> 00:15:03.959 align:start position:0%
understand that there are some uh uh
 
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
grammatical um uh suggestions and some
 
00:15:11.069 --> 00:15:11.079 align:start position:0%
undertones that uh we want to change in
 
00:15:13.389 --> 00:15:13.399 align:start position:0%
the report but I also think it's
 
00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
important that we will finish with the
 
00:15:20.949 --> 00:15:20.959 align:start position:0%
report uh so that uh we we don't miss a
 
00:15:23.629 --> 00:15:23.639 align:start position:0%
deadline and there was some uh different
 
00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
opinions about when the deadline is and
 
00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:30.839 align:start position:0%
if we are able to continue our meetings
 
00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
after today so if you have any
 
00:15:34.269 --> 00:15:34.279 align:start position:0%
information on
 
00:15:37.829 --> 00:15:37.839 align:start position:0%
that um I did not check with the uh
 
00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:40.600 align:start position:0%
speaker's office but our report did not
 
00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:42.440 align:start position:0%
have a deadline in there and it is a
 
00:15:44.189 --> 00:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
special committee and a standing
 
00:15:47.309 --> 00:15:47.319 align:start position:0%
committee so one I don't know don't
 
00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
think that today is a deadline we are
 
00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:50.920 align:start position:0%
all elected officials until I think
 
00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:55.480 align:start position:0%
December 3rd um so as elected officials
 
00:15:57.509 --> 00:15:57.519 align:start position:0%
we can still function I think in a
 
00:15:59.550 --> 00:15:59.560 align:start position:0%
capacity of producing a report
 
00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
I can double check with the speaker's
 
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
office on that quickly um but I think
 
00:16:07.749 --> 00:16:07.759 align:start position:0%
it's important that we go through this
 
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
and um and I know that you've made some
 
00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:13.880 align:start position:0%
changes representative weary that you
 
00:16:16.629 --> 00:16:16.639 align:start position:0%
felt that were necessary um for the tone
 
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
of this report um but first off I don't
 
00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:23.560 align:start position:0%
think I think that we need to recognize
 
00:16:25.949 --> 00:16:25.959 align:start position:0%
that represent representative beler
 
00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
taking on this under task I mean we all
 
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
have our biases um so when we write
 
00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
things we have to understand that that
 
00:16:33.199 --> 00:16:35.110 align:start position:0%
things we have to understand that that
happens

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
happens
 
00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:37.480 align:start position:0%
and the tremendous amount of work that
 
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
he has put into this um to get us to
 
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
this point I think really needs to be
 
00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:48.680 align:start position:0%
acknowledged um definitely uh so we now
 
00:16:50.629 --> 00:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
have something that we can work with so
 
00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
I think you
 
00:16:55.749 --> 00:16:55.759 align:start position:0%
know if we can go through maybe section
 
00:16:58.269 --> 00:16:58.279 align:start position:0%
by section um you know let's just look
 
00:17:01.069 --> 00:17:01.079 align:start position:0%
at the introdu C ction and then and then
 
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
if you have notes on different sections
 
00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:05.000 align:start position:0%
on where you think that there there's
 
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
problems or maybe represented where
 
00:17:08.189 --> 00:17:08.199 align:start position:0%
already has suggestions that may be
 
00:17:08.199 --> 00:17:09.789 align:start position:0%
already has suggestions that may be
amendable

00:17:09.789 --> 00:17:09.799 align:start position:0%
amendable
 
00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
to um we can hear those I think it's
 
00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
important that we hear what um we hear
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
uh what the issues are and what uh
 
00:17:20.949 --> 00:17:20.959 align:start position:0%
suggestions are already uh out there to
 
00:17:25.949 --> 00:17:25.959 align:start position:0%
be made so um so you know I agree with
 
00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:28.120 align:start position:0%
you that this was an enormous task and I
 
00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:30.760 align:start position:0%
also uh thank representative Belcher for
 
00:17:34.029 --> 00:17:34.039 align:start position:0%
taking it on and putting it all together
 
00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:37.880 align:start position:0%
um I we got it I mean I'm not causing F
 
00:17:41.549 --> 00:17:41.559 align:start position:0%
I'm just saying we got it late it was uh
 
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
an extremely long and comprehensive
 
00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
document I did
 
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
not make specific comments on the
 
00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:52.520 align:start position:0%
language because there was just so many
 
00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
points of disagreement I didn't I wasn't
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
like in the process of of editing it um
 
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
I would I mean I can look at the
 
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
introduction again now I just you know
 
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:05.320 align:start position:0%
like I guess what I'm saying is I read
 
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
through the thing the the document I
 
00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
didn't go back through and make notes I
 
00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
just sort of paid attention I think
 
00:18:14.549 --> 00:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
obviously we can agree on the on the
 
00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:17.039 align:start position:0%
mission I'll look at the introduction
 
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
again but I think after that that's
 
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
where we begin to start to uh separate
 
00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
um structurally usually what I've seen
 
00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:30.440 align:start position:0%
is like
 
00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
um text and then like bullet points with
 
00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
a bunch of specific findings and then
 
00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
after that you have a recommendation
 
00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
section and then it it goes on from
 
00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:43.720 align:start position:0%
there I've seen much more
 
00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
footnoting um you know references we're
 
00:18:48.669 --> 00:18:48.679 align:start position:0%
going to need some
 
00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
appendices just technically speaking you
 
00:18:54.149 --> 00:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
talk about the the people that came and
 
00:18:57.549 --> 00:18:57.559 align:start position:0%
testified um you know that part of it
 
00:18:59.669 --> 00:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether we agree to it or
 
00:19:02.909 --> 00:19:02.919 align:start position:0%
not I would recommend that it be beefed
 
00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
up if um if possible so anyway just with
 
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
overview any thoughts from the
 
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
committee represent
 
00:19:17.669 --> 00:19:17.679 align:start position:0%
Bel thank you madam chair and I
 
00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:19.919 align:start position:0%
appreciate all of the the comments that
 
00:19:21.909 --> 00:19:21.919 align:start position:0%
have been made um I just wanted to
 
00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
outline because we did have um a
 
00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
discussion in a broad sense about what
 
00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
the report ought to perhaps look like
 
00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
and include this past Friday um I did
 
00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
very much try to be cognizant of all
 
00:19:37.909 --> 00:19:37.919 align:start position:0%
those things and including those
 
00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:40.600 align:start position:0%
including um some things that we I
 
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
really went out of my way to try to make
 
00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:46.799 align:start position:0%
um amable to all parties that I I've not
 
00:19:49.149 --> 00:19:49.159 align:start position:0%
included any names of persons um
 
00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
references are by title or by Branch
 
00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
only uh nobody in the report is
 
00:19:56.909 --> 00:19:56.919 align:start position:0%
disparaged or thrown under the bus in in
 
00:19:59.230 --> 00:19:59.240 align:start position:0%
any way um
 
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
there are no recommendations for
 
00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
punitive measures or actions or anything
 
00:20:05.549 --> 00:20:05.559 align:start position:0%
of that sort it's all forward-looking
 
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
um in all circumstances it was
 
00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
considered what was known at the time
 
00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
trying very hard not to apply what we
 
00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
might know now to judge actions at the
 
00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
time based on what they may not have
 
00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
known at the time
 
00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
um we agreed I think as a as a committee
 
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
this past Friday that um when the state
 
00:20:29.789 --> 00:20:29.799 align:start position:0%
is going to be adopted any sort of uh
 
00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:32.600 align:start position:0%
official state position uh when it comes
 
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
down especially from the federal level
 
00:20:36.789 --> 00:20:36.799 align:start position:0%
or anywhere else that we really ought to
 
00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
be putting in the effort to
 
00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:42.520 align:start position:0%
independently verify um that guidance
 
00:20:44.789 --> 00:20:44.799 align:start position:0%
before we put our stamp as a state on it
 
00:20:46.549 --> 00:20:46.559 align:start position:0%
and our legitimacy as a state government
 
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:48.440 align:start position:0%
on it
 
00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
um it is noted many many many times that
 
00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:56.120 align:start position:0%
the a lot of our response was dictated
 
00:20:59.909 --> 00:20:59.919 align:start position:0%
guided or otherwise um
 
00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
marshaled by federal authorities and not
 
00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
by individuals or any parties or
 
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
branches of government within the state
 
00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:13.880 align:start position:0%
um and lastly the the the findings for
 
00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
um long Co and vaccine injury that we
 
00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
discussed were also included in there
 
00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:54.149 --> 00:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
weary just please jump in um a question
 
00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
to represent F thank you for sending uh
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
the draft is it um a version with
 
00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
accepted changes because I I don't
 
00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:06.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily see on my system but my
 
00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
system is
 
00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:11.480 align:start position:0%
different yes yes it is with the I
 
00:22:13.149 --> 00:22:13.159 align:start position:0%
thought it would be easier for this
 
00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
committee rather
 
00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.430 align:start position:0%
committee rather
than

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
um I I can send a if if someone wants
 
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
represent weary because we're not seeing
 
00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
anything in red because obviously uh can
 
00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:38.200 align:start position:0%
you discuss your changes please for
 
00:22:40.549 --> 00:22:40.559 align:start position:0%
us um I it looks like you put the
 
00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:42.520 align:start position:0%
mission first which I think is
 
00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:45.750 align:start position:0%
mission first which I think is
important

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
um um bear bear with me for a second
 
00:22:51.269 --> 00:22:51.279 align:start position:0%
while I open up I I
 
00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
did I can send a track changes version
 
00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
but it's pretty messy um but so
 
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
um basically I did move the the mission
 
00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
to the top of the report I thought that
 
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
was best and I thought um you know I've
 
00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:14.200 align:start position:0%
particularly noted in my reviews of the
 
00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:16.360 align:start position:0%
videos early on before I joined the
 
00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
committee as well as after I joined the
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
committee uh substituting for
 
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
representative leus that you know you
 
00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
open up every meeting with this mission
 
00:23:29.269 --> 00:23:29.279 align:start position:0%
statement and I think it it's important
 
00:23:33.149 --> 00:23:33.159 align:start position:0%
for um you know reviewers of this report
 
00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
to understand this specific Mission so I
 
00:23:39.029 --> 00:23:39.039 align:start position:0%
thought it would be best to move that um
 
00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:43.480 align:start position:0%
and then I included the metrics that um
 
00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
just in terms of the hours of of public
 
00:23:48.909 --> 00:23:48.919 align:start position:0%
hearings and the documented thousands of
 
00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:52.520 align:start position:0%
pages that sort of thing and uh include
 
00:23:54.789 --> 00:23:54.799 align:start position:0%
that then I identified you know the
 
00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
composition of the committee and then I
 
00:23:59.350 --> 00:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
listed with uh
 
00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
the chair and the vice chair first and
 
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
then I just simply put in alphabetical
 
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
order uh represent weary there is one
 
00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
change and I I didn't catch it uh and
 
00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
looking at represent belches but it's
 
00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
Kelly penzer and not Nikki Carter so
 
00:24:18.029 --> 00:24:18.039 align:start position:0%
Kelly penzer is should be listed instead
 
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:21.240 align:start position:0%
of Nikki mcarter okay um
 
00:24:33.789 --> 00:24:33.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
so so
 
00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:39.240 align:start position:0%
so Kelly Kelly uh representative Penza
 
00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:42.520 align:start position:0%
is listed um
 
00:24:45.269 --> 00:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
below uh in the second column if you
 
00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
look at that so you'll need to remove
 
00:24:50.389 --> 00:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
Nicki mcarter okay um so there's got to
 
00:24:53.669 --> 00:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:56.200 align:start position:0%
somewhere please Madam chair if I just
 
00:24:58.389 --> 00:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
uh if this is the same and I think
 
00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
probably is what I had I had just
 
00:25:02.269 --> 00:25:02.279 align:start position:0%
included all persons even substitutes
 
00:25:04.549 --> 00:25:04.559 align:start position:0%
that were on the committee during uh any
 
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
period of time um if we prefer not to
 
00:25:10.149 --> 00:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
that's that's fine as well
 
00:25:12.789 --> 00:25:12.799 align:start position:0%
um just the official memb should be on
 
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
there I think is important um um and if
 
00:25:19.909 --> 00:25:19.919 align:start position:0%
I may real quick on page seven uh
 
00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:22.520 align:start position:0%
representative weary uh near the bottom
 
00:25:26.789 --> 00:25:26.799 align:start position:0%
there is an odd paragraph ending um I I
 
00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:28.360 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that's addressed
 
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
before I forget about it and move on
 
00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:34.120 align:start position:0%
from it okay on the copy I sent let me
 
00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:50.269 --> 00:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
that please yes there are 12 names so
 
00:25:53.549 --> 00:25:53.559 align:start position:0%
once we remove Niki Mar we are good baby
 
00:25:56.149 --> 00:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
and representative weary I mean we can
 
00:25:59.830 --> 00:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
always put uh
 
00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:01.880 align:start position:0%
somewhere Alicia Le is then replaced
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
with representative weary um is is that
 
00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
because that was official but uh
 
00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
represent mcarter was only a substitute
 
00:26:12.789 --> 00:26:12.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:14.669 --> 00:26:14.679 align:start position:0%
so did you understand that
 
00:26:14.679 --> 00:26:20.070 align:start position:0%
so did you understand that
representative

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:23.789 --> 00:26:23.799 align:start position:0%
wary if I wasn't originally appointed so
 
00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:26.360 align:start position:0%
what we would like to say is have
 
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative leus there and then
 
00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
um when she was no longer on the
 
00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
committee replaced with representative
 
00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
weary so that people understand that she
 
00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:41.240 align:start position:0%
was the official member and then you
 
00:26:42.789 --> 00:26:42.799 align:start position:0%
took over as an official member but
 
00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
we're replacing
 
00:26:49.029 --> 00:26:49.039 align:start position:0%
her I I'm I I leave it up to uh Mr Bel
 
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
representative belker to
 
00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:54.520 align:start position:0%
uh okay make that adjustment if
 
00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
he would please right because then you
 
00:26:59.630 --> 00:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
did become a an official member of the
 
00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:01.880 align:start position:0%
committee that's that was my
 
00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:13.750 align:start position:0%
committee that's that was my
understanding

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:17.080 align:start position:0%
yes uh yeah yeah yes representative Bel
 
00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
I think is talking about page seven if
 
00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
you go to the for of Fifth Line from the
 
00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
bottom you can see that uh paragraph uh
 
00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:00.269 --> 00:28:00.279 align:start position:0%
okay um I'm just noting what
 
00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant said about
 
00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:05.720 align:start position:0%
calling out the membership situation I
 
00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
mean you could do that I guess but I
 
00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
think that uh all of us who did not come
 
00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
had a very specific conflict and we all
 
00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
knew heading into this that Fridays were
 
00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
going to be really difficult for us and
 
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
you know if you want to put that in
 
00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
there uh if we're not signing off on the
 
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
thing that's your prerogative but it
 
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
seems like um
 
00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:32.440 align:start position:0%
an unnecessary jab representative weary
 
00:28:40.149 --> 00:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:42.789 --> 00:28:42.799 align:start position:0%
out so in the in then in the new draft
 
00:28:51.509 --> 00:28:51.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:51.519 --> 00:28:53.630 align:start position:0%
 
removed

00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
removed
 
00:28:56.029 --> 00:28:56.039 align:start position:0%
um represent Bel thank you madam chair
 
00:28:58.710 --> 00:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
and just as a as as a quick sort of
 
00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:02.440 align:start position:0%
um formatting question uh I would note
 
00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
that the the last edit of the version
 
00:29:06.909 --> 00:29:06.919 align:start position:0%
that I put out that was distributed
 
00:29:10.149 --> 00:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
yesterday was ultimately a bit longer in
 
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
length because there was each section
 
00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
sort of had it its own page or it was
 
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
each section started on a new page um
 
00:29:19.149 --> 00:29:19.159 align:start position:0%
whereas this new one we're looking at
 
00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:22.120 align:start position:0%
right now uh uh provided by
 
00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
representative weary uh it retains the
 
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
older formatting where it's shorter
 
00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:28.840 align:start position:0%
because it's not broken up in that
 
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
manner is there a preference that we
 
00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:32.120 align:start position:0%
have for which way we ought to go with
 
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
that I I thought I thought better of it
 
00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:36.200 align:start position:0%
and when I edit it maybe each section
 
00:29:38.549 --> 00:29:38.559 align:start position:0%
starting on its own page but I I I just
 
00:29:38.559 --> 00:29:39.669 align:start position:0%
starting on its own page but I I I just
was

00:29:39.669 --> 00:29:39.679 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
curious maybe it it's cleaner that way I
 
00:29:45.789 --> 00:29:45.799 align:start position:0%
I agree uh with each section on its own
 
00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:48.440 align:start position:0%
page um especially when you're flipping
 
00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
through an
 
00:29:53.389 --> 00:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
index um but you know listening to what
 
00:29:55.789 --> 00:29:55.799 align:start position:0%
representative eel said and represent
 
00:29:58.830 --> 00:29:58.840 align:start position:0%
merch and uh citing some of um uh our
 
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
findings and putting in footnotes and
 
00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
having addendums might be should
 
00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:08.360 align:start position:0%
probably be put into this report
 
00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:10.840 align:start position:0%
please thank you madam chair uh just to
 
00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
address that and I I don't disagree that
 
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
it would ideally have all of those
 
00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:20.120 align:start position:0%
things um the the difficulty for me was
 
00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:21.190 align:start position:0%
things um the the difficulty for me was
we

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:30:25.149 --> 00:30:25.159 align:start position:0%
have literally thousands of pages of
 
00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
documents in our committee records and
 
00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
and without the Staffing that somebody
 
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
like Congress has it it was just an
 
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
impossible task for me to try to cite
 
00:30:41.509 --> 00:30:41.519 align:start position:0%
which is why where there was any any
 
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
necessary really necessary citation I
 
00:30:49.669 --> 00:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
record again
 
00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's up to you how you guys
 
00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:56.600 align:start position:0%
want to handle this I mean if you're
 
00:30:59.629 --> 00:30:59.639 align:start position:0%
quoting in the I mean I I believe we
 
00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
just had one environmental engineer here
 
00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:04.600 align:start position:0%
and if a lot of what you're quoting is
 
00:31:06.629 --> 00:31:06.639 align:start position:0%
what he said then you could reference
 
00:31:09.549 --> 00:31:09.559 align:start position:0%
him um some of the other statements that
 
00:31:12.669 --> 00:31:12.679 align:start position:0%
were made came directly from say
 
00:31:15.909 --> 00:31:15.919 align:start position:0%
attorney Siri or Dr korf as an
 
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
individual I think we could reference
 
00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
those um we could at least have a
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
hyperlink to the AR report just you know
 
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
maybe if it's supposed supposed to be
 
00:31:31.389 --> 00:31:31.399 align:start position:0%
somewhat scientific document uh or
 
00:31:33.509 --> 00:31:33.519 align:start position:0%
summarizing science it would be good to
 
00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
have some of those things but of course
 
00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:37.480 align:start position:0%
we also have we can have an appendix
 
00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:39.880 align:start position:0%
that's what I've done before and we can
 
00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
list some of the documents and maybe
 
00:31:44.509 --> 00:31:44.519 align:start position:0%
just references to them I appreciate
 
00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:46.360 align:start position:0%
what you're saying representative belter
 
00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
it' be a tremendous amount of work but
 
00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:51.320 align:start position:0%
maybe we could add a few more things or
 
00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:04.200 align:start position:0%
so I guess under under on represent
 
00:32:06.789 --> 00:32:06.799 align:start position:0%
War's report did you make any changes to
 
00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:15.669 align:start position:0%
 
section

00:32:15.669 --> 00:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:18.669 --> 00:32:18.679 align:start position:0%
okay that would be the first
 
00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:27.509 --> 00:32:27.519 align:start position:0%
did uh put on your mic please um why I
 
00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:29.960 align:start position:0%
did with respect to the acknowledgements
 
00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
is um I I took much of what was written
 
00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:36.389 align:start position:0%
is um I I took much of what was written
but

00:32:36.389 --> 00:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:39.880 align:start position:0%
um uh kind of rewarded it for
 
00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:43.919 align:start position:0%
readability I um
 
00:32:43.919 --> 00:32:47.230 align:start position:0%
readability I um
and

00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:47.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:49.549 --> 00:32:49.559 align:start position:0%
uh uh it looks like you shortened it a
 
00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:51.880 align:start position:0%
little bit I I did okay why don't I just
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
read that section on what you changed
 
00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
and see how it sounds to folks and uh
 
00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:01.320 align:start position:0%
get an opinion um at the onset of this
 
00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:03.320 align:start position:0%
report is important to recognize the
 
00:33:06.269 --> 00:33:06.279 align:start position:0%
unprecedented nature of the covid-19
 
00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
pandemic initially extraordinary little
 
00:33:11.029 --> 00:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
was known about the virus the potential
 
00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
degree of lethality and the rate of
 
00:33:14.909 --> 00:33:14.919 align:start position:0%
transmissibility were being reported as
 
00:33:14.919 --> 00:33:16.509 align:start position:0%
transmissibility were being reported as
extremely

00:33:16.509 --> 00:33:16.519 align:start position:0%
extremely
 
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
high throughout Society there was a
 
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
palpable fear that was exasperated by
 
00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
the media's constant reporting of the
 
00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
number of deaths that occurred due to
 
00:33:28.509 --> 00:33:28.519 align:start position:0%
covid-19 indeed covid-19 and fear became
 
00:33:30.909 --> 00:33:30.919 align:start position:0%
twin viruses infecting
 
00:33:32.909 --> 00:33:32.919 align:start position:0%
Society because of the threat of the
 
00:33:35.029 --> 00:33:35.039 align:start position:0%
virus and the growing sense of fear and
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
dread New Hampshire State officials no
 
00:33:39.549 --> 00:33:39.559 align:start position:0%
doubt felt an enormous responsibility to
 
00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:41.480 align:start position:0%
protect its citizens and to keep Granite
 
00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:44.360 align:start position:0%
Staters alive and healthy to this end
 
00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
the governor formed a committee of top
 
00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
state leaders from several branches of
 
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
the state government to chart a path
 
00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
forward to contain the spread of the
 
00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
novel virus a well-known risk mitigation
 
00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:57.240 align:start position:0%
approach for hazard prevention the Swiss
 
00:33:59.310 --> 00:33:59.320 align:start position:0%
cheese model was enacted to mitigate the
 
00:34:02.149 --> 00:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
spread of the virus decisions had to be
 
00:34:05.149 --> 00:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
made quickly often times and I don't
 
00:34:07.029 --> 00:34:07.039 align:start position:0%
know if often times is one word but
 
00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
should be separated
 
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
um with minimal and or conflicting
 
00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
information and the pressures and
 
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
challenges of making such decisions were
 
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
enormous ultimately the decision by the
 
00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:20.720 align:start position:0%
committee in this approach were arguably
 
00:34:22.629 --> 00:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
prudent measures to protect the people
 
00:34:25.629 --> 00:34:25.639 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire in undertaking a review
 
00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
of these actions to mitigate the spread
 
00:34:30.149 --> 00:34:30.159 align:start position:0%
of Co 19 virus this house committee
 
00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
recognizes that decisions made during
 
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
the pandemic were done under immense
 
00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:37.240 align:start position:0%
pressure with the information available
 
00:34:40.109 --> 00:34:40.119 align:start position:0%
at the time accordingly this committee
 
00:34:41.669 --> 00:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
has endeavored to determine how New
 
00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can do better next time rather
 
00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:45.560 align:start position:0%
than indiscriminately second-guessing
 
00:34:48.869 --> 00:34:48.879 align:start position:0%
the decisions made with the 2020
 
00:34:51.109 --> 00:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
hindsight furthermore this committee
 
00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:53.000 align:start position:0%
also recognizes that New Hampshire had a
 
00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
much lower mortality rate in comparison
 
00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
to other states on behalf of the people
 
00:34:59.750 --> 00:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire we F feel compelled to
 
00:35:02.109 --> 00:35:02.119 align:start position:0%
express appreciation to many officials
 
00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
elected leaders and New Hampshire
 
00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
citizens who made difficult decisions
 
00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
under difficult circumstances to see New
 
00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire through the other side of the
 
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
pandemic it is the decision in genuine
 
00:35:15.310 --> 00:35:15.320 align:start position:0%
efforts of these many people for which
 
00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
the granted State owes a debt of
 
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
gratitude we also extend our thanks to
 
00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:22.200 align:start position:0%

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
information and offered unique
 
00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:42.440 align:start position:0%
perspectives having made these
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
acknowledgements this report now returns
 
00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
to the committee's mission to carefully
 
00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
review the decisions made and evaluate
 
00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
the actions taken to identify what we
 
00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
might have done differently to better
 
00:35:54.309 --> 00:35:54.319 align:start position:0%
protect the overall health and
 
00:35:56.309 --> 00:35:56.319 align:start position:0%
well-being of the people of New
 
00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
done it carries with it an
 
00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
acknowledgment of extreme circumstances
 
00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
and the high degree of work um that the
 
00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
folks at the in the executive branch
 
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
frankly did and in the municipalities to
 
00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
get us where we were so I mean I'll I
 
00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
I'll read through it again but but
 
00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
yeah right and and I think even in uh
 
00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
represent belur and my original thing
 
00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
was we wanted to make sure that everyone
 
00:36:40.829 --> 00:36:40.839 align:start position:0%
understood that we're looking at this as
 
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
in hindsight that we weren't living
 
00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
through that and we weren't dealing with
 
00:36:47.829 --> 00:36:47.839 align:start position:0%
that and we have to be very thankful and
 
00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
grateful so well and I think we could we
 
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
could say something about you know this
 
00:36:56.309 --> 00:36:56.319 align:start position:0%
is being done um to the best of our
 
00:36:59.190 --> 00:36:59.200 align:start position:0%
abilities Rec recognizing the
 
00:37:01.829 --> 00:37:01.839 align:start position:0%
limitations of
 
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
our committee and Staffing and whatever
 
00:37:06.589 --> 00:37:06.599 align:start position:0%
we could also say something like that
 
00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
but you know whatever um I think I think
 
00:37:12.589 --> 00:37:12.599 align:start position:0%
it has a good
 
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
tone I can represent P off so suggest
 
00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:22.040 align:start position:0%
correction we we we list titles for most
 
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
of the mentioned people but not for
 
00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
Patria and quick search shows that
 
00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
she I I think she is a associate
 
00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:37.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner so so we we can the title
 
00:37:39.349 --> 00:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
that's right and I think if we put their
 
00:37:42.829 --> 00:37:42.839 align:start position:0%
full names like I don't know what Dr
 
00:37:42.839 --> 00:37:45.190 align:start position:0%
full names like I don't know what Dr
cuor

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
cuor
 
00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:49.000 align:start position:0%
name so uh yeah so we need to fix that
 
00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
put uh associate Commissioners uh
 
00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
Patricia Tilly or Tilly uh and then it
 
00:37:58.150 --> 00:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
would be Dr Martin kof if we're putting
 
00:37:59.430 --> 00:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
in the full
 
00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
names um yeah Taylor Caswell I don't
 
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
know who all I don't have it in front of
 
00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
me right so Taylor casell Frank
 
00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
edelblute I don't know what Dr Benjamin
 
00:38:14.109 --> 00:38:14.119 align:start position:0%
Benjamin Ben Dr Benjamin and I'd have to
 
00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
look up director Buxton and we can say
 
00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
and many others who we did not have the
 
00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:19.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to hear from but certainly
 
00:38:22.109 --> 00:38:22.119 align:start position:0%
were in the trenches or something like
 
00:38:24.069 --> 00:38:24.079 align:start position:0%
that I mean I think they all really
 
00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:25.720 align:start position:0%
knock themselves
 
00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
out right and I think and many other
 
00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:30.680 align:start position:0%
citizens Who provided valuable right so
 
00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
I think uh and I think they were all
 
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
recognized at the at the beginning too
 
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:36.200 align:start position:0%
so I think but these were the people
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
that came and testified before our
 
00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:40.910 align:start position:0%
that came and testified before our
committee

00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:44.440 align:start position:0%
specifically representative P off uh I
 
00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
have a question to the
 
00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:50.680 align:start position:0%
committee uh so I think it's most of us
 
00:38:54.349 --> 00:38:54.359 align:start position:0%
uh heard about uh the Swiss chese model
 
00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
here for the first time so uh if we hear
 
00:39:00.589 --> 00:39:00.599 align:start position:0%
I characterize it as a well-known risk
 
00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
mitigation approach for hazard
 
00:39:08.109 --> 00:39:08.119 align:start position:0%
prevention is it actually welln or or
 
00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:11.560 align:start position:0%
not just a thought maybe we could have
 
00:39:13.589 --> 00:39:13.599 align:start position:0%
um you know a footnote at the bottom or
 
00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
something that talks what swiss cheese
 
00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
method and what that meant just so some
 
00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:21.839 align:start position:0%
okay thank well or maybe just not call
 
00:39:24.589 --> 00:39:24.599 align:start position:0%
it that call it a variety of mitigation
 
00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
measures or something like that just I
 
00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
don't I don't have it in front of me so
 
00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:32.440 align:start position:0%
uh we're just quoting uh right um
 
00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
associate commissioner uh Tilly that she
 
00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
said that several times times so uh
 
00:39:40.349 --> 00:39:40.359 align:start position:0%
represent weary uh Dr Chan also
 
00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned it several times and as a uh
 
00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
someone with a long history in quality
 
00:39:50.829 --> 00:39:50.839 align:start position:0%
and Regulatory in the pharmaceutical and
 
00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
bi biotech and medical device Industries
 
00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
I've been familiar with this for a long
 
00:39:58.950 --> 00:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
long time and so uh we constantly use
 
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
that sort of model when talking about
 
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
risks uh you know aseptic processing
 
00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
Sterile Processing other scenarios like
 
00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
that so it is well known at least in
 
00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:13.480 align:start position:0%
some Industries and I think in the in
 
00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
the fields you know like that Dr Chan
 
00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
would would frequent it should be
 
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.430 align:start position:0%
would would frequent it should be
familiar

00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
so okay so maybe a footnote just so
 
00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
would people um uh understand what that
 
00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:31.480 align:start position:0%
meant um thank
 
00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
you please I did I did provide an
 
00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
explanation of it so if you if you go
 
00:40:40.349 --> 00:40:40.359 align:start position:0%
the text now has that explanation so I
 
00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:42.640 align:start position:0%
thought any um there was another
 
00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
instance where say the r not value was
 
00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
discussed and so I I explained that I
 
00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
explained the Swiss Cheese model so that
 
00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
I I felt those two and maybe one other
 
00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:55.400 align:start position:0%
thing that doesn't come to mind right at
 
00:40:58.030 --> 00:40:58.040 align:start position:0%
the moment needed a
 
00:41:00.069 --> 00:41:00.079 align:start position:0%
um General explanation of a technical
 
00:41:03.589 --> 00:41:03.599 align:start position:0%
matter and so I I provided that in in my
 
00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
uh version of the report okay thank you
 
00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
perfect go ahead represent
 
00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:12.680 align:start position:0%
B thank you madam chair and just to I'm
 
00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:16.520 align:start position:0%
on currently on page 22 of 33 of the
 
00:41:20.430 --> 00:41:20.440 align:start position:0%
updated the the uh edited version um I'm
 
00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
on page
 
00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:24.280 align:start position:0%
six I just wanted to chime in and say uh
 
00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
thus far I am generally in agreement
 
00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:28.760 align:start position:0%
that it makes it a little bit easier to
 
00:41:30.069 --> 00:41:30.079 align:start position:0%
read it add some good information that
 
00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
is good uh thus far I would not have a
 
00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
problem with changing it to this version
 
00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:36.280 align:start position:0%
maybe reformatting a little bit but I
 
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
think it's pretty
 
00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:52.069 --> 00:41:52.079 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going scrolling here right so
 
00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:56.720 align:start position:0%
um go ahead represent where it yeah just
 
00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:58.109 align:start position:0%
um go ahead represent where it yeah just
um

00:41:58.109 --> 00:41:58.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:00.349 --> 00:42:00.359 align:start position:0%
I ju I'm not trying to Pat myself on the
 
00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:01.720 align:start position:0%
back but just for the record there's
 
00:42:04.589 --> 00:42:04.599 align:start position:0%
probably about 8 to 10 hours of editing
 
00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:07.000 align:start position:0%
in here so just just so people are aware
 
00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:10.079 align:start position:0%
I didn't casually look at this and blah
 
00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:11.800 align:start position:0%
blah blah you know I I really tried to
 
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
go through it and and
 
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh Prov provide some
 
00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
um I think style and and content updates
 
00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:24.680 align:start position:0%
to the excellent work that
 
00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:26.440 align:start position:0%
representative velker had already
 
00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:27.750 align:start position:0%
representative velker had already
provided

00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
provided
 
00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
I I I wonder if it would make sense so
 
00:42:33.349 --> 00:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
that we're all dealing with your
 
00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
document if we could ask house committee
 
00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
services to just make a copy for us
 
00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
because I don't send that right up there
 
00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:43.160 align:start position:0%
I can I'll send that right up and then I
 
00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
think that way we know we all are
 
00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:56.990 --> 00:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
okay otherwise it's really hard yes and
 
00:42:58.990 --> 00:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
I I no I would tend to agree with that
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
and seeing the knowing the original
 
00:43:02.829 --> 00:43:02.839 align:start position:0%
draft obviously and seeing the level of
 
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
changes that were made um almost every
 
00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:07.240 align:start position:0%
single sentence in here has at least
 
00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
small changes and improvements I think
 
00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:10.720 align:start position:0%
so it would be almost impossible to go
 
00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:12.280 align:start position:0%
through it as a side by side and say
 
00:43:14.109 --> 00:43:14.119 align:start position:0%
this is this is what changed it would be
 
00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
better just to deal with the edited
 
00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:22.549 --> 00:43:22.559 align:start position:0%
think but I
 
00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:25.400 align:start position:0%
um uh representative belker and I were
 
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
discussing this uh briefly earlier prior
 
00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:31.240 align:start position:0%
to the committee's convening and
 
00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
um um I'm not as loquacious as
 
00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:38.720 align:start position:0%
representative belker so my my uh
 
00:43:41.589 --> 00:43:41.599 align:start position:0%
sentences are a little shorter generally
 
00:43:41.599 --> 00:43:44.950 align:start position:0%
sentences are a little shorter generally
thank

00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:48.549 --> 00:43:48.559 align:start position:0%
you no no no no offense
 
00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
but I'm I like
 
00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:54.040 align:start position:0%
short and concise no I'm a business
 
00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
writer not a English be somewhat
 
00:43:58.990 --> 00:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
difficult for me because now the rest of
 
00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
my folks haven't necessarily seen this
 
00:44:03.589 --> 00:44:03.599 align:start position:0%
draft but you know we'll do the best we
 
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:10.480 align:start position:0%

now on page
 
00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
23 the the changes are
 
00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:23.880 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly stylistic and grammatical
 
00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
and taking my overwhelmingly
 
00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:27.750 align:start position:0%
and taking my overwhelmingly
philosophical

00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
philosophical
 
00:44:29.589 --> 00:44:29.599 align:start position:0%
style of writing and transforming into a
 
00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
more technical style of writing but the
 
00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:34.520 align:start position:0%
content um
 
00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:45.160 align:start position:0%

um on on your computer do you have where
 
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
you change things I mean I already see
 
00:57:21.710 --> 00:57:21.720 align:start position:0%
that there's a formatting change on some
 
00:57:25.549 --> 00:57:25.559 align:start position:0%
of it um you know with bullet points and
 
00:57:27.910 --> 00:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
things can already see
 
00:57:31.230 --> 00:57:31.240 align:start position:0%
that uh please represent beler apologies
 
00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
Madam chair I uh I seem to have two
 
00:57:34.789 --> 00:57:34.799 align:start position:0%
copies of the same document is that what
 
00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to be looking at uh well
 
00:57:40.270 --> 00:57:40.280 align:start position:0%
I had printed out a copy of yours um and
 
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
brought it with me and then we have a
 
00:57:46.349 --> 00:57:46.359 align:start position:0%
copy of Representative Wares and I
 
00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:48.640 align:start position:0%
believe representative eel printed out a
 
00:57:52.190 --> 00:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
copy of uh your report
 
00:57:54.990 --> 00:57:55.000 align:start position:0%
also so that we brought from home but
 
00:57:56.910 --> 00:57:56.920 align:start position:0%
please go ahead uh just to clarify
 
00:57:58.910 --> 00:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
because what I'm looking at are are
 
00:58:00.950 --> 00:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
exactly identical they are I think these
 
00:58:02.789 --> 00:58:02.799 align:start position:0%
are both the edited version by
 
00:58:02.799 --> 00:58:06.630 align:start position:0%
are both the edited version by
representative

00:58:06.630 --> 00:58:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:11.549 --> 00:58:11.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:14.029 --> 00:58:14.039 align:start position:0%
got no she printed out the right thing
 
00:58:16.670 --> 00:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
so one two three four five
 
00:58:21.230 --> 00:58:21.240 align:start position:0%
right an extra copy um of that so you
 
00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
have both you have the extra copy so got
 
00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:27.150 align:start position:0%
have both you have the extra copy so got
it

00:58:27.150 --> 00:58:27.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:58:30.029 --> 00:58:30.039 align:start position:0%
I don't know why I was thinking six but
 
00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
whatever so should I continue with the
 
00:58:36.309 --> 00:58:36.319 align:start position:0%
summary of findings so basically
 
00:58:44.430 --> 00:58:44.440 align:start position:0%
um I I I brought out the um I sort of
 
00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
relabeled Representative Bel belker
 
00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:48.640 align:start position:0%
introduced that there were kind of three
 
00:58:51.150 --> 00:58:51.160 align:start position:0%
primary objectives I sort of relabeled
 
00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
the second one because it was
 
00:58:57.109 --> 00:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
um I I think
 
00:58:58.230 --> 00:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
it it
 
00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
was Bas and I did this based on Dr
 
00:59:04.710 --> 00:59:04.720 align:start position:0%
Chan's discussion or testimony um
 
00:59:07.710 --> 00:59:07.720 align:start position:0%
because it's he talked about uh a
 
00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
genuine concern about the Health Care
 
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
system and infrastructure being
 
00:59:13.990 --> 00:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed and so slow the spread was
 
00:59:17.029 --> 00:59:17.039 align:start position:0%
the slogan or stop the spread or that
 
00:59:18.589 --> 00:59:18.599 align:start position:0%
sort of thing two weeks to stop the
 
00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
spread or slow the spread um but it but
 
00:59:24.349 --> 00:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
the purpose or objective was really to
 
00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
prevent the Health Care system and
 
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
infrast structure from being overwhelmed
 
00:59:31.109 --> 00:59:31.119 align:start position:0%
so um and then I thought it was helpful
 
00:59:34.150 --> 00:59:34.160 align:start position:0%
in this particular instance to really uh
 
00:59:36.109 --> 00:59:36.119 align:start position:0%
call them out as individual you know
 
00:59:39.789 --> 00:59:39.799 align:start position:0%
bullet points or numbered points so um
 
00:59:42.829 --> 00:59:42.839 align:start position:0%
so I I did that and
 
00:59:47.829 --> 00:59:47.839 align:start position:0%
um and and and then uh a lot of what is
 
00:59:47.839 --> 00:59:48.650 align:start position:0%
um and and and then uh a lot of what is
there

00:59:48.650 --> 00:59:48.660 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:59:48.660 --> 00:59:50.309 align:start position:0%
there
[Music]

00:59:50.309 --> 00:59:50.319 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:59:55.630 --> 00:59:55.640 align:start position:0%
in uh like the the paragraph with the
 
00:59:58.990 --> 00:59:59.000 align:start position:0%
that starts out the first major goal is
 
01:00:01.470 --> 01:00:01.480 align:start position:0%
basically takes the same content but
 
01:00:04.549 --> 01:00:04.559 align:start position:0%
just rewords it in
 
01:00:06.430 --> 01:00:06.440 align:start position:0%
um for
 
01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
readability um the
 
01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
paragraph uh on analysis of the efficacy
 
01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:15.720 align:start position:0%
of the response on toward the bottom of
 
01:00:19.270 --> 01:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
page six is basically again the same
 
01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:22.720 align:start position:0%
with a few minor rewords the paragraph
 
01:00:27.510 --> 01:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
that starts with the second goal
 
01:00:32.069 --> 01:00:32.079 align:start position:0%
is then that is um a more substantive
 
01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
change because I thought it was
 
01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:35.750 align:start position:0%
change because I thought it was
important

01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:37.430 align:start position:0%
important
to

01:00:37.430 --> 01:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
um explain
 
01:00:43.710 --> 01:00:43.720 align:start position:0%
that that the concern about the the
 
01:00:45.710 --> 01:00:45.720 align:start position:0%
concern about the overwhelming of the
 
01:00:48.670 --> 01:00:48.680 align:start position:0%
Health Care system and so that
 
01:00:53.069 --> 01:00:53.079 align:start position:0%
information is is uh Amplified and added
 
01:00:57.309 --> 01:00:57.319 align:start position:0%
to to a degree and and um I built it in
 
01:01:00.069 --> 01:01:00.079 align:start position:0%
terms of a sequential series of thoughts
 
01:01:03.069 --> 01:01:03.079 align:start position:0%
to kind of better explain why this was a
 
01:01:07.150 --> 01:01:07.160 align:start position:0%
concern and um then talked about some of
 
01:01:08.910 --> 01:01:08.920 align:start position:0%
the points that representative belker
 
01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
raised but I I for instance I labeled
 
01:01:14.069 --> 01:01:14.079 align:start position:0%
the the approach to gain additional time
 
01:01:15.870 --> 01:01:15.880 align:start position:0%
to improve treatments as sort of a
 
01:01:19.109 --> 01:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
secondary benefit but the the primary
 
01:01:21.390 --> 01:01:21.400 align:start position:0%
interest or purpose or goal or objective
 
01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:24.640 align:start position:0%
was indeed to uh prevent the Health Care
 
01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
system from being overwhelmed because
 
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
the the thought process was uh as I
 
01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
remember at least more recently from the
 
01:01:34.349 --> 01:01:34.359 align:start position:0%
testimony from Dr Chan was that there
 
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
was a a very much a concern that if this
 
01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
Health Care system was overwhelmed and
 
01:01:44.950 --> 01:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
was unable to help anyone at that point
 
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
because of a collapse of the Health Care
 
01:01:51.950 --> 01:01:51.960 align:start position:0%
System then um you know you you have um
 
01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
the catastrophe of the healthc Care
 
01:01:56.470 --> 01:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
infrastructure being collapsing on top
 
01:02:00.789 --> 01:02:00.799 align:start position:0%
of the virus pandemic so um so that's
 
01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:03.480 align:start position:0%
then explained uh you then have in
 
01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
starting at the top of page seven well
 
01:02:08.589 --> 01:02:08.599 align:start position:0%
that's a continue paragraph but um then
 
01:02:13.349 --> 01:02:13.359 align:start position:0%
I I broke out the the aspects of the
 
01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
federal level versus state level and in
 
01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
the paragraph that says at the federal
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
level then um then in the next one
 
01:02:28.390 --> 01:02:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:31.069 --> 01:02:31.079 align:start position:0%
uh that starts representatives of the
 
01:02:33.230 --> 01:02:33.240 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:02:35.230 --> 01:02:35.240 align:start position:0%
described the Swiss cheese M there in
 
01:02:38.549 --> 01:02:38.559 align:start position:0%
that particular paragraph I went into
 
01:02:41.630 --> 01:02:41.640 align:start position:0%
some uh great detail about what that
 
01:02:45.109 --> 01:02:45.119 align:start position:0%
analogy means and and so that the reader
 
01:02:49.630 --> 01:02:49.640 align:start position:0%
could better understand that then in
 
01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:51.390 align:start position:0%
could better understand that then in
the

01:02:51.390 --> 01:02:51.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:54.760 align:start position:0%
um in the final paragraph at the bottom
 
01:02:56.470 --> 01:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
of page seven
 
01:02:58.870 --> 01:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
um that is basically the again the same
 
01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
01:03:06.670 --> 01:03:06.680 align:start position:0%
um content but um largely
 
01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
reworded and then uh there were also
 
01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:11.750 align:start position:0%
reworded and then uh there were also
some

01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
um sections that probably were taken out
 
01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
at that point um just a quick note and I
 
01:03:19.309 --> 01:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
think this is what everyone was pointing
 
01:03:22.269 --> 01:03:22.279 align:start position:0%
to on page six was uh in in the
 
01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
paragraph that says Representatives at
 
01:03:26.349 --> 01:03:26.359 align:start position:0%
the very end of it it says accordingly
 
01:03:29.710 --> 01:03:29.720 align:start position:0%
this committee um so whatever you were
 
01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
thinking at that point um is not there
 
01:03:34.630 --> 01:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
and I believe representative evil wanted
 
01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:37.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:39.670 --> 01:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
comment answer that did you drop a
 
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
sentence or was it's just a weird
 
01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:47.349 align:start position:0%
sentence or was it's just a weird
paragraph

01:03:47.349 --> 01:03:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:50.549 --> 01:03:50.559 align:start position:0%
um let me uh give me just a moment thank
 
01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
you while you're looking I guess so I'm
 
01:03:55.829 --> 01:03:55.839 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at this and I'm trying to
 
01:03:59.549 --> 01:03:59.559 align:start position:0%
figure out what is the specific finding
 
01:04:03.990 --> 01:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
so you have goal one and I think the
 
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.910 align:start position:0%
so you have goal one and I think the
finding

01:04:06.910 --> 01:04:06.920 align:start position:0%
finding
 
01:04:09.710 --> 01:04:09.720 align:start position:0%
here uh is
 
01:04:12.670 --> 01:04:12.680 align:start position:0%
basically uh if the goal was to Halt the
 
01:04:14.430 --> 01:04:14.440 align:start position:0%
spread of the virus the objective was
 
01:04:16.789 --> 01:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
not achieved by the state correct and it
 
01:04:18.990 --> 01:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
says here the committee received no
 
01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
information or testimony that would lead
 
01:04:22.510 --> 01:04:22.520 align:start position:0%
us to believe that even a single
 
01:04:24.549 --> 01:04:24.559 align:start position:0%
resident of the state was spared in
 
01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
infection since since it first appeared
 
01:04:31.870 --> 01:04:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
finding I believe that is almost a
 
01:04:37.029 --> 01:04:37.039 align:start position:0%
direct quote from the right original
 
01:04:40.029 --> 01:04:40.039 align:start position:0%
report right so that's what I mean all
 
01:04:42.109 --> 01:04:42.119 align:start position:0%
I'm saying I'm trying to there there's
 
01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
the building of the argument and then
 
01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
there's the finding so I think that's
 
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
the finding the summary of the finding
 
01:04:52.950 --> 01:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
for the first goal so I I just I wanted
 
01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that was the the
 
01:04:58.269 --> 01:04:58.279 align:start position:0%
finding and then wherever I mean I
 
01:05:00.829 --> 01:05:00.839 align:start position:0%
haven't read it all we can find your
 
01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
specific finding or findings for the
 
01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:05.870 align:start position:0%
specific finding or findings for the
second

01:05:05.870 --> 01:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:08.470 align:start position:0%
second
goal

01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
goal
 
01:05:13.269 --> 01:05:13.279 align:start position:0%
uh um here we go the I so I think
 
01:05:16.829 --> 01:05:16.839 align:start position:0%
the the the finding to the second goal
 
01:05:16.839 --> 01:05:17.950 align:start position:0%
the the the finding to the second goal
really

01:05:17.950 --> 01:05:17.960 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:05:24.109 --> 01:05:24.119 align:start position:0%
begins at the top of page nine or toward
 
01:05:25.710 --> 01:05:25.720 align:start position:0%
the top of page nine maybe the first
 
01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
first or second paragraph because then
 
01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
the lastly in the middle of page n
 
01:05:34.190 --> 01:05:34.200 align:start position:0%
really gets start Begins the discussion
 
01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
of the third
 
01:05:38.069 --> 01:05:38.079 align:start position:0%
point and that that sort of follows
 
01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
repres representative belker's
 
01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
um wording and I just I kept that
 
01:05:49.230 --> 01:05:49.240 align:start position:0%
wording but uh tried to because it's a
 
01:05:51.109 --> 01:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
one of the longer sections of the report
 
01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
I tried to kind of uh keep with the
 
01:05:55.829 --> 01:05:55.839 align:start position:0%
first second and third but you know know
 
01:05:59.390 --> 01:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
introduce it as numbered points above um
 
01:06:05.470 --> 01:06:05.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:10.430 --> 01:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:14.109 --> 01:06:14.119 align:start position:0%
just thank you madam chair if I could uh
 
01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
just help to summarize a little bit what
 
01:06:17.069 --> 01:06:17.079 align:start position:0%
we're what we're discussing especially
 
01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:18.440 align:start position:0%
for anybody who might be watching at
 
01:06:22.109 --> 01:06:22.119 align:start position:0%
home um we're looking at the uh summary
 
01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
of findings regarding the efficacy of
 
01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:26.559 align:start position:0%
the government response
 
01:06:28.670 --> 01:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
now in order to determine whether or not
 
01:06:30.789 --> 01:06:30.799 align:start position:0%
the government response was efficacious
 
01:06:32.829 --> 01:06:32.839 align:start position:0%
whether it worked you first have to
 
01:06:35.190 --> 01:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
identify what the goal was so we've
 
01:06:37.470 --> 01:06:37.480 align:start position:0%
identified um rather I and
 
01:06:38.910 --> 01:06:38.920 align:start position:0%
representative weary and in his edit
 
01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
have identified several items that were
 
01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
repeatedly testified to us that
 
01:06:47.589 --> 01:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
represented goals during different
 
01:06:49.589 --> 01:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
points in the pandemic the first goal
 
01:06:52.069 --> 01:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
being that there was an attempt being
 
01:06:52.079 --> 01:06:53.470 align:start position:0%
being that there was an attempt being
made

01:06:53.470 --> 01:06:53.480 align:start position:0%
made
 
01:06:57.870 --> 01:06:57.880 align:start position:0%
to uh not merely mitigate but really um
 
01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
eliminate the spread of covid-19 uh the
 
01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
SARS CO2 virus in an attempt to actually
 
01:07:08.069 --> 01:07:08.079 align:start position:0%
not allow it to become endemic or native
 
01:07:11.549 --> 01:07:11.559 align:start position:0%
to the population um so that was goal
 
01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
number one uh as Dr Chan testified to uh
 
01:07:20.109 --> 01:07:20.119 align:start position:0%
in a very direct question on this it
 
01:07:22.829 --> 01:07:22.839 align:start position:0%
fairly quickly within couple months it
 
01:07:25.630 --> 01:07:25.640 align:start position:0%
seems became apparent to the authority
 
01:07:28.950 --> 01:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
ities involved that this was no longer
 
01:07:31.870 --> 01:07:31.880 align:start position:0%
something reasonable to try to achieve
 
01:07:34.430 --> 01:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
and the goal began shifting to a
 
01:07:37.789 --> 01:07:37.799 align:start position:0%
mitigation strategy in order to try to
 
01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
avoid there was several reasons that
 
01:07:43.150 --> 01:07:43.160 align:start position:0%
were given to try to avoid overwhelming
 
01:07:47.150 --> 01:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
our health care capacity in system um
 
01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
and to buy time for the further
 
01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:54.079 align:start position:0%
development of Therapeutics um
 
01:07:57.990 --> 01:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
prophylactics uh and such uh in order to
 
01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:00.119 align:start position:0%
ultimately have the effect of reducing
 
01:08:03.829 --> 01:08:03.839 align:start position:0%
morbidity and mortality of infection so
 
01:08:05.870 --> 01:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
those are the kind of overriding goals
 
01:08:07.589 --> 01:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
that were identified and then the rest
 
01:08:08.910 --> 01:08:08.920 align:start position:0%
goes on to
 
01:08:11.950 --> 01:08:11.960 align:start position:0%
analyze based on testimony and data
 
01:08:15.789 --> 01:08:15.799 align:start position:0%
we've received um what that looked like
 
01:08:18.149 --> 01:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
and whether or not It ultimately worked
 
01:08:20.110 --> 01:08:20.120 align:start position:0%
which in many cases it does not appear
 
01:08:21.950 --> 01:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
to of at the very least we can say that
 
01:08:23.870 --> 01:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
there wasn't evidence presented to us in
 
01:08:25.709 --> 01:08:25.719 align:start position:0%
any sort of data format that could ident
 
01:08:28.149 --> 01:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
identify any particular measure that we
 
01:08:31.709 --> 01:08:31.719 align:start position:0%
took that actually was effective in
 
01:08:44.669 --> 01:08:44.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:46.669 --> 01:08:46.679 align:start position:0%
goals okay it's going to take a little
 
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
bit for us to go uh through this and
 
01:08:52.470 --> 01:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
read it
 
01:08:57.189 --> 01:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
um again uh
 
01:08:59.470 --> 01:08:59.480 align:start position:0%
uh he said that on page nine where it
 
01:09:03.550 --> 01:09:03.560 align:start position:0%
said lastly that would be the third
 
01:09:06.189 --> 01:09:06.199 align:start position:0%
Point related
 
01:09:09.149 --> 01:09:09.159 align:start position:0%
finding the third Point okay let's
 
01:09:09.159 --> 01:09:13.430 align:start position:0%
finding the third Point okay let's
see

01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
um uh so what representative e eel is
 
01:09:21.030 --> 01:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
asking is that uh the third goal um that
 
01:09:24.189 --> 01:09:24.199 align:start position:0%
was stated we know that it's it starts
 
01:09:26.309 --> 01:09:26.319 align:start position:0%
on page nine
 
01:09:29.309 --> 01:09:29.319 align:start position:0%
uh on what we must examine but where was
 
01:09:31.550 --> 01:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
the committee's findings on
 
01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:39.510 align:start position:0%
the committee's findings on
that

01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:45.269 --> 01:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:01.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
recommendations begin at the bottom of
 
01:10:08.110 --> 01:10:08.120 align:start position:0%
page 10 the top or the bottom two
 
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
paragraphs are where uh it states like
 
01:10:13.990 --> 01:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
the committee recommends I see where it
 
01:10:15.790 --> 01:10:15.800 align:start position:0%
says the committee recommends further
 
01:10:17.550 --> 01:10:17.560 align:start position:0%
investigation second paragraph from the
 
01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
bottom yeah page 10 yeah so those would
 
01:10:23.590 --> 01:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
be I think sort of the findings there's
 
01:10:26.669 --> 01:10:26.679 align:start position:0%
some um I really believe the the
 
01:10:30.189 --> 01:10:30.199 align:start position:0%
paragraph above those two is
 
01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
still a discussion of you know the
 
01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
conflicting data that the committee
 
01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:41.630 align:start position:0%
conflicting data that the committee
or

01:10:41.630 --> 01:10:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:46.270 --> 01:10:46.280 align:start position:0%
um not all conflicting data but just
 
01:10:49.310 --> 01:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
um uh concerns expressed particularly as
 
01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
I remember it from citizens who
 
01:10:53.630 --> 01:10:53.640 align:start position:0%
experienced adverse reactions from the
 
01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
vaccines and that sort of thing so I
 
01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
think um
 
01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
that's what that paragraph speaks to and
 
01:11:03.630 --> 01:11:03.640 align:start position:0%
then and then as as indicated the
 
01:11:05.630 --> 01:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
committee recommends those two
 
01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
paragraphs below that uh provide you
 
01:11:10.590 --> 01:11:10.600 align:start position:0%
know sort of the findings and
 
01:11:21.070 --> 01:11:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:23.390 --> 01:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
committee it's just not exactly a
 
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
finding but whatever I mean like on nine
 
01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
we say it's the finding of the committee
 
01:11:31.430 --> 01:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
that blah blah blah on seven I think we
 
01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:34.400 align:start position:0%
were six we had a finding for the first
 
01:11:36.350 --> 01:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
goal so I just thought maybe calling it
 
01:11:38.430 --> 01:11:38.440 align:start position:0%
out a little bit more specifically and
 
01:11:41.550 --> 01:11:41.560 align:start position:0%
building the recommendation from there I
 
01:11:44.149 --> 01:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
I should say I don't I'm not imp I don't
 
01:11:46.950 --> 01:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
want to imply that I necessarily agree
 
01:11:49.990 --> 01:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
with this assessment it's just my
 
01:11:54.229 --> 01:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:58.229 --> 01:11:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:02.030 --> 01:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:04.669 --> 01:12:04.679 align:start position:0%
beler yes uh thank you I just wanted to
 
01:12:05.950 --> 01:12:05.960 align:start position:0%
clarify because I know at least some of
 
01:12:09.950 --> 01:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
this is sort of my original language so
 
01:12:12.709 --> 01:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
when we're discussing findings
 
01:12:16.229 --> 01:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
um and perhaps to my my fault I
 
01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have used the word finding
 
01:12:20.390 --> 01:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
once or twice in the context that I did
 
01:12:22.110 --> 01:12:22.120 align:start position:0%
because it implies that that was perhaps
 
01:12:24.189 --> 01:12:24.199 align:start position:0%
our only finding where in reality
 
01:12:26.070 --> 01:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
everything after
 
01:12:29.629 --> 01:12:29.639 align:start position:0%
the paragraph um that says lastly you
 
01:12:32.189 --> 01:12:32.199 align:start position:0%
know this is was was the goal everything
 
01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
after that constitutes a a finding um
 
01:12:40.430 --> 01:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
with the sort of highlighted finding
 
01:12:44.070 --> 01:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
being a something that was sort of an
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
overriding finding of the committee
 
01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:56.910 --> 01:12:56.920 align:start position:0%
recommendations okay
 
01:12:59.709 --> 01:12:59.719 align:start position:0%
so this is going to be a long process I
 
01:13:02.790 --> 01:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
know some of us uh would like to hear
 
01:13:06.590 --> 01:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
more about what it is I know there's uh
 
01:13:10.669 --> 01:13:10.679 align:start position:0%
going to be need more discussions um
 
01:13:11.950 --> 01:13:11.960 align:start position:0%
about this
 
01:13:16.270 --> 01:13:16.280 align:start position:0%
reports um and that we will need another
 
01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:17.300 align:start position:0%
reports um and that we will need another
meeting

01:13:17.300 --> 01:13:17.310 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:18.550 align:start position:0%
meeting
[Music]

01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:13:22.950 --> 01:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
um so I guess um I'd like to ask
 
01:13:25.629 --> 01:13:25.639 align:start position:0%
representative eel um
 
01:13:28.950 --> 01:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
you know once this report has now been
 
01:13:32.430 --> 01:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
sent to the entire committee um so
 
01:13:34.590 --> 01:13:34.600 align:start position:0%
everyone on the committee now has this
 
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
in their in their email
 
01:13:42.310 --> 01:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
um what kind of time do do you need
 
01:13:50.070 --> 01:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
to to look at it um go over it um Etc um
 
01:13:52.830 --> 01:13:52.840 align:start position:0%
and we'd like to hear what your
 
01:13:55.189 --> 01:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
suggestions are
 
01:13:58.669 --> 01:13:58.679 align:start position:0%
thanks um well I guess my first question
 
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
uh in this
 
01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
revision representative weary did you
 
01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
actually change any of the conclusions
 
01:14:11.709 --> 01:14:11.719 align:start position:0%
is there anything really different in
 
01:14:16.030 --> 01:14:16.040 align:start position:0%
here other than revising and amplifying
 
01:14:20.350 --> 01:14:20.360 align:start position:0%
and the change the original document no
 
01:14:23.229 --> 01:14:23.239 align:start position:0%
I I I really didn't I think the uh I
 
01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
would say with with one possible
 
01:14:29.070 --> 01:14:29.080 align:start position:0%
exception as I brought out the impact uh
 
01:14:31.189 --> 01:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
during the discussion of the impact on
 
01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
the educational system I brought out the
 
01:14:37.910 --> 01:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
impact on um early childhood development
 
01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:39.110 align:start position:0%
impact on um early childhood development
and

01:14:39.110 --> 01:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
socialization that uh mass and school
 
01:14:45.590 --> 01:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
closures had on children we heard that
 
01:14:50.790 --> 01:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
um a few times and both from experts and
 
01:14:52.629 --> 01:14:52.639 align:start position:0%
concerned citizens and our own
 
01:14:55.149 --> 01:14:55.159 align:start position:0%
representative leus who has a lot of
 
01:14:57.910 --> 01:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
experience in that area and so I think
 
01:15:03.950 --> 01:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
from um that aspect um I I uh it may
 
01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
have been me mentioned briefly
 
01:15:10.270 --> 01:15:10.280 align:start position:0%
um but I I brought that out in
 
01:15:13.709 --> 01:15:13.719 align:start position:0%
particular as I said I I think I changed
 
01:15:15.870 --> 01:15:15.880 align:start position:0%
really the second point
 
01:15:18.790 --> 01:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
from um an emphasis on slow the spread
 
01:15:21.629 --> 01:15:21.639 align:start position:0%
to really teasing out more the aspects
 
01:15:23.790 --> 01:15:23.800 align:start position:0%
of preventing the Health Care system
 
01:15:25.790 --> 01:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
from being overwhelmed
 
01:15:29.910 --> 01:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
and um and then the rest you know and as
 
01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
I said uh perhaps earlier I did try to
 
01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
explain some of the technical aspects of
 
01:15:39.590 --> 01:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh the Swiss Cheese model the r not um
 
01:15:42.590 --> 01:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
value and
 
01:15:44.910 --> 01:15:44.920 align:start position:0%
um I think there I think there was one
 
01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
other thing but I don't I don't really
 
01:15:51.149 --> 01:15:51.159 align:start position:0%
remember it offand um so but to to
 
01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
really kind of fundamentally answer your
 
01:15:56.310 --> 01:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
question no I did not change the
 
01:15:58.990 --> 01:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
conclusions or the you know the findings
 
01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
or the conclusions of the
 
01:16:04.669 --> 01:16:04.679 align:start position:0%
report uh it's a lot of this was
 
01:16:08.669 --> 01:16:08.679 align:start position:0%
really I I think stylistic and uh just
 
01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
you know for readability and then to
 
01:16:16.990 --> 01:16:17.000 align:start position:0%
also to um you know part of readability
 
01:16:18.750 --> 01:16:18.760 align:start position:0%
meaning explaining some of the technical
 
01:16:20.790 --> 01:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
Concepts as we came across them in the
 
01:16:26.629 --> 01:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh I I think in in some cases you know
 
01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
just um maybe rearranging some thoughts
 
01:16:37.669 --> 01:16:37.679 align:start position:0%
to uh for the purposes of conciseness I
 
01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
think but um you know so there was a lot
 
01:16:45.430 --> 01:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
of stylistic editing but not quite
 
01:16:50.030 --> 01:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
frankly very much content-wise okay
 
01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
um so to answer your question I I don't
 
01:16:56.149 --> 01:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
quite know how to move ahead on it I
 
01:17:00.110 --> 01:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
think that if the content really is not
 
01:17:02.350 --> 01:17:02.360 align:start position:0%
changed and the findings and the
 
01:17:05.390 --> 01:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
conclusions are not really changed I
 
01:17:08.750 --> 01:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
don't think the position of our members
 
01:17:13.030 --> 01:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
will change um
 
01:17:19.310 --> 01:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
so the alternative would be for us to
 
01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
provide um a statement to that effect
 
01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
that could be included in the
 
01:17:29.430 --> 01:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
report I mean and whether that requires
 
01:17:32.470 --> 01:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
a whole other meeting or if we meet and
 
01:17:35.070 --> 01:17:35.080 align:start position:0%
then I just bring that in I mean or if I
 
01:17:38.510 --> 01:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
email it to you I mean I think that's
 
01:17:41.870 --> 01:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
basically that's basically where we
 
01:17:45.510 --> 01:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
stand okay represent beler thank you
 
01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
madam chair and I would it be possible
 
01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
just call a brief five minute caucus on
 
01:17:51.390 --> 01:17:51.400 align:start position:0%
on the topic just to make sure we're all
 
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
on the same page I'll go caucus with
 
01:17:58.510 --> 01:17:58.520 align:start position:0%
myself sorry representative evil but uh
 
01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:00.070 align:start position:0%
myself sorry representative evil but uh
we

01:18:00.070 --> 01:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:01.629 align:start position:0%
we
uh

01:18:01.629 --> 01:18:01.639 align:start position:0%
uh

01:27:46.270 --> 01:27:46.280 align:start position:0%
I we we are in busy busy times
 
01:27:50.550 --> 01:27:50.560 align:start position:0%
um but uh Wednesday uh November
 
01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:52.550 align:start position:0%
um but uh Wednesday uh November
13th

01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
13th
 
01:27:55.229 --> 01:27:55.239 align:start position:0%
um I have some things scheduled in the
 
01:27:57.149 --> 01:27:57.159 align:start position:0%
afternoon but I could be here at 9 in
 
01:27:58.750 --> 01:27:58.760 align:start position:0%
the morning I know that's early for some
 
01:28:01.750 --> 01:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
of us um but I didn't know if that was
 
01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:02.390 align:start position:0%
of us um but I didn't know if that was
uh

01:28:02.390 --> 01:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:28:05.350 --> 01:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
doable um because I have some traveling
 
01:28:08.109 --> 01:28:08.119 align:start position:0%
and some other things going on that week
 
01:28:13.270 --> 01:28:13.280 align:start position:0%
um that I have to take care of um so uh
 
01:28:15.750 --> 01:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
I just want to throw that out there uh
 
01:28:17.790 --> 01:28:17.800 align:start position:0%
so I believe that is the
 
01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
13th at 9:00 a.m. and I just want to
 
01:28:23.629 --> 01:28:23.639 align:start position:0%
throw that out and see what everyone
 
01:28:25.590 --> 01:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
thinks about about
 
01:28:28.629 --> 01:28:28.639 align:start position:0%
that represent Bel thank you madam chair
 
01:28:30.229 --> 01:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
I think that would be uh I think that
 
01:28:32.550 --> 01:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
would be acceptable and good I wanted to
 
01:28:34.390 --> 01:28:34.400 align:start position:0%
ask would we like to
 
01:28:37.990 --> 01:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
extend um as was requested the
 
01:28:41.470 --> 01:28:41.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to draft a a statement that
 
01:28:43.390 --> 01:28:43.400 align:start position:0%
we could receive preferably before that
 
01:28:45.590 --> 01:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
and then also discuss that day from the
 
01:28:49.030 --> 01:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:53.270 --> 01:28:53.280 align:start position:0%

01:29:02.270 --> 01:29:02.280 align:start position:0%

01:29:13.590 --> 01:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
to tell you the truth other people may
 
01:29:15.390 --> 01:29:15.400 align:start position:0%
be able to come I'm thinking about this
 
01:29:17.189 --> 01:29:17.199 align:start position:0%
other people may be able to come or
 
01:29:20.030 --> 01:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
alternatively if they can't we would um
 
01:29:22.350 --> 01:29:22.360 align:start position:0%
provide you either with a statement or
 
01:29:28.470 --> 01:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
something uh for that that day okay um
 
01:29:31.390 --> 01:29:31.400 align:start position:0%

we will have put together what I will
 
01:29:50.590 --> 01:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
assume will be a relatively brief
 
01:29:53.149 --> 01:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
statement and then you can just you know
 
01:29:54.629 --> 01:29:54.639 align:start position:0%

comment thank you madam chair um I was
 
01:30:21.750 --> 01:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
just going to recommend perhaps that if
 
01:30:24.149 --> 01:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
uh representative eil is available at
 
01:30:26.070 --> 01:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
10:30 that morning if we wanted to plan
 
01:30:30.590 --> 01:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
to convene at 9: having a statement and
 
01:30:32.470 --> 01:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
our our report which by the way because
 
01:30:33.790 --> 01:30:33.800 align:start position:0%
there are a few minor changes in
 
01:30:36.510 --> 01:30:36.520 align:start position:0%
representative wary has expressed that
 
01:30:38.870 --> 01:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
he is um very busy given us some
 
01:30:41.270 --> 01:30:41.280 align:start position:0%
personal circumstances what I can do is
 
01:30:43.030 --> 01:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
I can just go make the few modifications
 
01:30:44.709 --> 01:30:44.719 align:start position:0%
to the edited version to make sure that
 
01:30:46.030 --> 01:30:46.040 align:start position:0%
there aren't like you know sentence
 
01:30:48.189 --> 01:30:48.199 align:start position:0%
fragments um and have that also
 
01:30:49.870 --> 01:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
available prior to going in that way we
 
01:30:51.229 --> 01:30:51.239 align:start position:0%
can discuss it for a little bit knowing
 
01:30:53.149 --> 01:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
that uh representative Evel will be able
 
01:30:56.870 --> 01:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
to be here approximately 10 30 years
 
01:31:01.550 --> 01:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
panel and well it's the NR you know the
 
01:31:05.189 --> 01:31:05.199 align:start position:0%
the the I don't know it's a trash thing
 
01:31:07.669 --> 01:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
I'm on up so I'm in I'm gonna be in
 
01:31:11.189 --> 01:31:11.199 align:start position:0%
Epsom and it rounds up it it ends up at
 
01:31:14.470 --> 01:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
11: and it's an in-person thing so I
 
01:31:16.709 --> 01:31:16.719 align:start position:0%
can't I think it's going to be hard I
 
01:31:18.709 --> 01:31:18.719 align:start position:0%
appreciate that but I think I can't get
 
01:31:20.550 --> 01:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
here in the morning yeah she she won't
 
01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
be able to be here uh cuz she's going to
 
01:31:24.790 --> 01:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
be in my neck of the woods yeah
 
01:31:26.629 --> 01:31:26.639 align:start position:0%
I'm G to be over in Epsom so it' be
 
01:31:28.430 --> 01:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
really hard I mean if I was in conquer
 
01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:30.400 align:start position:0%
or if it was a zoom or something i' do
 
01:31:38.229 --> 01:31:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:40.590 --> 01:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
so thank you madam chair well in that
 
01:31:42.750 --> 01:31:42.760 align:start position:0%
case perhaps I could recommend that um
 
01:31:44.750 --> 01:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
we just make sure we have at least at
 
01:31:46.950 --> 01:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
least one Democratic member here if
 
01:31:49.070 --> 01:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
either one of them who's here or if you
 
01:31:51.070 --> 01:31:51.080 align:start position:0%
want to name somebody to introduce the
 
01:31:52.709 --> 01:31:52.719 align:start position:0%
at least to introduce the the the
 
01:31:54.550 --> 01:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
statement and that way we can discuss it
 
01:31:56.709 --> 01:31:56.719 align:start position:0%
and move forward and you know it'll be
 
01:32:00.229 --> 01:32:00.239 align:start position:0%
our statement so whatever it says it it
 
01:32:04.550 --> 01:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
it says um and so did you say there's
 
01:32:05.990 --> 01:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
going to be a few more tweaks to
 
01:32:08.669 --> 01:32:08.679 align:start position:0%
representive we's draft so then you'll
 
01:32:10.870 --> 01:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
redistribute it yes and I I'll do that
 
01:32:13.229 --> 01:32:13.239 align:start position:0%
and it's it's not going to be serious
 
01:32:14.870 --> 01:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
you know content changes or anything
 
01:32:16.030 --> 01:32:16.040 align:start position:0%
there's just a few little little
 
01:32:18.629 --> 01:32:18.639 align:start position:0%
sentence fragments or something like a
 
01:32:20.310 --> 01:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
paragraph that ended on
 
01:32:23.109 --> 01:32:23.119 align:start position:0%
a I also believe that representative wry
 
01:32:25.229 --> 01:32:25.239 align:start position:0%
right now he's uh going through a tough
 
01:32:28.950 --> 01:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh personal time time right now uh we'll
 
01:32:32.750 --> 01:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
have time maybe later next week uh to go
 
01:32:36.189 --> 01:32:36.199 align:start position:0%
over some things too um and so I'd like
 
01:32:39.189 --> 01:32:39.199 align:start position:0%
to out of respect for him um I would
 
01:32:41.350 --> 01:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
like to give him some time to do that
 
01:32:43.750 --> 01:32:43.760 align:start position:0%

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.510 align:start position:0%
yeah
um

01:32:50.510 --> 01:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:54.669 --> 01:32:54.679 align:start position:0%
um uh my my father passed away this past
 
01:33:00.430 --> 01:33:00.440 align:start position:0%
Thursday a week or a week ago and um and
 
01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:02.149 align:start position:0%
Thursday a week or a week ago and um and
um

01:33:02.149 --> 01:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:05.629 --> 01:33:05.639 align:start position:0%
uh I think uh after after this next week
 
01:33:07.629 --> 01:33:07.639 align:start position:0%
I think I'll be able to um address
 
01:33:10.070 --> 01:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
things and and perhaps uh represent
 
01:33:14.189 --> 01:33:14.199 align:start position:0%
belter and I can uh meet and you know uh
 
01:33:17.790 --> 01:33:17.800 align:start position:0%
and iron out the uh any wording word
 
01:33:20.189 --> 01:33:20.199 align:start position:0%
smithing or things that need to be
 
01:33:22.750 --> 01:33:22.760 align:start position:0%
clarified thank you appreciate that yeah
 
01:33:25.510 --> 01:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry about the my my mother died
 
01:33:27.950 --> 01:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
two years ago at exactly this time and
 
01:33:31.229 --> 01:33:31.239 align:start position:0%
it's still a tough could I suggest when
 
01:33:32.990 --> 01:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
you guys do if you could do some
 
01:33:35.709 --> 01:33:35.719 align:start position:0%
appendices that sort of outlined
 
01:33:38.270 --> 01:33:38.280 align:start position:0%
specifically who your Witnesses are and
 
01:33:41.070 --> 01:33:41.080 align:start position:0%
maybe just a list of your key documents
 
01:33:42.790 --> 01:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
I mean the way this is going to work out
 
01:33:44.550 --> 01:33:44.560 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a document that lives
 
01:33:47.149 --> 01:33:47.159 align:start position:0%
online under our committee so you could
 
01:33:50.149 --> 01:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
do some hyperlinks in it to some of the
 
01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
key not everything but some of the stuff
 
01:33:55.550 --> 01:33:55.560 align:start position:0%
that you found particularly persuasive
 
01:33:59.390 --> 01:33:59.400 align:start position:0%
in in developing your your
 
01:34:03.590 --> 01:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
findings I if we uh if for example we
 
01:34:07.830 --> 01:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
had a a link to a particular testimony
 
01:34:12.590 --> 01:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
and then had underneath that um some of
 
01:34:14.790 --> 01:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
the major topics that that witness
 
01:34:18.669 --> 01:34:18.679 align:start position:0%
testified to um so rather than trying to
 
01:34:20.709 --> 01:34:20.719 align:start position:0%
provide links throughout the report to
 
01:34:23.310 --> 01:34:23.320 align:start position:0%
to Mr representative belker's earlier
 
01:34:26.310 --> 01:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
statement I think that might be useful I
 
01:34:28.350 --> 01:34:28.360 align:start position:0%
mean honestly I think it would also give
 
01:34:32.790 --> 01:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
more oomph to your to your document um
 
01:34:35.990 --> 01:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
and anyway so just so you know if you go
 
01:34:38.310 --> 01:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
on to our website and you see our
 
01:34:40.629 --> 01:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
standing committee then it says at at
 
01:34:42.910 --> 01:34:42.920 align:start position:0%
the bottom it says committee links and
 
01:34:45.669 --> 01:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
we do have on here like the after action
 
01:34:48.590 --> 01:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
report is already there
 
01:34:51.510 --> 01:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
um I believe
 
01:34:55.189 --> 01:34:55.199 align:start position:0%
um uh representative Alicia comments her
 
01:34:58.109 --> 01:34:58.119 align:start position:0%
testimony is is there uh her written
 
01:35:00.229 --> 01:35:00.239 align:start position:0%
statement uh and we have a few other
 
01:35:01.910 --> 01:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
documents if anyone thinks of any other
 
01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
documents that needs to be uploaded onto
 
01:35:08.229 --> 01:35:08.239 align:start position:0%
this um let me know and we can ask um
 
01:35:10.709 --> 01:35:10.719 align:start position:0%
Jamie to do that for us please represent
 
01:35:14.390 --> 01:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
Belair represent poov had something
 
01:35:18.350 --> 01:35:18.360 align:start position:0%
first I just want to agree with what
 
01:35:22.750 --> 01:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
representative AEL said and I I I
 
01:35:25.229 --> 01:35:25.239 align:start position:0%
understand that 12 days it seems a lot
 
01:35:27.550 --> 01:35:27.560 align:start position:0%
and maybe we won't have enough time to
 
01:35:31.790 --> 01:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
put every uh every link but as much
 
01:35:34.629 --> 01:35:34.639 align:start position:0%
documentation as we can provide in the
 
01:35:37.430 --> 01:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
report it will be really helpful for
 
01:35:41.189 --> 01:35:41.199 align:start position:0%
those who will be dealing with it in
 
01:35:43.629 --> 01:35:43.639 align:start position:0%
future represent Belair thank you madam
 
01:35:45.870 --> 01:35:45.880 align:start position:0%
chair and uh just on that topic of
 
01:35:48.149 --> 01:35:48.159 align:start position:0%
what's currently on the website um and
 
01:35:51.470 --> 01:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
what needs to be there uh and references
 
01:35:54.790 --> 01:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
in the report uh I think we can do some
 
01:35:57.629 --> 01:35:57.639 align:start position:0%
work to to make some references that are
 
01:36:01.070 --> 01:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate where possible um the
 
01:36:04.229 --> 01:36:04.239 align:start position:0%
references may be extraordinarily broad
 
01:36:07.189 --> 01:36:07.199 align:start position:0%
given how much I myself have
 
01:36:09.390 --> 01:36:09.400 align:start position:0%
introduced probably several dozen or
 
01:36:11.870 --> 01:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
more documents not not including the
 
01:36:14.109 --> 01:36:14.119 align:start position:0%
totality of executive and emergency
 
01:36:15.750 --> 01:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
orders that were issued during the
 
01:36:19.070 --> 01:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
pandemic um so if if the if the request
 
01:36:21.629 --> 01:36:21.639 align:start position:0%
is to have some hyperlinks that will
 
01:36:24.790 --> 01:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
reference what is already in the report
 
01:36:28.310 --> 01:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
um to substantiate findings and claims
 
01:36:30.870 --> 01:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
we're if possible going to need the
 
01:36:32.629 --> 01:36:32.639 align:start position:0%
entirety of documents that have been
 
01:36:34.430 --> 01:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
introduced into the committee through
 
01:36:37.109 --> 01:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
these previous emails to be uploaded um
 
01:36:39.790 --> 01:36:39.800 align:start position:0%
and hyperlink on under our Committee
 
01:36:42.030 --> 01:36:42.040 align:start position:0%
website I mean I think you can just feel
 
01:36:44.629 --> 01:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
your way along I mean even like for Dr
 
01:36:46.510 --> 01:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
Jordan vaugh you could put his name and
 
01:36:48.470 --> 01:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
you could put a link to his website or
 
01:36:50.229 --> 01:36:50.239 align:start position:0%
something I mean just some things like
 
01:36:52.550 --> 01:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
that I do think on the executive orders
 
01:36:54.510 --> 01:36:54.520 align:start position:0%
I agree with you that really important
 
01:36:57.229 --> 01:36:57.239 align:start position:0%
we should have um something on that I
 
01:36:59.350 --> 01:36:59.360 align:start position:0%
would bet that there may be a place
 
01:37:01.669 --> 01:37:01.679 align:start position:0%
living on the governor's website that
 
01:37:03.709 --> 01:37:03.719 align:start position:0%
you can find those executive orders and
 
01:37:05.990 --> 01:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
to some extent you know the committee
 
01:37:09.109 --> 01:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
researcher may be able to help you uh
 
01:37:11.629 --> 01:37:11.639 align:start position:0%
with this I also want to make sure
 
01:37:14.229 --> 01:37:14.239 align:start position:0%
stating the obvious that the link for
 
01:37:14.239 --> 01:37:15.470 align:start position:0%
stating the obvious that the link for
the

01:37:15.470 --> 01:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:37:18.750 --> 01:37:18.760 align:start position:0%
committee is in the document if you know
 
01:37:21.390 --> 01:37:21.400 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying I don't see it right now
 
01:37:23.189 --> 01:37:23.199 align:start position:0%
but we want to give a link to where all
 
01:37:25.510 --> 01:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
our our stuff
 
01:37:28.470 --> 01:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
is but I do think it's important that we
 
01:37:32.510 --> 01:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
have an appendix that lists the the uh
 
01:37:34.629 --> 01:37:34.639 align:start position:0%
Witnesses and you can give a link to
 
01:37:37.109 --> 01:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
their organization if you want and and
 
01:37:39.149 --> 01:37:39.159 align:start position:0%
on I I mean I would think the researcher
 
01:37:42.990 --> 01:37:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:45.709 --> 01:37:45.719 align:start position:0%
too I think that's a very good idea so
 
01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:56.270 --> 01:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
anybody else have anything they'd like
 
01:37:58.390 --> 01:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
to discuss I think uh does everyone
 
01:37:59.430 --> 01:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
agree on an
 
01:38:01.830 --> 01:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
appendix uh making sure we get
 
01:38:04.510 --> 01:38:04.520 align:start position:0%
everything up on the uh into our
 
01:38:10.070 --> 01:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
website uh Etc and I will reach out to
 
01:38:13.550 --> 01:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
uh our researcher um and ask her to you
 
01:38:15.589 --> 01:38:15.599 align:start position:0%
know link some of the things and maybe
 
01:38:18.990 --> 01:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
she can link like even uh the Homeland
 
01:38:22.430 --> 01:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
uh security uh Homeland Security report
 
01:38:25.430 --> 01:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
um and and uh I think the co timeline
 
01:38:27.390 --> 01:38:27.400 align:start position:0%
report is especially important to be up
 
01:38:30.109 --> 01:38:30.119 align:start position:0%
there uh right so that after action
 
01:38:33.270 --> 01:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
report right so um those those items I
 
01:38:34.790 --> 01:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
think would be important to have on our
 
01:38:37.270 --> 01:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
on our website also we'll live in two
 
01:38:39.990 --> 01:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
places but redundancy is not a bad thing
 
01:38:41.430 --> 01:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes because sometimes people are
 
01:38:43.070 --> 01:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
just going to be looking at our the
 
01:38:45.830 --> 01:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
report so the only other thing and maybe
 
01:38:48.189 --> 01:38:48.199 align:start position:0%
I missed it part of our charge was the
 
01:38:50.830 --> 01:38:50.840 align:start position:0%
issue of uh dissemination of federal
 
01:38:53.510 --> 01:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
funds that's what uh commissioner
 
01:38:57.149 --> 01:38:57.159 align:start position:0%
Caswell had talked about is that in here
 
01:38:57.159 --> 01:38:58.149 align:start position:0%
Caswell had talked about is that in here
in

01:38:58.149 --> 01:38:58.159 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:38:58.159 --> 01:39:02.870 align:start position:0%
in
some

01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:06.109 --> 01:39:06.119 align:start position:0%
way if I if I may uh on that
 
01:39:08.430 --> 01:39:08.440 align:start position:0%
one uh when I was writing it I didn't do
 
01:39:10.709 --> 01:39:10.719 align:start position:0%
a deep dive into it frankly just because
 
01:39:12.229 --> 01:39:12.239 align:start position:0%
the executive has already done and
 
01:39:14.270 --> 01:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
provided a deep dive into it so I think
 
01:39:17.430 --> 01:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
if we wanted to Simply reference their
 
01:39:20.070 --> 01:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
work which is is quite extensive on that
 
01:39:21.470 --> 01:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
I think we don't need to duplicate that
 
01:39:23.910 --> 01:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
effort yeah I mean I think it just just
 
01:39:25.629 --> 01:39:25.639 align:start position:0%
because it was part of our charge I
 
01:39:28.149 --> 01:39:28.159 align:start position:0%
think if you reference that that in some
 
01:39:35.430 --> 01:39:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:38.950 --> 01:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
helpful anything else I mean this is all
 
01:39:41.790 --> 01:39:41.800 align:start position:0%
good stuff so uh you know we want to
 
01:39:43.950 --> 01:39:43.960 align:start position:0%
make sure that all the information is
 
01:39:46.589 --> 01:39:46.599 align:start position:0%
available to everyone that we heard and
 
01:39:49.430 --> 01:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
saw so
 
01:39:53.430 --> 01:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
um okay
 
01:39:56.109 --> 01:39:56.119 align:start position:0%
so I guess uh what did I say
 
01:40:04.510 --> 01:40:04.520 align:start position:0%
November 13th at 9:00 a.m. um okay great
 
01:40:06.870 --> 01:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
so is the idea that the final blessing
 
01:40:08.870 --> 01:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
of the report will be on that day and
 
01:40:11.430 --> 01:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
we'll bring our happy crew to a
 
01:40:13.750 --> 01:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
conclusion yes
 
01:40:17.189 --> 01:40:17.199 align:start position:0%
please I don't know about no the 13th I
 
01:40:18.910 --> 01:40:18.920 align:start position:0%
don't know it's a Wednesday though okay
 
01:40:20.990 --> 01:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
okay Friday not a Friday I'm glad
 
01:40:23.990 --> 01:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
somebody's as superstitious as I am
 
01:40:28.149 --> 01:40:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:30.830 --> 01:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately um all right well thank
 
01:40:33.510 --> 01:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
you everyone I appreciate it everyone uh
 
01:40:37.070 --> 01:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
have a great weekend um I don't know if
