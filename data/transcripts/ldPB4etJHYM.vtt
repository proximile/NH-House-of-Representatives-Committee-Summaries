be acted on
 
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:43.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
on the calendar of the eight bills we
 
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
we have four bills on the consent
 
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.029 align:start position:0%
we have four bills on the consent
calendar

00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:55.039 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
00:06:59.350 --> 00:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
that's hospital 533 565
 
00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:03.199 align:start position:0%
610 and 615. so that leaves four bills
 
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
on the regular calendar that
 
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
those four bills enlisted the
 
00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:11.759 align:start position:0%
bills that are on consent calendar are
 
00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
pulled off
 
00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
but you can expect that the four
 
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
bills on the regular calendar will be
 
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.110 align:start position:0%
bills on the regular calendar will be
debated

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:32.919 align:start position:0%
house bill 15 and house bill
 
00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:37.759 align:start position:0%
626 house bill 15 is the one that has to
 
00:07:37.759 --> 00:07:38.070 align:start position:0%
626 house bill 15 is the one that has to
do

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
with the facilitators
 
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
and house bill 626 has to do
 
00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.469 align:start position:0%
 
machines

00:07:58.469 --> 00:07:58.479 align:start position:0%
machines
 
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
now before we started representative
 
00:08:05.589 --> 00:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
elliot had started a discussion on house
 
00:08:07.749 --> 00:08:07.759 align:start position:0%
bill 626
 
00:08:11.029 --> 00:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
and we can continue that discussion
 
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
representative romney you want to
 
00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
respond to what
 
00:08:18.869 --> 00:08:18.879 align:start position:0%
representative elliot questioned those
 
00:08:21.589 --> 00:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
i have the highest regard for uh
 
00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
representative kirk
 
00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:24.639 align:start position:0%
but you gotta understand about
 
00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
representative kirk he's never
 
00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:29.599 align:start position:0%
he's never supported any any gaming of
 
00:08:31.029 --> 00:08:31.039 align:start position:0%
any kind
 
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
over the years uh it's interesting that
 
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
he's defending the honor of of
 
00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
establishments to
 
00:08:42.149 --> 00:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
put these braces in even though he's
 
00:08:43.029 --> 00:08:43.039 align:start position:0%
really against
 
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
the whole idea so
 
00:08:48.389 --> 00:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
when this bill came out a couple years
 
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
ago wasn't originally my bill
 
00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:59.430 --> 00:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
churchill downs who owns
 
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:04.240 align:start position:0%
who owns oxford casino threatened
 
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
to open a whole bunch of these terrible
 
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.790 align:start position:0%
to open a whole bunch of these terrible
locations

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
locations
 
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
with just these machines in them as a
 
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
way of preventing that
 
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
we put a a kind of a freeze period of
 
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
so that that wouldn't happen so that you
 
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
had to be
 
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
a ongoing concern uh we didn't want to
 
00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:27.509 align:start position:0%
a ongoing concern uh we didn't want to
open

00:09:27.509 --> 00:09:27.519 align:start position:0%
open
 
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
with charitable with the historic racing
 
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
machines and having new establishments
 
00:09:32.949 --> 00:09:32.959 align:start position:0%
open with these machines
 
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
in them uh just for the purpose of of
 
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:36.710 align:start position:0%
in them uh just for the purpose of of
that

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:09:39.269 --> 00:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
of having those machines so that's why
 
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
it was originally in there but
 
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
when you when you look at it now it also
 
00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.269 align:start position:0%
when you when you look at it now it also
gives

00:09:45.269 --> 00:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
gives
 
00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
communities having to do with the opt-in
 
00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:48.710 align:start position:0%
communities having to do with the opt-in
stuff

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
without historic without charitable
 
00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:57.750 align:start position:0%
without historic without charitable
gaming

00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
gaming
 
00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
to look at but they want to zone
 
00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
the way they want a zone if they don't
 
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
want a charitable uh
 
00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:08.720 align:start position:0%
location in their town um that that'll
 
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
give them some time to do that
 
00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
what can i say that's kind of the
 
00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
history of it uh
 
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
and during this period during this
 
00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
initial period
 
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
anybody who wants to open a charitable
 
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.829 align:start position:0%
anybody who wants to open a charitable
location

00:10:25.829 --> 00:10:25.839 align:start position:0%
location
 
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
can do so it isn't saying to anyone that
 
00:10:29.269 --> 00:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
they cannot
 
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
not open their 16 locations currently
 
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
uh it's open to anyone who wants to open
 
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
a business
 
00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
we're not stop we're not stopping them
 
00:10:40.069 --> 00:10:40.079 align:start position:0%
to to do that
 
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
but we're just putting uh but if you're
 
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
a new location
 
00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
where we're putting a a pause of three
 
00:10:46.079 --> 00:10:47.430 align:start position:0%
where we're putting a a pause of three
years

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they are indeed
 
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
a reliable a terrible location
 
00:10:58.389 --> 00:10:58.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
without without these machines and then
 
00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
once they prove themselves
 
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:05.200 align:start position:0%
then then they um can go forward
 
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
and and bring these machines in that's
 
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
basically the logic
 
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
and this was in the bill we discussed
 
00:11:12.829 --> 00:11:12.839 align:start position:0%
this in committee uh there's nothing new
 
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
here um
 
00:11:18.069 --> 00:11:18.079 align:start position:0%
the and the hypocrisy of it all
 
00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
is that neil kirk my friend
 
00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
has a website out there that
 
00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
um is you know fighting against this
 
00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
but i have found out that that website
 
00:11:33.509 --> 00:11:33.519 align:start position:0%
is paid for by churchill downs
 
00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
um and churchill downs is opening
 
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
they're renovating a facility in
 
00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:42.399 align:start position:0%
kentucky right now that they own uh
 
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
to have live racing and to put 1500 of
 
00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.150 align:start position:0%
to have live racing and to put 1500 of
these

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
machines in in that and the reason being
 
00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:50.150 align:start position:0%
machines in in that and the reason being
because

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
the horse racing people know that horse
 
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
racing is too slow for the young crowd
 
00:11:58.949 --> 00:11:58.959 align:start position:0%
this is half an hour between races
 
00:12:02.949 --> 00:12:02.959 align:start position:0%
is is just too boring so
 
00:12:06.069 --> 00:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
um so what they're doing their strategy
 
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
is to use these same exact machines
 
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
that they're paying to fight against
 
00:12:12.949 --> 00:12:12.959 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:12:14.629 --> 00:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
okay and they're putting the same
 
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
machines in in kentucky
 
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
1500 machines in this facility uh so
 
00:12:21.829 --> 00:12:21.839 align:start position:0%
i mean this is what this is what we've
 
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
been fighting here in this bill all
 
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
sorts of misinformation
 
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
um and that's all i can say it's getting
 
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
a little frustrating actually
 
00:12:34.389 --> 00:12:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and i do not know
 
00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
if churchill downs is paying for
 
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
representative kirk's website
 
00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
it would be nice if you're going to make
 
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
accusations like that to have
 
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
evidence i have been the subject of
 
00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
accusations for years now that were
 
00:12:54.069 --> 00:12:54.079 align:start position:0%
spoken out loud
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
that on that the coalition against
 
00:13:00.069 --> 00:13:00.079 align:start position:0%
expanded gambling which had various
 
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
names over the years
 
00:13:04.829 --> 00:13:04.839 align:start position:0%
on was getting money from places like
 
00:13:07.509 --> 00:13:07.519 align:start position:0%
casinos when we were not
 
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
are not and would not
 
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
on and it would be
 
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
um it would talking about hypocrisy
 
00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:22.720 align:start position:0%
to take away the option from the
 
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
communities that have already been
 
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
a poker place put into it
 
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
on which is now going to blossom into
 
00:13:35.829 --> 00:13:35.839 align:start position:0%
machine gambling in communities that
 
00:13:39.509 --> 00:13:39.519 align:start position:0%
did not want that who are required to
 
00:13:40.949 --> 00:13:40.959 align:start position:0%
take it
 
00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
and there are many small communities
 
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
that refuse to have zoning so they will
 
00:13:46.949 --> 00:13:46.959 align:start position:0%
be helpless against this
 
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:56.079 align:start position:0%
i i just i object thank you
 
00:13:59.509 --> 00:13:59.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:03.189 --> 00:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
thank you um you know
 
00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
the first thing i want to say is that
 
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
i'm a little troubled by having this
 
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.110 align:start position:0%
i'm a little troubled by having this
discussion

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:09.519 align:start position:0%
i don't think this was um the meeting
 
00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
was was noticed to discuss
 
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
bills that remain before us and um
 
00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
revenue issues so i don't really
 
00:14:19.189 --> 00:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
understand this
 
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
being a subject of discussion i guess i
 
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
i want to say on what is being discussed
 
00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
that um the
 
00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
if there's any implication that
 
00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.590 align:start position:0%
if there's any implication that
opposition

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
opposition
 
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
to this bill can be based on the merits
 
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
or demerits of the bill and nothing else
 
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:40.470 align:start position:0%
or demerits of the bill and nothing else
then

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
i i i reject that
 
00:14:46.629 --> 00:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
i i'm opposed to the bill because of
 
00:14:48.389 --> 00:14:48.399 align:start position:0%
what's in it
 
00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:51.839 align:start position:0%
and as everybody at least who was around
 
00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:54.160 align:start position:0%
eight years ago no i chaired a
 
00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:55.269 align:start position:0%
eight years ago no i chaired a
commission

00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
that put together a bill that proposed
 
00:15:01.829 --> 00:15:01.839 align:start position:0%
the startup of a single large
 
00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:06.959 align:start position:0%
casino and uh so you know i don't
 
00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
i i'm interested in the merits of a
 
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
proposal i think the merits of this
 
00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.870 align:start position:0%
proposal i think the merits of this
proposal

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
are lacking and that's why i've opposed
 
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
it i'm not going to go further with that
 
00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
i think we've you know i we've discussed
 
00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:20.629 align:start position:0%
i think we've you know i we've discussed
this

00:15:20.629 --> 00:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
and we'll discuss it we'll debate it on
 
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
the floor the bill's
 
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
in-house bill 2. so we'll probably have
 
00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
a debate
 
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
in that context before we even reach the
 
00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:31.350 align:start position:0%
in that context before we even reach the
bill

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
that's come through this committee
 
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
because it's the same bill
 
00:15:38.949 --> 00:15:38.959 align:start position:0%
the same text that's in house bill 2.
 
00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
so i look forward to that debate and
 
00:15:41.279 --> 00:15:42.069 align:start position:0%
so i look forward to that debate and
we'll

00:15:42.069 --> 00:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
we'll
 
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
see what happens and as far as churchill
 
00:15:45.269 --> 00:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
downs go
 
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
i have no relationship whatsoever to it
 
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
and uh object to any implication that i
 
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:59.910 --> 00:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
okay um what i'd like to
 
00:16:03.509 --> 00:16:03.519 align:start position:0%
do is later on
 
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
uh susan if we can get together
 
00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
and agree to how many
 
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
we would like to have speak on each side
 
00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:21.509 --> 00:16:21.519 align:start position:0%
this is going to be very difficult
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
because it was
 
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
put by certain people
 
00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
into hb2 and
 
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
so there will be two debates
 
00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
i do not understand why our bill isn't
 
00:16:36.639 --> 00:16:37.110 align:start position:0%
i do not understand why our bill isn't
being

00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
retained or something in this case but
 
00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
probably it's too late to do it
 
00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
um but on i have to consult with all
 
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
sorts of different people
 
00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
about this now because it's in two
 
00:16:49.519 --> 00:16:50.949 align:start position:0%
about this now because it's in two
places

00:16:50.949 --> 00:16:50.959 align:start position:0%
places
 
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
and i don't know when we're going to
 
00:16:55.189 --> 00:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
finish trying to figure things out
 
00:16:58.470 --> 00:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
thank you well thank you
 
00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:01.749 align:start position:0%
thank you well thank you
um

00:17:01.749 --> 00:17:01.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:05.029 --> 00:17:05.039 align:start position:0%
and representative ames you're right
 
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
it wasn't noticed for this discussion
 
00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
but this discussion started with mr
 
00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
when representative elliot had his
 
00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:13.909 align:start position:0%
when representative elliot had his
question

00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:16.079 align:start position:0%
and i felt since he brought up the
 
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
questions might as well
 
00:17:23.669 --> 00:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
get the answers um
 
00:17:27.029 --> 00:17:27.039 align:start position:0%
anything else new
 
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
on this part of the discussion
 
00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.830 align:start position:0%
on this part of the discussion
representative

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
abram i just want to say that in no way
 
00:17:35.029 --> 00:17:35.039 align:start position:0%
was i
 
00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
when i mentioned churchill downs was i
 
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
implying anyone on this
 
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
uh committee had anything to do with
 
00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
churchill downs
 
00:17:44.789 --> 00:17:44.799 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to say that i didn't say
 
00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:52.000 align:start position:0%

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.510 align:start position:0%

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:03.440 align:start position:0%

major
 
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
i i've heard and maybe it's official
 
00:18:31.029 --> 00:18:31.039 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
bills are going to be ordered in a
 
00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
different way than
 
00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
is customary so that uh the ought to
 
00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:38.549 align:start position:0%
is customary so that uh the ought to
pass

00:18:38.549 --> 00:18:38.559 align:start position:0%
pass
 
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
motions will uh precede the itl motions
 
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
correct that's what we heard
 
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
is they're going to concentrate
 
00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
wednesday on house bill
 
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
1 2 and 25.
 
00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
25 is the bill has to do with
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
construction etc and then
 
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
on thursday second day
 
00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:10.720 align:start position:0%
concentrate on all the ought to pass
 
00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.029 align:start position:0%
concentrate on all the ought to pass
bills

00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:13.039 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
and then friday the
 
00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
itls bills
 
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
and that's the we've been told now
 
00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
if house bill 1 2 and 25 goes
 
00:19:30.549 --> 00:19:30.559 align:start position:0%
quicker then they may start on the ought
 
00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
to pass bills
 
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
on wednesday
 
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
but he plans to start at nine and go to
 
00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
six or seven o'clock
 
00:19:43.909 --> 00:19:43.919 align:start position:0%
wednesday night the same thing start at
 
00:19:43.919 --> 00:19:44.390 align:start position:0%
wednesday night the same thing start at
nine

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:44.400 align:start position:0%

00:19:47.669 --> 00:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
on thursday and go to six
 
00:19:51.669 --> 00:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
at seven and then the same for friday
 
00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
but i'm hoping that we can finish all of
 
00:19:59.190 --> 00:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
our work in two days but it depends on
 
00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
most people have made up their mind
 
00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
if you're going to talk on a bill i
 
00:20:14.549 --> 00:20:14.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
important points no more than three
 
00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
minutes or
 
00:20:23.029 --> 00:20:23.039 align:start position:0%
because we're on for one look
 
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
everybody turns out and and let's get
 
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
this thing over with
 
00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
your points let the next ones fake make
 
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
your points
 
00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
but don't go on for 15 to 20 minutes
 
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
just keep my fingers crossed hope that
 
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
things can go smoothly
 
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
everybody can have their say those pros

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
do what she could to find some expert
 
00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
out of washington
 
00:21:58.950 --> 00:21:58.960 align:start position:0%

what they can't and can't do
 
00:22:09.909 --> 00:22:09.919 align:start position:0%

her slides about 15 slices or so
 
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.440 align:start position:0%

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.230 align:start position:0%
it'll give us an opportunity to
interface

00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:58.240 align:start position:0%

00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:01.919 align:start position:0%

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
with this relative to revenues
 
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
also nice to know about the
 
00:23:14.789 --> 00:23:14.799 align:start position:0%
appropriation part of it too
 
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:18.000 align:start position:0%

if they want to or any of their members
 
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
and so far looks like the two chairmans
 
00:23:49.269 --> 00:23:49.279 align:start position:0%
from the senate
 
00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:52.480 align:start position:0%

interesting

caucus of the republicans
 
00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
and then as of this
 
00:24:25.029 --> 00:24:25.039 align:start position:0%
point in time the final decision
 
00:24:25.039 --> 00:24:25.909 align:start position:0%

now we may not be meeting on thursday
 
00:24:51.029 --> 00:24:51.039 align:start position:0%

secretary state
 
00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
so that's the genesis of the request uh
 
00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
it was based on a request that we had
 
00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:10.710 align:start position:0%
it was based on a request that we had
received

00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
received
 
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh and happy to answer your questions or
 
00:28:14.789 --> 00:28:14.799 align:start position:0%

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
so that's the language that you show in
 
00:28:19.669 --> 00:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
your email
 
00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
which is in italicized
 
00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:26.630 align:start position:0%
which is in italicized
letters

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
an applicant who does not make the
 
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
definition of a charitable
 
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
organization and then you have a b and c
 
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
yes exactly okay does everybody have a
 
00:28:41.269 --> 00:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
no no okay
 
00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
i received it i received it yesterday
 
00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
um i have a question of uh to follow up
 
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
um and the question is well let me back
 
00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:05.269 align:start position:0%
um and the question is well let me back
up

00:29:05.269 --> 00:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
we do have a bill that we've retained
 
00:29:09.029 --> 00:29:09.039 align:start position:0%
it's a house bill
 
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
it was uh filed by representative ulery
 
00:29:16.149 --> 00:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
and it's 364 and
 
00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
it expands the definition of charitable
 
00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:21.430 align:start position:0%
it expands the definition of charitable
organization

00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
to include food fraternal organizations
 
00:29:27.669 --> 00:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
and the way it was done was to reference
 
00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
uh several irs sections for tax
 
00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:33.350 align:start position:0%
uh several irs sections for tax
exemption

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to point that out and
 
00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:37.750 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to point that out and
then

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
my question is is there an exempt status
 
00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:43.590 align:start position:0%
my question is is there an exempt status
for

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
a trust such as this that's in the
 
00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
um thank you question representative not
 
00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
that i'm aware of
 
00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:57.200 align:start position:0%
i mean for our purposes the tax code is
 
00:29:59.110 --> 00:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
really just a reference point
 
00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
um if that makes sense i don't really
 
00:30:03.669 --> 00:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
view the
 
00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
a charitable entity could it could be
 
00:30:08.389 --> 00:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
both could be exempt under irs or be a
 
00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:10.240 align:start position:0%
charitable trust or both
 
00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
um so i i don't think that's it's just
 
00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.510 align:start position:0%
um so i i don't think that's it's just
positive

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
positive
 
00:30:17.389 --> 00:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
well i'm not i'm not suggesting this is
 
00:30:22.789 --> 00:30:22.799 align:start position:0%
positively asking
 
00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
360 has to do with funding sources for
 
00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:27.350 align:start position:0%
360 has to do with funding sources for
domestic

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
domestic
 
00:30:31.269 --> 00:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
violence programs did i i said 364.
 
00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
representatives i think i've received a
 
00:30:48.149 --> 00:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
note i think it has to do with raffle
 
00:30:48.159 --> 00:30:49.750 align:start position:0%
note i think it has to do with raffle
specifically

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
and not charitable gambling in this
 
00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:53.430 align:start position:0%
and not charitable gambling in this
context

00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
context
 
00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
so it'd be raffles that you would apply
 
00:30:57.029 --> 00:30:57.039 align:start position:0%
for a city or town for
 
00:31:06.389 --> 00:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:09.269 --> 00:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
i guess uh a comment is the uh well
 
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
we're waiting for the chair
 
00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
the um i think one of the reasons that
 
00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
the ir internal revenue code is
 
00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:18.470 align:start position:0%
the ir internal revenue code is
referenced

00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
referenced
 
00:31:22.789 --> 00:31:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
it's a way of ensuring the charitable
 
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
purposes of an organization and
 
00:31:32.389 --> 00:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
if we don't have that i guess you would
 
00:31:32.399 --> 00:31:33.750 align:start position:0%
if we don't have that i guess you would
say

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
that in this situation we have the
 
00:31:44.789 --> 00:31:44.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:46.559 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office
 
00:31:46.559 --> 00:31:48.310 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office
involvement

00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
involvement
 
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
as a way of providing that but i guess
 
00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
i'd like to know more
 
00:31:56.549 --> 00:31:56.559 align:start position:0%
about what the attorney general needs to
 
00:31:56.559 --> 00:31:57.750 align:start position:0%
about what the attorney general needs to
find

00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
find
 
00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
charlie are you familiar with 364.
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
um i am not briefed on it for today
 
00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
purposes but yes
 
00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
it is titled expanding the definition of
 
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:22.870 align:start position:0%
it is titled expanding the definition of
charitable

00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
charitable
 
00:32:25.269 --> 00:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
organizations to include fraternal
 
00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:27.200 align:start position:0%
organizations for the purpose of holding
 
00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:31.190 align:start position:0%
organizations for the purpose of holding
raffles

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:36.149 --> 00:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:43.029 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:32:43.029 --> 00:32:43.039 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
and would that amends actually if you
 
00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:46.230 align:start position:0%
and would that amends actually if you
would

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
mr chairman if you let me um valerie
 
00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
king is on if you would let her in she's
 
00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
texting me notes related to statutory
 
00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:54.389 align:start position:0%
texting me notes related to statutory
interpretation

00:32:54.389 --> 00:32:54.399 align:start position:0%
interpretation
 
00:32:55.909 --> 00:32:55.919 align:start position:0%
because that amends a different statute
 
00:32:57.509 --> 00:32:57.519 align:start position:0%
it demands 287a
 
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
we mean would you like yup just promoted
 
00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:09.350 align:start position:0%
we mean would you like yup just promoted
her

00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
valerie muted hi hi um
 
00:33:15.909 --> 00:33:15.919 align:start position:0%
so the reference to the change in the
 
00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
different irs uh designations is for
 
00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
amendments to rsa287a which is the
 
00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:23.430 align:start position:0%
amendments to rsa287a which is the
raffle

00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
raffle
 
00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
statute the lottery does not regulate
 
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
the raffle statute that is regulated by
 
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
the city or town in which the
 
00:33:33.029 --> 00:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
raffle drawing takes place so that has
 
00:33:33.039 --> 00:33:33.669 align:start position:0%
raffle drawing takes place so that has
no

00:33:33.669 --> 00:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
bearing on the games of chance
 
00:33:47.909 --> 00:33:47.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:58.669 --> 00:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
rsa 287d is games of chance
 
00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:07.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
okay and senate bill 27
 
00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:21.829 --> 00:34:21.839 align:start position:0%
it deals with rsa 287 d and rsa 287
 
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
e which is games of chance bingo and
 
00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
lucky seven
 
00:34:28.629 --> 00:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
those are our charitable games raffle is
 
00:34:32.829 --> 00:34:32.839 align:start position:0%
not considered a charitable game under
 
00:34:32.839 --> 00:34:34.389 align:start position:0%
not considered a charitable game under
lottery

00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
lottery
 
00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
so what i don't have the statute in
 
00:34:37.589 --> 00:34:37.599 align:start position:0%
front of me but what what
 
00:34:39.589 --> 00:34:39.599 align:start position:0%
is the definition of a charitable
 
00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:41.839 align:start position:0%
organization under
 
00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
under 287 c that's the right one um do
 
00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
you mean 287 a the raffles
 
00:34:53.109 --> 00:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
no moving off from that raffles the
 
00:34:53.119 --> 00:34:54.310 align:start position:0%
no moving off from that raffles the
applicable

00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
applicable
 
00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
statute 287d
 
00:34:59.750 --> 00:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
which is what we're talking about right
 
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
now is a charitable organization
 
00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
means this is what it currently says
 
00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:06.640 align:start position:0%
um do you want what it currently says or
 
00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
what is planning to okay
 
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
currently says means a bonafide
 
00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:12.069 align:start position:0%
currently says means a bonafide
religious

00:35:12.069 --> 00:35:12.079 align:start position:0%

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
for at least two years um and doesn't
 
00:35:27.829 --> 00:35:27.839 align:start position:0%
and then it goes on to talk about it
 
00:35:28.829 --> 00:35:28.839 align:start position:0%
doesn't include
 
00:35:37.829 --> 00:35:37.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
so i think that is different from the
 
00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
bill we've retained so
 
00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
then bring it
 
00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:58.069 --> 00:35:58.079 align:start position:0%
would you say i don't i don't know the
 
00:35:58.079 --> 00:35:58.390 align:start position:0%
would you say i don't i don't know the
uh

00:35:58.390 --> 00:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
i don't really know charitable trust but
 
00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:01.510 align:start position:0%
i don't really know charitable trust but
uh

00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
the string of of uh
 
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
i guess i guess i'd like to understand
 
00:36:09.829 --> 00:36:09.839 align:start position:0%
why this is not included or
 
00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:31.109 --> 00:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
mary hackton phillips mr chair i
 
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
um representative ames i had similar
 
00:36:42.069 --> 00:36:42.079 align:start position:0%
questions so i did the deep dive on the
 
00:36:42.079 --> 00:36:42.950 align:start position:0%
questions so i did the deep dive on the
rsas

00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
rsas
 
00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
um um i felt
 
00:36:49.349 --> 00:36:49.359 align:start position:0%
that there might be just a suggestion to
 
00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
valerie or
 
00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
to charlie folks over the lottery
 
00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
um in the proposed language it looks
 
00:36:58.310 --> 00:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
like you misquoted the subsection for
 
00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
charitable organizations
 
00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:03.599 align:start position:0%
your language says rsa 287-d
 
00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
colon 1 roman numeral 5 but that's
 
00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
actually the
 
00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:10.079 align:start position:0%
wrong subsection it should be roman
 
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
numeral four
 
00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
for charitable organizations uh i
 
00:37:15.349 --> 00:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
believe if i didn't
 
00:37:19.589 --> 00:37:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh bill for 287d on the general court
 
00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:24.310 align:start position:0%
uh bill for 287d on the general court
website

00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
website
 
00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
um but then i guess my other question
 
00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:27.750 align:start position:0%
um but then i guess my other question
about

00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:37:29.829 --> 00:37:29.839 align:start position:0%
this in general was that you know i
 
00:37:31.349 --> 00:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
think it's interesting that
 
00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
uh 7 colon 21 it looks at the definition
 
00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:42.550 align:start position:0%
uh 7 colon 21 it looks at the definition
of

00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
what a charitable trust is um and it
 
00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
looks like it's swooping up that kind of
 
00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:49.349 align:start position:0%
looks like it's swooping up that kind of
irs

00:37:49.349 --> 00:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
irs
 
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of the kinds of charitable
 
00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
organizations and purposes
 
00:38:01.109 --> 00:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
um so i think i think you know my only
 
00:38:01.829 --> 00:38:01.839 align:start position:0%
question is
 
00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
the language seems okay on its own to
 
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
include charitable trust but
 
00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
you know my my overall question is how
 
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
many charitable trusts do not fit into
 
00:38:13.349 --> 00:38:13.359 align:start position:0%
the category of terrible organizations
 
00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
that exist now and if we open the door
 
00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
here is it really a floodgate or is it
 
00:38:19.829 --> 00:38:19.839 align:start position:0%
really just one
 
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
a one-off kind of new hampshire feed is
 
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
the only
 
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
trust that's not fitting in to this
 
00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:26.150 align:start position:0%
trust that's not fitting in to this
category

00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
category
 
00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
so to answer your question
 
00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
representative thank you um that it
 
00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
you're correct there was a typo
 
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
the correct subsection you cited is
 
00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
accurate accurate it was a
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
transposition error on the email uh as
 
00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:38.310 align:start position:0%
transposition error on the email uh as
for

00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
the floodgate it's certainly in my time
 
00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
this is the first time that i've been
 
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
approached by a charitable trust
 
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
as to applying for this so
 
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
i don't imagine it's a floodgate i can't
 
00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
say for certain uh
 
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
valerie you you predate my time here so
 
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:58.390 --> 00:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
um i have we haven't run into this
 
00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
situation before i can't
 
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
say what will happen in the future but
 
00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
just as a quick follow-up um if i could
 
00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:11.109 align:start position:0%
just as a quick follow-up um if i could
just

00:39:11.109 --> 00:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
give everybody a little notation to
 
00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:14.320 align:start position:0%
check on their own
 
00:39:17.349 --> 00:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
it's rsa 7 colon 21
 
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
it defines charitable trust
 
00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
and then speaks about what a charitable
 
00:39:23.829 --> 00:39:23.839 align:start position:0%
organization would be
 
00:39:26.829 --> 00:39:26.839 align:start position:0%
as well and it's clear that there is a
 
00:39:26.839 --> 00:39:28.150 align:start position:0%
as well and it's clear that there is a
delineation

00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
delineation
 
00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:30.640 align:start position:0%
charitable organizations have 501 c 3
 
00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:31.349 align:start position:0%
charitable organizations have 501 c 3
status

00:39:31.349 --> 00:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
status
 
00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:34.720 align:start position:0%
but charitable trusts do not so
 
00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
the tax exempt status seems to be part
 
00:39:39.349 --> 00:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
of the reason why they were excluded
 
00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
possibly in the past um
 
00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
and then it also talks about section 170
 
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
of that
 
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
inner internal revenue code um
 
00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
terrible organizations that get
 
00:39:53.109 --> 00:39:53.119 align:start position:0%
deductions but they're not
 
00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
charitable deductions so it's just an
 
00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
interesting kind of
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
um note that our existing law has
 
00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
already kind of considered this
 
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
but in the past we excluded them so i'm
 
00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
wondering if
 
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
there's something we're not putting
 
00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:08.470 align:start position:0%
there's something we're not putting
together

00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:40:09.829 --> 00:40:09.839 align:start position:0%
that we should be cautious about
 
00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
including them suddenly so
 
00:40:15.829 --> 00:40:15.839 align:start position:0%
for my two cents thank you mr chair
 
00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
there is enough problems with this right
 
00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:20.630 align:start position:0%
there is enough problems with this right
now

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:40:25.829 --> 00:40:25.839 align:start position:0%
that we need to go into a have
 
00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
since we have not many bills committee
 
00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
as a whole
 
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
and that's what we were doing senate
 
00:40:38.930 --> 00:40:38.940 align:start position:0%
bill 27.
 
00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:42.710 align:start position:0%
bill 27.
[Music]

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
okay we have two other senators
 
00:40:54.069 --> 00:40:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:57.750 --> 00:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh i am wondering if the reason
 
00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
that they have not become a 501c3
 
00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
is that the charitable trust is partly
 
00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
in order to to
 
00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
provide for the prosperity of cactus
 
00:41:17.349 --> 00:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
which would probably disqualify them
 
00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:20.470 align:start position:0%
which would probably disqualify them
from

00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
from the 501c3 category i don't know
 
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
i do know that there are people who have
 
00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
abused 501c3
 
00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
and have have done that and it
 
00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:33.839 align:start position:0%
was illegal for them so um
 
00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
they're being legal about this
 
00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
um but the operation
 
00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
it the charitable trust itself i am
 
00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
positing may be on partly for the
 
00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
purpose of spreading the reputation
 
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
of of the donors which um
 
00:41:56.069 --> 00:41:56.079 align:start position:0%
is a perfectly valid thing to do but
 
00:41:57.910 --> 00:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
that may be why
 
00:42:01.109 --> 00:42:01.119 align:start position:0%
uh whenever they considered this before
 
00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
just thinking non-lawyer
 
00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
we're not comfortable with the answers
 
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
at this point in time
 
00:42:17.589 --> 00:42:17.599 align:start position:0%
represent romney followed by
 
00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
representative bromley mr chair
 
00:42:23.829 --> 00:42:23.839 align:start position:0%
yeah we have time uh we're not even a
 
00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
crossover yet
 
00:42:28.069 --> 00:42:28.079 align:start position:0%
uh and this is the senate bill so
 
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
uh i i really think we should work this
 
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
bill um
 
00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
i think the major concern was what was
 
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
in these these uh
 
00:42:37.589 --> 00:42:37.599 align:start position:0%
internal revenue codes uh what what kind
 
00:42:40.069 --> 00:42:40.079 align:start position:0%
of organizations are we talking about
 
00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
so i think that would be the first step
 
00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
now normal times we would we would have
 
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that would roll up their
 
00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
sleeves and uh
 
00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
and dig into these things i mean we
 
00:42:49.829 --> 00:42:49.839 align:start position:0%
could do this as a committee
 
00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
uh but i think we i think i know i want
 
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
to understand what's in the current
 
00:42:57.349 --> 00:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
you know why not let's do it now uh
 
00:42:59.349 --> 00:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
you know the 501 sees you know three
 
00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
four seven eight
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
nine ten and nineteen and then see how
 
00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
that matches up with
 
00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
charlie's police amendment um
 
00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:08.470 align:start position:0%
charlie's police amendment um
[Music]

00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:10.720 align:start position:0%
so i you know i think we just gotta roll
 
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
pick a point starting point and roll our
 
00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
sleeves up and
 
00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
and then and then uh also i think rick
 
00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
newman also had some suggested changes
 
00:43:25.349 --> 00:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman okay um
 
00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
anybody else on comments otherwise
 
00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to hold this for committee
 
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
as a whole
 
00:43:40.069 --> 00:43:40.079 align:start position:0%
session and i'll probably draw
 
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
on a few of you to be the point people
 
00:43:49.829 --> 00:43:49.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
we have two other senate bills mr chair
 
00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
can i just interject one more thing
 
00:43:57.829 --> 00:43:57.839 align:start position:0%
yes representative i think on 27
 
00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh since we passed the other build uh
 
00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:01.670 align:start position:0%
uh since we passed the other build uh
roman

00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
roman
 
00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:05.589 align:start position:0%
roman
um

00:44:05.589 --> 00:44:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
the section one of the bill
 
00:44:10.069 --> 00:44:10.079 align:start position:0%
would automatically i think we just take
 
00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
this out of 27 because we we already
 
00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh changed the licensing dates of
 
00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming
 
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
in another build so that that that's one
 
00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:20.240 align:start position:0%
off the list and then there's three
 
00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
other things that
 
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
that are in 27 that we need to work on
 
00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
thank you but uh mr chair rick newman
 
00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
was on the call i think he may be on uh
 
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
to discuss
 
00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
his uh his amendment as well that i
 
00:44:36.309 --> 00:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
think crossed a couple of these bills
 
00:44:37.829 --> 00:44:37.839 align:start position:0%
just just want to make you aware of that
 
00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative does he have
 
00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
comments on this one
 
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
i think it covered a couple of the bills
 
00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
i think it may be yes
 
00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:52.950 align:start position:0%
i think it may be yes
[Music]

00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:52.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:44:56.069 --> 00:44:56.079 align:start position:0%
he's not in the attendees list okay
 
00:44:59.190 --> 00:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
i made him aware of the meeting so he's
 
00:44:59.670 --> 00:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
not there
 
00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:12.069 --> 00:45:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
one of the remaining two bills is senate
 
00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:15.190 align:start position:0%
one of the remaining two bills is senate
bill

00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:45:18.069 --> 00:45:18.079 align:start position:0%
22 relative to the sale of lucky seven
 
00:45:18.079 --> 00:45:19.109 align:start position:0%
22 relative to the sale of lucky seven
tickets

00:45:19.109 --> 00:45:19.119 align:start position:0%
tickets
 
00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:22.720 align:start position:0%
which is different from really the other
 
00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
and this allows the play of electric
 
00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
select e7 names sets the limit on
 
00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
election seven deal size
 
00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
and sets the maximum price per like to
 
00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
and i do see rick newman testified the
 
00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
last time on this
 
00:45:45.589 --> 00:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
and he's not in the attendance list
 
00:45:49.109 --> 00:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:51.280 align:start position:0%

00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
senate bill 22
 
00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:56.240 align:start position:0%

00:45:58.790 --> 00:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
one that contacted me
 
00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:00.960 align:start position:0%

i don't know if he's on
 
00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
if he wants to speak he's also a
 
00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:08.390 align:start position:0%
if he wants to speak he's also a
lobbyist

00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:18.640 align:start position:0%

i represent diamond distributors one of
 
00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
the largest
 
00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
paper lucky seven ticket distributors
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
in the state and we are opposed to
 
00:46:43.589 --> 00:46:43.599 align:start position:0%
section one and section two of the bill
 
00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
i do recall representative abrami asked
 
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
me about section three
 
00:46:50.069 --> 00:46:50.079 align:start position:0%
um to which we would be willing to you
 
00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
know work on an amendment with the
 
00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
committee to bring back the 25 cent
 
00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
ticket which we believe was an oversight
 
00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:56.390 align:start position:0%
ticket which we believe was an oversight
uh

00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
last summer when the dollar ticket was
 
00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
introduced through omnibus legislation
 
00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
the language that was adopted did kind
 
00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
of get rid of 25 cent tickets at that
 
00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:07.670 align:start position:0%
of get rid of 25 cent tickets at that
time

00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:47:10.309 --> 00:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
but we are opposed to sections one in
 
00:47:11.589 --> 00:47:11.599 align:start position:0%
section two
 
00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
in my testimony to the committee i i
 
00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
stated that
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
removing the paper ticket
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
being dispensed out of these electronic
 
00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
gaming devices
 
00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
further blares the line between a lucky
 
00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
seven dispensing device
 
00:47:29.109 --> 00:47:29.119 align:start position:0%
and a slot machine and i did send the
 
00:47:29.119 --> 00:47:30.069 align:start position:0%
and a slot machine and i did send the
committee

00:47:30.069 --> 00:47:30.079 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
after my testimony a copy of the
 
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
superior court's ruling on these
 
00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
machines in
 
00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
in why these rules were put forward that
 
00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
in why it states in law
 
00:47:43.829 --> 00:47:43.839 align:start position:0%
you know that they shall not be in the
 
00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
nature of a slot machine
 
00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
and i also included i believe the
 
00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
legislative history for
 
00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
house bill 348 from session year i think
 
00:47:52.069 --> 00:47:52.079 align:start position:0%
it was 2010
 
00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
2011 which gives you the
 
00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh the timeline of the adoption of that
 
00:47:57.920 --> 00:47:58.549 align:start position:0%
uh the timeline of the adoption of that
language

00:47:58.549 --> 00:47:58.559 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
in the in that's the bill that was put
 
00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:01.589 align:start position:0%
in the in that's the bill that was put
forward

00:48:01.589 --> 00:48:01.599 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
that now provides us with language that
 
00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
states shall not be in the nature of a
 
00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
slot machine
 
00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
and i'll also point out in the house
 
00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
version of house bill 348 from that
 
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
session year
 
00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
um the house adopted language that
 
00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
actually banned
 
00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
these electronic lucky seven machines
 
00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
and the senate removed
 
00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:33.430 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:36.640 align:start position:0%
thank you um so my
 
00:48:40.549 --> 00:48:40.559 align:start position:0%
question is is about the paper and uh
 
00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
what what purpose do you think the
 
00:48:50.069 --> 00:48:50.079 align:start position:0%
the paper aspect of these machines
 
00:48:50.079 --> 00:48:51.780 align:start position:0%
the paper aspect of these machines
serves

00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:51.790 align:start position:0%
serves
 
00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:54.309 align:start position:0%
serves
[Music]

00:48:54.309 --> 00:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
is there a purpose served by these apart
 
00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
from dropping out the bottom of the
 
00:48:59.030 --> 00:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
machine and
 
00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:02.240 align:start position:0%
exactly what is it my understanding is
 
00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:49:05.589 --> 00:49:05.599 align:start position:0%
outcome of these uh what they are is a
 
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
digital version of an instant lucky 7
 
00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:08.150 align:start position:0%
digital version of an instant lucky 7
ticket

00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
ticket
 
00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
the outcome is to be displayed on the
 
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
screen and also
 
00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
on the ticket that comes out of the
 
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.030 align:start position:0%
on the ticket that comes out of the
bottom

00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
bottom
 
00:49:17.109 --> 00:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
the ticket plays the role as it it's
 
00:49:19.109 --> 00:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
supposed to differentiate these machines
 
00:49:19.119 --> 00:49:19.750 align:start position:0%
supposed to differentiate these machines
from

00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
electronic gaming devices in
 
00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
in the superior court ruling that i sent
 
00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
to the committee which was also
 
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
affirmed by the supreme court
 
00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
that the ticket
 
00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
must come out and and the reason is that
 
00:49:39.589 --> 00:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
there was a manufacturer i forget the
 
00:49:40.309 --> 00:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
name of them
 
00:49:42.069 --> 00:49:42.079 align:start position:0%
that came into the state and they had a
 
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
product that would dispense these
 
00:49:47.109 --> 00:49:47.119 align:start position:0%
these tickets and it would also display
 
00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
the outcome on the screen
 
00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
well there were no no rules that allowed
 
00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
these machines to exist
 
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
so this manufacturing company petitioned
 
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
the charitable
 
00:50:00.309 --> 00:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
gaming and in racing the
 
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
commission at the time so this is prior
 
00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
to it going over the lottery
 
00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
requesting rules to allow these machines
 
00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
to be put into
 
00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:08.720 align:start position:0%
you know like fraternal organizations
 
00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:09.829 align:start position:0%
you know like fraternal organizations
and

00:50:09.829 --> 00:50:09.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
bingo halls and the commission at the
 
00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
time refused to write
 
00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
rules and then there was house bill 348
 
00:50:20.309 --> 00:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
that was put uh forward i think it
 
00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
fought the following year
 
00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
which in the house version banned these
 
00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
machines from even coming
 
00:50:29.829 --> 00:50:29.839 align:start position:0%
into the state so the commission delayed
 
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
putting forward any rules well then
 
00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
house bill 348 passed
 
00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
but it passed you know with the senate
 
00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:38.720 align:start position:0%
removing that language
 
00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
in this new language that said shall not
 
00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
be in the nature of a slot machine
 
00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
so the manufacturers petitioned again
 
00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:46.640 align:start position:0%
but this time to the courts
 
00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
and the courts told the racing
 
00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
commission racing and charitable gaming
 
00:50:53.349 --> 00:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
commission that they had to go back and
 
00:50:54.309 --> 00:50:54.319 align:start position:0%
write rules
 
00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
to allow these machines but but the
 
00:50:58.470 --> 00:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
rules didn't necessarily have to
 
00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
say what the manufacturer wanted them to
 
00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
say so that's when we got these devices
 
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
that were put forward in i think rules
 
00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
in 2015
 
00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
which just which said you had to uh
 
00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
which were in line with the statute that
 
00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
said you had to display the outcome of
 
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
the ticket on the screen and had to
 
00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
shoot out a
 
00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:16.640 align:start position:0%
ticket out of the bottom okay and that
 
00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
was from being in the nature of a slot
 
00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:19.430 align:start position:0%
was from being in the nature of a slot
machine

00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
machine
 
00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
so if i may follow up
 
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
um yeah i'm still trying to understand
 
00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
depart from that legal history
 
00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
um what sort of functional purpose they
 
00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:33.750 align:start position:0%
um what sort of functional purpose they
serve

00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
serve
 
00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
they're kicking out the bottom of the
 
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
machine we've heard a lot of testimony
 
00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
to the fact that nobody
 
00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
looks at them and i'm wondering do they
 
00:51:44.549 --> 00:51:44.559 align:start position:0%
slow down the game at all
 
00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
do they affect the rate of play
 
00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
um can you speak to sort of the function
 
00:51:56.470 --> 00:51:56.480 align:start position:0%
played by these paper tickets apart from
 
00:51:59.430 --> 00:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
dropping out the bottom so i've played
 
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
these machines and i think i might have
 
00:52:02.309 --> 00:52:02.319 align:start position:0%
been the only person to ever take the
 
00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
tickets out of the
 
00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
out of the bucket that it comes that's
 
00:52:07.349 --> 00:52:07.359 align:start position:0%
on the bottom that collects them
 
00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
um the rate of play used to be five
 
00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
seconds so every five seconds you could
 
00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
tap the button
 
00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
and it's my understanding and i don't
 
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
know the exact internal mechanisms of
 
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
these machines is that they print these
 
00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:20.309 align:start position:0%
these machines is that they print these
tickets

00:52:20.309 --> 00:52:20.319 align:start position:0%
tickets
 
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
as you go through as you go through the
 
00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
deal so it's printed on the fly
 
00:52:27.589 --> 00:52:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh but the rules adopted last summer
 
00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
i actually allow these machines to be
 
00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
played every two and a half seconds so i
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
haven't played a machine since so i
 
00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
could not tell you if it actually slows
 
00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:35.109 align:start position:0%
could not tell you if it actually slows
the

00:52:35.109 --> 00:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
machine down to a rate of play that's
 
00:52:39.349 --> 00:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
slower than that to print it out
 
00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
um but you know
 
00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
the tickets serve the purpose of that
 
00:52:46.309 --> 00:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
it's not in the nature of a slot machine
 
00:52:49.109 --> 00:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
and yeah i understand that but we could
 
00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
always change that language
 
00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
um if that was the preference of the
 
00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:55.030 align:start position:0%
um if that was the preference of the
committee

00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:52:58.309 --> 00:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
so it's important history but
 
00:53:02.069 --> 00:53:02.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean i'm yeah
 
00:53:09.589 --> 00:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:12.640 align:start position:0%
there she goes okay so i that's
 
00:53:14.309 --> 00:53:14.319 align:start position:0%
that's my question i think it's been
 
00:53:16.309 --> 00:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
answered so i'm also thank you
 
00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
okay um represent romney's followed by
 
00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh you wait yeah gallery that
 
00:53:28.790 --> 00:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
would go yes yeah i can wait
 
00:53:32.309 --> 00:53:32.319 align:start position:0%
valerie um yes i just wanted to clarify
 
00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
that the ticket printing has nothing to
 
00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
do with in the nature of a slot machine
 
00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
the the electronic machines are required
 
00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
to print a ticket because the statute
 
00:53:43.750 --> 00:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
says that lucky seven
 
00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
has to be a dual uh paper
 
00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
double-sided ticket you know a a break
 
00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
open featured ticket
 
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
that's why the machines print a ticket
 
00:53:56.069 --> 00:53:56.079 align:start position:0%
not because it's
 
00:53:57.430 --> 00:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
would otherwise be in the nature of a
 
00:53:59.109 --> 00:53:59.119 align:start position:0%
slot machine we've just
 
00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
defined what in the nature of a slot
 
00:54:02.230 --> 00:54:02.240 align:start position:0%
machine is
 
00:54:06.150 --> 00:54:06.160 align:start position:0%
in our rules and we've defined it as
 
00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
um it's not a random
 
00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
a slot goes on random wins
 
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
and this is a defined deal with a set
 
00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
number of winners and losers and
 
00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:16.950 align:start position:0%
number of winners and losers and
therefore

00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
it is not in the nature of a slot
 
00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:21.910 align:start position:0%
it is not in the nature of a slot
machine

00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:25.589 --> 00:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
thank you representative romney
 
00:54:27.589 --> 00:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
so i got two questions one one on this
 
00:54:27.599 --> 00:54:28.710 align:start position:0%
so i got two questions one one on this
topic

00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:28.720 align:start position:0%
topic
 
00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
so so what we're saying is that that if
 
00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
we did away with the piece of paper
 
00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
coming at the bottom
 
00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
that we wouldn't be in violation of what
 
00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:38.720 align:start position:0%
the courts said to do is that what i'm
 
00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:41.589 align:start position:0%
the courts said to do is that what i'm
understanding

00:54:41.589 --> 00:54:41.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:44.240 align:start position:0%
uh tyler or valerie well start with
 
00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:45.270 align:start position:0%
uh tyler or valerie well start with
tyler

00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
tyler
 
00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
or valerie why don't you go ahead i'll
 
00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
show your hand up
 
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
hey the um courts did not require us to
 
00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
allow these machines
 
00:54:58.470 --> 00:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
what it said was you can't deny
 
00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
the manufacturer if you don't have rules
 
00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
that say
 
00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
what qualifies and what does not qualify
 
00:55:05.349 --> 00:55:05.359 align:start position:0%
as an acceptable ticket
 
00:55:08.549 --> 00:55:08.559 align:start position:0%
or a device so we had to
 
00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
write rules that differentiated what is
 
00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:11.750 align:start position:0%
write rules that differentiated what is
good

00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:55:14.309 --> 00:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
and what is not good for um being
 
00:55:15.670 --> 00:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
approved as a
 
00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
lucky seven device okay so the answer is
 
00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:20.720 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be in violation of a court
 
00:55:22.309 --> 00:55:22.319 align:start position:0%
order going way back when
 
00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
is what what i'm hearing we would we
 
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
would not
 
00:55:28.549 --> 00:55:28.559 align:start position:0%
be in violation okay so we we can go
 
00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
ahead and do this if we wanted to okay
 
00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
so i'm gonna go move to the uh uh
 
00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
second uh mr chair can i move to the
 
00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
second question i had unless you had a
 
00:55:41.829 --> 00:55:41.839 align:start position:0%
follow-up mr chair
 
00:55:46.829 --> 00:55:46.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
on the second uh pay you know
 
00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:52.559 align:start position:0%
lines 10 through 13 uh the second
 
00:55:52.559 --> 00:55:54.710 align:start position:0%
lines 10 through 13 uh the second
section

00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:55:57.910 --> 00:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
so currently the the statute reads
 
00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
a licensed distributor shall pay a fee
 
00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
of 15
 
00:56:04.630 --> 00:56:04.640 align:start position:0%
per deal of a pull tab of pull tab
 
00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:06.470 align:start position:0%
per deal of a pull tab of pull tab
tickets

00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
tickets
 
00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
so is that uh i'm gonna ask valerie this
 
00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
question and you have your hand up
 
00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:11.190 align:start position:0%
question and you have your hand up
anyway

00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
00:56:14.309 --> 00:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
uh so that fifteen dollars is that
 
00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:16.559 align:start position:0%
fifteen dollars go to the state
 
00:56:20.230 --> 00:56:20.240 align:start position:0%
and uh is it for any size deal
 
00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:23.270 align:start position:0%
and uh is it for any size deal
currently

00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
that's correct the deal fee goes to the
 
00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
state and it is for
 
00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
any size deal and we set the by rule we
 
00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
set the deal size to a max of 3 500
 
00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:36.309 align:start position:0%
set the deal size to a max of 3 500
tickets

00:56:36.309 --> 00:56:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
okay and is that
 
00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
is that why in this because now there's
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
a follow-up
 
00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
in the bold right after the purr we now
 
00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
see 3 500 tickets as the
 
00:56:55.109 --> 00:56:55.119 align:start position:0%
or any portion thereof contained in each
 
00:56:58.230 --> 00:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
deal well okay so are we just putting
 
00:57:00.069 --> 00:57:00.079 align:start position:0%
that language in
 
00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh because it was silent before and it
 
00:57:04.150 --> 00:57:04.160 align:start position:0%
was in rules now we're putting it in the
 
00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:05.990 align:start position:0%
was in rules now we're putting it in the
bill

00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
um by by adding that
 
00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
words those words if we were to
 
00:57:14.789 --> 00:57:14.799 align:start position:0%
increase the deal size under the current
 
00:57:14.799 --> 00:57:15.829 align:start position:0%
increase the deal size under the current
statute

00:57:15.829 --> 00:57:15.839 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
the state would lose money because we'd
 
00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
get 15
 
00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's 3 500 tickets or 14
 
00:57:22.950 --> 00:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
000 tickets
 
00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
i got it so by revising this we get 15
 
00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
for every 3 500 or any portion thereof
 
00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
right because okay thank you because
 
00:57:34.710 --> 00:57:34.720 align:start position:0%
that was going to be my next question
 
00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
is all right i wasn't reading this
 
00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
correctly so
 
00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:40.640 align:start position:0%
15 per five hundred tickets because the
 
00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
real essence of this is that
 
00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
the commission shall not authorize a
 
00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:45.839 align:start position:0%
deal size the new pieces that we're
 
00:57:46.789 --> 00:57:46.799 align:start position:0%
really saying the
 
00:57:48.549 --> 00:57:48.559 align:start position:0%
uh the deal size can be up to fourteen
 
00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
thousand tickets correct
 
00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
that's correct that would be uh what uh
 
00:57:55.589 --> 00:57:55.599 align:start position:0%
three deals
 
00:57:59.750 --> 00:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
so we would get if if we did this
 
00:58:03.030 --> 00:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:05.670 --> 00:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
yeah whatever yeah you're right four
 
00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:06.470 align:start position:0%
yeah whatever yeah you're right four
deals

00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
deals
 
00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh so we would get sixty dollars for
 
00:58:10.069 --> 00:58:10.079 align:start position:0%
that okay
 
00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to make sure that we
 
00:58:13.430 --> 00:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
weren't still getting fifteen dollars
 
00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
per deal for a fourteen thousand
 
00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
ticket deal so and it's
 
00:58:23.190 --> 00:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
my final question follow-up is
 
00:58:27.109 --> 00:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
is this both for the pull tabs
 
00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
the paper pull tab deals as well as the
 
00:58:35.109 --> 00:58:35.119 align:start position:0%
uh machine deals
 
00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
yes the the deal fee applies to all
 
00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
deals regardless of whether or not
 
00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:39.270 align:start position:0%
deals regardless of whether or not
they're

00:58:39.270 --> 00:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:58:42.069 --> 00:58:42.079 align:start position:0%
um traditional paper or electronic okay
 
00:58:42.630 --> 00:58:42.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i'm sorry i may
 
00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
possibly have missed this question
 
00:58:55.030 --> 00:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
when i was being called by some one of
 
00:58:57.109 --> 00:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
the people that i have to talk to in
 
00:58:57.829 --> 00:58:57.839 align:start position:0%
order to
 
00:58:59.510 --> 00:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
for us to finish figuring out what we're
 
00:59:01.109 --> 00:59:01.119 align:start position:0%
doing next week
 
00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
on and but
 
00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
as i understand it the lottery by
 
00:59:12.870 --> 00:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
itself has increased the permissible
 
00:59:16.630 --> 00:59:16.640 align:start position:0%
uh size of the deal to 14 000 tickets by
 
00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
combining deals
 
00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
and the lottery by itself
 
00:59:24.870 --> 00:59:24.880 align:start position:0%
has increased the the
 
00:59:27.349 --> 00:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
speed of play to every two and a half
 
00:59:27.359 --> 00:59:28.470 align:start position:0%
speed of play to every two and a half
seconds

00:59:28.470 --> 00:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
seconds
 
00:59:30.870 --> 00:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
and i want to know if there is any
 
00:59:32.230 --> 00:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
functional difference
 
00:59:35.430 --> 00:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
as versus behind the scene that no
 
00:59:37.109 --> 00:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
player can see
 
00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
difference between these and slot
 
00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
machines now
 
00:59:43.829 --> 00:59:43.839 align:start position:0%
and why why we're just playing games
 
00:59:45.430 --> 00:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
with this we're doing it with the
 
00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:46.150 align:start position:0%
with this we're doing it with the
historic

00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:46.160 align:start position:0%
historic
 
00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
racing machines we're doing it with
 
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
these they can compete with each other
 
00:59:54.309 --> 00:59:54.319 align:start position:0%
uh but these are all over the place
 
00:59:59.270 --> 00:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
and um this
 
01:00:02.470 --> 01:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
15 years ago or so they changed
 
01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:06.079 align:start position:0%
on they put put
 
01:00:09.030 --> 01:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
heavy regulations related to jail cars
 
01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:10.640 align:start position:0%
so jail car could stop
 
01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
things like this and i'm a little
 
01:00:18.309 --> 01:00:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:26.069 --> 01:00:26.079 align:start position:0%
i'm not exactly honestly i'm not sure
 
01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
which question
 
01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
i'm answering um with with regard to
 
01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
the the first part about the um
 
01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
the the two seconds we have reduced it
 
01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
down to two seconds that's from the time
 
01:00:42.789 --> 01:00:42.799 align:start position:0%
the ticket
 
01:00:45.190 --> 01:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
starts to complete reveal it has to have
 
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
two second pause so that the player can
 
01:00:49.829 --> 01:00:49.839 align:start position:0%
actually know what the ticket reads
 
01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
before it goes to the next one
 
01:00:53.109 --> 01:00:53.119 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't sound like a lot of time
 
01:00:57.829 --> 01:00:57.839 align:start position:0%
but it actually is a lot of time
 
01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
could you tell me how often you can push
 
01:01:04.789 --> 01:01:04.799 align:start position:0%
a button on a slot machine these days
 
01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
i i don't regulate slots i don't know
 
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
anything about slot machines
 
01:01:11.829 --> 01:01:11.839 align:start position:0%
they aren't something that i am familiar
 
01:01:11.839 --> 01:01:15.910 align:start position:0%
they aren't something that i am familiar
with

01:01:15.910 --> 01:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:19.829 --> 01:01:19.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
and the the the deals were also combined
 
01:01:26.470 --> 01:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
so that you could have 14 000 tickets
 
01:01:29.589 --> 01:01:29.599 align:start position:0%
at a time and nobody would
 
01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
would know whether you'd won all of the
 
01:01:36.309 --> 01:01:36.319 align:start position:0%
the uh prizes or
 
01:01:39.190 --> 01:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
so what we did um is we did allow four
 
01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
deals to be sold
 
01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
at the same time this is something that
 
01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
is commonly done
 
01:01:46.630 --> 01:01:46.640 align:start position:0%
even before we put it in regulations
 
01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
when um
 
01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
a fraternal home may have like a
 
01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
fishbowl where they put a bunch of
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
tickets in a bowl and people just pick
 
01:01:54.309 --> 01:01:54.319 align:start position:0%
them out and
 
01:01:58.309 --> 01:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
and buy a ticket through the fishbowl um
 
01:02:01.270 --> 01:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
so we basically just allowed put in
 
01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:01.990 align:start position:0%
so we basically just allowed put in
regulation

01:02:01.990 --> 01:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
01:02:04.069 --> 01:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
that was allowed up to four deals at one
 
01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
are you all set represent me
 
01:02:25.349 --> 01:02:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
just want to follow up on that uh just
 
01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
to make sure we all understand
 
01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
so that's so that you just mentioned
 
01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
paper tickets putting it in my bowl
 
01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh it's four deals we still get 60 out
 
01:02:36.549 --> 01:02:36.559 align:start position:0%
of that
 
01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
as a state correct
 
01:02:42.789 --> 01:02:42.799 align:start position:0%
that is correct okay but uh
 
01:02:45.109 --> 01:02:45.119 align:start position:0%
and my understanding from last uh when
 
01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
we first heard the bill
 
01:02:49.589 --> 01:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
is that the electronic machines you can
 
01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
do the same thing
 
01:02:53.589 --> 01:02:53.599 align:start position:0%
you can you can combine deals on the
 
01:02:55.589 --> 01:02:55.599 align:start position:0%
electronic machines as well and is that
 
01:02:55.599 --> 01:02:57.510 align:start position:0%
electronic machines as well and is that
happening

01:02:57.510 --> 01:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:02:59.750 --> 01:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
that's correct that's we put that in
 
01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:00.870 align:start position:0%
that's correct that's we put that in
regulations

01:03:00.870 --> 01:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
01:03:03.270 --> 01:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they were limiting it
 
01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
to no more than
 
01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
four deals at one time
 
01:03:09.270 --> 01:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
right what would be the difference
 
01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:11.349 align:start position:0%
right what would be the difference
between

01:03:11.349 --> 01:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:03:13.510 --> 01:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
what we're doing now i think it was
 
01:03:14.789 --> 01:03:14.799 align:start position:0%
asked a minute ago but
 
01:03:16.789 --> 01:03:16.799 align:start position:0%
what was what we're doing now what this
 
01:03:18.069 --> 01:03:18.079 align:start position:0%
bill is
 
01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
is saying um so currently
 
01:03:24.789 --> 01:03:24.799 align:start position:0%
you have four deals they're made up of
 
01:03:27.029 --> 01:03:27.039 align:start position:0%
no more than 3 500 tickets so there's a
 
01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
certain set of winners and losers in
 
01:03:30.309 --> 01:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
each of those deals
 
01:03:32.230 --> 01:03:32.240 align:start position:0%
but you're limited on your prize
 
01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:33.589 align:start position:0%
but you're limited on your prize
structures

01:03:33.589 --> 01:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
structures
 
01:03:36.549 --> 01:03:36.559 align:start position:0%
if you're allowed to make a single deal
 
01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
that has
 
01:03:41.029 --> 01:03:41.039 align:start position:0%
a 14 000 tickets you're much
 
01:03:44.549 --> 01:03:44.559 align:start position:0%
more able to create
 
01:03:47.029 --> 01:03:47.039 align:start position:0%
honor games games with more prizes
 
01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
different prize structures
 
01:03:51.349 --> 01:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
it increases their um flexibility on
 
01:03:53.349 --> 01:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
what types of games and offerings they
 
01:03:55.990 --> 01:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
can provide
 
01:03:59.270 --> 01:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
okay just trying to understand thank you
 
01:04:03.270 --> 01:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
can the can the participants
 
01:04:06.309 --> 01:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
want speaking mute their mics because
 
01:04:06.319 --> 01:04:07.990 align:start position:0%
want speaking mute their mics because
there's

01:04:07.990 --> 01:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
excuse me perhaps
 
01:04:29.349 --> 01:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
this question could be answered by uh
 
01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
representative abrami
 
01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
i am wondering there's a lot of emotion
 
01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
and misunderstanding and happening
 
01:04:44.549 --> 01:04:44.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:47.910 --> 01:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
representative abrami believes that
 
01:04:51.829 --> 01:04:51.839 align:start position:0%
it's now easier for people to
 
01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
get into this whether they're going to
 
01:04:55.670 --> 01:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
be more or less
 
01:04:58.870 --> 01:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
winners or losers what what is
 
01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
what is the direction of all these
 
01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
questions and these numbers
 
01:05:05.270 --> 01:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
i don't sort of get it in a context i
 
01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
don't gamble
 
01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
i had never been to a machine i don't
 
01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
understand what we're really talking
 
01:05:13.029 --> 01:05:13.039 align:start position:0%
about i'm sorry and perhaps
 
01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
you could just make a
 
01:05:19.109 --> 01:05:19.119 align:start position:0%
sentence or two is to are we talking
 
01:05:20.470 --> 01:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
about making it
 
01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
easy just to take money from people who
 
01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:24.710 align:start position:0%
easy just to take money from people who
are

01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
gambling or making it more favorable to
 
01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
the state what is the
 
01:05:32.549 --> 01:05:32.559 align:start position:0%
thrust of these changes
 
01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm just trying to learn about this
 
01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
bill this is not my bill
 
01:05:38.950 --> 01:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
uh uh what i was trying to understand is
 
01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:40.150 align:start position:0%
uh uh what i was trying to understand is
is

01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
it it sounds like we're already doing
 
01:05:43.510 --> 01:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
these things
 
01:05:44.710 --> 01:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
and it looks like we're going to put
 
01:05:46.789 --> 01:05:46.799 align:start position:0%
into statute it may be
 
01:05:49.349 --> 01:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
a little uh what what's already
 
01:05:49.359 --> 01:05:50.710 align:start position:0%
a little uh what what's already
happening

01:05:50.710 --> 01:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:05:53.430 --> 01:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
uh but i was trying to also get at what
 
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
i want to make sure
 
01:05:57.910 --> 01:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
that what's happening now uh the state
 
01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
isn't going to isn't going to get isn't
 
01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
getting less money than
 
01:06:06.069 --> 01:06:06.079 align:start position:0%
what the bill says and it sounds like
 
01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
it's going to be identical
 
01:06:11.670 --> 01:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
the 15 per 3 500 tickets
 
01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh but let me i do have another question
 
01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
just maybe think of another question i
 
01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
just can't help myself
 
01:06:19.270 --> 01:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
but that's all i'm trying to do here uh
 
01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
trying to understand
 
01:06:24.549 --> 01:06:24.559 align:start position:0%
uh where are we where are we now
 
01:06:25.829 --> 01:06:25.839 align:start position:0%
and what does this bill do that we
 
01:06:28.390 --> 01:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
aren't doing now and
 
01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
what does it mean to the state revenue
 
01:06:33.029 --> 01:06:33.039 align:start position:0%
so your questions really are the same as
 
01:06:33.039 --> 01:06:33.829 align:start position:0%
so your questions really are the same as
mine

01:06:33.829 --> 01:06:33.839 align:start position:0%
mine
 
01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so do you have any
 
01:06:39.270 --> 01:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
have you learned something in the last
 
01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
10 minutes that yeah well i'm just
 
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
clarifying my own mind
 
01:06:46.150 --> 01:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
i mean that's uh i'm just clarifying
 
01:06:49.029 --> 01:06:49.039 align:start position:0%
where we're at what's in these i'm not
 
01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
quite sure
 
01:06:51.510 --> 01:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
how much way i'm voting on these either
 
01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
uh other than the
 
01:06:53.829 --> 01:06:53.839 align:start position:0%
the last section which i was going to
 
01:06:56.230 --> 01:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
raise my hand again i do support putting
 
01:06:59.029 --> 01:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
making sure we put the 25 uh ticket back
 
01:06:59.039 --> 01:06:59.990 align:start position:0%
making sure we put the 25 uh ticket back
in

01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
yes um so i i don't want to say that if
 
01:07:05.190 --> 01:07:05.200 align:start position:0%
even if we don't go with the first two
 
01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
sections i think we
 
01:07:09.510 --> 01:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
saved the third section is my that's my
 
01:07:11.349 --> 01:07:11.359 align:start position:0%
preliminary feeling but
 
01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
uh we need the community to keep on
 
01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
discussing this
 
01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
how everybody else feels about the first
 
01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
first and second section
 
01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:21.839 align:start position:0%
so are you all set representative tucker
 
01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:23.720 align:start position:0%
i am thank you
 
01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
are you muted sorry thank you mr chair
 
01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
i have a question for the lottery
 
01:07:38.230 --> 01:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
commission um
 
01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
i was just reading through rsa 287
 
01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
uh dash e in regards to distributors and
 
01:07:48.950 --> 01:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
manufacturers of bingo supplies and
 
01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:50.390 align:start position:0%
manufacturers of bingo supplies and
equipment

01:07:50.390 --> 01:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
01:07:53.990 --> 01:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
it states here that um all lucky seven
 
01:07:55.270 --> 01:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
vending machines sold
 
01:07:57.750 --> 01:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
leased or rented in the state are
 
01:07:57.760 --> 01:07:58.789 align:start position:0%
leased or rented in the state are
licensed

01:07:58.789 --> 01:07:58.799 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
and that the distributors have to hold a
 
01:08:03.109 --> 01:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
license for lucky seven
 
01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
tickets in order to distribute
 
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
the bingo paper supplies or electronic
 
01:08:11.430 --> 01:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
bingo player systems
 
01:08:14.069 --> 01:08:14.079 align:start position:0%
and lucky seven vending machines so my
 
01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
question is
 
01:08:19.189 --> 01:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
if we remove the paper ticket
 
01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
does that mean that these people would
 
01:08:25.030 --> 01:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
not need to be licensed
 
01:08:27.510 --> 01:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
no they would still need to be licensed
 
01:08:28.789 --> 01:08:28.799 align:start position:0%
they are distributing
 
01:08:31.349 --> 01:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
um bingo and lucky seven products and to
 
01:08:32.789 --> 01:08:32.799 align:start position:0%
do that you need a license
 
01:08:34.590 --> 01:08:34.600 align:start position:0%
you need a license distributor and the
 
01:08:36.829 --> 01:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
manufacturers need to be licensed as
 
01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
well but
 
01:08:40.229 --> 01:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
it says here in this section that
 
01:08:42.709 --> 01:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
there's a fee for the paper
 
01:08:44.229 --> 01:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
is that something that would no longer
 
01:08:47.269 --> 01:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
um if you're referring to the deal fee
 
01:08:55.829 --> 01:08:55.839 align:start position:0%
it's based on the deal so a deal
 
01:08:57.910 --> 01:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
is says regardless of whether or not
 
01:08:58.870 --> 01:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
it's paper
 
01:09:01.749 --> 01:09:01.759 align:start position:0%
or electronic okay i'm not i'd have to
 
01:09:03.749 --> 01:09:03.759 align:start position:0%
look to see exactly what section you're
 
01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
if there's something if that's something
 
01:09:08.789 --> 01:09:08.799 align:start position:0%
different than what
 
01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking of okay i was looking at
 
01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
section 287-e colon8
 
01:09:18.070 --> 01:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
a but um
 
01:09:19.669 --> 01:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
yeah it looks to me that there's not
 
01:09:22.149 --> 01:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
only a fee for a license but also
 
01:09:26.309 --> 01:09:26.319 align:start position:0%
possibly a fee related to the
 
01:09:29.349 --> 01:09:29.359 align:start position:0%
paper supply for these machines and i'm
 
01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
just wondering if we
 
01:09:32.070 --> 01:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
get rid of the tickets does that mean a
 
01:09:37.189 --> 01:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:40.229 --> 01:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
section 8-a is just
 
01:09:43.349 --> 01:09:43.359 align:start position:0%
regard to their license fees
 
01:09:46.229 --> 01:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
um so that's really the five ten
 
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for the distributors
 
01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:49.910 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for the distributors
that's

01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:09:51.910 --> 01:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
for the right to distribute to
 
01:09:54.070 --> 01:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
distribute the
 
01:09:57.430 --> 01:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
the bingo and lucky seven products um
 
01:09:59.110 --> 01:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
it has nothing to and then they have to
 
01:10:00.870 --> 01:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
have a fifty thousand dollar bond with
 
01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
the state but that doesn't have anything
 
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:10:06.149 --> 01:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
with um whether or not they sell paper
 
01:10:06.630 --> 01:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
or not
 
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:12.870 --> 01:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
okay any more questions to ask in the
 
01:10:16.709 --> 01:10:16.719 align:start position:0%
charlie or valerie
 
01:10:23.110 --> 01:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:27.189 --> 01:10:27.199 align:start position:0%
all right so then we'll hold this for a
 
01:10:30.870 --> 01:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
future work session we're not going to
 
01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:31.270 align:start position:0%
future work session we're not going to
have

01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
any work sessions until after next week
 
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
when we
 
01:10:38.790 --> 01:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
finish our regular session
 
01:10:46.149 --> 01:10:46.159 align:start position:0%
a third bill senate bill 103-fn
 
01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:48.520 align:start position:0%
relative to nexus provisions for certain
 
01:10:50.950 --> 01:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
disaster-related or emergency related
 
01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:51.350 align:start position:0%
disaster-related or emergency related
work

01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:11:01.750 --> 01:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
what are some of the questions that
 
01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
committee members have
 
01:11:16.229 --> 01:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:28.310 --> 01:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
has possible concerns and a
 
01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
perhaps a corrective amendment um
 
01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
that's what i've jotted down here
 
01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:52.830 --> 01:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:55.590 align:start position:0%
 
retinals

01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
retinals
 
01:11:59.590 --> 01:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
mr chair i know dra is on this call um
 
01:12:02.630 --> 01:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
and they i uh it has to do with the fact
 
01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
that this is a generic bill
 
01:12:08.310 --> 01:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
that uh every state's it's been moving
 
01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
around the states and about
 
01:12:11.350 --> 01:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
i don't know 30 i don't know what number
 
01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
about 30 the states have adopted this
 
01:12:15.510 --> 01:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
but since we have a unique tax structure
 
01:12:18.070 --> 01:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
that perhaps
 
01:12:20.149 --> 01:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
passing it as boilerplate when it comes
 
01:12:21.990 --> 01:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
to there's personal taxes
 
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
in here and things like that i think the
 
01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
ra would just want to address some of
 
01:12:25.199 --> 01:12:28.149 align:start position:0%
ra would just want to address some of
that

01:12:28.149 --> 01:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
and they are on the call i don't see
 
01:12:32.790 --> 01:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative major i already promoted
 
01:12:41.750 --> 01:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:46.709 --> 01:12:46.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:48.640 align:start position:0%
good afternoon representatives this is
 
01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
carolyn lear assistant commissioner
 
01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
at the new hampshire department of
 
01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:54.709 align:start position:0%
at the new hampshire department of
revenue

01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
01:12:54.719 --> 01:12:57.990 align:start position:0%
revenue
um

01:12:57.990 --> 01:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
we do we have um our fiscal impact
 
01:13:00.719 --> 01:13:01.510 align:start position:0%
we do we have um our fiscal impact
statement

01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
statement
 
01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
um as part of the bill package that you
 
01:13:08.110 --> 01:13:08.120 align:start position:0%
have i think that is pretty
 
01:13:11.189 --> 01:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
self-explanatory um
 
01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
what this field does is um
 
01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
create an exemption to
 
01:13:23.270 --> 01:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
nexus for a business that is in the
 
01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:23.750 align:start position:0%
nexus for a business that is in the
state

01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
to provide disaster related work
 
01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
the bill provides that they won't be
 
01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:30.709 align:start position:0%
the bill provides that they won't be
subject

01:13:30.709 --> 01:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
subject
 
01:13:33.669 --> 01:13:33.679 align:start position:0%
to any tax other than a transactional
 
01:13:33.679 --> 01:13:34.790 align:start position:0%
to any tax other than a transactional
tax

01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
tax
 
01:13:37.270 --> 01:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
um a transactional tax is something like
 
01:13:38.790 --> 01:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
a sales tax
 
01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
such as our meals and rentals tax they
 
01:13:43.270 --> 01:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
would still be subject to those sort of
 
01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
transactional taxes but would not be
 
01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
subject to business taxes and
 
01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
therefore our fiscal note does note
 
01:13:53.990 --> 01:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
um that there could be an indeterminable
 
01:13:56.709 --> 01:13:56.719 align:start position:0%
uh decrease in revenue because if those
 
01:13:57.750 --> 01:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
businesses are
 
01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
responding to disasters currently
 
01:14:03.990 --> 01:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
in the future those businesses would not
 
01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
be subject to tax
 
01:14:08.070 --> 01:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
and of course we have no real way to
 
01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
actually pinpoint
 
01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
the other thing i would know is that the
 
01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
exemption applies only
 
01:14:20.310 --> 01:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
to out-of-state businesses while in the
 
01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:21.189 align:start position:0%
to out-of-state businesses while in the
state

01:14:21.189 --> 01:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
um in-state businesses remain subject to
 
01:14:29.350 --> 01:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
the tax for providing the same services
 
01:14:30.870 --> 01:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
although it's probably above my
 
01:14:32.790 --> 01:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
expertise level to know whether that
 
01:14:35.669 --> 01:14:35.679 align:start position:0%
would be a permissible exemption or not
 
01:14:37.350 --> 01:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
but the one thing that i thought was a
 
01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
bit notable from
 
01:14:42.229 --> 01:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
the hearing and i didn't really clue on
 
01:14:44.070 --> 01:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
to this until after hearing some of the
 
01:14:46.149 --> 01:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
testimony on the bill
 
01:14:49.910 --> 01:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
is that this bill
 
01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
has sort of made the rounds in other
 
01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.189 align:start position:0%
has sort of made the rounds in other
states

01:14:53.189 --> 01:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:14:56.229 --> 01:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
and most other states
 
01:14:59.830 --> 01:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
have an income tax and so i think the
 
01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:00.550 align:start position:0%
have an income tax and so i think the
concern

01:15:00.550 --> 01:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
concern
 
01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
from an emergency response type business
 
01:15:06.149 --> 01:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
is that if they're going to send their
 
01:15:07.590 --> 01:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
new jersey employee
 
01:15:09.750 --> 01:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire for example there are
 
01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
01:15:14.390 --> 01:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
actual barriers related to
 
01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
registering with the um
 
01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
a different states department of revenue
 
01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
to withhold
 
01:15:24.149 --> 01:15:24.159 align:start position:0%
taxes for those employees and i
 
01:15:26.070 --> 01:15:26.080 align:start position:0%
understood the testimony of
 
01:15:29.189 --> 01:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
some of those in favor of this bill to
 
01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
really be surrounding
 
01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
withholding requirements in other states
 
01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
and managing that
 
01:15:39.590 --> 01:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
and i think that in and of itself isn't
 
01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
as much of an
 
01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
issue here in new hampshire where there
 
01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
is no income
 
01:15:47.990 --> 01:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
tax and no registration requirement with
 
01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
the department of revenue
 
01:15:52.149 --> 01:15:52.159 align:start position:0%
prior to coming into the state so i just
 
01:15:52.159 --> 01:15:53.110 align:start position:0%
prior to coming into the state so i just
wanted

01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
wanted
 
01:15:55.830 --> 01:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
um to share that with you that i do
 
01:15:56.550 --> 01:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
think it's
 
01:15:58.470 --> 01:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
slightly different in new hampshire
 
01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
because we do not have
 
01:16:04.149 --> 01:16:04.159 align:start position:0%
a personal income tax oh carolyn
 
01:16:07.669 --> 01:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
the bill as written do you see
 
01:16:10.950 --> 01:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
anything in it that you're concerned
 
01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:18.149 align:start position:0%
anything in it that you're concerned
about

01:16:18.149 --> 01:16:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:20.630 --> 01:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
um i i don't think that i did from an
 
01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:21.590 align:start position:0%
um i i don't think that i did from an
administrative

01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
perspective um no i think we could
 
01:16:28.229 --> 01:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
administer this bill um
 
01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
just fine um i think the question of
 
01:16:34.630 --> 01:16:34.640 align:start position:0%
whether the exemption
 
01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
is broad or narrow enough um
 
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
to exempt only the intended activity is
 
01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:41.189 align:start position:0%
to exempt only the intended activity is
really

01:16:41.189 --> 01:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:16:44.390 --> 01:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:50.470 --> 01:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:53.510 --> 01:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
01:16:56.550 --> 01:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
i don't see any so
 
01:16:58.790 --> 01:16:58.800 align:start position:0%

uh four bills that are going to be
debated

01:17:50.229 --> 01:17:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:51.910 --> 01:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
for a minute we were talking about
 
01:17:55.830 --> 01:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
earlier we done with all our bills now
 
01:17:58.950 --> 01:17:58.960 align:start position:0%

the four bills that we have to concern
 
01:18:19.510 --> 01:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
ourselves with cac are one and two
 
01:18:22.630 --> 01:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
and i want to talk to susan i i think
 
01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
we don't need to have a full-blown
 
01:18:31.270 --> 01:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
debate on this i think both sides are
 
01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
dug in they know how they're going to
 
01:18:34.870 --> 01:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
vote let's
 
01:18:37.590 --> 01:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
make our statements and get on and vote
 
01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:38.110 align:start position:0%
make our statements and get on and vote
on

01:18:38.110 --> 01:18:38.120 align:start position:0%

01:18:41.910 --> 01:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
cicr one and two but uh
 
01:18:45.189 --> 01:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
i'll discuss this with susan and see if
 
01:18:45.830 --> 01:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
there is
 
01:18:49.110 --> 01:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
we were intending just to do on
 
01:18:56.470 --> 01:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
one speaker each or one speaker each and
 
01:19:00.070 --> 01:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:03.430 --> 01:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
uh yes okay thank you
 
01:19:05.430 --> 01:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
we were willing to go just the pis but
 
01:19:06.709 --> 01:19:06.719 align:start position:0%
if you want to do one speaker each
 
01:19:08.630 --> 01:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
that's fine too
 
01:19:13.510 --> 01:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:16.950 --> 01:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
is found host bill 15
 
01:19:20.709 --> 01:19:20.719 align:start position:0%
which came out of our committee i
 
01:19:25.669 --> 01:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:28.709 --> 01:19:28.719 align:start position:0%
one republican and one democrat
 
01:19:32.070 --> 01:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
do you have anybody lined up to speak in
 
01:19:40.070 --> 01:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:43.110 --> 01:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
i told you on there was a
 
01:19:45.669 --> 01:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
extreme minority in each party that
 
01:19:45.679 --> 01:19:47.270 align:start position:0%
extreme minority in each party that
voted

01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
voted
 
01:19:50.310 --> 01:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
against the majority on this bill so
 
01:19:52.229 --> 01:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
it's up to the extreme minority to
 
01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
decide if they're
 
01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:57.830 align:start position:0%
decide if they're
talking

01:19:57.830 --> 01:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
we know if he's is he i guess
 
01:20:06.310 --> 01:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:09.830 --> 01:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
in opposition to house bill 15 on the
 
01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:15.669 align:start position:0%
in opposition to house bill 15 on the
floor

01:20:15.669 --> 01:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:17.510 --> 01:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
i guess my question is to you mr
 
01:20:19.270 --> 01:20:19.280 align:start position:0%

01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
let's go over to it i i put this
 
01:20:23.189 --> 01:20:23.199 align:start position:0%
question to everybody
 
01:20:25.910 --> 01:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
i haven't heard from anybody so i make
 
01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:26.629 align:start position:0%
i haven't heard from anybody so i make
these

01:20:26.629 --> 01:20:26.639 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:20:29.590 --> 01:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
mr speaker mr chairman yes i'm in the
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%

01:20:40.310 --> 01:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and i will do a pi sir
 
01:20:44.870 --> 01:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
all right thank you sir you are welcome
 
01:20:48.629 --> 01:20:48.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:51.750 --> 01:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:54.870 --> 01:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
that's the most contentious of all four
 
01:21:01.270 --> 01:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
which is house bill 626
 
01:21:03.510 --> 01:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
here we have to determine how many are
 
01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
going to speak in opposition
 
01:21:08.870 --> 01:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
and how many are going to speak
 
01:21:14.790 --> 01:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill and
 
01:21:18.790 --> 01:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea susan at this point
 
01:21:22.390 --> 01:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
i have no idea this is going to happen
 
01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
twice apparently um
 
01:21:27.669 --> 01:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
it's going to be debated on hope and i
 
01:21:29.350 --> 01:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
have to discuss it with the finance
 
01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
committee people
 
01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
and they're busy and we'll see
 
01:21:43.590 --> 01:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
how the finance does with hospital too
 
01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
but making the assumption that
 
01:21:54.149 --> 01:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:57.270 --> 01:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
then somebody will probably end up
 
01:22:01.030 --> 01:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
tabling it making a motion to table it
 
01:22:02.470 --> 01:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
when it comes up for debate on the
 
01:22:07.590 --> 01:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:10.149 --> 01:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
then we'll have to figure out what our
 
01:22:10.159 --> 01:22:10.950 align:start position:0%
then we'll have to figure out what our
strategy

01:22:10.950 --> 01:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
strategy
 
01:22:17.910 --> 01:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:27.910 --> 01:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:31.510 --> 01:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
cacr 1 and 2 is very clear
 
01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
we know what the outcome is going to be
 
01:22:42.629 --> 01:22:42.639 align:start position:0%
we also know it's terrible tax policy
 
01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
because it requires something of future
 
01:22:48.149 --> 01:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
legislatures for the next 120
 
01:22:53.910 --> 01:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:56.950 --> 01:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
you make a quick point
 
01:22:58.550 --> 01:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
imagine there's good points on both
 
01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:02.229 align:start position:0%
imagine there's good points on both
sides

01:23:02.229 --> 01:23:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
and i don't disagree with you i mean on
 
01:23:09.590 --> 01:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:14.550 --> 01:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:17.910 --> 01:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
all right then uh we'll see you tomorrow
 
01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:18.470 align:start position:0%
all right then uh we'll see you tomorrow
morning

01:23:18.470 --> 01:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:23:20.709 --> 01:23:20.719 align:start position:0%
at nine o'clock and this would be very
 
01:23:20.719 --> 01:23:21.669 align:start position:0%
at nine o'clock and this would be very
important

01:23:21.669 --> 01:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:23:23.830 --> 01:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
i would recommend looking through those
 
01:23:25.669 --> 01:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
slides tonight
 
01:23:33.030 --> 01:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:36.070 --> 01:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
i see no oh i i do see a hand
 
01:23:39.669 --> 01:23:39.679 align:start position:0%
from um representative heck and phillips
 
01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
mr chair i just wanted to notify you
 
01:23:43.910 --> 01:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
that my conflict for tomorrow was
 
01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:44.709 align:start position:0%
that my conflict for tomorrow was
resolved

01:23:44.709 --> 01:23:44.719 align:start position:0%
resolved

and i do anticipate being a participant
 
01:23:53.350 --> 01:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:57.030 --> 01:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
