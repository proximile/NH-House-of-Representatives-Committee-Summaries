bills uh then we will revert back and
 
00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
take the bills up we didn't accomplished
 
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
yesterday um the bills which we have
 
00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:51.880 align:start position:0%
here today just as a notice there's six
 
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:55.360 align:start position:0%
of them which are early bills and we
 
00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
will be taking action on those today we
 
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
have to so we can get those reports put
 
00:09:04.389 --> 00:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
together and get it all submitted by the
 
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
15th so those early bills and if you
 
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:10.040 align:start position:0%
have your sheet in front of you the
 
00:09:14.509 --> 00:09:14.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
1288 1305 is not an early Bill 1305
 
00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
that's the freedom of speech Association
 
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
that's not an early bill so we may not
 
00:09:27.509 --> 00:09:27.519 align:start position:0%
be doing that one today going to take
 
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:30.040 align:start position:0%
care of all the early bills which have
 
00:09:33.389 --> 00:09:33.399 align:start position:0%
those financial notes first
 
00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:36.200 align:start position:0%
1583 deals with the per pupil cost an
 
00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:38.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity for an adequate education
 
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
that's your base cause that yes we will
 
00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
be dealing that today 1586 establishing
 
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
a foundation opportunity budget yes we
 
00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
will be dealing with that today uh 1656
 
00:09:50.509 --> 00:09:50.519 align:start position:0%
adequacy for uh differentiate Aid
 
00:09:52.389 --> 00:09:52.399 align:start position:0%
special education yes we'll be dealing
 
00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:56.440 align:start position:0%
with 1656 today 1517 Rel to Statewide
 
00:09:59.150 --> 00:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
education property tax uh which deals
 
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
with the swep uh and gains a chance yes
 
00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:03.560 align:start position:0%
that is an early Bill we will be taking
 
00:10:05.949 --> 00:10:05.959 align:start position:0%
care of that today and relative to
 
00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:08.120 align:start position:0%
requiring excess revenues that yes
 
00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
that's also a SWAT Bill 1686 we will be
 
00:10:12.269 --> 00:10:12.279 align:start position:0%
dealing with that today and having to
 
00:10:14.269 --> 00:10:14.279 align:start position:0%
take action so you can see of those
 
00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
bills on the docker right there all but
 
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
one are early
 
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
bills so with that we're happy
 
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
Valentine's Day to everybody

and so what we're going to do is we're
 
00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:38.200 align:start position:0%
going to take a break for caucus now and
 
00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:40.120 align:start position:0%
let's take about you know up to a half
 
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
hour let's try not to go much farther
 
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
than that longer than
 
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
that we're going to be in the conference
 
00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
room right over here so we won't run it
 
00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
up and down yesterday we're looking for
 
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
these guys they're right there up and
 
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
down the hallway looking upstairs
 
00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
everywhere we came out several times
 
00:11:27.949 --> 00:11:27.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:27.959 --> 01:15:52.189 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:52.199 --> 01:16:41.189 align:start position:0%
 
no

01:16:41.189 --> 01:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:42.390 --> 01:16:42.400 align:start position:0%
okay the order in which we're going to
 
01:16:45.709 --> 01:16:45.719 align:start position:0%
take these bills up today are we're
 
01:16:47.430 --> 01:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
going to take them in sequential order
 
01:16:50.110 --> 01:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
starting with 1583 moving down the list
 
01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
and 1288 at the end we are not going to
 
01:16:58.350 --> 01:16:58.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:02.030 --> 01:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
today so the first bill uh that we'll be
 
01:17:04.510 --> 01:17:04.520 align:start position:0%
executing is HB
 
01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:07.440 align:start position:0%
1583 this is relative to the per pupil
 
01:17:09.310 --> 01:17:09.320 align:start position:0%
cost of an opportunity for an adquate
 
01:17:10.950 --> 01:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
education I'm going to hand the gavl
 
01:17:13.070 --> 01:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
over to represent
 
01:17:16.110 --> 01:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you Mr chairman um I

much I'd like to recommend OTP for 1583
 
01:17:28.070 --> 01:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
we'll second that second by
 
01:17:30.350 --> 01:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
representative luno uh discussion by the
 
01:17:34.350 --> 01:17:34.360 align:start position:0%
chair yes thank you very much um 14

1583 uh has an amendment so at this time
 
01:17:40.950 --> 01:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
I'd like to uh make a
 
01:17:44.790 --> 01:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
recommendation uh on uh the amendment
 
01:17:48.709 --> 01:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
for 1583 as ought to pass as amended and
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
that bill or amendment number is 0
 
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.510 align:start position:0%
that bill or amendment number is 0
6208

01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
6208
 
01:17:56.709 --> 01:17:56.719 align:start position:0%
H I'll second
 
01:17:59.990 --> 01:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
that discussion it you got
 
01:18:03.629 --> 01:18:03.639 align:start position:0%
it thank you very much Mr chair
 
01:18:06.030 --> 01:18:06.040 align:start position:0%
um this is
 
01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
a an amendment that
 
01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
replaces the
 
01:18:15.070 --> 01:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
bill with several components which are
 
01:18:17.070 --> 01:18:17.080 align:start position:0%
within the education funding formula
 
01:18:19.830 --> 01:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
currently uh or need to be in the
 
01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
education funding formula I'll look at
 
01:18:24.270 --> 01:18:24.280 align:start position:0%
the first part for let on line nine of
 
01:18:27.870 --> 01:18:27.880 align:start position:0%
the amendment and that just UPS the the
 
01:18:31.189 --> 01:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
base cost
 
01:18:34.910 --> 01:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
for uh the adequate education from the
 
01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:42.709 --> 01:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
$444 in looking at the formula which
 
01:18:46.030 --> 01:18:46.040 align:start position:0%
this was constructed from the which was
 
01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
developed back in
 
01:18:50.830 --> 01:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
2008 subsequently looked at during
 
01:18:53.629 --> 01:18:53.639 align:start position:0%
numerous studies specifically the
 
01:18:56.669 --> 01:18:56.679 align:start position:0%
201718 study the umberger
 
01:19:00.430 --> 01:19:00.440 align:start position:0%
study and later we have discussed
 
01:19:03.149 --> 01:19:03.159 align:start position:0%
costing in the the report that came out
 
01:19:06.669 --> 01:19:06.679 align:start position:0%
in 2020 the commission study what we
 
01:19:09.709 --> 01:19:09.719 align:start position:0%
recognize here is that the base cost
 
01:19:12.270 --> 01:19:12.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't reflect that we have right now
 
01:19:15.229 --> 01:19:15.239 align:start position:0%
the cost the average cost of a starting
 
01:19:17.790 --> 01:19:17.800 align:start position:0%
teacher within the education
 
01:19:20.669 --> 01:19:20.679 align:start position:0%
system and that we've done we've
 
01:19:22.470 --> 01:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
gathered information from the school
 
01:19:25.910 --> 01:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
district the the 2024 teacher minimum
 
01:19:27.750 --> 01:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
starting salary in public school
 
01:19:32.310 --> 01:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
districts and that that minimum starting
 
01:19:36.830 --> 01:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:39.229 --> 01:19:39.239 align:start position:0%
be get the proper sheet buried in
 
01:19:39.239 --> 01:19:43.790 align:start position:0%
be get the proper sheet buried in
paperwork

01:19:43.790 --> 01:19:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:45.310 align:start position:0%
 
here

01:19:45.310 --> 01:19:45.320 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:49.070 align:start position:0%
here
4,2

01:19:49.070 --> 01:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:51.709 --> 01:19:51.719 align:start position:0%
42,5 so that's where we started out with
 
01:19:54.590 --> 01:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
that base cost but also we've added in
 
01:19:57.910 --> 01:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
the 30% for benefit
 
01:20:01.709 --> 01:20:01.719 align:start position:0%
package and the 20% as has been in the
 
01:20:03.430 --> 01:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
previous for special
 
01:20:07.669 --> 01:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
teachers and so what we end up after we
 
01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
modified all the components within that
 
01:20:14.470 --> 01:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
formula bringing it up a to a level
 
01:20:16.870 --> 01:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
which it's approaching what those costs
 
01:20:19.350 --> 01:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
are today I'm not saying we're there but
 
01:20:21.189 --> 01:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
it's making a move in the right
 
01:20:24.430 --> 01:20:24.440 align:start position:0%
direction the the the universal cost
 
01:20:26.910 --> 01:20:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
$444 and what we've done is we've taken
 
01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
grade three and change that to be linked
 
01:20:34.910 --> 01:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
up with the pupil teacher ratio that's
 
01:20:36.750 --> 01:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
established for grades K through 2 which
 
01:20:40.189 --> 01:20:40.199 align:start position:0%
is 25-1 previously the pupil teacher
 
01:20:44.110 --> 01:20:44.120 align:start position:0%
ratio uh for grade three was 30 to1
 
01:20:46.870 --> 01:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
grades 3 through 12 so grade three has
 
01:20:49.750 --> 01:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
been joined in with the K through three
 
01:20:51.310 --> 01:20:51.320 align:start position:0%
and the intermediate grades and the
 
01:20:55.070 --> 01:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
middle school grades are are uh
 
01:20:58.350 --> 01:20:58.360 align:start position:0%
unchanged so that's the change there for
 
01:21:01.870 --> 01:21:01.880 align:start position:0%
for that portion of the of the bill
 
01:21:03.590 --> 01:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
there are other portions of the bill
 
01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
dealing with fiscal capacity
 
01:21:10.270 --> 01:21:10.280 align:start position:0%
support uh which we have taken the that
 
01:21:12.229 --> 01:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
concept of needing fiscal capacity
 
01:21:17.510 --> 01:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
disparity Aid uh from the 2008 study and
 
01:21:20.030 --> 01:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
we've also took it out of the
 
01:21:21.430 --> 01:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
recommendations that came out of the
 
01:21:25.350 --> 01:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
house with hb2 previous year and put
 
01:21:27.629 --> 01:21:27.639 align:start position:0%
that back in seeing that we don't want
 
01:21:29.709 --> 01:21:29.719 align:start position:0%
to touch just the left hand side of the
 
01:21:32.590 --> 01:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
column we want to touch the right hand
 
01:21:35.430 --> 01:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
side too which provides support to the
 
01:21:39.229 --> 01:21:39.239 align:start position:0%
communities which need that uh support
 
01:21:41.270 --> 01:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
to provide the opportunity for an
 
01:21:45.669 --> 01:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
adequate education it also uh has relief
 
01:21:49.310 --> 01:21:49.320 align:start position:0%
aid grant as well within that and we're
 
01:21:52.470 --> 01:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
not touching the hold harmless so that
 
01:21:54.990 --> 01:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
is is basically an overview a high level
 
01:21:58.790 --> 01:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
overview of this amendment and I would
 
01:22:00.590 --> 01:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
hope that we would pass this amendment
 
01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
and move it on to the proper committees
 
01:22:06.350 --> 01:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
where further discussion can be had
 
01:22:08.990 --> 01:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
either through Finance or in some of
 
01:22:10.669 --> 01:22:10.679 align:start position:0%

much uh discussion from anyone on the
 
01:22:54.750 --> 01:22:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:56.390 --> 01:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and good morning
 
01:22:57.790 --> 01:22:57.800 align:start position:0%
members of the
 
01:23:00.030 --> 01:23:00.040 align:start position:0%
committee while I do appreciate the work
 
01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
that the subcomittee subcommittee did on
 
01:23:04.189 --> 01:23:04.199 align:start position:0%
this bill and while I I certainly
 
01:23:05.550 --> 01:23:05.560 align:start position:0%
recognize with the inflationary
 
01:23:06.910 --> 01:23:06.920 align:start position:0%
environment we're in that there is a
 
01:23:08.590 --> 01:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
cost increase in
 
01:23:12.550 --> 01:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
items that said I can't help but look at
 
01:23:14.910 --> 01:23:14.920 align:start position:0%
spending overall that New Hampshire is
 
01:23:17.189 --> 01:23:17.199 align:start position:0%
not anywhere near the bottom end of
 
01:23:19.990 --> 01:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
spending on education in this country
 
01:23:21.750 --> 01:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
and that if you compare spending in this
 
01:23:23.590 --> 01:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
country to other Western Nations we seem
 
01:23:26.950 --> 01:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
to spend an awful lot more on things now
 
01:23:31.070 --> 01:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
I I can't help but notice that a our uh
 
01:23:33.590 --> 01:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
jobs that we have in education the rate
 
01:23:35.430 --> 01:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
at which administrative positions have
 
01:23:38.189 --> 01:23:38.199 align:start position:0%
expanded compared to teaching positions
 
01:23:40.510 --> 01:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
is major cause for concern for me and I
 
01:23:42.149 --> 01:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
think a lot of that has to do with the
 
01:23:43.830 --> 01:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
fact that we have an awful lot of jobs
 
01:23:45.669 --> 01:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
and other things that we do solely
 
01:23:47.310 --> 01:23:47.320 align:start position:0%
because they have become Federal
 
01:23:49.870 --> 01:23:49.880 align:start position:0%
requirements for us to do these things
 
01:23:52.510 --> 01:23:52.520 align:start position:0%
so what I see is an awful lot of room
 
01:23:54.470 --> 01:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
for us to be taking back control of our
 
01:23:56.189 --> 01:23:56.199 align:start position:0%
education as a state from the federal
 
01:23:58.189 --> 01:23:58.199 align:start position:0%
government and eliminating a lot of
 
01:24:00.149 --> 01:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
these costs that are only necessary for
 
01:24:01.709 --> 01:24:01.719 align:start position:0%
that reason I believe there was a lot of
 
01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
cost savings already to be found within
 
01:24:06.870 --> 01:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
our existing system and until we address
 
01:24:08.709 --> 01:24:08.719 align:start position:0%
that I cannot see reaching deeper into
 
01:24:11.709 --> 01:24:11.719 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer pocket to do something like
 
01:24:13.350 --> 01:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
this thank
 
01:24:17.149 --> 01:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
you further comments anyone um
 
01:24:17.159 --> 01:24:20.030 align:start position:0%
you further comments anyone um
representative

01:24:20.030 --> 01:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:22.510 --> 01:24:22.520 align:start position:0%
Damon I would like to say that I
 
01:24:25.470 --> 01:24:25.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate the efforts of the committee
 
01:24:29.590 --> 01:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
slask force in this really difficult
 
01:24:32.270 --> 01:24:32.280 align:start position:0%
project and I don't see this as spending
 
01:24:34.669 --> 01:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
more money on education I see it as the
 
01:24:38.470 --> 01:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
state working to make a more balanced
 
01:24:41.229 --> 01:24:41.239 align:start position:0%
system of Education funding across all
 
01:24:44.109 --> 01:24:44.119 align:start position:0%
our communities and I support
 
01:24:48.669 --> 01:24:48.679 align:start position:0%
it repr try thank you
 
01:24:52.709 --> 01:24:52.719 align:start position:0%
um so I voted against this
 
01:24:57.950 --> 01:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
recommendation in subcommittee because
 
01:25:02.990 --> 01:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
uh at the very end of the day a we added
 
01:25:06.510 --> 01:25:06.520 align:start position:0%
numbers to the fiscal capacity disparity
 
01:25:08.310 --> 01:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
which I supported and the special ed
 
01:25:11.070 --> 01:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
which I supported that was for uh free
 
01:25:14.550 --> 01:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
and reduced lunch and my mind had been
 
01:25:18.390 --> 01:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
set on 74 million and adding 25 million
 
01:25:20.990 --> 01:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
from free and reduced lunch put it up to
 
01:25:25.109 --> 01:25:25.119 align:start position:0%
me what I thought was um a big jump and
 
01:25:28.350 --> 01:25:28.360 align:start position:0%
I voted no because I wanted to discuss
 
01:25:31.109 --> 01:25:31.119 align:start position:0%
that before I made a vote on it and that
 
01:25:33.590 --> 01:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
was and so this is the opportunity to
 
01:25:36.310 --> 01:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
discuss it and I just wanted to know why
 
01:25:39.550 --> 01:25:39.560 align:start position:0%
that extra free and reduced Bunch 25
 
01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
million was added at the very
 
01:25:44.070 --> 01:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
end uh thank you further comments
 
01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
representative Pell thank you Mr chair
 
01:25:49.830 --> 01:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
um yes I will be supporting this as
 
01:25:51.870 --> 01:25:51.880 align:start position:0%
amended however I want to point out that
 
01:25:54.350 --> 01:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
we are discussing that our con
 
01:25:56.070 --> 01:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
discussing our constitutional duty of
 
01:25:58.870 --> 01:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
funding an adequate education pursuant
 
01:26:03.109 --> 01:26:03.119 align:start position:0%
to RSA 193 e2a however our local school
 
01:26:04.910 --> 01:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
district just released their five-year
 
01:26:07.830 --> 01:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
strategic plan and academics is listed
 
01:26:10.030 --> 01:26:10.040 align:start position:0%
fourth on the list of priorities out of
 
01:26:12.189 --> 01:26:12.199 align:start position:0%
a total of four so while I will be
 
01:26:14.310 --> 01:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
voting in favor the priorities that
 
01:26:15.669 --> 01:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
Governor Wentworth Regional School
 
01:26:17.430 --> 01:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
District Define demonstrate that we need
 
01:26:19.750 --> 01:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
to also hold our local school districts
 
01:26:22.270 --> 01:26:22.280 align:start position:0%
accountable to their constitutional Duty
 
01:26:25.510 --> 01:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:28.950 --> 01:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
education um thank you um further
 
01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
comments from anybody representative
 
01:26:35.950 --> 01:26:35.960 align:start position:0%
ladin yeah I'd like to add that the this
 
01:26:39.470 --> 01:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
bill has two effective dates within
 
01:26:43.270 --> 01:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
it the fiscal capacity disparity Aid and
 
01:26:45.470 --> 01:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
the enhanced free and reduced which
 
01:26:47.550 --> 01:26:47.560 align:start position:0%
totals 64
 
01:26:54.030 --> 01:26:54.040 align:start position:0%
million is to be instituted July 1 2024
 
01:26:59.390 --> 01:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:05.910 --> 01:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
$444 per pupil is due to increase July 1
 
01:27:08.709 --> 01:27:08.719 align:start position:0%
2025 and that's we're trying to move
 
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
into this and and do it
 
01:27:13.870 --> 01:27:13.880 align:start position:0%
carefully uh we are talking in terms of
 
01:27:16.830 --> 01:27:16.840 align:start position:0%
dollars here the the increase for the
 
01:27:19.629 --> 01:27:19.639 align:start position:0%
base cost is a little over $34
 
01:27:23.149 --> 01:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
million so if you add the the 64 and the
 
01:27:25.750 --> 01:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
$35 million
 
01:27:28.790 --> 01:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
together excuse me the 34 you can see
 
01:27:32.629 --> 01:27:32.639 align:start position:0%
that we're coming up close to 100 th100
 
01:27:36.990 --> 01:27:37.000 align:start position:0%
million um I believe that this is
 
01:27:40.109 --> 01:27:40.119 align:start position:0%
revenue that is needed in our districts
 
01:27:42.709 --> 01:27:42.719 align:start position:0%
to get us to a level where it's
 
01:27:45.990 --> 01:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
necessary to where we can find people to
 
01:27:49.870 --> 01:27:49.880 align:start position:0%
teach in education um it takes a an
 
01:27:52.189 --> 01:27:52.199 align:start position:0%
individual a lot of fortitude to come in
 
01:27:53.070 --> 01:27:53.080 align:start position:0%
and know that they're going to be
 
01:27:56.270 --> 01:27:56.280 align:start position:0%
starting out if in a salary that we what
 
01:27:58.709 --> 01:27:58.719 align:start position:0%
we're paying and some of the if you look
 
01:28:00.350 --> 01:28:00.360 align:start position:0%
at the starting salaries of some of
 
01:28:02.350 --> 01:28:02.360 align:start position:0%
those that are on the sheet to come in
 
01:28:04.229 --> 01:28:04.239 align:start position:0%
we're getting salaries still down in a
 
01:28:04.239 --> 01:28:05.750 align:start position:0%
we're getting salaries still down in a
30,000

01:28:05.750 --> 01:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
30,000
 
01:28:09.629 --> 01:28:09.639 align:start position:0%
range and that that is pretty Meer for a
 
01:28:12.149 --> 01:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
young family that has young children uh
 
01:28:14.350 --> 01:28:14.360 align:start position:0%
it means both have to be working and I
 
01:28:15.629 --> 01:28:15.639 align:start position:0%
understand that's part of a society
 
01:28:17.709 --> 01:28:17.719 align:start position:0%
today that really takes two adults in a
 
01:28:21.149 --> 01:28:21.159 align:start position:0%
family to make it work but I I also
 
01:28:24.149 --> 01:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
believe that it's necessary to have this
 
01:28:25.470 --> 01:28:25.480 align:start position:0%
money on the right hand side of the
 
01:28:28.030 --> 01:28:28.040 align:start position:0%
formula if you plug it all on the left
 
01:28:32.189 --> 01:28:32.199 align:start position:0%
hand side for the smaller District it
 
01:28:35.070 --> 01:28:35.080 align:start position:0%
may help some but it's not going to have
 
01:28:37.030 --> 01:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
the student population to really show
 
01:28:39.550 --> 01:28:39.560 align:start position:0%
that needed gain that they have and the
 
01:28:42.470 --> 01:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and the ability to uh
 
01:28:45.030 --> 01:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
have courses like AP within their their
 
01:28:47.350 --> 01:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
school but if we put it on the right
 
01:28:50.070 --> 01:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
hand side we're helping the property
 
01:28:52.030 --> 01:28:52.040 align:start position:0%
poor communities and those that have
 
01:28:55.070 --> 01:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
have issues in terms of they're capped
 
01:28:57.350 --> 01:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
out with Mill rates now which are over
 
01:28:58.950 --> 01:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
$30 per
 
01:29:02.030 --> 01:29:02.040 align:start position:0%
thousand some even higher than that if
 
01:29:04.390 --> 01:29:04.400 align:start position:0%
you take in the Local District the water
 
01:29:06.629 --> 01:29:06.639 align:start position:0%
district that and that add that in so
 
01:29:08.310 --> 01:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
there are some districts which are
 
01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
really tapping people out and can't
 
01:29:14.629 --> 01:29:14.639 align:start position:0%
there's nothing left so um and I I don't
 
01:29:16.870 --> 01:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
believe this money that we're providing
 
01:29:19.470 --> 01:29:19.480 align:start position:0%
in adequacy is being misused there may
 
01:29:21.229 --> 01:29:21.239 align:start position:0%
be some people thinking that well it's
 
01:29:23.149 --> 01:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
not the right price priority but that's
 
01:29:24.709 --> 01:29:24.719 align:start position:0%
a decision that's made by the local
 
01:29:27.070 --> 01:29:27.080 align:start position:0%
school board thank
 
01:29:31.669 --> 01:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
you um for the comments uh re cascaden
 
01:29:35.310 --> 01:29:35.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just wanted to add
 
01:29:37.590 --> 01:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
that this particular bill again doesn't
 
01:29:41.629 --> 01:29:41.639 align:start position:0%
quite meet the um the lawsuits that have
 
01:29:43.430 --> 01:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
occurred in the last three years because
 
01:29:46.070 --> 01:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
it doesn't fully fund adequacy however
 
01:29:49.229 --> 01:29:49.239 align:start position:0%
it moves the state in that direction and
 
01:29:50.709 --> 01:29:50.719 align:start position:0%
because from the numbers that I had
 
01:29:52.229 --> 01:29:52.239 align:start position:0%
gotten in the subcommittee that there
 
01:29:55.350 --> 01:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
was a balance of about 145 million in
 
01:29:56.990 --> 01:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
the education trust
 
01:30:01.910 --> 01:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
fund adding 99 million of that is very
 
01:30:05.070 --> 01:30:05.080 align:start position:0%
fiscally responsible in our roles with
 
01:30:08.310 --> 01:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
the state money as opposed to increasing
 
01:30:12.950 --> 01:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
an EFA to 500% with no dollar limits so
 
01:30:14.750 --> 01:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
I think we are being very fiscally
 
01:30:18.030 --> 01:30:18.040 align:start position:0%
responsible by identifying those
 
01:30:20.350 --> 01:30:20.360 align:start position:0%
categories uh that are very needed and
 
01:30:22.390 --> 01:30:22.400 align:start position:0%
it moves us in a Direction of fully
 
01:30:24.430 --> 01:30:24.440 align:start position:0%
funding and adequate education which is
 
01:30:24.440 --> 01:30:25.350 align:start position:0%
funding and adequate education which is
our

01:30:25.350 --> 01:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:30:27.390 --> 01:30:27.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility so I absolutely will
 
01:30:30.590 --> 01:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
support this and I think it was very uh
 
01:30:36.189 --> 01:30:36.199 align:start position:0%
well um played out so to speak I mean in
 
01:30:39.229 --> 01:30:39.239 align:start position:0%
2020 all of the data to support some of
 
01:30:41.550 --> 01:30:41.560 align:start position:0%
this work occurred during the school
 
01:30:44.510 --> 01:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
funding commission so we
 
01:30:48.510 --> 01:30:48.520 align:start position:0%
know sort of our communities we know the
 
01:30:50.750 --> 01:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
populations in our communities we know
 
01:30:53.109 --> 01:30:53.119 align:start position:0%
our kids we know how they they perform
 
01:30:55.390 --> 01:30:55.400 align:start position:0%
we know what equalized valuation of
 
01:30:58.629 --> 01:30:58.639 align:start position:0%
properties are and we could not be more
 
01:31:01.669 --> 01:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
fiscally responsible in funding public
 
01:31:03.310 --> 01:31:03.320 align:start position:0%
education in New Hampshire than moving
 
01:31:05.830 --> 01:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
this bill forward so I absolutely would
 
01:31:07.790 --> 01:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
support it I mean I've been fighting
 
01:31:09.750 --> 01:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
this fight since
 
01:31:12.950 --> 01:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
2015 um almost 10 years and other people
 
01:31:15.470 --> 01:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
have been fighting it for 30 years it
 
01:31:20.189 --> 01:31:20.199 align:start position:0%
really Mak sense thank you represent Lun
 
01:31:22.390 --> 01:31:22.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and
 
01:31:27.229 --> 01:31:27.239 align:start position:0%
um and I know representative lad U had U
 
01:31:32.709 --> 01:31:32.719 align:start position:0%
had had worked to um to craft this um
 
01:31:35.149 --> 01:31:35.159 align:start position:0%
the the language here in the amendment
 
01:31:38.990 --> 01:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
um and uh and I wanted to make sure that
 
01:31:43.550 --> 01:31:43.560 align:start position:0%
um that one of the intents behind the
 
01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:45.310 align:start position:0%
um that one of the intents behind the
amendment

01:31:45.310 --> 01:31:45.320 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:31:49.470 --> 01:31:49.480 align:start position:0%
uh didn't accidentally um drop out um
 
01:31:51.470 --> 01:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
and I think there was an intention that
 
01:31:53.830 --> 01:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
on on page two of the amendment on lines
 
01:31:57.830 --> 01:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
29 and 30 you can see how the the um
 
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
determination of theed total education
 
01:32:04.350 --> 01:32:04.360 align:start position:0%
grant includes the two um the two new
 
01:32:07.910 --> 01:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
components we talked about the the um
 
01:32:11.189 --> 01:32:11.199 align:start position:0%
the additional um the free and reduce um
 
01:32:13.910 --> 01:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
the the the um additional free and
 
01:32:15.510 --> 01:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
reduce price lunch
 
01:32:18.109 --> 01:32:18.119 align:start position:0%
Grant uh and the fiscal capacity
 
01:32:20.310 --> 01:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
disparity Grant so those are on lines 29
 
01:32:23.390 --> 01:32:23.400 align:start position:0%
and 30 and that those additional grants
 
01:32:27.189 --> 01:32:27.199 align:start position:0%
are not supposed to eat into any hold
 
01:32:30.030 --> 01:32:30.040 align:start position:0%
harmless that might be in place the hold
 
01:32:31.990 --> 01:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
hold harmless was put in place in the
 
01:32:34.070 --> 01:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
last budget as a result of the
 
01:32:35.910 --> 01:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
elimination of the stabilization the
 
01:32:37.430 --> 01:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
creation of the extraordinary needs
 
01:32:41.310 --> 01:32:41.320 align:start position:0%
Grant and those two over time um work
 
01:32:43.470 --> 01:32:43.480 align:start position:0%
against each other extraordinary needs
 
01:32:46.990 --> 01:32:47.000 align:start position:0%
increases and and the whole harmless
 
01:32:49.709 --> 01:32:49.719 align:start position:0%
decreases the the two grants we just
 
01:32:52.030 --> 01:32:52.040 align:start position:0%
talked about the enhanced free introduce
 
01:32:54.590 --> 01:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
lunch and the fiscal capacity disparity
 
01:32:56.709 --> 01:32:56.719 align:start position:0%
are not supposed to decrease the hold
 
01:32:59.910 --> 01:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
harmless but I'm concerned that um that
 
01:33:04.870 --> 01:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
in um Section 5 Roman 2 that um on lines
 
01:33:09.910 --> 01:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
34 and 35 it could be interpreted that
 
01:33:13.629 --> 01:33:13.639 align:start position:0%
um that that those two additional grants
 
01:33:16.550 --> 01:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
would eat into a hold harmless Grant I'm
 
01:33:20.910 --> 01:33:20.920 align:start position:0%
just um I I I I believe our our
 
01:33:23.709 --> 01:33:23.719 align:start position:0%
Collective tent was for it not to eat
 
01:33:26.830 --> 01:33:26.840 align:start position:0%
into the hold harmless yeah and if I may
 
01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:28.390 align:start position:0%
into the hold harmless yeah and if I may
yeah

01:33:28.390 --> 01:33:28.400 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:33:31.109 --> 01:33:31.119 align:start position:0%
um the page
 
01:33:33.229 --> 01:33:33.239 align:start position:0%
three with the
 
01:33:36.350 --> 01:33:36.360 align:start position:0%
2A uh does speak to hold harmless Grant
 
01:33:38.350 --> 01:33:38.360 align:start position:0%
and you're you're correct we we did not
 
01:33:42.030 --> 01:33:42.040 align:start position:0%
want to eat into that area of it so the
 
01:33:46.629 --> 01:33:46.639 align:start position:0%
intent ah thank you very much thank you
 
01:33:48.550 --> 01:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
it's there in the Bill thank you very
 
01:33:51.030 --> 01:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
much you're welcome uh further
 
01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:52.669 align:start position:0%
much you're welcome uh further
discussion

01:33:52.669 --> 01:33:52.679 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:33:55.950 --> 01:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:58.350 --> 01:33:58.360 align:start position:0%
Lakers I just wanted to pass on one
 
01:34:00.149 --> 01:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
piece of information when we're looking
 
01:34:03.030 --> 01:34:03.040 align:start position:0%
at what is in the
 
01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:07.390 align:start position:0%
at what is in the
um

01:34:07.390 --> 01:34:07.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:10.669 --> 01:34:10.679 align:start position:0%
education why does this always happen I
 
01:34:11.629 --> 01:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
think I
 
01:34:15.350 --> 01:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
get the education trust fund that
 
01:34:18.149 --> 01:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't show up every year it's taken
 
01:34:21.070 --> 01:34:21.080 align:start position:0%
like four years or more than that to get
 
01:34:24.070 --> 01:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
to that balance and if we spend that
 
01:34:26.310 --> 01:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
balance in one year we don't have a
 
01:34:29.790 --> 01:34:29.800 align:start position:0%
means of making it up and a ways and
 
01:34:32.790 --> 01:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
means was very concerned about that
 
01:34:35.750 --> 01:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
because they said we get 30 something I
 
01:34:37.669 --> 01:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
forget exactly the amount but it was
 
01:34:40.910 --> 01:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
less than 40 per
 
01:34:44.830 --> 01:34:44.840 align:start position:0%
year and we're talking about spending it
 
01:34:47.590 --> 01:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
all in one year and they were like how
 
01:34:49.629 --> 01:34:49.639 align:start position:0%
are we you know we don't have that money
 
01:34:52.109 --> 01:34:52.119 align:start position:0%
coming in how are we supposed to do that
 
01:34:54.189 --> 01:34:54.199 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about an ongoing
 
01:34:58.149 --> 01:34:58.159 align:start position:0%
expense every year how are we going to
 
01:35:00.430 --> 01:35:00.440 align:start position:0%
pay that expense when we don't actually
 
01:35:02.430 --> 01:35:02.440 align:start position:0%
have that money coming into the
 
01:35:05.189 --> 01:35:05.199 align:start position:0%
education trust fund every
 
01:35:09.270 --> 01:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
year um thank you I I do believe I might
 
01:35:10.950 --> 01:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
be mistaken someone could correct me if
 
01:35:13.629 --> 01:35:13.639 align:start position:0%
I am but I I think I have heard that
 
01:35:17.310 --> 01:35:17.320 align:start position:0%
based on um current um Revenue that
 
01:35:20.070 --> 01:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
there is uh projected to be um an even
 
01:35:22.830 --> 01:35:22.840 align:start position:0%
higher Surplus at the end of the next uh
 
01:35:28.310 --> 01:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:31.270 --> 01:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
fund that is
 
01:35:33.830 --> 01:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
correct any further
 
01:35:36.229 --> 01:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
discussion follow up followup
 
01:35:36.239 --> 01:35:39.149 align:start position:0%
discussion follow up followup
representative

01:35:39.149 --> 01:35:39.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:42.070 --> 01:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
lakus but is that because each year we
 
01:35:45.229 --> 01:35:45.239 align:start position:0%
add some to what we have now or is that
 
01:35:47.709 --> 01:35:47.719 align:start position:0%
because we are going to be getting
 
01:35:47.719 --> 01:35:49.109 align:start position:0%
because we are going to be getting
enough

01:35:49.109 --> 01:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
enough
 
01:35:51.910 --> 01:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
to completely
 
01:35:53.990 --> 01:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
cover all of this that's the question I
 
01:35:56.950 --> 01:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
mean even if we are just getting our 30
 
01:35:59.030 --> 01:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
or 40 each
 
01:36:02.790 --> 01:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
year that will give us a bigger excess
 
01:36:06.270 --> 01:36:06.280 align:start position:0%
but it won't give us an ongoing Supply
 
01:36:08.830 --> 01:36:08.840 align:start position:0%
so that's my
 
01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:10.510 align:start position:0%
so that's my
question

01:36:10.510 --> 01:36:10.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:36:14.830 --> 01:36:14.840 align:start position:0%
right it you we don't exhaust or
 
01:36:16.430 --> 01:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
hopefully don't exhaust the education
 
01:36:18.669 --> 01:36:18.679 align:start position:0%
trust fund and so you're right it's only
 
01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
new revenues coming in but it's built on
 
01:36:23.709 --> 01:36:23.719 align:start position:0%
the base that we have from the previous
 
01:36:27.669 --> 01:36:27.679 align:start position:0%
year in the education trust
 
01:36:31.189 --> 01:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
fund a representative lead and just as a
 
01:36:33.350 --> 01:36:33.360 align:start position:0%
followup because we've got into the
 
01:36:34.750 --> 01:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
education trust
 
01:36:38.070 --> 01:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
fund it's important that we do not drain
 
01:36:41.350 --> 01:36:41.360 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund we have so many
 
01:36:45.430 --> 01:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:48.310 --> 01:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
education my fear is if we drain that
 
01:36:50.430 --> 01:36:50.440 align:start position:0%
fund the money's going to go off in the
 
01:36:51.830 --> 01:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
other side of
 
01:36:55.189 --> 01:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
coin and who knows how that's going to
 
01:36:59.149 --> 01:36:59.159 align:start position:0%
be spent so uh I think we're prematur
 
01:37:00.750 --> 01:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
and even thinking at this time that we
 
01:37:02.870 --> 01:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
should be moving these monies out of
 
01:37:06.510 --> 01:37:06.520 align:start position:0%
this fund where I I I see my report
 
01:37:09.510 --> 01:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
right here projected estimated fiscal
 
01:37:13.470 --> 01:37:13.480 align:start position:0%
year 2025 where there'd be $222 million
 
01:37:16.270 --> 01:37:16.280 align:start position:0%
in that that fund uh I think it's wise
 
01:37:19.109 --> 01:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
that we keep there and use it
 
01:37:24.149 --> 01:37:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:26.310 --> 01:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
um I would just comment following on a
 
01:37:28.950 --> 01:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
few um
 
01:37:32.149 --> 01:37:32.159 align:start position:0%
and touching on representative Pell's
 
01:37:35.070 --> 01:37:35.080 align:start position:0%
comments about our local school district
 
01:37:37.590 --> 01:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
um I think that you know funding is one
 
01:37:40.870 --> 01:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
aspect of it but leadership is another
 
01:37:42.950 --> 01:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
um because without the proper leadership
 
01:37:45.030 --> 01:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get the results in
 
01:37:47.430 --> 01:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
the school that you want the culture the
 
01:37:51.550 --> 01:37:51.560 align:start position:0%
academics everything else um and uh to
 
01:37:55.310 --> 01:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
see that our school district has um
 
01:37:57.790 --> 01:37:57.800 align:start position:0%
declined in the past two years in terms
 
01:38:00.109 --> 01:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
of uh Ela
 
01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
proficiency um but yet they're not going
 
01:38:05.470 --> 01:38:05.480 align:start position:0%
to address that until the 27 28th school
 
01:38:09.550 --> 01:38:09.560 align:start position:0%
year is is troubling um so I I think
 
01:38:14.070 --> 01:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
that we can't look just at funding in
 
01:38:15.950 --> 01:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
order to improve education in New
 
01:38:18.149 --> 01:38:18.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but um there are many other
 
01:38:21.830 --> 01:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
factors as um has been touched on
 
01:38:24.830 --> 01:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:27.709 --> 01:38:27.719 align:start position:0%

01:45:24.910 --> 01:45:24.920 align:start position:0%
the revenue come from uh how does this
 
01:45:26.910 --> 01:45:26.920 align:start position:0%
integrate with the finance structure
 
01:45:30.390 --> 01:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
that we have given uh the adequacy
 
01:45:32.629 --> 01:45:32.639 align:start position:0%
formula and I'd like to thank those
 
01:45:34.350 --> 01:45:34.360 align:start position:0%
people that were on that all the folks
 
01:45:35.750 --> 01:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
that were on that committee we had two
 
01:45:38.470 --> 01:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
from Finance two from Ways and Means and
 
01:45:41.030 --> 01:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
and we had six from the the policy
 
01:45:43.910 --> 01:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
committee right here this bill this
 
01:45:46.990 --> 01:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
amendment addresses the issue that has
 
01:45:49.709 --> 01:45:49.719 align:start position:0%
come and surfaced in during numerous
 
01:45:49.719 --> 01:45:51.070 align:start position:0%
come and surfaced in during numerous
studies

01:45:51.070 --> 01:45:51.080 align:start position:0%
studies
 
01:45:54.790 --> 01:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
that we've had regarding the uh adequacy
 
01:45:56.669 --> 01:45:56.679 align:start position:0%
portion of our budget that is the
 
01:45:58.910 --> 01:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
leftand side base cost and the
 
01:46:01.030 --> 01:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
differentiate Aid
 
01:46:02.910 --> 01:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
components when we're talking about
 
01:46:05.229 --> 01:46:05.239 align:start position:0%
special education here we're not talking
 
01:46:07.229 --> 01:46:07.239 align:start position:0%
about the area of special education
 
01:46:09.750 --> 01:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
which is addressing catastrophic Aid or
 
01:46:12.149 --> 01:46:12.159 align:start position:0%
as we call it special education today
 
01:46:14.669 --> 01:46:14.679 align:start position:0%
that's a different pot of money and a
 
01:46:17.830 --> 01:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
different very difficult issue which
 
01:46:21.070 --> 01:46:21.080 align:start position:0%
must be resolved as well what we've done
 
01:46:23.350 --> 01:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
with the differentiated Aid component
 
01:46:28.669 --> 01:46:28.679 align:start position:0%
however is we've taken the the uh
 
01:46:30.470 --> 01:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
differentiate aid for special education
 
01:46:32.950 --> 01:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
and looked at these 13 different IEP
 
01:46:35.589 --> 01:46:35.599 align:start position:0%
categories that we have there and we've
 
01:46:37.669 --> 01:46:37.679 align:start position:0%
looked at the special education
 
01:46:40.709 --> 01:46:40.719 align:start position:0%
services and support needed for
 
01:46:43.430 --> 01:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
delivering these uh different uh areas
 
01:46:46.109 --> 01:46:46.119 align:start position:0%
of special education and in working with
 
01:46:49.030 --> 01:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education we were able
 
01:46:51.669 --> 01:46:51.679 align:start position:0%
to better understand how we might weight
 
01:46:55.430 --> 01:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
out uh by giving a weighted value to the
 
01:46:57.629 --> 01:46:57.639 align:start position:0%
uh to the category in which a student
 
01:47:00.229 --> 01:47:00.239 align:start position:0%
may fit into we're talking over 30,000
 
01:47:03.109 --> 01:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
students here in this state which
 
01:47:06.709 --> 01:47:06.719 align:start position:0%
receive special education support and I
 
01:47:09.070 --> 01:47:09.080 align:start position:0%
I we we got specifically the number of
 
01:47:11.149 --> 01:47:11.159 align:start position:0%
students that entails in each of the
 
01:47:13.149 --> 01:47:13.159 align:start position:0%
categories we identified three different
 
01:47:16.070 --> 01:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
categories of special education to wait
 
01:47:19.830 --> 01:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
out those categories involve let me get
 
01:47:27.550 --> 01:47:27.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:31.430 --> 01:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
here and are based on the amount of time
 
01:47:33.470 --> 01:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
that a student is working with during
 
01:47:37.310 --> 01:47:37.320 align:start position:0%
the day a a and receiving Services
 
01:47:39.629 --> 01:47:39.639 align:start position:0%
directly associated with special
 
01:47:42.550 --> 01:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
education the differentiated Aid so we
 
01:47:45.270 --> 01:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
we've identified three categories
 
01:47:50.030 --> 01:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
category a b and c category a is those
 
01:47:51.910 --> 01:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
student students which are inside the
 
01:47:55.910 --> 01:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
riger class 80% or more of the day and
 
01:47:59.229 --> 01:47:59.239 align:start position:0%
so they're inside the riger class 80% or
 
01:48:00.830 --> 01:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
more of the day that means those are the
 
01:48:03.550 --> 01:48:03.560 align:start position:0%
students that really receive less
 
01:48:05.149 --> 01:48:05.159 align:start position:0%
service than the student that's let's
 
01:48:06.990 --> 01:48:07.000 align:start position:0%
say in a residential placement or
 
01:48:10.350 --> 01:48:10.360 align:start position:0%
receiving uh services for a good part of
 
01:48:13.629 --> 01:48:13.639 align:start position:0%
the day so is the feeling of the
 
01:48:15.790 --> 01:48:15.800 align:start position:0%
committee I'm looking for my weighted
 
01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:18.430 align:start position:0%
committee I'm looking for my weighted
sheet

01:48:18.430 --> 01:48:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:21.109 --> 01:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
here I have those weights if you want
 
01:48:23.790 --> 01:48:23.800 align:start position:0%
okay I I I believe it started with like
 
01:48:28.109 --> 01:48:28.119 align:start position:0%
6 1.2 1.8 yeah correct of the base cost
 
01:48:30.390 --> 01:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
and what we're trying to do is recognize
 
01:48:33.350 --> 01:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
that the one shoe fits all right now
 
01:48:35.709 --> 01:48:35.719 align:start position:0%
formula which we have we have one amount
 
01:48:37.470 --> 01:48:37.480 align:start position:0%
of money which is allocated for
 
01:48:40.629 --> 01:48:40.639 align:start position:0%
differentiated for all that's not
 
01:48:44.310 --> 01:48:44.320 align:start position:0%
adequately meeting the needs of our our
 
01:48:46.510 --> 01:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
special ed department and and those kids
 
01:48:48.870 --> 01:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
needing these services so we we've
 
01:48:53.390 --> 01:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
waited out the first level at one at a 6
 
01:48:59.790 --> 01:48:59.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:03.229 --> 01:49:03.239 align:start position:0%
$4,044 and we waited out category B and
 
01:49:05.910 --> 01:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
there's two categories within B and this
 
01:49:09.229 --> 01:49:09.239 align:start position:0%
is a result of how our information is
 
01:49:12.470 --> 01:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
reported uh to the federal government
 
01:49:14.589 --> 01:49:14.599 align:start position:0%
and the Bureau of support special
 
01:49:16.390 --> 01:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
education support at the Department of
 
01:49:19.070 --> 01:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
Education has a data fact sheet here I'm
 
01:49:22.830 --> 01:49:22.840 align:start position:0%
looking at it it's developed around idea
 
01:49:25.270 --> 01:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
the individual disability educations act
 
01:49:27.910 --> 01:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
Part B indicator five and it talks about
 
01:49:30.390 --> 01:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
the education environments how we
 
01:49:33.310 --> 01:49:33.320 align:start position:0%
approach supporting these students and
 
01:49:35.030 --> 01:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
they have three categories as I
 
01:49:38.990 --> 01:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned a b c and and and and d a b
 
01:49:41.629 --> 01:49:41.639 align:start position:0%
and c b is broken down into two
 
01:49:43.629 --> 01:49:43.639 align:start position:0%
categories uh within the federal
 
01:49:46.149 --> 01:49:46.159 align:start position:0%
reporting inside regular class less than
 
01:49:49.350 --> 01:49:49.360 align:start position:0%
40% of the day and inside the regular
 
01:49:52.310 --> 01:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
class 40% % through 79% of the day so
 
01:49:54.430 --> 01:49:54.440 align:start position:0%
basically what it is it's all those
 
01:49:58.470 --> 01:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
students receiving 79% on down uh are in
 
01:50:02.910 --> 01:50:02.920 align:start position:0%
category B and and then category C is
 
01:50:05.229 --> 01:50:05.239 align:start position:0%
the category where we have homebound
 
01:50:07.550 --> 01:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
students those which are which are being
 
01:50:10.310 --> 01:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
Hospital in hospitals those that are in
 
01:50:12.589 --> 01:50:12.599 align:start position:0%
residential placements those are often
 
01:50:15.189 --> 01:50:15.199 align:start position:0%
times boarding students and we have
 
01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
those that are in um separate schooling
 
01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:20.990 align:start position:0%
those that are in um separate schooling
situations

01:50:20.990 --> 01:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
situations
 
01:50:23.470 --> 01:50:23.480 align:start position:0%
and and so
 
01:50:28.030 --> 01:50:28.040 align:start position:0%
um so the the way it it shakes out is
 
01:50:31.390 --> 01:50:31.400 align:start position:0%
that I'm looking for my master sheet
 
01:50:35.149 --> 01:50:35.159 align:start position:0%
here which is of course
 
01:50:38.550 --> 01:50:38.560 align:start position:0%
buried okay in category
 
01:50:42.350 --> 01:50:42.360 align:start position:0%
a we have projected for
 
01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:44.430 align:start position:0%
a we have projected for
fy2

01:50:44.430 --> 01:50:44.440 align:start position:0%
fy2
 
01:50:48.629 --> 01:50:48.639 align:start position:0%
24153 students in category B we have
 
01:50:51.950 --> 01:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
6,193 students students in category C
 
01:50:54.790 --> 01:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
619 students for a total of
 
01:50:56.910 --> 01:50:56.920 align:start position:0%
3,965 students that would special
 
01:50:59.629 --> 01:50:59.639 align:start position:0%
education IEP no I don't know yeah but I
 
01:51:02.709 --> 01:51:02.719 align:start position:0%
don't the the cost of providing this
 
01:51:08.550 --> 01:51:08.560 align:start position:0%
program um will increase by
 
01:51:12.390 --> 01:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
35122 or million so approximately $35
 
01:51:15.270 --> 01:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
million increases the cost of the to do
 
01:51:17.750 --> 01:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
this and we think feel it's very
 
01:51:20.669 --> 01:51:20.679 align:start position:0%
appropriate that we be doing this to
 
01:51:24.270 --> 01:51:24.280 align:start position:0%
support the needs uh of these students
 
01:51:26.589 --> 01:51:26.599 align:start position:0%
um and also to to support the local
 
01:51:28.430 --> 01:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
school districts local school districts
 
01:51:31.310 --> 01:51:31.320 align:start position:0%
now if they're receiving $2,000
 
01:51:35.629 --> 01:51:35.639 align:start position:0%
$2,300 approximately for um special
 
01:51:38.069 --> 01:51:38.079 align:start position:0%
education we are really asking the
 
01:51:40.950 --> 01:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
school district to pick up a huge burden
 
01:51:42.470 --> 01:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
especially when you start adding in
 
01:51:45.270 --> 01:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid and when the the
 
01:51:47.430 --> 01:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid doesn't get reimbursed
 
01:51:49.030 --> 01:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
or start to be reimbursed until after
 
01:51:50.990 --> 01:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
three and a half times the cost of
 
01:51:52.709 --> 01:51:52.719 align:start position:0%
educating student that means the local
 
01:51:54.310 --> 01:51:54.320 align:start position:0%
district has to cough up
 
01:51:56.470 --> 01:51:56.480 align:start position:0%
$70,000 before they even start to
 
01:51:58.510 --> 01:51:58.520 align:start position:0%
receive catastrophic or special
 
01:52:00.910 --> 01:52:00.920 align:start position:0%
education Aid this is a huge burden and
 
01:52:02.750 --> 01:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
we have to do something to offset these
 
01:52:05.629 --> 01:52:05.639 align:start position:0%
costs for locals um they're at the point
 
01:52:09.069 --> 01:52:09.079 align:start position:0%
where um it's not sustainable and we
 
01:52:11.149 --> 01:52:11.159 align:start position:0%
have an increasing population within
 
01:52:13.470 --> 01:52:13.480 align:start position:0%
special education so this bill does
 
01:52:16.189 --> 01:52:16.199 align:start position:0%
address this it's a good move
 
01:52:19.069 --> 01:52:19.079 align:start position:0%
forward uh especially by integrating the
 
01:52:21.790 --> 01:52:21.800 align:start position:0%
concept of we ated values for different
 
01:52:25.350 --> 01:52:25.360 align:start position:0%
levels of IEP this is being done in
 
01:52:27.069 --> 01:52:27.079 align:start position:0%
multiple States throughout the country
 
01:52:29.550 --> 01:52:29.560 align:start position:0%
today rather than just having one weight
 
01:52:31.870 --> 01:52:31.880 align:start position:0%
multiplying that you know you know as a
 
01:52:34.430 --> 01:52:34.440 align:start position:0%
portion of the base cost um isn't
 
01:52:36.870 --> 01:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
satisfactory and we are in a minority of
 
01:52:40.229 --> 01:52:40.239 align:start position:0%
States right now and so uh I I'd like to
 
01:52:42.270 --> 01:52:42.280 align:start position:0%
recommend that we move forward with this
 
01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
amendment I apologize for taking so much
 
01:52:48.430 --> 01:52:48.440 align:start position:0%
time um any further comment from the
 
01:52:51.750 --> 01:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
second no pleas com
 
01:52:55.709 --> 01:52:55.719 align:start position:0%
uh representative lakus I see your
 
01:52:59.270 --> 01:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
hand my comment is really just a I guess
 
01:53:02.430 --> 01:53:02.440 align:start position:0%
a grammar thing to me the way it's
 
01:53:04.550 --> 01:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
written and I kept reading it to try to
 
01:53:07.990 --> 01:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
figure out what it was actually saying
 
01:53:11.149 --> 01:53:11.159 align:start position:0%
given the percentages that were here it
 
01:53:13.669 --> 01:53:13.679 align:start position:0%
looks like to me it's saying that the
 
01:53:16.910 --> 01:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
pupils are receiving special education
 
01:53:20.510 --> 01:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
services inside regular class 80% or
 
01:53:24.550 --> 01:53:24.560 align:start position:0%
more of the day as opposed to the pupils
 
01:53:28.589 --> 01:53:28.599 align:start position:0%
who are receiving special education are
 
01:53:31.069 --> 01:53:31.079 align:start position:0%
inside regular classes 80% or more of
 
01:53:34.270 --> 01:53:34.280 align:start position:0%
the day so it actually looks like
 
01:53:37.149 --> 01:53:37.159 align:start position:0%
they're getting more special services in
 
01:53:40.990 --> 01:53:41.000 align:start position:0%
a than in B just because of the way it's
 
01:53:43.950 --> 01:53:43.960 align:start position:0%
worded it and I'm not
 
01:53:47.189 --> 01:53:47.199 align:start position:0%
sure how to fix it but it looks like
 
01:53:49.910 --> 01:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
they're receiving special education
 
01:53:53.109 --> 01:53:53.119 align:start position:0%
Services 80% or more of the
 
01:53:56.270 --> 01:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
day and and that it's in regular classes
 
01:53:59.069 --> 01:53:59.079 align:start position:0%
and so can I respond to that I don't
 
01:54:02.350 --> 01:54:02.360 align:start position:0%
know that's I'll respond to that when we
 
01:54:04.629 --> 01:54:04.639 align:start position:0%
worked with the director At
 
01:54:09.790 --> 01:54:09.800 align:start position:0%
Doe uh Miss Bret um this was discussed
 
01:54:12.910 --> 01:54:12.920 align:start position:0%
and the reporting formula which is sent
 
01:54:14.350 --> 01:54:14.360 align:start position:0%
out to school
 
01:54:17.390 --> 01:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
districts and I have the table here
 
01:54:20.109 --> 01:54:20.119 align:start position:0%
which they receive back it says
 
01:54:23.510 --> 01:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
specifically category B is broken into
 
01:54:25.910 --> 01:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
two categories for reporting I think she
 
01:54:27.629 --> 01:54:27.639 align:start position:0%
was talking about category a and
 
01:54:30.750 --> 01:54:30.760 align:start position:0%
category a is specifically written
 
01:54:33.910 --> 01:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
inside the riger class 80% or more of
 
01:54:36.990 --> 01:54:37.000 align:start position:0%
day and that's for ages 5 through
 
01:54:39.910 --> 01:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
21 um that's where the majority of the
 
01:54:41.629 --> 01:54:41.639 align:start position:0%
kids are
 
01:54:44.550 --> 01:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
so I guess that you know we're trying to
 
01:54:47.550 --> 01:54:47.560 align:start position:0%
reflect the language which is being used
 
01:54:51.510 --> 01:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
right now in accordance with the the
 
01:54:54.270 --> 01:54:54.280 align:start position:0%
procedures at the
 
01:54:57.390 --> 01:54:57.400 align:start position:0%
department represent follow up please
 
01:55:00.149 --> 01:55:00.159 align:start position:0%
yes I get that that's that they're
 
01:55:02.390 --> 01:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
inside regular class 80% or more of the
 
01:55:04.109 --> 01:55:04.119 align:start position:0%
day but the way it's worded it seems
 
01:55:06.310 --> 01:55:06.320 align:start position:0%
like they're getting their educa they're
 
01:55:09.030 --> 01:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
getting special education
 
01:55:11.830 --> 01:55:11.840 align:start position:0%
services inside that regular class 80%
 
01:55:13.430 --> 01:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
or more of the day and they're not I
 
01:55:15.709 --> 01:55:15.719 align:start position:0%
mean some of them are just being pulled
 
01:55:17.589 --> 01:55:17.599 align:start position:0%
out sometimes they're not getting their
 
01:55:21.270 --> 01:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
services inside all it just it's just a
 
01:55:23.589 --> 01:55:23.599 align:start position:0%
grammar issue it's not a what are we
 
01:55:27.350 --> 01:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:29.629 --> 01:55:29.639 align:start position:0%
reads differently I think than what
 
01:55:32.709 --> 01:55:32.719 align:start position:0%
you're I would concur with you um there
 
01:55:35.229 --> 01:55:35.239 align:start position:0%
there it's something though that this
 
01:55:36.550 --> 01:55:36.560 align:start position:0%
has to be worked out now you got to
 
01:55:38.709 --> 01:55:38.719 align:start position:0%
remember the subcommittee had what a
 
01:55:43.510 --> 01:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
couple weeks to really get on this and
 
01:55:45.830 --> 01:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
we are using language which was provided
 
01:55:48.750 --> 01:55:48.760 align:start position:0%
to us by the department in conjunction
 
01:55:50.270 --> 01:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
with the Federal Form which they have
 
01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:52.629 align:start position:0%
with the Federal Form which they have
for

01:55:52.629 --> 01:55:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:55.750 --> 01:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
idea I think we're all on the same page
 
01:55:59.270 --> 01:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
in terms of how to interpret this it
 
01:56:02.030 --> 01:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
will be going to another committee
 
01:56:05.550 --> 01:56:05.560 align:start position:0%
obviously so that may be something which
 
01:56:07.470 --> 01:56:07.480 align:start position:0%
we want to clarify there I think trying
 
01:56:10.510 --> 01:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
to do it today at this committee knowing
 
01:56:13.310 --> 01:56:13.320 align:start position:0%
that this has to be out of here just to
 
01:56:14.870 --> 01:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
the intent is
 
01:56:17.709 --> 01:56:17.719 align:start position:0%
there um represent D did you have your
 
01:56:17.719 --> 01:56:18.510 align:start position:0%
there um represent D did you have your
hand

01:56:18.510 --> 01:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
hand
 
01:56:21.350 --> 01:56:21.360 align:start position:0%
up okay representa
 
01:56:25.189 --> 01:56:25.199 align:start position:0%
Heath thank you Mr chair um I just want
 
01:56:28.109 --> 01:56:28.119 align:start position:0%
to say thank you um I think this is
 
01:56:30.629 --> 01:56:30.639 align:start position:0%
sending a signal to our local school
 
01:56:33.709 --> 01:56:33.719 align:start position:0%
districts that have been spending uh an
 
01:56:37.510 --> 01:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
excess of 800 million dollars a year on
 
01:56:40.669 --> 01:56:40.679 align:start position:0%
special education services I think it it
 
01:56:42.709 --> 01:56:42.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't solve all the issue because I
 
01:56:44.510 --> 01:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
think we have some federal issues that
 
01:56:46.589 --> 01:56:46.599 align:start position:0%
we need to take care of as well but I
 
01:56:49.510 --> 01:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
think it's a beginning and and it sends
 
01:56:52.790 --> 01:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
a real strong message to our local
 
01:56:55.229 --> 01:56:55.239 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that we're listening and we're
 
01:56:57.030 --> 01:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
trying to make a difference thank you
 
01:56:57.040 --> 01:56:58.109 align:start position:0%
trying to make a difference thank you
very

01:56:58.109 --> 01:56:58.119 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:57:00.470 --> 01:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
much represent
 
01:57:02.669 --> 01:57:02.679 align:start position:0%
cordello thank you um I have just a
 
01:57:05.430 --> 01:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
really quick uh solution after a
 
01:57:07.510 --> 01:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
services on line 15 have a comma and
 
01:57:09.629 --> 01:57:09.639 align:start position:0%
then the words who are P's receiving
 
01:57:11.870 --> 01:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
special education services comma who are
 
01:57:13.589 --> 01:57:13.599 align:start position:0%
inside regular class I don't know if it
 
01:57:14.709 --> 01:57:14.719 align:start position:0%
was appropriate to say now but I
 
01:57:16.069 --> 01:57:16.079 align:start position:0%
couldn't help
 
01:57:18.990 --> 01:57:19.000 align:start position:0%
myself good job the librarian uh
 
01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:20.830 align:start position:0%
myself good job the librarian uh
represent

01:57:20.830 --> 01:57:20.840 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:57:23.790 --> 01:57:23.800 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr chair and uh thank
 
01:57:25.270 --> 01:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
you for the committee uh subcommittee
 
01:57:27.270 --> 01:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
for working on this I very much
 
01:57:28.830 --> 01:57:28.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate the intent and I certainly
 
01:57:30.430 --> 01:57:30.440 align:start position:0%
recognize that we have a very real
 
01:57:33.550 --> 01:57:33.560 align:start position:0%
problem with issues with funding
 
01:57:35.189 --> 01:57:35.199 align:start position:0%
especially some of the more catastrophic
 
01:57:38.069 --> 01:57:38.079 align:start position:0%
instances of of disability at the Town
 
01:57:40.109 --> 01:57:40.119 align:start position:0%
level I think what we really need to be
 
01:57:42.189 --> 01:57:42.199 align:start position:0%
doing is figuring out how do we get the
 
01:57:45.589 --> 01:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
state to fully backtop these localities
 
01:57:47.910 --> 01:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
when it comes to these catastrophic
 
01:57:51.510 --> 01:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
cases but we need to do that with that
 
01:57:54.709 --> 01:57:54.719 align:start position:0%
with 100% making sure we do not create
 
01:57:56.550 --> 01:57:56.560 align:start position:0%
any perverse incentive toward the
 
01:57:59.669 --> 01:57:59.679 align:start position:0%
proliferation of IEPs in
 
01:58:02.470 --> 01:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
general uh the the other thing I want to
 
01:58:05.870 --> 01:58:05.880 align:start position:0%
speak to on this um is that we've heard
 
01:58:09.350 --> 01:58:09.360 align:start position:0%
testimony that as of right now money in
 
01:58:13.189 --> 01:58:13.199 align:start position:0%
the special education fund is not just
 
01:58:15.910 --> 01:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
being used for students with special
 
01:58:18.430 --> 01:58:18.440 align:start position:0%
education needs we've heard that there
 
01:58:21.510 --> 01:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
is money from this program flowing to
 
01:58:24.270 --> 01:58:24.280 align:start position:0%
mtssb which is a divisive program that
 
01:58:26.830 --> 01:58:26.840 align:start position:0%
therapeuti all students not just those
 
01:58:29.270 --> 01:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
who have been identified with a need for
 
01:58:32.189 --> 01:58:32.199 align:start position:0%
it so as of right now I can't support
 
01:58:35.310 --> 01:58:35.320 align:start position:0%
across the board increases until we
 
01:58:38.510 --> 01:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
actually make sure that this fund is not
 
01:58:40.109 --> 01:58:40.119 align:start position:0%
being turned into a slush fund that it's
 
01:58:43.109 --> 01:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
being used exclusively for students with
 
01:58:45.350 --> 01:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
disabilities cuz as of right now I can't
 
01:58:46.910 --> 01:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
honestly say that if we put this in the
 
01:58:48.870 --> 01:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
law how much if any of this is going to
 
01:58:50.430 --> 01:58:50.440 align:start position:0%
be used for students with disabilities
 
01:58:53.109 --> 01:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
versus being shifted to the mtssb
 
01:58:55.149 --> 01:58:55.159 align:start position:0%
program I think you might be referring
 
01:58:57.109 --> 01:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
to another piece of legislation that
 
01:58:58.910 --> 01:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
we've we've discussed in terms of
 
01:59:00.910 --> 01:59:00.920 align:start position:0%
special ed uh
 
01:59:03.589 --> 01:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
funds and not necessarily this bill
 
01:59:05.189 --> 01:59:05.199 align:start position:0%
representative Draymond
 
01:59:08.109 --> 01:59:08.119 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair I just want to
 
01:59:10.550 --> 01:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
clarify from my
 
01:59:13.430 --> 01:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
understanding that the I believe the
 
01:59:16.510 --> 01:59:16.520 align:start position:0%
number um Mr lad representative lad
 
01:59:19.310 --> 01:59:19.320 align:start position:0%
quoted was 35 million that is enough to
 
01:59:22.310 --> 01:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
fund what this amendment proposes to do
 
01:59:24.390 --> 01:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
with no Pro
 
01:59:27.510 --> 01:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
rating yes thank
 
01:59:30.830 --> 01:59:30.840 align:start position:0%
you represent lad I just like to as a
 
01:59:31.950 --> 01:59:31.960 align:start position:0%
point of
 
01:59:35.310 --> 01:59:35.320 align:start position:0%
clarification um we've had
 
01:59:37.950 --> 01:59:37.960 align:start position:0%
previous cases through Claremont and
 
01:59:40.750 --> 01:59:40.760 align:start position:0%
londondary that the money that's
 
01:59:42.750 --> 01:59:42.760 align:start position:0%
allocated for
 
01:59:45.189 --> 01:59:45.199 align:start position:0%
adequacy that's the left hand side of
 
01:59:47.510 --> 01:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
the column base cost and differentiate
 
01:59:50.229 --> 01:59:50.239 align:start position:0%
Aid is not
 
01:59:52.189 --> 01:59:52.199 align:start position:0%
targeted that means it's
 
01:59:54.870 --> 01:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional for us to say You must
 
01:59:56.870 --> 01:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
spend this money for this particular
 
01:59:58.390 --> 01:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
task even though we're saying it's for
 
02:00:01.430 --> 02:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
elll or we're saying it's a result or
 
02:00:04.030 --> 02:00:04.040 align:start position:0%
sped or if it's a direct result for the
 
02:00:07.229 --> 02:00:07.239 align:start position:0%
fnr that's there for poverty it goes
 
02:00:10.390 --> 02:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
down to the school board to use
 
02:00:12.069 --> 02:00:12.079 align:start position:0%
hopefully for that task because they're
 
02:00:13.910 --> 02:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
going to have to pay that money anyways
 
02:00:16.990 --> 02:00:17.000 align:start position:0%
out to cost out that special education
 
02:00:19.830 --> 02:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
and right now we know that costs for
 
02:00:23.510 --> 02:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
special education are
 
02:00:26.310 --> 02:00:26.320 align:start position:0%
surmounting what we're we're providing
 
02:00:28.709 --> 02:00:28.719 align:start position:0%
so there's no doubt in my mind this
 
02:00:31.109 --> 02:00:31.119 align:start position:0%
money is being used for special
 
02:00:33.830 --> 02:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
education um now catastrophic Aid is a
 
02:00:35.550 --> 02:00:35.560 align:start position:0%
whole different issue and we do have a
 
02:00:37.350 --> 02:00:37.360 align:start position:0%
bill which we're going to be coming up
 
02:00:38.629 --> 02:00:38.639 align:start position:0%
it's not an early Bill the
 
02:00:40.189 --> 02:00:40.199 align:start position:0%
representative who's sponsoring that
 
02:00:42.470 --> 02:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
sitting at the table right now and we've
 
02:00:45.669 --> 02:00:45.679 align:start position:0%
had discussion even just yesterday uh
 
02:00:47.629 --> 02:00:47.639 align:start position:0%
how we approached that not as a
 
02:00:50.270 --> 02:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
committee but we had the discussion uh
 
02:00:52.310 --> 02:00:52.320 align:start position:0%
how to approach this and how to really
 
02:00:55.870 --> 02:00:55.880 align:start position:0%
get a a study done on on how we're going
 
02:00:57.870 --> 02:00:57.880 align:start position:0%
to allocate monies that are going to
 
02:01:00.189 --> 02:01:00.199 align:start position:0%
cover the cost of the as you speak to
 
02:01:02.589 --> 02:01:02.599 align:start position:0%
represent elure the the catastrophic Aid
 
02:01:05.870 --> 02:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
issues a huge issue and we have multiple
 
02:01:07.750 --> 02:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
districts that are shouting about this
 
02:01:10.990 --> 02:01:11.000 align:start position:0%
one and we need to look at it and it's
 
02:01:14.790 --> 02:01:14.800 align:start position:0%
my suggestion that I saw a whole lot of
 
02:01:16.830 --> 02:01:16.840 align:start position:0%
work being done in a short time when we
 
02:01:18.629 --> 02:01:18.639 align:start position:0%
involved people on a committee that came
 
02:01:20.669 --> 02:01:20.679 align:start position:0%
in from Ways and Means finance and
 
02:01:23.069 --> 02:01:23.079 align:start position:0%
policy and hopefully we set up a similar
 
02:01:25.669 --> 02:01:25.679 align:start position:0%
situation that will move us forward and
 
02:01:27.310 --> 02:01:27.320 align:start position:0%
come out with that answer that we're all
 
02:01:30.069 --> 02:01:30.079 align:start position:0%
looking for how how can we help that
 
02:01:31.390 --> 02:01:31.400 align:start position:0%
District all of a sudden has a kid
 
02:01:32.990 --> 02:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
walking the door and there's another
 
02:01:35.390 --> 02:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
$300,000 child that we don't have any
 
02:01:38.629 --> 02:01:38.639 align:start position:0%
money in any account to to satisfy thank
 
02:01:42.950 --> 02:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
you repres ter you did you
 
02:01:46.870 --> 02:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
no okay thank you represent beler thank
 
02:01:47.950 --> 02:01:47.960 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for that
 
02:01:49.629 --> 02:01:49.639 align:start position:0%
clarification I just wanted to seek one
 
02:01:51.270 --> 02:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
further piece of clarification I wasn't
 
02:01:54.189 --> 02:01:54.199 align:start position:0%
on this subcommittee um and as you said
 
02:01:55.629 --> 02:01:55.639 align:start position:0%
based on the constitutional ruling from
 
02:01:58.950 --> 02:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
the court we cannot direct adequacy
 
02:02:01.350 --> 02:02:01.360 align:start position:0%
funds from the state level but is there
 
02:02:03.470 --> 02:02:03.480 align:start position:0%
any reason that we would have to address
 
02:02:05.709 --> 02:02:05.719 align:start position:0%
this issue under adequacy as opposed to
 
02:02:08.149 --> 02:02:08.159 align:start position:0%
under catastrophic Aid where we can
 
02:02:10.629 --> 02:02:10.639 align:start position:0%
direct those funds just to special
 
02:02:13.870 --> 02:02:13.880 align:start position:0%
education use and I can respond to that
 
02:02:15.390 --> 02:02:15.400 align:start position:0%
when we put money out in the
 
02:02:17.229 --> 02:02:17.239 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant or some of the
 
02:02:19.030 --> 02:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
Grant on the right hand side those are
 
02:02:21.750 --> 02:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
are Grant monies which can have
 
02:02:26.109 --> 02:02:26.119 align:start position:0%
accountability linked to it and before
 
02:02:28.470 --> 02:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
we go that that route I think what we
 
02:02:31.350 --> 02:02:31.360 align:start position:0%
have to do is there there's other means
 
02:02:33.709 --> 02:02:33.719 align:start position:0%
that we have available to us to really
 
02:02:35.870 --> 02:02:35.880 align:start position:0%
assess where this money is going
 
02:02:39.270 --> 02:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
especially I I have real concern about
 
02:02:41.350 --> 02:02:41.360 align:start position:0%
residential placements out ofate
 
02:02:43.709 --> 02:02:43.719 align:start position:0%
placements and ensuring that that money
 
02:02:46.629 --> 02:02:46.639 align:start position:0%
is being used appropriately um and we're
 
02:02:48.589 --> 02:02:48.599 align:start position:0%
getting the value back for what we're
 
02:02:51.229 --> 02:02:51.239 align:start position:0%
spending in and the way we really
 
02:02:54.510 --> 02:02:54.520 align:start position:0%
ascertain that is through the LBA and a
 
02:02:57.669 --> 02:02:57.679 align:start position:0%
performance audit and that's a huge task
 
02:03:00.990 --> 02:03:01.000 align:start position:0%
that we have may have to take
 
02:03:03.510 --> 02:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
represent thank you and that Mak my
 
02:03:05.109 --> 02:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
question can you give us a status of
 
02:03:13.189 --> 02:03:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:15.229 --> 02:03:15.239 align:start position:0%
subject represent
 
02:03:20.550 --> 02:03:20.560 align:start position:0%
Casen thank you yes it was um
 
02:03:23.510 --> 02:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
so this is really a remarkable bill in
 
02:03:25.550 --> 02:03:25.560 align:start position:0%
terms of telling communities and school
 
02:03:27.990 --> 02:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
districts that we're paying attention I
 
02:03:30.229 --> 02:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
mean for anybody to understand that
 
02:03:32.550 --> 02:03:32.560 align:start position:0%
there is no way this is a slush fun is
 
02:03:34.990 --> 02:03:35.000 align:start position:0%
you you need to understand what Esa is
 
02:03:37.189 --> 02:03:37.199 align:start position:0%
of the federal law because there's
 
02:03:39.430 --> 02:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
criteria for students with disabilities
 
02:03:40.950 --> 02:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
they aren't just somebody who's not
 
02:03:43.870 --> 02:03:43.880 align:start position:0%
feeling good that day or somebody who
 
02:03:46.310 --> 02:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
has an emotional breakdown that's not
 
02:03:48.910 --> 02:03:48.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily what it is it's very
 
02:03:51.470 --> 02:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
involved and some of these students
 
02:03:53.470 --> 02:03:53.480 align:start position:0%
identified are very involved medically
 
02:03:57.229 --> 02:03:57.239 align:start position:0%
as well um I think it's it's very
 
02:04:00.870 --> 02:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
remarkable to have uh these categories
 
02:04:03.030 --> 02:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
that are so important every single
 
02:04:06.229 --> 02:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
student that qualifies to be identified
 
02:04:08.830 --> 02:04:08.840 align:start position:0%
and that doesn't necessarily mean a slow
 
02:04:11.629 --> 02:04:11.639 align:start position:0%
learner a slow learner does not
 
02:04:13.910 --> 02:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily meet the criteria to be
 
02:04:16.589 --> 02:04:16.599 align:start position:0%
identified for a student whoes special
 
02:04:19.470 --> 02:04:19.480 align:start position:0%
education services but the C ories all
 
02:04:21.270 --> 02:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
kids need to be in the least restrictive
 
02:04:26.149 --> 02:04:26.159 align:start position:0%
environment first and these categories
 
02:04:28.430 --> 02:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
really send a
 
02:04:31.109 --> 02:04:31.119 align:start position:0%
message that schools need to be set up
 
02:04:33.950 --> 02:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
to have a variety of programs to Ser as
 
02:04:36.910 --> 02:04:36.920 align:start position:0%
kids in small groups and large groups
 
02:04:38.669 --> 02:04:38.679 align:start position:0%
and then the equipment that needs to be
 
02:04:41.430 --> 02:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
purchased on any given day for any given
 
02:04:45.310 --> 02:04:45.320 align:start position:0%
student is all based on federal law
 
02:04:48.990 --> 02:04:49.000 align:start position:0%
requiring a school district to have
 
02:04:51.390 --> 02:04:51.400 align:start position:0%
these items to have this specialized
 
02:04:53.790 --> 02:04:53.800 align:start position:0%
staff to have this space so there's a
 
02:04:56.510 --> 02:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
lot of federal requirements that you
 
02:04:59.589 --> 02:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
must have and so the
 
02:05:02.270 --> 02:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
documentation of how these services are
 
02:05:04.870 --> 02:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
delivered cannot happen without parental
 
02:05:08.669 --> 02:05:08.679 align:start position:0%
permission at any level and it also
 
02:05:08.679 --> 02:05:09.990 align:start position:0%
permission at any level and it also
tracks

02:05:09.990 --> 02:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
tracks
 
02:05:13.030 --> 02:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
progress um of students to make sure
 
02:05:14.870 --> 02:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
that there is always the goal of least
 
02:05:17.589 --> 02:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
restrictive environment so that the fact
 
02:05:20.030 --> 02:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
that we have this category ABC and I
 
02:05:22.069 --> 02:05:22.079 align:start position:0%
think we had looked at at some point at
 
02:05:23.910 --> 02:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
the education Commission of the 50
 
02:05:25.950 --> 02:05:25.960 align:start position:0%
states on school
 
02:05:28.950 --> 02:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
funding and we really really needed to
 
02:05:32.430 --> 02:05:32.440 align:start position:0%
do something and I just would love to
 
02:05:33.990 --> 02:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
see this
 
02:05:36.870 --> 02:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
happen thank you thank you anything for
 
02:05:40.510 --> 02:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
representative dry thank you for that um
 
02:05:43.149 --> 02:05:43.159 align:start position:0%
uh discussion I was actually asking like
 
02:05:46.109 --> 02:05:46.119 align:start position:0%
the LBA audit of things U where the
 
02:05:48.830 --> 02:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
status of that is that's a report that's
 
02:05:50.549 --> 02:05:50.559 align:start position:0%
very lengthy report that they do and
 
02:05:52.870 --> 02:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
they report back to the legislature on
 
02:05:55.549 --> 02:05:55.559 align:start position:0%
that as far as audits are concerned the
 
02:05:58.950 --> 02:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
doe2 form does not have to be audited
 
02:06:01.270 --> 02:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
some school districts I would imagine
 
02:06:02.870 --> 02:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
the larger ones like a Manchester
 
02:06:04.750 --> 02:06:04.760 align:start position:0%
certainly audit that form before that
 
02:06:08.149 --> 02:06:08.159 align:start position:0%
goes out to the to the department uh
 
02:06:11.109 --> 02:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
smaller districts may not uh but all
 
02:06:13.189 --> 02:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
districts are required to audit each
 
02:06:16.229 --> 02:06:16.239 align:start position:0%
year and so they we have a good idea of
 
02:06:18.149 --> 02:06:18.159 align:start position:0%
how the ass where the assets are where
 
02:06:20.069 --> 02:06:20.079 align:start position:0%
the revenue where the expenses are
 
02:06:22.870 --> 02:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
however um we need to get down deeper
 
02:06:24.830 --> 02:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
into these expenses and we're not
 
02:06:28.350 --> 02:06:28.360 align:start position:0%
getting all that information so um I I'm
 
02:06:30.270 --> 02:06:30.280 align:start position:0%
not saying we're going the direction of
 
02:06:33.069 --> 02:06:33.079 align:start position:0%
the a performance audit but it may lead
 
02:06:34.990 --> 02:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
to that with some of the issues which
 
02:06:37.109 --> 02:06:37.119 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with some of those severe
 
02:06:40.390 --> 02:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
issues of placement outside the
 
02:06:40.400 --> 02:06:42.270 align:start position:0%
issues of placement outside the
state

02:06:42.270 --> 02:06:42.280 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:06:45.149 --> 02:06:45.159 align:start position:0%

chance I Look to uh representative leus
 
02:09:04.310 --> 02:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
for a
 
02:09:06.589 --> 02:09:06.599 align:start position:0%
motion I move
 
02:09:11.549 --> 02:09:11.559 align:start position:0%
OTP is there a second second so we have
 
02:09:14.990 --> 02:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
a motion made by represent alus as OTP
 
02:09:17.830 --> 02:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
and second by represented cordelli for
 
02:09:17.840 --> 02:09:18.910 align:start position:0%
and second by represented cordelli for
HP

02:09:18.910 --> 02:09:18.920 align:start position:0%
HP
 
02:09:21.229 --> 02:09:21.239 align:start position:0%
1517 further discussion from the maker
 
02:09:22.910 --> 02:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:09:27.709 --> 02:09:27.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:33.629 --> 02:09:33.639 align:start position:0%
is a a move to take the money extra
 
02:09:37.149 --> 02:09:37.159 align:start position:0%
money out of the ucation trust fund and
 
02:09:39.950 --> 02:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
put it in the general fund and this
 
02:09:42.709 --> 02:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
would be an alternative which would say
 
02:09:44.270 --> 02:09:44.280 align:start position:0%
take the excess
 
02:09:48.470 --> 02:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
money um the excess not just what
 
02:09:50.549 --> 02:09:50.559 align:start position:0%
happens to be in it but over and above
 
02:09:54.629 --> 02:09:54.639 align:start position:0%
what we normally would get and use it to
 
02:09:54.639 --> 02:09:56.069 align:start position:0%
what we normally would get and use it to
directly

02:09:56.069 --> 02:09:56.079 align:start position:0%
directly
 
02:10:00.750 --> 02:10:00.760 align:start position:0%
reduce taxes on the residents of the
 
02:10:07.350 --> 02:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
state and I and I see that we come in
 
02:10:09.149 --> 02:10:09.159 align:start position:0%
all the time we have people please
 
02:10:11.270 --> 02:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
reduce our taxes our taxes are killing
 
02:10:14.430 --> 02:10:14.440 align:start position:0%
us property taxes are killing us this is
 
02:10:17.750 --> 02:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for us to actually reduce
 
02:10:21.870 --> 02:10:21.880 align:start position:0%
those property taxes by applying that
 
02:10:24.910 --> 02:10:24.920 align:start position:0%
extra money that may come in from
 
02:10:29.350 --> 02:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
gambling directly to what a town would
 
02:10:31.470 --> 02:10:31.480 align:start position:0%
have to pay for swept so instead of
 
02:10:34.390 --> 02:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
having to pay whatever it is that it's
 
02:10:37.790 --> 02:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
calculated it would be that much minus
 
02:10:41.109 --> 02:10:41.119 align:start position:0%
the money that is coming in from this
 
02:10:45.870 --> 02:10:45.880 align:start position:0%
excess um gambling money so it is a way
 
02:10:49.790 --> 02:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
I see of directly reducing people's
 
02:10:52.790 --> 02:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
taxes and I think that is an excellent
 
02:10:54.990 --> 02:10:55.000 align:start position:0%
thing and I would much rather see that
 
02:10:57.390 --> 02:10:57.400 align:start position:0%
happen than just put into the general
 
02:11:00.589 --> 02:11:00.599 align:start position:0%
fund thank you further discussion
 
02:11:02.709 --> 02:11:02.719 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli thank you I I
 
02:11:04.629 --> 02:11:04.639 align:start position:0%
agree with the comments of
 
02:11:08.310 --> 02:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
Representative lakas um just add that uh
 
02:11:11.189 --> 02:11:11.199 align:start position:0%
during the hearing um the discussion was
 
02:11:15.430 --> 02:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
of the uh $6.6 million as the base to
 
02:11:20.030 --> 02:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
determine what was excess uh revenue and
 
02:11:23.030 --> 02:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
I think that um there was wide agreement
 
02:11:25.510 --> 02:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
that the next committee could better
 
02:11:29.109 --> 02:11:29.119 align:start position:0%
look at that $6.6 million to see if that
 
02:11:32.629 --> 02:11:32.639 align:start position:0%
is in fact the right number thank you
 
02:11:34.589 --> 02:11:34.599 align:start position:0%
further discuss from represent beler
 
02:11:36.149 --> 02:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I would tend to agree
 
02:11:37.549 --> 02:11:37.559 align:start position:0%
with all the previous comments and I'd
 
02:11:40.709 --> 02:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
just like to add that um this wouldn't
 
02:11:43.830 --> 02:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
do anything to reduce the fund because
 
02:11:46.189 --> 02:11:46.199 align:start position:0%
it's only if increases go over the the
 
02:11:49.030 --> 02:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
certain amount that already exists and
 
02:11:51.430 --> 02:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
it gives the localities this option that
 
02:11:53.790 --> 02:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
if they need money for their school for
 
02:11:56.629 --> 02:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
whatever reason well if we're reducing
 
02:11:58.549 --> 02:11:58.559 align:start position:0%
the state portion of the swep there's no
 
02:12:00.030 --> 02:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
reason they couldn't offset that with
 
02:12:02.950 --> 02:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
the local portion with a Net Zero Effect
 
02:12:05.270 --> 02:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
that their local taxpayers and recoup
 
02:12:08.149 --> 02:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
those funds for what they need to do
 
02:12:11.350 --> 02:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
locally thank you represent
 
02:12:14.470 --> 02:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
Miler thank you Mr chair I think I made
 
02:12:18.549 --> 02:12:18.559 align:start position:0%
my position pretty clear uh about my
 
02:12:20.270 --> 02:12:20.280 align:start position:0%
feelings about games of
 
02:12:23.830 --> 02:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
chance I'll be voting against this uh
 
02:12:26.709 --> 02:12:26.719 align:start position:0%
but further in the conversation that we
 
02:12:29.470 --> 02:12:29.480 align:start position:0%
had uh just the other day with represent
 
02:12:32.390 --> 02:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
Harrington there was really no uh idea
 
02:12:34.069 --> 02:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
of exactly what the impact of this would
 
02:12:36.709 --> 02:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
be there's no data presided other than
 
02:12:39.430 --> 02:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
the numbers about the 6.6 million we
 
02:12:41.470 --> 02:12:41.480 align:start position:0%
have no idea what that is we have no
 
02:12:45.390 --> 02:12:45.400 align:start position:0%
idea what's coming in from uh the gaming
 
02:12:48.589 --> 02:12:48.599 align:start position:0%
uh program here in the state and I just
 
02:12:50.229 --> 02:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
think there's a lot of information that
 
02:12:52.750 --> 02:12:52.760 align:start position:0%
we don't have yet and to pass this on
 
02:12:55.350 --> 02:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
without having that data is really uh
 
02:12:57.870 --> 02:12:57.880 align:start position:0%
not very responsible of this committee
 
02:12:59.549 --> 02:12:59.559 align:start position:0%
and I would urge uh members of the
 
02:13:01.709 --> 02:13:01.719 align:start position:0%
committee to vote against this
 
02:13:04.390 --> 02:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
OTP further
 
02:13:07.470 --> 02:13:07.480 align:start position:0%
discussion represent luno thank you very
 
02:13:10.189 --> 02:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
much Mr chair so you know we we tried
 
02:13:13.069 --> 02:13:13.079 align:start position:0%
this experiment for years ago in the
 
02:13:15.910 --> 02:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
state budget when the uh swept was
 
02:13:18.669 --> 02:13:18.679 align:start position:0%
reduced by $100 million and
 
02:13:20.390 --> 02:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh pretty much turned out to be a failed
 
02:13:23.069 --> 02:13:23.079 align:start position:0%
experiment then it didn't really save
 
02:13:26.109 --> 02:13:26.119 align:start position:0%
anybody um reduce anybody's property
 
02:13:28.709 --> 02:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
taxes by very much at all but it did put
 
02:13:31.430 --> 02:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
High demands on um on other Revenue
 
02:13:34.069 --> 02:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
sources to make up for that difference
 
02:13:37.910 --> 02:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
in the um education trust fund so uh so
 
02:13:40.069 --> 02:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
uh I I think for certainly for those
 
02:13:42.950 --> 02:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
reasons it's been tried before it failed
 
02:13:44.350 --> 02:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
back then there's no reason to think
 
02:13:46.229 --> 02:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
this is going to be any
 
02:13:48.350 --> 02:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
different further discussion question
 
02:13:50.669 --> 02:13:50.679 align:start position:0%
represent Celli I would just point out
 
02:13:53.149 --> 02:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
that when um that reduction to swept did
 
02:13:55.430 --> 02:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
take place there was offsetting funds
 
02:13:57.510 --> 02:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
identified and that was part of the
 
02:14:00.189 --> 02:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
calculation and uh part of what was
 
02:14:02.910 --> 02:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
included in the budget at that point uh
 
02:14:05.990 --> 02:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
but I would also if I could follow up
 
02:14:09.510 --> 02:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
with that um to uh just point out that
 
02:14:13.990 --> 02:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
um we did have a testimony from Dr um
 
02:14:16.870 --> 02:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
who's here again today um with some
 
02:14:20.750 --> 02:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
suggestions about how the uh legislation
 
02:14:23.709 --> 02:14:23.719 align:start position:0%
could be improved and I think um those
 
02:14:25.350 --> 02:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
certainly should be passed on to the
 
02:14:25.360 --> 02:14:27.310 align:start position:0%
certainly should be passed on to the
next

02:14:27.310 --> 02:14:27.320 align:start position:0%
next
 
02:14:29.709 --> 02:14:29.719 align:start position:0%
committee further discussion on the bill
 
02:14:33.270 --> 02:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
represent Miler Andes just to add to my
 
02:14:36.629 --> 02:14:36.639 align:start position:0%
note should this motion fail I would
 
02:14:38.750 --> 02:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
move to interim study
 
02:14:42.109 --> 02:14:42.119 align:start position:0%
this represent
 
02:14:44.950 --> 02:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
leus I kind of object to the idea that
 
02:14:47.149 --> 02:14:47.159 align:start position:0%
no savings I think that depends upon
 
02:14:49.870 --> 02:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
what town you are were in our town di
 
02:14:52.390 --> 02:14:52.400 align:start position:0%
did actually have a tax savings and our
 
02:14:55.069 --> 02:14:55.079 align:start position:0%
taxes did actually go down because we
 
02:14:58.109 --> 02:14:58.119 align:start position:0%
did not choose to take that money and
 
02:15:01.350 --> 02:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
spend it elsewhere we used it to reduce
 
02:15:04.950 --> 02:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
our taxes as was the intent and so this
 
02:15:07.270 --> 02:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
is a local control issue if the
 
02:15:09.109 --> 02:15:09.119 align:start position:0%
taxpayers decide they're going to use
 
02:15:11.830 --> 02:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
that money that we give back to spend
 
02:15:13.990 --> 02:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
elsewhere that's up to them but we have
 
02:15:16.549 --> 02:15:16.559 align:start position:0%
given them the opportunity to save money
 
02:15:20.149 --> 02:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
on their taxes and towns did thank you
 
02:15:22.350 --> 02:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
representative Cordell thank you Mr
 
02:15:24.270 --> 02:15:24.280 align:start position:0%
chair I just want to go on record um I'm
 
02:15:26.629 --> 02:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
no fan of gambling um I think it does a
 
02:15:29.750 --> 02:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
lot of harm to people but the my
 
02:15:31.390 --> 02:15:31.400 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill is in no way a
 
02:15:33.229 --> 02:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
support of gambling itself gambling will
 
02:15:36.189 --> 02:15:36.199 align:start position:0%
go on whether or not we have this bill
 
02:15:39.510 --> 02:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
um but um it does in a way uh bring some
 
02:15:42.069 --> 02:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
good out of it and I know um that there
 
02:15:44.069 --> 02:15:44.079 align:start position:0%
are organizations who benefit greatly
 
02:15:46.390 --> 02:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
from this uh this sort of charitable
 
02:15:48.470 --> 02:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
gaming so
 
02:15:51.149 --> 02:15:51.159 align:start position:0%
okay further discussion representa
 
02:15:53.109 --> 02:15:53.119 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you Mr chair I just wanted
 
02:15:54.270 --> 02:15:54.280 align:start position:0%
to further clarify some of the
 
02:15:56.270 --> 02:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
information we just heard so with this
 
02:15:58.589 --> 02:15:58.599 align:start position:0%
bill we we know exactly what the effect
 
02:16:00.270 --> 02:16:00.280 align:start position:0%
of this bill will be on the education
 
02:16:01.950 --> 02:16:01.960 align:start position:0%
trust fund because we have those numbers
 
02:16:04.229 --> 02:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
and it and it isn't to drop beneath a
 
02:16:06.430 --> 02:16:06.440 align:start position:0%
certain number in the future it's only
 
02:16:07.910 --> 02:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
things in excess of that so the only
 
02:16:10.549 --> 02:16:10.559 align:start position:0%
unknown we have with this bill is how
 
02:16:12.030 --> 02:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
much if any money we will be returning
 
02:16:16.109 --> 02:16:16.119 align:start position:0%
to taxpayers thank you further

caucus are we ready to move on I had a
 
02:17:31.349 --> 02:17:31.359 align:start position:0%
procedural question I guess it could
 
02:17:34.030 --> 02:17:34.040 align:start position:0%
apply to everyone not just the caucus if
 
02:17:35.429 --> 02:17:35.439 align:start position:0%
this was interim studied in our
 
02:17:37.349 --> 02:17:37.359 align:start position:0%
committee would that impede a
 
02:17:39.270 --> 02:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
representative from bringing it back to
 
02:17:43.230 --> 02:17:43.240 align:start position:0%
be reassigned to Ways and Means next
 
02:17:48.389 --> 02:17:48.399 align:start position:0%
year the an interim study results in in
 
02:17:51.150 --> 02:17:51.160 align:start position:0%
the study either making a recommendation
 
02:17:53.870 --> 02:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
that it move forward or not or even
 
02:17:56.110 --> 02:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
projecting some kind of an amendment to
 
02:17:58.629 --> 02:17:58.639 align:start position:0%
you know work on it so it wouldn't be
 
02:18:03.150 --> 02:18:03.160 align:start position:0%
occurring in this bium it be in the next

discussion representative lad uh yes uh
 
02:21:01.070 --> 02:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
I feel that this bill needs to go to
 
02:21:02.830 --> 02:21:02.840 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means and there's a lot of
 
02:21:05.910 --> 02:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
issues that I don't think this committee
 
02:21:09.870 --> 02:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
is uh is not our task uh and it probably
 
02:21:12.309 --> 02:21:12.319 align:start position:0%
should have been a bill that gone to way
 
02:21:14.870 --> 02:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
means from the get-go but uh I'm not
 
02:21:17.670 --> 02:21:17.680 align:start position:0%
going to speak any more to it um that's
 
02:21:18.950 --> 02:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
just my
 
02:21:21.030 --> 02:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
slant resident
 
02:21:23.429 --> 02:21:23.439 align:start position:0%
luno I agree with what representative
 
02:21:23.439 --> 02:21:25.710 align:start position:0%
luno I agree with what representative
lad

02:21:25.710 --> 02:21:25.720 align:start position:0%
lad
 
02:21:29.630 --> 02:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
said representative uh cascaden thank
 
02:21:31.750 --> 02:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um just want to make the
 
02:21:34.550 --> 02:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
statement that this this bill would be
 
02:21:38.230 --> 02:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
um a response to the Rand case that was
 
02:21:40.910 --> 02:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
recently filed and the summary judgment
 
02:21:44.910 --> 02:21:44.920 align:start position:0%
that was provided and this is showing
 
02:21:46.550 --> 02:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
the courts and the public that we are
 
02:21:52.469 --> 02:21:52.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:56.070 --> 02:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
seriously further comment uh represent
 
02:21:58.950 --> 02:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
dry thank you
 
02:22:01.710 --> 02:22:01.720 align:start position:0%
uh if this goes to Ways and Means
 
02:22:03.070 --> 02:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
where's the place maybe this is a better
 
02:22:04.990 --> 02:22:05.000 align:start position:0%
question where's the place to address
 
02:22:08.110 --> 02:22:08.120 align:start position:0%
the part about setting negative local
 
02:22:11.429 --> 02:22:11.439 align:start position:0%
tax rates because we've heard from Dr
 
02:22:13.270 --> 02:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
that there were some that were not
 
02:22:15.230 --> 02:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
associated with swept that were
 
02:22:17.510 --> 02:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
naturally occurring and want to make
 
02:22:23.030 --> 02:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:25.510 --> 02:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
forward I why don't you ask for
 
02:22:28.830 --> 02:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
technical support yeah
 
02:22:33.429 --> 02:22:33.439 align:start position:0%
um me ask answer one more question
 
02:22:35.469 --> 02:22:35.479 align:start position:0%
represent lak did you have a separate
 
02:22:38.990 --> 02:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
question yes different question
 
02:22:43.230 --> 02:22:43.240 align:start position:0%
yes my question was can we vacate this
 
02:22:45.389 --> 02:22:45.399 align:start position:0%
directly to
 
02:22:48.550 --> 02:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
no no it would not be an early bill
 
02:22:50.230 --> 02:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
because it would not be going to another
 
02:22:52.429 --> 02:22:52.439 align:start position:0%
committee they would be the committee
 
02:22:53.950 --> 02:22:53.960 align:start position:0%
and therefore they would have it is an
 
02:22:57.070 --> 02:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
early bill and we have to get it out of
 
02:23:00.950 --> 02:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
here by the 15th and there's no I can't
 
02:23:04.550 --> 02:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
vacate it until we have another session
 
02:23:09.990 --> 02:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:14.469 --> 02:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
15th um perhaps the gentleman from uh
 
02:23:16.110 --> 02:23:16.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration
 
02:23:18.349 --> 02:23:18.359 align:start position:0%
could come up for some technical
 
02:23:21.750 --> 02:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
questions um we had one about the uh
 
02:23:21.760 --> 02:23:36.750 align:start position:0%
questions um we had one about the uh
negative

02:23:36.750 --> 02:23:36.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:38.510 --> 02:23:38.520 align:start position:0%

02:23:46.070 --> 02:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
Bureau at the Department of
 
02:23:46.080 --> 02:23:47.950 align:start position:0%
Bureau at the Department of
Revenue

02:23:47.950 --> 02:23:47.960 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
02:23:49.349 --> 02:23:49.359 align:start position:0%
uh representative Tri would you like to
 
02:23:50.710 --> 02:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
repeat your
 
02:23:52.790 --> 02:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
question thank you just going back to
 
02:23:54.110 --> 02:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
what we did in the subcommittee could
 
02:23:55.990 --> 02:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
you tell us about pleases where there
 
02:24:02.190 --> 02:24:02.200 align:start position:0%
are negative um tax uh rates set yes um
 
02:24:05.150 --> 02:24:05.160 align:start position:0%
in a certain sort of touch of irony this
 
02:24:07.269 --> 02:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
year there were two
 
02:24:11.830 --> 02:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities whose Municipal tax
 
02:24:15.590 --> 02:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
rate um was determined to be negative
 
02:24:17.590 --> 02:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
because of an excess of
 
02:24:19.230 --> 02:24:19.240 align:start position:0%
revenues in those
 
02:24:22.389 --> 02:24:22.399 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh those two uh
 
02:24:24.550 --> 02:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities were the identical
 
02:24:26.590 --> 02:24:26.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities that I found on the
 
02:24:30.030 --> 02:24:30.040 align:start position:0%
oldest existing records I could find I
 
02:24:33.710 --> 02:24:33.720 align:start position:0%
believe it was 1975 they also had
 
02:24:38.710 --> 02:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
negative local Municipal um rates due to
 
02:24:41.630 --> 02:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
probably the same reason uh the excess
 
02:24:45.950 --> 02:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:45.960 --> 02:24:47.830 align:start position:0%
 
each

02:24:47.830 --> 02:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
each
 
02:24:51.030 --> 02:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
followup yes followup would be if if
 
02:24:54.469 --> 02:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
this bill went through as past you would
 
02:24:57.429 --> 02:24:57.439 align:start position:0%
be basically
 
02:25:01.550 --> 02:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
um unable to set a you would not be able
 
02:25:04.110 --> 02:25:04.120 align:start position:0%
to set a negative local education or
 
02:25:06.710 --> 02:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
County tax rate to offset other taxes on
 
02:25:10.710 --> 02:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
Real Property um my my reading of the
 
02:25:13.389 --> 02:25:13.399 align:start position:0%
bill as written it would preclude
 
02:25:17.110 --> 02:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
setting any negative rates uh if you
 
02:25:19.030 --> 02:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
consider your property tax bills we'll
 
02:25:21.790 --> 02:25:21.800 align:start position:0%
call it the municipal the county the
 
02:25:23.710 --> 02:25:23.720 align:start position:0%
local school rate and the State
 
02:25:25.590 --> 02:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
education property tax
 
02:25:28.910 --> 02:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
rate there would if there would be no
 
02:25:32.389 --> 02:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:37.469 --> 02:25:37.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:40.990 --> 02:25:41.000 align:start position:0%
problem to the Department of Revenue it
 
02:25:43.590 --> 02:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't pose a problem and we would stop
 
02:25:45.870 --> 02:25:45.880 align:start position:0%
the calculation at
 
02:25:45.880 --> 02:25:47.550 align:start position:0%
the calculation at
zero

02:25:47.550 --> 02:25:47.560 align:start position:0%
zero
 
02:25:49.750 --> 02:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
um what that
 
02:25:52.910 --> 02:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
means in Practical
 
02:25:55.710 --> 02:25:55.720 align:start position:0%
terms um I look at it from the
 
02:25:59.750 --> 02:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
perspective of uh an individual property
 
02:25:59.760 --> 02:26:01.110 align:start position:0%
perspective of uh an individual property
tax

02:26:01.110 --> 02:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
tax
 
02:26:04.309 --> 02:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
bill as you all know I suspect you all
 
02:26:07.230 --> 02:26:07.240 align:start position:0%
know is that you're looking at a total
 
02:26:09.110 --> 02:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
rate which is the
 
02:26:12.950 --> 02:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
combined sum of those four rates well
 
02:26:15.510 --> 02:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
currently if one of them is negative the
 
02:26:17.790 --> 02:26:17.800 align:start position:0%
total is going to be lower
 
02:26:19.790 --> 02:26:19.800 align:start position:0%
if you stop the calculation of an
 
02:26:23.710 --> 02:26:23.720 align:start position:0%
individual component at zero perforce
 
02:26:26.469 --> 02:26:26.479 align:start position:0%
the total is going to be
 
02:26:30.190 --> 02:26:30.200 align:start position:0%
higher I'm a property taxpayer myself
 
02:26:33.309 --> 02:26:33.319 align:start position:0%
that would mean the tax bill I got would
 
02:26:36.590 --> 02:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
require me to turn over more dollars to
 
02:26:36.600 --> 02:26:37.790 align:start position:0%
require me to turn over more dollars to
my

02:26:37.790 --> 02:26:37.800 align:start position:0%
my
 
02:26:39.389 --> 02:26:39.399 align:start position:0%
municipality um and then the
 
02:26:41.550 --> 02:26:41.560 align:start position:0%
municipality knows what it's supposed to
 
02:26:44.389 --> 02:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
do with the total in terms of getting it
 
02:26:47.830 --> 02:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
into the hands of of which um
 
02:26:50.230 --> 02:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
political subdivision is supposed to get
 
02:26:52.830 --> 02:26:52.840 align:start position:0%
which part of that those dollars but it
 
02:26:55.150 --> 02:26:55.160 align:start position:0%
would be more
 
02:26:58.950 --> 02:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
dollars um to the Department of Revenue
 
02:27:01.590 --> 02:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
um we understand the difference but it's
 
02:27:04.670 --> 02:27:04.680 align:start position:0%
mere mathematics as we calculate that
 
02:27:09.870 --> 02:27:09.880 align:start position:0%
total rate and the four normal component
 
02:27:12.309 --> 02:27:12.319 align:start position:0%
rates uh represent did you have your
 
02:27:15.269 --> 02:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
hand up yeah yeah I did
 
02:27:19.750 --> 02:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
um can you just remind me of what the uh
 
02:27:22.269 --> 02:27:22.279 align:start position:0%
excess swep money would be is that
 
02:27:24.590 --> 02:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
around $29
 
02:27:27.830 --> 02:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
million chairman lad I I believe you're
 
02:27:30.790 --> 02:27:30.800 align:start position:0%
in the neighborhood since we do not
 
02:27:33.190 --> 02:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
track that we have no need to currently
 
02:27:35.790 --> 02:27:35.800 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't um keep that number in
 
02:27:37.870 --> 02:27:37.880 align:start position:0%
the on the top of my head I think that's
 
02:27:43.030 --> 02:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
what it is little I believe correct yeah
 
02:27:46.070 --> 02:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
that's anything further from Department
 
02:27:47.670 --> 02:27:47.680 align:start position:0%
of Revenue ad
 
02:27:49.630 --> 02:27:49.640 align:start position:0%
Administration seeing nothing thank you
 
02:27:51.670 --> 02:27:51.680 align:start position:0%
very much for uh providing that
 
02:27:54.389 --> 02:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
information you're quite welcome uh
 
02:27:57.349 --> 02:27:57.359 align:start position:0%
further further discussion uh yes
 
02:27:59.910 --> 02:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
representative but if we passed this and
 
02:28:01.790 --> 02:28:01.800 align:start position:0%
then it went to ways and means nothing
 
02:28:04.990 --> 02:28:05.000 align:start position:0%
would prevent them from amending this to
 
02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:06.150 align:start position:0%
would prevent them from amending this to
say

02:28:06.150 --> 02:28:06.160 align:start position:0%
say
 
02:28:14.550 --> 02:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:17.269 --> 02:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
minus thing tax
 
02:28:18.830 --> 02:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
another Comm another committee could
 
02:28:22.070 --> 02:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
amend it could amend it okay they may
 
02:28:24.870 --> 02:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:28.469 --> 02:28:28.479 align:start position:0%
to um if I could just comment uh I will
 
02:28:33.990 --> 02:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
be um opposing the OTP motion um I I
 
02:28:37.389 --> 02:28:37.399 align:start position:0%
think that things um have gotten
 
02:28:41.510 --> 02:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
conflated um in the courts um about
 
02:28:45.830 --> 02:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
swept um and the uh arguments that it's
 
02:28:50.030 --> 02:28:50.040 align:start position:0%
unconstitu tional the um
 
02:28:52.790 --> 02:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
swep is
 
02:28:56.150 --> 02:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
calculated uniformly and
 
02:28:58.870 --> 02:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
proportionately which is I think what is
 
02:29:02.349 --> 02:29:02.359 align:start position:0%
required um under Article 2 Section Five
 
02:29:03.349 --> 02:29:03.359 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:29:07.349 --> 02:29:07.359 align:start position:0%
Constitution the U discussion becomes
 
02:29:09.670 --> 02:29:09.680 align:start position:0%
the distribution of that money and the
 
02:29:13.790 --> 02:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
fact that uh some local communities that
 
02:29:17.070 --> 02:29:17.080 align:start position:0%
collect more than that can keep it
 
02:29:21.030 --> 02:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
um and I I don't see anything that um in
 
02:29:23.910 --> 02:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
the Constitution that says that that
 
02:29:27.070 --> 02:29:27.080 align:start position:0%
cannot happen um you know I I don't want
 
02:29:29.870 --> 02:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
to play judge but I know I'm contrary to
 
02:29:33.469 --> 02:29:33.479 align:start position:0%
some uh opinions but I I think that um
 
02:29:37.590 --> 02:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
and as I have read the London da uh
 
02:29:40.389 --> 02:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
decision did talk about this and say
 
02:29:43.030 --> 02:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
that the money should be returned but on
 
02:29:45.830 --> 02:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
appeal the Supreme Court uh never
 
02:29:49.150 --> 02:29:49.160 align:start position:0%
endorsed that view uh in the London ter
 
02:29:55.750 --> 02:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
decision so um I cannot support um this
 
02:29:57.630 --> 02:29:57.640 align:start position:0%
um this
 
02:30:00.710 --> 02:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
legislation and uh I I think there might
 
02:30:02.670 --> 02:30:02.680 align:start position:0%
be others in on the committee who feel
 
02:30:06.670 --> 02:30:06.680 align:start position:0%
the same way and uh I know the uh State
 
02:30:10.710 --> 02:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
um is uh actively involved in um in the
 
02:30:14.990 --> 02:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
rant case as was dis dis uh discussed um
 
02:30:17.590 --> 02:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
so I don't know uh that when we'll have
 
02:30:22.269 --> 02:30:22.279 align:start position:0%
a decision by the Supreme Court but um I
 
02:30:24.750 --> 02:30:24.760 align:start position:0%
cannot uh support this legislation
 
02:30:27.710 --> 02:30:27.720 align:start position:0%
because uh I disagree with the concept
 
02:30:30.870 --> 02:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
of uh uh excess swept being returned to
 
02:30:30.880 --> 02:30:31.950 align:start position:0%
of uh uh excess swept being returned to
the

02:30:31.950 --> 02:30:31.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:30:36.389 --> 02:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:40.389 --> 02:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
anybody represent Miler thank you not
 
02:30:43.150 --> 02:30:43.160 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding uh the chair's comments
 
02:30:50.349 --> 02:30:50.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:53.389 --> 02:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
anything further representative
 
02:30:56.670 --> 02:30:56.680 align:start position:0%
pel coming representing Two Towns who
 
02:30:59.550 --> 02:30:59.560 align:start position:0%
collect significant amounts of the
 
02:31:02.910 --> 02:31:02.920 align:start position:0%
Statewide education property tax I'm
 
02:31:05.990 --> 02:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
will not be supporting this um partly
 
02:31:09.790 --> 02:31:09.800 align:start position:0%
because for two reasons one is because
 
02:31:11.590 --> 02:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about these surrounding
 
02:31:13.070 --> 02:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
towns that
 
02:31:16.429 --> 02:31:16.439 align:start position:0%
are we come we have a six town
 
02:31:18.550 --> 02:31:18.560 align:start position:0%
Cooperative district and I'm concerned
 
02:31:20.389 --> 02:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
about the other four towns who do not
 
02:31:23.990 --> 02:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
collect XX swept and how this would
 
02:31:26.870 --> 02:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
impact their educational opportunities
 
02:31:29.670 --> 02:31:29.680 align:start position:0%
when we take that money away from them
 
02:31:32.469 --> 02:31:32.479 align:start position:0%
um the my other concern is that when I
 
02:31:35.070 --> 02:31:35.080 align:start position:0%
look at our property taxes it's listed
 
02:31:35.080 --> 02:31:36.150 align:start position:0%
look at our property taxes it's listed
as

02:31:36.150 --> 02:31:36.160 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:31:41.349 --> 02:31:41.359 align:start position:0%
Municipal local state and County and
 
02:31:43.790 --> 02:31:43.800 align:start position:0%
very few people know that we have this
 
02:31:46.070 --> 02:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
Statewide property tax and have no idea
 
02:31:49.910 --> 02:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
what excess swept means so when we we're
 
02:31:51.710 --> 02:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
going to have to go back to the towns
 
02:31:51.720 --> 02:31:52.790 align:start position:0%
going to have to go back to the towns
and

02:31:52.790 --> 02:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:31:57.550 --> 02:31:57.560 align:start position:0%
explain that two taxes on their tax bill
 
02:32:01.870 --> 02:32:01.880 align:start position:0%
are actually school taxes and I just I'm
 
02:32:03.990 --> 02:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
noticing that people don't are not aware
 
02:32:05.910 --> 02:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
of that and I'm concerned about the
 
02:32:08.269 --> 02:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
impact and the explanation that goes
 
02:32:09.670 --> 02:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
along with
 
02:32:12.590 --> 02:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
that if I could ask um the member a
 
02:32:15.670 --> 02:32:15.680 align:start position:0%
question um so for those other towns in
 
02:32:16.910 --> 02:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
our district
 
02:32:21.269 --> 02:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
you're saying the swept excess from the
 
02:32:24.750 --> 02:32:24.760 align:start position:0%
Two Towns goes to the education of all
 
02:32:26.950 --> 02:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
the kids including those other towns
 
02:32:29.269 --> 02:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
that do not have excess swept is that
 
02:32:31.870 --> 02:32:31.880 align:start position:0%
correct yes that's what I'm
 
02:32:34.790 --> 02:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
saying anything further from the Comm
 
02:32:38.750 --> 02:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
yep represent I'd like to ask then uh
 
02:32:42.510 --> 02:32:42.520 align:start position:0%
molten bar has an excess of $5.1 million
 
02:32:45.230 --> 02:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
where does that money
 
02:32:48.510 --> 02:32:48.520 align:start position:0%
go uh I don't represent molon burough so
 
02:32:50.230 --> 02:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
I can't answer that question I
 
02:32:51.670 --> 02:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
understand yours is a little over $3
 
02:32:51.680 --> 02:32:53.190 align:start position:0%
understand yours is a little over $3
million

02:32:53.190 --> 02:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:32:56.950 --> 02:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
right 1.7 for Wolf burrow
 
02:32:59.790 --> 02:32:59.800 align:start position:0%
and tufton burrow is
 
02:33:04.990 --> 02:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
1.39 it's called 1.4 yeah
 
02:33:09.510 --> 02:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
yep um anything further representative
 
02:33:12.190 --> 02:33:12.200 align:start position:0%
dry yeah I don't want to keep on the
 
02:33:13.990 --> 02:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
same subject but I would like to go on
 
02:33:16.269 --> 02:33:16.279 align:start position:0%
the record is saying is I don't want to
 
02:33:17.990 --> 02:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
hold up anything because of a negative
 
02:33:20.550 --> 02:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
tax rate but I would ask the next
 
02:33:22.710 --> 02:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
committee that um does it on behalf of
 
02:33:24.230 --> 02:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
those people who might be losing money
 
02:33:29.550 --> 02:33:29.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:32.230 --> 02:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
further did I see any other hands oh
 
02:33:34.230 --> 02:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
representative cascaden uh thank you
 
02:33:36.309 --> 02:33:36.319 align:start position:0%
just wanted to add my two sents of
 
02:33:38.510 --> 02:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
course New Hampshire has a history of
 
02:33:40.469 --> 02:33:40.479 align:start position:0%
having Rich towns poor towns not by
 
02:33:43.150 --> 02:33:43.160 align:start position:0%
anybody's fault we don't have a lake
 
02:33:46.510 --> 02:33:46.520 align:start position:0%
some people have a lake um and what this
 
02:33:49.790 --> 02:33:49.800 align:start position:0%
bill does is move that needle so that we
 
02:33:53.190 --> 02:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
are serving all kids equitably versus
 
02:33:55.469 --> 02:33:55.479 align:start position:0%
continuing to have Rich towns in poor
 
02:33:58.070 --> 02:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
towns cuz the people that live in those
 
02:34:00.349 --> 02:34:00.359 align:start position:0%
towns not their fault they have more
 
02:34:02.349 --> 02:34:02.359 align:start position:0%
property I mean I have two prisons they
 
02:34:06.429 --> 02:34:06.439 align:start position:0%
don't P taxes not my fault but we don't
 
02:34:07.750 --> 02:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to raise the
 
02:34:10.110 --> 02:34:10.120 align:start position:0%
revenue that the rich towns have so
 
02:34:11.349 --> 02:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
you're always going to have Rich towns
 
02:34:13.750 --> 02:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
poor towns and we saw a lot of studies
 
02:34:16.950 --> 02:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
and data that kids from disadvantage
 
02:34:20.469 --> 02:34:20.479 align:start position:0%
communities perform lower on test
 
02:34:24.349 --> 02:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
scores and it it's a fact um so we have
 
02:34:25.950 --> 02:34:25.960 align:start position:0%
to think about that do you always want
 
02:34:27.790 --> 02:34:27.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to have rich town and po
 
02:34:30.110 --> 02:34:30.120 align:start position:0%
poor towns in terms of how education is
 
02:34:32.670 --> 02:34:32.680 align:start position:0%
delivered and funded and that's that's a
 
02:34:34.950 --> 02:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
choice we have to make representative
 
02:34:37.550 --> 02:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
patrell thank you representative
 
02:34:39.230 --> 02:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
cascaden would you believe that my
 
02:34:42.429 --> 02:34:42.439 align:start position:0%
school district has an approximately 30%
 
02:34:45.070 --> 02:34:45.080 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch
 
02:34:47.630 --> 02:34:47.640 align:start position:0%
rate representative Kaden just to
 
02:34:47.640 --> 02:34:50.870 align:start position:0%
rate representative Kaden just to
compare

02:34:50.870 --> 02:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:53.670 --> 02:34:53.680 align:start position:0%
60% representative
 
02:34:57.190 --> 02:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
lak I am not sure that the proper term
 
02:34:59.269 --> 02:34:59.279 align:start position:0%
is Rich towns and poor
 
02:35:02.269 --> 02:35:02.279 align:start position:0%
towns because just because you have a
 
02:35:05.630 --> 02:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
lake and if you sold that property it
 
02:35:07.190 --> 02:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
would be you would be able to sell it
 
02:35:09.830 --> 02:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
for a bunch it doesn't mean that you
 
02:35:12.710 --> 02:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
have money it just means that at that
 
02:35:15.269 --> 02:35:15.279 align:start position:0%
time if you ever sell your home but you
 
02:35:18.870 --> 02:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
may not that's your home and so you may
 
02:35:22.150 --> 02:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
have bought that 50 years ago right 40
 
02:35:24.670 --> 02:35:24.680 align:start position:0%
years ago doesn't mean you have money it
 
02:35:26.990 --> 02:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean you're rich it just means
 
02:35:29.190 --> 02:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
that if you were to sell your home that
 
02:35:32.630 --> 02:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
you live in then you'd have money maybe
 
02:35:34.710 --> 02:35:34.720 align:start position:0%
and be rich but until then you're
 
02:35:37.269 --> 02:35:37.279 align:start position:0%
whatever you have and so whatever your
 
02:35:39.990 --> 02:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
property is valued at doesn't make you
 
02:35:42.230 --> 02:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
rich or
 
02:35:45.469 --> 02:35:45.479 align:start position:0%
poor uh just for the record I don't live
 
02:35:47.230 --> 02:35:47.240 align:start position:0%
on the lake
 
02:35:51.950 --> 02:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
um and um with my salary here I hear
 
02:35:56.510 --> 02:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:59.670 --> 02:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
rich further
 
02:36:02.550 --> 02:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
comments repr of lad yeah I I think this
 
02:36:04.990 --> 02:36:05.000 align:start position:0%
can be very divisive I was on the floor
 
02:36:08.309 --> 02:36:08.319 align:start position:0%
in 2011 when we had this conversation
 
02:36:10.150 --> 02:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
and it was a good half day
 
02:36:13.269 --> 02:36:13.279 align:start position:0%
conversation and it it everybody was
 
02:36:14.910 --> 02:36:14.920 align:start position:0%
digging down inside seeing where they
 
02:36:16.750 --> 02:36:16.760 align:start position:0%
stood in that one so
 
02:36:19.630 --> 02:36:19.640 align:start position:0%
um I recognize that folks are going to
 
02:36:21.150 --> 02:36:21.160 align:start position:0%
be probably voting their conscience on
 
02:36:24.030 --> 02:36:24.040 align:start position:0%
this one right here I live on a river
 
02:36:25.230 --> 02:36:25.240 align:start position:0%
and that doesn't really give me a whole
 
02:36:27.510 --> 02:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
lot the fishing's good in there but I
 
02:36:30.830 --> 02:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
have five taxes because we also have
 
02:36:33.269 --> 02:36:33.279 align:start position:0%
amongst the four you mentioned District
 
02:36:37.429 --> 02:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
tax and so that's the the water system
 
02:36:40.110 --> 02:36:40.120 align:start position:0%
etc etc so that adds up too so when we
 
02:36:42.910 --> 02:36:42.920 align:start position:0%
get that mill rate way up in the mid-30s
 
02:36:45.469 --> 02:36:45.479 align:start position:0%
it's it's tough It's very difficult
 
02:36:48.110 --> 02:36:48.120 align:start position:0%
especially in a town where we don't have
 
02:36:50.230 --> 02:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
the industry to back it up or support us
 
02:36:53.710 --> 02:36:53.720 align:start position:0%
in that the property valuation all so um
 
02:36:55.510 --> 02:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
V your conscience in this
 
02:36:59.230 --> 02:36:59.240 align:start position:0%
one anything further I think we've oh
 
02:37:03.349 --> 02:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
yes represent Tanner okay seeing nothing
 
02:37:06.590 --> 02:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
further um I think Madame clerk um we

02:40:12.030 --> 02:40:12.040 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm pausing okay
 
02:40:18.830 --> 02:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:21.030 --> 02:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
okay I didn't know why it
 
02:40:21.040 --> 02:40:22.830 align:start position:0%
okay I didn't know why it
was

02:40:22.830 --> 02:40:22.840 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:40:27.309 --> 02:40:27.319 align:start position:0%
study okay so we have no recommendation
 
02:40:30.429 --> 02:40:30.439 align:start position:0%
here so um is there are there any
 
02:40:32.429 --> 02:40:32.439 align:start position:0%
subsequent motions to be made on this
 
02:40:35.349 --> 02:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:35.359 --> 02:40:37.269 align:start position:0%
 
study

02:40:37.269 --> 02:40:37.279 align:start position:0%
study
 
02:40:41.230 --> 02:40:41.240 align:start position:0%
no there's a move to inter room study uh
 
02:40:44.510 --> 02:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
the bill with a second from represent
 
02:40:44.520 --> 02:40:48.910 align:start position:0%
the bill with a second from represent
beler

02:40:48.910 --> 02:40:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:48.920 --> 02:40:53.269 align:start position:0%
 
further

02:40:53.269 --> 02:40:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:56.230 --> 02:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
discussion well which one represent luno
 
02:40:57.750 --> 02:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks very much I'm not going to
 
02:41:00.110 --> 02:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
support the interim study I think this
 
02:41:03.070 --> 02:41:03.080 align:start position:0%
bill I think this bill needs to um needs
 
02:41:05.910 --> 02:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
to move to Ways and Means uh and and
 
02:41:08.710 --> 02:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
have all of its um structural aspect tax
 
02:41:11.550 --> 02:41:11.560 align:start position:0%
structure aspects of it um considered so
 
02:41:13.670 --> 02:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
if that takes a um you know a floor
 
02:41:15.950 --> 02:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
debate to uh to make that happen
 
02:41:17.630 --> 02:41:17.640 align:start position:0%
then so be it but I'm certainly not
 
02:41:19.269 --> 02:41:19.279 align:start position:0%
going to support interim study and have
 
02:41:22.910 --> 02:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
it have it stop here further
 
02:41:24.870 --> 02:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
discussion represent
 
02:41:27.550 --> 02:41:27.560 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you chairman just to be
 
02:41:30.710 --> 02:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
clear the our intent the intent of the
 
02:41:33.429 --> 02:41:33.439 align:start position:0%
the bill we first started was to receive
 
02:41:35.349 --> 02:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
the bill pass the bill that Ways and
 
02:41:36.550 --> 02:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
Means correct the bill if there are
 
02:41:38.269 --> 02:41:38.279 align:start position:0%
errors in there and review the tax
 
02:41:40.349 --> 02:41:40.359 align:start position:0%
structure that that was the
 
02:41:42.510 --> 02:41:42.520 align:start position:0%
intent I don't know what everybody's
 
02:41:46.750 --> 02:41:46.760 align:start position:0%
intent was but my my intent my my intent
 
02:41:49.510 --> 02:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
was to move the bill to Ways and Means
 
02:41:52.389 --> 02:41:52.399 align:start position:0%
where that bill could be looked at
 
02:41:54.269 --> 02:41:54.279 align:start position:0%
thoroughly by the people are experienced
 
02:41:57.950 --> 02:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
in doing that in terms of the the issues
 
02:42:02.550 --> 02:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
that it contains however um I also feel
 
02:42:05.150 --> 02:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
that this is It's times come where
 
02:42:07.230 --> 02:42:07.240 align:start position:0%
eventually this debate needs to happen
 
02:42:11.750 --> 02:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
on the house floor um than and so I have
 
02:42:14.110 --> 02:42:14.120 align:start position:0%
too rationale for where I'm going to go
 
02:42:17.230 --> 02:42:17.240 align:start position:0%
on this vote I I agree this needs to go
 
02:42:18.750 --> 02:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
to the floor and we need to have that
 
02:42:21.030 --> 02:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
debate whether it's a half a day or not
 
02:42:27.389 --> 02:42:27.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:30.309 --> 02:42:30.319 align:start position:0%
debate represent Bel thank you Mr chair
 
02:42:32.510 --> 02:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to put forth my two cents
 
02:42:34.590 --> 02:42:34.600 align:start position:0%
here because obviously this very
 
02:42:36.510 --> 02:42:36.520 align:start position:0%
contentious the underlying idea of the
 
02:42:39.590 --> 02:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
bill that's fine but we actually know
 
02:42:41.469 --> 02:42:41.479 align:start position:0%
that the language in the bill is not
 
02:42:43.269 --> 02:42:43.279 align:start position:0%
right and that it actually breaks the
 
02:42:44.990 --> 02:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
existing tax code for a number of our
 
02:42:47.910 --> 02:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
smaller localities out there and I can't
 
02:42:49.309 --> 02:42:49.319 align:start position:0%
think I don't think we can go on any
 
02:42:50.910 --> 02:42:50.920 align:start position:0%
guarantee that this is going to be fixed
 
02:42:52.910 --> 02:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
if we move on to another committee I
 
02:42:54.790 --> 02:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
think this legitimately needs to be
 
02:42:57.030 --> 02:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
studied so it can be fixed so then we
 
02:43:00.790 --> 02:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:03.910 --> 02:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
issue I I believe the underlining issue
 
02:43:06.469 --> 02:43:06.479 align:start position:0%
is are we going to move back to the way
 
02:43:08.750 --> 02:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
the formula was in
 
02:43:12.349 --> 02:43:12.359 align:start position:0%
2008 where the money returns to the
 
02:43:15.030 --> 02:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
state the excess money is not needed for
 
02:43:15.040 --> 02:43:15.790 align:start position:0%
state the excess money is not needed for
ad

02:43:15.790 --> 02:43:15.800 align:start position:0%
ad
 
02:43:18.910 --> 02:43:18.920 align:start position:0%
return and then are redistri distributed
 
02:43:22.429 --> 02:43:22.439 align:start position:0%
to the towns which have that need uh I
 
02:43:24.190 --> 02:43:24.200 align:start position:0%
think that's the primary issue the issue
 
02:43:26.910 --> 02:43:26.920 align:start position:0%
of the negative tax rates I I don't I
 
02:43:28.830 --> 02:43:28.840 align:start position:0%
think it's a very secondary issue in
 
02:43:32.429 --> 02:43:32.439 align:start position:0%
regard to where we are with
 
02:43:37.750 --> 02:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
sweat M Mr chair yes so so thanks and
 
02:43:40.790 --> 02:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
and when we talk about um distribution
 
02:43:43.750 --> 02:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
of of State dollars it could be it could
 
02:43:46.590 --> 02:43:46.600 align:start position:0%
be distributed back to to towns that
 
02:43:50.230 --> 02:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
that um that that had the the collected
 
02:43:51.830 --> 02:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
State Property Tax over and above
 
02:43:53.710 --> 02:43:53.720 align:start position:0%
adequacy maybe in terms of Equitable
 
02:43:56.429 --> 02:43:56.439 align:start position:0%
grants or something like that so so we
 
02:43:58.630 --> 02:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
don't know what that what that you know
 
02:44:01.630 --> 02:44:01.640 align:start position:0%
what the future holds for um uh for
 
02:44:06.389 --> 02:44:06.399 align:start position:0%
school funding but um uh but uh you know
 
02:44:08.630 --> 02:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
I think representative Myer said it it's
 
02:44:10.830 --> 02:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
a it's a state
 
02:44:13.990 --> 02:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
tax represent k scen u just a a
 
02:44:17.190 --> 02:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
procedural question so if we wanted this
 
02:44:19.510 --> 02:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
bill to go to Ways and Means Committee
 
02:44:23.630 --> 02:44:23.640 align:start position:0%
would we have had to approve the
 
02:44:25.990 --> 02:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
OTP and that's the only way we can move
 
02:44:28.790 --> 02:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
it to a way of mean well if you're going
 
02:44:31.950 --> 02:44:31.960 align:start position:0%
to have it has to pass on the floor if
 
02:44:33.070 --> 02:44:33.080 align:start position:0%
it's going to have to come out with an
 
02:44:35.190 --> 02:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
OTP on the floor okay right now it's
 
02:44:37.070 --> 02:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
going on with no recommendation so we'll
 
02:44:38.830 --> 02:44:38.840 align:start position:0%
have that no recommendation debate on
 
02:44:41.950 --> 02:44:41.960 align:start position:0%
the floor yes on the floor have so if we
 
02:44:43.870 --> 02:44:43.880 align:start position:0%
had voted
 
02:44:47.670 --> 02:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
OTP with the thought of it moving to
 
02:44:49.870 --> 02:44:49.880 align:start position:0%
committee would that have prevented the
 
02:44:53.469 --> 02:44:53.479 align:start position:0%
floor debate no no not necessarily no
 
02:44:56.469 --> 02:44:56.479 align:start position:0%
okay thanks and and and the floor debate
 
02:44:58.750 --> 02:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
on the house is going to involve many
 
02:45:00.349 --> 02:45:00.359 align:start position:0%
more people
 
02:45:03.429 --> 02:45:03.439 align:start position:0%
engaging in this debate for example
 
02:45:04.269 --> 02:45:04.279 align:start position:0%
you're going to have the crew from
 
02:45:08.790 --> 02:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:08.800 --> 02:45:11.389 align:start position:0%
 
involved

02:45:11.389 --> 02:45:11.399 align:start position:0%
involved
 
02:45:14.469 --> 02:45:14.479 align:start position:0%
yeah so we have a motion of interim
 
02:45:17.670 --> 02:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
study in front of us any more discussion
 
02:45:20.269 --> 02:45:20.279 align:start position:0%
on the inter room
 
02:45:23.150 --> 02:45:23.160 align:start position:0%

no uh five y 15
 
02:46:15.790 --> 02:46:15.800 align:start position:0%
days so we end up with no recommend
 
02:46:18.710 --> 02:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
foundation and that's where we
 
02:46:21.670 --> 02:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
be so
 
02:46:26.469 --> 02:46:26.479 align:start position:0%
um I guess uh who's going to be doing
 
02:46:30.349 --> 02:46:30.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:32.630 --> 02:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
the yeah the chair and vice chair
 
02:46:33.950 --> 02:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
fighting each other out in the floor
 
02:46:35.110 --> 02:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
that doesn't look good you don't I was
 
02:46:37.150 --> 02:46:37.160 align:start position:0%
gonna say you don't want to do that no
 
02:46:39.710 --> 02:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
no no so I'll probably pass it off to
 
02:46:42.710 --> 02:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
somebody else um but at any rate that's
 
02:46:46.230 --> 02:46:46.240 align:start position:0%
where we are so we'll have two reports
 
02:46:48.429 --> 02:46:48.439 align:start position:0%
now we have one other bill we can either
 
02:46:51.750 --> 02:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
do it now or wait and do it after lunch
 
02:46:54.510 --> 02:46:54.520 align:start position:0%
and pass I don't I'm looking at the
 
02:46:56.870 --> 02:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
bills which we did
 
02:46:59.349 --> 02:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
yesterday and most of them we were
 
02:47:01.590 --> 02:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
holding for further information I think
 
02:47:03.550 --> 02:47:03.560 align:start position:0%
all of them that are remain we're
 
02:47:05.070 --> 02:47:05.080 align:start position:0%
looking for more
 
02:47:08.110 --> 02:47:08.120 align:start position:0%
information so what we'd have then today
 
02:47:10.830 --> 02:47:10.840 align:start position:0%
is simply uh
 
02:47:14.349 --> 02:47:14.359 align:start position:0%
1288 and I don't think I'm prepared to
 
02:47:16.910 --> 02:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
take up 1305 at this time the freedom of
 
02:47:18.070 --> 02:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
speech and
 
02:47:23.190 --> 02:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:28.550 --> 02:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
bill so did we do all our early b no no
 
02:47:31.070 --> 02:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
we have not we have
 
02:47:34.230 --> 02:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
1288 yeah left and what the question is
 
02:47:37.750 --> 02:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
do we that's the only remaining bill
 
02:47:37.760 --> 02:47:38.550 align:start position:0%
do we that's the only remaining bill
that's

02:47:38.550 --> 02:47:38.560 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:47:41.150 --> 02:47:41.160 align:start position:0%

today so there's no time to spare so if
 
03:39:41.189 --> 03:39:41.199 align:start position:0%
you're in
 
03:39:44.030 --> 03:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
L to write a report it's got to be done
 
03:39:48.550 --> 03:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:48.560 --> 03:39:53.030 align:start position:0%
 
immediately

03:39:53.030 --> 03:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:55.870 --> 03:39:55.880 align:start position:0%
okay and that includes anybody that's
 
03:39:58.150 --> 03:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
not done a report from
 
03:40:01.590 --> 03:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
yesterday's business uh I do have a
 
03:40:03.550 --> 03:40:03.560 align:start position:0%
checklist for those that I've not
 
03:40:05.070 --> 03:40:05.080 align:start position:0%
received something but I need to have
 
03:40:05.080 --> 03:40:06.070 align:start position:0%
received something but I need to have
that

03:40:06.070 --> 03:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:40:08.710 --> 03:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
done so we got to get that into the
 
03:40:11.950 --> 03:40:11.960 align:start position:0%
calendar as well
 
03:40:13.830 --> 03:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
you anything before
 
03:40:18.269 --> 03:40:18.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:21.150 --> 03:40:21.160 align:start position:0%
up if if you haven't gotten it to me I I
 
03:40:23.309 --> 03:40:23.319 align:start position:0%
will let you know okay good because I
 
03:40:24.990 --> 03:40:25.000 align:start position:0%
think I'm correct but I don't I think
 
03:40:27.229 --> 03:40:27.239 align:start position:0%
you are but I'll let you know I'll look
 
03:40:38.790 --> 03:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:42.110 --> 03:40:42.120 align:start position:0%
here and and by the way for that means
 
03:40:44.429 --> 03:40:44.439 align:start position:0%
that the people upstairs have to have
 
03:40:46.429 --> 03:40:46.439 align:start position:0%
this already by 3:30 that means they
 
03:40:48.910 --> 03:40:48.920 align:start position:0%
have to transcribe all this stuff so it
 
03:40:50.910 --> 03:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
really has to be gotten to me right off
 
03:40:54.070 --> 03:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
the that here we're really under a
 
03:40:54.080 --> 03:40:58.070 align:start position:0%
the that here we're really under a
timeline

03:40:58.070 --> 03:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:58.080 --> 03:41:00.830 align:start position:0%

here
 
03:41:03.790 --> 03:41:03.800 align:start position:0%

cordelli represent
 
03:44:19.149 --> 03:44:19.159 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you Mr chair so uh based
 
03:44:22.790 --> 03:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
on uh some legitimate uh issues that
 
03:44:25.349 --> 03:44:25.359 align:start position:0%
were brought up during the hearing we
 
03:44:28.710 --> 03:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
have made a number of changes to uh
 
03:44:33.349 --> 03:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
adjust this bill let's walk through and
 
03:44:35.910 --> 03:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
highlight some of these so in the first
 
03:44:38.670 --> 03:44:38.680 align:start position:0%
part under disciplinary proceeding um
 
03:44:40.349 --> 03:44:40.359 align:start position:0%
we've removed
 
03:44:40.359 --> 03:44:41.870 align:start position:0%
we've removed
um

03:44:41.870 --> 03:44:41.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:46.590 --> 03:44:46.600 align:start position:0%
reprimand from the uh the definition
 
03:44:48.830 --> 03:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
there was concern that that was too low
 
03:44:51.469 --> 03:44:51.479 align:start position:0%
a level at which to initiate due process
 
03:44:52.910 --> 03:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
protections and we tend to agree with
 
03:44:55.389 --> 03:44:55.399 align:start position:0%
that it would leave too much open so we
 
03:44:57.469 --> 03:44:57.479 align:start position:0%
simply remove that so it's only when
 
03:45:00.910 --> 03:45:00.920 align:start position:0%
there is movement to take action against
 
03:45:03.510 --> 03:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
um a covered person that due process
 
03:45:07.269 --> 03:45:07.279 align:start position:0%
protections would then um be
 
03:45:12.269 --> 03:45:12.279 align:start position:0%
applied uh on line nine we have added
 
03:45:14.469 --> 03:45:14.479 align:start position:0%
the definition of a criminal allegation
 
03:45:16.510 --> 03:45:16.520 align:start position:0%
which will come into play we'll I'll
 
03:45:18.469 --> 03:45:18.479 align:start position:0%
describe on the next page exactly how
 
03:45:20.309 --> 03:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
that comes into play
 
03:45:27.389 --> 03:45:27.399 align:start position:0%
later um we have removed the um the
 
03:45:30.550 --> 03:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
probationary status from the definition
 
03:45:32.030 --> 03:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
under faculty
 
03:45:34.710 --> 03:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
member um to make sure that this applies
 
03:45:38.670 --> 03:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:44.070 --> 03:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
equally let's see here no changes in
 
03:45:47.710 --> 03:45:47.720 align:start position:0%
four no changes in five ah six student
 
03:45:50.389 --> 03:45:50.399 align:start position:0%
organization we have made adjustments to
 
03:45:52.469 --> 03:45:52.479 align:start position:0%
make clear that this only applies to
 
03:45:54.389 --> 03:45:54.399 align:start position:0%
student organizations that are in the
 
03:45:56.229 --> 03:45:56.239 align:start position:0%
process of application uh for
 
03:45:58.750 --> 03:45:58.760 align:start position:0%
adjudication or appeal so it would not
 
03:46:01.309 --> 03:46:01.319 align:start position:0%
apply to student organizations that for
 
03:46:03.349 --> 03:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
instance were denied some time ago or
 
03:46:07.349 --> 03:46:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:11.110 --> 03:46:11.120 align:start position:0%
nature we have uh decided to because
 
03:46:12.309 --> 03:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
because there is a significant
 
03:46:14.710 --> 03:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
difference between a professional civil
 
03:46:16.550 --> 03:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
court context and proceedings that
 
03:46:18.790 --> 03:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
happen in a college University we have
 
03:46:23.469 --> 03:46:23.479 align:start position:0%
decided to reverse um in line 26 and 27
 
03:46:28.149 --> 03:46:28.159 align:start position:0%
the right to infer guilt based on
 
03:46:31.590 --> 03:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
remaining silent um we believe that
 
03:46:35.429 --> 03:46:35.439 align:start position:0%
there is no inherent guilt to invoking
 
03:46:36.910 --> 03:46:36.920 align:start position:0%
your right to remain silent if you're
 
03:46:39.309 --> 03:46:39.319 align:start position:0%
accused of something um so you should
 
03:46:40.630 --> 03:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
not they should not be afforded the
 
03:46:45.990 --> 03:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:49.550 --> 03:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
uh and the final change here on the
 
03:46:51.110 --> 03:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
second page of the
 
03:46:54.229 --> 03:46:54.239 align:start position:0%
amendment yeah it it really speaks to
 
03:46:56.990 --> 03:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
some of the issues that we've seen uh
 
03:46:58.750 --> 03:46:58.760 align:start position:0%
both in New Hampshire but also across
 
03:47:03.189 --> 03:47:03.199 align:start position:0%
the country um where proceedings are
 
03:47:05.309 --> 03:47:05.319 align:start position:0%
happening simultaneously in a criminal
 
03:47:06.990 --> 03:47:07.000 align:start position:0%
court and also at a
 
03:47:10.750 --> 03:47:10.760 align:start position:0%
college it causes a lot of difficulty in
 
03:47:12.149 --> 03:47:12.159 align:start position:0%
the entire
 
03:47:14.550 --> 03:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
process uh so we believed it would be
 
03:47:16.550 --> 03:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
best to under circumstances where
 
03:47:19.670 --> 03:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
criminal charges are brought against a
 
03:47:23.870 --> 03:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
student that they be allowed to be
 
03:47:27.070 --> 03:47:27.080 align:start position:0%
adjudicated in the court system first
 
03:47:29.110 --> 03:47:29.120 align:start position:0%
before any movement for adjudication by
 
03:47:30.790 --> 03:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
the college now we don't want to put
 
03:47:31.990 --> 03:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
colleges in a position where they have
 
03:47:34.229 --> 03:47:34.239 align:start position:0%
to wait to take disciplinary out action
 
03:47:37.189 --> 03:47:37.199 align:start position:0%
however so in the meantime based on the
 
03:47:39.189 --> 03:47:39.199 align:start position:0%
probable cause provided by the criminal
 
03:47:41.070 --> 03:47:41.080 align:start position:0%
allegation ation is moving forward
 
03:47:43.510 --> 03:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
colleges can take disciplinary action on
 
03:47:45.990 --> 03:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
a temporary basis until such a time that
 
03:47:48.389 --> 03:47:48.399 align:start position:0%
the criminal allegations are resolved in
 
03:47:50.229 --> 03:47:50.239 align:start position:0%
the Criminal Courts at which point they
 
03:47:51.630 --> 03:47:51.640 align:start position:0%
can make a determination whether or not
 
03:47:53.870 --> 03:47:53.880 align:start position:0%
to move forward with their own
 
03:47:57.469 --> 03:47:57.479 align:start position:0%
college-based um uh process which is
 
03:47:58.550 --> 03:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
essentially the same thing that
 
03:48:00.870 --> 03:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
typically happens with civil lawsuits as
 
03:48:02.229 --> 03:48:02.239 align:start position:0%
well civil lawsuits are typically
 
03:48:04.429 --> 03:48:04.439 align:start position:0%
something that comes after the criminal
 
03:48:06.670 --> 03:48:06.680 align:start position:0%
proceedings have been adjudicated and as
 
03:48:09.510 --> 03:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
a part of this um issue when it comes
 
03:48:11.469 --> 03:48:11.479 align:start position:0%
comes to uh criminal
 
03:48:14.550 --> 03:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
charges um there was serious concern
 
03:48:16.710 --> 03:48:16.720 align:start position:0%
about uh the rules of evidence in a
 
03:48:20.070 --> 03:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
criminal court and um obviously with the
 
03:48:22.189 --> 03:48:22.199 align:start position:0%
with the background of Representative
 
03:48:24.229 --> 03:48:24.239 align:start position:0%
Lynn he he's kind of the expert in the
 
03:48:27.110 --> 03:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
matter so we decided that it would be
 
03:48:30.349 --> 03:48:30.359 align:start position:0%
best to really make clear in this that
 
03:48:32.950 --> 03:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
any adjudication happening at a college
 
03:48:35.030 --> 03:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
through their process cannot be
 
03:48:38.710 --> 03:48:38.720 align:start position:0%
admissible as evidence in a criminal
 
03:48:40.229 --> 03:48:40.239 align:start position:0%
proceeding now what does that mean let's
 
03:48:41.670 --> 03:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
tear into that just a little bit I want
 
03:48:42.950 --> 03:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
to clear up any
 
03:48:46.910 --> 03:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
concerns if a college is in is in
 
03:48:48.870 --> 03:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
proceeding were they're attributing
 
03:48:50.389 --> 03:48:50.399 align:start position:0%
guilt or innocence to somebody for
 
03:48:53.910 --> 03:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
something and there is a line of
 
03:48:58.070 --> 03:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
questioning in which they uh they
 
03:49:00.990 --> 03:49:01.000 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that the party was
 
03:49:03.349 --> 03:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
guilty and then based on that they go
 
03:49:05.550 --> 03:49:05.560 align:start position:0%
ahead and they find them guilty and they
 
03:49:08.550 --> 03:49:08.560 align:start position:0%
move forward with discipline now you
 
03:49:10.710 --> 03:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
would not be bble to admit the finding
 
03:49:14.269 --> 03:49:14.279 align:start position:0%
of guilt in a criminal proceeding but
 
03:49:16.429 --> 03:49:16.439 align:start position:0%
there would be no prohibition on
 
03:49:18.870 --> 03:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
utilizing that same line of
 
03:49:21.990 --> 03:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
questioning that led to the guilty uh
 
03:49:24.830 --> 03:49:24.840 align:start position:0%
verdict in the in a court of law so you
 
03:49:26.910 --> 03:49:26.920 align:start position:0%
can you can pursue the same lines of
 
03:49:30.189 --> 03:49:30.199 align:start position:0%
evidence you just can't admit the
 
03:49:32.790 --> 03:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
findings because they're not up to the
 
03:49:35.469 --> 03:49:35.479 align:start position:0%
level of a civil or Criminal Court when
 
03:49:38.309 --> 03:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
they're when they're being done uh in a
 
03:49:38.319 --> 03:49:40.229 align:start position:0%
they're when they're being done uh in a
college

03:49:40.229 --> 03:49:40.239 align:start position:0%
college
 
03:49:42.750 --> 03:49:42.760 align:start position:0%
and I'll I'll speak more broadly to the
 
03:49:44.630 --> 03:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
entire concept because most of the bill
 
03:49:46.149 --> 03:49:46.159 align:start position:0%
remains Untouched by this amendment most
 
03:49:48.030 --> 03:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
of the bill is still
 
03:49:50.950 --> 03:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
there the the point of this is to make
 
03:49:53.790 --> 03:49:53.800 align:start position:0%
sure that we have basic due proc
 
03:49:56.510 --> 03:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
protections of floor not a ceiling
 
03:49:59.229 --> 03:49:59.239 align:start position:0%
afforded to these persons in college and
 
03:50:02.030 --> 03:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
university systems um I think that's
 
03:50:04.870 --> 03:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
extremely important these things you
 
03:50:06.710 --> 03:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
would think they would be protected
 
03:50:08.870 --> 03:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
based on our constitution our fourth
 
03:50:08.880 --> 03:50:10.189 align:start position:0%
based on our constitution our fourth
amendment

03:50:10.189 --> 03:50:10.199 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:50:12.590 --> 03:50:12.600 align:start position:0%
the right the rights afforded there but
 
03:50:14.870 --> 03:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
that hasn't always always been the case
 
03:50:16.910 --> 03:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
that we have seen so we really want to
 
03:50:19.309 --> 03:50:19.319 align:start position:0%
make it explicit make it clear that your
 
03:50:21.870 --> 03:50:21.880 align:start position:0%
fundamental due process protections do
 
03:50:24.670 --> 03:50:24.680 align:start position:0%
apply when you're being faced with
 
03:50:26.910 --> 03:50:26.920 align:start position:0%
something that could be life-changing
 
03:50:30.229 --> 03:50:30.239 align:start position:0%
some kind of accusation in a college I
 
03:50:33.269 --> 03:50:33.279 align:start position:0%
also want to make clear that while this
 
03:50:38.070 --> 03:50:38.080 align:start position:0%
touches of a a broad variety of subjects
 
03:50:41.149 --> 03:50:41.159 align:start position:0%
it is not specific to to any one subject
 
03:50:43.670 --> 03:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
within the broader field of disciplinary
 
03:50:46.710 --> 03:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
allegations uh this would apply equally
 
03:50:49.790 --> 03:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
to plagiarism or
 
03:50:52.110 --> 03:50:52.120 align:start position:0%
assault if there's going to be action
 
03:50:54.910 --> 03:50:54.920 align:start position:0%
taken it affords due process protections
 
03:50:57.070 --> 03:50:57.080 align:start position:0%
which includes very basic fundamental
 
03:50:59.710 --> 03:50:59.720 align:start position:0%
rights rights that are not just afforded
 
03:51:01.110 --> 03:51:01.120 align:start position:0%
by our constitution but you can go all
 
03:51:02.590 --> 03:51:02.600 align:start position:0%
the way back in history and look at
 
03:51:04.990 --> 03:51:05.000 align:start position:0%
scripture in scripture you will find
 
03:51:07.750 --> 03:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
things like the right to cross-examine
 
03:51:10.469 --> 03:51:10.479 align:start position:0%
and confront Witness or an
 
03:51:14.149 --> 03:51:14.159 align:start position:0%
accuser and we've heard testimony that
 
03:51:15.870 --> 03:51:15.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes those things are not
 
03:51:17.670 --> 03:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily afforded to students
 
03:51:21.309 --> 03:51:21.319 align:start position:0%
currently in New Hampshire colleges uh
 
03:51:24.790 --> 03:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's a fundamentally important
 
03:51:27.070 --> 03:51:27.080 align:start position:0%
concept for the protection of everyone
 
03:51:30.110 --> 03:51:30.120 align:start position:0%
involved and the Very legitimacy of the
 
03:51:33.229 --> 03:51:33.239 align:start position:0%
system itself that we extend these
 
03:51:36.389 --> 03:51:36.399 align:start position:0%
protections to all of these persons
 
03:51:39.550 --> 03:51:39.560 align:start position:0%
faculty and students thank you thank you
 
03:51:44.189 --> 03:51:44.199 align:start position:0%
very much uh representative uh
 
03:51:48.189 --> 03:51:48.199 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you um this bill kind of
 
03:51:51.870 --> 03:51:51.880 align:start position:0%
hit a a nerve with me uh so please
 
03:51:53.990 --> 03:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
excuse the fact that I'm going to
 
03:51:55.790 --> 03:51:55.800 align:start position:0%
probably talk about this a little longer
 
03:52:00.269 --> 03:52:00.279 align:start position:0%
than usual but um I think to to equate
 
03:52:04.189 --> 03:52:04.199 align:start position:0%
plagiarism with sexual assault um is a
 
03:52:06.110 --> 03:52:06.120 align:start position:0%
is a false statement a false
 
03:52:10.389 --> 03:52:10.399 align:start position:0%
equivalency and um this this bill seems
 
03:52:15.349 --> 03:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
to be uh as was spoken by um one of the
 
03:52:19.110 --> 03:52:19.120 align:start position:0%
people that testified um partly due to
 
03:52:21.990 --> 03:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
the fact that you know um during the
 
03:52:25.389 --> 03:52:25.399 align:start position:0%
Trump era certain Title 9 restrictions
 
03:52:28.710 --> 03:52:28.720 align:start position:0%
and and procedures were changed uh that
 
03:52:33.630 --> 03:52:33.640 align:start position:0%
were then um possibly changed back by um
 
03:52:36.309 --> 03:52:36.319 align:start position:0%
President Biden and that this was to
 
03:52:39.269 --> 03:52:39.279 align:start position:0%
offset some of those changes into set
 
03:52:41.950 --> 03:52:41.960 align:start position:0%
into motion um changes that would
 
03:52:44.950 --> 03:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
prevent New Hampshire from instituting
 
03:52:48.349 --> 03:52:48.359 align:start position:0%
those changes when we talk about um
 
03:52:51.110 --> 03:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
sexual assault which is probably the key
 
03:52:54.510 --> 03:52:54.520 align:start position:0%
key case on campus that this uh bill
 
03:52:57.830 --> 03:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
would really interfere with um colleges
 
03:53:00.550 --> 03:53:00.560 align:start position:0%
and and universities all have formal
 
03:53:03.030 --> 03:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
informal procedures for disciplinary
 
03:53:05.510 --> 03:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
procedures for dealing with students on
 
03:53:08.309 --> 03:53:08.319 align:start position:0%
campus and sometimes off- campus and
 
03:53:09.590 --> 03:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
they also have
 
03:53:12.189 --> 03:53:12.199 align:start position:0%
me memorandums of understanding with
 
03:53:15.349 --> 03:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
outside crisis women's crisis groups on
 
03:53:17.469 --> 03:53:17.479 align:start position:0%
how to handle the different um
 
03:53:20.269 --> 03:53:20.279 align:start position:0%
situations that arise but in a sexual
 
03:53:22.510 --> 03:53:22.520 align:start position:0%
assault case and I think you can imagine
 
03:53:25.790 --> 03:53:25.800 align:start position:0%
the even the court system has certain
 
03:53:29.590 --> 03:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
restrictions and procedures that in some
 
03:53:31.830 --> 03:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
way protect the
 
03:53:36.630 --> 03:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
victim um for example uh you know can
 
03:53:39.269 --> 03:53:39.279 align:start position:0%
you imagine having a victim of sexual
 
03:53:43.309 --> 03:53:43.319 align:start position:0%
assault in a disciplinary procedure um
 
03:53:46.910 --> 03:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
having an open campus trial or an open
 
03:53:50.630 --> 03:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
campus um meeting uh where the
 
03:53:53.389 --> 03:53:53.399 align:start position:0%
perpetrator can cross-examine the
 
03:53:56.630 --> 03:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
victim um can you imagine that they're
 
03:53:58.269 --> 03:53:58.279 align:start position:0%
allowed to
 
03:54:01.910 --> 03:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
um uh investigate and
 
03:54:05.389 --> 03:54:05.399 align:start position:0%
um bring up all kinds of uh information
 
03:54:07.870 --> 03:54:07.880 align:start position:0%
maybe in the past that's not allowed on
 
03:54:12.149 --> 03:54:12.159 align:start position:0%
on in a regular court of law um with
 
03:54:15.030 --> 03:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
these procedures um the disciplinary
 
03:54:17.309 --> 03:54:17.319 align:start position:0%
procedures on campus there's always the
 
03:54:19.950 --> 03:54:19.960 align:start position:0%
ability of the person that's being
 
03:54:22.550 --> 03:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
accused of going into the criminal court
 
03:54:24.590 --> 03:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
system and when they're in the criminal
 
03:54:27.830 --> 03:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
court system they have due process and
 
03:54:31.389 --> 03:54:31.399 align:start position:0%
um so I think I think this this bill
 
03:54:34.550 --> 03:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
first of all we don't have any major
 
03:54:36.149 --> 03:54:36.159 align:start position:0%
issues I mean the only issue that we
 
03:54:39.269 --> 03:54:39.279 align:start position:0%
heard the other day was an off-campus
 
03:54:43.630 --> 03:54:43.640 align:start position:0%
fraternity house who had an issue with
 
03:54:46.670 --> 03:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
the local disciplinary system within the
 
03:54:49.990 --> 03:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
University versus the uh people that
 
03:54:51.950 --> 03:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
were surrounding this fraternity house
 
03:54:53.349 --> 03:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
somebody turned them in for having
 
03:54:55.910 --> 03:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
underage drinking on the on the front
 
03:54:59.030 --> 03:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
porch or on the lawn um if that's the
 
03:55:00.950 --> 03:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
only case that we've had in in New
 
03:55:04.510 --> 03:55:04.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's been a problem um that
 
03:55:06.110 --> 03:55:06.120 align:start position:0%
people felt they weren't given due
 
03:55:08.910 --> 03:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
process then I think that's um you know
 
03:55:13.590 --> 03:55:13.600 align:start position:0%
very small um compared to the trauma um
 
03:55:17.110 --> 03:55:17.120 align:start position:0%
I worked on on campus for a while on a
 
03:55:21.349 --> 03:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
campus for a while and actually um saw
 
03:55:24.590 --> 03:55:24.600 align:start position:0%
some of these couple of um assault cases
 
03:55:26.110 --> 03:55:26.120 align:start position:0%
and how they were handled through the
 
03:55:28.469 --> 03:55:28.479 align:start position:0%
disciplinary informal disciplinary
 
03:55:30.870 --> 03:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
action and I think it was for for the
 
03:55:33.429 --> 03:55:33.439 align:start position:0%
best for both the victim and and the
 
03:55:36.630 --> 03:55:36.640 align:start position:0%
person that was accused um and was
 
03:55:39.349 --> 03:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
resolved on campus um
 
03:55:42.750 --> 03:55:42.760 align:start position:0%
somewhere up around 80 or 90% of sexual
 
03:55:46.630 --> 03:55:46.640 align:start position:0%
assaults um on campus are never reported
 
03:55:51.229 --> 03:55:51.239 align:start position:0%
and a few years ago we had a bill that
 
03:55:53.910 --> 03:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
required every sexual assault that was
 
03:55:57.269 --> 03:55:57.279 align:start position:0%
reported either to the health uh place
 
03:55:59.710 --> 03:55:59.720 align:start position:0%
on campus or to the
 
03:56:03.189 --> 03:56:03.199 align:start position:0%
um to the dean had to go through
 
03:56:06.070 --> 03:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
criminal court and we heard from many
 
03:56:09.469 --> 03:56:09.479 align:start position:0%
crisis centers many victims about how
 
03:56:11.349 --> 03:56:11.359 align:start position:0%
traumatic that would be if that was
 
03:56:13.950 --> 03:56:13.960 align:start position:0%
actually put into law because most
 
03:56:16.550 --> 03:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
sexual assault victims do not want to go
 
03:56:21.510 --> 03:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
into the criminal system um so I I just
 
03:56:24.429 --> 03:56:24.439 align:start position:0%
I'm urging you to vote against this bill
 
03:56:26.309 --> 03:56:26.319 align:start position:0%
um I think it will cause all kinds of
 
03:56:30.149 --> 03:56:30.159 align:start position:0%
problems on campus um it it takes away
 
03:56:32.429 --> 03:56:32.439 align:start position:0%
the control that campuses that
 
03:56:34.269 --> 03:56:34.279 align:start position:0%
University Systems
 
03:56:38.710 --> 03:56:38.720 align:start position:0%
have um to to deal with their oncampus
 
03:56:41.269 --> 03:56:41.279 align:start position:0%
issues it would be just like going into
 
03:56:43.469 --> 03:56:43.479 align:start position:0%
the school system and saying you know
 
03:56:46.269 --> 03:56:46.279 align:start position:0%
the way that you you you the process you
 
03:56:49.030 --> 03:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
have dealing with discipline um you know
 
03:56:52.070 --> 03:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
that we're meddling with that um and we
 
03:56:55.149 --> 03:56:55.159 align:start position:0%
only do that in really extreme cases so
 
03:56:58.870 --> 03:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
um there's I've talked to um couple of
 
03:57:01.349 --> 03:57:01.359 align:start position:0%
people that are involved in colleges and
 
03:57:03.750 --> 03:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
they say yes this this in fact would
 
03:57:06.510 --> 03:57:06.520 align:start position:0%
really interrupt and make things very
 
03:57:09.750 --> 03:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
contentious and very um
 
03:57:12.110 --> 03:57:12.120 align:start position:0%
traumatic for victims so I urge you to
 
03:57:14.110 --> 03:57:14.120 align:start position:0%
vote against it thank you further
 
03:57:16.309 --> 03:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
discussion representative cordelli uh
 
03:57:17.910 --> 03:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
thank you I just looking at the
 
03:57:20.590 --> 03:57:20.600 align:start position:0%
amendment I don't see anything in the
 
03:57:23.670 --> 03:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
amendment that would touch on what um
 
03:57:25.550 --> 03:57:25.560 align:start position:0%
the representative was just speaking
 
03:57:32.030 --> 03:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:34.389 --> 03:57:34.399 align:start position:0%
about Prof
 
03:57:37.550 --> 03:57:37.560 align:start position:0%
Miler thank you uh Mr chairman I'm going
 
03:57:39.389 --> 03:57:39.399 align:start position:0%
to vote no on this
 
03:57:41.389 --> 03:57:41.399 align:start position:0%
and I'll reserve my comments when we
 
03:57:43.030 --> 03:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
deal with the main
 
03:57:46.590 --> 03:57:46.600 align:start position:0%
Bill further discussion
 
03:57:48.510 --> 03:57:48.520 align:start position:0%
representer thank you Mr chair I just
 
03:57:49.910 --> 03:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to correct the record because
 
03:57:52.469 --> 03:57:52.479 align:start position:0%
there was a suggestion that um perhaps I
 
03:57:54.830 --> 03:57:54.840 align:start position:0%
equated the concept of plagiarism with
 
03:57:57.910 --> 03:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
sexual assault uh I did no such thing I
 
03:58:01.149 --> 03:58:01.159 align:start position:0%
would never do something like that if
 
03:58:04.229 --> 03:58:04.239 align:start position:0%
you ask me the punishment and by the way
 
03:58:05.910 --> 03:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
this bill does not deal with punishments
 
03:58:09.229 --> 03:58:09.239 align:start position:0%
it only deals with process if you ask me
 
03:58:10.750 --> 03:58:10.760 align:start position:0%
about punishment which is where the
 
03:58:13.070 --> 03:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
equation would be made I would expect
 
03:58:14.870 --> 03:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
plagiarism would be solved with
 
03:58:17.349 --> 03:58:17.359 align:start position:0%
something like a civil penalty I think
 
03:58:19.030 --> 03:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
the death penalty should be instituted
 
03:58:20.830 --> 03:58:20.840 align:start position:0%
for sexual
 
03:58:23.950 --> 03:58:23.960 align:start position:0%
assault that said again this does not
 
03:58:26.189 --> 03:58:26.199 align:start position:0%
deal with punishments it is only about
 
03:58:28.510 --> 03:58:28.520 align:start position:0%
process and while I hold those things to
 
03:58:28.520 --> 03:58:29.830 align:start position:0%
process and while I hold those things to
be

03:58:29.830 --> 03:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:58:32.950 --> 03:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
true I think both persons when accused
 
03:58:34.950 --> 03:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
should receive full due process
 
03:58:37.229 --> 03:58:37.239 align:start position:0%
protection because that is how we as a
 
03:58:39.910 --> 03:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
system as a society as a constitutional
 
03:58:41.950 --> 03:58:41.960 align:start position:0%
republic adjudicate between guilt and
 
03:58:45.429 --> 03:58:45.439 align:start position:0%
innocence we have to give people the
 
03:58:47.429 --> 03:58:47.439 align:start position:0%
chance even if they are accused of
 
03:58:50.070 --> 03:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
something heinous thank you further
 
03:58:52.870 --> 03:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
discussion represent
 
03:58:57.269 --> 03:58:57.279 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you chair um just I'm not
 
03:58:59.630 --> 03:58:59.640 align:start position:0%
disputing um represent of bel's biblical
 
03:59:00.870 --> 03:59:00.880 align:start position:0%
knowledge but I don't know where
 
03:59:02.950 --> 03:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
scripture says you have a right to
 
03:59:05.510 --> 03:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
cross-examine I'm sure you have a a
 
03:59:07.269 --> 03:59:07.279 align:start position:0%
reference to that you can tell me
 
03:59:10.710 --> 03:59:10.720 align:start position:0%
offline um but beyond that uh I have a
 
03:59:12.550 --> 03:59:12.560 align:start position:0%
concern when we looked at the multiple
 
03:59:14.349 --> 03:59:14.359 align:start position:0%
stages here you had the four-year
 
03:59:16.229 --> 03:59:16.239 align:start position:0%
college and universities speaking
 
03:59:18.269 --> 03:59:18.279 align:start position:0%
against this there a two-year College
 
03:59:20.670 --> 03:59:20.680 align:start position:0%
University speaking against this um from
 
03:59:22.149 --> 03:59:22.159 align:start position:0%
the day one and someone as
 
03:59:23.830 --> 03:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
representative Tana said about the
 
03:59:25.469 --> 03:59:25.479 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse issues we had before when
 
03:59:27.349 --> 03:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
the bill came about women who were
 
03:59:28.790 --> 03:59:28.800 align:start position:0%
trying to help particularly women who
 
03:59:31.750 --> 03:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
were trying to help never was not going
 
03:59:33.910 --> 03:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
because they're petrified and then I was
 
03:59:36.429 --> 03:59:36.439 align:start position:0%
looking at the amendment which I uh my
 
03:59:38.590 --> 03:59:38.600 align:start position:0%
associate here let me to look at uh and
 
03:59:41.750 --> 03:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
I I still see under one I think it's I
 
03:59:43.950 --> 03:59:43.960 align:start position:0%
uh the right to the list for five days
 
03:59:46.110 --> 03:59:46.120 align:start position:0%
you Witnesses the whole thing I see this
 
03:59:48.750 --> 03:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
is is I understand the procedural piece
 
03:59:52.790 --> 03:59:52.800 align:start position:0%
but I see it really as um being uh a
 
03:59:54.750 --> 03:59:54.760 align:start position:0%
limitation I understand the procedure
 
03:59:56.510 --> 03:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
but it seem a limitation for women
 
03:59:57.830 --> 03:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
particularly and as a father of a
 
03:59:59.590 --> 03:59:59.600 align:start position:0%
daughter the last thing I want to do is
 
04:00:02.469 --> 04:00:02.479 align:start position:0%
put Road M road blocks in her way uh for
 
04:00:03.710 --> 04:00:03.720 align:start position:0%
her to bring something forward if it
 
04:00:06.510 --> 04:00:06.520 align:start position:0%
happens so I I I just think this is way
 
04:00:08.510 --> 04:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
over for what we need I think the colle
 
04:00:09.670 --> 04:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire anyhow have been
 
04:00:13.189 --> 04:00:13.199 align:start position:0%
handling it relatively well um uh and we
 
04:00:14.710 --> 04:00:14.720 align:start position:0%
heard we've heard very little if any
 
04:00:16.510 --> 04:00:16.520 align:start position:0%
complaints about the structure between
 
04:00:18.030 --> 04:00:18.040 align:start position:0%
the four-year college and the two-year
 
04:00:20.070 --> 04:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
colleges understanding of course that
 
04:00:21.590 --> 04:00:21.600 align:start position:0%
two-ear college a lot younger youngsters
 
04:00:24.550 --> 04:00:24.560 align:start position:0%
of students uh I I just uh I think this
 
04:00:27.870 --> 04:00:27.880 align:start position:0%
is over the top of what we need like a
 
04:00:28.950 --> 04:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
road we don't need to go down right now
 
04:00:30.269 --> 04:00:30.279 align:start position:0%
because things there's not an issue to
 
04:00:32.750 --> 04:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
be solved thank you Mr chair you're
 
04:00:32.760 --> 04:00:36.710 align:start position:0%
be solved thank you Mr chair you're
welcome

04:00:36.710 --> 04:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:39.269 --> 04:00:39.279 align:start position:0%
Rus I know this this bill doesn't
 
04:00:41.349 --> 04:00:41.359 align:start position:0%
actually say anything about having to
 
04:00:44.750 --> 04:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
report or any of that which was part of
 
04:00:47.229 --> 04:00:47.239 align:start position:0%
what rep Tanner was talking about it
 
04:00:50.110 --> 04:00:50.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't do that it just says
 
04:00:54.590 --> 04:00:54.600 align:start position:0%
if it's ended up in the system so if
 
04:00:56.910 --> 04:00:56.920 align:start position:0%
somebody's reported it if they're going
 
04:00:58.670 --> 04:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
through this is the process that needs
 
04:01:02.030 --> 04:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
to be followed it doesn't say that the
 
04:01:06.950 --> 04:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
person the the um victim has to report
 
04:01:09.309 --> 04:01:09.319 align:start position:0%
anything to begin
 
04:01:13.710 --> 04:01:13.720 align:start position:0%
with just if it ends up in the criminal
 
04:01:17.110 --> 04:01:17.120 align:start position:0%
system or in or gets reported and they
 
04:01:19.750 --> 04:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
are dealing with it this is a process
 
04:01:23.269 --> 04:01:23.279 align:start position:0%
that you need to follow and um the other
 
04:01:26.269 --> 04:01:26.279 align:start position:0%
thing saying cross-examine does not
 
04:01:29.990 --> 04:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean that the individual is
 
04:01:32.590 --> 04:01:32.600 align:start position:0%
cross-examining often or usually what
 
04:01:35.030 --> 04:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
happens in court is their lawyer and
 
04:01:37.349 --> 04:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
their lawyer knows what can and can't be
 
04:01:37.359 --> 04:01:39.830 align:start position:0%
their lawyer knows what can and can't be
said

04:01:39.830 --> 04:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
said
 
04:01:42.229 --> 04:01:42.239 align:start position:0%
that's all further discussion
 
04:01:42.239 --> 04:01:43.590 align:start position:0%
that's all further discussion

04:02:26.670 --> 04:02:26.680 align:start position:0%
it goes to the the criminal court is
 
04:02:26.680 --> 04:02:27.870 align:start position:0%
it goes to the the criminal court is
running

04:02:27.870 --> 04:02:27.880 align:start position:0%
running
 
04:02:29.710 --> 04:02:29.720 align:start position:0%
simultaneously and then after the
 
04:02:32.309 --> 04:02:32.319 align:start position:0%
criminal court the college may do
 
04:02:34.910 --> 04:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
something else is that that is that sort
 
04:02:37.910 --> 04:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
of Bic what you said yes if I may so if
 
04:02:41.349 --> 04:02:41.359 align:start position:0%
for for instance a student is accused of
 
04:02:43.950 --> 04:02:43.960 align:start position:0%
assault and there is a criminal charge
 
04:02:46.790 --> 04:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
brought based on that um they could go
 
04:02:48.550 --> 04:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
forward with the criminal charges based
 
04:02:50.790 --> 04:02:50.800 align:start position:0%
on the probable cause provided by that
 
04:02:52.189 --> 04:02:52.199 align:start position:0%
the college could then Institute
 
04:02:53.710 --> 04:02:53.720 align:start position:0%
whatever whatever punishment they feel
 
04:02:56.389 --> 04:02:56.399 align:start position:0%
fitting for that offense on a temporary
 
04:02:58.070 --> 04:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
basis until the criminal charges are
 
04:03:00.349 --> 04:03:00.359 align:start position:0%
resolved at which case they could
 
04:03:02.429 --> 04:03:02.439 align:start position:0%
determine to move forward with their
 
04:03:05.110 --> 04:03:05.120 align:start position:0%
process I made fall yes so so that's
 
04:03:07.750 --> 04:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
what I thought it said so my concern is
 
04:03:10.189 --> 04:03:10.199 align:start position:0%
um I'm accused of doing something it
 
04:03:12.070 --> 04:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
goes to the criminal court and the call
 
04:03:14.070 --> 04:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
says you know what boy if we're going to
 
04:03:16.229 --> 04:03:16.239 align:start position:0%
court we got to stand here be more
 
04:03:18.030 --> 04:03:18.040 align:start position:0%
conservative I think we're just going to
 
04:03:20.309 --> 04:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
temporarily suspend you because we don't
 
04:03:22.229 --> 04:03:22.239 align:start position:0%
dare have you here because you go to
 
04:03:24.189 --> 04:03:24.199 align:start position:0%
court on this um and then you get the
 
04:03:25.830 --> 04:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
court and you find out yep nope this was
 
04:03:27.510 --> 04:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
an error it was an argument we had
 
04:03:29.110 --> 04:03:29.120 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with anything but this
 
04:03:31.189 --> 04:03:31.199 align:start position:0%
youngster has already been suspended or
 
04:03:34.550 --> 04:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
miss school or whatever uh for how long
 
04:03:36.389 --> 04:03:36.399 align:start position:0%
a time it could be and and most things
 
04:03:37.630 --> 04:03:37.640 align:start position:0%
in in the state of New Hampshire court
 
04:03:40.229 --> 04:03:40.239 align:start position:0%
process seem to be extremely slow ver
 
04:03:42.349 --> 04:03:42.359 align:start position:0%
fast but this could take a long good
 
04:03:44.790 --> 04:03:44.800 align:start position:0%
semester to get this resolved so a
 
04:03:47.469 --> 04:03:47.479 align:start position:0%
student a parent the family are all set
 
04:03:52.309 --> 04:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
aside waiting for for a distri for a uh
 
04:03:54.349 --> 04:03:54.359 align:start position:0%
opinion from the court and then you
 
04:03:55.910 --> 04:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
can't go back and fix something when
 
04:03:57.550 --> 04:03:57.560 align:start position:0%
they're already out of the gate so I I
 
04:03:58.870 --> 04:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
think that I understand what you're
 
04:04:01.309 --> 04:04:01.319 align:start position:0%
saying so you're not Double Jeopardy is
 
04:04:03.910 --> 04:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
type I just feel it's really really
 
04:04:06.510 --> 04:04:06.520 align:start position:0%
negatively impacts the student and the
 
04:04:08.309 --> 04:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
family well why is Johnny home I Valley
 
04:04:10.229 --> 04:04:10.239 align:start position:0%
home or because the school suspended and
 
04:04:14.070 --> 04:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
because maybe and then oh he's not it's
 
04:04:16.950 --> 04:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
like you see someone in the newspaper
 
04:04:18.670 --> 04:04:18.680 align:start position:0%
there's never a not you if it isn't that
 
04:04:20.189 --> 04:04:20.199 align:start position:0%
small two months
 
04:04:23.149 --> 04:04:23.159 align:start position:0%
later thank you Mr chair I'm done if I
 
04:04:24.910 --> 04:04:24.920 align:start position:0%
if I may respond because I think I can I
 
04:04:27.149 --> 04:04:27.159 align:start position:0%
can speak to that um you thought were
 
04:04:29.070 --> 04:04:29.080 align:start position:0%
saying yes so you can
 
04:04:33.149 --> 04:04:33.159 align:start position:0%
wait if I may I I'll respond to that
 
04:04:35.910 --> 04:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
so there's no perfect solution and
 
04:04:38.189 --> 04:04:38.199 align:start position:0%
that's why we have this uh this system
 
04:04:40.229 --> 04:04:40.239 align:start position:0%
of due process in the first place but
 
04:04:41.830 --> 04:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
what what I can say is regarding
 
04:04:44.510 --> 04:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
criminal charges um if criminal charges
 
04:04:45.910 --> 04:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
are to be brought first of all there has
 
04:04:47.149 --> 04:04:47.159 align:start position:0%
to be an arrest and arrest has to be
 
04:04:48.750 --> 04:04:48.760 align:start position:0%
based on Reasonable articulable
 
04:04:51.309 --> 04:04:51.319 align:start position:0%
Suspicion and probable cause then if
 
04:04:52.670 --> 04:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
charges are going to be brought within
 
04:04:55.070 --> 04:04:55.080 align:start position:0%
the prosecutor's code of ethics they
 
04:04:57.670 --> 04:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
have to have a reasonable belief that
 
04:05:00.710 --> 04:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
they can get a guilty verdict on that so
 
04:05:03.550 --> 04:05:03.560 align:start position:0%
it's not perfect but it's good and it's
 
04:05:04.710 --> 04:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
much better than what's currently in
 
04:05:08.790 --> 04:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
place thank further discussion
 
04:05:08.800 --> 04:05:09.950 align:start position:0%
place thank further discussion
represent

04:05:09.950 --> 04:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
represent
 
04:05:12.870 --> 04:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
Hanner yes I I would um just want to
 
04:05:15.830 --> 04:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
respond to representative lakis that the
 
04:05:18.229 --> 04:05:18.239 align:start position:0%
disciplinary procedures usually within a
 
04:05:21.070 --> 04:05:21.080 align:start position:0%
college they're informal so there's not
 
04:05:23.630 --> 04:05:23.640 align:start position:0%
lawyers present and you're right in a in
 
04:05:27.590 --> 04:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
a court of law a prosecutor or a defense
 
04:05:29.550 --> 04:05:29.560 align:start position:0%
lawyer would know the rules and there
 
04:05:32.429 --> 04:05:32.439 align:start position:0%
are rules and the process is different
 
04:05:35.349 --> 04:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
for sexual assault than it is for
 
04:05:36.990 --> 04:05:37.000 align:start position:0%
everything else and under this
 
04:05:39.830 --> 04:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
particular bill and maybe representative
 
04:05:43.630 --> 04:05:43.640 align:start position:0%
belter can correct me but um the accuser
 
04:05:45.229 --> 04:05:45.239 align:start position:0%
would be able to do the
 
04:05:47.710 --> 04:05:47.720 align:start position:0%
cross-examination and and be able to
 
04:05:52.830 --> 04:05:52.840 align:start position:0%
face um his his victim or her
 
04:05:56.429 --> 04:05:56.439 align:start position:0%
victim thank you I if I'm rep on Miler
 
04:05:59.189 --> 04:05:59.199 align:start position:0%
and then may I remind the committee we
 
04:06:01.590 --> 04:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
are focused on the amendment yes we are
 
04:06:05.550 --> 04:06:05.560 align:start position:0%
not dealing with the bill yet is the
 
04:06:08.710 --> 04:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you represent belshire
 
04:06:10.990 --> 04:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and just to speak to that um
 
04:06:13.550 --> 04:06:13.560 align:start position:0%
the the answer is the answer is yes uh
 
04:06:16.269 --> 04:06:16.279 align:start position:0%
the accused would be able to but that's
 
04:06:18.790 --> 04:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
no different from a court of law when a
 
04:06:21.910 --> 04:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
person can choose to defend themselves
 
04:06:24.269 --> 04:06:24.279 align:start position:0%
rather than having an attorney in this
 
04:06:26.110 --> 04:06:26.120 align:start position:0%
case they could also choose to have an
 
04:06:28.590 --> 04:06:28.600 align:start position:0%
attorney who would go forward and based
 
04:06:30.830 --> 04:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
on the information uh Prov you provided
 
04:06:32.950 --> 04:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
me earlier I can say that the people
 
04:06:35.349 --> 04:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
involved in the uh adjudication process
 
04:06:37.830 --> 04:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
themselves have to be trained according
 
04:06:40.830 --> 04:06:40.840 align:start position:0%
to Title 9 which means they are trained
 
04:06:43.389 --> 04:06:43.399 align:start position:0%
on adjudication and just like in in a j
 
04:06:46.950 --> 04:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
just a court a judge would keep the
 
04:06:50.030 --> 04:06:50.040 align:start position:0%
either defendant or or his attorney in
 
04:06:52.910 --> 04:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
line when conducting a cross-examination
 
04:06:56.229 --> 04:06:56.239 align:start position:0%
that that same thing could be in place
 
04:06:58.550 --> 04:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
here represent
 
04:07:01.550 --> 04:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
dry thank you
 
04:07:04.510 --> 04:07:04.520 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot here that I and I may
 
04:07:06.229 --> 04:07:06.239 align:start position:0%
have missed something but in the
 
04:07:08.149 --> 04:07:08.159 align:start position:0%
University system of New Hampshire's
 
04:07:10.630 --> 04:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
notes at the end of the fiscal note it
 
04:07:12.590 --> 04:07:12.600 align:start position:0%
talked about the statute would pertain
 
04:07:14.269 --> 04:07:14.279 align:start position:0%
to all proceedings and it said quote
 
04:07:16.429 --> 04:07:16.439 align:start position:0%
that could result in a reprimand and I
 
04:07:19.429 --> 04:07:19.439 align:start position:0%
can't find that quote in the bill but
 
04:07:22.189 --> 04:07:22.199 align:start position:0%
does this amendment take care of their
 
04:07:24.590 --> 04:07:24.600 align:start position:0%
concern yes thank you that reprimand was
 
04:07:27.710 --> 04:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
removed it's no longer part of
 
04:07:30.990 --> 04:07:31.000 align:start position:0%

chair I hope the committee can bear with
 
04:08:54.269 --> 04:08:54.279 align:start position:0%
me a little bit because I've got some
 
04:08:58.229 --> 04:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:01.950 --> 04:09:01.960 align:start position:0%
bill did you want to make a motion yes

04:09:08.189 --> 04:09:08.199 align:start position:0%
bill no no wait a minute wait no there
 
04:09:10.590 --> 04:09:10.600 align:start position:0%

04:09:13.910 --> 04:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
have an OTP okay there ISP right yes
 
04:09:17.550 --> 04:09:17.560 align:start position:0%
sorry sorry it's okay okay that's okay
 
04:09:20.670 --> 04:09:20.680 align:start position:0%
okay so I've got several issues here
 
04:09:24.590 --> 04:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
first of all this includes
 
04:09:26.990 --> 04:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
faculty now I recognize that there may
 
04:09:29.870 --> 04:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
be some faculty that aren't
 
04:09:32.830 --> 04:09:32.840 align:start position:0%
unionized but we noted in the testimony
 
04:09:35.590 --> 04:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
that in at UNH there are four
 
04:09:38.229 --> 04:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
unions at uh
 
04:09:41.149 --> 04:09:41.159 align:start position:0%
the Community College there three
 
04:09:43.630 --> 04:09:43.640 align:start position:0%
unions now you need to realize that
 
04:09:46.070 --> 04:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
these Collective bargain agreements
 
04:09:47.750 --> 04:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
basically set out the standards of
 
04:09:52.510 --> 04:09:52.520 align:start position:0%
behavior and the standards of uh of work
 
04:09:55.389 --> 04:09:55.399 align:start position:0%
in those collective bargaining units and
 
04:09:57.790 --> 04:09:57.800 align:start position:0%
believe me I've negotiated these units
 
04:10:00.870 --> 04:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
of you negotiated grievance procedures
 
04:10:03.030 --> 04:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
which basically sets out the due process
 
04:10:05.870 --> 04:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
part so let me explain to you exactly
 
04:10:07.790 --> 04:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
for those of you that have not been in a
 
04:10:09.469 --> 04:10:09.479 align:start position:0%
environment let me explain what that
 
04:10:09.479 --> 04:10:10.510 align:start position:0%
environment let me explain what that
process

04:10:10.510 --> 04:10:10.520 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:10:13.510 --> 04:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
is an employee has a right for due
 
04:10:16.349 --> 04:10:16.359 align:start position:0%
process if they think they've been uh if
 
04:10:18.229 --> 04:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
the contract has been
 
04:10:20.469 --> 04:10:20.479 align:start position:0%
violated what that means is that the
 
04:10:23.510 --> 04:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
employee brings forth to management and
 
04:10:25.149 --> 04:10:25.159 align:start position:0%
believe me I've been a union rep and
 
04:10:28.269 --> 04:10:28.279 align:start position:0%
I've been management I've had it on both
 
04:10:30.590 --> 04:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
sides you bring the issue before
 
04:10:32.189 --> 04:10:32.199 align:start position:0%
management you try to talk it out and
 
04:10:33.349 --> 04:10:33.359 align:start position:0%
say Here's the
 
04:10:37.070 --> 04:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
issues can we resolve this and in most
 
04:10:40.309 --> 04:10:40.319 align:start position:0%
cases it's resolved at that conversation
 
04:10:43.070 --> 04:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
level if the employee is not satisfied
 
04:10:45.269 --> 04:10:45.279 align:start position:0%
with that conversation level and
 
04:10:47.309 --> 04:10:47.319 align:start position:0%
official grievance is filed a written
 
04:10:49.750 --> 04:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
grievance is filed stating exactly what
 
04:10:52.389 --> 04:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
the problem is at that point in time
 
04:10:54.389 --> 04:10:54.399 align:start position:0%
there's a formal hearing between labor
 
04:10:57.429 --> 04:10:57.439 align:start position:0%
and management again to try to resolve
 
04:11:01.269 --> 04:11:01.279 align:start position:0%
it if it's not if it's resolved terrific
 
04:11:04.349 --> 04:11:04.359 align:start position:0%
if it's not resolved in most cases at
 
04:11:05.990 --> 04:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
least the ones that I've negotiate
 
04:11:08.070 --> 04:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
there's a binding arbitration that goes
 
04:11:10.309 --> 04:11:10.319 align:start position:0%
forward at that point in time it goes
 
04:11:13.109 --> 04:11:13.119 align:start position:0%
before a neutral third party both sides
 
04:11:15.189 --> 04:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
present their issues and a binding
 
04:11:18.070 --> 04:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
decision is made in the
 
04:11:21.070 --> 04:11:21.080 align:start position:0%
conversation that's the due process that
 
04:11:23.830 --> 04:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
employees have at this point in
 
04:11:26.910 --> 04:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
time seven different unions we were
 
04:11:30.030 --> 04:11:30.040 align:start position:0%
noted in the in the in the testimony
 
04:11:32.429 --> 04:11:32.439 align:start position:0%
covers Union
 
04:11:32.439 --> 04:11:35.870 align:start position:0%
covers Union
employees

04:11:35.870 --> 04:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:38.510 --> 04:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
next everyone that that was in the room
 
04:11:41.030 --> 04:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
and I think everybody in this room now
 
04:11:43.269 --> 04:11:43.279 align:start position:0%
on the committee believes in in the
 
04:11:44.830 --> 04:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
issue of due
 
04:11:48.109 --> 04:11:48.119 align:start position:0%
process both UNH and the community
 
04:11:51.950 --> 04:11:51.960 align:start position:0%
college system provided a detailed
 
04:11:54.950 --> 04:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
analysis of their due process for
 
04:11:57.149 --> 04:11:57.159 align:start position:0%
students whether it be in the handbook
 
04:11:58.550 --> 04:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
whether it be in the code of conduct
 
04:12:01.950 --> 04:12:01.960 align:start position:0%
whether it be in the uh the the um
 
04:12:04.910 --> 04:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
employee handbook there's a they laid
 
04:12:09.469 --> 04:12:09.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:14.149 --> 04:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
the UN said that uh the the um UNH said
 
04:12:17.109 --> 04:12:17.119 align:start position:0%
that they had 3,000 issues brought
 
04:12:18.870 --> 04:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
before them last
 
04:12:22.950 --> 04:12:22.960 align:start position:0%
year all but 80 were
 
04:12:25.950 --> 04:12:25.960 align:start position:0%
resolved all but 80 were
 
04:12:30.510 --> 04:12:30.520 align:start position:0%
resolved so the process that they have
 
04:12:34.790 --> 04:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
Works finally I like to say I asked the
 
04:12:36.469 --> 04:12:36.479 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of this bill you may
 
04:12:38.790 --> 04:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
remember I asked where' this come from
 
04:12:40.790 --> 04:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
I'm always interested what the intent of
 
04:12:42.189 --> 04:12:42.199 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:12:45.389 --> 04:12:45.399 align:start position:0%
is and I believe if I you can correct me
 
04:12:47.510 --> 04:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong but I think the prime
 
04:12:50.830 --> 04:12:50.840 align:start position:0%
sponsor said well you know we got issues
 
04:12:52.910 --> 04:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
nationally he might have mentioned woke
 
04:12:54.269 --> 04:12:54.279 align:start position:0%
he might have mentioned some cultural
 
04:12:56.630 --> 04:12:56.640 align:start position:0%
issues we got issues nationally I said
 
04:12:59.269 --> 04:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
but what's happening in this state what
 
04:13:01.670 --> 04:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
are the problems in this state and what
 
04:13:02.790 --> 04:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
was his
 
04:13:05.469 --> 04:13:05.479 align:start position:0%
response he didn't know any
 
04:13:08.990 --> 04:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
of so why is this bill before
 
04:13:12.149 --> 04:13:12.159 align:start position:0%
us we've got the procedures already out
 
04:13:12.159 --> 04:13:13.429 align:start position:0%
us we've got the procedures already out
there

04:13:13.429 --> 04:13:13.439 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:13:15.510 --> 04:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
folks when you're dealing with a
 
04:13:17.710 --> 04:13:17.720 align:start position:0%
community like a higher education I'll
 
04:13:20.309 --> 04:13:20.319 align:start position:0%
just de with higher education here you
 
04:13:21.870 --> 04:13:21.880 align:start position:0%
try to create a collaborative
 
04:13:24.670 --> 04:13:24.680 align:start position:0%
environment to resolve these
 
04:13:27.590 --> 04:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
issues this bill immediately moves it
 
04:13:30.910 --> 04:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:32.950 --> 04:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
situation and I don't think that's
 
04:13:34.990 --> 04:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
healthy in a community now now should
 
04:13:37.149 --> 04:13:37.159 align:start position:0%
students have their rights their due
 
04:13:38.950 --> 04:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
process rights
 
04:13:42.510 --> 04:13:42.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely but I believe that currently
 
04:13:44.189 --> 04:13:44.199 align:start position:0%
the systems that are in place we've been
 
04:13:46.309 --> 04:13:46.319 align:start position:0%
over this
 
04:13:48.790 --> 04:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
before the systems that are in place
 
04:13:51.670 --> 04:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
provide that opportunity to take place
 
04:13:55.189 --> 04:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
this is a bill looking for a
 
04:13:57.790 --> 04:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
problem now one final
 
04:14:00.429 --> 04:14:00.439 align:start position:0%
say maybe I shouldn't say this but I'm
 
04:14:03.990 --> 04:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
hyped up so I might as well go for it I
 
04:14:06.149 --> 04:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
will there's been some biblical
 
04:14:09.269 --> 04:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:12.149 --> 04:14:12.159 align:start position:0%
now for some of you the biblical
 
04:14:14.750 --> 04:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
statements are
 
04:14:19.030 --> 04:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
dicta for some of us it's a fictional
 
04:14:22.349 --> 04:14:22.359 align:start position:0%
story so I would refer I would prefer
 
04:14:26.349 --> 04:14:26.359 align:start position:0%
for my values that we don't make those
 
04:14:28.630 --> 04:14:28.640 align:start position:0%
again because they what we're dealing
 
04:14:31.149 --> 04:14:31.159 align:start position:0%
with here are procedures that are
 
04:14:33.189 --> 04:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
established procedures that have been
 
04:14:37.189 --> 04:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
worked that have been fine honed that
 
04:14:39.229 --> 04:14:39.239 align:start position:0%
have provided the right of notice the
 
04:14:41.550 --> 04:14:41.560 align:start position:0%
right of repeal the right of an
 
04:14:45.309 --> 04:14:45.319 align:start position:0%
impartial decision maker they are there
 
04:14:48.070 --> 04:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
now this bill is not
 
04:14:50.550 --> 04:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
necessary thank you for allowing me to
 
04:14:51.990 --> 04:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
vent my frustration thank you any
 
04:14:52.000 --> 04:14:53.269 align:start position:0%
vent my frustration thank you any
further

04:14:53.269 --> 04:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
further
 
04:14:55.790 --> 04:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
discussion represent
 
04:14:58.630 --> 04:14:58.640 align:start position:0%
luno thank you very much Mr chair and
 
04:15:02.630 --> 04:15:02.640 align:start position:0%
and um and I I I agree with with
 
04:15:04.790 --> 04:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
everything representative Miler uh has
 
04:15:07.269 --> 04:15:07.279 align:start position:0%
said and I think during his um during
 
04:15:09.870 --> 04:15:09.880 align:start position:0%
questioning of the bills Prime sponsor
 
04:15:14.389 --> 04:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
um uh when it was uh when it was clearly
 
04:15:18.030 --> 04:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
uh uh came out that uh that no the prime
 
04:15:20.630 --> 04:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
sponsor was not aware of any uh any
 
04:15:23.830 --> 04:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
significant or or really any problems at
 
04:15:27.630 --> 04:15:27.640 align:start position:0%
all with respect to the um the um the
 
04:15:30.429 --> 04:15:30.439 align:start position:0%
due process uh proceedings in any of our
 
04:15:33.070 --> 04:15:33.080 align:start position:0%
community colleges or university um
 
04:15:37.590 --> 04:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
system colleges that um that
 
04:15:39.990 --> 04:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
you know that that really you know for
 
04:15:42.670 --> 04:15:42.680 align:start position:0%
for us to move forward with something
 
04:15:45.429 --> 04:15:45.439 align:start position:0%
like this something that's going to cost
 
04:15:48.030 --> 04:15:48.040 align:start position:0%
the university system millions of
 
04:15:49.950 --> 04:15:49.960 align:start position:0%
dollars per the fiscal
 
04:15:52.189 --> 04:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
note to
 
04:15:56.990 --> 04:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
address to have to redesign reopt rules
 
04:15:58.670 --> 04:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
going to the Board of Trustees to have
 
04:16:01.550 --> 04:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
those rules
 
04:16:05.030 --> 04:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
approved retooling the code of conduct
 
04:16:09.710 --> 04:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
for students for faculty for visitors on
 
04:16:13.269 --> 04:16:13.279 align:start position:0%
campus to relearn and retach all of
 
04:16:13.279 --> 04:16:14.309 align:start position:0%
campus to relearn and retach all of
these

04:16:14.309 --> 04:16:14.319 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:16:17.790 --> 04:16:17.800 align:start position:0%
rules and get the practices in place to
 
04:16:19.349 --> 04:16:19.359 align:start position:0%
employ these
 
04:16:22.670 --> 04:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
rules is not only a giant
 
04:16:27.550 --> 04:16:27.560 align:start position:0%
distraction for for two of the country's
 
04:16:29.229 --> 04:16:29.239 align:start position:0%
best and
 
04:16:29.239 --> 04:16:31.750 align:start position:0%
best and
finest

04:16:31.750 --> 04:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
finest
 
04:16:34.469 --> 04:16:34.479 align:start position:0%
public systems for community colleges
 
04:16:35.870 --> 04:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
and and and
 
04:16:38.670 --> 04:16:38.680 align:start position:0%
universities but it's a giant waste of
 
04:16:41.510 --> 04:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
time and it's a giant waste of money um
 
04:16:44.269 --> 04:16:44.279 align:start position:0%
we have students to educate we have that
 
04:16:48.510 --> 04:16:48.520 align:start position:0%
that that that come from all across the
 
04:16:49.870 --> 04:16:49.880 align:start position:0%
state and come from many other states
 
04:16:54.670 --> 04:16:54.680 align:start position:0%
and many other countries uh and to
 
04:16:57.510 --> 04:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
completely upend and flip
 
04:17:01.630 --> 04:17:01.640 align:start position:0%
over these processes that touch every
 
04:17:05.269 --> 04:17:05.279 align:start position:0%
aspect of the of our colleges and
 
04:17:08.830 --> 04:17:08.840 align:start position:0%
universities systems operations is just
 
04:17:12.550 --> 04:17:12.560 align:start position:0%
unbelievable we would have to feel that
 
04:17:14.870 --> 04:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
we would have to know that something's
 
04:17:18.070 --> 04:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
going wrong so I've been on The nhti
 
04:17:20.469 --> 04:17:20.479 align:start position:0%
Advisory board for the last 25 years I
 
04:17:22.630 --> 04:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
think I'm probably pretty close uh to
 
04:17:26.510 --> 04:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
that and and I've Jared it for the last
 
04:17:29.349 --> 04:17:29.359 align:start position:0%
four or five years and during that time
 
04:17:34.229 --> 04:17:34.239 align:start position:0%
I have never ever ever heard of a single
 
04:17:37.109 --> 04:17:37.119 align:start position:0%
situation at nhti at any of our
 
04:17:39.349 --> 04:17:39.359 align:start position:0%
community colleges and I'm also on a
 
04:17:44.149 --> 04:17:44.159 align:start position:0%
board at the uh at UNH um uh I've never
 
04:17:47.269 --> 04:17:47.279 align:start position:0%
ever heard of of of any sort of
 
04:17:49.790 --> 04:17:49.800 align:start position:0%
situation where um where students do
 
04:17:52.750 --> 04:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
process rights were violated and I'm not
 
04:17:56.229 --> 04:17:56.239 align:start position:0%
saying that they're that everything at
 
04:17:58.630 --> 04:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
at um at our colleges every infraction
 
04:18:01.309 --> 04:18:01.319 align:start position:0%
is minor they're not they're not um
 
04:18:03.990 --> 04:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner you know said that
 
04:18:05.469 --> 04:18:05.479 align:start position:0%
that they're not we've seen some
 
04:18:08.149 --> 04:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
infractions that not only resulted in
 
04:18:11.630 --> 04:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
sexual assault but also murder of of um
 
04:18:14.469 --> 04:18:14.479 align:start position:0%
of an individual and and yes that
 
04:18:16.269 --> 04:18:16.279 align:start position:0%
involved criminal proceedings involved
 
04:18:18.870 --> 04:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
disciplinary proceedings on campus and
 
04:18:22.030 --> 04:18:22.040 align:start position:0%
the university system got it right and
 
04:18:24.710 --> 04:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
to throw it all to tear it all up throw
 
04:18:28.269 --> 04:18:28.279 align:start position:0%
it all up in the air get rid of 50 years
 
04:18:30.630 --> 04:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
worth of incremental development and
 
04:18:33.070 --> 04:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
Improvement of of a system and say you
 
04:18:34.550 --> 04:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
know what we're going to we're going to
 
04:18:36.109 --> 04:18:36.119 align:start position:0%
we're going to tear it all up we're
 
04:18:37.750 --> 04:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
going to we're going to put something
 
04:18:39.149 --> 04:18:39.159 align:start position:0%
new in and maybe we're going to get
 
04:18:40.670 --> 04:18:40.680 align:start position:0%
right on it's going to cost millions and
 
04:18:43.469 --> 04:18:43.479 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars we better be really
 
04:18:45.830 --> 04:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
really sure that there's a problem in
 
04:18:48.990 --> 04:18:49.000 align:start position:0%
place but there's no problem in place no
 
04:18:51.109 --> 04:18:51.119 align:start position:0%
problem uh that that that we can see
 
04:18:53.990 --> 04:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
right now representative Myer talked
 
04:18:57.550 --> 04:18:57.560 align:start position:0%
about how how U just in the last year
 
04:19:01.750 --> 04:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
3,000 complaints um at uh uh at the
 
04:19:01.760 --> 04:19:02.950 align:start position:0%
3,000 complaints um at uh uh at the
University

04:19:02.950 --> 04:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
University
 
04:19:05.389 --> 04:19:05.399 align:start position:0%
system almost all of those complaints
 
04:19:07.189 --> 04:19:07.199 align:start position:0%
were resolved without a hearing 80
 
04:19:09.670 --> 04:19:09.680 align:start position:0%
resulted in hearings I'm I presume those
 
04:19:12.590 --> 04:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
were resolved satisfactory
 
04:19:16.060 --> 04:19:16.070 align:start position:0%
satisfactorily um as well but
 
04:19:16.070 --> 04:19:17.189 align:start position:0%
satisfactorily um as well but
[Music]

04:19:17.189 --> 04:19:17.199 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:19:21.750 --> 04:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
but what we've got in place right
 
04:19:24.269 --> 04:19:24.279 align:start position:0%
now is
 
04:19:26.429 --> 04:19:26.439 align:start position:0%
working and it's meeting the needs of
 
04:19:28.309 --> 04:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
our students meeting the needs of
 
04:19:30.510 --> 04:19:30.520 align:start position:0%
faculty and staff and meeting the needs
 
04:19:32.830 --> 04:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
of the families that that that are that
 
04:19:34.510 --> 04:19:34.520 align:start position:0%
are public colleges and universities
 
04:19:38.830 --> 04:19:38.840 align:start position:0%
serve so so to to tear tear it all up at
 
04:19:40.630 --> 04:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
a cost of millions of dollars when
 
04:19:43.630 --> 04:19:43.640 align:start position:0%
there's no reason to do so um based on
 
04:19:47.030 --> 04:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
something that that we have no idea what
 
04:19:50.030 --> 04:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
sort of disruption it's going to cause
 
04:19:52.870 --> 04:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
is is I I you know there are words to
 
04:19:54.910 --> 04:19:54.920 align:start position:0%
describe it not going to use those words
 
04:19:57.910 --> 04:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
here but but I would encourage everybody
 
04:20:00.790 --> 04:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
to to vote against the oop pass vote for
 
04:20:05.269 --> 04:20:05.279 align:start position:0%
an itl and if we cannot get um um uh do
 
04:20:07.630 --> 04:20:07.640 align:start position:0%
that at least put it off for an interim
 
04:20:09.670 --> 04:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
study so that we can try to get an idea
 
04:20:11.269 --> 04:20:11.279 align:start position:0%
as to what these problems are because so
 
04:20:13.070 --> 04:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
far everybody that's come before this
 
04:20:14.710 --> 04:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
committee with respect this has had
 
04:20:17.670 --> 04:20:17.680 align:start position:0%
nothing to say with uh with with about
 
04:20:19.630 --> 04:20:19.640 align:start position:0%
about current problems or any rationale
 
04:20:21.710 --> 04:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
for this thank you Mr chair you're
 
04:20:24.790 --> 04:20:24.800 align:start position:0%

04:20:29.910 --> 04:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you um uh I refer back to

former Chief Justice uh Lynn
 
04:20:40.070 --> 04:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
um in relation to uh tearing everything
 
04:20:42.990 --> 04:20:43.000 align:start position:0%
up and throwing it out um and that he
 
04:20:46.630 --> 04:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
pointed out on page two this is just the
 
04:20:50.710 --> 04:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
minimum process that uh would be put in
 
04:20:53.950 --> 04:20:53.960 align:start position:0%
place in order to protect um the rights
 
04:20:59.389 --> 04:20:59.399 align:start position:0%
of the accused but also uh of the um the
 
04:21:04.030 --> 04:21:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:06.950 --> 04:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
protections further discussion
 
04:21:09.830 --> 04:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
represent beler thank you Mr chair I
 
04:21:12.750 --> 04:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
would Echo uh representative cordell's
 
04:21:14.309 --> 04:21:14.319 align:start position:0%
comments that this is this is just a
 
04:21:16.790 --> 04:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
floor and if the college's own processes
 
04:21:18.149 --> 04:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
through collective bargaining or any
 
04:21:21.030 --> 04:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
other process are already at this level
 
04:21:23.670 --> 04:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
not a thing need
 
04:21:27.510 --> 04:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
change uh beyond that we've heard we've
 
04:21:29.189 --> 04:21:29.199 align:start position:0%
heard that there were no problems in New
 
04:21:31.309 --> 04:21:31.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but I don't I don't understand
 
04:21:33.630 --> 04:21:33.640 align:start position:0%
that because we actually heard testimony
 
04:21:37.630 --> 04:21:37.640 align:start position:0%
of problems in New Hampshire regarding a
 
04:21:41.670 --> 04:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
lack of due process uneven weights and
 
04:21:45.750 --> 04:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
measures being applied depending on the
 
04:21:47.830 --> 04:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
circumstances uh and lastly I would
 
04:21:50.710 --> 04:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
address the issue of scripture people
 
04:21:53.309 --> 04:21:53.319 align:start position:0%
can think it's fiction that's fine but
 
04:21:55.429 --> 04:21:55.439 align:start position:0%
it does establish that the precedent of
 
04:21:57.349 --> 04:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
cross-examination which was denied we
 
04:21:59.590 --> 04:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
heard in testimony in at least some
 
04:22:03.189 --> 04:22:03.199 align:start position:0%
cases is thousands of years old in
 
04:22:03.199 --> 04:22:04.790 align:start position:0%
cases is thousands of years old in
Western

04:22:04.790 --> 04:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
Western
 
04:22:07.070 --> 04:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
culture thousands of years old that
 
04:22:09.469 --> 04:22:09.479 align:start position:0%
we've been doing this for that long it's
 
04:22:11.910 --> 04:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
such a core part of our Justice our
 
04:22:13.750 --> 04:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
concept of due process that we would
 
04:22:17.830 --> 04:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
allow for that to happen um and as to
 
04:22:20.269 --> 04:22:20.279 align:start position:0%
the request that I uh no longer ever
 
04:22:22.030 --> 04:22:22.040 align:start position:0%
cite scripture I would kindly decline
 
04:22:23.469 --> 04:22:23.479 align:start position:0%
that request thank
 
04:22:31.030 --> 04:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:34.710 --> 04:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
Damon I will be voting against this
 
04:22:38.910 --> 04:22:38.920 align:start position:0%
bill as one of those survivors of
 
04:22:41.830 --> 04:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
assault I would not have
 
04:22:45.670 --> 04:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to follow up what happened to me
 
04:22:50.750 --> 04:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:55.990 --> 04:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
sort the way that things are handled as
 
04:22:56.000 --> 04:22:57.710 align:start position:0%
sort the way that things are handled as
described

04:22:57.710 --> 04:22:57.720 align:start position:0%
described
 
04:23:01.469 --> 04:23:01.479 align:start position:0%
by the UNH and Community College people

presently their
 
04:23:06.990 --> 04:23:07.000 align:start position:0%
process is what I experienced
 
04:23:10.389 --> 04:23:10.399 align:start position:0%
and I think it is far more respectful of
 
04:23:13.710 --> 04:23:13.720 align:start position:0%
both the As salent and the victim than
 
04:23:17.870 --> 04:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
