00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
speak
 
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
for longer than that but i think what
 
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
we'll do is try to hold everybody to
 
00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.309 align:start position:0%
we'll do is try to hold everybody to
speak

00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
speak
 
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
for no longer than
 
00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
five minutes at the most and uh will
 
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
time people to make sure that they can
 
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:17.360 align:start position:0%
stay within that time frame
 
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
we will
 
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
i think as we did with our
 
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
omnibus bill last week is
 
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
we're not going to go
 
00:07:28.629 --> 00:07:28.639 align:start position:0%
section by section i'm not sure that
 
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
that's the most fair way to do it
 
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
otherwise you have people in the last
 
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
section waiting two or three hours to
 
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.350 align:start position:0%
section waiting two or three hours to
testify

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
testify
 
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do is we're going to
 
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
go through and we'll call upon those
 
00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
people who have pre-registered to speak
 
00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:45.759 align:start position:0%
and just ask them to identify what
 
00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
portion or portions of the bill that
 
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
they want to speak to
 
00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
before they give their testimony
 
00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
and with that we will begin this morning
 
00:07:58.629 --> 00:07:58.639 align:start position:0%
by calling upon the prime sponsor of the
 
00:08:01.909 --> 00:08:01.919 align:start position:0%
bill and that is senator sharon carson
 
00:08:01.919 --> 00:08:03.830 align:start position:0%
bill and that is senator sharon carson
uh

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:08:06.309 --> 00:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
could i ask a question yes
 
00:08:08.469 --> 00:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
uh i just wanted to alert you and i
 
00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
think you already know
 
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
that uh there's an amendment that i have
 
00:08:15.589 --> 00:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
that i would at the appropriate time
 
00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
like the opportunity simply to introduce
 
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:20.240 align:start position:0%
to the committee and and and have it as
 
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
part of the uh
 
00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.150 align:start position:0%
part of the uh
proceeding

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:24.160 align:start position:0%
proceeding
 
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh if i can ask our is it your intention
 
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
to add that to uh one section of the
 
00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.189 align:start position:0%
to add that to uh one section of the
bill

00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh yes you would go on to part five of
 
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
and i i mentioned it because i think
 
00:08:39.829 --> 00:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
some of the people attending may want to
 
00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
speak to that amendment
 
00:08:42.719 --> 00:08:43.509 align:start position:0%
speak to that amendment
uh

00:08:43.509 --> 00:08:43.519 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:08:43.519 --> 00:08:44.550 align:start position:0%
uh
my

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh okay
 
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
and i i think the same thing as i just
 
00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
got from uh from ols an amendment which
 
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
i think i might add to part seven of the
 
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
bill so i probably will address it when
 
00:08:59.750 --> 00:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
we get to part sub
 
00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
and if you wanted to address it when we
 
00:09:01.279 --> 00:09:01.990 align:start position:0%
and if you wanted to address it when we
get

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
uh it when somebody testify when we
 
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
when somebody testifies to part seven i
 
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
will also address that if somebody
 
00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
speaks to part five if you would address
 
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
it at the time i think that's probably a
 
00:09:15.269 --> 00:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
good idea
 
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
okay and again i'll call upon senator
 
00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.509 align:start position:0%
okay and again i'll call upon senator
carson

00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:21.519 align:start position:0%

hudson and auburn and i have this
 
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
morning for your consideration an
 
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
omnibus bill
 
00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
which seeks to
 
00:09:43.269 --> 00:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
which is really relative to civil
 
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
actions and criminal liability um the uh
 
00:09:49.509 --> 00:09:49.519 align:start position:0%
the chair is correct there are
 
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
11 different parts to this bill these
 
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
again were all separate bills that were
 
00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:55.750 align:start position:0%
again were all separate bills that were
filed

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
filed
 
00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
but we combined them just because of
 
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
time constraints
 
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
um so mr chairman um would you like to
 
00:10:04.949 --> 00:10:04.959 align:start position:0%
me to go through
 
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
the uh parts of the bill that i um have
 
00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.990 align:start position:0%
the uh parts of the bill that i um have
filed

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
well uh
 
00:10:16.389 --> 00:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
to to the to the extent that you're the
 
00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
primary sponsor and uh
 
00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
yeah i think
 
00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.910 align:start position:0%
yeah i think
uh

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:23.519 align:start position:0%
at least with regard to the bill we
 
00:10:25.269 --> 00:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
heard last week
 
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
there was at least one portion of the
 
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:28.720 align:start position:0%
bill that nobody spoke to
 
00:10:30.069 --> 00:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
after you spoke
 
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
so you might want to at least
 
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
mention each part as you go through to
 
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
introduce the bill
 
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
okay that's fine mr chairman um i do
 
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.240 align:start position:0%

00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:44.399 align:start position:0%

i'm looking for all my testimony here
 
00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
um this bill was is really in response
 
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
to a bill that was uh
 
00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
that was signed into law in 2016
 
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
which prohibited the shining of laser
 
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
pointers at airplanes law enforcement
 
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
officers law enforcement vehicles
 
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.190 align:start position:0%
officers law enforcement vehicles
persons

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
persons
 
00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
occupied vehicles and other structures
 
00:12:00.069 --> 00:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
but it also included some limited
 
00:12:02.629 --> 00:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
exceptions which had the unintentional
 
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
effect of making even some everyday uses
 
00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
of lasers illegal such as vehicle
 
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
sensors golf range finders hunting range
 
00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
finders and things of that nature
 
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
it also prohibited some research
 
00:12:17.829 --> 00:12:17.839 align:start position:0%
activities that aerospace and defense
 
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
technology companies conduct with lasers
 
00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.190 align:start position:0%
technology companies conduct with lasers
and

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:21.200 align:start position:0%

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
laser systems
 
00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
and so really
 
00:12:27.269 --> 00:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
the this particular part of the bill is
 
00:12:30.389 --> 00:12:30.399 align:start position:0%
an attempt to clarify those lawful uses
 
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:32.720 align:start position:0%
of lasers while ensuring malicious
 
00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
malicious use of lasers repeat retain
 
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.110 align:start position:0%
malicious use of lasers repeat retain
remain

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
remain
 
00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.710 align:start position:0%
remain
prohibited

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
prohibited
 
00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:39.910 align:start position:0%
prohibited
um

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
the second part of the bill
 
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
um is the result a revised uniform law
 
00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
on ontario acts and the uniform real
 
00:12:52.069 --> 00:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
property electronic recording acts
 
00:12:52.079 --> 00:12:53.190 align:start position:0%
property electronic recording acts
this

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:53.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
was a bill that came through last year
 
00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:56.629 align:start position:0%
was a bill that came through last year
but

00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
uh was i believe part of an omnibus bill
 
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
that died
 
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
and 28 states have notified their notary
 
00:13:07.509 --> 00:13:07.519 align:start position:0%
laws to allow for this practice
 
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
and since we've been under the covid19
 
00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
pandemic restraints
 
00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:14.639 align:start position:0%

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
the executive orders should be reviewed
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
regarding putting them into statute
 
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
and a group of stakeholders worked over
 
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
the summer on this language including
 
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:29.600 align:start position:0%

second under a suspended sentence
 
00:13:53.189 --> 00:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
this will allow people to apply for a
 
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
suspended sentence earlier
 
00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
and uh the committee did have an
 
00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.470 align:start position:0%
and uh the committee did have an
amendment

00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:14:00.069 --> 00:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
um part four is relative to
 
00:14:06.629 --> 00:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
civil liability for damages to highways
 
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
mr chairman there is going to be an
 
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
amendment coming forward it's being
 
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
prepared uh today it should have been
 
00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:14.720 align:start position:0%
here but unfortunately we did not
 
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
receive it enough time
 
00:14:19.269 --> 00:14:19.279 align:start position:0%
um the department of
 
00:14:23.189 --> 00:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
uh the department of transportation has
 
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
asked for this um
 
00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:28.720 align:start position:0%
for this excuse me i'm on the wrong one
 
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
no no i'm right okay um
 
00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
they've asked for this amendment for
 
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
additional clarifications
 
00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:35.829 align:start position:0%
additional clarifications
um

00:14:35.829 --> 00:14:35.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
section uh this really was this part of
 
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
the bill section four
 
00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
was filed uh at the request of the dark
 
00:14:45.189 --> 00:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
department to assist them in collecting
 
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
monies owed to the state when people
 
00:14:51.269 --> 00:14:51.279 align:start position:0%
have caused damage to the highways
 
00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh part five concerns uh
 
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
is uh procedures for structured
 
00:14:59.269 --> 00:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
settlements we were asked to file this
 
00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
because new hampshire is the only state
 
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
that has not updated their structured
 
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
settlement laws
 
00:15:07.269 --> 00:15:07.279 align:start position:0%
this legislation will bring new
 
00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:10.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire into line with other states
 
00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
there were a number of stakeholders that
 
00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
have been working on this language um
 
00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:16.720 align:start position:0%
and at the time of our public hearing
 
00:15:18.949 --> 00:15:18.959 align:start position:0%
they did have an amendment which we did
 
00:15:18.959 --> 00:15:20.150 align:start position:0%
they did have an amendment which we did
adopt

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
adopt
 
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh that is my testimony on that
 
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
particular uh part of the bill
 
00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
part six is establishing the new
 
00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire collaborative law act
 
00:15:36.069 --> 00:15:36.079 align:start position:0%
um this bill was part of an omnibus bill
 
00:15:38.389 --> 00:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
that was vetoed last year
 
00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
and i'm looking to see where the
 
00:15:42.389 --> 00:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
testimony was on that so i can give you
 
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
a little bit
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
more information
 
00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
um i just have so many different pieces
 
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
of paper here
 
00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
um let's see
 
00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.350 align:start position:0%
um let's see
um

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:56.240 align:start position:0%
okay that's structured settlements
 
00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.829 align:start position:0%
okay that's structured settlements
okay

00:15:57.829 --> 00:15:57.839 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
this um
 
00:16:01.509 --> 00:16:01.519 align:start position:0%
really collaborative practice is a
 
00:16:03.749 --> 00:16:03.759 align:start position:0%
privately contracted based business a
 
00:16:05.749 --> 00:16:05.759 align:start position:0%
process of alternative dispute
 
00:16:05.759 --> 00:16:07.189 align:start position:0%
process of alternative dispute
resolution

00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:08.959 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire collaborative law
 
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
practices uses a team approach with two
 
00:16:13.749 --> 00:16:13.759 align:start position:0%
attorneys to represent the parties
 
00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
a neutral facility coach facilitator and
 
00:16:17.829 --> 00:16:17.839 align:start position:0%
a financial professional
 
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:20.240 align:start position:0%
this practice is primarily used in the
 
00:16:22.629 --> 00:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
area of family law
 
00:16:24.949 --> 00:16:24.959 align:start position:0%
currently prior to entering into the
 
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
process parties and professionals sign a
 
00:16:29.829 --> 00:16:29.839 align:start position:0%
participation agreement that sets forth
 
00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
the expectations and the parameters of
 
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
the process
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
the passage of this legislation will
 
00:16:37.829 --> 00:16:37.839 align:start position:0%
standardize the contents of the
 
00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
participation agreement and process
 
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
there are occasions where the
 
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
collaborative process is not successful
 
00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
and in those instances the parties will
 
00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
resort to litigation this act will
 
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
ensure the confidentiality of the
 
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
process by limiting the ability to enter
 
00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
into evidence information that was
 
00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
gleaned during the process
 
00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
much like the mediation process ensuring
 
00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:06.959 align:start position:0%
the confidentiality allows individuals
 
00:17:09.429 --> 00:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
to look at options without being afraid
 
00:17:11.189 --> 00:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
that they might come back to bite them
 
00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
in the litigation process
 
00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
this is based on a uniform collaboration
 
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
law act that is suited to new hampshire
 
00:17:23.029 --> 00:17:23.039 align:start position:0%
and again there are 19 states that have
 
00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:26.079 align:start position:0%
passed similar legislation and five
 
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
the next section is uh concerns program
 
00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:34.150 align:start position:0%

act
 
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
section the next section which i believe
 
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
is section eight
 
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.080 align:start position:0%

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
section 9 is making an appropriation
 
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:10.240 align:start position:0%

here today
 
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
this section of the bill was filed at
 
00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
the request of the department of
 
00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:38.230 align:start position:0%

and they've seen a significant rise in
 
00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:42.799 align:start position:0%
the number of delivery drivers on our
 
00:18:42.799 --> 00:18:44.230 align:start position:0%

neighborhood
and

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
this is even more as a result of the
 
00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
covet 19 pandemic with more goods and
 
00:18:59.190 --> 00:18:59.200 align:start position:0%

this section would streamline the
 
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
process for employers to obtain motor
 
00:19:06.789 --> 00:19:06.799 align:start position:0%
vehicle and license records from the
 
00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:08.720 align:start position:0%
department of motor vehicles to allow

the release of electronic records which
 
00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
will ultimately help protect public
 
00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:14.789 align:start position:0%
will ultimately help protect public
safety

00:19:14.789 --> 00:19:14.799 align:start position:0%
safety
 
00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
virtually all other states allow
 
00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
electronic employer driving record and
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
license status checks
 
00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:22.799 align:start position:0%
this bill would put new hampshire in
 
00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:24.799 align:start position:0%
line with what is currently practiced
 
00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
across the country
 
00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
importantly these bills are already
 
00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
disclosed to employers these records
 
00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
excuse me are already disclosed to
 
00:19:36.789 --> 00:19:36.799 align:start position:0%
employers on an individual basis under
 
00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire law
 
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
this bill would merely change the manner
 
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
in which the records can be released to
 
00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
allow them into electronic
 
00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:47.590 align:start position:0%
allow them into electronic
form

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
form
 
00:19:50.549 --> 00:19:50.559 align:start position:0%
it will help facilitate employers
 
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
and the dmv to conduct motor vehicle
 
00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
record checks more efficiently
 
00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
when data on driving driver records and
 
00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:00.559 align:start position:0%
license status is made available it
 
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
allows employers to identify high-risk
 
00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.390 align:start position:0%
allows employers to identify high-risk
drivers

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
drivers
 
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
enforce company policies and make
 
00:20:09.669 --> 00:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
well-educated driving decisions
 
00:20:12.149 --> 00:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
consumer privacy protections currently
 
00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
exist under federal law
 
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
and state law and will not be impacted
 
00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
by this bill
 
00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
for example the employee must consent
 
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
before the records are released
 
00:20:25.029 --> 00:20:25.039 align:start position:0%
seven part seven
 
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
section seven there are others here to
 
00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
testify that can answer the questions
 
00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.470 align:start position:0%
testify that can answer the questions
um

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:32.549 --> 00:20:32.559 align:start position:0%
and in the end this will streamline
 
00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
current practice and help prevent unsafe
 
00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
drivers from jeopardizing the safety of
 
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
our public roads roadways
 
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i'd like to offer a
 
00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
correction this bill was not filed at
 
00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
the at the request of the department of
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
transportation um i thought it was but
 
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
and finally uh section 12 which is the
 
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
authorization to grow industrial hemp
 
00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
this was a bill that passed senate last
 
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
year was in an omnibus bill
 
00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
and that omnibus bill was vetoed and it
 
00:21:06.789 --> 00:21:06.799 align:start position:0%
simply will allow um
 
00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
the growth people to grow
 
00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
um industrial hemp but under certain
 
00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.430 align:start position:0%
um industrial hemp but under certain
circumstances

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
00:21:16.789 --> 00:21:16.799 align:start position:0%
this legislation came about because
 
00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
there were companies that were looking
 
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
to relocate to new hampshire
 
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
and wanted to do
 
00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
some business concerning industrial hemp
 
00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
and because of our current laws they
 
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
were not allowed to do so
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
so i will at this point conclude my
 
00:21:36.149 --> 00:21:36.159 align:start position:0%

morning members of the committee for the
 
00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
record my name is becky whitley and i'm
 
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
honored to serve new hampshire senate
 
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
district 15 which includes the wonderful
 
00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:31.919 align:start position:0%
communities of concord penacook henniker
 
00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
hopkinton and warner so if i may i'd
 
00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
like to speak to sections three
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
and seven
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
so speaking first to part three this is
 
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
relative to incarceration under
 
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
suspended sentence this is a bill that
 
00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
actually passed the house last year in
 
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
the senate judiciary committee uh as
 
00:22:55.029 --> 00:22:55.039 align:start position:0%
senator carson
 
00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
indicated we did work with the
 
00:22:59.750 --> 00:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
department of corrections and
 
00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
other stakeholders to come up with a
 
00:23:03.029 --> 00:23:03.039 align:start position:0%
compromise position
 
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
so the language that you see
 
00:23:07.669 --> 00:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
in this version of the bill
 
00:23:10.149 --> 00:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
that would simply allow folks to apply
 
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
for a suspended sentence within 12
 
00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
months of serving two-thirds of the
 
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
minimum sentence that is the compromised
 
00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
language the the previous
 
00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:19.830 align:start position:0%
language the the previous
uh

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
policy that had passed the house was 18
 
00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
months so i just wanted to point that
 
00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
out and i'm very grateful to the
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
stakeholders that worked on that
 
00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
compromise and brought it to the senate
 
00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
judiciary committee
 
00:23:32.549 --> 00:23:32.559 align:start position:0%
so the other uh part i would like to
 
00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
speak to is part seven this is relative
 
00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
to probate administration um and so
 
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
forth it has a lot in there i will say
 
00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
this part of the bill actually combines
 
00:23:46.789 --> 00:23:46.799 align:start position:0%
two bills from last session that also
 
00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
had a cove of death like so many uh
 
00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
bills did but just generally part seven
 
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
of this bill expands the waiver of
 
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
administration process and probate
 
00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:56.630 align:start position:0%
administration process and probate
proceedings

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
proceedings
 
00:23:59.750 --> 00:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
makes a non-substantive clarification to
 
00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
the intestines statute
 
00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:03.919 align:start position:0%
and make some clarifying changes to the
 
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
new hampshire uniform power of attorney
 
00:24:09.269 --> 00:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
act and it also adopts the uniform
 
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
disclaimer property interest act with
 
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
the addition of some language requested
 
00:24:14.549 --> 00:24:14.559 align:start position:0%
by the department of health and human
 
00:24:14.559 --> 00:24:15.669 align:start position:0%
by the department of health and human
services

00:24:15.669 --> 00:24:15.679 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:24:17.669 --> 00:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
so i will say the creation of this bill
 
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
was done in collaboration with a group
 
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
of trust and estates attorneys they have
 
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
a legislative working group of about 45
 
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
trusted estates lawyers
 
00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:32.320 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire so i will defer um this
 
00:24:33.909 --> 00:24:33.919 align:start position:0%
is not my area of
 
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
expertise so i will defer all technical
 
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
questions on this portion to attorney
 
00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
ben hillman from shaheen and gordon who
 
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.080 align:start position:0%

00:24:46.149 --> 00:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
developing this bill and answer some
 
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
technical questions on the policy
 
00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
decisions made so i appreciate your time

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
environmental agriculture committee
 
00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
and i'm just speaking to section 11 of
 
00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:19.510 align:start position:0%
this bill
and

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:20.230 align:start position:0%
and
the

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
which is the section dealing with
 
00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:25.039 align:start position:0%
industrial hemp and the initial
 
00:26:27.269 --> 00:26:27.279 align:start position:0%
legislation that um
 
00:26:29.669 --> 00:26:29.679 align:start position:0%
that is making it an amendment to
 
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
it uh came through our committee in 2015
 
00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
i believe that uh representative simpson
 
00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
might remember that uh the um
 
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
at that point it uh
 
00:26:46.149 --> 00:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
uh the bill the 2015 bill gave uh
 
00:26:47.669 --> 00:26:47.679 align:start position:0%
universities and the research
 
00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
universities in the state the ability to
 
00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
do research on hemp at that point uh
 
00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
hemp was not otherwise legal in
 
00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:56.549 align:start position:0%
hemp was not otherwise legal in
uh

00:26:56.549 --> 00:26:56.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
the um in the united based on u.s law
 
00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
except as part of a
 
00:27:03.269 --> 00:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
pilot program
 
00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
00:27:07.269 --> 00:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
um that was creating a possibility for
 
00:27:07.279 --> 00:27:08.310 align:start position:0%
um that was creating a possibility for
research

00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
research
 
00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh there was hesitancy at um
 
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
still at the university to do any
 
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
research on it because of
 
00:27:17.029 --> 00:27:17.039 align:start position:0%
its ambiguous
 
00:27:17.039 --> 00:27:19.269 align:start position:0%
its ambiguous
status

00:27:19.269 --> 00:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
status
 
00:27:22.389 --> 00:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
and also because uh just in terms of
 
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
sorting out priorities i believe that
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
there is
 
00:27:27.269 --> 00:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
there was some interest in being able to
 
00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
contract out some of that uh research
 
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
growing uh which it brought about the
 
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh a bill last term uh that senator
 
00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:38.720 align:start position:0%
senator carson put forward to
 
00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:41.269 align:start position:0%
senator carson put forward to
um

00:27:41.269 --> 00:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
to amend it and allow contracts growing
 
00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039 align:start position:0%
the universities to do contract growing
 
00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh so that they wouldn't necessarily be
 
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
doing it on university land
 
00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:52.710 align:start position:0%
doing it on university land
uh

00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:53.590 align:start position:0%
uh
the

00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
and i am entirely in support of that i'm
 
00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
not quite sure how that's that interacts
 
00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:01.269 align:start position:0%
not quite sure how that's that interacts
with

00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
the new laws at this at the federal
 
00:28:06.789 --> 00:28:06.799 align:start position:0%
level which allow anybody to grow hemp
 
00:28:10.549 --> 00:28:10.559 align:start position:0%
as long as they are licensed by the usda
 
00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
or by their state if their state has an
 
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
inspection program new hampshire does
 
00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
not have a state inspection program so
 
00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
they would have to be licensed by the
 
00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:19.909 align:start position:0%
they would have to be licensed by the
usda

00:28:19.909 --> 00:28:19.919 align:start position:0%
usda
 
00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
um my concern is that i had mentioned to
 
00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
senator carson at some point
 
00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.070 align:start position:0%
senator carson at some point
near

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
near
 
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
before the filing period last term
 
00:28:32.389 --> 00:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
last fall
 
00:28:32.399 --> 00:28:33.990 align:start position:0%
last fall
that

00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
there needed to be a minor correction in
 
00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:36.870 align:start position:0%
there needed to be a minor correction in
the

00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire statute that allows
 
00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
uh growing hemp under federal federal
 
00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.669 align:start position:0%
uh growing hemp under federal federal
guidelines

00:28:43.669 --> 00:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
that uh passed in uh hb 459 last um
 
00:28:51.029 --> 00:28:51.039 align:start position:0%
last term and
 
00:28:51.039 --> 00:28:51.830 align:start position:0%
last term and
uh

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
there was a drafty there was a error
 
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
there when i was writing that i didn't
 
00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
realize that the federal governor
 
00:29:00.389 --> 00:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
government does not have any licensing
 
00:29:02.789 --> 00:29:02.799 align:start position:0%
for people who process or
 
00:29:05.029 --> 00:29:05.039 align:start position:0%
uh or
 
00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
or sell hemp they just have licensing
 
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
for growing and i had put in a
 
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
requirement that uh people be federally
 
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
licensed to grow
 
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
to grow and process and uh and sell
 
00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
and uh what this i
 
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
sent a letter to the committee by email
 
00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
recommending a an amendment that would
 
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
cover that part of the law that would
 
00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
just remove the uh three or four words
 
00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
that require
 
00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
the federal license that doesn't exist
 
00:29:37.679 --> 00:29:38.389 align:start position:0%
the federal license that doesn't exist
for

00:29:38.389 --> 00:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
grow for processing and selling
 
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:43.510 align:start position:0%
uh so
um

00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:46.559 align:start position:0%
that is if you could you know
 
00:29:47.669 --> 00:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
i assume there's going to be some
 
00:29:49.269 --> 00:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
amendment on this bill so if you could
 
00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
include that language in
 
00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
your amendment that would be
 
00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
very useful and it would just correct a
 
00:29:58.389 --> 00:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
minor error that currently exists in
 
00:29:59.830 --> 00:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
our statutes
 
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
and i'd be happy to take any questions
 
00:30:03.909 --> 00:30:03.919 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for
 
00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
00:30:20.549 --> 00:30:20.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:21.970 align:start position:0%
representative joe shapiro
 
00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:39.590 align:start position:0%
representative joe shapiro
[Music]

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro hello can you
 
00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
hear me we can
 
00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
yes i would like to just speak to
 
00:30:52.389 --> 00:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
as the
 
00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
as the sponsor of the house bill
 
00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
205 which is identical to section 3
 
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
regarding suspended sentences i just
 
00:31:07.509 --> 00:31:07.519 align:start position:0%
want to make a few points
 
00:31:09.669 --> 00:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
number one that this
 
00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
bill does not change
 
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
the statute that's already in place
 
00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:15.990 align:start position:0%
the statute that's already in place
um

00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:18.149 --> 00:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
which allows people to petition to the
 
00:31:21.029 --> 00:31:21.039 align:start position:0%
courts to have their
 
00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
sentence suspended after serving
 
00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of that sentence
 
00:31:28.149 --> 00:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
it merely moves the time when people can
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
make that petition
 
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.110 align:start position:0%
make that petition
um

00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
to 12 months prior
 
00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that why this is so
 
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.350 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that why this is so
important

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:31:39.909 --> 00:31:39.919 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
by the time people requested
 
00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
a hearing with the court by the time
 
00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
people got that hearing with the court
 
00:31:51.669 --> 00:31:51.679 align:start position:0%
many months would pass
 
00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
and often
 
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
people who were petitioning the court
 
00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
for suspended sentence would also have
 
00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:59.430 align:start position:0%
for suspended sentence would also have
to

00:31:59.430 --> 00:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
complete programming rehabilitative
 
00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
programming such as
 
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
substance abuse treatment programming in
 
00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
the prison and they wouldn't be able to
 
00:32:10.789 --> 00:32:10.799 align:start position:0%
get access to those
 
00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
programs until they made the petition
 
00:32:15.509 --> 00:32:15.519 align:start position:0%
and sometimes it would take up to a year
 
00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
to complete those programs
 
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
so this um bill just allows people to
 
00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:21.990 align:start position:0%
so this um bill just allows people to
petition

00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
petition
 
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.029 align:start position:0%
petition
earlier

00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
so that they will actually be eligible
 
00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
if the court
 
00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
deems it so
 
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
to have their
 
00:32:32.549 --> 00:32:32.559 align:start position:0%
sentence suspended after two-thirds of
 
00:32:34.389 --> 00:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
their sentence
 
00:32:35.669 --> 00:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
i would also like to say that the
 
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
original bill both in the senate and in
 
00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
the house
 
00:32:41.509 --> 00:32:41.519 align:start position:0%
called for 18 months prior
 
00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
and that was objected to by
 
00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
corrections department
 
00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
and that was negotiated down to 12
 
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
months which was agreeable to the
 
00:32:57.029 --> 00:32:57.039 align:start position:0%
corrections department i would also like
 
00:32:59.590 --> 00:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
to say that this the
 
00:33:01.509 --> 00:33:01.519 align:start position:0%
this bill was initially
 
00:33:03.909 --> 00:33:03.919 align:start position:0%
initiated by
 
00:33:06.549 --> 00:33:06.559 align:start position:0%
men in the concord state prisons who
 
00:33:08.149 --> 00:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
serve on the
 
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
rcc which is the um
 
00:33:15.029 --> 00:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
resident communication committee
 
00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
and these are men who've devoted their
 
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
time in prison to making the most of
 
00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:20.640 align:start position:0%
their situation
 
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
who um
 
00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
meet regularly and work on
 
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:33.509 --> 00:33:33.519 align:start position:0%
people's sentences um useful to them as
 
00:33:36.149 --> 00:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
opposed to just serving time and this is
 
00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
a group of people who are really quite
 
00:33:41.669 --> 00:33:41.679 align:start position:0%
impressive and are working hard and this
 
00:33:44.149 --> 00:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
means a great deal to them so i hope you
 
00:33:46.549 --> 00:33:46.559 align:start position:0%
will take that into account um in
 
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
regards to section three
 
00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
thank you and i'm willing to take any
 
00:33:54.149 --> 00:33:54.159 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative chase
 
00:33:56.549 --> 00:33:56.559 align:start position:0%
yes thank you so much mr chair and thank
 
00:33:58.470 --> 00:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
you representative shapiro for taking my
 
00:33:58.480 --> 00:33:59.430 align:start position:0%
you representative shapiro for taking my
question

00:33:59.430 --> 00:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:00.310 align:start position:0%
question
um

00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:03.269 --> 00:34:03.279 align:start position:0%
i personally have a situation where
 
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
someone is
 
00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:06.070 align:start position:0%
someone is
incarcerated

00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
incarcerated
 
00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
because of defense on myself and um
 
00:34:11.829 --> 00:34:11.839 align:start position:0%
they have to complete a program before
 
00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
they're able to
 
00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:16.069 align:start position:0%
they're able to
pretend

00:34:16.069 --> 00:34:16.079 align:start position:0%
pretend
 
00:34:18.069 --> 00:34:18.079 align:start position:0%
before they're able to
 
00:34:19.349 --> 00:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
do what you're talking about the
 
00:34:22.149 --> 00:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
petition uh what i want to know is this
 
00:34:24.149 --> 00:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
does not mean that they don't finish
 
00:34:25.829 --> 00:34:25.839 align:start position:0%
their programs that they're supposed to
 
00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:27.599 align:start position:0%
do correct it just means that they're
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
able to put their time in because i do
 
00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
understand there is a backlog
 
00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:34.720 align:start position:0%
of trying to get into programs
 
00:34:36.069 --> 00:34:36.079 align:start position:0%
does that make sense
 
00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
yes well my understanding is that um
 
00:34:42.149 --> 00:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
you know this just gives people the
 
00:34:44.069 --> 00:34:44.079 align:start position:0%
right to petition at a certain time
 
00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
inmates the right to petition at a
 
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
certain time ultimately it's the court
 
00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
that makes a decision about whether to
 
00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
suspend their sentence okay and that
 
00:34:53.349 --> 00:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
that generally involves
 
00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
um people
 
00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
having to complete certain programming
 
00:34:58.400 --> 00:34:59.750 align:start position:0%
having to complete certain programming
um

00:34:59.750 --> 00:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
related to their particular issues
 
00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
in order to have the court do that so it
 
00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:06.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't change
 
00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
what it would take to be eligible it
 
00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:10.720 align:start position:0%
just changes the time when they can
 
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
petition it's really a very
 
00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:14.870 align:start position:0%
petition it's really a very
simple

00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
simple
 
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
fix to a glitch in the system um
 
00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
the statute to suspend people's
 
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
sentences after two-thirds is already
 
00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:25.190 align:start position:0%
sentences after two-thirds is already
there

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
representative mclean
 
00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
uh yeah uh thank you mr chairman thank
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question just so just
 
00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
to clarify aside from uh the time period
 
00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
which you negotiated the department of
 
00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
corrections is fully on board with this
 
00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:45.349 align:start position:0%
corrections is fully on board with this
legislation

00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
yes they are and when um house bill 205
 
00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
the identical bill was heard um
 
00:35:53.589 --> 00:35:53.599 align:start position:0%
in criminal justice
 
00:35:53.599 --> 00:35:54.790 align:start position:0%
in criminal justice
um

00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
where although i didn't think it was
 
00:35:57.910 --> 00:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
going to be controversial at all for
 
00:36:00.069 --> 00:36:00.079 align:start position:0%
some reason it was retained
 
00:36:01.829 --> 00:36:01.839 align:start position:0%
someone did come from the department of
 
00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:04.720 align:start position:0%
corrections to say that 12 months
 
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
was something that they supported and i
 
00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
think i probably have an email from
 
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner hanks
 
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
saying that as well which i could send
 
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
to your committee
 
00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:36:18.069 --> 00:36:18.079 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:23.589 --> 00:36:23.599 align:start position:0%

and

00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
i guess i'll just try again to see if
 
00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:43.349 --> 00:36:43.359 align:start position:0%

134
 
00:36:59.270 --> 00:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
this is a relatively simple bill
 
00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
or simple part of the bill with an
 
00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
extremely important component to it what
 
00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
we do here is we're making an
 
00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:05.910 align:start position:0%
we do here is we're making an
appropriation

00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
to fund mental health intervention
 
00:37:09.589 --> 00:37:09.599 align:start position:0%
training for our law enforcement
 
00:37:09.599 --> 00:37:10.950 align:start position:0%
training for our law enforcement
officers

00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
officers
 
00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.630 align:start position:0%
officers
uh

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:12.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
as you may well know and i'm sure that
 
00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
you do especially mr chairman um
 
00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
in bath just a few years ago a young man
 
00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
that was known to be suffering from some
 
00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:24.640 align:start position:0%
mental problems
 
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
ultimately was shot and killed by police
 
00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:29.270 align:start position:0%
ultimately was shot and killed by police
the

00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
shooting was ruled justified
 
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
but it was totally unnecessary there are
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
any number of points during that in
 
00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
during that um a situation at which the
 
00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
police officers with proper training
 
00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
okay could have stopped the individual
 
00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
and could have not had to use lethal
 
00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:47.750 align:start position:0%
and could have not had to use lethal
force

00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
force
 
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you're familiar with the
 
00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
incident that happened over in claremont
 
00:37:53.109 --> 00:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
just less than a month ago
 
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh in which the young man was shot again
 
00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
known to have mental problems and
 
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
ultimately the use of lethal force was
 
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
used when it was not necessary
 
00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:05.030 align:start position:0%
used when it was not necessary
justified

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
justified
 
00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
probably necessary not
 
00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
and so what this bill will do is to
 
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
provide two hundred and ten thousand
 
00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
dollars for the biennium
 
00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh that ends june 30th of 23
 
00:38:19.109 --> 00:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
uh for police officer training um by
 
00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
police standards and training uh
 
00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
overseen by them but provided by uh
 
00:38:25.589 --> 00:38:25.599 align:start position:0%
nanny uh ken norton over at nami who i'm
 
00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
pretty certain will testify as well in
 
00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
favor of this the 210 000 figure
 
00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh is arrived at because the current
 
00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
funding for this program which is
 
00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
excellent as we speak
 
00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
expires at the end of the fiscal federal
 
00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
year that would be september 30th
 
00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
and so uh we're looking for a hundred
 
00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
and twenty thousand dollars for each of
 
00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
our fiscal years that would mean ninety
 
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to the remainder of
 
00:38:50.829 --> 00:38:50.839 align:start position:0%
fiscal uh
 
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
22 and into 120 000 additional for 23.
 
00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:58.079 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note also states that uh
 
00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
those funds we're not certain whether we
 
00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
would use them equally in each of the
 
00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
two years
 
00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
uh so we leave that up to the training
 
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
folks at police standards and training
 
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
and to nami as they organize the
 
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
curriculum to continue to train more and
 
00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
more of our police officers in mental
 
00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
health intervention in situations
 
00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
that would prevent the use of deadly
 
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
force and with answer i'll take any
 
00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:21.670 align:start position:0%
force and with answer i'll take any
questions

00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:27.270 align:start position:0%
 
why

00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
a separate bill as opposed to just
 
00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:31.839 align:start position:0%
including it in the budget or in the
 
00:39:35.349 --> 00:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
provisions of house bill 2.
 
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
yeah i was approached by by ken norton
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
over at nanny uh to bring this in
 
00:39:43.109 --> 00:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
as a separate provision and i think at
 
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
the at the end of the day down the road
 
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to try to make it a
 
00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
permanent part of the budget
 
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
it's coming off of federal funding and
 
00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
going into state funding at this point
 
00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
in time
 
00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
but it's money that i believe is well
 
00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:57.190 align:start position:0%
but it's money that i believe is well
spent

00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
are there other questions for senator
 
00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:02.470 align:start position:0%
are there other questions for senator
gaida

00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
see none
 
00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony today
 
00:40:07.349 --> 00:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:17.349 --> 00:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
senator khan
 
00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
signed up to testify but i don't see him
 
00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
senator khan if you're there you could
 
00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
i don't see
 
00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
the next person to
 
00:40:42.309 --> 00:40:42.319 align:start position:0%
testify would be
 
00:40:45.829 --> 00:40:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:50.069 --> 00:40:50.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:52.640 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is diana fenton
 
00:40:56.309 --> 00:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
i'm an attorney with the department of
 
00:40:59.109 --> 00:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
education uh as a quick aside i did just
 
00:41:01.589 --> 00:41:01.599 align:start position:0%
send a text to senator khan letting him
 
00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
know that
 
00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
he's been sought after in house
 
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
judiciary and i'm sure he will join us
 
00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
soon uh thank you members of the
 
00:41:10.309 --> 00:41:10.319 align:start position:0%
committee it is a pleasure to be here
 
00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
today in front of you my testimony
 
00:41:15.829 --> 00:41:15.839 align:start position:0%
concerns section 8 of this bill
 
00:41:17.349 --> 00:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
as it pertains to school employee and
 
00:41:19.349 --> 00:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
school volunteer criminal history
 
00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
background checks
 
00:41:25.589 --> 00:41:25.599 align:start position:0%
this bill would amend rsa 189
 
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
colon 13a
 
00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
and that is the law that governs
 
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
criminal history record checks for
 
00:41:34.309 --> 00:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
teachers when they are hired by a school
 
00:41:34.319 --> 00:41:36.150 align:start position:0%
teachers when they are hired by a school
district

00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
in large part this bill provides clarity
 
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
and cleanup language to rsa 189 13 a
 
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
most notably the the bill makes uh the
 
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
time frame for the destruction of an
 
00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
individual's criminal history record
 
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
it makes that consistent it is a 60-day
 
00:41:55.589 --> 00:41:55.599 align:start position:0%
set time period
 
00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
previously the bill as it is now the law
 
00:41:59.910 --> 00:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
as it is now um
 
00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
vacillates between immediate destruction
 
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
if there is no criminal history and 60
 
00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
days if there is a criminal history
 
00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:10.079 align:start position:0%
this was causing confusion to the field
 
00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
and the department of safety also had
 
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
concerns about it just we wanted it to
 
00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
be consistent so we made that 60-day
 
00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:18.950 align:start position:0%
be consistent so we made that 60-day
window

00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
window
 
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
most notably
 
00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
part 8
 
00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
creates a new section of law rsa 189
 
00:42:29.829 --> 00:42:29.839 align:start position:0%
13 little
 
00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
this will allow the department of
 
00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:33.030 align:start position:0%
this will allow the department of
education

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
to conduct a criminal background check
 
00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
new teacher applicants
 
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
now currently
 
00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:41.270 align:start position:0%
now currently
uh

00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
when the department of education issues
 
00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
a credential to someone to teach we do
 
00:42:47.829 --> 00:42:47.839 align:start position:0%
not conduct a criminal history
 
00:42:49.589 --> 00:42:49.599 align:start position:0%
background check
 
00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
the criminal history background check is
 
00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
done as part of employment
 
00:42:57.589 --> 00:42:57.599 align:start position:0%
however last session house bill 1520 was
 
00:42:59.589 --> 00:42:59.599 align:start position:0%
passed which granted the department
 
00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
authority to conduct a criminal history
 
00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
background check on new teaching
 
00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:05.109 align:start position:0%
background check on new teaching
applicants

00:43:05.109 --> 00:43:05.119 align:start position:0%
applicants
 
00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
however there was some critical language
 
00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
that was missing from that bill
 
00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
and that language
 
00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
is the language which allows the
 
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
department of safety to disseminate the
 
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
record to the department of education
 
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
and so that's what we have incorporated
 
00:43:23.589 --> 00:43:23.599 align:start position:0%
into 189 13c
 
00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
um in that same provision
 
00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
we will also be doing the criminal
 
00:43:31.829 --> 00:43:31.839 align:start position:0%
history uh background checks on
 
00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh teaching candidates teacher prep
 
00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
candidates who are at a higher eds
 
00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
this was done in order to help higher
 
00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
eds in partnership with the field
 
00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
and um higher eds you have to understand
 
00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
that the federal background check
 
00:43:49.349 --> 00:43:49.359 align:start position:0%
is not
 
00:43:51.349 --> 00:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
it cannot be disseminated to
 
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
non-governmental entities which are
 
00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:55.910 align:start position:0%
non-governmental entities which are
private

00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
private
 
00:43:57.109 --> 00:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
higher eds
 
00:43:59.349 --> 00:43:59.359 align:start position:0%
however the department of education is a
 
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
governmental entity
 
00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
so we were hoping to partner with the
 
00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
field and
 
00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
really serve a significant need and
 
00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:08.470 align:start position:0%
really serve a significant need and
purpose

00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
by assisting our higher eds and running
 
00:44:13.109 --> 00:44:13.119 align:start position:0%
those teacher prep program candidates
 
00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
and assisting them to get into the
 
00:44:17.109 --> 00:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
placements at the districts so that they
 
00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
can fulfill their their educational
 
00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:20.630 align:start position:0%
can fulfill their their educational
requirements

00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
the third part of the bill is a study
 
00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:24.470 align:start position:0%
the third part of the bill is a study
committee

00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
to look at how the department of
 
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
education again with our
 
00:44:31.109 --> 00:44:31.119 align:start position:0%
role as a governmental entity could
 
00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
perhaps help
 
00:44:35.349 --> 00:44:35.359 align:start position:0%
non-public schools or private schools
 
00:44:37.349 --> 00:44:37.359 align:start position:0%
conduct criminal background checks on
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
employees because similar to the higher
 
00:44:39.839 --> 00:44:41.109 align:start position:0%
employees because similar to the higher
ed's

00:44:41.109 --> 00:44:41.119 align:start position:0%
ed's
 
00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
non-public schools are not
 
00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
authorized to receive the federal
 
00:44:47.589 --> 00:44:47.599 align:start position:0%
background checks they can get the new
 
00:44:49.349 --> 00:44:49.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire background checks
 
00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
but they cannot get the federal
 
00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
background checks and so this was just a
 
00:44:55.589 --> 00:44:55.599 align:start position:0%
study committee to see what if any role
 
00:44:57.910 --> 00:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
the department of education could play
 
00:44:59.190 --> 00:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
to assist
 
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
to assist in that area the underlying
 
00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
idea of course being child safety
 
00:45:06.069 --> 00:45:06.079 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time today i'm happy
 
00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
to take any questions
 
00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for
 
00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
i get
 
00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
i guess the only question with regard to
 
00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
the study committee at the end
 
00:45:23.109 --> 00:45:23.119 align:start position:0%
is that something that's been requested
 
00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
by the private schools how did how did
 
00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
that become initiated
 
00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i i can't
 
00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
speak directly to the origins of the
 
00:45:35.829 --> 00:45:35.839 align:start position:0%
study committee i know that was um
 
00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
something that senator khan was
 
00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
interested in doing so i will defer to
 
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
him to talk about how this came about
 
00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
but i i know that senator khan and i had
 
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
um a lot of discussions at is kind of
 
00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
how to best utilize the department's
 
00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
authority as a governmental agency and
 
00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
how we can assist the field
 
00:45:56.309 --> 00:45:56.319 align:start position:0%
i don't know if it was the non-publics
 
00:45:58.390 --> 00:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
that requested that study committee
 
00:46:01.589 --> 00:46:01.599 align:start position:0%
um but i do know that the underlying
 
00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
concern was uh was child safety so i
 
00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
will defer to senator khan and i'm sure
 
00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
and i guess uh
 
00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
just another question are there are
 
00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
there any parts of this bill
 
00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
that this session were heard by the
 
00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
house previously
 
00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:21.829 align:start position:0%
house previously
and

00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:21.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
and and not look favorably upon
 
00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
my understanding of the kind of
 
00:46:29.349 --> 00:46:29.359 align:start position:0%
procedural history of this bill if you
 
00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
will is it was in senate judiciary and
 
00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
then came over obviously to house
 
00:46:36.309 --> 00:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
judiciary to the best of my knowledge
 
00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
this has not been in senate education
 
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
nor has it been in house education
 
00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:46.720 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions yes
 
00:46:49.829 --> 00:46:49.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you the
 
00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
attorney founded i'm just curious that
 
00:46:58.069 --> 00:46:58.079 align:start position:0%
just seems crazy to me personally that
 
00:46:58.079 --> 00:46:59.349 align:start position:0%
just seems crazy to me personally that
there

00:46:59.349 --> 00:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:47:01.829 --> 00:47:01.839 align:start position:0%
you can have someone come in as a
 
00:47:01.839 --> 00:47:03.990 align:start position:0%
you can have someone come in as a
substitute

00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
substitute
 
00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
and not have had a background check done
 
00:47:09.589 --> 00:47:09.599 align:start position:0%
until employment have there been any
 
00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:11.839 align:start position:0%
issues with that
 
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
in the past that that's why this is
 
00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i'm not aware
 
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
of any issues
 
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily i think this is just an
 
00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
issue in general
 
00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
that the department of education is
 
00:47:31.109 --> 00:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
always looking to improve ways that we
 
00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
can protect children
 
00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:33.990 align:start position:0%
can protect children
um

00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
and one way we can do that we felt was
 
00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:39.190 align:start position:0%
and one way we can do that we felt was
by

00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
not just deferring entirely to
 
00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
employment for the background checks
 
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
take a more active role in running the
 
00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
background checks when we issue a
 
00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:48.950 align:start position:0%
background checks when we issue a
credential

00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
credential
 
00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
excellent thank you thank you
 
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
representative sylvia
 
00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and uh thank you for
 
00:47:58.630 --> 00:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
taking my question is a a piece of the
 
00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
legislation that speaks of uh destroying
 
00:48:03.589 --> 00:48:03.599 align:start position:0%
records background check records uh
 
00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
what's the intention behind this
 
00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:09.750 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
so

00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:13.349 --> 00:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
currently the way the law is is
 
00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
the way the law is written is it
 
00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
provides for the immediate destruction
 
00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
of records if there is no criminal
 
00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:20.549 align:start position:0%
of records if there is no criminal
history

00:48:20.549 --> 00:48:20.559 align:start position:0%
history
 
00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:22.640 align:start position:0%
uh reported
 
00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
and it allows for 60-day
 
00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:26.790 align:start position:0%
and it allows for 60-day
uh

00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
60-day time frame to destroy the record
 
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
if there is a criminal history
 
00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:32.549 align:start position:0%
if there is a criminal history
and

00:48:32.549 --> 00:48:32.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:34.549 --> 00:48:34.559 align:start position:0%
we wanted to just make it a little
 
00:48:36.549 --> 00:48:36.559 align:start position:0%
clearer get rid of that difference or
 
00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
discrepancy if you will and just have
 
00:48:41.829 --> 00:48:41.839 align:start position:0%
this 60-day time frame window
 
00:48:44.069 --> 00:48:44.079 align:start position:0%
i also think in my discussions with the
 
00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
department of safety and i don't want to
 
00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
speak on their behalf but
 
00:48:50.069 --> 00:48:50.079 align:start position:0%
um i think it it helps
 
00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
them as well and i think the department
 
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
of education is the only state agency
 
00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
that had that difference those different
 
00:48:59.910 --> 00:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
time frame windows so we just went with
 
00:49:01.109 --> 00:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
60 days
 
00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
based on our discussions with the
 
00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
department of safety to just make it
 
00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
clear and consistent across the board
 
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:15.349 --> 00:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you for your testimony
 
00:49:15.359 --> 00:49:16.549 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you for your testimony
today

thank you very much

00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
greetings chairman gordon
 
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
good morning senator
 
00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh
 
00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:35.910 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh
this

00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:49:38.549 --> 00:49:38.559 align:start position:0%
worked out very well
 
00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh you've heard from uh attorney fenton
 
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
and been able to ask her questions and
 
00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh the department of education has been
 
00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:47.829 align:start position:0%
uh the department of education has been
intimately

00:49:47.829 --> 00:49:47.839 align:start position:0%
intimately
 
00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
involved in the writing of this
 
00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:52.069 align:start position:0%
involved in the writing of this
legislation

00:49:52.069 --> 00:49:52.079 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh which they see as key to
 
00:49:58.549 --> 00:49:58.559 align:start position:0%
conducting the background checks for
 
00:50:00.069 --> 00:50:00.079 align:start position:0%
uh schools
 
00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
so uh i'm glad to answer your questions
 
00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
i i will address the
 
00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:06.150 align:start position:0%
i i will address the
the

00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:50:08.069 --> 00:50:08.079 align:start position:0%
private school study
 
00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh committee
 
00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:10.790 align:start position:0%
uh committee
um

00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:14.069 --> 00:50:14.079 align:start position:0%
i think we are all familiar with some
 
00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
very high profile
 
00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
uh private school
 
00:50:18.319 --> 00:50:19.109 align:start position:0%
uh private school
uh

00:50:19.109 --> 00:50:19.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:50:21.109 --> 00:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
cases uh
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
that have arisen in the last
 
00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
half dozen years and uh this is not
 
00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
presuming an outcome
 
00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
this is offering
 
00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:31.990 align:start position:0%
this is offering
uh

00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:50:34.069 --> 00:50:34.079 align:start position:0%
a collaboration with
 
00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
the private schools
 
00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
that if there is a role that the
 
00:50:40.549 --> 00:50:40.559 align:start position:0%
department of education can play in
 
00:50:42.549 --> 00:50:42.559 align:start position:0%
conducting those background checks so
 
00:50:44.069 --> 00:50:44.079 align:start position:0%
that they can provide
 
00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
the information
 
00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
to private schools much the same way
 
00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
that ms fenton described
 
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
doing that for colleges for their
 
00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839 align:start position:0%
uh teacher preparation programs
 
00:50:57.839 --> 00:50:59.589 align:start position:0%
uh teacher preparation programs
then

00:50:59.589 --> 00:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
then we would come forward with some
 
00:51:04.309 --> 00:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
legislation if uh parties agreed that
 
00:51:06.549 --> 00:51:06.559 align:start position:0%
this would be a benefit
 
00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
but this is not presuming an outcome to
 
00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:10.549 align:start position:0%
but this is not presuming an outcome to
that

00:51:10.549 --> 00:51:10.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
senator carter i was wondering if on the
 
00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
study committee we could make it three
 
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
i would leave that to the committee to
 
00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:37.109 align:start position:0%
i would leave that to the committee to
make

00:51:37.109 --> 00:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
make
 
00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
their best recommendations on it clearly
 
00:51:42.549 --> 00:51:42.559 align:start position:0%
the the house with the number and the
 
00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
talent of people that you have to to
 
00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
select from
 
00:51:49.109 --> 00:51:49.119 align:start position:0%
uh is much deeper than uh what we in the
 
00:51:51.829 --> 00:51:51.839 align:start position:0%
senate have
 
00:51:55.270 --> 00:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
any other questions for senator khan
 
00:51:57.750 --> 00:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
yes representative chase
 
00:51:59.510 --> 00:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you senator
 
00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
kahn for taking my question i'm just
 
00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
curious and i had when i was reading
 
00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
through this too about the um
 
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
destroying of records
 
00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
i understand you have the right to do
 
00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
that but what is the reason for it
 
00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
especially if somebody is um actually
 
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
has offenses and that
 
00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
is information that
 
00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
kind of a right to know you know i mean
 
00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
enough other other schools should know
 
00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
about or families should know about what
 
00:52:29.109 --> 00:52:29.119 align:start position:0%
why would they be destroyed
 
00:52:29.119 --> 00:52:30.069 align:start position:0%
why would they be destroyed
yes

00:52:30.069 --> 00:52:30.079 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
thanks for that question i hope ms
 
00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
fenton is still on the line in case
 
00:52:36.549 --> 00:52:36.559 align:start position:0%
there's anything that i fail to
 
00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
answer correctly here but but
 
00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
while that is destroyed by the local
 
00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
district it is the local district's
 
00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility to be sharing
 
00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
any offenses
 
00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
in section 5 of 189
 
00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:52.630 align:start position:0%
in section 5 of 189
that

00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:52.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
any offenses
 
00:52:56.710 --> 00:52:56.720 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:52:58.829 --> 00:52:58.839 align:start position:0%
department of education and the
 
00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner so prior to any destruction
 
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh and and that's that the records don't
 
00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:06.549 align:start position:0%
uh and and that's that the records don't
uh

00:53:06.549 --> 00:53:06.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:06.559 --> 00:53:07.670 align:start position:0%
uh
uh

00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
aren't revealed to
 
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh people who don't have a reason to to
 
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
look at those
 
00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
the reason for background check is
 
00:53:17.349 --> 00:53:17.359 align:start position:0%
initial employment
 
00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
and and then
 
00:53:21.109 --> 00:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
the department of education retains that
 
00:53:21.119 --> 00:53:22.230 align:start position:0%
the department of education retains that
information

00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh should there be any further initial
 
00:53:28.069 --> 00:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
employment requests on that person by
 
00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
another district
 
00:53:34.790 --> 00:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:36.990 align:start position:0%

00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:56:57.510 --> 00:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
testify regarding these two parts
 
00:57:00.069 --> 00:57:00.079 align:start position:0%
as to part two
 
00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
as you have heard
 
00:57:04.309 --> 00:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
from the bill's sponsor
 
00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
the purpose of part two is to allow
 
00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
remote real estate closings and the
 
00:57:10.390 --> 00:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
legislation is based on model statutes
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
the revised uniform law notorious acts
 
00:57:14.069 --> 00:57:14.079 align:start position:0%
and their uniform real property
 
00:57:16.309 --> 00:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
electronic recording act that have been
 
00:57:18.549 --> 00:57:18.559 align:start position:0%
enacted in many other states
 
00:57:20.309 --> 00:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
you'll hear more testimony from other
 
00:57:21.829 --> 00:57:21.839 align:start position:0%
people on those
 
00:57:25.109 --> 00:57:25.119 align:start position:0%
on the the statute in general
 
00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
those statutes in general but i'm here
 
00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
to testify primarily
 
00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
on two small sections of part two
 
00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
part two also includes provisions to
 
00:57:37.349 --> 00:57:37.359 align:start position:0%
make legislation passed last summer
 
00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
authorizing remote notarization of
 
00:57:41.109 --> 00:57:41.119 align:start position:0%
estate planning documents
 
00:57:44.069 --> 00:57:44.079 align:start position:0%
such as wills and trusts and remote
 
00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
witnessing of wills permanent
 
00:57:49.349 --> 00:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
the current statute expires when the
 
00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
open 19 state of emergency ends
 
00:57:56.710 --> 00:57:56.720 align:start position:0%
but this statute as uh passed last year
 
00:57:58.150 --> 00:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
there were two
 
00:57:59.829 --> 00:57:59.839 align:start position:0%
statutes that were amended to allow us
 
00:58:01.109 --> 00:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
to do this
 
00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
has really provided estate planners new
 
00:58:05.349 --> 00:58:05.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire state planners with the
 
00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
ability to serve many clients during the
 
00:58:08.789 --> 00:58:08.799 align:start position:0%
pandemic who would otherwise not have
 
00:58:10.789 --> 00:58:10.799 align:start position:0%
completed their estate plans due to
 
00:58:13.349 --> 00:58:13.359 align:start position:0%
medical concerns and also it allowed us
 
00:58:15.270 --> 00:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
to keep many others safe during the
 
00:58:16.710 --> 00:58:16.720 align:start position:0%
process of signing estate planning
 
00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:18.230 align:start position:0%
process of signing estate planning
documents

00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
documents
 
00:58:20.069 --> 00:58:20.079 align:start position:0%
during which you need a notary for most
 
00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
of them you need a notary and two
 
00:58:23.190 --> 00:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
witnesses so it's kind of a big group of
 
00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:25.030 align:start position:0%
witnesses so it's kind of a big group of
people

00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:27.200 align:start position:0%
and although many of us have found
 
00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
creative ways to
 
00:58:31.349 --> 00:58:31.359 align:start position:0%
function during the pandemic meeting
 
00:58:31.359 --> 00:58:33.270 align:start position:0%
function during the pandemic meeting
outside

00:58:33.270 --> 00:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
outside
 
00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
and all sorts of other
 
00:58:36.549 --> 00:58:36.559 align:start position:0%
creative things to do mostly meeting
 
00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
outside but in large rooms or whatever
 
00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
there are many estate planning clients
 
00:58:42.549 --> 00:58:42.559 align:start position:0%
who would not have
 
00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
been able to sign documents
 
00:58:47.829 --> 00:58:47.839 align:start position:0%
that were able to sign them because we
 
00:58:50.870 --> 00:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
were able very safely based on how these
 
00:58:53.349 --> 00:58:53.359 align:start position:0%
two amendments were drafted last year
 
00:58:55.030 --> 00:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
and passed
 
00:58:57.270 --> 00:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
to assist them to sign their documents
 
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
remotely so this statute part two of the
 
00:59:04.549 --> 00:59:04.559 align:start position:0%
statute also includes provisions to make
 
00:59:04.559 --> 00:59:06.390 align:start position:0%
statute also includes provisions to make
those

00:59:06.390 --> 00:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:59:08.950 --> 00:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
provisions permanent and that's that's
 
00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
what i'm supporting
 
00:59:12.870 --> 00:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
to allow us to continue to use these
 
00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
there's going to be many other
 
00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
there's going to be many other health
 
00:59:19.349 --> 00:59:19.359 align:start position:0%
situations that clients are in and many
 
00:59:21.670 --> 00:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
times it is very difficult to get into
 
00:59:23.670 --> 00:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
hospitals or to get into nursing homes
 
00:59:26.950 --> 00:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
to assist people and this is a really
 
00:59:29.349 --> 00:59:29.359 align:start position:0%
wonderful tool
 
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
the other part of my testimony is in
 
00:59:33.510 --> 00:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
support of part 7.
 
00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
as you heard
 
00:59:36.870 --> 00:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
there is a group of estate planning
 
00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:38.230 align:start position:0%
there is a group of estate planning
attorneys

00:59:38.230 --> 00:59:38.240 align:start position:0%
attorneys
 
00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
and probate practitioners who
 
00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:42.640 align:start position:0%
we've been meeting
 
00:59:45.109 --> 00:59:45.119 align:start position:0%
we just meet
 
00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
over the last few years and looking at
 
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
different parts of the practice that
 
00:59:53.829 --> 00:59:53.839 align:start position:0%
could use improvement um this part seven
 
00:59:56.230 --> 00:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
contains several
 
01:00:00.069 --> 01:00:00.079 align:start position:0%
of those um amendments and
 
01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
that we would
 
01:00:02.789 --> 01:00:02.799 align:start position:0%
like to have
 
01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
made and this bill was passed last year
 
01:00:07.589 --> 01:00:07.599 align:start position:0%
as and was put in as part of a
 
01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
omnibus bill that was then vetoed
 
01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
so the um
 
01:00:13.829 --> 01:00:13.839 align:start position:0%
this part simplifies the probate
 
01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
administration it expands the simplified
 
01:00:16.789 --> 01:00:16.799 align:start position:0%
probate administration known as waiver
 
01:00:18.390 --> 01:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
of administration
 
01:00:19.829 --> 01:00:19.839 align:start position:0%
and makes several corrections to the
 
01:00:21.349 --> 01:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
intestines and durable power of attorney
 
01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
statutes those are really just pretty
 
01:00:26.309 --> 01:00:26.319 align:start position:0%
much typos and several clarifications
 
01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:27.680 align:start position:0%
and it also updates the uniform
 
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
displaying of property interest act to a
 
01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
more current um act ours is very very
 
01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:34.230 align:start position:0%
more current um act ours is very very
old

01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:34.240 align:start position:0%
old
 
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
um um as i said these changes were
 
01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
passed by the senate last year but
 
01:00:40.309 --> 01:00:40.319 align:start position:0%
unfortunately they were
 
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
they were um part of the covid um
 
01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
issues with vetoes and omnibus bills and
 
01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:49.589 align:start position:0%
issues with vetoes and omnibus bills and
um

01:00:49.589 --> 01:00:49.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:49.599 --> 01:00:50.470 align:start position:0%
um
we

01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
as part of our process when we look at
 
01:00:55.990 --> 01:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
potential statutes that affect the
 
01:00:59.510 --> 01:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
probate practice we contact judge king
 
01:01:01.270 --> 01:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
to make sure that what we are doing is
 
01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
consistent with what the court would
 
01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:05.839 align:start position:0%
approve and he is fully supportive
 
01:01:05.839 --> 01:01:06.870 align:start position:0%
approve and he is fully supportive
of

01:01:06.870 --> 01:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
these changes especially the changes to
 
01:01:10.870 --> 01:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
the waiver of administration statute
 
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
that directly impact the court the
 
01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
waiver of administration changes will
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
simplify the probate process for new
 
01:01:19.589 --> 01:01:19.599 align:start position:0%
hampshire citizens while continuing the
 
01:01:21.349 --> 01:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
oversight of the court if necessary
 
01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
which is really it's a great system we
 
01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
have here
 
01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
many states have fully unsupervised
 
01:01:29.910 --> 01:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
probate we don't have that we have
 
01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
unsupervised probate unless the port
 
01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:33.200 align:start position:0%
needs to get involved
 
01:01:35.589 --> 01:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
so this will save time and money for
 
01:01:37.109 --> 01:01:37.119 align:start position:0%
both new hampshire citizens and new
 
01:01:39.270 --> 01:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire circuit court probate probate
 
01:01:41.109 --> 01:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
division and we
 
01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
fully support passage thank you for your
 
01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:44.309 align:start position:0%

and next person to testify would be
 
01:02:09.270 --> 01:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:14.549 --> 01:02:14.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
my name is robert wells i live in
 
01:02:18.549 --> 01:02:18.559 align:start position:0%
hopkinton new hampshire and i've been
 
01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
practicing in the field of trust and
 
01:02:23.109 --> 01:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
state law for 50 years
 
01:02:23.119 --> 01:02:23.990 align:start position:0%
state law for 50 years
uh

01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
with respect to what ginger sheen just
 
01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
testified i do not want to repeat what
 
01:02:31.750 --> 01:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
she said but i will generally support
 
01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
all of her comments both with section 2
 
01:02:36.549 --> 01:02:36.559 align:start position:0%
and section 7.
 
01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:40.799 align:start position:0%
with respect to section 7 this goes back
 
01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
almost four years that we've been
 
01:02:44.230 --> 01:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
working with judge king
 
01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh to make the changes for waiver of
 
01:02:49.349 --> 01:02:49.359 align:start position:0%
probate and as ginger indicated it is a
 
01:02:51.190 --> 01:02:51.200 align:start position:0%
savings for both
 
01:02:55.430 --> 01:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
the court as well as our clients
 
01:02:58.069 --> 01:02:58.079 align:start position:0%
and i can give you a specific example i
 
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
have a will now where their two children
 
01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
are the beneficiaries and the two
 
01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
children are the executors waiver of
 
01:03:07.109 --> 01:03:07.119 align:start position:0%
probate is not available
 
01:03:07.119 --> 01:03:08.150 align:start position:0%
probate is not available
because

01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:03:10.789 --> 01:03:10.799 align:start position:0%
under current law has to be a single
 
01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:12.799 align:start position:0%
executor and a single person single
 
01:03:12.799 --> 01:03:14.069 align:start position:0%
executor and a single person single
beneficiary

01:03:14.069 --> 01:03:14.079 align:start position:0%
beneficiary
 
01:03:15.829 --> 01:03:15.839 align:start position:0%
so with that we have to go through full
 
01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
probate unnecessarily with this new
 
01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:19.109 align:start position:0%
probate unnecessarily with this new
provision

01:03:19.109 --> 01:03:19.119 align:start position:0%
provision
 
01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh new provisions as is set forth in
 
01:03:23.109 --> 01:03:23.119 align:start position:0%
section seven this
 
01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
greatly simplifies matter one of the
 
01:03:28.309 --> 01:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
other provisions in this provides that a
 
01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
probate judge may in his discretion or
 
01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
her discretion
 
01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
allow waiver of probate and that can
 
01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
happen sometimes when the only probate
 
01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
asset for example is an automobile and a
 
01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
single person has died right now we have
 
01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
to go through full probate to get the
 
01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:45.270 align:start position:0%
to go through full probate to get the
car

01:03:45.270 --> 01:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
car
 
01:03:47.029 --> 01:03:47.039 align:start position:0%
into a trust when we have a pour over
 
01:03:49.829 --> 01:03:49.839 align:start position:0%
will into a revocable trust
 
01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
with respect to section two um my
 
01:03:55.029 --> 01:03:55.039 align:start position:0%
experience in dealing with the
 
01:03:57.430 --> 01:03:57.440 align:start position:0%
zoom execution of documents
 
01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
has been uh
 
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
life-changing in many ways having
 
01:04:04.870 --> 01:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
practiced for so long with having to
 
01:04:07.829 --> 01:04:07.839 align:start position:0%
meet people in rooms and conferences
 
01:04:09.430 --> 01:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
many times people had to travel great
 
01:04:12.150 --> 01:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
distances sometimes people were not well
 
01:04:14.230 --> 01:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
and what we have found with respect to
 
01:04:16.230 --> 01:04:16.240 align:start position:0%
the remote signing under the emergency
 
01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
order is great uh satisfaction from the
 
01:04:22.470 --> 01:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
client base uh with respect to the
 
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
execution of these documents and
 
01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
typically only when i would call
 
01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
ordinary documents if there is an
 
01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
exclusion of a child
 
01:04:33.349 --> 01:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
in an estate plan or other problems that
 
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
could create issues most attorneys are
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
still insisting on face-to-face uh
 
01:04:41.270 --> 01:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
execution of those documents but for all
 
01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
practical purposes what i will refer to
 
01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
as our somewhat standard
 
01:04:47.029 --> 01:04:47.039 align:start position:0%
documents uh
 
01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
this has worked just uh
 
01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
i can't express myself
 
01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
how happy i have been able to continue
 
01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
to work with zoom for advancing my
 
01:04:58.870 --> 01:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
clients interests happy to answer any
 
01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:00.230 align:start position:0%
clients interests happy to answer any
questions

01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:05:02.230 --> 01:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
any questions returning well yes
 
01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
attorney mcgrane
 
01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:06.079 align:start position:0%
not an attorney
 
01:05:08.710 --> 01:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
yes representative mclean excuse me i
 
01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
 
01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:15.839 align:start position:0%
for me um probate law is very confusing
 
01:05:17.589 --> 01:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
so just bear with me
 
01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
with the waiver
 
01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
of administration the case that you
 
01:05:23.910 --> 01:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
cited where you're dealing with a case
 
01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
where you have two heirs
 
01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:28.559 align:start position:0%
and the person died
 
01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
intestate so in the past
 
01:05:35.029 --> 01:05:35.039 align:start position:0%
that would have to go to probate now it
 
01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
does not
 
01:05:39.510 --> 01:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
is am i correct in what you were saying
 
01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
what happens is that uh is respect to
 
01:05:43.510 --> 01:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
both whether you have a will or
 
01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
intestines either one the new statute
 
01:05:47.029 --> 01:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
applies to both
 
01:05:49.109 --> 01:05:49.119 align:start position:0%
so if you have two
 
01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
children who are the co-executors named
 
01:05:53.910 --> 01:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
in the will and they are the
 
01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:55.430 align:start position:0%
in the will and they are the
beneficiaries

01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries
 
01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:57.839 align:start position:0%
currently waiver of probate is not
 
01:05:57.839 --> 01:05:59.190 align:start position:0%
currently waiver of probate is not
available

01:05:59.190 --> 01:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:06:02.549 --> 01:06:02.559 align:start position:0%
with the new statute assuming it passes
 
01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:04.640 align:start position:0%
now what will happen is a simplified
 
01:06:08.710 --> 01:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
process by which they simply apply for a
 
01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
petition to have themselves appointed as
 
01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
executors and with that document they
 
01:06:17.349 --> 01:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
are able to advance all aspects of the
 
01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
transfer of assets without filing an
 
01:06:21.990 --> 01:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
inventory without filing a bond
 
01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:22.789 align:start position:0%
inventory without filing a bond
uh

01:06:22.789 --> 01:06:22.799 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:24.640 align:start position:0%
and without any court supervision
 
01:06:26.710 --> 01:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
because why should two people who are in
 
01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
charge who are the beneficiaries why
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
does the court have to become involved
 
01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
and that would be true for intestacy or
 
01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:36.640 align:start position:0%
with respect to test date if you have
 
01:06:38.470 --> 01:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
say five or six children
 
01:06:41.349 --> 01:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
and they are all beneficiaries uh under
 
01:06:43.109 --> 01:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
those circumstances
 
01:06:45.589 --> 01:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
the five or six beneficiaries can agree
 
01:06:47.349 --> 01:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
that one or two of the children could
 
01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
serve as executors and in that case in
 
01:06:54.069 --> 01:06:54.079 align:start position:0%
addition waiver of probate would apply
 
01:06:55.990 --> 01:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
yes representative mclean just a quick
 
01:06:59.109 --> 01:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
follow-up and again i'm ignorant so if
 
01:06:59.119 --> 01:07:00.390 align:start position:0%
follow-up and again i'm ignorant so if
um

01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:02.549 --> 01:07:02.559 align:start position:0%
in the case of
 
01:07:05.029 --> 01:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
an intestacy where you're trying to
 
01:07:05.039 --> 01:07:06.230 align:start position:0%
an intestacy where you're trying to
understand

01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
i thought probate was to determine who
 
01:07:10.150 --> 01:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
are the claimants so maybe it's not
 
01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
clear that there are the five claimants
 
01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
and so maybe there's
 
01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
um a sixth person
 
01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
but if you if you can wave it does that
 
01:07:21.190 --> 01:07:21.200 align:start position:0%
not give the opportunity for that to go
 
01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:22.470 align:start position:0%
not give the opportunity for that to go
forward

01:07:22.470 --> 01:07:22.480 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:07:25.109 --> 01:07:25.119 align:start position:0%
well that is not correct a waiver of the
 
01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
intestine is determined by state law
 
01:07:28.950 --> 01:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
and state law determines who the
 
01:07:30.789 --> 01:07:30.799 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries are so it's always clear
 
01:07:33.270 --> 01:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
who the beneficiaries are okay
 
01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
i'll thank you for clarifying that
 
01:07:37.109 --> 01:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for
 
01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:39.760 align:start position:0%

01:09:56.229 --> 01:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time and the opportunity
 
01:09:58.229 --> 01:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
to speak my name is anna goulet
 
01:09:59.750 --> 01:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
zimmerman and i'm an attorney in
 
01:10:01.350 --> 01:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
manchester and a member of the new
 
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire law alliance
 
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
only a small part of my practice is
 
01:10:07.030 --> 01:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
currently family law but i've been
 
01:10:08.310 --> 01:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
involved with
 
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
this bill since its inception working
 
01:10:12.149 --> 01:10:12.159 align:start position:0%
with a bipartisan group of family law
 
01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
attorneys and i've stayed involved as
 
01:10:16.390 --> 01:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
i've always thought we should be doing
 
01:10:18.709 --> 01:10:18.719 align:start position:0%
whatever we can to help resolve family
 
01:10:21.669 --> 01:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
law matters fairly and amicably and with
 
01:10:23.590 --> 01:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
a minimum of damage to the children and
 
01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
family impacted this is not always
 
01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
possible but if both parties are willing
 
01:10:29.990 --> 01:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
this law would allow another process
 
01:10:32.070 --> 01:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
what would codify another process
 
01:10:34.390 --> 01:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
whereby this can happen
 
01:10:36.149 --> 01:10:36.159 align:start position:0%
as senator carson said this is a
 
01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
voluntary alternative dispute process
 
01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
both parties would need to need to agree
 
01:10:43.189 --> 01:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
to participate so how does it work and
 
01:10:45.189 --> 01:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
what is collaborative what law
 
01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
it's basically a process whereby
 
01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
everyone commits to the collaborative
 
01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
process they sign a contract an
 
01:10:52.709 --> 01:10:52.719 align:start position:0%
agreement at the beginning they have
 
01:10:54.630 --> 01:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
attorneys who or they should have
 
01:10:55.830 --> 01:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
attorneys who are trained in
 
01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
collaborative law
 
01:11:00.070 --> 01:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
there's usually a coach who's like a
 
01:11:02.070 --> 01:11:02.080 align:start position:0%
mental health provider a counselor who
 
01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:03.750 align:start position:0%
mental health provider a counselor who
helps

01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
helps
 
01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
kind of facilitate discussions work
 
01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
through difficult issues things like
 
01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:08.709 align:start position:0%
through difficult issues things like
that

01:11:08.709 --> 01:11:08.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:11:10.950 --> 01:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
and if the process falls apart before
 
01:11:12.630 --> 01:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
going to court everyone needs to get a
 
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
new attorney so everybody's committing
 
01:11:15.990 --> 01:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
at the beginning to
 
01:11:18.550 --> 01:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
a resolution outside of court with the
 
01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
exception of course that the court still
 
01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
retains the right to have a final
 
01:11:26.310 --> 01:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
overview of the family law agreements
 
01:11:28.950 --> 01:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
and to approve those
 
01:11:31.669 --> 01:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
the purpose is to have everybody working
 
01:11:34.709 --> 01:11:34.719 align:start position:0%
together in a way that can positively
 
01:11:34.719 --> 01:11:35.590 align:start position:0%
together in a way that can positively
reach

01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
reach
 
01:11:38.229 --> 01:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
agreed results looking at alternatives
 
01:11:40.550 --> 01:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
looking at what financial situations can
 
01:11:42.229 --> 01:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
be made working through together how to
 
01:11:44.630 --> 01:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
best address parenting issues
 
01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
it's private so if people don't want to
 
01:11:49.189 --> 01:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
be in court discussing their finances
 
01:11:51.189 --> 01:11:51.199 align:start position:0%
and things like that they can do it in
 
01:11:52.870 --> 01:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
this type of a setting
 
01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
it allows a detailed analysis of a bunch
 
01:11:57.030 --> 01:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
of different options that might not be
 
01:11:59.910 --> 01:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
available in a traditional trial setting
 
01:12:01.189 --> 01:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
01:12:03.030 --> 01:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
having a financial planner work through
 
01:12:04.709 --> 01:12:04.719 align:start position:0%
with both parties what their futures
 
01:12:06.950 --> 01:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
might look like under certain scenarios
 
01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
things like that and the idea is to
 
01:12:12.630 --> 01:12:12.640 align:start position:0%
really reduce litigation and conflict um
 
01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
because everybody signed in on the
 
01:12:16.470 --> 01:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
process the attorneys can't be saying
 
01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
you know well forget this i'm just gonna
 
01:12:20.709 --> 01:12:20.719 align:start position:0%
go to court tomorrow um there are
 
01:12:22.229 --> 01:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
exceptions obviously if there's
 
01:12:22.239 --> 01:12:23.590 align:start position:0%
exceptions obviously if there's
emergencies

01:12:23.590 --> 01:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
emergencies
 
01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:24.950 align:start position:0%
emergencies
um

01:12:24.950 --> 01:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:26.630 --> 01:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
you know there's a process you'll see in
 
01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
the bill to look for and make sure
 
01:12:30.709 --> 01:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
there's no domestic violence issues or
 
01:12:32.550 --> 01:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
that everybody's in a safe situation
 
01:12:34.229 --> 01:12:34.239 align:start position:0%
when we're doing this
 
01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh and this is a process that is in pro
 
01:12:38.790 --> 01:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
is in practice right now
 
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
um but we're asking to have it codified
 
01:12:43.189 --> 01:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
because i think we think it's important
 
01:12:44.950 --> 01:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
that everyone be following by the same
 
01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
rules that everyone agree that the
 
01:12:50.149 --> 01:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
agreements reached can be enforced just
 
01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
like they would be if we were in
 
01:12:54.229 --> 01:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
mediation that the process remains
 
01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
confidential because although we're
 
01:12:58.149 --> 01:12:58.159 align:start position:0%
saying it's confidential you know that's
 
01:12:59.990 --> 01:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
just the participants you know right now
 
01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
there's not a way to necessarily require
 
01:13:06.070 --> 01:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
that or enforce that um in court and
 
01:13:08.470 --> 01:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
it's that in that regard it's very like
 
01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
much like the current mediation process
 
01:13:12.390 --> 01:13:12.400 align:start position:0%
except there's multiple people usually
 
01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
involved because we do often have
 
01:13:17.189 --> 01:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
financial planners and the coach
 
01:13:19.350 --> 01:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
in my experience these are my favorite
 
01:13:22.149 --> 01:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
cases because i come away with everyone
 
01:13:24.790 --> 01:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
feeling okay about the results everyone
 
01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
has kind of a vested interest in
 
01:13:29.350 --> 01:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
what did we reach we work this out
 
01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
together and it's a great feeling if
 
01:13:33.350 --> 01:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
you're a family law attorney and one you
 
01:13:35.830 --> 01:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
don't get very often to walk away from a
 
01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
case like that i think it's good for
 
01:13:39.910 --> 01:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
families i think it's good for
 
01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
individuals i think it's good for the
 
01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
court because it reduces litigation for
 
01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
people who don't want to do it they
 
01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
don't have to do it it's not a process
 
01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
anyone's being required to do
 
01:13:52.870 --> 01:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
and i'd ask for your support of the bill
 
01:13:56.950 --> 01:13:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:59.350 --> 01:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
okay uh attorney
 
01:14:02.709 --> 01:14:02.719 align:start position:0%
representative macbeth sorry
 
01:14:04.630 --> 01:14:04.640 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you mr chairman and
 
01:14:05.990 --> 01:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:14:08.470 --> 01:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
attorney zimmerman um in full disclosure
 
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
i support this bill i've been a member
 
01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire collaborative law
 
01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
alliance and they're also some of my
 
01:14:14.790 --> 01:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
favorite cases
 
01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
i have i do have three questions um i
 
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to know if participants um in the
 
01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:22.719 align:start position:0%
collaborative process if the parties are
 
01:14:25.189 --> 01:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
still required to provide the financial
 
01:14:27.910 --> 01:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
disclosures um that are required under
 
01:14:30.910 --> 01:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
family rule 2 um
 
01:14:33.030 --> 01:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
1.25 a
 
01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
so i think the answer is just like um
 
01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
that rule they i mean they normally are
 
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
normally we're exchanging far more
 
01:14:42.950 --> 01:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
than that but i think just like that
 
01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
rule the parties could agree to waive or
 
01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
reduce what's exchanged you know under
 
01:14:49.030 --> 01:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
the current rules we can agree just to
 
01:14:50.870 --> 01:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
exchange a financial affidavit for
 
01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:51.990 align:start position:0%
exchange a financial affidavit for
example

01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:14:53.830 --> 01:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
the courts are still going to require as
 
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
part of the filings of financial
 
01:14:58.070 --> 01:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
affidavit before they approve any any
 
01:14:58.080 --> 01:14:58.950 align:start position:0%
affidavit before they approve any any
any

01:14:58.950 --> 01:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:00.070 align:start position:0%
any
um

01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:01.669 --> 01:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
any of the agreements any parenting
 
01:15:03.030 --> 01:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
plans any you know that's just a
 
01:15:05.189 --> 01:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
requirement of the courts so i think the
 
01:15:06.550 --> 01:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
answer is
 
01:15:08.790 --> 01:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
yes but the courts you know just like in
 
01:15:11.830 --> 01:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
court people could agree to um
 
01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
wave part or all of that my experience
 
01:15:16.790 --> 01:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
has been that usually more is exchanged
 
01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:24.550 --> 01:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
i have a follow-up yep thank you mr
 
01:15:26.790 --> 01:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
chair um and the other issue is what
 
01:15:28.149 --> 01:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
about um
 
01:15:29.910 --> 01:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
the you know the anti-hypothecation
 
01:15:32.070 --> 01:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
clause and also the um
 
01:15:34.790 --> 01:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
the date i mean if it's if it's outside
 
01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
of the court and it's not going to be
 
01:15:38.709 --> 01:15:38.719 align:start position:0%
brought forward what is the date then
 
01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
that is set for the separation of some
 
01:15:42.550 --> 01:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
marital property like a pension or
 
01:15:43.990 --> 01:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
something like that well maybe you're
 
01:15:45.990 --> 01:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
already six months forward
 
01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
um is is that negotiated amongst the
 
01:15:50.630 --> 01:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
parties as well as the anti-apothecation
 
01:15:52.630 --> 01:15:52.640 align:start position:0%
clause or what happens with that thank
 
01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
you i'm glad you asked that question
 
01:15:55.990 --> 01:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
because that's one of the things one of
 
01:15:57.270 --> 01:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
the issues where i think is really
 
01:15:59.030 --> 01:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
important about this law
 
01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
because i know that if i was the pension
 
01:16:04.709 --> 01:16:04.719 align:start position:0%
holder or the 401k holder i might say
 
01:16:06.630 --> 01:16:06.640 align:start position:0%
look i don't want to spend the next nine
 
01:16:08.790 --> 01:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
months negotiating out all these things
 
01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
because my pension and your interest in
 
01:16:13.189 --> 01:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
my pension is growing every day
 
01:16:15.189 --> 01:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
and the other side can say well let's
 
01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
agree then
 
01:16:18.310 --> 01:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
that for the purpose of dividing your
 
01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:19.590 align:start position:0%
that for the purpose of dividing your
pension

01:16:19.590 --> 01:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
pension
 
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
this will be the day of you know the
 
01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
same as the day of filing for example
 
01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
because right now pensions get divided
 
01:16:27.669 --> 01:16:27.679 align:start position:0%
based on when the divorce was filed
 
01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
so we agree that when this gets done the
 
01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
pension date for the person purpose of
 
01:16:34.630 --> 01:16:34.640 align:start position:0%
hodgkin's which is the main case talking
 
01:16:37.189 --> 01:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
about pensions um is the date we signed
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
this collaborative law agreement or the
 
01:16:39.830 --> 01:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
date we signed this agreement in the
 
01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:40.870 align:start position:0%
date we signed this agreement in the
process

01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
and this would allow the court that to
 
01:16:44.229 --> 01:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
be an enforceable agreement within the
 
01:16:44.239 --> 01:16:45.270 align:start position:0%
be an enforceable agreement within the
court

01:16:45.270 --> 01:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:16:47.830 --> 01:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
as opposed to just kind of uh yeah let's
 
01:16:50.630 --> 01:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
hope that hope that works
 
01:16:52.709 --> 01:16:52.719 align:start position:0%
and same with child support because no
 
01:16:54.550 --> 01:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
one wants to come back and you know
 
01:16:56.790 --> 01:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
waive child support necessarily for 10
 
01:16:58.709 --> 01:16:58.719 align:start position:0%
months if that's how long the process is
 
01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
working so that could all be built into
 
01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
the early on agreements these are the
 
01:17:04.229 --> 01:17:04.239 align:start position:0%
dates we're going to use for this this
 
01:17:07.110 --> 01:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
is what part of the process is
 
01:17:09.189 --> 01:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much no thank
 
01:17:11.830 --> 01:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
you for the questions
 
01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:17:17.110 --> 01:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
i guess the question i have is uh it
 
01:17:19.350 --> 01:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
says a collaborative lawyer means a
 
01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
lawyer who represents a party in a
 
01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:22.950 align:start position:0%
lawyer who represents a party in a
collaborative

01:17:22.950 --> 01:17:22.960 align:start position:0%
collaborative
 
01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:24.070 align:start position:0%
collaborative
process

01:17:24.070 --> 01:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
are there any
 
01:17:28.870 --> 01:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
restrictions or qualifications on
 
01:17:32.470 --> 01:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
who can be a collaborative lawyer
 
01:17:36.870 --> 01:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
so we have had training in it um i have
 
01:17:38.950 --> 01:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
i went to a continuing legal education
 
01:17:40.630 --> 01:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
course on it and i continue to have a
 
01:17:42.390 --> 01:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
certain number of
 
01:17:45.910 --> 01:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
hours each year that that we all do
 
01:17:48.310 --> 01:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
um it's not
 
01:17:51.669 --> 01:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
necessarily a requirement
 
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
that i'm aware of like there's no
 
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
overseeing body like the bar association
 
01:17:58.630 --> 01:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
or something that says that in order to
 
01:17:59.990 --> 01:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
be a member of the collaborative law
 
01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
alliance of new hampshire you do have to
 
01:18:04.390 --> 01:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
have that though and that's usually
 
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
where people are looking for attorneys
 
01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
and i know i always look to make sure
 
01:18:10.390 --> 01:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
that the attorney on the other side of
 
01:18:13.350 --> 01:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
my case is a collaboratively trained
 
01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:14.550 align:start position:0%
my case is a collaboratively trained
lawyer

01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:14.560 align:start position:0%
lawyer
 
01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
within that organization or or a similar
 
01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:18.950 align:start position:0%
within that organization or or a similar
organization

01:18:18.950 --> 01:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
organization
 
01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
part of the benefit again of the law
 
01:18:22.870 --> 01:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
would be that if there was someone
 
01:18:24.709 --> 01:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
participating who didn't have that
 
01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
process because there's not again really
 
01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
a policing agency they also now are
 
01:18:31.910 --> 01:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
bound by and have this kind of framework
 
01:18:34.229 --> 01:18:34.239 align:start position:0%
of what their what the process is and
 
01:18:36.070 --> 01:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
what they're required to do if there
 
01:18:37.830 --> 01:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
were other attorneys who you're like a
 
01:18:39.110 --> 01:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
mediator who decided they wanted to
 
01:18:40.470 --> 01:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
start doing collaborative work or
 
01:18:43.590 --> 01:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:46.229 --> 01:18:46.239 align:start position:0%
if i just maybe i'll ask the question a
 
01:18:47.669 --> 01:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
different way and that is
 
01:18:47.679 --> 01:18:50.550 align:start position:0%
different way and that is
there's

01:18:50.550 --> 01:18:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
any attorney
 
01:18:54.310 --> 01:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
could hold themselves out to be a
 
01:18:56.229 --> 01:18:56.239 align:start position:0%
collaborative lawyer
 
01:18:58.470 --> 01:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
as long as they follow the process
 
01:19:02.950 --> 01:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
i believe so
 
01:19:08.229 --> 01:19:08.239 align:start position:0%
i again um as the attorney on the other
 
01:19:10.630 --> 01:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
side i would probably choose not to work
 
01:19:12.229 --> 01:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
with that attorney and tell my client
 
01:19:15.030 --> 01:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
that if that's who who their their
 
01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
significant other is going to have i had
 
01:19:17.830 --> 01:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
some concerns because they weren't
 
01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
collaboratively trained or i might want
 
01:19:21.430 --> 01:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
to talk with that attorney before
 
01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
deciding i would i would move ahead with
 
01:19:25.189 --> 01:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
the case with that attorney and try to
 
01:19:26.709 --> 01:19:26.719 align:start position:0%
get a better idea of what's their
 
01:19:28.950 --> 01:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
background as far as mediation dispute
 
01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
resolution and things of that nature
 
01:19:33.990 --> 01:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
you know there are some attorneys who
 
01:19:36.390 --> 01:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
are very litigious and i think taking a
 
01:19:37.990 --> 01:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
very litigious attorney into the
 
01:19:39.910 --> 01:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
collaborative law association law
 
01:19:41.669 --> 01:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
process would pretty much
 
01:19:43.189 --> 01:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
definitely uh
 
01:19:44.950 --> 01:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
make it a short process for that case
 
01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
and i wouldn't be serving my client in
 
01:19:47.830 --> 01:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
those instances
 
01:19:49.590 --> 01:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
but there's nothing fundamentally that
 
01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
i'm aware of and that's just me
 
01:19:52.870 --> 01:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
individually that would prevent someone
 
01:19:54.630 --> 01:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
from saying yes i want to i want to do
 
01:19:57.350 --> 01:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
collaborative work
 
01:19:59.030 --> 01:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
and i guess the other ques collaborative
 
01:20:02.709 --> 01:20:02.719 align:start position:0%
law has been around for a long time
 
01:20:05.189 --> 01:20:05.199 align:start position:0%
is this the first time that this
 
01:20:06.550 --> 01:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
type of
 
01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
formality has been proposed you know
 
01:20:11.990 --> 01:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
it was part of an omnibus bill last year
 
01:20:13.830 --> 01:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
that got vetoed for i think other
 
01:20:16.830 --> 01:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
reasons um it was it's been it's been
 
01:20:19.110 --> 01:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
non-controversial in both in both
 
01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
hearings that we had last year on it
 
01:20:24.070 --> 01:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
um i said it's it's bipartisan it's
 
01:20:26.629 --> 01:20:26.639 align:start position:0%
voluntary on the who can participate by
 
01:20:28.550 --> 01:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
the way i would add that the same goes
 
01:20:31.270 --> 01:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
for mediators i could tomorrow hang out
 
01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
my shingle and say hey i'm going to
 
01:20:34.709 --> 01:20:34.719 align:start position:0%
start mediating cases
 
01:20:36.709 --> 01:20:36.719 align:start position:0%
um and then people get to decide if they
 
01:20:38.790 --> 01:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
think i'm i'm worth coming to mediate
 
01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
cases with
 
01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.350 align:start position:0%
cases with
um

01:20:41.350 --> 01:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:42.070 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:20:44.550 --> 01:20:44.560 align:start position:0%
that that that part isn't necessarily
 
01:20:47.030 --> 01:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
unique to this bill but yes this is it
 
01:20:49.189 --> 01:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
it was it was part of an omnibus which
 
01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
became i believe the issue last time
 
01:20:53.590 --> 01:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
um for not not reasons associated with
 
01:20:55.110 --> 01:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:20:56.149 --> 01:20:56.159 align:start position:0%

01:22:00.149 --> 01:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
record i'm the executive director of the
 
01:22:01.669 --> 01:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
national association of settlement
 
01:22:01.679 --> 01:22:03.030 align:start position:0%
national association of settlement
purchasers

01:22:03.030 --> 01:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
purchasers
 
01:22:05.110 --> 01:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
here to speak in support of part five of
 
01:22:06.550 --> 01:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:22:08.149 --> 01:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
relating to
 
01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
creating a new hampshire structured
 
01:22:12.709 --> 01:22:12.719 align:start position:0%
settlement protection act
 
01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
what this part of the bill would do
 
01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:16.790 align:start position:0%
what this part of the bill would do
would

01:22:16.790 --> 01:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:22:18.870 --> 01:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
bring new hampshire into alignment with
 
01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
the other 49 states in the district of
 
01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
columbia of having
 
01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
its own structured settlement protection
 
01:22:25.199 --> 01:22:26.390 align:start position:0%
its own structured settlement protection
act

01:22:26.390 --> 01:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
act
 
01:22:28.229 --> 01:22:28.239 align:start position:0%
what this would do would to
 
01:22:30.790 --> 01:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
basically provide the framework
 
01:22:33.030 --> 01:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
for individuals in new hampshire who are
 
01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
interested in
 
01:22:37.270 --> 01:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
who are receiving structured settlement
 
01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
payments as a result of a
 
01:22:42.229 --> 01:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
a personal injury accident a wrongful
 
01:22:44.790 --> 01:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
death case or a variety of never matters
 
01:22:46.550 --> 01:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
basically provides the framework for
 
01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
those individuals in new hampshire
 
01:22:51.350 --> 01:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
to go through a
 
01:22:53.189 --> 01:22:53.199 align:start position:0%
court approval process
 
01:22:53.199 --> 01:22:54.470 align:start position:0%
court approval process
essentially

01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
01:22:56.390 --> 01:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
so that in this case a third party in
 
01:22:58.550 --> 01:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
this case a judge in new hampshire would
 
01:23:00.950 --> 01:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
review the transaction
 
01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:02.550 align:start position:0%
review the transaction
and

01:23:02.550 --> 01:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
essentially make sure that the
 
01:23:05.270 --> 01:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
transaction is going to be in the
 
01:23:07.110 --> 01:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
structured settlement recipient's best
 
01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
interest and the best interest of their
 
01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:11.189 align:start position:0%
interest and the best interest of their
dependents

01:23:11.189 --> 01:23:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:11.199 --> 01:23:11.990 align:start position:0%
 
this

01:23:11.990 --> 01:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:23:15.189 --> 01:23:15.199 align:start position:0%
section part five is based off of
 
01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
the encoil model the most recent
 
01:23:18.790 --> 01:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
variation which is what most of the
 
01:23:21.430 --> 01:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
state statutes
 
01:23:22.709 --> 01:23:22.719 align:start position:0%
that are put into place in the other
 
01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
states are based off of the encoil model
 
01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
it is a
 
01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:28.950 align:start position:0%
it is a
very

01:23:28.950 --> 01:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:31.030 --> 01:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
is a finely tuned
 
01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
statute that has been put together and
 
01:23:33.990 --> 01:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
refined over the years since its
 
01:23:36.870 --> 01:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
inception essentially to make sure that
 
01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
there are consumer protections for
 
01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
individuals in this process to make sure
 
01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:42.629 align:start position:0%
individuals in this process to make sure
that

01:23:42.629 --> 01:23:42.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:23:44.790 --> 01:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
all the parties that necessarily need to
 
01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:45.910 align:start position:0%
all the parties that necessarily need to
receive

01:23:45.910 --> 01:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
receive
 
01:23:47.910 --> 01:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
a notice of these transactions receive
 
01:23:49.430 --> 01:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
notice and just make sure that you know
 
01:23:52.790 --> 01:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire citizens uh have a
 
01:23:56.709 --> 01:23:56.719 align:start position:0%
um very thorough uh but very protective
 
01:23:57.910 --> 01:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
process when they're in these
 
01:23:57.920 --> 01:23:59.350 align:start position:0%
process when they're in these
transactions

01:23:59.350 --> 01:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
transactions
 
01:24:02.790 --> 01:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:05.750 --> 01:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
this part 5 will do is essentially make
 
01:24:07.510 --> 01:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
sure that all new hampshire citizens
 
01:24:10.390 --> 01:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
have a uniformed law that
 
01:24:12.550 --> 01:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
governs these transactions
 
01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:13.990 align:start position:0%
governs these transactions
currently

01:24:13.990 --> 01:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:24:16.229 --> 01:24:16.239 align:start position:0%
since new hampshire does not have a
 
01:24:18.229 --> 01:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
structured settlement protection act if
 
01:24:20.629 --> 01:24:20.639 align:start position:0%
a new hampshire citizen wishes to
 
01:24:22.550 --> 01:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
proceed with one of these transactions
 
01:24:24.709 --> 01:24:24.719 align:start position:0%
they actually have to import the law of
 
01:24:26.229 --> 01:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
a different state
 
01:24:28.310 --> 01:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
so that a
 
01:24:31.030 --> 01:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
a new hampshire citizen had a
 
01:24:32.550 --> 01:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
transaction where an insurance company
 
01:24:35.669 --> 01:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
was based in texas or california
 
01:24:37.910 --> 01:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh or delaware or wherever that
 
01:24:40.229 --> 01:24:40.239 align:start position:0%
insurance company may be to move forward
 
01:24:41.430 --> 01:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
with one of these transactions they
 
01:24:43.910 --> 01:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
currently have to import the law of that
 
01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:45.270 align:start position:0%
currently have to import the law of that
state

01:24:45.270 --> 01:24:45.280 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:24:47.830 --> 01:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
and some of the state laws vary wildly
 
01:24:49.990 --> 01:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
so that new hampshire citizens you know
 
01:24:52.790 --> 01:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
currently would have to go through
 
01:24:54.310 --> 01:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
whatever that particular state's
 
01:24:56.709 --> 01:24:56.719 align:start position:0%
requirements uh the passage of this
 
01:24:58.870 --> 01:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
portion of the omnibus bill would make
 
01:25:00.870 --> 01:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
sure that new hampshire has its own
 
01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:01.669 align:start position:0%
sure that new hampshire has its own
law

01:25:01.669 --> 01:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:25:01.679 --> 01:25:02.470 align:start position:0%
law
uh

01:25:02.470 --> 01:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:25:04.709 --> 01:25:04.719 align:start position:0%
with all of the up-to-date current
 
01:25:06.390 --> 01:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
protections that the encoil model
 
01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:07.510 align:start position:0%
protections that the encoil model
affords

01:25:07.510 --> 01:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
affords
 
01:25:09.270 --> 01:25:09.280 align:start position:0%
to make sure that all new hampshire
 
01:25:11.430 --> 01:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
citizens are treated
 
01:25:14.310 --> 01:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
you know similarly and have the same
 
01:25:15.830 --> 01:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
similar consumer protections that this
 
01:25:17.189 --> 01:25:17.199 align:start position:0%
bill would provide
 
01:25:19.590 --> 01:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh there was uh some input that we
 
01:25:22.310 --> 01:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
received uh from the judiciary uh i
 
01:25:24.229 --> 01:25:24.239 align:start position:0%
believe the amendment uh that
 
01:25:26.790 --> 01:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
representative burch uh referenced
 
01:25:30.149 --> 01:25:30.159 align:start position:0%
earlier on in this committee hearing uh
 
01:25:32.390 --> 01:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
the amendment essentially addresses the
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
concerns he judiciary brought up
 
01:25:36.390 --> 01:25:36.400 align:start position:0%
essentially one of the things in one of
 
01:25:38.470 --> 01:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
the disclosures that
 
01:25:40.149 --> 01:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
each new hampshire citizen who wants to
 
01:25:42.229 --> 01:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
enter into one of these transactions
 
01:25:44.310 --> 01:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
uh we're adding an additional disclosure
 
01:25:46.149 --> 01:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
in that amendment essentially making
 
01:25:48.790 --> 01:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
sure that new hampshire citizens uh you
 
01:25:51.270 --> 01:25:51.280 align:start position:0%
know understand that they have the right
 
01:25:53.189 --> 01:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
essentially to receive multiple offers
 
01:25:55.030 --> 01:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
from different companies to make sure
 
01:25:56.149 --> 01:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
that when they're going through this
 
01:25:58.870 --> 01:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
process um that they consider if they
 
01:26:00.550 --> 01:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to do so to shop around and make
 
01:26:02.310 --> 01:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
sure they're getting the best
 
01:26:03.750 --> 01:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
price possible for the payments they're
 
01:26:05.430 --> 01:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
wishing to sell
 
01:26:06.950 --> 01:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
and it's also making sure that the
 
01:26:09.189 --> 01:26:09.199 align:start position:0%
judiciary takes in back consideration to
 
01:26:11.030 --> 01:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
make sure when they're deciding whether
 
01:26:12.790 --> 01:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
or not uh this transaction is going to
 
01:26:15.110 --> 01:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
be in a best interest that they have had
 
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to shop around again if
 
01:26:19.110 --> 01:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
the citizen wishes to do so
 
01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh there will be a number of other uh
 
01:26:22.629 --> 01:26:22.639 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:26:24.149 --> 01:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
stakeholders who will be testifying
 
01:26:26.149 --> 01:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
later today my colleague jack kelly will
 
01:26:27.430 --> 01:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
be telling you a little bit more about
 
01:26:29.830 --> 01:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
the history uh in addition to being the
 
01:26:31.030 --> 01:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
executive director of the trade
 
01:26:32.950 --> 01:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
association i am also a practicing
 
01:26:34.709 --> 01:26:34.719 align:start position:0%
attorney in this space
 
01:26:36.149 --> 01:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
in the state of texas so i'm very
 
01:26:38.070 --> 01:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
familiar with the mechanics on how these
 
01:26:40.390 --> 01:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
cases operate so that if any members of
 
01:26:41.750 --> 01:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
the committee have any specific
 
01:26:44.229 --> 01:26:44.239 align:start position:0%
questions as far as the mechanics of how
 
01:26:46.470 --> 01:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
this statute would work i can certainly
 
01:26:48.070 --> 01:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
address those questions and i'm happy to
 
01:26:50.390 --> 01:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
take any questions that the committee
 
01:26:52.149 --> 01:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
has but we are certainly in support of
 
01:26:54.070 --> 01:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
this bill and we hope that the
 
01:26:56.790 --> 01:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
committee would uh act favorably upon
 
01:26:59.430 --> 01:26:59.440 align:start position:0%
part five of this bill
 
01:27:00.709 --> 01:27:00.719 align:start position:0%
are there any
 
01:27:05.910 --> 01:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:07.669 --> 01:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
see none thank you for your testimony
 
01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
today thank you very much ladies and
 
01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:12.470 align:start position:0%
today thank you very much ladies and
gentlemen

01:27:12.470 --> 01:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:24.310 --> 01:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman gordon and members
 
01:27:26.629 --> 01:27:26.639 align:start position:0%
of the committee um thank you for this
 
01:27:28.390 --> 01:27:28.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak in support of
 
01:27:30.390 --> 01:27:30.400 align:start position:0%
section 10 of the bill relative to

employer access to motor vehicle records
 
01:27:35.430 --> 01:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
as it was amended and came out of the

my name is john diana and i'm the
 
01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
general counsel and chief compliance
 
01:27:43.830 --> 01:27:43.840 align:start position:0%

01:27:45.270 --> 01:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
my company
 
01:27:48.470 --> 01:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
serves over 100 000 employers in the us
 
01:27:51.030 --> 01:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
and canada and our singular mission is
 
01:27:52.870 --> 01:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
to help employers
 
01:27:56.790 --> 01:27:56.800 align:start position:0%
improve driver safety and road safety
 
01:27:56.800 --> 01:27:58.149 align:start position:0%
improve driver safety and road safety
and

01:27:58.149 --> 01:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:28:01.110 --> 01:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle records are the most
 
01:28:04.709 --> 01:28:04.719 align:start position:0%
important part of a any employer safety
 
01:28:04.719 --> 01:28:06.790 align:start position:0%
important part of a any employer safety
policy

01:28:06.790 --> 01:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
policy
 
01:28:09.430 --> 01:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
um just to clarify a motor vehicle
 
01:28:12.310 --> 01:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
record provides two pieces of critical
 
01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
information for anybody who employs
 
01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:15.750 align:start position:0%
information for anybody who employs
drivers

01:28:15.750 --> 01:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
drivers
 
01:28:18.229 --> 01:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
one is whether they have a valid license
 
01:28:19.430 --> 01:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
at any time
 
01:28:21.669 --> 01:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
so does is that person properly licensed
 
01:28:22.870 --> 01:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
to drive
 
01:28:25.669 --> 01:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
secondly it provides their
 
01:28:28.229 --> 01:28:28.239 align:start position:0%
record of violations
 
01:28:32.149 --> 01:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
dui speeding running a red light etc
 
01:28:34.149 --> 01:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
it's important to clarify there is no
 
01:28:36.070 --> 01:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
alternative to a motor vehicle record
 
01:28:38.149 --> 01:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
for employer so the only opportunity for
 
01:28:39.830 --> 01:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
an employer to make sure that they have
 
01:28:42.390 --> 01:28:42.400 align:start position:0%
qualified drivers that are not a risk to
 
01:28:44.390 --> 01:28:44.400 align:start position:0%
the public behind the wheel is to
 
01:28:46.629 --> 01:28:46.639 align:start position:0%
acquire a motor vehicle record
 
01:28:48.550 --> 01:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
and i just want to share some critical
 
01:28:50.709 --> 01:28:50.719 align:start position:0%
stats to emphasize how important these
 
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
records are
 
01:28:54.790 --> 01:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
94 of accidents are the result of human
 
01:28:57.350 --> 01:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
behavior five percent of accidents
 
01:28:59.830 --> 01:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
involve a driver with an invalid
 
01:29:01.590 --> 01:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
driver's license
 
01:29:04.550 --> 01:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
19 of fatalities involve a driver
 
01:29:06.950 --> 01:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
without a valid driver's license
 
01:29:09.270 --> 01:29:09.280 align:start position:0%
26 percent of fatalities involve
 
01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:10.790 align:start position:0%
26 percent of fatalities involve
speeding

01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
speeding
 
01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
and alcohol is a contributing factor in
 
01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:15.030 align:start position:0%
and alcohol is a contributing factor in
39

01:29:15.030 --> 01:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
39
 
01:29:18.310 --> 01:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:20.629 --> 01:29:20.639 align:start position:0%
the reason uh for this bill
 
01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
it for section 10 is that the dmv
 
01:29:26.709 --> 01:29:26.719 align:start position:0%
currently interprets new hampshire law
 
01:29:26.719 --> 01:29:28.870 align:start position:0%
currently interprets new hampshire law
to

01:29:28.870 --> 01:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:30.310 align:start position:0%
to
require

01:29:30.310 --> 01:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
require
 
01:29:33.189 --> 01:29:33.199 align:start position:0%
an employer to have a notarized form on
 
01:29:35.590 --> 01:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
an individualized basis
 
01:29:38.550 --> 01:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
filed with the dmv in order to acquire a
 
01:29:41.030 --> 01:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
record on a employee
 
01:29:43.030 --> 01:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is the only state with
 
01:29:44.790 --> 01:29:44.800 align:start position:0%
this restriction
 
01:29:47.590 --> 01:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
and it is impractical costly and time
 
01:29:50.310 --> 01:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
consuming for employers
 
01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
it makes it substantially more likely
 
01:29:54.709 --> 01:29:54.719 align:start position:0%
that an employer will not pull a motor
 
01:29:56.629 --> 01:29:56.639 align:start position:0%
vehicle record and will put a driver
 
01:29:59.110 --> 01:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
behind the wheel that is a danger to the
 
01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:00.390 align:start position:0%
behind the wheel that is a danger to the
public

01:30:00.390 --> 01:30:00.400 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:01.510 align:start position:0%
public
um

01:30:01.510 --> 01:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:04.709 --> 01:30:04.719 align:start position:0%
we've uh my company has
 
01:30:06.870 --> 01:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
engaged with the dmv
 
01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:07.830 align:start position:0%
engaged with the dmv
for

01:30:07.830 --> 01:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:30:09.910 --> 01:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
well over a year on this issue and the
 
01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
dmv encouraged collaboration with the
 
01:30:15.990 --> 01:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:18.070 --> 01:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
so section 10 does a few really
 
01:30:20.310 --> 01:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
important things it permits electronic
 
01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
access for employers and their agents
 
01:30:25.350 --> 01:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
it will benefit employers contributing
 
01:30:27.189 --> 01:30:27.199 align:start position:0%
to improve road safety and ultimately
 
01:30:29.830 --> 01:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
help reduce accidents in new hampshire
 
01:30:31.910 --> 01:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
and it will maintain federal and state
 
01:30:33.750 --> 01:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
protections for individuals
 
01:30:36.790 --> 01:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
most importantly no employer can pull
 
01:30:40.070 --> 01:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
the dmv record of an employee without a
 
01:30:42.229 --> 01:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
written consent from that employee so
 
01:30:43.669 --> 01:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
they have to provide them notice in
 
01:30:45.510 --> 01:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
advance and receive written
 
01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:48.400 align:start position:0%
authorization to pull that record um
 
01:30:50.070 --> 01:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
that's all and thank you very much for
 
01:30:53.350 --> 01:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:55.910 --> 01:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative oregon do you
 
01:30:57.430 --> 01:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
01:30:59.110 --> 01:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
uh sure i don't know if it's the right
 
01:31:01.990 --> 01:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
place to address it but i
 
01:31:04.310 --> 01:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
the commercial driver's license
 
01:31:06.870 --> 01:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
isn't mentioned specifically in part 10
 
01:31:09.270 --> 01:31:09.280 align:start position:0%
from my understanding is and
 
01:31:10.550 --> 01:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:31:13.110 --> 01:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
you may i may i may be misinterpreting
 
01:31:15.350 --> 01:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
what i thought i read but the commercial
 
01:31:17.350 --> 01:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
drivers licenses um
 
01:31:19.110 --> 01:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
they routinely
 
01:31:21.590 --> 01:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh check the uh motor v
 
01:31:23.510 --> 01:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
your record more stringently than they
 
01:31:25.750 --> 01:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
do for somebody who's a regular driver's
 
01:31:28.149 --> 01:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
license and part of the reason why this
 
01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:30.400 align:start position:0%
bill supposedly is necessary
 
01:31:32.470 --> 01:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
i think from what i've seen is that
 
01:31:34.470 --> 01:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh people are more people are being
 
01:31:37.110 --> 01:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
hired as drivers for hire who aren't uh
 
01:31:39.030 --> 01:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
they're driving vehicles that require a
 
01:31:41.030 --> 01:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
commercial driver's license or also
 
01:31:42.709 --> 01:31:42.719 align:start position:0%
there's also don't
 
01:31:44.709 --> 01:31:44.719 align:start position:0%
have to go to the restrictions for uh
 
01:31:44.719 --> 01:31:45.750 align:start position:0%
have to go to the restrictions for uh
for

01:31:45.750 --> 01:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:31:47.350 --> 01:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
transporting students or for being a
 
01:31:50.790 --> 01:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
taxi driver so would uh
 
01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
what would another solution maybe be to
 
01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:54.550 align:start position:0%
what would another solution maybe be to
expand

01:31:54.550 --> 01:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
expand
 
01:31:55.750 --> 01:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh who
 
01:31:57.350 --> 01:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
who needs a commercial driver's license
 
01:32:01.030 --> 01:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
to be employed as a be hired as a driver
 
01:32:03.110 --> 01:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
thanks not sure but hopefully i made
 
01:32:05.910 --> 01:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
myself reasonably clear no thank you uh
 
01:32:08.229 --> 01:32:08.239 align:start position:0%
and i fully understand the question and
 
01:32:09.189 --> 01:32:09.199 align:start position:0%
i will
 
01:32:10.870 --> 01:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
agree with you you're absolutely right
 
01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:11.669 align:start position:0%
agree with you you're absolutely right
that

01:32:11.669 --> 01:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
01:32:14.790 --> 01:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
there's a population of drivers that are
 
01:32:16.709 --> 01:32:16.719 align:start position:0%
currently unregulated that are growing
 
01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
very fast in the state and for example
 
01:32:21.990 --> 01:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
are drivers for like doordash instacart
 
01:32:23.350 --> 01:32:23.360 align:start position:0%
if you're driving full-time for a
 
01:32:24.870 --> 01:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
company like that you may drive in
 
01:32:27.350 --> 01:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
excess of a hundred thousand miles
 
01:32:28.629 --> 01:32:28.639 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:32:30.870 --> 01:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
unlike a driver of a tractor trailer
 
01:32:32.950 --> 01:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
you're not specifically trained for
 
01:32:34.629 --> 01:32:34.639 align:start position:0%
commercial driving so it's even more
 
01:32:35.990 --> 01:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
important to have access to a motor
 
01:32:37.910 --> 01:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
vehicle record
 
01:32:39.590 --> 01:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
regarding the question about commercial
 
01:32:42.229 --> 01:32:42.239 align:start position:0%
licenses those are generally determined
 
01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
by federal law so the
 
01:32:46.550 --> 01:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
department of transportation
 
01:32:49.590 --> 01:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
provides requirements for what is a
 
01:32:51.910 --> 01:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
commercial driver's license and the
 
01:32:54.470 --> 01:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
endorsements required in training and
 
01:32:57.030 --> 01:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
other requirements i think it would be a
 
01:32:57.040 --> 01:32:58.070 align:start position:0%
other requirements i think it would be a
challenge

01:32:58.070 --> 01:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
challenge
 
01:33:00.870 --> 01:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
to try to pull all commercial drivers
 
01:33:03.110 --> 01:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
under a commercial license because the
 
01:33:04.870 --> 01:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
requirements are so
 
01:33:06.950 --> 01:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
individual whether they
 
01:33:10.629 --> 01:33:10.639 align:start position:0%
transport hazmat materials etc so i
 
01:33:13.030 --> 01:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
think this is a this bill is a very
 
01:33:14.629 --> 01:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
flexible way to
 
01:33:16.709 --> 01:33:16.719 align:start position:0%
ensure employers can qualify their
 
01:33:16.719 --> 01:33:17.910 align:start position:0%
ensure employers can qualify their
drivers

01:33:17.910 --> 01:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
drivers
 
01:33:19.590 --> 01:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
okay yeah thanks and in the interest of
 
01:33:21.270 --> 01:33:21.280 align:start position:0%
full disclosure i actually currently
 
01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
hold a cdlb license myself even though i
 
01:33:26.470 --> 01:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
haven't driven anything larger than a
 
01:33:28.709 --> 01:33:28.719 align:start position:0%
volvo in about 15 years
 
01:33:30.070 --> 01:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
partially it's just a matter of pride
 
01:33:31.430 --> 01:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
i've spent a lot of effort learning to
 
01:33:42.629 --> 01:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:45.030 --> 01:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you mr dan for
 
01:33:47.430 --> 01:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question just so i'm clear on
 
01:33:49.590 --> 01:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
this would these be records that could
 
01:33:52.229 --> 01:33:52.239 align:start position:0%
be pulled from across the country or is
 
01:33:55.430 --> 01:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
it just specifically your driver record
 
01:33:57.510 --> 01:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
01:33:59.189 --> 01:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
it's just your driving record in new
 
01:34:00.709 --> 01:34:00.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire so
 
01:34:02.709 --> 01:34:02.719 align:start position:0%
each state dmv
 
01:34:05.430 --> 01:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
maintains the record on their licensed
 
01:34:07.110 --> 01:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
drivers in their state
 
01:34:08.149 --> 01:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
so this
 
01:34:10.470 --> 01:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
this record would only provide the
 
01:34:14.390 --> 01:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
driving record in new hampshire although
 
01:34:16.950 --> 01:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
through reciprocity if i have a license
 
01:34:19.110 --> 01:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and i have a serious
 
01:34:21.189 --> 01:34:21.199 align:start position:0%
infraction in massachusetts
 
01:34:23.350 --> 01:34:23.360 align:start position:0%
uh the only way to be aware of that is
 
01:34:24.950 --> 01:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
that massachusetts would share that
 
01:34:27.669 --> 01:34:27.679 align:start position:0%
information with the new hampshire dmv
 
01:34:30.550 --> 01:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
and it would appear on my driving record
 
01:34:33.510 --> 01:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you that was exactly where
 
01:34:34.950 --> 01:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
the thanks
 
01:34:37.990 --> 01:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:39.270 --> 01:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
01:34:41.830 --> 01:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh you earlier uh
 
01:34:45.189 --> 01:34:45.199 align:start position:0%
stated some uh statistics
 
01:34:47.189 --> 01:34:47.199 align:start position:0%
did those apply to
 
01:34:51.030 --> 01:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
drivers in general or commercial drivers
 
01:34:53.350 --> 01:34:53.360 align:start position:0%
oh those are those apply to drivers in
 
01:34:55.109 --> 01:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
general so that's the
 
01:34:57.669 --> 01:34:57.679 align:start position:0%
us population of drivers
 
01:35:00.870 --> 01:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
and uh follow-up mr chairman yes you may
 
01:35:02.310 --> 01:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:35:05.350 --> 01:35:05.360 align:start position:0%
so i'm trying to
 
01:35:07.669 --> 01:35:07.679 align:start position:0%
figure how this is going to work is
 
01:35:09.350 --> 01:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
there going to be
 
01:35:11.350 --> 01:35:11.360 align:start position:0%
a number of companies holding all of
 
01:35:13.590 --> 01:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
this data or is this going to be
 
01:35:17.590 --> 01:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
centralized in one particular place
 
01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:18.550 align:start position:0%
centralized in one particular place
yeah

01:35:18.550 --> 01:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:35:20.310 --> 01:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for that and i can speak to
 
01:35:23.109 --> 01:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
that because um we assist employers in
 
01:35:24.550 --> 01:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
other states
 
01:35:26.830 --> 01:35:26.840 align:start position:0%
so generally it's up to the state to
 
01:35:29.510 --> 01:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
determine an appropriate contractual
 
01:35:31.910 --> 01:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
term for the employer or an agent
 
01:35:33.510 --> 01:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
acquiring the record on behalf of the
 
01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:34.550 align:start position:0%
acquiring the record on behalf of the
employer

01:35:34.550 --> 01:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
employer
 
01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:35.510 align:start position:0%
employer
um

01:35:35.510 --> 01:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:37.510 --> 01:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
so you know that's
 
01:35:39.109 --> 01:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
my experience it's always a written
 
01:35:41.270 --> 01:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
contract it requires compliance it
 
01:35:44.550 --> 01:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
covers things like retention of records
 
01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
restrictions on use
 
01:35:49.750 --> 01:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
i would also point out that federal law
 
01:35:51.669 --> 01:35:51.679 align:start position:0%
the driver's privacy protection act and
 
01:35:54.149 --> 01:35:54.159 align:start position:0%
the fair credit reporting act
 
01:35:56.629 --> 01:35:56.639 align:start position:0%
limit use of a record like a driving
 
01:35:57.990 --> 01:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
record to
 
01:36:00.790 --> 01:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
the singular use of screening an
 
01:36:02.709 --> 01:36:02.719 align:start position:0%
employer for qualification
 
01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
so the law already prohibits use of that
 
01:36:08.709 --> 01:36:08.719 align:start position:0%
information for marketing for any other
 
01:36:11.510 --> 01:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
purpose other than the express
 
01:36:16.149 --> 01:36:16.159 align:start position:0%
requirement to screen a eligible driver
 
01:36:18.870 --> 01:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:20.070 --> 01:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
representative horgan did you have
 
01:36:22.629 --> 01:36:22.639 align:start position:0%
another question
 
01:36:25.669 --> 01:36:25.679 align:start position:0%
i just forgot to lower my hand
 
01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll lower it now thank you thank
 
01:36:30.070 --> 01:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
you representative mclean thank you mr
 
01:36:31.590 --> 01:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
so with the exception of going from
 
01:36:39.430 --> 01:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:41.669 --> 01:36:41.679 align:start position:0%
the electronic delivery
 
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
is that the only change so here we have
 
01:36:48.149 --> 01:36:48.159 align:start position:0%
uh the direct the consent is retained
 
01:36:50.629 --> 01:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
for a three year period and it goes
 
01:36:51.669 --> 01:36:51.679 align:start position:0%
through the
 
01:36:53.669 --> 01:36:53.679 align:start position:0%
type of information that would be
 
01:36:53.679 --> 01:36:54.790 align:start position:0%
type of information that would be
gathered

01:36:54.790 --> 01:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
gathered
 
01:36:57.030 --> 01:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
so all of those things
 
01:37:00.709 --> 01:37:00.719 align:start position:0%
are in line with the the prior statute
 
01:37:02.390 --> 01:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
the only thing you're saying like the
 
01:37:04.470 --> 01:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
three years is the same the amount of
 
01:37:06.390 --> 01:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
information is all the same it's just
 
01:37:09.510 --> 01:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
the mode of delivery that's different
 
01:37:13.189 --> 01:37:13.199 align:start position:0%
yes uh agree out with one proviso
 
01:37:13.199 --> 01:37:13.990 align:start position:0%
yes uh agree out with one proviso
um

01:37:13.990 --> 01:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:16.550 --> 01:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
there is a portion of section 10
 
01:37:19.109 --> 01:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
that further permits the state to
 
01:37:21.910 --> 01:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
provide ongoing um
 
01:37:24.870 --> 01:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh updates to records to an employer so
 
01:37:27.030 --> 01:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
if i hire somebody today
 
01:37:30.070 --> 01:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
and they receive a dui or their license
 
01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
is suspended in a month
 
01:37:35.030 --> 01:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
it would enable the department to
 
01:37:37.350 --> 01:37:37.360 align:start position:0%
provide some sort of update file that
 
01:37:39.830 --> 01:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
would say hey this record has changed
 
01:37:42.149 --> 01:37:42.159 align:start position:0%
and uh you as an employer should be
 
01:37:43.430 --> 01:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
aware of that
 
01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:44.310 align:start position:0%
aware of that
but

01:37:44.310 --> 01:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:37:46.629 --> 01:37:46.639 align:start position:0%
yes to answer your question directly
 
01:37:48.229 --> 01:37:48.239 align:start position:0%
these are already public records
 
01:37:50.229 --> 01:37:50.239 align:start position:0%
employers can access them it's just very
 
01:37:53.350 --> 01:37:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:54.950 --> 01:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:37:59.430 --> 01:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:01.990 --> 01:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
mr diane thank you for your testimony
 
01:38:03.189 --> 01:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
representative chase did you have a
 
01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
question yes i'm so sorry thank you i'm
 
01:38:07.430 --> 01:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
just curious how long does it take to
 
01:38:09.510 --> 01:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
get these records so that when you're
 
01:38:11.669 --> 01:38:11.679 align:start position:0%
hiring somebody what's your wait time
 
01:38:13.590 --> 01:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
before they can start
 
01:38:15.510 --> 01:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
yeah that's uh thank you for asking that
 
01:38:17.669 --> 01:38:17.679 align:start position:0%
because one of the key benefits to
 
01:38:19.590 --> 01:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
employers in addition to improving
 
01:38:21.430 --> 01:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
safety of their drivers
 
01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
and avoiding the
 
01:38:24.870 --> 01:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
legal risk of an accident with an
 
01:38:27.510 --> 01:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
unqualified driver is the wait time
 
01:38:30.070 --> 01:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
right so electronic access would allow
 
01:38:34.070 --> 01:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
an employer to screen same time same day
 
01:38:36.390 --> 01:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
pull a record automatically read that
 
01:38:38.470 --> 01:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
record and make a hiring decision on the
 
01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:39.669 align:start position:0%
record and make a hiring decision on the
spot

01:38:39.669 --> 01:38:39.679 align:start position:0%
spot
 
01:38:42.470 --> 01:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
having to file a notarized release go
 
01:38:44.229 --> 01:38:44.239 align:start position:0%
down to the dmv and get a copy of a
 
01:38:47.590 --> 01:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
record could take days or weeks
 
01:38:49.350 --> 01:38:49.360 align:start position:0%
perfect thank you
 
01:38:52.950 --> 01:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
any other questions for mr diana
 
01:38:54.229 --> 01:38:54.239 align:start position:0%

01:50:39.990 --> 01:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
been doing with this statute
 
01:50:41.990 --> 01:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
specifically ensuring that how the
 
01:50:43.669 --> 01:50:43.679 align:start position:0%
language does provide is a strict
 
01:50:45.589 --> 01:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
liability statute
 
01:50:47.750 --> 01:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
while at the same time clarifying that
 
01:50:49.830 --> 01:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
the damages that are included in this
 
01:50:52.470 --> 01:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
statute are not just damages to the
 
01:50:56.149 --> 01:50:56.159 align:start position:0%
highway itself as in tarmac but also any
 
01:50:58.470 --> 01:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
uh guardrails signage
 
01:51:00.629 --> 01:51:00.639 align:start position:0%
uh any other materials that the state or
 
01:51:02.390 --> 01:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
municipality would own
 
01:51:04.390 --> 01:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
that are involved with the highway
 
01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:06.070 align:start position:0%
that are involved with the highway
itself

01:51:06.070 --> 01:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
itself
 
01:51:07.990 --> 01:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh earlier it was mentioned that there
 
01:51:09.830 --> 01:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
was a proposed amendment uh that
 
01:51:12.550 --> 01:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
amendment would be the addition of some
 
01:51:14.390 --> 01:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
language that would ensure that this
 
01:51:16.950 --> 01:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
statute would apply both to
 
01:51:16.960 --> 01:51:18.149 align:start position:0%
statute would apply both to
forthcoming

01:51:18.149 --> 01:51:18.159 align:start position:0%
forthcoming
 
01:51:20.470 --> 01:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
accidents that we need to collect on but
 
01:51:21.750 --> 01:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
also a
 
01:51:23.910 --> 01:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
series of accidents that have occurred
 
01:51:25.990 --> 01:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
in the past few years well within its
 
01:51:27.750 --> 01:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
depth limitations
 
01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh just to ensure that we can still
 
01:51:33.109 --> 01:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
collect on those accidents
 
01:51:35.990 --> 01:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh specifically
 
01:51:38.070 --> 01:51:38.080 align:start position:0%
we're looking to ensure that we could
 
01:51:40.229 --> 01:51:40.239 align:start position:0%
move forward on all of these accidents
 
01:51:42.310 --> 01:51:42.320 align:start position:0%
based on estimates of the damages that
 
01:51:43.990 --> 01:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
have occurred
 
01:51:46.229 --> 01:51:46.239 align:start position:0%
instead of just on the actual defined
 
01:51:46.239 --> 01:51:47.350 align:start position:0%
instead of just on the actual defined
damages

01:51:47.350 --> 01:51:47.360 align:start position:0%
damages
 
01:51:49.350 --> 01:51:49.360 align:start position:0%
d.o.t can give better details on their
 
01:51:51.510 --> 01:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
actual process than i can but
 
01:51:54.070 --> 01:51:54.080 align:start position:0%
whenever we do pursue litigation we are
 
01:51:54.080 --> 01:51:55.750 align:start position:0%
whenever we do pursue litigation we are
seeking

01:51:55.750 --> 01:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
seeking
 
01:51:58.629 --> 01:51:58.639 align:start position:0%
as precise damages as we can uh dot
 
01:52:00.310 --> 01:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
though because they do purchase items in
 
01:52:02.470 --> 01:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
both because they do take time to
 
01:52:04.550 --> 01:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
correct things and to actually fix some
 
01:52:06.550 --> 01:52:06.560 align:start position:0%
of the damages that occur uh it can take
 
01:52:07.990 --> 01:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
quite a while for them to determine what
 
01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
the actual damages are and oftentimes
 
01:52:13.030 --> 01:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
when everything is done in mass it can
 
01:52:14.870 --> 01:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
be very difficult to determine
 
01:52:16.470 --> 01:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
what were the damages for this specific
 
01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:18.070 align:start position:0%
what were the damages for this specific
collision

01:52:18.070 --> 01:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
collision
 
01:52:19.910 --> 01:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
when they repaired several collisions
 
01:52:22.149 --> 01:52:22.159 align:start position:0%
that all happened within that month
 
01:52:25.189 --> 01:52:25.199 align:start position:0%
allowing my office to pursue
 
01:52:27.430 --> 01:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
the reasonable estimates which dod has
 
01:52:29.189 --> 01:52:29.199 align:start position:0%
an entire process for calculating that
 
01:52:31.270 --> 01:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
is the typical manner of
 
01:52:34.229 --> 01:52:34.239 align:start position:0%
issuing invoices do cause damages uh
 
01:52:35.910 --> 01:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
would allow the process to be much more
 
01:52:37.830 --> 01:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
streamlined and allow us to actually act
 
01:52:40.070 --> 01:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
within the statute of limitations
 
01:52:42.390 --> 01:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
with a number that does reasonably
 
01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
compensate d.o.t for the damages it has
 
01:52:47.270 --> 01:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
to repair
 
01:52:49.430 --> 01:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh i'm available to answer any questions
 
01:52:51.990 --> 01:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
anyone may have
 
01:52:54.229 --> 01:52:54.239 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for attorney
 
01:52:54.239 --> 01:52:56.310 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for attorney
toll

01:52:56.310 --> 01:52:56.320 align:start position:0%
toll
 
01:52:58.070 --> 01:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
representative mclean yeah thank you mr
 
01:53:00.310 --> 01:53:00.320 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you attorney told the
 
01:53:02.229 --> 01:53:02.239 align:start position:0%
the strict liability that you're
 
01:53:04.070 --> 01:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
bringing in is that in line with other
 
01:53:05.669 --> 01:53:05.679 align:start position:0%
states or
 
01:53:07.350 --> 01:53:07.360 align:start position:0%
how do other states
 
01:53:10.070 --> 01:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
handle that liability
 
01:53:11.589 --> 01:53:11.599 align:start position:0%
uh off it's on my head i couldn't speak
 
01:53:13.109 --> 01:53:13.119 align:start position:0%
to how other states handled that uh
 
01:53:15.350 --> 01:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
obviously we focus on what's occurring
 
01:53:17.589 --> 01:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire uh what i can say
 
01:53:19.270 --> 01:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
though is the original language for the
 
01:53:22.149 --> 01:53:22.159 align:start position:0%
bill said that anyone who damages any
 
01:53:24.790 --> 01:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
part of the highway shall be liable
 
01:53:26.470 --> 01:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh the courts have interpreted that here
 
01:53:29.270 --> 01:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire to be strict liability
 
01:53:31.109 --> 01:53:31.119 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment for the strict
 
01:53:32.709 --> 01:53:32.719 align:start position:0%
liability component would be merely us
 
01:53:33.990 --> 01:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
adding the word
 
01:53:36.149 --> 01:53:36.159 align:start position:0%
shall be strictly liable so that way
 
01:53:37.910 --> 01:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
it's more clear to anyone who goes to
 
01:53:39.589 --> 01:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
read the bill anyone who may have
 
01:53:41.350 --> 01:53:41.360 align:start position:0%
questions about it and just kind of save
 
01:53:43.030 --> 01:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
time in the court instead of having to
 
01:53:47.350 --> 01:53:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:49.270 --> 01:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:53:51.750 --> 01:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
yeah i had just a couple questions if i
 
01:53:51.760 --> 01:53:52.790 align:start position:0%
yeah i had just a couple questions if i
could

01:53:52.790 --> 01:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:53:54.390 --> 01:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
when i read the bill
 
01:53:57.109 --> 01:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
and this is in the current language i
 
01:53:59.030 --> 01:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
think uh of the bill
 
01:53:59.040 --> 01:53:59.750 align:start position:0%
think uh of the bill
it

01:53:59.750 --> 01:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:54:02.229 --> 01:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
it says if any person without authority
 
01:54:04.229 --> 01:54:04.239 align:start position:0%
shall place any obstruction in a highway
 
01:54:07.189 --> 01:54:07.199 align:start position:0%
or cause any defect insufficiency
 
01:54:10.310 --> 01:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
or want a repair of a highway which
 
01:54:14.870 --> 01:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
renders it unsuitable for public travel
 
01:54:17.350 --> 01:54:17.360 align:start position:0%
and the question is
 
01:54:19.270 --> 01:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
i had when i read that is
 
01:54:21.589 --> 01:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
so you damage a guard rail does that
 
01:54:23.910 --> 01:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
make the highway unsuitable for public
 
01:54:23.920 --> 01:54:26.149 align:start position:0%
make the highway unsuitable for public
travel

01:54:26.149 --> 01:54:26.159 align:start position:0%
travel
 
01:54:28.870 --> 01:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
yes i believe so sir uh those safety
 
01:54:31.030 --> 01:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
features are in place for a reason every
 
01:54:32.629 --> 01:54:32.639 align:start position:0%
time they are damaged and compromised we
 
01:54:34.310 --> 01:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
do increase the likelihood of someone
 
01:54:36.390 --> 01:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
either injuring or killing themselves
 
01:54:38.629 --> 01:54:38.639 align:start position:0%
someone else or causing further damage
 
01:54:40.550 --> 01:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
to some other component of the hybrid
 
01:54:40.560 --> 01:54:45.669 align:start position:0%
to some other component of the hybrid
system

01:54:45.669 --> 01:54:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:45.679 --> 01:54:48.229 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:54:48.229 --> 01:54:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:49.430 --> 01:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
the other
 
01:54:51.510 --> 01:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
the other question i have and apparently
 
01:54:53.830 --> 01:54:53.840 align:start position:0%
with your what you're trying to do is to
 
01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:54.550 align:start position:0%
with your what you're trying to do is to
do

01:54:54.550 --> 01:54:54.560 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:54:56.310 --> 01:54:56.320 align:start position:0%
is to apply
 
01:54:58.790 --> 01:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
this new amendment retroactively to
 
01:55:01.270 --> 01:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
existing claims as i understand it is
 
01:55:05.109 --> 01:55:05.119 align:start position:0%
that correct that is correct and
 
01:55:07.430 --> 01:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
is that a i guess the question is is it
 
01:55:10.229 --> 01:55:10.239 align:start position:0%
appropriate to change the law to now
 
01:55:12.070 --> 01:55:12.080 align:start position:0%
make people who would not otherwise be
 
01:55:14.390 --> 01:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
liable liable for something they did in
 
01:55:16.870 --> 01:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
the past
 
01:55:18.550 --> 01:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
01:55:19.830 --> 01:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
without having to go into too much
 
01:55:22.229 --> 01:55:22.239 align:start position:0%
detail for you sir uh the way the courts
 
01:55:24.390 --> 01:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
typically look at statutes as to whether
 
01:55:25.830 --> 01:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
they are going to be retrospective or
 
01:55:29.109 --> 01:55:29.119 align:start position:0%
maybe proactive uh looks to the nature
 
01:55:30.950 --> 01:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
of the amendment of the statute uh
 
01:55:33.669 --> 01:55:33.679 align:start position:0%
whether it is remedial or whether it is
 
01:55:36.470 --> 01:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
affecting some substantive rights
 
01:55:38.310 --> 01:55:38.320 align:start position:0%
after working with d.o.t on this we
 
01:55:39.430 --> 01:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
believe this would actually be a
 
01:55:39.440 --> 01:55:40.870 align:start position:0%
believe this would actually be a
remedial

01:55:40.870 --> 01:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
remedial
 
01:55:42.629 --> 01:55:42.639 align:start position:0%
correction of the statute
 
01:55:45.189 --> 01:55:45.199 align:start position:0%
no new liability is incurred
 
01:55:47.430 --> 01:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
based on changing this from reliability
 
01:55:49.430 --> 01:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
or in making this
 
01:55:51.910 --> 01:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh to apply to all the accidents that
 
01:55:53.270 --> 01:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
have been occurring over the past year
 
01:55:55.189 --> 01:55:55.199 align:start position:0%
where we haven't been collection on them
 
01:55:56.550 --> 01:55:56.560 align:start position:0%
because of
 
01:55:58.629 --> 01:55:58.639 align:start position:0%
this incongruency between
 
01:56:00.870 --> 01:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
the estimates and actual damages
 
01:56:02.790 --> 01:56:02.800 align:start position:0%
uh it's remedial because
 
01:56:04.310 --> 01:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
these individuals are still liable for
 
01:56:06.310 --> 01:56:06.320 align:start position:0%
damaging any part of the highway
 
01:56:08.950 --> 01:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh now it's just a matter of determining
 
01:56:10.390 --> 01:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
how exactly those damages are being
 
01:56:10.400 --> 01:56:12.070 align:start position:0%
how exactly those damages are being
calculated

01:56:12.070 --> 01:56:12.080 align:start position:0%
calculated
 
01:56:14.709 --> 01:56:14.719 align:start position:0%
that alteration i would contend
 
01:56:16.870 --> 01:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
falls within the remedial nature of any
 
01:56:20.229 --> 01:56:20.239 align:start position:0%
retroactive law which is legal under
 
01:56:24.149 --> 01:56:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:26.870 --> 01:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
and i i guess my final question is
 
01:56:28.390 --> 01:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
i was under the impression that this
 
01:56:31.750 --> 01:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
same language was in the budget builds
 
01:56:35.669 --> 01:56:35.679 align:start position:0%
either house bill 1 or house bill 2
 
01:56:39.270 --> 01:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
did it not pass in those bills
 
01:56:41.830 --> 01:56:41.840 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that uh d.o.t
 
01:56:44.950 --> 01:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
attempted to get that amended language
 
01:56:47.109 --> 01:56:47.119 align:start position:0%
put in uh i'm not entirely sure why it
 
01:56:49.189 --> 01:56:49.199 align:start position:0%
didn't pass through with those so that
 
01:56:50.870 --> 01:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
would have to be a question for eot
 
01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:54.470 align:start position:0%
would have to be a question for eot
directly

01:56:54.470 --> 01:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:58.870 --> 01:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:00.870 --> 01:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:57:02.390 --> 01:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
attorney child for taking my question
 
01:57:04.149 --> 01:57:04.159 align:start position:0%
and for being here with us this morning
 
01:57:08.149 --> 01:57:08.159 align:start position:0%
um i too um share um the question that
 
01:57:10.229 --> 01:57:10.239 align:start position:0%
my form my colleague rhett mclean
 
01:57:11.510 --> 01:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned about
 
01:57:13.669 --> 01:57:13.679 align:start position:0%
um what other states their policy i
 
01:57:15.589 --> 01:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
understand we have an existing policy
 
01:57:16.950 --> 01:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
but i think
 
01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:17.830 align:start position:0%
but i think
um

01:57:17.830 --> 01:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:19.750 --> 01:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
this change to strict liability or
 
01:57:22.629 --> 01:57:22.639 align:start position:0%
clarifying that certainly is significant
 
01:57:25.030 --> 01:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
um and if i could also follow up i
 
01:57:27.430 --> 01:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
wonder how many cases are you currently
 
01:57:29.589 --> 01:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
in uh negotiation or litigation with
 
01:57:31.109 --> 01:57:31.119 align:start position:0%
with this effect
 
01:57:33.270 --> 01:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
if we changed it to retroactive
 
01:57:34.550 --> 01:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:57:36.470 --> 01:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
oh of course so
 
01:57:38.629 --> 01:57:38.639 align:start position:0%
the way that the uh debt recovery unit
 
01:57:40.310 --> 01:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
works is that these matters are referred
 
01:57:42.629 --> 01:57:42.639 align:start position:0%
to my office once d.o.t has gone through
 
01:57:44.310 --> 01:57:44.320 align:start position:0%
the proper procedure trying to collect
 
01:57:46.070 --> 01:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
on it and they've been unable to for any
 
01:57:47.430 --> 01:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
number of reasons
 
01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:48.149 align:start position:0%
number of reasons
so

01:57:48.149 --> 01:57:48.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:57:49.510 --> 01:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
what i can speak to is the number of
 
01:57:51.830 --> 01:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
cases i currently have that i'm aware of
 
01:57:54.070 --> 01:57:54.080 align:start position:0%
a d.o.t can give a better detail of what
 
01:57:56.310 --> 01:57:56.320 align:start position:0%
backlog they may have that they have not
 
01:57:58.950 --> 01:57:58.960 align:start position:0%
referred to my office yet because of
 
01:58:00.390 --> 01:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
waiting to see where this build will go
 
01:58:01.589 --> 01:58:01.599 align:start position:0%
and seeing what the collection
 
01:58:03.270 --> 01:58:03.280 align:start position:0%
applications will be
 
01:58:06.229 --> 01:58:06.239 align:start position:0%
at the moment i have i believe should be
 
01:58:09.669 --> 01:58:09.679 align:start position:0%
six or seven uh dot matters which are in
 
01:58:11.750 --> 01:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
litigation but are currently being
 
01:58:13.430 --> 01:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
suspended we just haven't done anything
 
01:58:14.709 --> 01:58:14.719 align:start position:0%
with them we're just kind of waiting to
 
01:58:17.589 --> 01:58:17.599 align:start position:0%
see where exactly uh the collection
 
01:58:19.430 --> 01:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
language is going to land
 
01:58:21.910 --> 01:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
uh those matters there at the moment uh
 
01:58:23.270 --> 01:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
they're all kind of suspended just
 
01:58:25.669 --> 01:58:25.679 align:start position:0%
because the defendants aren't responding
 
01:58:27.510 --> 01:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
so we have just chosen not to report on
 
01:58:27.520 --> 01:58:29.189 align:start position:0%
so we have just chosen not to report on
defaults

01:58:29.189 --> 01:58:29.199 align:start position:0%
defaults
 
01:58:31.750 --> 01:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
and then i also have probably 20 that
 
01:58:33.189 --> 01:58:33.199 align:start position:0%
have been referred to my office they're
 
01:58:34.229 --> 01:58:34.239 align:start position:0%
all still within the statute of
 
01:58:34.239 --> 01:58:35.910 align:start position:0%
all still within the statute of
limitations

01:58:35.910 --> 01:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
limitations
 
01:58:38.390 --> 01:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
but we are once again holding off to see
 
01:58:39.589 --> 01:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
whether we would be allowed to move
 
01:58:41.510 --> 01:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
forward with the estimates or we have to
 
01:58:43.589 --> 01:58:43.599 align:start position:0%
do the actual damages
 
01:58:45.990 --> 01:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
in both cases the liability is there
 
01:58:47.430 --> 01:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
based on the evidence it's just a matter
 
01:58:49.109 --> 01:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
of determining whether we can use the
 
01:58:51.669 --> 01:58:51.679 align:start position:0%
estimates that have been calculated and
 
01:58:53.589 --> 01:58:53.599 align:start position:0%
dispatched to these
 
01:58:56.390 --> 01:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh individuals who damage the highways
 
01:58:58.950 --> 01:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
or if we need to find a way to calculate
 
01:59:01.270 --> 01:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
the actual damages by
 
01:59:03.510 --> 01:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
going through all of the mass purchases
 
01:59:05.910 --> 01:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
and much larger expenditures that dlt
 
01:59:07.910 --> 01:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
has done you see if we can send out the
 
01:59:11.270 --> 01:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
actual damage for one guardrail person's
 
01:59:12.550 --> 01:59:12.560 align:start position:0%
the entire stretch of highway that was
 
01:59:16.070 --> 01:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
repaired at one time
 
01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:16.950 align:start position:0%
repaired at one time
yes

01:59:16.950 --> 01:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:59:18.310 --> 01:59:18.320 align:start position:0%
representative macbeth did you have a
 
01:59:20.709 --> 01:59:20.719 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes i do thank you mr chairman
 
01:59:21.750 --> 01:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:59:23.030 --> 01:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
i i
 
01:59:25.189 --> 01:59:25.199 align:start position:0%
attorney i'm just i i'm this is a new
 
01:59:26.790 --> 01:59:26.800 align:start position:0%
issue for me and i
 
01:59:29.109 --> 01:59:29.119 align:start position:0%
i'm just clarifying so um
 
01:59:31.270 --> 01:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
i think most of the people that are
 
01:59:34.870 --> 01:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh damaging our highways there's
 
01:59:35.910 --> 01:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
they're individuals these are
 
01:59:35.920 --> 01:59:37.189 align:start position:0%
they're individuals these are
individuals

01:59:37.189 --> 01:59:37.199 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
01:59:37.199 --> 01:59:37.990 align:start position:0%
individuals
and

01:59:37.990 --> 01:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:59:39.990 --> 01:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
i imagine a guardrail could be hundreds
 
01:59:41.910 --> 01:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
of thousands of dollars to replace if it
 
01:59:43.830 --> 01:59:43.840 align:start position:0%
was damaged is that what we're talking
 
01:59:45.669 --> 01:59:45.679 align:start position:0%
about we're talking about
 
01:59:48.070 --> 01:59:48.080 align:start position:0%
um people having accidents on the road
 
01:59:49.430 --> 01:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
and then them being
 
01:59:52.629 --> 01:59:52.639 align:start position:0%
strictly liable for any damage to
 
01:59:55.350 --> 01:59:55.360 align:start position:0%
highway signs and guardrails and
 
01:59:55.360 --> 01:59:57.189 align:start position:0%
highway signs and guardrails and
bridges

01:59:57.189 --> 01:59:57.199 align:start position:0%
bridges
 
01:59:58.550 --> 01:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am that is exactly what we're
 
02:00:01.430 --> 02:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
talking about uh to clarify though we
 
02:00:02.629 --> 02:00:02.639 align:start position:0%
are not talking in the hundreds of
 
02:00:05.109 --> 02:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars and
 
02:00:06.709 --> 02:00:06.719 align:start position:0%
while there are many individuals
 
02:00:08.070 --> 02:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
individuals i'd say make up a large
 
02:00:10.390 --> 02:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
percentage of those who use guardrails
 
02:00:12.310 --> 02:00:12.320 align:start position:0%
uh it also falls to businesses many
 
02:00:14.790 --> 02:00:14.800 align:start position:0%
businesses operate on the highways a lot
 
02:00:16.550 --> 02:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
of vehicles and many of them because of
 
02:00:17.990 --> 02:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
their size when they hit something they
 
02:00:20.070 --> 02:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
cause much higher damage
 
02:00:21.750 --> 02:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh ultimately the way that the
 
02:00:23.669 --> 02:00:23.679 align:start position:0%
calculations are currently occurring is
 
02:00:25.990 --> 02:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
it's based on individual units of the
 
02:00:27.589 --> 02:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
dark rail so when you drive down the
 
02:00:29.189 --> 02:00:29.199 align:start position:0%
highway you'll obviously see perhaps a
 
02:00:30.950 --> 02:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
mile long guardrail
 
02:00:33.350 --> 02:00:33.360 align:start position:0%
um if an individual will strike that
 
02:00:34.870 --> 02:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
they only get charged with a portion
 
02:00:36.550 --> 02:00:36.560 align:start position:0%
that actually needs to be prepared
 
02:00:38.310 --> 02:00:38.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes that's as little as a couple
 
02:00:40.870 --> 02:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars it could be a very easy
 
02:00:42.870 --> 02:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
pop it off and put in something new
 
02:00:44.950 --> 02:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
or sometimes people strike specialty
 
02:00:46.870 --> 02:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
parts regard rails specifically the
 
02:00:48.950 --> 02:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
start and end portions which are extra
 
02:00:51.189 --> 02:00:51.199 align:start position:0%
reinforced to help support and to
 
02:00:53.750 --> 02:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
mitigate impact when they are struck
 
02:00:56.470 --> 02:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
those can cost a few thousand dollars
 
02:00:56.480 --> 02:00:57.270 align:start position:0%
those can cost a few thousand dollars
uh

02:00:57.270 --> 02:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:00:59.270 --> 02:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
but it really depends on the
 
02:01:00.870 --> 02:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
level of the strike that happens uh
 
02:01:03.750 --> 02:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes people hit them and knock them
 
02:01:06.629 --> 02:01:06.639 align:start position:0%
out for a couple hundred yards
 
02:01:08.390 --> 02:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
that's much pricier than someone who
 
02:01:09.910 --> 02:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
just has a fender bender and ends up
 
02:01:11.750 --> 02:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
bending for one of the cardboards a
 
02:01:14.149 --> 02:01:14.159 align:start position:0%
little bit so there's a wide range
 
02:01:15.750 --> 02:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
and ultimately it does it does
 
02:01:18.070 --> 02:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
differently between individuals striking
 
02:01:22.870 --> 02:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:24.470 --> 02:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
representative chase
 
02:01:26.149 --> 02:01:26.159 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry representative macbeth did
 
02:01:29.109 --> 02:01:29.119 align:start position:0%
you have a last follow-up and i do and i
 
02:01:29.119 --> 02:01:29.990 align:start position:0%
you have a last follow-up and i do and i
just

02:01:29.990 --> 02:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:01:32.870 --> 02:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious is in attorney tolle's
 
02:01:35.109 --> 02:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
experience how many people's auto
 
02:01:36.950 --> 02:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
insurance covers
 
02:01:36.960 --> 02:01:37.830 align:start position:0%
insurance covers
this

02:01:37.830 --> 02:01:37.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:01:40.550 --> 02:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
this type of damage i've never i mean
 
02:01:43.350 --> 02:01:43.360 align:start position:0%
i'm going to check my policy now but i'm
 
02:01:44.870 --> 02:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
you know we write a lot of policies here
 
02:01:46.390 --> 02:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire i'm just wondering how
 
02:01:47.589 --> 02:01:47.599 align:start position:0%
many auto
 
02:01:49.109 --> 02:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
policies cover this or is this a
 
02:01:51.830 --> 02:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
personal liability usually i'm sure
 
02:01:52.950 --> 02:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
everyone's thinking that as they're
 
02:01:54.550 --> 02:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
hearing this now as well so that no this
 
02:01:56.070 --> 02:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
is something a lot of people don't don't
 
02:01:57.750 --> 02:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
really pay attention to until it happens
 
02:01:59.270 --> 02:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
to them
 
02:02:01.270 --> 02:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
dot can get much better numbers for how
 
02:02:02.709 --> 02:02:02.719 align:start position:0%
the actual
 
02:02:04.950 --> 02:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
insurance covers everything
 
02:02:06.310 --> 02:02:06.320 align:start position:0%
most of the cases that come to me are
 
02:02:08.550 --> 02:02:08.560 align:start position:0%
individuals who don't have insurance or
 
02:02:10.629 --> 02:02:10.639 align:start position:0%
insurance chose not to cover the plan
 
02:02:13.430 --> 02:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
for one reason or another whether it's
 
02:02:16.550 --> 02:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
an action on the individual side or just
 
02:02:17.990 --> 02:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
the coverage and
 
02:02:19.750 --> 02:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
extend that far
 
02:02:20.870 --> 02:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding though that a
 
02:02:22.550 --> 02:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
majority of the cases are covered by
 
02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:26.149 align:start position:0%
majority of the cases are covered by
insurance

02:02:26.149 --> 02:02:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:28.629 --> 02:02:28.639 align:start position:0%
thank you representative chase
 
02:02:30.470 --> 02:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
02:02:30.480 --> 02:02:31.510 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
questions

02:02:31.510 --> 02:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:02:34.149 --> 02:02:34.159 align:start position:0%
also attorney told so i
 
02:02:36.070 --> 02:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of the things that i had questions
 
02:02:37.750 --> 02:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
on were just
 
02:02:41.109 --> 02:02:41.119 align:start position:0%
answered that representative macbeth had
 
02:02:43.189 --> 02:02:43.199 align:start position:0%
but i do want to know
 
02:02:45.830 --> 02:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
to clarify for me that so say there's an
 
02:02:47.669 --> 02:02:47.679 align:start position:0%
accident and a bridge is hit or the
 
02:02:49.510 --> 02:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
guardrail something that makes it unsafe
 
02:02:52.149 --> 02:02:52.159 align:start position:0%
on the highways for people but the
 
02:02:54.390 --> 02:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
person who did the damage
 
02:02:57.350 --> 02:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't have that money right now so dot
 
02:02:59.109 --> 02:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
has this in the budget that they will go
 
02:03:00.550 --> 02:03:00.560 align:start position:0%
out and make these
 
02:03:03.589 --> 02:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
fixings and then make it deemed safe for
 
02:03:05.910 --> 02:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
people to ride on the road and then does
 
02:03:08.070 --> 02:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire file a case
 
02:03:09.990 --> 02:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
against the person who had the accident
 
02:03:12.390 --> 02:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
or did the damage is that how it works
 
02:03:12.400 --> 02:03:13.189 align:start position:0%
or did the damage is that how it works
or

02:03:13.189 --> 02:03:13.199 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:03:15.589 --> 02:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
do we wait until
 
02:03:17.270 --> 02:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
you get the money and then go out and
 
02:03:19.109 --> 02:03:19.119 align:start position:0%
fix it
 
02:03:20.470 --> 02:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
so once again this is a good question
 
02:03:21.750 --> 02:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
for dot just because they have much
 
02:03:23.669 --> 02:03:23.679 align:start position:0%
better information on their end of
 
02:03:25.750 --> 02:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
things what i can explain to is my my
 
02:03:27.510 --> 02:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
understanding and i've kind of worked
 
02:03:29.270 --> 02:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
through that exact process several times
 
02:03:32.310 --> 02:03:32.320 align:start position:0%
now where if someone collides with some
 
02:03:33.669 --> 02:03:33.679 align:start position:0%
part of the highway causing some damage
 
02:03:36.229 --> 02:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
to it dot will go out as quickly as
 
02:03:38.310 --> 02:03:38.320 align:start position:0%
possible to go and fix it to get it up
 
02:03:40.709 --> 02:03:40.719 align:start position:0%
to a usable safe level
 
02:03:42.790 --> 02:03:42.800 align:start position:0%
uh weather obviously affects that and
 
02:03:44.310 --> 02:03:44.320 align:start position:0%
the severity of the damage can affect
 
02:03:44.320 --> 02:03:45.109 align:start position:0%
the severity of the damage can affect
that

02:03:45.109 --> 02:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:03:47.990 --> 02:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
but typically it's as quick as they can
 
02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:49.350 align:start position:0%
but typically it's as quick as they can
uh

02:03:49.350 --> 02:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:03:51.109 --> 02:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
once someone has struck the guardrail
 
02:03:53.830 --> 02:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
dot will issue out a notice to them
 
02:03:56.149 --> 02:03:56.159 align:start position:0%
saying oh no you were found that you
 
02:03:58.229 --> 02:03:58.239 align:start position:0%
damaged this here's the invoice for the
 
02:04:00.709 --> 02:04:00.719 align:start position:0%
damage that occurred uh because of the
 
02:04:02.390 --> 02:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
fact that they can't always give the
 
02:04:04.629 --> 02:04:04.639 align:start position:0%
exact damages that occur due to just how
 
02:04:04.639 --> 02:04:05.430 align:start position:0%
exact damages that occur due to just how
much

02:04:05.430 --> 02:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:04:07.189 --> 02:04:07.199 align:start position:0%
how much stuff they're purchasing at one
 
02:04:09.109 --> 02:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
time to repair many parts of the highway
 
02:04:11.750 --> 02:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
at once uh they send out an estimate so
 
02:04:14.390 --> 02:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
typically d.o.t will dispatch one of its
 
02:04:16.069 --> 02:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
representatives they'll go and look at
 
02:04:17.510 --> 02:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
let's just say the guard rail that's
 
02:04:19.350 --> 02:04:19.360 align:start position:0%
like that
 
02:04:20.629 --> 02:04:20.639 align:start position:0%
they'll go and measure it and say oh
 
02:04:22.229 --> 02:04:22.239 align:start position:0%
this guard rail would damage in this way
 
02:04:23.830 --> 02:04:23.840 align:start position:0%
so we need to replace you know four
 
02:04:25.510 --> 02:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
posts and we need to
 
02:04:27.430 --> 02:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
replace this you know
 
02:04:29.669 --> 02:04:29.679 align:start position:0%
20 foot stretch of the actual guard
 
02:04:29.679 --> 02:04:30.709 align:start position:0%
20 foot stretch of the actual guard
system

02:04:30.709 --> 02:04:30.719 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:04:32.310 --> 02:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
they will then calculate how much does
 
02:04:34.149 --> 02:04:34.159 align:start position:0%
that cost to purchase and then send that
 
02:04:35.669 --> 02:04:35.679 align:start position:0%
estimate out to
 
02:04:36.870 --> 02:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
the individual who's been found
 
02:04:38.790 --> 02:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
responsible that individual will be
 
02:04:41.430 --> 02:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
given several notices uh dot is required
 
02:04:43.189 --> 02:04:43.199 align:start position:0%
to send out multiple notices some of
 
02:04:45.270 --> 02:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
these notices uh before it ever comes to
 
02:04:47.669 --> 02:04:47.679 align:start position:0%
me are required to inform that if no
 
02:04:49.350 --> 02:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
collection occurs it's going to be sent
 
02:04:51.109 --> 02:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
over to my office
 
02:04:53.189 --> 02:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
once dot has been unable to collect from
 
02:04:54.870 --> 02:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
one of these individuals they then
 
02:04:57.030 --> 02:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
contact my office we go through make
 
02:04:58.470 --> 02:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
sure that they've sent out the notices
 
02:04:59.669 --> 02:04:59.679 align:start position:0%
make sure this individual has been
 
02:05:01.030 --> 02:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
properly notified that they aren't
 
02:05:01.040 --> 02:05:02.470 align:start position:0%
properly notified that they aren't
liable

02:05:02.470 --> 02:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
liable
 
02:05:04.310 --> 02:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
and then once it comes to me my own
 
02:05:05.750 --> 02:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
practice is to reach out to the debtor
 
02:05:07.750 --> 02:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
myself either by phone or my letter
 
02:05:10.229 --> 02:05:10.239 align:start position:0%
email whatever correspondence i can make
 
02:05:12.229 --> 02:05:12.239 align:start position:0%
and to figure out what the situation is
 
02:05:14.069 --> 02:05:14.079 align:start position:0%
determine what their
 
02:05:15.830 --> 02:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
capacity is to pay
 
02:05:17.830 --> 02:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
typically that is sufficient i'm able to
 
02:05:19.189 --> 02:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
get people entered into some sort of
 
02:05:20.950 --> 02:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
payment agreement many people just need
 
02:05:22.709 --> 02:05:22.719 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to pay over time and they
 
02:05:24.629 --> 02:05:24.639 align:start position:0%
get nervous when they get told they owe
 
02:05:25.990 --> 02:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
a thousand dollars they think they'll
 
02:05:27.350 --> 02:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
have to buy their pocket like that
 
02:05:27.360 --> 02:05:28.709 align:start position:0%
have to buy their pocket like that
second

02:05:28.709 --> 02:05:28.719 align:start position:0%
second
 
02:05:28.719 --> 02:05:29.510 align:start position:0%
second
um

02:05:29.510 --> 02:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:31.030 --> 02:05:31.040 align:start position:0%
and typically that's that's as far as
 
02:05:32.629 --> 02:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
willing to go people make their payments
 
02:05:34.390 --> 02:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
and then they're all set
 
02:05:36.870 --> 02:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
up sometimes people want to challenge it
 
02:05:38.709 --> 02:05:38.719 align:start position:0%
some people like to
 
02:05:39.990 --> 02:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
push back and make sure that everything
 
02:05:42.390 --> 02:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
goes through proper relation channels in
 
02:05:44.550 --> 02:05:44.560 align:start position:0%
which case yes we do file litigation and
 
02:05:46.149 --> 02:05:46.159 align:start position:0%
then we'll go through that entire
 
02:05:48.310 --> 02:05:48.320 align:start position:0%
process until the matter was either
 
02:05:49.990 --> 02:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
resolved or
 
02:05:51.750 --> 02:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
it's determined that for whatever reason
 
02:05:53.669 --> 02:05:53.679 align:start position:0%
collection wouldn't be fair
 
02:05:55.109 --> 02:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
at that point but that that's more in
 
02:05:57.189 --> 02:05:57.199 align:start position:0%
the litigation area less than
 
02:06:03.189 --> 02:06:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:03.199 --> 02:06:04.069 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:06:04.069 --> 02:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:06:05.830 --> 02:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
representative chase
 
02:06:07.830 --> 02:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much so
 
02:06:11.030 --> 02:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
then there is a budget at dot to make
 
02:06:12.709 --> 02:06:12.719 align:start position:0%
these changes
 
02:06:14.950 --> 02:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh or not the changes but to to do the
 
02:06:17.910 --> 02:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
repairs and then they go after they send
 
02:06:20.950 --> 02:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
an invoice to people
 
02:06:22.790 --> 02:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
that is my understanding
 
02:06:24.470 --> 02:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
is that dod can get much better details
 
02:06:26.149 --> 02:06:26.159 align:start position:0%
on that okay
 
02:06:27.990 --> 02:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:06:29.669 --> 02:06:29.679 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan
 
02:06:31.030 --> 02:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
yes i would
 
02:06:32.950 --> 02:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
i have a question um
 
02:06:35.430 --> 02:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
i never even thought about this issue
 
02:06:37.270 --> 02:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
issue before but uh
 
02:06:39.750 --> 02:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
these guard rail which and these other
 
02:06:41.430 --> 02:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
things that people run into are
 
02:06:45.109 --> 02:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
typically replaced uh every every few
 
02:06:48.470 --> 02:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
decades anyway um you know
 
02:06:51.750 --> 02:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
what's um so do these are you are using
 
02:06:54.229 --> 02:06:54.239 align:start position:0%
a depreciated value where you use the
 
02:06:56.470 --> 02:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
percentage of the
 
02:06:56.480 --> 02:06:57.589 align:start position:0%
percentage of the
items

02:06:57.589 --> 02:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
items
 
02:06:59.750 --> 02:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh useful life that's or even used up or
 
02:07:01.510 --> 02:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
you're trying to charge people for the
 
02:07:06.629 --> 02:07:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:09.109 --> 02:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
of course i can't speak to what dot's
 
02:07:10.950 --> 02:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
overall practices are once again only a
 
02:07:13.430 --> 02:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
certain percentage ever reach my office
 
02:07:15.189 --> 02:07:15.199 align:start position:0%
uh what i can tell you though is many of
 
02:07:17.270 --> 02:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
the cases that reach my office uh if it
 
02:07:18.950 --> 02:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
has been an older
 
02:07:20.550 --> 02:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
guardrail it's something that they were
 
02:07:22.550 --> 02:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
sometimes even in the process of fixing
 
02:07:24.870 --> 02:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
when it gets struck
 
02:07:26.229 --> 02:07:26.239 align:start position:0%
based on my review of the numbers it
 
02:07:28.149 --> 02:07:28.159 align:start position:0%
does appear that they go on what was the
 
02:07:30.790 --> 02:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
actual value of the item construct and
 
02:07:30.800 --> 02:07:31.990 align:start position:0%
actual value of the item construct and
not

02:07:31.990 --> 02:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:07:33.830 --> 02:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
what would be the cost of the brand new
 
02:07:36.870 --> 02:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
item to put it in uh ultimately that
 
02:07:38.950 --> 02:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
does vary i had after that put an
 
02:07:40.310 --> 02:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
asterisk next to that just because there
 
02:07:42.149 --> 02:07:42.159 align:start position:0%
are certain items that
 
02:07:43.669 --> 02:07:43.679 align:start position:0%
while they may have hit and destroyed it
 
02:07:46.470 --> 02:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
the only way to replace it now is by
 
02:07:48.470 --> 02:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
getting a more expensive item
 
02:07:50.069 --> 02:07:50.079 align:start position:0%
uh my what i always jumped through the
 
02:07:52.229 --> 02:07:52.239 align:start position:0%
example is the end posts for a lot of
 
02:07:53.910 --> 02:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
these guard rails are very expensive
 
02:07:55.589 --> 02:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
very specialty items
 
02:07:57.750 --> 02:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
an old one may have been
 
02:07:59.189 --> 02:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
you know put in like you said couple
 
02:08:00.709 --> 02:08:00.719 align:start position:0%
decades ago
 
02:08:02.069 --> 02:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
it may only be worth a couple hundred
 
02:08:03.910 --> 02:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
dollars at this point but to replace it
 
02:08:03.920 --> 02:08:04.709 align:start position:0%
dollars at this point but to replace it
is

02:08:04.709 --> 02:08:04.719 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:08:07.030 --> 02:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
much more expensive uh i do want in my
 
02:08:08.470 --> 02:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
understanding that eot does take that
 
02:08:10.229 --> 02:08:10.239 align:start position:0%
into consideration and is willing to
 
02:08:11.510 --> 02:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
work with
 
02:08:13.589 --> 02:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
anyone who strikes it to figure out what
 
02:08:16.950 --> 02:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
would be the fair compensation for that
 
02:08:20.229 --> 02:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:20.239 --> 02:08:21.030 align:start position:0%
 
just

02:08:21.030 --> 02:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:08:23.589 --> 02:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
had a uh just a sort of a follow-up
 
02:08:23.599 --> 02:08:24.709 align:start position:0%
had a uh just a sort of a follow-up
question

02:08:24.709 --> 02:08:24.719 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:08:27.430 --> 02:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:29.430 --> 02:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
i and i guess i'm looking for
 
02:08:29.440 --> 02:08:30.310 align:start position:0%
i and i guess i'm looking for
your

02:08:30.310 --> 02:08:30.320 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:08:31.990 --> 02:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
legal opinion more than anything else
 
02:08:33.430 --> 02:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
and that is you're you're changing the
 
02:08:35.830 --> 02:08:35.840 align:start position:0%
standard of proof in this particular
 
02:08:38.310 --> 02:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
case from
 
02:08:40.550 --> 02:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
having to prove fault to strict
 
02:08:40.560 --> 02:08:42.229 align:start position:0%
having to prove fault to strict
liability

02:08:42.229 --> 02:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
liability
 
02:08:44.790 --> 02:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
and you testified earlier i think that
 
02:08:46.069 --> 02:08:46.079 align:start position:0%
this was just
 
02:08:48.149 --> 02:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
remedial action you consider that to be
 
02:08:48.159 --> 02:08:50.310 align:start position:0%
remedial action you consider that to be
remedial

02:08:50.310 --> 02:08:50.320 align:start position:0%
remedial
 
02:08:52.470 --> 02:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
yes i do sir if only for the fact that
 
02:08:53.910 --> 02:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
the courts have
 
02:08:56.229 --> 02:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
interpreted this statute to already be a
 
02:08:58.390 --> 02:08:58.400 align:start position:0%
strict liability standard uh by using
 
02:09:01.030 --> 02:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
the language i know i'll rejoice he or
 
02:09:03.430 --> 02:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
she shall be liable to the state for all
 
02:09:05.109 --> 02:09:05.119 align:start position:0%
damages of the highway
 
02:09:07.030 --> 02:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
though that does not use the word strict
 
02:09:09.910 --> 02:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
for a liability definition saying shall
 
02:09:11.430 --> 02:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
be liable
 
02:09:13.030 --> 02:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
the state is consistently arguing the
 
02:09:15.030 --> 02:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
courts have consistently agreed that
 
02:09:17.910 --> 02:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
that does in tone strict liability our
 
02:09:19.189 --> 02:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
purpose for adding in the language at
 
02:09:21.350 --> 02:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
this point is to ensure there's clarity
 
02:09:23.990 --> 02:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
for any lay person who does read the law
 
02:09:25.830 --> 02:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
they'll understand oh that is what it is
 
02:09:27.270 --> 02:09:27.280 align:start position:0%
instead of having to go through and
 
02:09:27.280 --> 02:09:28.390 align:start position:0%
instead of having to go through and
review

02:09:28.390 --> 02:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
review
 
02:09:32.870 --> 02:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:38.229 --> 02:09:38.239 align:start position:0%

i
 
02:11:23.430 --> 02:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
as others have indicated these bills
 
02:11:25.510 --> 02:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
passed as standalone bills passed the
 
02:11:27.030 --> 02:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
senate last year
 
02:11:29.589 --> 02:11:29.599 align:start position:0%
were not acted upon in the house
 
02:11:32.229 --> 02:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
and judge david king the administrative
 
02:11:34.790 --> 02:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
judge of the circuit court reviewed
 
02:11:36.950 --> 02:11:36.960 align:start position:0%

02:11:39.510 --> 02:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
changes to the waiver of administration
 
02:11:41.750 --> 02:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
um statute i just wanted to be clear he
 
02:11:44.390 --> 02:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
he did not provide comment on the other
 
02:11:44.400 --> 02:11:45.189 align:start position:0%
he did not provide comment on the other
um

02:11:45.189 --> 02:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:47.910 --> 02:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
portions of of the proposed part
 
02:11:47.920 --> 02:11:48.870 align:start position:0%
portions of of the proposed part
seven

02:11:48.870 --> 02:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
seven
 
02:11:48.880 --> 02:11:49.669 align:start position:0%
seven
um

02:11:49.669 --> 02:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:51.109 --> 02:11:51.119 align:start position:0%
i wanna i wanna be brief because i know
 
02:11:52.629 --> 02:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
others have already testified i know
 
02:11:54.470 --> 02:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
it's been a long hearing i just wanted
 
02:11:56.790 --> 02:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
to touch on a couple of things so as
 
02:11:58.629 --> 02:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
others said the waiver of administration
 
02:12:00.629 --> 02:12:00.639 align:start position:0%
process it's a process that's been in
 
02:12:03.510 --> 02:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire law since 2002
 
02:12:05.830 --> 02:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
its applicability has been expanded
 
02:12:07.350 --> 02:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
several times
 
02:12:09.350 --> 02:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
and i think the best way to describe it
 
02:12:11.270 --> 02:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
is essentially an abbreviated probate
 
02:12:13.109 --> 02:12:13.119 align:start position:0%
process where the legislature has
 
02:12:14.950 --> 02:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
determined that the full
 
02:12:17.430 --> 02:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
probate process involving an inventory
 
02:12:19.830 --> 02:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
an accounting and the posting of a bond
 
02:12:21.910 --> 02:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
is not necessary
 
02:12:23.750 --> 02:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
currently it only applies where there's
 
02:12:25.830 --> 02:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
only a single beneficiary of an estate
 
02:12:28.390 --> 02:12:28.400 align:start position:0%
and that person is a spouse a child or a
 
02:12:30.950 --> 02:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
trust and it does not currently apply
 
02:12:32.950 --> 02:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
where there is more than one beneficiary
 
02:12:34.950 --> 02:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
or where the sole beneficiary is someone
 
02:12:37.430 --> 02:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
other than a spouse child or trust such
 
02:12:39.990 --> 02:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
as a sibling a friend or an unmarried
 
02:12:41.589 --> 02:12:41.599 align:start position:0%
significant other
 
02:12:43.510 --> 02:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
and this bill would essentially expand
 
02:12:46.390 --> 02:12:46.400 align:start position:0%
waiver to cover all estates
 
02:12:48.470 --> 02:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
where there's either a sole beneficiary
 
02:12:50.870 --> 02:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
and that beneficiary is administrator or
 
02:12:52.629 --> 02:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
where there are multiple beneficiaries
 
02:12:54.470 --> 02:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
and they're all co-administrators or
 
02:12:56.149 --> 02:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
they all assent to the appointment of
 
02:12:57.990 --> 02:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
one of them or someone else as
 
02:13:00.390 --> 02:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
administrator or where it's otherwise
 
02:13:01.990 --> 02:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate in the discretion of the
 
02:13:04.229 --> 02:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
court and in short the concept is for
 
02:13:06.790 --> 02:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
those estates that are uncontested where
 
02:13:08.950 --> 02:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
no one where none of the beneficiaries
 
02:13:11.270 --> 02:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
or interested parties
 
02:13:12.950 --> 02:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
such as a creditor would be asking the
 
02:13:15.109 --> 02:13:15.119 align:start position:0%
court to have the full process that it's
 
02:13:17.189 --> 02:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
not a good use of resources either of
 
02:13:19.830 --> 02:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
the estate or of the the taxpayers
 
02:13:22.229 --> 02:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
funding the judiciary to have these
 
02:13:24.629 --> 02:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
extra court um procedures you know
 
02:13:26.149 --> 02:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
waiver as i said has been around since
 
02:13:30.709 --> 02:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
2002 it works very well in the estates
 
02:13:32.310 --> 02:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
where it applies
 
02:13:35.669 --> 02:13:35.679 align:start position:0%
and um having it expanded to uncontested
 
02:13:37.270 --> 02:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
estates um
 
02:13:39.109 --> 02:13:39.119 align:start position:0%
i i think is you know consistent both
 
02:13:40.550 --> 02:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
with the direction other states have
 
02:13:40.560 --> 02:13:41.430 align:start position:0%
with the direction other states have
gone

02:13:41.430 --> 02:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
gone
 
02:13:43.830 --> 02:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
um and and would you know i think make
 
02:13:46.629 --> 02:13:46.639 align:start position:0%
lives easier for um
 
02:13:48.709 --> 02:13:48.719 align:start position:0%
for folks administering estates in new
 
02:13:51.830 --> 02:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire that are uncontested um to be
 
02:13:53.910 --> 02:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
clear the regular probate process would
 
02:13:56.470 --> 02:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
remain available and would of course
 
02:13:59.030 --> 02:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
remain appropriate in contested estates
 
02:14:00.629 --> 02:14:00.639 align:start position:0%
or were there simply a lack of trust
 
02:14:02.709 --> 02:14:02.719 align:start position:0%
between beneficiaries
 
02:14:05.350 --> 02:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
any any beneficiary
 
02:14:06.950 --> 02:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
you know has the any interested person
 
02:14:08.709 --> 02:14:08.719 align:start position:0%
has the option to petition for full
 
02:14:10.950 --> 02:14:10.960 align:start position:0%
administration at any time while the
 
02:14:12.950 --> 02:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
estate remains open that's in current
 
02:14:16.149 --> 02:14:16.159 align:start position:0%
law and that's maintained in the bill
 
02:14:17.669 --> 02:14:17.679 align:start position:0%
and in the states with more than one
 
02:14:19.990 --> 02:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
beneficiary the simplified process would
 
02:14:21.589 --> 02:14:21.599 align:start position:0%
not be available unless they all
 
02:14:24.069 --> 02:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
affirmatively agreed to have it apply um
 
02:14:26.790 --> 02:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
so those are some safeguards importantly
 
02:14:28.390 --> 02:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
creditors would retain all the
 
02:14:30.629 --> 02:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
protections they have under current law
 
02:14:32.790 --> 02:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
including the six-month creditor claims
 
02:14:32.800 --> 02:14:33.750 align:start position:0%
including the six-month creditor claims
period

02:14:33.750 --> 02:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
period
 
02:14:35.510 --> 02:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
during which assets can't get
 
02:14:37.750 --> 02:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
distributed to beneficiaries
 
02:14:40.310 --> 02:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
that right to seek full administration
 
02:14:42.069 --> 02:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
and the protections of the insolvent
 
02:14:44.310 --> 02:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
estate process when
 
02:14:46.709 --> 02:14:46.719 align:start position:0%
assets are not adequate
 
02:14:47.669 --> 02:14:47.679 align:start position:0%
to pay
 
02:14:47.679 --> 02:14:49.350 align:start position:0%
to pay
debts

02:14:49.350 --> 02:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
debts
 
02:14:50.709 --> 02:14:50.719 align:start position:0%
the bill also makes a couple of other
 
02:14:52.870 --> 02:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
helpful changes it explicitly allows the
 
02:14:54.709 --> 02:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
court to grant an extension to the
 
02:14:57.109 --> 02:14:57.119 align:start position:0%
one-year deadline for essentially
 
02:14:58.870 --> 02:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
closing an estate in a waiver of
 
02:15:01.430 --> 02:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
administration process under current law
 
02:15:02.950 --> 02:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
that's not clear
 
02:15:04.470 --> 02:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
and different judges have taken
 
02:15:06.310 --> 02:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
different views as to whether or not
 
02:15:08.870 --> 02:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
they can extend that deadline
 
02:15:10.550 --> 02:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
and the bill also makes clear how
 
02:15:12.310 --> 02:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
deadlines would operate if you have an
 
02:15:14.229 --> 02:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
estate that starts out in the waiver
 
02:15:16.310 --> 02:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
process and then subsequently becomes
 
02:15:18.229 --> 02:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
full administration and that's something
 
02:15:20.470 --> 02:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
else that's not clear under current law
 
02:15:21.910 --> 02:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
and has sometimes resulted in
 
02:15:24.069 --> 02:15:24.079 align:start position:0%
inconsistent application
 
02:15:25.830 --> 02:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
and confusion
 
02:15:27.589 --> 02:15:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh section three would resolve an
 
02:15:29.669 --> 02:15:29.679 align:start position:0%
ambiguity in the intestacy statute
 
02:15:33.030 --> 02:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
without any uh substantive change being
 
02:15:33.040 --> 02:15:34.950 align:start position:0%
without any uh substantive change being
intended

02:15:34.950 --> 02:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
intended
 
02:15:36.709 --> 02:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
sections four through seven deal with
 
02:15:38.629 --> 02:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
the uniform power of attorney act which
 
02:15:41.990 --> 02:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
became law on january 1 2018 and these
 
02:15:43.589 --> 02:15:43.599 align:start position:0%
amendments are largely to take into
 
02:15:45.510 --> 02:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
account experience practitioners have
 
02:15:48.470 --> 02:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
had with the law you know over its first
 
02:15:51.350 --> 02:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
three years of existence uh um as well
 
02:15:53.350 --> 02:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
as to update it to reference um to
 
02:15:55.830 --> 02:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
cross-reference another law the revised
 
02:15:58.709 --> 02:15:58.719 align:start position:0%
uniform fiduciary access to digital
 
02:16:01.990 --> 02:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
assets act which um became law in in
 
02:16:04.390 --> 02:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
june of 2019 after the
 
02:16:05.910 --> 02:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
power of attorney act had gone into
 
02:16:08.390 --> 02:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
effect um the year before
 
02:16:11.350 --> 02:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
um in particular uh
 
02:16:14.310 --> 02:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
section seven amends the form there's a
 
02:16:17.669 --> 02:16:17.679 align:start position:0%
statutory form that individuals can use
 
02:16:19.430 --> 02:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
that to make a valid power of attorney
 
02:16:21.990 --> 02:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and in addition to some
 
02:16:24.390 --> 02:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
clarifying amendments
 
02:16:26.390 --> 02:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
there are a number of additions to that
 
02:16:28.390 --> 02:16:28.400 align:start position:0%
form that would allow
 
02:16:31.270 --> 02:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
individuals to be more specific and have
 
02:16:32.629 --> 02:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
more choice
 
02:16:34.070 --> 02:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
about when
 
02:16:36.469 --> 02:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
and whether they'd authorize gifting to
 
02:16:37.669 --> 02:16:37.679 align:start position:0%
take place
 
02:16:39.349 --> 02:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
provisions in a financial power of
 
02:16:41.349 --> 02:16:41.359 align:start position:0%
attorney allowing an agent to make gifts
 
02:16:44.070 --> 02:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
or to benefit themselves are essential
 
02:16:46.070 --> 02:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
in some situations but unfortunately
 
02:16:48.469 --> 02:16:48.479 align:start position:0%
provide opportunities for abuse in
 
02:16:50.629 --> 02:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
others so based on experience with the
 
02:16:50.639 --> 02:16:51.509 align:start position:0%
others so based on experience with the
form

02:16:51.509 --> 02:16:51.519 align:start position:0%
form
 
02:16:53.750 --> 02:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh the the the folks involved in
 
02:16:55.830 --> 02:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
drafting you know try to realize the
 
02:16:58.309 --> 02:16:58.319 align:start position:0%
goal of maximizing flexibility for
 
02:17:00.070 --> 02:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
individual users of the form while
 
02:17:02.629 --> 02:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
minimizing the opportunity for abuse by
 
02:17:04.230 --> 02:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
empowering those who use the form to
 
02:17:06.469 --> 02:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
make deliberate specific
 
02:17:08.549 --> 02:17:08.559 align:start position:0%
and if they wish narrow choices you know
 
02:17:11.270 --> 02:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
as appropriate for their situation
 
02:17:11.280 --> 02:17:13.110 align:start position:0%
as appropriate for their situation
finally

02:17:13.110 --> 02:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
finally
 
02:17:16.230 --> 02:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
sections nine and ten um are uh were a
 
02:17:19.589 --> 02:17:19.599 align:start position:0%
separate standalone bill last year um
 
02:17:19.599 --> 02:17:20.549 align:start position:0%
separate standalone bill last year um
the

02:17:20.549 --> 02:17:20.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:17:22.950 --> 02:17:22.960 align:start position:0%
to to update the uniform disclaimer of
 
02:17:25.429 --> 02:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
property interest act uh new hampshire's
 
02:17:28.790 --> 02:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
current act um was enacted in 1996 and
 
02:17:31.669 --> 02:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
became effective january 1 of 97 and has
 
02:17:34.150 --> 02:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
not been amended since so this act would
 
02:17:36.709 --> 02:17:36.719 align:start position:0%
update it with the new uniform act
 
02:17:38.389 --> 02:17:38.399 align:start position:0%
with some changes that are specific to
 
02:17:40.230 --> 02:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
new hampshire including as i think
 
02:17:41.990 --> 02:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
someone else pointed out changes
 
02:17:43.750 --> 02:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
requested by the department of health
 
02:17:45.910 --> 02:17:45.920 align:start position:0%

disclaimer
 
02:17:49.589 --> 02:17:49.599 align:start position:0%
can't be used to impair

we don't have any position on any of the
 
02:19:33.669 --> 02:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
other parts of this omnibus legislation
 
02:19:36.469 --> 02:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
by way of background in 2016 a bill was
 
02:19:38.469 --> 02:19:38.479 align:start position:0%
signed into law prohibiting the shining
 
02:19:40.790 --> 02:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
of a laser pointing device at an
 
02:19:42.629 --> 02:19:42.639 align:start position:0%
airplane law enforcement officer law
 
02:19:44.950 --> 02:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement vehicle or other persons or
 
02:19:44.960 --> 02:19:46.070 align:start position:0%
enforcement vehicle or other persons or
structures

02:19:46.070 --> 02:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
structures
 
02:19:47.910 --> 02:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
the bill was in response to such laser
 
02:19:50.150 --> 02:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
pointer incidents in the state and
 
02:19:53.110 --> 02:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
nationwide the 2016 law included very
 
02:19:54.790 --> 02:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
limited exceptions which had the
 
02:19:57.190 --> 02:19:57.200 align:start position:0%
unintentional effect of making some of
 
02:19:59.190 --> 02:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
today's everyday uses of lasers
 
02:20:01.510 --> 02:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
potentially illegal from vehicle sensors
 
02:20:04.389 --> 02:20:04.399 align:start position:0%
to the latest consumer electronics
 
02:20:07.349 --> 02:20:07.359 align:start position:0%
our company became aware of this issue
 
02:20:09.030 --> 02:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
with the new hampshire state law about a
 
02:20:10.230 --> 02:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
year ago
 
02:20:12.150 --> 02:20:12.160 align:start position:0%
at the time it was too late to seek any
 
02:20:14.550 --> 02:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
legislative remedy
 
02:20:16.389 --> 02:20:16.399 align:start position:0%
the reason we approached senator carson
 
02:20:17.830 --> 02:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
with this issue
 
02:20:19.670 --> 02:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
is that the law also prohibits some of
 
02:20:21.590 --> 02:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
the research development and testing
 
02:20:23.429 --> 02:20:23.439 align:start position:0%
work that aerospace and defense
 
02:20:25.750 --> 02:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
technology companies like bae systems
 
02:20:27.990 --> 02:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
conduct with lasers
 
02:20:30.070 --> 02:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
to be clear bae systems takes every
 
02:20:31.990 --> 02:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
precaution to legally work around the
 
02:20:34.150 --> 02:20:34.160 align:start position:0%
unintended prohibitions set forth in the
 
02:20:36.950 --> 02:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
2016 law until the legislator can
 
02:20:38.469 --> 02:20:38.479 align:start position:0%
provide a remedy
 
02:20:40.230 --> 02:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
in addition we are not aware of any law
 
02:20:42.389 --> 02:20:42.399 align:start position:0%
enforcement entity interpreting and
 
02:20:44.309 --> 02:20:44.319 align:start position:0%
enforcing the statute beyond the intent
 
02:20:47.110 --> 02:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
of the law as it is currently
 
02:20:48.790 --> 02:20:48.800 align:start position:0%
however we do believe appropriate
 
02:20:50.389 --> 02:20:50.399 align:start position:0%
exemptions should be placed in the
 
02:20:52.870 --> 02:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
statute to clarify lawful uses while
 
02:20:54.710 --> 02:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
ensuring that malicious use of lasers
 
02:20:57.270 --> 02:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
and laser pointers remains prohibited
 
02:20:58.630 --> 02:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
i'd like to thank the department of
 
02:21:01.030 --> 02:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
safety transportation
 
02:21:02.790 --> 02:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
and fish and game for their willingness
 
02:21:04.950 --> 02:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
to provide feedback to us as we worked
 
02:21:07.510 --> 02:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
to provide a solution for legislators to
 
02:21:07.520 --> 02:21:08.790 align:start position:0%
to provide a solution for legislators to
consider

02:21:08.790 --> 02:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
consider
 
02:21:10.630 --> 02:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
i respectfully request that the
 
02:21:12.630 --> 02:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
committee recommends ought to pass with
 
02:21:15.110 --> 02:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
the amendment we're seeking on part one
 
02:21:17.510 --> 02:21:17.520 align:start position:0%

uh on behalf here today of va systems of
 
02:21:49.190 --> 02:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
course um very quickly regarding the
 
02:21:51.190 --> 02:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
amendment and members of the committee i
 
02:21:52.790 --> 02:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
did send over
 
02:21:55.190 --> 02:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
late friday all of the written materials
 
02:21:56.389 --> 02:21:56.399 align:start position:0%
a letter from
 
02:21:59.349 --> 02:21:59.359 align:start position:0%
ba systems a one-page overview of the
 
02:22:02.309 --> 02:22:02.319 align:start position:0%
the bill itself uh and then a
 
02:22:04.790 --> 02:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh and then a uh just a quick half a
 
02:22:07.270 --> 02:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
page or so on the amendment uh as well
 
02:22:10.469 --> 02:22:10.479 align:start position:0%
as miss poitras's testimony so you
 
02:22:12.070 --> 02:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
should have all that i'm happy to resend
 
02:22:14.230 --> 02:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
as necessary regarding the amendment uh
 
02:22:16.309 --> 02:22:16.319 align:start position:0%
this is just a technical amendment and
 
02:22:18.550 --> 02:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
i'm certainly not speaking for d.o.t but
 
02:22:20.950 --> 02:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh they've indicated that they're
 
02:22:22.550 --> 02:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
that they're very comfortable with the
 
02:22:25.190 --> 02:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
amendment uh back in
 
02:22:25.200 --> 02:22:26.630 align:start position:0%
amendment uh back in
2016

02:22:26.630 --> 02:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
2016
 
02:22:28.630 --> 02:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
when the original bill
 
02:22:31.510 --> 02:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
banning the shining of lasers uh laser
 
02:22:35.110 --> 02:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
pointers at aircraft or uh the other uh
 
02:22:37.030 --> 02:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
structures and so on that you've heard
 
02:22:37.040 --> 02:22:37.990 align:start position:0%
structures and so on that you've heard
already

02:22:37.990 --> 02:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
already
 
02:22:40.550 --> 02:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
when that became law they needed to in
 
02:22:42.790 --> 02:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
order to affect that prohibition they
 
02:22:43.990 --> 02:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
needed to
 
02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:45.030 align:start position:0%
needed to
amend

02:22:45.030 --> 02:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
amend
 
02:22:46.870 --> 02:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
two chapters of
 
02:22:50.389 --> 02:22:50.399 align:start position:0%
new hampshire rsas the first was 631
 
02:22:51.429 --> 02:22:51.439 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
02:22:54.790 --> 02:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
and i don't mean to oversimplify uh but
 
02:22:57.750 --> 02:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh that that for the point of this
 
02:22:57.760 --> 02:22:58.790 align:start position:0%
uh that that for the point of this
um

02:22:58.790 --> 02:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:00.630 --> 02:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
this issue this prohibition deals with
 
02:23:00.640 --> 02:23:01.429 align:start position:0%
this issue this prohibition deals with
the

02:23:01.429 --> 02:23:01.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:23:03.590 --> 02:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
items that are on the ground uh so the
 
02:23:03.600 --> 02:23:04.710 align:start position:0%
items that are on the ground uh so the
buildings

02:23:04.710 --> 02:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
02:23:07.030 --> 02:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
people and airplanes
 
02:23:11.950 --> 02:23:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:15.270 --> 02:23:15.280 align:start position:0%
rsa422 that is the the aeronautics act
 
02:23:17.270 --> 02:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
and so in order to make sure that the
 
02:23:19.510 --> 02:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
prohibition was extended to planes while
 
02:23:21.750 --> 02:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
in flight which i believe the legal
 
02:23:25.190 --> 02:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
definition is um taxiing uh takeoff
 
02:23:28.309 --> 02:23:28.319 align:start position:0%
landing and actually you know in flight
 
02:23:30.550 --> 02:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
uh the the prohibition had to be written
 
02:23:33.590 --> 02:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
there as well unfortunately just due to
 
02:23:33.600 --> 02:23:34.389 align:start position:0%
there as well unfortunately just due to
a

02:23:34.389 --> 02:23:34.399 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:23:36.230 --> 02:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
in oversight as this was moving through
 
02:23:39.429 --> 02:23:39.439 align:start position:0%
the senate uh the bill before you part
 
02:23:39.439 --> 02:23:40.309 align:start position:0%
the senate uh the bill before you part
one

02:23:40.309 --> 02:23:40.319 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:23:46.070 --> 02:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
did not um did not update rsa 422
 
02:23:49.349 --> 02:23:49.359 align:start position:0%
as it did rsa 631 so it didn't update
 
02:23:49.359 --> 02:23:51.190 align:start position:0%
as it did rsa 631 so it didn't update
422

02:23:51.190 --> 02:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
422
 
02:23:52.710 --> 02:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
to make sure that
 
02:23:55.670 --> 02:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
the prohibition extended to using drones
 
02:23:55.680 --> 02:23:56.630 align:start position:0%
the prohibition extended to using drones
uh

02:23:56.630 --> 02:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:23:58.710 --> 02:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
right now in theory someone could use a
 
02:24:01.030 --> 02:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
laser pointer mounted on a drone and
 
02:24:02.870 --> 02:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
shine that at a plane and that in theory
 
02:24:04.630 --> 02:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
would not be
 
02:24:06.389 --> 02:24:06.399 align:start position:0%
a violation of new hampshire law so this
 
02:24:08.630 --> 02:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
updates that and then also
 
02:24:11.270 --> 02:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
points back to
 
02:24:13.429 --> 02:24:13.439 align:start position:0%
what the bill is proposing to carve out
 
02:24:16.070 --> 02:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
four exceptions um to the use of laser
 
02:24:17.990 --> 02:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
pointers that would
 
02:24:20.950 --> 02:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
that would be in in rsa 631
 
02:24:24.309 --> 02:24:24.319 align:start position:0%
so um i i hope i hope i'm not uh making
 
02:24:26.550 --> 02:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
this more confusing
 
02:24:28.309 --> 02:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
but again it was just to make sure that
 
02:24:31.270 --> 02:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
we were applying the uh the updates and
 
02:24:34.150 --> 02:24:34.160 align:start position:0%
uh the exclusions uh
 
02:24:36.550 --> 02:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
equally um
 
02:24:38.870 --> 02:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
in into both statutes as the original
 
02:24:41.750 --> 02:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
law did and as uh and as was intended as
 
02:24:43.510 --> 02:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
this bill was moving through the through
 
02:24:46.230 --> 02:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
the senate uh and i'm happy to
 
02:24:47.910 --> 02:24:47.920 align:start position:0%

you heard mention of two
 
02:27:09.510 --> 02:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
by senator geider earlier i would also
 
02:27:12.469 --> 02:27:12.479 align:start position:0%

their report has served as a blueprint
 
02:28:43.990 --> 02:28:44.000 align:start position:0%

implementing police reform and one of
 
02:28:51.030 --> 02:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
the recommendations of that report is
 
02:28:54.469 --> 02:28:54.479 align:start position:0%
that the cit training should be provided
 
02:28:57.429 --> 02:28:57.439 align:start position:0%
to every law enforcement officer
 
02:28:59.510 --> 02:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
in the country
 
02:29:02.469 --> 02:29:02.479 align:start position:0%
nami new hampshire has a certified cit

02:29:14.469 --> 02:29:14.479 align:start position:0%
and uh and the other part to the

training in
 
02:29:18.309 --> 02:29:18.319 align:start position:0%
in addition to those de-escalation
 
02:29:20.309 --> 02:29:20.319 align:start position:0%
strategies and communications pieces
 
02:29:22.230 --> 02:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
extensive playing
 
02:29:24.870 --> 02:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
with real life scenarios most of the
 
02:29:27.510 --> 02:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
actors and i put that in quote are
 
02:29:30.070 --> 02:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
people that have mental illness or their
 
02:29:32.630 --> 02:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
family members who have
 
02:29:34.389 --> 02:29:34.399 align:start position:0%

response and nami new hampshire has
 
02:29:40.309 --> 02:29:40.319 align:start position:0%
trained in the to serve in these roles
 
02:29:41.670 --> 02:29:41.680 align:start position:0%
of cit
 
02:29:44.150 --> 02:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
training the other really key part of
 
02:29:44.160 --> 02:29:45.349 align:start position:0%
training the other really key part of
this

02:29:45.349 --> 02:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:29:48.389 --> 02:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
training is that it focuses on
 
02:29:51.429 --> 02:29:51.439 align:start position:0%
officers own wellness and resilience and
 
02:29:52.870 --> 02:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
what mental health supports are
 
02:29:54.550 --> 02:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
available to them
 
02:29:56.710 --> 02:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
rates of suicide among law enforcement
 
02:29:58.309 --> 02:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
are significantly higher than the
 
02:30:01.190 --> 02:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
general population as are rates of
 
02:30:04.790 --> 02:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
depression and um and ptsd and sadly
 
02:30:07.030 --> 02:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
more law enforcement officers die by
 
02:30:10.070 --> 02:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
suicide than in the line of duty and new
 
02:30:11.670 --> 02:30:11.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire has certainly experienced
 
02:30:13.750 --> 02:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
several of these tragic
 
02:30:15.990 --> 02:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
deaths in the past few years
 
02:30:18.469 --> 02:30:18.479 align:start position:0%
the demand for this type of training is
 
02:30:22.309 --> 02:30:22.319 align:start position:0%
very high and uh and when we offer it um
 
02:30:25.429 --> 02:30:25.439 align:start position:0%
we typically uh run out of space 25 to
 
02:30:28.150 --> 02:30:28.160 align:start position:0%
30 people within several hours and and
 
02:30:31.590 --> 02:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
have a waiting list and as you heard
 
02:30:34.230 --> 02:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
senator goddess say this training this
 
02:30:35.910 --> 02:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
grant that we've been operating under is
 
02:30:39.510 --> 02:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
due to to run out um and uh and
 
02:30:41.590 --> 02:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
therefore we've submitted this bill so i
 
02:30:43.349 --> 02:30:43.359 align:start position:0%
would ask for your support for section
 
02:30:46.309 --> 02:30:46.319 align:start position:0%

thank you very much mr chair and thank
 
02:30:58.070 --> 02:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
you mr norton for taking my question
 
02:30:59.510 --> 02:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
you answered some of them but i want to
 
02:31:01.349 --> 02:31:01.359 align:start position:0%
make sure i got my hand up so the
 
02:31:04.230 --> 02:31:04.240 align:start position:0%
funding right now um the senator said is
 
02:31:04.240 --> 02:31:05.830 align:start position:0%
funding right now um the senator said is
through

02:31:05.830 --> 02:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:31:05.840 --> 02:31:06.550 align:start position:0%
through
a

02:31:06.550 --> 02:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:31:08.630 --> 02:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
it's through the federal funding and
 
02:31:12.070 --> 02:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
then it trickles down into the state
 
02:31:14.950 --> 02:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
and is you have a wait list you said 25
 
02:31:17.510 --> 02:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
to 30 people who sign up at a time how
 
02:31:20.230 --> 02:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
often are these trainings given
 
02:31:22.469 --> 02:31:22.479 align:start position:0%
and how long is the training and then do
 
02:31:25.349 --> 02:31:25.359 align:start position:0%
you follow up with the officers like do
 
02:31:28.950 --> 02:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
they have to do it in five years or
 
02:31:30.790 --> 02:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
how is it regulated
 
02:31:32.469 --> 02:31:32.479 align:start position:0%
thank you representative chase those are
 
02:31:35.349 --> 02:31:35.359 align:start position:0%
great questions so the the current uh
 
02:31:37.110 --> 02:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
grant was a three-year grant from the
 
02:31:39.030 --> 02:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
substance about substance abuse and
 
02:31:41.110 --> 02:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
mental health services administration it
 
02:31:43.750 --> 02:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
expires on september 30th
 
02:31:45.590 --> 02:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:31:49.750 --> 02:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
the training itself is 40 hours long
 
02:31:51.030 --> 02:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
and the
 
02:31:51.040 --> 02:31:52.870 align:start position:0%
and the
um

02:31:52.870 --> 02:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:56.389 --> 02:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
there is a recertification process
 
02:31:58.550 --> 02:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
that's an additional eight-hour training
 
02:32:00.469 --> 02:32:00.479 align:start position:0%
i think that that's once every three
 
02:32:00.479 --> 02:32:01.510 align:start position:0%
i think that that's once every three
years

02:32:01.510 --> 02:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:32:03.990 --> 02:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
but that could be a training in any area
 
02:32:06.150 --> 02:32:06.160 align:start position:0%
relative to mental health and training
 
02:32:07.830 --> 02:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
offered by
 
02:32:09.910 --> 02:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
police standards and training there was
 
02:32:12.070 --> 02:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
one other question in there i think that
 
02:32:16.230 --> 02:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:16.240 --> 02:32:17.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:32:17.510 --> 02:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:21.110 --> 02:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
i oh i just are the officers certified
 
02:32:23.349 --> 02:32:23.359 align:start position:0%
when they do that like if would you had
 
02:32:25.190 --> 02:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
more funds would you be able to do more
 
02:32:28.070 --> 02:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
than 25 or 30 officers at a time
 
02:32:32.070 --> 02:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
yeah the um so the the the training we
 
02:32:34.870 --> 02:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
had it the last formal live training we
 
02:32:37.270 --> 02:32:37.280 align:start position:0%
had prior to the pandemic actually ended
 
02:32:37.280 --> 02:32:38.630 align:start position:0%
had prior to the pandemic actually ended
on

02:32:38.630 --> 02:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:32:40.710 --> 02:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
march 13th which i think was the day
 
02:32:42.550 --> 02:32:42.560 align:start position:0%
that the president declared the state of
 
02:32:42.560 --> 02:32:44.309 align:start position:0%
that the president declared the state of
emergency

02:32:44.309 --> 02:32:44.319 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
02:32:47.110 --> 02:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
it was a training for 25 or 30. we had
 
02:32:49.590 --> 02:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
52 people in that training
 
02:32:51.910 --> 02:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
but the the challenge is that because of
 
02:32:54.950 --> 02:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
the intensive role model i'm role
 
02:32:57.429 --> 02:32:57.439 align:start position:0%
playing aspect to the training that we
 
02:32:59.429 --> 02:32:59.439 align:start position:0%
have to limit you know in terms of so
 
02:33:01.190 --> 02:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
that people are actually getting that
 
02:33:03.750 --> 02:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
first-hand practice in terms of role
 
02:33:06.550 --> 02:33:06.560 align:start position:0%
modeling but um we've been offering it
 
02:33:09.110 --> 02:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
um about three times a year we have
 
02:33:10.790 --> 02:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
offered it a couple times since the
 
02:33:13.110 --> 02:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
pandemic socially distanced
 
02:33:15.110 --> 02:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
um and we are going to be offering it
 
02:33:17.750 --> 02:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
again in hopefully in june july and
 
02:33:20.630 --> 02:33:20.640 align:start position:0%
august of this year one of the other
 
02:33:22.950 --> 02:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
challenges with that is that um you know
 
02:33:25.910 --> 02:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
with 20 different faculty members it's
 
02:33:28.070 --> 02:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
it places a significant burden on them
 
02:33:30.469 --> 02:33:30.479 align:start position:0%
many of them are volunteers but
 
02:33:33.349 --> 02:33:33.359 align:start position:0%
but we do rely on their expertise
 
02:33:36.710 --> 02:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
okay follow up yes you may
 
02:33:39.990 --> 02:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm sorry so um
 
02:33:42.710 --> 02:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:45.670 --> 02:33:45.680 align:start position:0%
is this going to be become a requirement
 
02:33:47.510 --> 02:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
for officers in
 
02:33:50.070 --> 02:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
every town or is this just going to be
 
02:33:52.950 --> 02:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
something that is a volunteer
 
02:33:55.270 --> 02:33:55.280 align:start position:0%
and do you have also is there follow-up
 
02:33:58.550 --> 02:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
training or help for the officers as far
 
02:33:58.560 --> 02:34:01.590 align:start position:0%
training or help for the officers as far
as

02:34:01.590 --> 02:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:03.750 --> 02:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
psychologically you know if they're in
 
02:34:06.469 --> 02:34:06.479 align:start position:0%
distress themselves with this
 
02:34:08.070 --> 02:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
yes again thank you those are great
 
02:34:10.550 --> 02:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
questions um no we
 
02:34:12.710 --> 02:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
while it was recommended in the in the
 
02:34:14.870 --> 02:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
president's 21st century
 
02:34:14.880 --> 02:34:15.750 align:start position:0%
president's 21st century
um

02:34:15.750 --> 02:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:17.510 --> 02:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
policing report that it does be a
 
02:34:19.270 --> 02:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
requirement we are not making it a
 
02:34:21.429 --> 02:34:21.439 align:start position:0%
requirement but we definitely want to
 
02:34:21.439 --> 02:34:22.550 align:start position:0%
requirement but we definitely want to
increase

02:34:22.550 --> 02:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
increase
 
02:34:24.550 --> 02:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
the availability of the number of
 
02:34:26.070 --> 02:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
officers in new hampshire that are
 
02:34:26.080 --> 02:34:27.030 align:start position:0%
officers in new hampshire that are
trained

02:34:27.030 --> 02:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
trained
 
02:34:29.110 --> 02:34:29.120 align:start position:0%
there are some departments that have uh
 
02:34:31.270 --> 02:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
that have um offered it from time to
 
02:34:33.190 --> 02:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
time on their own but it's been very
 
02:34:33.200 --> 02:34:34.630 align:start position:0%
time on their own but it's been very
inconsistent

02:34:34.630 --> 02:34:34.640 align:start position:0%
inconsistent
 
02:34:36.389 --> 02:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
um and this would make it more
 
02:34:39.750 --> 02:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
consistent and relative to the um
 
02:34:42.309 --> 02:34:42.319 align:start position:0%
wellness of police officers there's been
 
02:34:44.550 --> 02:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
a great deal of activity
 
02:34:47.670 --> 02:34:47.680 align:start position:0%
that's that's occurred relative to that
 
02:34:50.230 --> 02:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
most notably through state police and
 
02:34:53.750 --> 02:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
their standing up a peer support program
 
02:34:55.190 --> 02:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
where they train
 
02:34:57.270 --> 02:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officers to serve as
 
02:34:59.750 --> 02:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
peers to each other
 
02:35:01.670 --> 02:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
to assist so that people know who they
 
02:35:04.389 --> 02:35:04.399 align:start position:0%
can go to uh chief goldstein had also
 
02:35:05.990 --> 02:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned the granite state critical
 
02:35:07.830 --> 02:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
incident stress debriefing team which
 
02:35:10.469 --> 02:35:10.479 align:start position:0%
has been around for a while which which
 
02:35:13.510 --> 02:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
provides supports and certainly there is
 
02:35:16.150 --> 02:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
um you know employee assistance programs
 
02:35:17.830 --> 02:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
that are offered through
 
02:35:19.910 --> 02:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
through most departments i think the
 
02:35:21.910 --> 02:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
bigger challenge with this is changing
 
02:35:25.110 --> 02:35:25.120 align:start position:0%
the culture around um for our first
 
02:35:28.309 --> 02:35:28.319 align:start position:0%
responders to that they recognize that
 
02:35:31.030 --> 02:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
their own personal needs for maintaining
 
02:35:32.389 --> 02:35:32.399 align:start position:0%
their mental health and their
 
02:35:35.270 --> 02:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
vulnerabilities and their willingness to
 
02:35:38.230 --> 02:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
uh to seek help and recognize um and
 
02:35:40.790 --> 02:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
support each other in doing that
 
02:35:43.110 --> 02:35:43.120 align:start position:0%
terrific thank you very much
 
02:35:45.429 --> 02:35:45.439 align:start position:0%
representative silvia
 
02:35:46.790 --> 02:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
02:35:51.110 --> 02:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question mr norton um
 
02:35:52.710 --> 02:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
i may have missed something along the
 
02:35:55.349 --> 02:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
way but so forgive me if i i'm asking
 
02:35:57.910 --> 02:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
something that's already been spoken of
 
02:35:57.920 --> 02:35:59.030 align:start position:0%
something that's already been spoken of
um

02:35:59.030 --> 02:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:01.030 --> 02:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
you talk about uh
 
02:36:02.790 --> 02:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
your training and
 
02:36:04.230 --> 02:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
is this a separate
 
02:36:04.240 --> 02:36:05.270 align:start position:0%
is this a separate
um

02:36:05.270 --> 02:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:08.389 --> 02:36:08.399 align:start position:0%
instruction from the standard police
 
02:36:08.399 --> 02:36:10.550 align:start position:0%
instruction from the standard police
training

02:36:10.550 --> 02:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
training
 
02:36:12.550 --> 02:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for your question
 
02:36:12.560 --> 02:36:13.910 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for your question
currently

02:36:13.910 --> 02:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
currently
 
02:36:17.030 --> 02:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
police officers going through the
 
02:36:20.550 --> 02:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
the academy receive
 
02:36:22.710 --> 02:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
i think it's 500
 
02:36:25.590 --> 02:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
odd hours of instructional training of
 
02:36:29.349 --> 02:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
that 16 hours of it are in uh in mental
 
02:36:32.389 --> 02:36:32.399 align:start position:0%
health um but those numbers have changed
 
02:36:34.710 --> 02:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
quite a bit over the years so
 
02:36:36.630 --> 02:36:36.640 align:start position:0%
for instance and i'm just i'm taking a
 
02:36:39.110 --> 02:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
guess because uh over 40 years it's a
 
02:36:41.429 --> 02:36:41.439 align:start position:0%
bit of a blur but let's say 20 years ago
 
02:36:43.349 --> 02:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
that requirement was four hours of
 
02:36:45.110 --> 02:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
mental health training
 
02:36:48.790 --> 02:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
and then uh somewhere in there that um
 
02:36:51.190 --> 02:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
you know maybe 12 years ago that changed
 
02:36:54.150 --> 02:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
to a doubled up to eight hours of
 
02:36:56.870 --> 02:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
officers going through the academy um
 
02:36:59.110 --> 02:36:59.120 align:start position:0%
and then a few years back maybe six
 
02:37:02.389 --> 02:37:02.399 align:start position:0%
years ago it doubled up to 16. so that
 
02:37:04.630 --> 02:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
means some of those some of our older
 
02:37:07.190 --> 02:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
officers have only had four hours of
 
02:37:09.830 --> 02:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
mental health training um unless they've
 
02:37:12.070 --> 02:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
sought it out before so this would be an
 
02:37:13.750 --> 02:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
02:37:16.469 --> 02:37:16.479 align:start position:0%
um to increase the the base both for you
 
02:37:19.110 --> 02:37:19.120 align:start position:0%
know for newer officers but for older
 
02:37:22.790 --> 02:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
officers uh in the field as well
 
02:37:24.870 --> 02:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
so if i can follow up mr chairman you
 
02:37:24.880 --> 02:37:25.750 align:start position:0%
so if i can follow up mr chairman you
can

02:37:25.750 --> 02:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:37:27.830 --> 02:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:37:30.150 --> 02:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
i guess part of what i'm trying to get
 
02:37:32.790 --> 02:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
clear is is this part of the academy or
 
02:37:35.510 --> 02:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
is this a training that's done by nami
 
02:37:38.230 --> 02:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
or some other group
 
02:37:40.150 --> 02:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
thanks for your question the the bill is
 
02:37:42.309 --> 02:37:42.319 align:start position:0%
written so that the funding would go to
 
02:37:43.670 --> 02:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
the academy
 
02:37:45.670 --> 02:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
and the academy
 
02:37:47.030 --> 02:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
could then
 
02:37:49.510 --> 02:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
contract for that
 
02:37:50.790 --> 02:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
training or they could provide it
 
02:37:52.870 --> 02:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
themselves currently under the current
 
02:37:54.790 --> 02:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
grant nami
 
02:37:56.710 --> 02:37:56.720 align:start position:0%
wrote the grant and is providing the
 
02:37:56.720 --> 02:37:58.230 align:start position:0%
wrote the grant and is providing the
training

02:37:58.230 --> 02:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
training
 
02:37:59.990 --> 02:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
but the bill is written so that it would
 
02:38:04.630 --> 02:38:04.640 align:start position:0%
go to the academy and while obviously as
 
02:38:06.710 --> 02:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh as a representative of nami i would
 
02:38:08.630 --> 02:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
hope that we would have the opportunity
 
02:38:08.640 --> 02:38:09.510 align:start position:0%
hope that we would have the opportunity
to

02:38:09.510 --> 02:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:38:11.910 --> 02:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh to provide that training our goal is
 
02:38:13.750 --> 02:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
to really ensure that this training
 
02:38:15.510 --> 02:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
continues in the state
 
02:38:18.070 --> 02:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
um whoever is providing it
 
02:38:19.429 --> 02:38:19.439 align:start position:0%
thank you and one more follow-up mr
 
02:38:21.830 --> 02:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
chairman sure certainly
 
02:38:24.870 --> 02:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
so as far as adami
 
02:38:26.950 --> 02:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
doing training um
 
02:38:29.990 --> 02:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
how familiar are you with the rest of
 
02:38:32.230 --> 02:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
the training that uh cadets get in the
 
02:38:35.429 --> 02:38:35.439 align:start position:0%
academy uh i i guess i'm trying to
 
02:38:37.670 --> 02:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
to determine if there are conflicting
 
02:38:40.230 --> 02:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
things taught on one side of the program
 
02:38:43.590 --> 02:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
and then another uh is there is there a
 
02:38:46.389 --> 02:38:46.399 align:start position:0%
prob any problem with um cross-training
 
02:38:46.399 --> 02:38:47.349 align:start position:0%
prob any problem with um cross-training
or

02:38:47.349 --> 02:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:38:49.750 --> 02:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
conflicting training
 
02:38:51.349 --> 02:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry representative sylvia i
 
02:38:52.870 --> 02:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
couldn't quite hear the last part of
 
02:38:54.950 --> 02:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
your sentence
 
02:38:57.910 --> 02:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to determine whether there is
 
02:39:01.910 --> 02:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
an issue with uh training that
 
02:39:03.990 --> 02:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
is the normal part of the academy that
 
02:39:06.710 --> 02:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
might be in conflict with what training
 
02:39:09.429 --> 02:39:09.439 align:start position:0%
you or nami or the mental health side of
 
02:39:12.150 --> 02:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
things would be teaching
 
02:39:14.309 --> 02:39:14.319 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your question i mean i
 
02:39:15.910 --> 02:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
i don't want to speak for director
 
02:39:17.750 --> 02:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
skipper and the academy but i will
 
02:39:19.270 --> 02:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
certainly say that he's been very
 
02:39:21.910 --> 02:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
supportive of the training that
 
02:39:24.469 --> 02:39:24.479 align:start position:0%
that nami does and has been supportive
 
02:39:25.910 --> 02:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
of this uh
 
02:39:29.349 --> 02:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
this effort to uh move uh this part of
 
02:39:31.670 --> 02:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
senate bill 134 forward and he's been
 
02:39:33.429 --> 02:39:33.439 align:start position:0%
involved in the conversations that we've
 
02:39:36.150 --> 02:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
had uh relative to this and he's very
 
02:39:38.150 --> 02:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
familiar with um with crisis
 
02:39:40.230 --> 02:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
intervention team training and i will
 
02:39:41.750 --> 02:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
just say that we
 
02:39:44.309 --> 02:39:44.319 align:start position:0%
that we are not calling it um crisis
 
02:39:46.150 --> 02:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
intervention team training in this build
 
02:39:48.469 --> 02:39:48.479 align:start position:0%
just for proprietary reasons
 
02:39:50.469 --> 02:39:50.479 align:start position:0%
so uh this came out of some of the
 
02:39:53.590 --> 02:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
conversations that we had with uh then
 
02:39:55.670 --> 02:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
attorney general mcdonald the suggestion
 
02:39:57.910 --> 02:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
was that we just call it mental health
 
02:39:59.590 --> 02:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
intervention training
 
02:40:01.830 --> 02:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:40:03.590 --> 02:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan
 
02:40:06.230 --> 02:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
um yes thank you very much mr chair this
 
02:40:07.990 --> 02:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
is some
 
02:40:11.110 --> 02:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
this part exists in addition to the uh
 
02:40:13.269 --> 02:40:13.279 align:start position:0%
budget bills which are wending their way
 
02:40:16.150 --> 02:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
to the senate so what is the uh
 
02:40:18.790 --> 02:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
significance of the fact that we're
 
02:40:20.950 --> 02:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
having this in addition to
 
02:40:23.110 --> 02:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
whatever is appropriate in the budget to
 
02:40:24.389 --> 02:40:24.399 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:40:27.030 --> 02:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
for uh for these programs aside from i
 
02:40:27.040 --> 02:40:27.830 align:start position:0%
for uh for these programs aside from i
guess

02:40:27.830 --> 02:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
guess
 
02:40:30.150 --> 02:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
extra money turns up uh the fiscal
 
02:40:36.030 --> 02:40:36.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:38.150 --> 02:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
authorization of having this in addition
 
02:40:40.870 --> 02:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:42.870 --> 02:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question um
 
02:40:44.710 --> 02:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
representative horgan
 
02:40:47.110 --> 02:40:47.120 align:start position:0%
um i'm not really clear i will just say
 
02:40:48.950 --> 02:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
that when we had conversations with the
 
02:40:50.950 --> 02:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
governor's office that the governor's
 
02:40:50.960 --> 02:40:51.910 align:start position:0%
governor's office that the governor's
office

02:40:51.910 --> 02:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
office
 
02:40:54.469 --> 02:40:54.479 align:start position:0%
suggested that we
 
02:40:57.269 --> 02:40:57.279 align:start position:0%
put it forward as a separate bill
 
02:40:57.279 --> 02:40:58.070 align:start position:0%
put it forward as a separate bill
and

02:40:58.070 --> 02:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:40:59.910 --> 02:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
i believe that the governor also did
 
02:41:01.429 --> 02:41:01.439 align:start position:0%
include it in
 
02:41:04.070 --> 02:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
in his budget
 
02:41:06.150 --> 02:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
okay thanks
 
02:41:10.550 --> 02:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:12.230 --> 02:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
hello thank you mr chairman and thank
 
02:41:15.750 --> 02:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question mr norton um
 
02:41:17.910 --> 02:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
i hope that i didn't miss this earlier
 
02:41:20.389 --> 02:41:20.399 align:start position:0%
but i was just wondering if this if this
 
02:41:22.950 --> 02:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
funding would open up um the possibility
 
02:41:25.670 --> 02:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
of matching grants to from the federal
 
02:41:28.469 --> 02:41:28.479 align:start position:0%
um department of justice for training in
 
02:41:31.670 --> 02:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
mental health interventions
 
02:41:33.269 --> 02:41:33.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question we are
 
02:41:36.870 --> 02:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
always monitoring um the possibility of
 
02:41:40.550 --> 02:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
of additional training and applying for
 
02:41:42.389 --> 02:41:42.399 align:start position:0%
uh for those types of grants when they
 
02:41:44.790 --> 02:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
become available
 
02:41:44.800 --> 02:41:45.910 align:start position:0%
become available
and

02:41:45.910 --> 02:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:41:47.510 --> 02:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i suppose you know i mean it would
 
02:41:50.230 --> 02:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
depend on the on the type of grant
 
02:41:51.990 --> 02:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of whether it could be matching
 
02:41:57.190 --> 02:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:58.950 --> 02:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
all set
 
02:42:03.429 --> 02:42:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:05.590 --> 02:42:05.600 align:start position:0%
see none thank you very much for your
 
02:42:07.030 --> 02:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
testimony today
 
02:42:09.830 --> 02:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:22.870 --> 02:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:24.550 --> 02:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
hello good morning mr chair and members
 
02:42:26.469 --> 02:42:26.479 align:start position:0%
of the committee good morning

my name is marie mullen i'm the director
 
02:42:29.830 --> 02:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
of finance at the department of
 
02:42:29.840 --> 02:42:31.269 align:start position:0%
of finance at the department of
transportation

02:42:31.269 --> 02:42:31.279 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
02:42:34.389 --> 02:42:34.399 align:start position:0%
and i'm here to in support of part four
 
02:42:36.630 --> 02:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
of the bill relative to civil liability
 
02:42:39.429 --> 02:42:39.439 align:start position:0%
and damage to the highways
 
02:42:42.469 --> 02:42:42.479 align:start position:0%
assistant attorney general zachary toll
 
02:42:45.190 --> 02:42:45.200 align:start position:0%
testified a short time ago
 
02:42:45.200 --> 02:42:46.070 align:start position:0%
testified a short time ago
and

02:42:46.070 --> 02:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:42:48.630 --> 02:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
i wanted to just clarify the department
 
02:42:50.389 --> 02:42:50.399 align:start position:0%
had wanted to
 
02:42:52.309 --> 02:42:52.319 align:start position:0%
bring this forward
 
02:42:54.469 --> 02:42:54.479 align:start position:0%
because of concerns raised by the ag's
 
02:42:54.479 --> 02:42:55.910 align:start position:0%
because of concerns raised by the ag's
office

02:42:55.910 --> 02:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
office
 
02:42:57.910 --> 02:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
questioning whether we are authorized to
 
02:43:00.469 --> 02:43:00.479 align:start position:0%
use estimated costs for pending damage
 
02:43:02.070 --> 02:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
damage claims
 
02:43:04.230 --> 02:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
without authorization to use estimated
 
02:43:06.309 --> 02:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
costs the like the state will likely
 
02:43:08.790 --> 02:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
fail to collect thousands of damages
 
02:43:11.030 --> 02:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
owed to the state
 
02:43:13.269 --> 02:43:13.279 align:start position:0%
this provision would allow d.o.t to use
 
02:43:15.030 --> 02:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
estimates or actual costs for
 
02:43:17.349 --> 02:43:17.359 align:start position:0%
reimbursement of the damage
 
02:43:19.429 --> 02:43:19.439 align:start position:0%
the department uses estimated costs and
 
02:43:22.070 --> 02:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
many damage claims as the actual costs
 
02:43:23.349 --> 02:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
are not known
 
02:43:24.790 --> 02:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
for the work
 
02:43:27.030 --> 02:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
to be performed and there can be many
 
02:43:29.510 --> 02:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
reasons for this one of those is winter
 
02:43:31.349 --> 02:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
much of this damage can occur during the
 
02:43:31.359 --> 02:43:32.950 align:start position:0%
much of this damage can occur during the
winter

02:43:32.950 --> 02:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
winter
 
02:43:34.550 --> 02:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
we cannot make
 
02:43:36.469 --> 02:43:36.479 align:start position:0%
those repairs during winter the ground's
 
02:43:38.070 --> 02:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
frozen you may have
 
02:43:40.389 --> 02:43:40.399 align:start position:0%
snow banks along the side of the road so
 
02:43:42.309 --> 02:43:42.319 align:start position:0%
we there may be a time before we can
 
02:43:43.429 --> 02:43:43.439 align:start position:0%
make those
 
02:43:45.269 --> 02:43:45.279 align:start position:0%
um repairs and we'll know what the
 
02:43:47.590 --> 02:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
actual costs are
 
02:43:49.030 --> 02:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
and the same thing with timing of
 
02:43:51.590 --> 02:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
projects and so if the department waits
 
02:43:54.469 --> 02:43:54.479 align:start position:0%
until it has actual costs the statute of
 
02:43:57.190 --> 02:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
limitations may expire in many cases and
 
02:43:58.870 --> 02:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be able to collect for the
 
02:44:01.830 --> 02:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
damage that has occurred
 
02:44:03.830 --> 02:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
the amendment that senator carson
 
02:44:07.590 --> 02:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
referenced to pursue pending claims
 
02:44:09.429 --> 02:44:09.439 align:start position:0%
those have been on hold for the past
 
02:44:11.670 --> 02:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
year year and a half
 
02:44:13.590 --> 02:44:13.600 align:start position:0%
we have not been
 
02:44:15.190 --> 02:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
submitting claims to the attorney
 
02:44:16.950 --> 02:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
general's office that we have been able
 
02:44:18.790 --> 02:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
unable to collect on because we are
 
02:44:20.790 --> 02:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
using estimates
 
02:44:23.750 --> 02:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
and we do not and it was under the we
 
02:44:25.110 --> 02:44:25.120 align:start position:0%
are under the impression that we will
 
02:44:27.349 --> 02:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
not be able to pursue those unless we
 
02:44:29.750 --> 02:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
have actual costs so we have not been
 
02:44:33.110 --> 02:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
providing these pending live liabilities
 
02:44:36.389 --> 02:44:36.399 align:start position:0%
to the to the ag's office to collect on
 
02:44:38.230 --> 02:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
so without this cemented language we
 
02:44:40.150 --> 02:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to pursue you know
 
02:44:41.590 --> 02:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
several hundred thousand dollars of
 
02:44:45.190 --> 02:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
claims to for damage to state property
 
02:44:47.349 --> 02:44:47.359 align:start position:0%
um so the inclusion of these pending
 
02:44:50.469 --> 02:44:50.479 align:start position:0%
claims is not creating liability but
 
02:44:50.479 --> 02:44:51.429 align:start position:0%
claims is not creating liability but
it's

02:44:51.429 --> 02:44:51.439 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:44:54.389 --> 02:44:54.399 align:start position:0%
allowing us to use estimates
 
02:44:56.070 --> 02:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
for these claims where people have
 
02:44:58.710 --> 02:44:58.720 align:start position:0%
determined to be liable already
 
02:45:01.590 --> 02:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
um and there were some questions earlier
 
02:45:04.070 --> 02:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
about funding in the budget
 
02:45:06.150 --> 02:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
the funding for these repairs is not in
 
02:45:08.469 --> 02:45:08.479 align:start position:0%
our budget we rely on the revenue we
 
02:45:09.750 --> 02:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
bring in to be able to make these
 
02:45:09.760 --> 02:45:11.750 align:start position:0%
bring in to be able to make these
repairs

02:45:11.750 --> 02:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
repairs
 
02:45:11.760 --> 02:45:12.710 align:start position:0%
repairs
and

02:45:12.710 --> 02:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:45:14.790 --> 02:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
you know when dot personnel have to make
 
02:45:17.190 --> 02:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
these repairs they are taken away from
 
02:45:19.910 --> 02:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
other duties and projects um to work on
 
02:45:22.309 --> 02:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
these these type of items
 
02:45:24.070 --> 02:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
um and i know there were some other
 
02:45:26.230 --> 02:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
questions uh related to whether
 
02:45:28.870 --> 02:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
insurance covers this and the answer is
 
02:45:31.269 --> 02:45:31.279 align:start position:0%
yes it is damage to property and is
 
02:45:33.990 --> 02:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
included on folks insurance claims
 
02:45:35.349 --> 02:45:35.359 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:45:40.630 --> 02:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:42.630 --> 02:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
damage claims that came through the
 
02:45:44.469 --> 02:45:44.479 align:start position:0%
department for damage to the highways
 
02:45:45.990 --> 02:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
around the state
 
02:45:50.230 --> 02:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
about 157 or 73 percent had insurance
 
02:45:53.030 --> 02:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
and 58 or 27 percent did not have
 
02:45:54.469 --> 02:45:54.479 align:start position:0%
insurance so
 
02:45:57.110 --> 02:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
just as a representation there and i
 
02:45:59.510 --> 02:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
know there were questions about um you
 
02:46:01.510 --> 02:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
know the costs and the majority the
 
02:46:03.269 --> 02:46:03.279 align:start position:0%
majority of the claims in that year
 
02:46:05.830 --> 02:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
about 67 were less than three thousand
 
02:46:05.840 --> 02:46:06.870 align:start position:0%
about 67 were less than three thousand
dollars

02:46:06.870 --> 02:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:46:09.030 --> 02:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
and 40 to 41 percent were less than a
 
02:46:10.630 --> 02:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars so
 
02:46:12.870 --> 02:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
these are not huge claims we don't you
 
02:46:15.030 --> 02:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
know we aren't trying to get uh the
 
02:46:17.190 --> 02:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
money back for the full guard rail as
 
02:46:20.150 --> 02:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
attorney general um toll was discussing
 
02:46:22.309 --> 02:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
we will look at only the section that is
 
02:46:24.469 --> 02:46:24.479 align:start position:0%
damaged and
 
02:46:26.550 --> 02:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
you know our billing for
 
02:46:29.269 --> 02:46:29.279 align:start position:0%
time labor and materials
 
02:46:33.349 --> 02:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
for that to repair that damage
 
02:46:35.030 --> 02:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to thank you for your
 
02:46:36.469 --> 02:46:36.479 align:start position:0%
consideration and i'll i'm happy to
 
02:46:38.710 --> 02:46:38.720 align:start position:0%
answer any questions regarding this this
 
02:46:40.070 --> 02:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
bill and amendment
 
02:46:43.030 --> 02:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan
 
02:46:44.550 --> 02:46:44.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair thank you
 
02:46:46.710 --> 02:46:46.720 align:start position:0%
very much mrs mullen
 
02:46:49.750 --> 02:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
and actually i apologize i asked a
 
02:46:51.990 --> 02:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
question of the ag's office which was
 
02:46:54.070 --> 02:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
about depreciation and i see now that
 
02:46:55.910 --> 02:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
flatly says
 
02:46:57.670 --> 02:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
such costs shall not be reduced for
 
02:47:00.309 --> 02:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
depreciation so
 
02:47:02.630 --> 02:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
why is it uh why is it done that way
 
02:47:04.870 --> 02:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
since um none of these
 
02:47:06.550 --> 02:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
pictures on the side of the highway last
 
02:47:08.630 --> 02:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
forever you have a
 
02:47:10.070 --> 02:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
scheduled uh
 
02:47:12.389 --> 02:47:12.399 align:start position:0%
you replace them every so often uh often
 
02:47:14.950 --> 02:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
anyway so like why
 
02:47:16.150 --> 02:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
02:47:18.389 --> 02:47:18.399 align:start position:0%
why if somebody say destroys a section
 
02:47:20.630 --> 02:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
of guardrail that say was like 19 years
 
02:47:22.469 --> 02:47:22.479 align:start position:0%
old and going to be placed in here why
 
02:47:24.230 --> 02:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
are they paying for 100 of the
 
02:47:26.630 --> 02:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
replacement costs instead of uh
 
02:47:28.710 --> 02:47:28.720 align:start position:0%
five percent since it would have
 
02:47:31.510 --> 02:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
theoretically had been replaced uh
 
02:47:34.630 --> 02:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
a year later even nobody had had
 
02:47:36.150 --> 02:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
destroyed it so
 
02:47:37.190 --> 02:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:47:38.309 --> 02:47:38.319 align:start position:0%
and you ever run the problems with
 
02:47:40.550 --> 02:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
insurance companies when you
 
02:47:42.150 --> 02:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
try to uh
 
02:47:43.990 --> 02:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
try to and would you ever run the props
 
02:47:45.590 --> 02:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
insurance companies if you try to
 
02:47:46.870 --> 02:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
replace that
 
02:47:53.030 --> 02:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:54.950 --> 02:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
yeah the the law
 
02:47:57.510 --> 02:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
previously to to this request has said
 
02:47:59.910 --> 02:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
that includes replacement costs of
 
02:48:02.630 --> 02:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
productive barriers when maintained and
 
02:48:05.269 --> 02:48:05.279 align:start position:0%
blah blah so it is always said that we
 
02:48:08.309 --> 02:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
could do replacement costs um and
 
02:48:10.550 --> 02:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
understandably these assets last a long
 
02:48:11.830 --> 02:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
time so
 
02:48:13.990 --> 02:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
um you know generally they're they're
 
02:48:16.389 --> 02:48:16.399 align:start position:0%
hit quite frequently so
 
02:48:18.389 --> 02:48:18.399 align:start position:0%
generally the depreciation
 
02:48:20.790 --> 02:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
it hasn't really gone to that level yet
 
02:48:22.870 --> 02:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
we're not at 20 or 30 or 40 years some
 
02:48:24.710 --> 02:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
of these assets can last
 
02:48:26.790 --> 02:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
40 50 years
 
02:48:28.630 --> 02:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
so we're not really
 
02:48:30.790 --> 02:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
depreciating that but we need to factor
 
02:48:32.950 --> 02:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
in the replacement costs to the highway
 
02:48:34.870 --> 02:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
highway system uh the highway and
 
02:48:36.230 --> 02:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
turnpike funds
 
02:48:38.070 --> 02:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh the highway fund is
 
02:48:39.990 --> 02:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
not very uh
 
02:48:41.670 --> 02:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
liquid at
 
02:48:43.830 --> 02:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
at this time and so to be able to
 
02:48:46.150 --> 02:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
recover the cost to replace and repair
 
02:48:46.160 --> 02:48:47.030 align:start position:0%
recover the cost to replace and repair
those

02:48:47.030 --> 02:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:48:49.750 --> 02:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
vital safety um you know whether it's
 
02:48:51.670 --> 02:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
guardrail whether it's lighting we have
 
02:48:53.030 --> 02:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
light posts that are hitting knocked
 
02:48:53.040 --> 02:48:53.910 align:start position:0%
light posts that are hitting knocked
over

02:48:53.910 --> 02:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
over
 
02:48:55.990 --> 02:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
signs those are all
 
02:48:57.510 --> 02:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
vital safety
 
02:49:00.230 --> 02:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
components of the highway system that
 
02:49:02.790 --> 02:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
need to be replaced to ensure the safety
 
02:49:06.469 --> 02:49:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:08.150 --> 02:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
okay thanks
 
02:49:10.870 --> 02:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
representative macbeth
 
02:49:13.030 --> 02:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you miss
 
02:49:13.040 --> 02:49:13.990 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you miss
mullen

02:49:13.990 --> 02:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
mullen
 
02:49:16.550 --> 02:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
um i'm wondering i
 
02:49:18.150 --> 02:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
previously read there have been some
 
02:49:19.990 --> 02:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
questions regarding what states other
 
02:49:22.630 --> 02:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
states perhaps um have this liability
 
02:49:25.349 --> 02:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
and i've found two that do do
 
02:49:27.830 --> 02:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
but they also limit the liability the
 
02:49:30.309 --> 02:49:30.319 align:start position:0%
civil liability to um whether it was
 
02:49:32.950 --> 02:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
negligence on the drivers or illegal
 
02:49:34.950 --> 02:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
operations say an overweight truck or
 
02:49:36.309 --> 02:49:36.319 align:start position:0%
the damage was done by something like
 
02:49:36.319 --> 02:49:37.349 align:start position:0%
the damage was done by something like
that

02:49:37.349 --> 02:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:49:39.750 --> 02:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire are is is the previous
 
02:49:41.990 --> 02:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
law is the current law or does this law
 
02:49:43.830 --> 02:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
change or
 
02:49:45.910 --> 02:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
how does it define who is liable is
 
02:49:48.550 --> 02:49:48.560 align:start position:0%
strict liability everybody regardless of
 
02:49:51.750 --> 02:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
whether it was an accident
 
02:49:54.070 --> 02:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
um i would defer to the attorney
 
02:49:56.469 --> 02:49:56.479 align:start position:0%
general's office on that question i'm
 
02:49:59.349 --> 02:49:59.359 align:start position:0%
sorry i'm not i am not um
 
02:50:03.349 --> 02:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
you know familiar with the legal um
 
02:50:06.150 --> 02:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
interpretation of these items um i do
 
02:50:07.269 --> 02:50:07.279 align:start position:0%
know that
 
02:50:09.030 --> 02:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
um you know we
 
02:50:10.950 --> 02:50:10.960 align:start position:0%
to determine the liability we do have
 
02:50:12.870 --> 02:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
police reports we we get the police
 
02:50:14.309 --> 02:50:14.319 align:start position:0%
reports we
 
02:50:14.319 --> 02:50:15.510 align:start position:0%
reports we
identify

02:50:15.510 --> 02:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
identify
 
02:50:17.590 --> 02:50:17.600 align:start position:0%
that information before we determine any
 
02:50:20.550 --> 02:50:20.560 align:start position:0%
the person that's liable for the damage
 
02:50:22.630 --> 02:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
but i'm not
 
02:50:24.070 --> 02:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
you know can't really speak to the
 
02:50:26.070 --> 02:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
strict liability versus
 
02:50:27.830 --> 02:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
other requirements
 
02:50:29.590 --> 02:50:29.600 align:start position:0%
thank you you're correct my my question
 
02:50:33.510 --> 02:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:37.510 --> 02:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
any other questions for miss mullen
 
02:50:38.389 --> 02:50:38.399 align:start position:0%
i i
 
02:50:39.510 --> 02:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
i just
 
02:50:42.309 --> 02:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
i asked the question earlier tonight uh
 
02:50:43.830 --> 02:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
02:50:45.910 --> 02:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
my understanding was that this was in
 
02:50:49.269 --> 02:50:49.279 align:start position:0%
the budget or in the budget bills at one
 
02:50:51.429 --> 02:50:51.439 align:start position:0%
point in time or asked to be amended to
 
02:50:52.710 --> 02:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
02:50:55.110 --> 02:50:55.120 align:start position:0%
process but wasn't amended is that
 
02:50:55.120 --> 02:50:56.630 align:start position:0%
process but wasn't amended is that
correct

02:50:56.630 --> 02:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:50:58.710 --> 02:50:58.720 align:start position:0%
um that's correct we have it in house
 
02:51:00.550 --> 02:51:00.560 align:start position:0%
bill 2 in the budget bill
 
02:51:03.190 --> 02:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
and i believe representative umberger
 
02:51:05.429 --> 02:51:05.439 align:start position:0%
had contacted
 
02:51:08.070 --> 02:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
your committee or yourself for input
 
02:51:10.550 --> 02:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
into that and i think based on your
 
02:51:12.630 --> 02:51:12.640 align:start position:0%
your the committee's recommendation they
 
02:51:15.990 --> 02:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
removed the section on the retrospective
 
02:51:18.230 --> 02:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
and that's why we wanted to come to you
 
02:51:19.830 --> 02:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
here and explain
 
02:51:22.710 --> 02:51:22.720 align:start position:0%
uh you know the the purpose of it and
 
02:51:24.950 --> 02:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
that you know we weren't adding people
 
02:51:27.590 --> 02:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
who are liable that we're just trying to
 
02:51:29.590 --> 02:51:29.600 align:start position:0%
it's related to the estimated versus
 
02:51:31.990 --> 02:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
actual cost so these folks have already
 
02:51:34.070 --> 02:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
been determined to be liable
 
02:51:37.349 --> 02:51:37.359 align:start position:0%
but if we can't use estimated costs then
 
02:51:39.590 --> 02:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
we will not be able to collect anything
 
02:51:41.830 --> 02:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
from these folks for the damage that has
 
02:51:41.840 --> 02:51:42.870 align:start position:0%
from these folks for the damage that has
occurred

02:51:42.870 --> 02:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
occurred
 
02:51:42.880 --> 02:51:43.750 align:start position:0%
occurred
so

02:51:43.750 --> 02:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:51:44.870 --> 02:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
you know we're not trying to create
 
02:51:46.550 --> 02:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
additional liability so we wanted to
 
02:51:49.190 --> 02:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
come here and explain it with with a
 
02:51:51.750 --> 02:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
potential amendment here
 
02:51:54.630 --> 02:51:54.640 align:start position:0%
so just so i understand it's already in
 
02:51:57.269 --> 02:51:57.279 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 with the exception of the
 
02:51:59.670 --> 02:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
part making it retroactive
 
02:52:01.269 --> 02:52:01.279 align:start position:0%
that is correct
 
02:52:01.279 --> 02:52:02.950 align:start position:0%
that is correct
and

02:52:02.950 --> 02:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:52:05.590 --> 02:52:05.600 align:start position:0%
and in terms of making it retroactive
 
02:52:08.710 --> 02:52:08.720 align:start position:0%
the you'll be able to use the estimates
 
02:52:11.910 --> 02:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
in the future just not on the
 
02:52:16.309 --> 02:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
pending cases that's correct
 
02:52:17.830 --> 02:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:52:19.110 --> 02:52:19.120 align:start position:0%

02:53:07.670 --> 02:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
of structured settlements uh i've been
 
02:53:07.680 --> 02:53:08.550 align:start position:0%
of structured settlements uh i've been
for

02:53:08.550 --> 02:53:08.560 align:start position:0%

15 years and i also am speaking on
 
02:53:13.830 --> 02:53:13.840 align:start position:0%
behalf of the national instruction
 
02:53:16.070 --> 02:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
settlements trade association which i
 
02:53:18.469 --> 02:53:18.479 align:start position:0%
sit on the board of directors
 
02:53:20.550 --> 02:53:20.560 align:start position:0%
as you may know structured settlements
 
02:53:21.910 --> 02:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
help provide
 
02:53:21.920 --> 02:53:23.110 align:start position:0%
help provide
people

02:53:23.110 --> 02:53:23.120 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:53:25.429 --> 02:53:25.439 align:start position:0%
financial recovery after a loss with
 
02:53:28.710 --> 02:53:28.720 align:start position:0%
secure guaranteed tax-free income
 
02:53:30.870 --> 02:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
and we are aware that circumstances
 
02:53:32.469 --> 02:53:32.479 align:start position:0%
change in people's lives and there may
 
02:53:34.710 --> 02:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
be a need for them to
 
02:53:37.830 --> 02:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
access a secondary market transaction
 
02:53:40.389 --> 02:53:40.399 align:start position:0%
and we are in support of the structured
 
02:53:42.790 --> 02:53:42.800 align:start position:0%
settlement protection act
 
02:53:44.950 --> 02:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
that is included in this bill we feel
 
02:53:47.030 --> 02:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
that it's the best way for people to
 
02:53:49.269 --> 02:53:49.279 align:start position:0%
have uh the consumer protections they
 
02:53:51.910 --> 02:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
need when they are required to enter
 
02:53:54.630 --> 02:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
into that type of transaction
 
02:53:57.190 --> 02:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
um and uh on behalf of myself and the
 
02:53:58.550 --> 02:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
national structure settlements trade
 
02:54:00.309 --> 02:54:00.319 align:start position:0%
association we're just speaking in
 
02:54:02.469 --> 02:54:02.479 align:start position:0%
support of that today and uh i'll be

02:54:05.349 --> 02:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
time one thing i'll mention i know
 
02:54:07.269 --> 02:54:07.279 align:start position:0%
senator carson mentioned at the outset i
 
02:54:09.510 --> 02:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
believe mr dear did as well uh new
 
02:54:11.349 --> 02:54:11.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire is the only state that does
 
02:54:12.550 --> 02:54:12.560 align:start position:0%
not have a structured settlement
 
02:54:14.550 --> 02:54:14.560 align:start position:0%
protection act and we feel this would be
 
02:54:16.469 --> 02:54:16.479 align:start position:0%
a a very good measure so i'm happy to
 
02:54:19.429 --> 02:54:19.439 align:start position:0%

bill does not change when an individual
 
02:57:38.630 --> 02:57:38.640 align:start position:0%

02:57:41.670 --> 02:57:41.680 align:start position:0%

02:57:49.910 --> 02:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
prior to their two-thirds date will
 
02:57:51.670 --> 02:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
allow for these residents to participate
 
02:57:53.750 --> 02:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
in re-entry programs and services prior
 
02:57:55.910 --> 02:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
to their release the way the current law
 
02:57:58.070 --> 02:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
is they cannot apply until they reach
 
02:58:00.309 --> 02:58:00.319 align:start position:0%
their two-thirds date which the process
 
02:58:03.030 --> 02:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
being as soon as they get the suspension
 
02:58:04.070 --> 02:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
granted by the court they are
 
02:58:06.150 --> 02:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
immediately parole eligible they'll have
 
02:58:07.990 --> 02:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
a parole hearing within 30 days and if
 
02:58:09.830 --> 02:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
they come up with a housing plan they
 
02:58:12.389 --> 02:58:12.399 align:start position:0%
could be released within a month or two
 
02:58:14.389 --> 02:58:14.399 align:start position:0%
this would allow them to begin
 
02:58:14.399 --> 02:58:15.670 align:start position:0%
this would allow them to begin
programming

02:58:15.670 --> 02:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
programming
 
02:58:17.030 --> 02:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
you know back into the community getting
 
02:58:19.510 --> 02:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
ties in the community going through our
 
02:58:21.190 --> 02:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
minimum security programs as well as
 
02:58:22.950 --> 02:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
work release as most of these people
 
02:58:24.710 --> 02:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
will have been incarcerated for at least
 
02:58:26.469 --> 02:58:26.479 align:start position:0%
three four years and will need some form
 
02:58:28.790 --> 02:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
of reentry services and get connections
 
02:58:30.309 --> 02:58:30.319 align:start position:0%
set up in the community prior to their
 
02:58:30.319 --> 02:58:33.110 align:start position:0%
set up in the community prior to their
release

02:58:33.110 --> 02:58:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:35.349 --> 02:58:35.359 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
02:58:36.790 --> 02:58:36.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of these people will not be able
 
02:58:38.870 --> 02:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
to get into their
 
02:58:40.710 --> 02:58:40.720 align:start position:0%
recommended or required intensive
 
02:58:42.309 --> 02:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
programming until they're two years from
 
02:58:43.429 --> 02:58:43.439 align:start position:0%
their minimum
 
02:58:44.790 --> 02:58:44.800 align:start position:0%
so most of the times they'll go in front
 
02:58:46.070 --> 02:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
of court they will not have completed
 
02:58:48.150 --> 02:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
their sex offender treatment or their
 
02:58:49.830 --> 02:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
residential substance abuse treatment
 
02:58:49.840 --> 02:58:50.630 align:start position:0%
residential substance abuse treatment
yet

02:58:50.630 --> 02:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
yet
 
02:58:52.309 --> 02:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
but that would be on the court to decide
 
02:58:53.750 --> 02:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not they could still suspend
 
02:58:55.269 --> 02:58:55.279 align:start position:0%
the sentence so they can get into those
 
02:58:57.510 --> 02:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
programs earlier um that's not really a
 
02:58:59.670 --> 02:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
logistical issue for us
 
02:59:01.110 --> 02:59:01.120 align:start position:0%
on that end it's more of a court's
 
02:59:02.469 --> 02:59:02.479 align:start position:0%
decision for that
 
02:59:05.269 --> 02:59:05.279 align:start position:0%
um so yes as i said as representative
 
02:59:07.349 --> 02:59:07.359 align:start position:0%
shapiro mentioned we we are in support
 
02:59:09.510 --> 02:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
of this bill and i welcome any questions
 
02:59:11.510 --> 02:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
anyone has on our processes and
 
02:59:15.190 --> 02:59:15.200 align:start position:0%
programming and and so forth
 
02:59:19.510 --> 02:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:24.309 --> 02:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:28.950 --> 02:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:31.269 --> 02:59:31.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um and thank you mr
 
02:59:33.750 --> 02:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
mcgee for taking my question am i clear
 
02:59:36.469 --> 02:59:36.479 align:start position:0%
to understand that a parole a potential
 
02:59:40.630 --> 02:59:40.640 align:start position:0%
parolee can apply for this um waiver but
 
02:59:43.110 --> 02:59:43.120 align:start position:0%
won't be able to access necessarily the
 
02:59:43.120 --> 02:59:44.550 align:start position:0%
won't be able to access necessarily the
appropriate

02:59:44.550 --> 02:59:44.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
02:59:44.560 --> 02:59:46.230 align:start position:0%
appropriate
programs

02:59:46.230 --> 02:59:46.240 align:start position:0%
programs
 
02:59:49.990 --> 02:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
um once they've received a positive um a
 
02:59:52.230 --> 02:59:52.240 align:start position:0%
review and they've been given granted
 
02:59:53.590 --> 02:59:53.600 align:start position:0%
this waiver
 
02:59:55.190 --> 02:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
is that what you said
 
02:59:57.429 --> 02:59:57.439 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question um i might
 
02:59:58.790 --> 02:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
have went a little too quickly for that
 
03:00:00.070 --> 03:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
i apologize
 
03:00:03.269 --> 03:00:03.279 align:start position:0%
once uh so in the current rsa they apply
 
03:00:05.510 --> 03:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
for the two-thirds
 
03:00:06.870 --> 03:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
at their two-thirds date so their
 
03:00:08.070 --> 03:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
sentence the minimum sentence is
 
03:00:09.590 --> 03:00:09.600 align:start position:0%
immediately suspended which means they
 
03:00:12.550 --> 03:00:12.560 align:start position:0%
are actually all eligible at that time
 
03:00:14.309 --> 03:00:14.319 align:start position:0%
they get into their programming or have
 
03:00:16.309 --> 03:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
already done their programming
 
03:00:18.710 --> 03:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
if they are allowed to apply 12 months
 
03:00:20.389 --> 03:00:20.399 align:start position:0%
in advance
 
03:00:22.950 --> 03:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
once the court grants it we still have
 
03:00:24.550 --> 03:00:24.560 align:start position:0%
that you know anywhere from nine to 12
 
03:00:26.710 --> 03:00:26.720 align:start position:0%
months after all the court hearings to
 
03:00:28.070 --> 03:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
start preparing for their release and if
 
03:00:30.070 --> 03:00:30.080 align:start position:0%
they are required to continue with some
 
03:00:31.510 --> 03:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
form of programming they will be able to
 
03:00:33.269 --> 03:00:33.279 align:start position:0%
get into that a lot faster than they
 
03:00:35.030 --> 03:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
would have if the sentence had not been
 
03:00:35.040 --> 03:00:36.389 align:start position:0%
would have if the sentence had not been
suspended

03:00:36.389 --> 03:00:36.399 align:start position:0%
suspended
 
03:00:39.269 --> 03:00:39.279 align:start position:0%
um because normally in these intensive
 
03:00:41.269 --> 03:00:41.279 align:start position:0%
programs they need to do it somewhere
 
03:00:43.750 --> 03:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
closer to their actual release date so
 
03:00:45.110 --> 03:00:45.120 align:start position:0%
they can utilize the skills they've
 
03:00:45.120 --> 03:00:46.710 align:start position:0%
they can utilize the skills they've
learned

03:00:46.710 --> 03:00:46.720 align:start position:0%
learned
 
03:00:46.720 --> 03:00:47.429 align:start position:0%
learned
to

03:00:47.429 --> 03:00:47.439 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:00:49.990 --> 03:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh use while they're reprogramming and
 
03:00:51.590 --> 03:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
going out into the community so if they
 
03:00:53.349 --> 03:00:53.359 align:start position:0%
do it too far
 
03:00:55.349 --> 03:00:55.359 align:start position:0%
ahead of their release date they may
 
03:00:57.590 --> 03:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
have to have some sort some form of
 
03:00:59.910 --> 03:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
refresher course or something like that
 
03:01:01.830 --> 03:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
um to take before they're actually
 
03:01:04.070 --> 03:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
allowed to go back out in the community
 
03:01:08.070 --> 03:01:08.080 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up mr chair yes you may
 
03:01:10.309 --> 03:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
um do you anticipate that you might have
 
03:01:12.790 --> 03:01:12.800 align:start position:0%
a capacity issue at any point as a
 
03:01:15.429 --> 03:01:15.439 align:start position:0%
result of this
 
03:01:15.439 --> 03:01:16.230 align:start position:0%
result of this
uh

03:01:16.230 --> 03:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:01:19.110 --> 03:01:19.120 align:start position:0%
meaning like uh over overcapacity at the
 
03:01:22.309 --> 03:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
moment right exactly uh well we are not
 
03:01:24.389 --> 03:01:24.399 align:start position:0%
over capacity since kobit we've gone
 
03:01:26.630 --> 03:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
down probably on at least at the state
 
03:01:29.990 --> 03:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
prison for men we're about 100 anywhere
 
03:01:32.630 --> 03:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
from 100 around 150
 
03:01:34.790 --> 03:01:34.800 align:start position:0%
lower our head count's about 150
 
03:01:37.269 --> 03:01:37.279 align:start position:0%
residents lower than it was before covid
 
03:01:39.269 --> 03:01:39.279 align:start position:0%
up at our facility in berlin we're about
 
03:01:41.670 --> 03:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
150 residents lower than we were before
 
03:01:41.680 --> 03:01:42.630 align:start position:0%
150 residents lower than we were before
covid

03:01:42.630 --> 03:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
covid
 
03:01:44.710 --> 03:01:44.720 align:start position:0%
um a lot of that has to do with the
 
03:01:46.790 --> 03:01:46.800 align:start position:0%
suspension of the court processes and
 
03:01:48.389 --> 03:01:48.399 align:start position:0%
the trials and and
 
03:01:50.870 --> 03:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
such but we also expedited our
 
03:01:53.269 --> 03:01:53.279 align:start position:0%
administrative home confinement process
 
03:01:55.349 --> 03:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
where we lowered our standards for those
 
03:01:56.950 --> 03:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
individuals to go out on electronic
 
03:01:58.950 --> 03:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
monitoring we just sped up the process
 
03:02:00.950 --> 03:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
so it didn't take two to three months to
 
03:02:02.790 --> 03:02:02.800 align:start position:0%
get somebody else on there so the people
 
03:02:04.550 --> 03:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
that are actually incarcerated behind
 
03:02:07.269 --> 03:02:07.279 align:start position:0%
the walls is less than we had prior to
 
03:02:07.279 --> 03:02:08.469 align:start position:0%
the walls is less than we had prior to
covet

03:02:08.469 --> 03:02:08.479 align:start position:0%
covet
 
03:02:13.750 --> 03:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:17.910 --> 03:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:20.389 --> 03:02:20.399 align:start position:0%
no thank you for your testimony today
 
03:02:21.910 --> 03:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:02:36.070 --> 03:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:40.550 --> 03:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:42.790 --> 03:02:42.800 align:start position:0%
sorry about them good morning good
 
03:02:44.710 --> 03:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
morning mr chairman and members of the
 
03:02:47.110 --> 03:02:47.120 align:start position:0%
committee my name's steve bauer i'm the
 
03:02:48.550 --> 03:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
executive director of the mortgage
 
03:02:50.550 --> 03:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
bankers and brokers association of new
 
03:02:50.560 --> 03:02:51.750 align:start position:0%
bankers and brokers association of new
hampshire

03:02:51.750 --> 03:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:02:54.469 --> 03:02:54.479 align:start position:0%
testifying and support on part two
 
03:02:56.469 --> 03:02:56.479 align:start position:0%
we are the organizing member of the task
 
03:02:59.190 --> 03:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
force that met last summer and fall
 
03:03:01.190 --> 03:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
and through the process we answered
 
03:03:01.200 --> 03:03:02.710 align:start position:0%
and through the process we answered
everybody's

03:03:02.710 --> 03:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
everybody's
 
03:03:02.720 --> 03:03:04.070 align:start position:0%
everybody's
questions

03:03:04.070 --> 03:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:03:06.710 --> 03:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
their concerns with answers
 
03:03:09.670 --> 03:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
we put together a draft bill
 
03:03:12.389 --> 03:03:12.399 align:start position:0%
and that was also a unanimous consent to
 
03:03:13.750 --> 03:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
move forward
 
03:03:15.990 --> 03:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
to where we are right now
 
03:03:18.309 --> 03:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
um just want everybody to know that the
 
03:03:20.389 --> 03:03:20.399 align:start position:0%
remote online notarization will not
 
03:03:22.309 --> 03:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
replace a traditional notary or
 
03:03:24.950 --> 03:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
electronic in-person notary it's another
 
03:03:26.710 --> 03:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
tool in the toolbox that provides
 
03:03:28.790 --> 03:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
notaries the legal framework to
 
03:03:30.790 --> 03:03:30.800 align:start position:0%
modernize the practices
 
03:03:32.710 --> 03:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
to meet the evolving needs of businesses
 
03:03:34.469 --> 03:03:34.479 align:start position:0%
and consumers
 
03:03:36.150 --> 03:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
so mortgage bankers and brokers
 
03:03:38.389 --> 03:03:38.399 align:start position:0%
association supports this bill and hopes
 
03:03:40.950 --> 03:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
that the committee will also support and
 
03:03:44.630 --> 03:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:46.389 --> 03:03:46.399 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
03:03:48.150 --> 03:03:48.160 align:start position:0%

03:04:10.630 --> 03:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire association for justice which
 
03:04:12.870 --> 03:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
is the trade association of about 400
 
03:04:15.190 --> 03:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
attorneys statewide primarily focusing
 
03:04:17.590 --> 03:04:17.600 align:start position:0%
on plaintiff's issues i'm here today to
 
03:04:19.910 --> 03:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
speak in support of sections five and
 
03:04:21.830 --> 03:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
six five the structured settlement
 
03:04:23.990 --> 03:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
protection act and we thank um
 
03:04:26.550 --> 03:04:26.560 align:start position:0%
representatives burch and gordon for
 
03:04:28.070 --> 03:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
bringing forth an amendment to address
 
03:04:29.429 --> 03:04:29.439 align:start position:0%
some concerns that the new hampshire
 
03:04:31.269 --> 03:04:31.279 align:start position:0%
judicial branch had
 
03:04:34.550 --> 03:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:34.560 --> 03:04:35.590 align:start position:0%
 
briefly

03:04:35.590 --> 03:04:35.600 align:start position:0%
briefly
 
03:04:37.269 --> 03:04:37.279 align:start position:0%
mentioned that
 
03:04:38.389 --> 03:04:38.399 align:start position:0%
the structured settlement trade
 
03:04:40.150 --> 03:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
protection act so when you think of a
 
03:04:42.550 --> 03:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
structured settlement um that's put
 
03:04:44.950 --> 03:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
together by folks like peter earley who
 
03:04:46.710 --> 03:04:46.720 align:start position:0%
work at wrangler associates part of the
 
03:04:49.190 --> 03:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
structured settlement trade association
 
03:04:51.349 --> 03:04:51.359 align:start position:0%
on behalf of a client of one of our
 
03:04:54.630 --> 03:04:54.640 align:start position:0%
members an attorney who's been injured
 
03:04:55.910 --> 03:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
so the structured settlement trade
 
03:04:57.590 --> 03:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
association folks go and get the best
 
03:05:00.790 --> 03:05:00.800 align:start position:0%
deal they can for a tax-free annuity
 
03:05:03.349 --> 03:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
payment to man you know for someone's
 
03:05:05.030 --> 03:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
payment after they have been
 
03:05:07.590 --> 03:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
um injured
 
03:05:07.600 --> 03:05:09.190 align:start position:0%
um injured
and

03:05:09.190 --> 03:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:05:11.590 --> 03:05:11.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes um you know due to life
 
03:05:14.630 --> 03:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
circumstance or whatever may happen an
 
03:05:16.469 --> 03:05:16.479 align:start position:0%
individual later on may decide that they
 
03:05:17.429 --> 03:05:17.439 align:start position:0%
want to
 
03:05:19.590 --> 03:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
sell their structured settlement to an
 
03:05:22.150 --> 03:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
entity represented by the national
 
03:05:25.510 --> 03:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
um association of settlement purchasers
 
03:05:27.269 --> 03:05:27.279 align:start position:0%
so all of these folks as well as the
 
03:05:29.190 --> 03:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
judicial branch are on board with the
 
03:05:30.950 --> 03:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
language reflected in representative
 
03:05:32.870 --> 03:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
birch's and representative gordon's
 
03:05:35.590 --> 03:05:35.600 align:start position:0%
amendment to section 5.
 
03:05:37.269 --> 03:05:37.279 align:start position:0%
that is no easy feat when you think of
 
03:05:38.790 --> 03:05:38.800 align:start position:0%
the odds that all these groups are
 
03:05:38.800 --> 03:05:39.750 align:start position:0%
the odds that all these groups are
usually

03:05:39.750 --> 03:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
usually
 
03:05:39.760 --> 03:05:41.030 align:start position:0%
usually
at

03:05:41.030 --> 03:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
at
 
03:05:42.790 --> 03:05:42.800 align:start position:0%
so we just want to thank
 
03:05:44.870 --> 03:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
you all for your work and letting us
 
03:05:47.670 --> 03:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
um kind of hammer that out and then
 
03:05:50.389 --> 03:05:50.399 align:start position:0%
section six the collaborative law act
 
03:05:52.309 --> 03:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
while the collaborative law alliance is
 
03:05:55.349 --> 03:05:55.359 align:start position:0%
its own organization many nha members
 
03:05:56.630 --> 03:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
are crossover members of the
 
03:05:59.190 --> 03:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
collaborative law alliance and they are
 
03:06:01.190 --> 03:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
very much in support representative
 
03:06:03.590 --> 03:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
gordon earlier you had asked
 
03:06:04.950 --> 03:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
if this was a bill that had been brought
 
03:06:06.070 --> 03:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
up before
 
03:06:09.030 --> 03:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
after the collaborative law alliance
 
03:06:11.030 --> 03:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
painstakingly as representative macbeth
 
03:06:11.040 --> 03:06:12.309 align:start position:0%
painstakingly as representative macbeth
knows

03:06:12.309 --> 03:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
knows
 
03:06:14.870 --> 03:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
came up with language to put some
 
03:06:16.230 --> 03:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
parameters on the practice of
 
03:06:17.510 --> 03:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
collaborative law that is currently
 
03:06:19.910 --> 03:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
happening again voluntarily
 
03:06:22.710 --> 03:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
um it was only brought up for the first
 
03:06:25.110 --> 03:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
time last session so this says this
 
03:06:26.950 --> 03:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
isn't an issue that's been you know
 
03:06:29.429 --> 03:06:29.439 align:start position:0%
continuously brought up and failed or i
 
03:06:32.230 --> 03:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clarify um
 
03:06:33.910 --> 03:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
for your mind with your question earlier
 
03:06:33.920 --> 03:06:35.750 align:start position:0%

uh thank you chairman gordon vice
 
03:08:57.990 --> 03:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
chairman mclean members of the committee
 
03:08:59.750 --> 03:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
my name is carol willoughby i am a
 
03:09:01.030 --> 03:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
dually licensed attorney in new
 
03:09:03.269 --> 03:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
hampshire and employed by first american
 
03:09:05.349 --> 03:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
title insurance company we're a leading
 
03:09:07.030 --> 03:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
provider of real estate settlement
 
03:09:09.269 --> 03:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
services and certainly a major consumer
 
03:09:11.910 --> 03:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
of notary services i'm also a licensed i
 
03:09:14.389 --> 03:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
think i already said that sorry
 
03:09:16.469 --> 03:09:16.479 align:start position:0%
i was a member of the stakeholder group
 
03:09:17.910 --> 03:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
and was involved in the drafting of
 
03:09:20.870 --> 03:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
section two of senate bill 134 i did
 
03:09:22.630 --> 03:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
provide written testimony but i'll focus
 
03:09:25.110 --> 03:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
on just two key points here
 
03:09:27.030 --> 03:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
first section two
 
03:09:28.630 --> 03:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
quite simply creates an additional
 
03:09:32.070 --> 03:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
method of performing notarial services
 
03:09:32.080 --> 03:09:33.269 align:start position:0%
method of performing notarial services
remotely

03:09:33.269 --> 03:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
remotely
 
03:09:37.110 --> 03:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
it doesn't take away other provisos
 
03:09:39.110 --> 03:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
we've been fortunate to have the use of
 
03:09:41.670 --> 03:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
governor sununu's emergency order
 
03:09:44.309 --> 03:09:44.319 align:start position:0%
throughout the pandemic but our citizens
 
03:09:46.229 --> 03:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
quite frankly need a more robust and
 
03:09:47.910 --> 03:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
permanent solution
 
03:09:50.150 --> 03:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
our notaries perform a variety of
 
03:09:51.990 --> 03:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
important services which serve as a
 
03:09:54.550 --> 03:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
foundation to the rebuy to the
 
03:09:57.110 --> 03:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
reliability of our legal documents our
 
03:10:00.950 --> 03:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
legal system our real estate documents
 
03:10:03.190 --> 03:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
the elements of a strong safe remote
 
03:10:05.670 --> 03:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
online notarization law do exist in
 
03:10:08.790 --> 03:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
section 2 of senate bill 134
 
03:10:10.710 --> 03:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
without that face-to-face in-person
 
03:10:13.030 --> 03:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
interaction we still need to verify
 
03:10:15.429 --> 03:10:15.439 align:start position:0%
certain things so how do we do that we
 
03:10:18.150 --> 03:10:18.160 align:start position:0%
use enhanced identification protocols we
 
03:10:20.630 --> 03:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
use a robust audit trail and we use
 
03:10:23.269 --> 03:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
secure technology
 
03:10:23.279 --> 03:10:24.389 align:start position:0%
secure technology
both

03:10:24.389 --> 03:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
both
 
03:10:26.309 --> 03:10:26.319 align:start position:0%
ron technology platforms that are
 
03:10:29.750 --> 03:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
available and section 2 of the bill use
 
03:10:31.510 --> 03:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
all of these things enhanced id
 
03:10:31.520 --> 03:10:32.950 align:start position:0%
all of these things enhanced id
protocols

03:10:32.950 --> 03:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
protocols
 
03:10:35.030 --> 03:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
analysis of the signers identification
 
03:10:36.870 --> 03:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
credentials performed
 
03:10:38.710 --> 03:10:38.720 align:start position:0%
they also use dynamic multi-factor

to create this flexible very significant
 
03:11:58.870 --> 03:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
but um i think many of the members know
 
03:12:00.630 --> 03:12:00.640 align:start position:0%
how difficult it is to get any attorneys
 
03:12:00.640 --> 03:12:01.670 align:start position:0%
how difficult it is to get any attorneys
to

03:12:01.670 --> 03:12:01.680 align:start position:0%

credit for getting the stakeholders

together but i was fortunate enough to
 
03:12:17.510 --> 03:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
be invited to join thank you
 
03:12:20.790 --> 03:12:20.800 align:start position:0%

thank you sir
 
03:12:27.349 --> 03:12:27.359 align:start position:0%
at this point in time that's all the
 
03:12:31.030 --> 03:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
people who pre-registered to speak today
 
03:12:33.429 --> 03:12:33.439 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to ask anyone who's
 
03:12:35.750 --> 03:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
in the attendance in the audience here
 
03:12:35.760 --> 03:12:36.710 align:start position:0%
in the attendance in the audience here
today

03:12:36.710 --> 03:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:12:39.110 --> 03:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
if they are interested in speaking if
 
03:12:41.190 --> 03:12:41.200 align:start position:0%
they could just raise your hand
 
03:12:42.790 --> 03:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
so i can get an idea of how many
 
03:12:44.550 --> 03:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
witnesses we have and whether it be
 
03:12:46.870 --> 03:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate to break for lunch or to
 
03:12:51.750 --> 03:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:51.760 --> 03:12:52.550 align:start position:0%
 
and

03:12:52.550 --> 03:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:12:55.269 --> 03:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
we have one
 
03:12:56.870 --> 03:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
one person wants to speak again
 
03:12:56.880 --> 03:12:58.309 align:start position:0%
one person wants to speak again
apparently

03:12:58.309 --> 03:12:58.319 align:start position:0%
apparently
 
03:12:58.319 --> 03:12:59.429 align:start position:0%
apparently
two

03:12:59.429 --> 03:12:59.439 align:start position:0%

03:12:59.439 --> 03:13:01.590 align:start position:0%

03:13:08.630 --> 03:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
if uh
 
03:13:10.309 --> 03:13:10.319 align:start position:0%
we have six people
 
03:13:11.670 --> 03:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
and they're willing to keep their
 
03:13:13.190 --> 03:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
testimony brief i think we could
 
03:13:15.030 --> 03:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
probably finish up without having to
 
03:13:18.550 --> 03:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:27.750 --> 03:13:27.760 align:start position:0%

03:13:41.590 --> 03:13:41.600 align:start position:0%

to have a successful re-entry that's
 
03:16:16.309 --> 03:16:16.319 align:start position:0%
going to require preparation i was the
 
03:16:18.950 --> 03:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
one who negotiated with the doc
 
03:16:21.190 --> 03:16:21.200 align:start position:0%

originally been 18
 
03:16:27.349 --> 03:16:27.359 align:start position:0%
and that was over the concerns that we
 
03:16:30.309 --> 03:16:30.319 align:start position:0%
did here earlier as well as due to the
 
03:16:31.910 --> 03:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
fact that there wanted to be a time
 
03:16:33.990 --> 03:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
period so that um
 
03:16:34.000 --> 03:16:35.269 align:start position:0%
period so that um
individuals

03:16:35.269 --> 03:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
03:16:37.349 --> 03:16:37.359 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be tempted to to slip back in
 
03:16:40.710 --> 03:16:40.720 align:start position:0%
behavior um while they had that 18 month
 
03:16:42.070 --> 03:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
process so
 
03:16:44.790 --> 03:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
we came to agreement on that um i am
 
03:16:47.269 --> 03:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions that you
 
03:16:50.229 --> 03:16:50.239 align:start position:0%
may have about this bill and the process
 
03:16:54.790 --> 03:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:00.309 --> 03:17:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:05.550 --> 03:17:05.560 align:start position:0%

03:17:13.429 --> 03:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
hi could you hear me
 
03:17:16.710 --> 03:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
we can all right um i'm testifying again
 
03:17:16.720 --> 03:17:17.670 align:start position:0%
we can all right um i'm testifying again
uh

03:17:17.670 --> 03:17:17.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:17:20.229 --> 03:17:20.239 align:start position:0%
about uh part one which is uh regarding
 
03:17:22.389 --> 03:17:22.399 align:start position:0%
the laser pointing devices and my
 
03:17:25.590 --> 03:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
concern with um the the
 
03:17:27.830 --> 03:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
laser pointing devices uh the way it is
 
03:17:29.830 --> 03:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
written that it might be overly vague
 
03:17:31.750 --> 03:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
and it might um
 
03:17:36.469 --> 03:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:38.870 --> 03:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
there's uh
 
03:17:41.349 --> 03:17:41.359 align:start position:0%
hundreds of legitimate use of lasers
 
03:17:41.359 --> 03:17:42.309 align:start position:0%
hundreds of legitimate use of lasers
that

03:17:42.309 --> 03:17:42.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:17:43.830 --> 03:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
aren't covered in the exemption of that
 
03:17:46.469 --> 03:17:46.479 align:start position:0%
bill and i believe that the bill
 
03:17:48.870 --> 03:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh is trying to stop people from shining
 
03:17:51.030 --> 03:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
at people's eyes and becoming disruptive
 
03:17:54.070 --> 03:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
and stuff like that um but my concern is
 
03:17:57.429 --> 03:17:57.439 align:start position:0%
that uh the law is not is the the law is
 
03:17:59.510 --> 03:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
written or the bill as written is too
 
03:17:59.520 --> 03:18:00.630 align:start position:0%
written or the bill as written is too
vague

03:18:00.630 --> 03:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
vague
 
03:18:00.640 --> 03:18:01.429 align:start position:0%
vague
and

03:18:01.429 --> 03:18:01.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:18:04.710 --> 03:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
um in the current bill is also vague and
 
03:18:07.269 --> 03:18:07.279 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns i have is the use of
 
03:18:09.990 --> 03:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
lasers for that
 
03:18:11.910 --> 03:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
for protests and stuff like that with
 
03:18:13.590 --> 03:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
laser projectors
 
03:18:15.429 --> 03:18:15.439 align:start position:0%
um because
 
03:18:16.870 --> 03:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
as written
 
03:18:19.190 --> 03:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
it shows the um
 
03:18:20.870 --> 03:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
as the bill is written it says
 
03:18:22.870 --> 03:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
structures occupied structures and there
 
03:18:24.790 --> 03:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
have been protests where people have
 
03:18:27.190 --> 03:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
shined a laser projector
 
03:18:30.550 --> 03:18:30.560 align:start position:0%
to project messages onto the wall
 
03:18:30.560 --> 03:18:31.510 align:start position:0%
to project messages onto the wall
and

03:18:31.510 --> 03:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:18:33.750 --> 03:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
i think that a simple way of solving
 
03:18:34.950 --> 03:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
this would be
 
03:18:38.790 --> 03:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
to add language that says the um
 
03:18:38.800 --> 03:18:40.070 align:start position:0%
to add language that says the um
uh

03:18:40.070 --> 03:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:18:42.630 --> 03:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
must have like malicious intent of or
 
03:18:44.550 --> 03:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
could blind somebody because as written
 
03:18:46.550 --> 03:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
it could be used to squash uh first
 
03:18:46.560 --> 03:18:47.590 align:start position:0%
it could be used to squash uh first

the requirement that the registries of

deeds
 
03:19:52.870 --> 03:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
accept electronic signatures and the
 
03:19:57.590 --> 03:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
definition used of electronic signatures
 
03:20:00.790 --> 03:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
the definition is very broad
 
03:20:03.269 --> 03:20:03.279 align:start position:0%
it was brought forward from legislative
 
03:20:06.469 --> 03:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
federal legislation first signed in 2000
 
03:20:09.590 --> 03:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
or 200 2000 by bill clinton
 
03:20:09.600 --> 03:20:13.349 align:start position:0%

and

03:20:15.190 --> 03:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
the fdic
 
03:20:17.750 --> 03:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
considered that legislation
 
03:20:21.429 --> 03:20:21.439 align:start position:0%
dangerous enough so that imposed its own
 
03:20:25.110 --> 03:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
definition of electronic signature
 
03:20:27.510 --> 03:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh later that year
 
03:20:27.520 --> 03:20:29.510 align:start position:0%
uh later that year
and

03:20:29.510 --> 03:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:20:31.110 --> 03:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
03:20:35.030 --> 03:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
electronic signatures um
 
03:20:37.429 --> 03:20:37.439 align:start position:0%
have the capacity
 
03:20:42.309 --> 03:20:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:45.190 --> 03:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
in bank fraud and what i'm concerned
 
03:20:46.790 --> 03:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
about mostly
 
03:20:49.590 --> 03:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
is the last financial crisis that we
 
03:20:50.870 --> 03:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
went through
 
03:20:53.429 --> 03:20:53.439 align:start position:0%
um i read the report
 
03:20:55.990 --> 03:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
from the financial crisis inquiry
 
03:20:56.000 --> 03:20:57.269 align:start position:0%

03:20:58.150 --> 03:20:58.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:20:58.160 --> 03:20:59.110 align:start position:0%
and
um

03:20:59.110 --> 03:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:01.269 --> 03:21:01.279 align:start position:0%
i'd just like to quote one paragraph of
 
03:21:03.750 --> 03:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
it um a couple of paragraphs are quoted
 
03:21:06.150 --> 03:21:06.160 align:start position:0%
in the written testimony i
 
03:21:07.510 --> 03:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
i submitted
 
03:21:07.520 --> 03:21:09.349 align:start position:0%
i submitted
um

03:21:09.349 --> 03:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:12.229 --> 03:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
mers mers the system by which most loans
 
03:21:14.309 --> 03:21:14.319 align:start position:0%
are bought and sold had questionable
 
03:21:16.550 --> 03:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
signatures on assignments and affidavits
 
03:21:18.389 --> 03:21:18.399 align:start position:0%
attesting to the ownership
 
03:21:19.830 --> 03:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
of the note and mortgage and
 
03:21:21.590 --> 03:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
questionable notary stamps on
 
03:21:21.600 --> 03:21:24.229 align:start position:0%
questionable notary stamps on
assignments

03:21:24.229 --> 03:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
assignments
 
03:21:26.550 --> 03:21:26.560 align:start position:0%
a robo signer
 
03:21:26.560 --> 03:21:27.670 align:start position:0%
a robo signer
signed

03:21:27.670 --> 03:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
signed
 
03:21:29.830 --> 03:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
and sometimes back dated hundreds of
 
03:21:31.830 --> 03:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
affidavits claiming personal knowledge
 
03:21:32.950 --> 03:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
of facts
 
03:21:35.030 --> 03:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
about mortgage they did not actually
 
03:21:36.870 --> 03:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
know to be true
 
03:21:40.070 --> 03:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
one such robo signer jeffrey steffen of
 
03:21:42.389 --> 03:21:42.399 align:start position:0%
gmac said he signed a hundred thousand
 
03:21:44.870 --> 03:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
affidavits in a month went roughly one
 
03:21:47.349 --> 03:21:47.359 align:start position:0%
per minute in a forty hour work week
 
03:21:49.030 --> 03:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
making it highly unlikely that he
 
03:21:51.030 --> 03:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
verified payment histories
 
03:21:57.269 --> 03:21:57.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:59.190 --> 03:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
why is that important
 
03:22:03.269 --> 03:22:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:05.190 --> 03:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
affixed his actual signature and
 
03:22:07.670 --> 03:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
therefore did not have what is called
 
03:22:10.630 --> 03:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
plausible deniability that was his wet
 
03:22:12.870 --> 03:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
signature he could not deny it and he
 
03:22:15.429 --> 03:22:15.439 align:start position:0%
was held accountable for it
 
03:22:17.349 --> 03:22:17.359 align:start position:0%
but this bill as it stands would allow
 
03:22:19.510 --> 03:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
all types of these signatures on
 
03:22:21.269 --> 03:22:21.279 align:start position:0%
anything formed with the intent to
 
03:22:23.590 --> 03:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
authenticate that could mean names
 
03:22:25.830 --> 03:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
filled in by computers on massive
 
03:22:28.309 --> 03:22:28.319 align:start position:0%
amounts of documentation
 
03:22:30.229 --> 03:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
existing new hampshire law governing
 
03:22:33.750 --> 03:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
electronic signatures does not help us
 
03:22:35.750 --> 03:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
it says that parties must agree on the
 
03:22:38.229 --> 03:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
form of the electronic signatures well
 
03:22:40.469 --> 03:22:40.479 align:start position:0%
the deeds offices are not parties to the
 
03:22:40.479 --> 03:22:41.670 align:start position:0%
the deeds offices are not parties to the
agreement

03:22:41.670 --> 03:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
03:22:43.429 --> 03:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
the parties to a mortgage transaction
 
03:22:45.269 --> 03:22:45.279 align:start position:0%
are a financial institution and an
 
03:22:45.279 --> 03:22:46.469 align:start position:0%
are a financial institution and an
individual

03:22:46.469 --> 03:22:46.479 align:start position:0%
individual
 
03:22:48.950 --> 03:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
the agreement on electronic signatures
 
03:22:51.190 --> 03:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
probably in the fine print that the
 
03:22:53.190 --> 03:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
individual must sign which he will do
 
03:22:56.950 --> 03:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
without reading or understanding it
 
03:22:58.710 --> 03:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
we need to think this legislation
 
03:23:00.870 --> 03:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
through and make sure that e-signatures
 
03:23:03.030 --> 03:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
are what we want them to be that they
 
03:23:04.950 --> 03:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
protect not only our economy but our
 
03:23:07.110 --> 03:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
people especially especially those most
 
03:23:10.070 --> 03:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
vulnerable to exploitation and that they
 
03:23:12.790 --> 03:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
hold signers personally accountable
 
03:23:14.790 --> 03:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
for this reason i oppose the legislation
 
03:23:17.429 --> 03:23:17.439 align:start position:0%
in its present form and i oppose it on
 
03:23:19.830 --> 03:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
behalf of the merrimack county registry
 
03:23:22.229 --> 03:23:22.239 align:start position:0%
of deeds
 
03:23:23.590 --> 03:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
03:23:28.550 --> 03:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:30.389 --> 03:23:30.399 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
03:23:30.399 --> 03:23:31.269 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
today

03:23:31.269 --> 03:23:31.279 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:23:33.750 --> 03:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:37.590 --> 03:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
and i think that concludes uh uh the
 
03:23:39.750 --> 03:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
testimony that we're going to receive
 
03:23:42.790 --> 03:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
today i would i would add one thing i i
 
03:23:44.710 --> 03:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
just got an amendment back which i put
 
03:23:46.790 --> 03:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
in yesterday and
 
03:23:48.389 --> 03:23:48.399 align:start position:0%
which i haven't distributed but i will
 
03:23:50.790 --> 03:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
distribute out to everyone today but
 
03:23:50.800 --> 03:23:51.750 align:start position:0%
distribute out to everyone today but
i

03:23:51.750 --> 03:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:23:54.229 --> 03:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
i heard yesterday
 
03:23:57.510 --> 03:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
that a bill which came out of the house
 
03:23:59.830 --> 03:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
out of our committee a house bill which
 
03:24:02.790 --> 03:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
was house bill 540 and you may recall
 
03:24:04.469 --> 03:24:04.479 align:start position:0%
that was the bill that was sponsored by
 
03:24:06.870 --> 03:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
representative chase
 
03:24:09.030 --> 03:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
was heard by the senate
 
03:24:10.550 --> 03:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
and in the senate
 
03:24:12.870 --> 03:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
there were 82 people who
 
03:24:15.269 --> 03:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
signed up in support and zero people who
 
03:24:18.150 --> 03:24:18.160 align:start position:0%
signed up against
 
03:24:20.710 --> 03:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
our committee voted it out 21 to nothing
 
03:24:22.150 --> 03:24:22.160 align:start position:0%
and it was passed on the consent
 
03:24:22.160 --> 03:24:23.429 align:start position:0%
and it was passed on the consent
calendar

03:24:23.429 --> 03:24:23.439 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
03:24:25.510 --> 03:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
but over in the house
 
03:24:28.630 --> 03:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
it apparently was voted on uh this last
 
03:24:28.640 --> 03:24:29.910 align:start position:0%
it apparently was voted on uh this last
week

03:24:29.910 --> 03:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
week
 
03:24:33.910 --> 03:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
three to two to re re-refer it
 
03:24:37.349 --> 03:24:37.359 align:start position:0%
and i was thinking potentially of
 
03:24:41.110 --> 03:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
of adding that on as an amendment to uh
 
03:24:44.150 --> 03:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
to senate bill 130 the content of that
 
03:24:47.349 --> 03:24:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:50.309 --> 03:24:50.319 align:start position:0%
senate bill 134 so
 
03:24:52.229 --> 03:24:52.239 align:start position:0%
uh but i wouldn't do that unless the
 
03:24:53.349 --> 03:24:53.359 align:start position:0%
committee thought that that was
 
03:24:55.510 --> 03:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
something that you wanted to do but i
 
03:24:57.670 --> 03:24:57.680 align:start position:0%
will offer that as an amendment at some
 
03:24:59.670 --> 03:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
point in time
 
03:25:01.910 --> 03:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
yes yes yes
 
03:25:01.920 --> 03:25:03.190 align:start position:0%
yes yes yes
okay

03:25:03.190 --> 03:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:25:03.200 --> 03:25:06.790 align:start position:0%
okay
and

03:25:06.790 --> 03:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:08.710 --> 03:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
in any event is there anything else any
 
03:25:10.229 --> 03:25:10.239 align:start position:0%
other business that we need to address
 
03:25:12.150 --> 03:25:12.160 align:start position:0%
today we do have another hearing uh
 
03:25:14.150 --> 03:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
schedule for next week and what i've
 
03:25:15.830 --> 03:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
tried to do is
 
03:25:17.910 --> 03:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
schedule it so that uh the next two
 
03:25:19.750 --> 03:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
weeks we'll have hearings in the morning
 
03:25:21.990 --> 03:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
and then executive session in the
 
03:25:22.000 --> 03:25:23.590 align:start position:0%
and then executive session in the
afternoon

03:25:23.590 --> 03:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
03:25:26.309 --> 03:25:26.319 align:start position:0%
with one final executive session on may
 
03:25:28.790 --> 03:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
18th i think
 
03:25:30.389 --> 03:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
and representative horrigan do you have
 
03:25:31.590 --> 03:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
a question
 
03:25:33.510 --> 03:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
um well yes i was
 
03:25:35.429 --> 03:25:35.439 align:start position:0%
just an observation which is um the
 
03:25:35.439 --> 03:25:36.389 align:start position:0%
just an observation which is um the
senate

03:25:36.389 --> 03:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
senate
 
03:25:39.269 --> 03:25:39.279 align:start position:0%
has been meeting uh via zoom almost uh
 
03:25:40.389 --> 03:25:40.399 align:start position:0%
every week
 
03:25:41.910 --> 03:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
obviously they're a much smaller body
 
03:25:43.190 --> 03:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
they're not much bigger than this
 
03:25:45.510 --> 03:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
committee but we won't be meeting as the
 
03:25:47.110 --> 03:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
full house until
 
03:25:48.790 --> 03:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
june second and third i guess that's
 
03:25:50.550 --> 03:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
still correct which means
 
03:25:51.990 --> 03:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
even though we could form conference
 
03:25:54.150 --> 03:25:54.160 align:start position:0%
committees if they actually revise this
 
03:25:55.670 --> 03:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
bill instead of just sending it back to
 
03:25:58.469 --> 03:25:58.479 align:start position:0%
committee so like uh
 
03:25:59.910 --> 03:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
i guess we we i guess conference
 
03:26:01.830 --> 03:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
committees can meet before june second
 
03:26:04.229 --> 03:26:04.239 align:start position:0%
or third but we can't vote on the report
 
03:26:06.309 --> 03:26:06.319 align:start position:0%
until the second and third or any
 
03:26:08.950 --> 03:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
subsequent meeting until june is that
 
03:26:11.110 --> 03:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
is that also uh that a
 
03:26:12.870 --> 03:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
correct understanding of the situation
 
03:26:15.190 --> 03:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
as far as anybody knows what's going on
 
03:26:18.550 --> 03:26:18.560 align:start position:0%
with some i'm not sure if i do thanks
 
03:26:20.710 --> 03:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh i don't think that we can have any
 
03:26:23.349 --> 03:26:23.359 align:start position:0%
conference committees until after
 
03:26:26.229 --> 03:26:26.239 align:start position:0%
uh we reconvene because there has to be
 
03:26:28.070 --> 03:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
decisions made as to whether or not
 
03:26:30.150 --> 03:26:30.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to
 
03:26:30.160 --> 03:26:31.510 align:start position:0%
we're going to
non-concur

03:26:31.510 --> 03:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
non-concur
 
03:26:33.750 --> 03:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
concur or
 
03:26:35.510 --> 03:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
non-concur and ask for a conference
 
03:26:35.520 --> 03:26:36.469 align:start position:0%
non-concur and ask for a conference
committee

03:26:36.469 --> 03:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:26:38.550 --> 03:26:38.560 align:start position:0%
okay that would be that would be at our
 
03:26:40.150 --> 03:26:40.160 align:start position:0%
session on the second and third i
 
03:26:40.160 --> 03:26:41.030 align:start position:0%
session on the second and third i
believe

03:26:41.030 --> 03:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
believe
 
03:26:43.910 --> 03:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
so follow-up so apparently i was
 
03:26:45.510 --> 03:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
wrong so the recess
 
03:26:46.950 --> 03:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
so that's not something we can do in the
 
03:26:49.190 --> 03:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
recess from the past session which is to
 
03:26:50.550 --> 03:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
non-concur and ask for a conference
 
03:26:51.910 --> 03:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
committee so
 
03:26:54.469 --> 03:26:54.479 align:start position:0%
i i don't believe that we can do that
 
03:26:56.950 --> 03:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:27:00.469 --> 03:27:00.479 align:start position:0%

03:27:30.150 --> 03:27:30.160 align:start position:0%
