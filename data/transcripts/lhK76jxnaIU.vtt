that's located on 377 south willow

street
 
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
this location has 4 900 square feet of
 
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
commercial space that meets all the
 
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
needs of the dmv
 
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
there's a large customer lobby area
 
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
area for staff climate controlled data
 
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
closet ada compliant
 
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
secure storage area and there's also
 
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
sufficient parking and the ability for
 
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 align:start position:0%
the dmv to provide some
 
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
driver exam licensing activities in that
 
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
in that area
 
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
the department did request and obtain a
 
00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 align:start position:0%
waiver from
 
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
the department of administrative
 
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.590 align:start position:0%
the department of administrative
services

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
to waive admin rule 6106
 
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
so this would be a sole source
 
00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:02.479 align:start position:0%
arrangement and the waiver was requested
 
00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
because again as i mentioned this
 
00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:06.639 align:start position:0%
location meets all the needs of the dmv
 
00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
but we also had a very
 
00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
good negotiation with the existing
 
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
landlord so that the square footage
 
00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
price went from 13.25 to 13.45
 
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
per square foot
 
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
we also if uh
 
00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
without going out to bid that helps us
 
00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
to avoid the additional cost of a fit up
 
00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
for a new location if the if the
 
00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
location were to change and that's a
 
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
significant cost savings staying in the
 
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
current location
 
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
that's the item that's before you today
 
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
and would be happy to answer any
 
00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
questions that you may have
 
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 align:start position:0%

a hundred and eighty thousand plus as
 
00:09:54.389 --> 00:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
earlier mentioned they'll be assessed a
 
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
1100 administrative fee i'm happy to

senator alessandra

what what did we purchase it for
 
00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.990 align:start position:0%
what what did we purchase it for
initially

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
initially
 
00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
i believe it was purchased for the route
 
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:16.240 align:start position:0%
11 project
 
00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.030 align:start position:0%
11 project
but

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
that's what i'd have to guess
 
00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:21.839 align:start position:0%
okay and you said the purchase price was
 
00:10:21.839 --> 00:10:23.269 align:start position:0%
okay and you said the purchase price was
2900

00:10:23.269 --> 00:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
2900
 
00:10:23.279 --> 00:10:28.069 align:start position:0%
2900
correct

00:10:28.069 --> 00:10:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.160 align:start position:0%

representative edward
 
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair so uh i'm just
 
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
curious um who
 
00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
what kind of an entity would be
 
00:10:42.389 --> 00:10:42.399 align:start position:0%
interested in purchasing this parking
 
00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
lot because it sounds like it's
 
00:10:46.389 --> 00:10:46.399 align:start position:0%
primarily a parking lot and and what
 
00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
what sort of purpose might they put it
 
00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.550 align:start position:0%
what sort of purpose might they put it
to

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
my understanding is what they're going
 
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:54.160 align:start position:0%
to do is expand the existing parking lot
 
00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:56.240 align:start position:0%
if you've ever gone by mount major in
 
00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
the summertime you'll see cars lined up
 
00:11:00.389 --> 00:11:00.399 align:start position:0%
along route 11 because the parking lot
 
00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:02.240 align:start position:0%
there just isn't big enough
 
00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
to serve all the hikers that
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
hike mount major so
 
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
they plan to expand the parking lot
 
00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.550 align:start position:0%
they plan to expand the parking lot
follow-up

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:14.959 align:start position:0%
so in order to have the capital to
 
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:17.200 align:start position:0%
expand the parking lot uh should we
 
00:11:18.949 --> 00:11:18.959 align:start position:0%
imagine that they're gonna start to
 
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
charge parking fees
 
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
and and and if so that would be
 
00:11:26.069 --> 00:11:26.079 align:start position:0%
makes sense but what sort of parking fee
 
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
structure do you have any clue this is
 
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
premature i know
 
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware i don't know if they're
 
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:40.069 --> 00:11:40.079 align:start position:0%

a budding parcel the there's no

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
we purchased an acre-sized parcel with a

correct

00:14:19.509 --> 00:14:19.519 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:14:19.519 --> 00:14:21.350 align:start position:0%
correct
okay

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.710 align:start position:0%
okay
and

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:26.389 --> 00:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
what did what did that do to the value
 
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
of the property the fact that you didn't
 
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
have a full moon or well it
 
00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:33.990 align:start position:0%
have a full moon or well it
it

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
we did it to to widen the the person
 
00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
reason for buying it was
 
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
for a transportation project so we ended
 
00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.110 align:start position:0%
for a transportation project so we ended
up

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
taking i i would say about a third of an
 
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
acre off of it
 
00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
plus demolished the residential dwelling
 
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
and now there's no um there's
 
00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
the only value to it is contributory
 
00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
value to the abutting parcel because
 
00:14:59.269 --> 00:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
it's i don't believe it has any
 
00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
development potential
 
00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
so of of the original if i'm not mr so
 
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
of the original purpose
 
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:11.360 align:start position:0%

an acre yeah where we purchased an acre
 
00:15:22.949 --> 00:15:22.959 align:start position:0%
we widened the road now we're going to
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
sell the remnant which is
 
00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
six five plus or minus of an x so we we
 
00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
used about if i might we used about a
 
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
third of an acre correct all right we
 
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
demolished the house
 
00:15:35.189 --> 00:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
correct we paid ninety to eight thousand
 
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
five hundred dollars correct and we're
 
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
moving what we have left for fifty
 
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.550 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
correct

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
would one consider that a good business
 
00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.069 align:start position:0%
would one consider that a good business
practice

00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
practice
 
00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
if you're in the business of building
 
00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
okay would you thank you we're not in
 
00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.150 align:start position:0%
thank you
but

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
just just for clarification is it not
 
00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
the policy of the department
 
00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:10.240 align:start position:0%
to try to to purchase the small sliver
 
00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
that may be needed to widen the road and
 
00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
if those negotiations fail take the
 
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
purchase the entire property
 
00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
uh rather than going through a domain
 
00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
and the rest
 
00:16:25.749 --> 00:16:25.759 align:start position:0%
what we would purchase the tire in the
 
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
entire property if we're going to leave
 
00:16:30.629 --> 00:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
a non-economic remnant so basically if
 
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
the strip we're going to take is
 
00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
other than contributory value to your
 
00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
butter that then we would do a complete
 
00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.470 align:start position:0%
butter that then we would do a complete
acquisition

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:40.480 align:start position:0%

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
to it
 
00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.310 align:start position:0%
to it
um

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
is is a little colorful as i tried to
 
00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
explain in the letter
 
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:08.789 align:start position:0%
explain in the letter
uh

00:22:08.789 --> 00:22:08.799 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
the original owner of the remnant lot
 
00:22:13.029 --> 00:22:13.039 align:start position:0%
which became the wildlife management
 
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
area and the east side lot on the east
 
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
side of 93 there was it was the same
 
00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:20.559 align:start position:0%
owner so the access to that
 
00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
farm lot was through a farm field
 
00:22:26.789 --> 00:22:26.799 align:start position:0%
but when that lot was sold the east side
 
00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
lot was sold
 
00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
there was an agreement between the
 
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
landowner and new hampshire fish and
 
00:22:36.549 --> 00:22:36.559 align:start position:0%
game to provide access to the wildlife
 
00:22:39.029 --> 00:22:39.039 align:start position:0%
management area for hunters
 
00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
and that worked out well for several
 
00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:42.549 align:start position:0%
and that worked out well for several
years

00:22:42.549 --> 00:22:42.559 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
except when the um
 
00:22:47.909 --> 00:22:47.919 align:start position:0%
the farmer sold to uh al's nest golf
 
00:22:50.149 --> 00:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
course which was um
 
00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
i think originally al street associates
 
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
and when they built the the
 
00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
the golf course
 
00:22:59.909 --> 00:22:59.919 align:start position:0%
they had to renegotiate the hunters
 
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
access across that property
 
00:23:05.669 --> 00:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
so the original access in your packet
 
00:23:08.149 --> 00:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
there's there should be a color-coded
 
00:23:08.159 --> 00:23:10.470 align:start position:0%
there's there should be a color-coded
plan

00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
that shows i hope everyone got has the
 
00:23:15.909 --> 00:23:15.919 align:start position:0%
color version of this
 
00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
the access that was negotiated was both
 
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
the the pink and the green
 
00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
and the pink version is was the public
 
00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
access along with a parking area a
 
00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
little bit down the street from al
 
00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.110 align:start position:0%
little bit down the street from al
street

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
street
 
00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.390 align:start position:0%
street
and

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit of a long access
 
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
across a property um
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
for hunters to use
 
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.669 align:start position:0%
for hunters to use
and

00:23:43.669 --> 00:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:46.789 --> 00:23:46.799 align:start position:0%
it was rarely used actually by hunters
 
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
the green
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
section of that plan was the fish and
 
00:23:53.669 --> 00:23:53.679 align:start position:0%
game management access
 
00:23:53.679 --> 00:23:55.350 align:start position:0%
game management access
um

00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
the which is a much more reasonable
 
00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
access we would take brush hogs across
 
00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
the um across that access to go and do
 
00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
habitat management work on the wildlife
 
00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:06.559 align:start position:0%
management area
 
00:24:06.559 --> 00:24:06.790 align:start position:0%
management area
the

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:09.110 align:start position:0%
the
[Music]

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:11.200 align:start position:0%
when al street
 
00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
fell into bankruptcy
 
00:24:16.549 --> 00:24:16.559 align:start position:0%
lcj purchased the property
 
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
and when they purchased the property
 
00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
after a year or two they they made some
 
00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
changes to the golf course without
 
00:24:25.269 --> 00:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
notifying us of these changes
 
00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
that they were making which altered our
 
00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:29.190 align:start position:0%
that they were making which altered our
access

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
access
 
00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:30.390 align:start position:0%
access
and

00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
so this is uh after
 
00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of um
 
00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
conversations negotiations discussions
 
00:24:40.149 --> 00:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
you know on-site meetings um we came up
 
00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
with um a plan
 
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
because they were in violation of the
 
00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
original easement that the maintenance
 
00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:48.310 align:start position:0%
original easement that the maintenance
access

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
access
 
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
agreement sorry maintenance maintenance
 
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
access easement that is the green on
 
00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
your plan
 
00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
b both
 
00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
the maintenance and the public access
 
00:25:00.789 --> 00:25:00.799 align:start position:0%
which would eliminate the pink on on
 
00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
makes it a much better
 
00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:03.669 align:start position:0%
makes it a much better
um

00:25:03.669 --> 00:25:03.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:05.909 --> 00:25:05.919 align:start position:0%
access for hunters and it they they are
 
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
providing a parking area
 
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:08.870 align:start position:0%
providing a parking area
which

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
was eliminated
 
00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:11.190 align:start position:0%
was eliminated
by

00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
a street being developed
 
00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:16.240 align:start position:0%
so there were multiple violations so
 
00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
through the negotiations
 
00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
we came up with this solution and so
 
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
we're releasing the pink part of the
 
00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:24.710 align:start position:0%
we're releasing the pink part of the
plan

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
and gaining public access over the green
 
00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
section which is also our management
 
00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
access it's a much better solution
 
00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:36.400 align:start position:0%
to what was originally there
 
00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to take any questions it's
 
00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
a little complicated i understand it's
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:45.200 align:start position:0%
the map helped
 
00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.390 align:start position:0%
the map helped
um

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
questions from members of the committee
 
00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
senator del sandov
 
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.549 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
so

00:25:56.549 --> 00:25:56.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:59.350 --> 00:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
if i'm to understand what you just said
 
00:26:01.269 --> 00:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
it's owl's nest that violated the
 
00:26:01.279 --> 00:26:03.350 align:start position:0%
it's owl's nest that violated the
covenant

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
covenant
 
00:26:06.549 --> 00:26:06.559 align:start position:0%
it's lcj ltj yes the company who owns
 
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
the owl's nest golf course right okay so
 
00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
there i have relatives that live in
 
00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
campton on eldrith hill road yes so
 
00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:16.240 align:start position:0%
so they violated
 
00:26:19.029 --> 00:26:19.039 align:start position:0%
the covenant which which indeed
 
00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
i'm told that they had a habit of doing
 
00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:24.640 align:start position:0%
um this was our only experience with
 
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
them with lcj um with al's nest
 
00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
we had a different relationship with the
 
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
owner of the owl's nest or al street
 
00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:35.350 align:start position:0%
owner of the owl's nest or al street
associates

00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
associates
 
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
but he's
 
00:26:39.269 --> 00:26:39.279 align:start position:0%
he's not in the picture he's good
 
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
he's out of the picture as we speak okay
 
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
would further question
 
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
so this solves the problem
 
00:26:53.669 --> 00:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
okay we have act we have yes access
 
00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
have there been any other violations
 
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
that we have uncovered at this point no
 
00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
not that we're we have seen um
 
00:27:05.669 --> 00:27:05.679 align:start position:0%
we go out to the wild the pemmy wildlife
 
00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
management area on the west side every
 
00:27:09.909 --> 00:27:09.919 align:start position:0%
couple of years due to brush hogging
 
00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
our conservation officers are out there
 
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
every once in a while to go and
 
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
take care of hunting issues that happen
 
00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
on the wildlife management area but this
 
00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
is the
 
00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
this is the only one that i'm aware of
 
00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:26.389 align:start position:0%
this is the only one that i'm aware of
um

00:27:26.389 --> 00:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
the previous owner we've um we've had
 
00:27:30.389 --> 00:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
violations with the previous owner but
 
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
that's he's gone
 
00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
and um and i just think this is a much
 
00:27:37.669 --> 00:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
better solution even though they were in
 
00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:40.559 align:start position:0%
violation and it really
 
00:27:43.029 --> 00:27:43.039 align:start position:0%
we were a little surprised by it i i
 
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
think the end result is so much better
 
00:27:46.789 --> 00:27:46.799 align:start position:0%
for the hunters
 
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
that want to access the property great
 
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
great it it's great that we solved the
 
00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:53.510 align:start position:0%
great it it's great that we solved the
problem

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
problem

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
how uh and it was asked of me um how
 
00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
does the 1100
 
00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:54.789 align:start position:0%
does the 1100
um

00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:54.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
administrative fee
 
00:29:59.269 --> 00:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
is it in through invoice is it through
 
00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
something just a it's the order through
 
00:30:07.029 --> 00:30:07.039 align:start position:0%
i will leave that to the
 
00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
right so i think you'd want to work with
 
00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
administrative services to see the
 
00:30:22.789 --> 00:30:22.799 align:start position:0%
process that you should use for that
 
00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
um and depending on the
 
00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
source of the funds would depend where
 
00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
the money ends up
 
00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
being deposited so it may end up back in
 
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
the fish and game if you use the fish
 
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
and game fund to purchase that property
 
00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
back in the day yes it would go back
 
00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
back in the fish and game fund yes so is
 
00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
there anybody at administrative services
 
00:30:40.149 --> 00:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
i talked to your business supervisor to
 
00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
get guidance on that i think she's the
 
00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
one actually who asked me because we
 
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
don't we very rarely do this
 
00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
yeah reach out to me after and i can
 
00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
work with you on that thank you very
 
00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:51.669 align:start position:0%

no objection from the members of the
 
00:32:05.269 --> 00:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:09.669 --> 00:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
monday march 28th i believe it is
 
00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:20.640 align:start position:0%

00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
on live stream it sounds like we will go
 
00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
quickly but all the members of the
 
00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:40.559 align:start position:0%
committee have had all of this
 
00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:43.519 align:start position:0%
information at least a week before and
 
00:32:45.669 --> 00:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
have been able to read through it and
 
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
and do it so sometimes it looks like
 
00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:51.200 align:start position:0%
we're just running quickly but
 
00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:53.120 align:start position:0%

00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
beforehand thank you all and
 
00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
