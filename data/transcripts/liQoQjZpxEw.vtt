she was alerted that we'll reconvene at
 
01:26:12.629 --> 01:26:12.639 align:start position:0%
10 30 so i think she'll be here okay
 
01:26:15.750 --> 01:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
i did tell her that that it was 10 30
 
01:26:20.830 --> 01:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:33.750 align:start position:0%
 
well

01:26:33.750 --> 01:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:38.070 --> 01:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
she's not here yetish not that i can see
 
01:26:41.110 --> 01:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
and while um
 
01:26:46.629 --> 01:26:46.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
because we are different than most
 
01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:51.110 align:start position:0%
because we are different than most
committees

01:26:51.110 --> 01:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
committees
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:57.270 --> 01:26:57.280 align:start position:0%
what we might be facing with
 
01:27:00.470 --> 01:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
so i have a placeholder for
 
01:27:03.750 --> 01:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
tuesday afternoon at one o'clock
 
01:27:06.310 --> 01:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
and then wednesday and thursday at nine
 
01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:17.350 align:start position:0%
and then wednesday and thursday at nine
o'clock

01:27:17.350 --> 01:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:19.990 --> 01:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
if we are successful today we'll have
 
01:27:20.950 --> 01:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
three bills
 
01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
left and our committee needs three
 
01:27:28.149 --> 01:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
senate bills and uh
 
01:27:33.030 --> 01:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
we plan on working on those next week
 
01:27:36.790 --> 01:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:43.590 --> 01:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if there are any uh
 
01:27:46.070 --> 01:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
senate bills for ways and means coming
 
01:27:48.950 --> 01:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
from tomorrow's session in the senate
 
01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:50.229 align:start position:0%
from tomorrow's session in the senate
but

01:27:50.229 --> 01:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:27:53.669 --> 01:27:53.679 align:start position:0%
there may be some more i'm sure they're
 
01:27:55.669 --> 01:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
holding a lot of stuff to put in the
 
01:27:55.679 --> 01:27:57.590 align:start position:0%
holding a lot of stuff to put in the
budget

01:27:57.590 --> 01:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:28:00.610 --> 01:28:00.620 align:start position:0%
so we'd have to look at them
 
01:28:00.620 --> 01:28:02.390 align:start position:0%
so we'd have to look at them
[Music]

01:28:02.390 --> 01:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:28:06.229 --> 01:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:11.590 --> 01:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:21.430 --> 01:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
yeah that's another big one that one's
 
01:28:22.629 --> 01:28:22.639 align:start position:0%
going to take a
 
01:28:26.310 --> 01:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:32.550 --> 01:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:36.310 --> 01:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:43.590 --> 01:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
yes i saw hi connie
 
01:28:45.590 --> 01:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
i thought as i was signing on i heard
 
01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
that recording it started
 
01:28:51.590 --> 01:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
it is it's on it has been going since
 
01:28:55.590 --> 01:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:58.149 --> 01:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
so if anybody wants to listen in they'll
 
01:28:58.159 --> 01:28:58.790 align:start position:0%
so if anybody wants to listen in they'll
listen

01:28:58.790 --> 01:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
listen
 
01:29:02.390 --> 01:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
to uh nothing for an hour and a half
 
01:29:03.830 --> 01:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
now you should hear the things we were
 
01:29:11.110 --> 01:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
saying about you guys
 
01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
if if this mode cut this part out
 
01:29:17.510 --> 01:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
we we really need to figure out a way to
 
01:29:19.350 --> 01:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
i was talking to jen about it yesterday
 
01:29:21.990 --> 01:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
to bookmark the different hearings
 
01:29:25.510 --> 01:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
because if you go and try to re hear
 
01:29:28.550 --> 01:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
something it's hit and miss you have to
 
01:29:31.910 --> 01:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
fast forward and figure out what bill
 
01:29:32.629 --> 01:29:32.639 align:start position:0%
you're on
 
01:29:36.790 --> 01:29:36.800 align:start position:0%
and yeah because i miss stuff doing this
 
01:29:38.470 --> 01:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
job and so i
 
01:29:41.669 --> 01:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
i try and listen to pieces again it's a
 
01:29:47.350 --> 01:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:49.189 --> 01:29:49.199 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't know what the solution
 
01:29:51.030 --> 01:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
would be to that
 
01:29:53.669 --> 01:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
an index afterwards maybe with you know
 
01:29:56.470 --> 01:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
the time frames
 
01:29:59.189 --> 01:29:59.199 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping we can go back to normal uh
 
01:29:59.199 --> 01:30:01.750 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping we can go back to normal uh
soon

01:30:01.750 --> 01:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:04.950 --> 01:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
well i think they bookmark the sessions
 
01:30:07.350 --> 01:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
don't they you can usually
 
01:30:09.110 --> 01:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
when you listen back on a session i
 
01:30:12.550 --> 01:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know i'm not sure yeah
 
01:30:17.510 --> 01:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
when i when i when i look back on
 
01:30:19.110 --> 01:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
session i usually scroll and scroll and
 
01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:20.709 align:start position:0%
session i usually scroll and scroll and
scroll

01:30:20.709 --> 01:30:20.719 align:start position:0%
scroll
 
01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
until we get to the right place
 
01:30:26.310 --> 01:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
when it's in the chamber you can see the
 
01:30:27.910 --> 01:30:27.920 align:start position:0%
bill number up on the
 
01:30:32.470 --> 01:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:34.950 --> 01:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
just for new members uh we were one of
 
01:30:37.270 --> 01:30:37.280 align:start position:0%
the few committees historically that
 
01:30:40.550 --> 01:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
had recorded our our wage and means
 
01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:41.910 align:start position:0%
had recorded our our wage and means
meetings

01:30:41.910 --> 01:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
01:30:45.430 --> 01:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
not every committee had a recording um
 
01:30:47.590 --> 01:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
but we we have and i think i think
 
01:30:49.270 --> 01:30:49.280 align:start position:0%
finance is probably recorded as well
 
01:30:52.470 --> 01:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
i think it's videoed but um
 
01:30:55.990 --> 01:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
but we were one of the few so so
 
01:30:57.990 --> 01:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
it's a major step that everybody's is
 
01:30:59.910 --> 01:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
now recording
 
01:31:02.310 --> 01:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
which is not a bad thing and i agree
 
01:31:03.510 --> 01:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
that should be
 
01:31:06.870 --> 01:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:11.430 --> 01:31:11.440 align:start position:0%

yes mr chair we felt that the removal of
 
01:38:27.119 --> 01:38:27.990 align:start position:0%
yes mr chair we felt that the removal of
the

01:38:27.990 --> 01:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:38:30.070 --> 01:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
fees for the certificates was a mistake
 
01:38:31.990 --> 01:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
and the bill should be self-funding
 
01:38:34.149 --> 01:38:34.159 align:start position:0%
should be retained so we can work on
 
01:38:38.790 --> 01:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:43.030 --> 01:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
representative thank you
 
01:38:46.149 --> 01:38:46.159 align:start position:0%
mr chair this is something of a
 
01:38:49.510 --> 01:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh shock because they've been trying to
 
01:38:51.350 --> 01:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
get this through for several years
 
01:38:54.870 --> 01:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
and they really uh
 
01:38:56.830 --> 01:38:56.840 align:start position:0%
strongly feel they need it as does
 
01:38:56.840 --> 01:38:58.070 align:start position:0%
strongly feel they need it as does
finance

01:38:58.070 --> 01:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
finance
 
01:39:01.910 --> 01:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
on division one on
 
01:39:05.270 --> 01:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
but on and it is now too late
 
01:39:07.990 --> 01:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
since this was just decided on on the
 
01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:08.790 align:start position:0%
since this was just decided on on the
republican

01:39:08.790 --> 01:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
republican
 
01:39:12.070 --> 01:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
side on two to
 
01:39:14.629 --> 01:39:14.639 align:start position:0%
restore the fees that we worked on
 
01:39:14.639 --> 01:39:15.830 align:start position:0%
restore the fees that we worked on
extensively

01:39:15.830 --> 01:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
extensively
 
01:39:18.550 --> 01:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
last term and which we have the language
 
01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:19.750 align:start position:0%
last term and which we have the language
for

01:39:19.750 --> 01:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:39:24.390 --> 01:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
um but the reason the fees are not there
 
01:39:27.910 --> 01:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
is that on the
 
01:39:30.790 --> 01:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
legislature has been told by your
 
01:39:31.910 --> 01:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
leadership that
 
01:39:34.950 --> 01:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
no fees should ever get passed in this
 
01:39:38.550 --> 01:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
term so there is
 
01:39:42.390 --> 01:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
enough money in those dedicated funds
 
01:39:43.990 --> 01:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
that they are rating
 
01:39:46.629 --> 01:39:46.639 align:start position:0%
that they will not need it restored
 
01:39:48.950 --> 01:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
because it was built up during a period
 
01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:49.350 align:start position:0%
because it was built up during a period
when

01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:39:52.950 --> 01:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
agriculture was not doing its job
 
01:39:56.390 --> 01:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
in those areas and
 
01:39:58.870 --> 01:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
it appears also that there may be too
 
01:39:59.910 --> 01:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
much money
 
01:40:03.350 --> 01:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
in the animal products fund
 
01:40:05.510 --> 01:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
coming into the animal products fund
 
01:40:07.590 --> 01:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
since it's being used as a slush fund
 
01:40:07.990 --> 01:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:40:11.109 --> 01:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:14.310 --> 01:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
that's something that really needs to be
 
01:40:18.070 --> 01:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
looked at later doesn't really work
 
01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:18.950 align:start position:0%
looked at later doesn't really work
being

01:40:18.950 --> 01:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:40:22.390 --> 01:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
looked at here and
 
01:40:25.430 --> 01:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
it will get looked at later if in no
 
01:40:26.470 --> 01:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
other way
 
01:40:28.790 --> 01:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
when on the dedicated fund committee
 
01:40:31.430 --> 01:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
gets it back on rotation
 
01:40:34.629 --> 01:40:34.639 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:40:38.870 --> 01:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
i really feel that they
 
01:40:42.390 --> 01:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
they are really very little computerized
 
01:40:44.390 --> 01:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
in the department of agriculture
 
01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
this is there is a major step
 
01:40:51.189 --> 01:40:51.199 align:start position:0%
for them in on getting their paperwork
 
01:40:53.590 --> 01:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
under control which is essentially on
 
01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:54.629 align:start position:0%
under control which is essentially on
paper

01:40:54.629 --> 01:40:54.639 align:start position:0%
paper
 
01:40:57.990 --> 01:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
everywhere and they have very few staff
 
01:41:00.470 --> 01:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
they are generally one of the least
 
01:41:01.669 --> 01:41:01.679 align:start position:0%
funded departments
 
01:41:06.149 --> 01:41:06.159 align:start position:0%
in terms of overall funds
 
01:41:10.310 --> 01:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
in the state government and
 
01:41:12.790 --> 01:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
have been putting things together as far
 
01:41:14.709 --> 01:41:14.719 align:start position:0%
as i'm concerned with chewing gum
 
01:41:16.830 --> 01:41:16.840 align:start position:0%
since before i arrived in the
 
01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:18.070 align:start position:0%
since before i arrived in the
legislature

01:41:18.070 --> 01:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:41:21.830 --> 01:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
so on getting this one started
 
01:41:24.550 --> 01:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
which is going to require a year of
 
01:41:26.550 --> 01:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
going out to bid and getting a
 
01:41:30.310 --> 01:41:30.320 align:start position:0%
software system developed
 
01:41:33.830 --> 01:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
i think is getting really urgent
 
01:41:37.030 --> 01:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
and i would appeal that
 
01:41:41.910 --> 01:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
we just pass this on to the senate and
 
01:41:45.030 --> 01:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
put a bookmark in our minds that
 
01:41:47.189 --> 01:41:47.199 align:start position:0%
that something is going to have to be
 
01:41:49.030 --> 01:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
done to look at
 
01:41:52.470 --> 01:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
at um the animal products
 
01:41:55.830 --> 01:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
funding and at
 
01:41:58.790 --> 01:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
at the whole fee structure probably if
 
01:42:01.590 --> 01:42:01.600 align:start position:0%
the department thank you
 
01:42:03.430 --> 01:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
well thank you for your testimony
 
01:42:04.790 --> 01:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
representative there's
 
01:42:08.550 --> 01:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
one thing though you had said that
 
01:42:11.990 --> 01:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
our leadership told us
 
01:42:15.830 --> 01:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
there would be no fees
 
01:42:18.790 --> 01:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
i in my party i have not heard that from
 
01:42:20.629 --> 01:42:20.639 align:start position:0%
my leadership
 
01:42:24.149 --> 01:42:24.159 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
01:42:27.830 --> 01:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
um well all all of the committees seem
 
01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
to be thinking that
 
01:42:36.310 --> 01:42:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:39.430 align:start position:0%

representative almi was referring to the
 
01:42:48.470 --> 01:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:50.950 --> 01:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
speech made by the present speaker at
 
01:42:53.669 --> 01:42:53.679 align:start position:0%

01:42:58.390 --> 01:42:58.400 align:start position:0%

01:43:17.830 --> 01:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
saying no mr chairman could i ask
 
01:43:20.070 --> 01:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
if we retain this bill or are we going
 
01:43:20.870 --> 01:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
to ask

that's a good question
 
01:43:44.790 --> 01:43:44.800 align:start position:0%

page six
 
01:47:27.430 --> 01:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
line 36 it's the fee

for new state bank and credit union
 
01:47:30.159 --> 01:47:31.669 align:start position:0%

charters
 
01:47:34.470 --> 01:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh the fee is going up from ten thousand
 
01:47:36.550 --> 01:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
to fifteen thousand
 
01:47:39.830 --> 01:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
and we heard testimony that um

uh for these type of uh charter
 
01:47:46.229 --> 01:47:46.239 align:start position:0%
the charter work that they do that uh
 
01:47:47.830 --> 01:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
the average is closer to fifteen
 
01:47:50.390 --> 01:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
thousand and they decided that it's best
 
01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:50.950 align:start position:0%
thousand and they decided that it's best
that

01:47:50.950 --> 01:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:47:53.990 --> 01:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
we increase this fee to fifteen thousand
 
01:47:56.550 --> 01:47:56.560 align:start position:0%
and if if if it goes beyond that if the
 
01:47:57.510 --> 01:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
cost of
 
01:48:00.550 --> 01:48:00.560 align:start position:0%

01:53:03.910 --> 01:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
simple
 
01:53:07.109 --> 01:53:07.119 align:start position:0%
uh straightforward motion uh to retain
 
01:53:09.669 --> 01:53:09.679 align:start position:0%
this bill the prime sponsor of the bill
 
01:53:12.310 --> 01:53:12.320 align:start position:0%
has asked us to retain it and it's just
 
01:53:14.229 --> 01:53:14.239 align:start position:0%
not ready at this point in time to go
 
01:53:16.310 --> 01:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
forward the bill needs more work
 
01:53:17.910 --> 01:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
and so i think this can be a pretty
 
01:53:20.310 --> 01:53:20.320 align:start position:0%
straightforward among all members of the
 
01:53:22.070 --> 01:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
committee to retain

also the prime sponsor
 
01:53:34.310 --> 01:53:34.320 align:start position:0%

01:53:39.189 --> 01:53:39.199 align:start position:0%
amendment is put into the bill
 
01:53:41.270 --> 01:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
it isn't the amendment that was passed
 
01:53:44.310 --> 01:53:44.320 align:start position:0%
by the science and technology
 
01:53:47.510 --> 01:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
and by retaining it we can work out
 
01:53:48.470 --> 01:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
something and
 
01:53:52.830 --> 01:53:52.840 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that we couldn't adopt that
 
01:53:56.709 --> 01:53:56.719 align:start position:0%
amendment unless we had
 
01:53:59.750 --> 01:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
a public hearing on that amendment
 
01:54:02.310 --> 01:54:02.320 align:start position:0%
it might not be possible for us we might
 
01:54:02.320 --> 01:54:03.030 align:start position:0%
it might not be possible for us we might
be

01:54:03.030 --> 01:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:54:06.310 --> 01:54:06.320 align:start position:0%
if in our work sessions
 
01:54:08.470 --> 01:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
i'll have to check with the speaker to
 
01:54:09.750 --> 01:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
see if um
 
01:54:13.189 --> 01:54:13.199 align:start position:0%
science and technology can join us
 
01:54:17.030 --> 01:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
and then we'll figure something out
 
01:54:20.830 --> 01:54:20.840 align:start position:0%

everything remains the same while we
study

01:54:53.830 --> 01:54:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:56.310 --> 01:54:56.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative tucker i
 
01:54:57.669 --> 01:54:57.679 align:start position:0%
believe so and as
 
01:55:00.790 --> 01:55:00.800 align:start position:0%
the as the chair said the purpose of
 
01:55:02.070 --> 01:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
this motion
 
01:55:04.310 --> 01:55:04.320 align:start position:0%
is to allow them to continue to work on
 
01:55:06.950 --> 01:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
it if the prime sponsor and other
 
01:55:09.350 --> 01:55:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh people are working on the legislation
 
01:55:10.629 --> 01:55:10.639 align:start position:0%
um would like to
 
01:55:14.310 --> 01:55:14.320 align:start position:0%
would like to do so and mr chair you can
 
01:55:17.350 --> 01:55:17.360 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong on that
 
01:55:21.030 --> 01:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh retaining is acceptable
 
01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
to uh representative loss who's the
 
01:55:25.270 --> 01:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor
 
01:55:28.709 --> 01:55:28.719 align:start position:0%
and also chairman of the science
 
01:55:28.719 --> 01:55:29.990 align:start position:0%
and also chairman of the science
technology

01:55:29.990 --> 01:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
technology
 
01:55:33.030 --> 01:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
committee i guess my my concern if i
 
01:55:34.709 --> 01:55:34.719 align:start position:0%
could follow up mr chairman
 
01:55:37.830 --> 01:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
is that it turns out that
 
01:55:39.750 --> 01:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
really a lot of people are dependent
 
01:55:41.350 --> 01:55:41.360 align:start position:0%
upon the
 
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
work that is done under current
 
01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:45.350 align:start position:0%
work that is done under current
legislation

01:55:45.350 --> 01:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:55:47.189 --> 01:55:47.199 align:start position:0%
and i want to make sure everything stays
 
01:55:48.470 --> 01:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
in place
 
01:55:51.030 --> 01:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
for those projects and efforts that are
 
01:55:53.510 --> 01:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
01:55:56.390 --> 01:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
i would imagine that if they're working
 
01:55:57.589 --> 01:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
under current
 
01:56:00.790 --> 01:56:00.800 align:start position:0%
law they will be because
 
01:56:02.870 --> 01:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
there's nothing changed because we
 
01:56:03.830 --> 01:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
haven't passed
 
01:56:06.790 --> 01:56:06.800 align:start position:0%
this legislation good thank you that's
 
01:56:08.390 --> 01:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
my greatest concern here
 
01:56:27.109 --> 01:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:30.470 --> 01:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
i saw your hand go up and uh
 
01:56:33.910 --> 01:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
somehow sometimes when i
 
01:56:36.550 --> 01:56:36.560 align:start position:0%
pressed on mute it takes the hand down
 
01:56:38.310 --> 01:56:38.320 align:start position:0%
at the same time and sometimes it
 
01:56:40.470 --> 01:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't i do not understand it
 
01:56:44.950 --> 01:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
on the uh there is a major
 
01:56:48.149 --> 01:56:48.159 align:start position:0%
complicating factor which is in hb2
 
01:56:49.990 --> 01:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
and in the budget which is the
 
01:56:51.270 --> 01:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
governor's uh
 
01:56:54.390 --> 01:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
something like 70-page proposal to
 
01:56:56.550 --> 01:56:56.560 align:start position:0%
create a department of energy and stick
 
01:56:57.510 --> 01:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
the puc
 
01:57:00.709 --> 01:57:00.719 align:start position:0%
and the sec and a whole bunch of other
 
01:57:00.719 --> 01:57:01.189 align:start position:0%
and the sec and a whole bunch of other
things

01:57:01.189 --> 01:57:01.199 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:57:03.669 --> 01:57:03.679 align:start position:0%
including the planning section of the
 
01:57:03.679 --> 01:57:05.430 align:start position:0%
including the planning section of the
governors

01:57:05.430 --> 01:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
governors
 
01:57:09.350 --> 01:57:09.360 align:start position:0%
into a department of energy
 
01:57:12.149 --> 01:57:12.159 align:start position:0%
uh we have no idea how that is going to
 
01:57:12.159 --> 01:57:13.189 align:start position:0%
uh we have no idea how that is going to
pass

01:57:13.189 --> 01:57:13.199 align:start position:0%
pass
 
01:57:16.149 --> 01:57:16.159 align:start position:0%
uh in in the end what the senate might
 
01:57:17.350 --> 01:57:17.360 align:start position:0%
do with it what
 
01:57:20.470 --> 01:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
what they're doing right now in uh the
 
01:57:22.149 --> 01:57:22.159 align:start position:0%
finance committee
 
01:57:26.790 --> 01:57:26.800 align:start position:0%
on but that is certain to affect
 
01:57:30.149 --> 01:57:30.159 align:start position:0%
both this bill and 624
 
01:57:32.550 --> 01:57:32.560 align:start position:0%
in some at least some way in fact it
 
01:57:34.149 --> 01:57:34.159 align:start position:0%
already has because he
 
01:57:37.189 --> 01:57:37.199 align:start position:0%
seems to have been preparing things um
 
01:57:40.950 --> 01:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
so on i i hope that we will
 
01:57:44.149 --> 01:57:44.159 align:start position:0%
be able to keep in contact on
 
01:57:47.750 --> 01:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
both with with whoever
 
01:57:49.669 --> 01:57:49.679 align:start position:0%
ends up being in charge of the
 
01:57:51.109 --> 01:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
01:57:54.070 --> 01:57:54.080 align:start position:0%
and uh if she is still there with the
 
01:57:54.080 --> 01:57:54.870 align:start position:0%
and uh if she is still there with the
puc

01:57:54.870 --> 01:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
puc
 
01:57:59.109 --> 01:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
chair on as as we work on this
 
01:58:01.350 --> 01:58:01.360 align:start position:0%
and that we do not try to start to work
 
01:58:03.750 --> 01:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
on this until after the budget is passed
 
01:58:08.629 --> 01:58:08.639 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:58:10.470 --> 01:58:10.480 align:start position:0%
yes as we've discussed you know there's
 
01:58:12.870 --> 01:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
the the error in the amendment
 
01:58:15.830 --> 01:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh which poses a complication for us uh
 
01:58:15.840 --> 01:58:16.310 align:start position:0%
uh which poses a complication for us uh
so

01:58:16.310 --> 01:58:16.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:58:17.669 --> 01:58:17.679 align:start position:0%
i think the reasonable thing to do is to
 
01:58:20.390 --> 01:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
retain uh as we work through
 
01:58:23.189 --> 01:58:23.199 align:start position:0%
how we can engage uh the science and
 
01:58:23.199 --> 01:58:25.109 align:start position:0%
how we can engage uh the science and
tech

01:58:25.109 --> 01:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
tech
 
01:58:27.589 --> 01:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
through discussions with the speaker and
 
01:58:28.790 --> 01:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
and the clerk
 
01:58:30.629 --> 01:58:30.639 align:start position:0%
uh what what's the best way to handle
 
01:58:30.639 --> 01:58:33.030 align:start position:0%
uh what what's the best way to handle
this

01:58:33.030 --> 01:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:35.109 --> 01:58:35.119 align:start position:0%
and the only other comment i have is is
 
01:58:35.119 --> 01:58:36.149 align:start position:0%
and the only other comment i have is is
uh

01:58:36.149 --> 01:58:36.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:58:39.830 --> 01:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
representative tucker uh that yes i mean
 
01:58:42.070 --> 01:58:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh the earliest let's say we work on it
 
01:58:43.430 --> 01:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
over the late summer
 
01:58:46.709 --> 01:58:46.719 align:start position:0%
and and fall uh the earliest any amended
 
01:58:48.550 --> 01:58:48.560 align:start position:0%
bill would come out would be
 
01:58:52.229 --> 01:58:52.239 align:start position:0%
january so everything remains in place
 
01:58:53.910 --> 01:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
until then then it has to go to the
 
01:58:55.510 --> 01:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
senate so
 
01:58:57.910 --> 01:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
so things will be in place for for quite
 
01:59:01.350 --> 01:59:01.360 align:start position:0%
a while with this rent retention
 
01:59:06.470 --> 01:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ames
 
01:59:09.669 --> 01:59:09.679 align:start position:0%
thank you i just wanted to uh first say
 
01:59:10.310 --> 01:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
that i
 
01:59:12.229 --> 01:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
i definitely support the motion to
 
01:59:12.239 --> 01:59:13.750 align:start position:0%
i definitely support the motion to
retain

01:59:13.750 --> 01:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
retain
 
01:59:16.149 --> 01:59:16.159 align:start position:0%
um and thank representative baxter for
 
01:59:17.270 --> 01:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
putting it forward
 
01:59:20.629 --> 01:59:20.639 align:start position:0%
and um reasons for retention
 
01:59:23.990 --> 01:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
certainly include the uh the amendment
 
01:59:25.910 --> 01:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
that was
 
01:59:29.510 --> 01:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
misplaced or mishandled but they go way
 
01:59:31.669 --> 01:59:31.679 align:start position:0%
beyond that there are serious issues
 
01:59:31.679 --> 01:59:32.229 align:start position:0%
beyond that there are serious issues
that

01:59:32.229 --> 01:59:32.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:59:35.750 --> 01:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
have surfaced as uh as we've looked at
 
01:59:37.030 --> 01:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
this bill we've received
 
01:59:39.189 --> 01:59:39.199 align:start position:0%
lots of information some of it on the
 
01:59:41.109 --> 01:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
policy some of it
 
01:59:44.310 --> 01:59:44.320 align:start position:0%
that relates uh more closely to
 
01:59:47.589 --> 01:59:47.599 align:start position:0%
our our expertise but uh
 
01:59:51.430 --> 01:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
but i look forward to working um
 
01:59:53.910 --> 01:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
across the board on that on all of those
 
01:59:56.070 --> 01:59:56.080 align:start position:0%
issues probably with
 
01:59:58.629 --> 01:59:58.639 align:start position:0%
the science technology and energy
 
02:00:00.149 --> 02:00:00.159 align:start position:0%
committee because of the
 
02:00:04.390 --> 02:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh the the amendment problem that we're
 
02:00:07.750 --> 02:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
facing so uh i just wanted to make
 
02:00:11.990 --> 02:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
clear that this is a large
 
02:00:15.669 --> 02:00:15.679 align:start position:0%
challenge that reaches across many
 
02:00:17.990 --> 02:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
dimensions and i look forward to working
 
02:00:20.550 --> 02:00:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:24.390 --> 02:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representatives any further

saying none i'm going to ask the clerk
 
02:00:36.629 --> 02:00:36.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:39.750 --> 02:00:39.760 align:start position:0%

house

02:03:21.990 --> 02:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
house
 
02:03:23.830 --> 02:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
hit the ways and means committee heard
 
02:03:25.830 --> 02:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
this as a second committee bill
 
02:03:28.550 --> 02:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
and we were specifically looking at the
 
02:03:28.560 --> 02:03:29.270 align:start position:0%
and we were specifically looking at the
reduction

02:03:29.270 --> 02:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
02:03:33.109 --> 02:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
in the amount of fines um
 
02:03:35.510 --> 02:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
which in the spirit of the bill is is a
 
02:03:37.350 --> 02:03:37.360 align:start position:0%
rather minor part of it
 
02:03:39.910 --> 02:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh so we're going to acquiesce with the
 
02:03:40.950 --> 02:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
policy committee
 
02:03:44.550 --> 02:03:44.560 align:start position:0%
and recommend that this bill be enacted
 
02:03:47.990 --> 02:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
with an ought to pass motion
 
02:03:51.270 --> 02:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh representative yes thank you mr chair
 
02:03:55.030 --> 02:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh as i said yesterday i i wanted to see
 
02:03:57.350 --> 02:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
this bill retained
 
02:03:59.669 --> 02:03:59.679 align:start position:0%
and that was my heart talking i i i
 
02:04:01.270 --> 02:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
still have a feeling that where
 
02:04:04.629 --> 02:04:04.639 align:start position:0%
some of these fee fines are for
 
02:04:08.229 --> 02:04:08.239 align:start position:0%
uh dealers as well as fentanyl
 
02:04:09.910 --> 02:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
are going down and i i just have a
 
02:04:11.589 --> 02:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
problem with that
 
02:04:14.069 --> 02:04:14.079 align:start position:0%
but with that said and then uh from the
 
02:04:15.669 --> 02:04:15.679 align:start position:0%
discussion yesterday with the full
 
02:04:18.229 --> 02:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
committee and then with the discussion
 
02:04:21.589 --> 02:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
with the um with the republican caucus
 
02:04:23.589 --> 02:04:23.599 align:start position:0%
yesterday afternoon
 
02:04:26.790 --> 02:04:26.800 align:start position:0%
uh i i've changed my mind and and
 
02:04:29.350 --> 02:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
will go along with the ought to pass
 
02:04:29.360 --> 02:04:29.910 align:start position:0%
will go along with the ought to pass
motion

02:04:29.910 --> 02:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
motion
 
02:04:32.229 --> 02:04:32.239 align:start position:0%
and there's two reasons when i look at
 
02:04:33.910 --> 02:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:04:35.830 --> 02:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
really the essence of the bill the
 
02:04:37.030 --> 02:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
policy of the bill
 
02:04:39.510 --> 02:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
really is the fines in this and and the
 
02:04:39.520 --> 02:04:40.149 align:start position:0%
really is the fines in this and and the
uh

02:04:40.149 --> 02:04:40.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:04:43.750 --> 02:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
and the sentences and uh as we talked
 
02:04:44.790 --> 02:04:44.800 align:start position:0%
about yesterday
 
02:04:47.589 --> 02:04:47.599 align:start position:0%
some of us said on both sides uh both
 
02:04:49.109 --> 02:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
parties said
 
02:04:51.270 --> 02:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
we're not sure why we got this bill
 
02:04:51.280 --> 02:04:52.629 align:start position:0%
we're not sure why we got this bill
anyway

02:04:52.629 --> 02:04:52.639 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
02:04:54.470 --> 02:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
so that's one one thing and then the
 
02:04:56.229 --> 02:04:56.239 align:start position:0%
second thing is uh
 
02:04:57.510 --> 02:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
you know i've been the police chiefs
 
02:04:59.270 --> 02:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
reached out to me
 
02:05:00.790 --> 02:05:00.800 align:start position:0%
uh and they they want to continue
 
02:05:02.229 --> 02:05:02.239 align:start position:0%
arguing this and i think it was
 
02:05:03.830 --> 02:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
representative amy
 
02:05:07.030 --> 02:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
that said and i i agree with her that
 
02:05:09.030 --> 02:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
there's a second bite at the apple for
 
02:05:09.040 --> 02:05:10.629 align:start position:0%
there's a second bite at the apple for
them

02:05:10.629 --> 02:05:10.639 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:05:12.790 --> 02:05:12.800 align:start position:0%
in the senate uh committee that it will
 
02:05:14.310 --> 02:05:14.320 align:start position:0%
go to
 
02:05:16.069 --> 02:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
and and that's probably the place that
 
02:05:19.910 --> 02:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
it should be uh just further discussed
 
02:05:22.470 --> 02:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
so with that i will be supporting the
 
02:05:23.030 --> 02:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
ought to
 
02:05:26.069 --> 02:05:26.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:29.910 --> 02:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
today any further discussion on
 
02:05:36.149 --> 02:05:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:38.069 --> 02:05:38.079 align:start position:0%
saying then i'm going to ask the clerk
 
02:05:39.669 --> 02:05:39.679 align:start position:0%

02:07:50.390 --> 02:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:07:53.990 --> 02:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
on realizing that the
 
02:07:57.109 --> 02:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
fines involved are are an
 
02:07:58.950 --> 02:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
intimate part of the policy of the
 
02:08:01.430 --> 02:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
policy committee
 
02:08:02.790 --> 02:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
truly noted i'll make sure that's
 
02:08:06.390 --> 02:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
included in my blurb representative
 
02:08:10.790 --> 02:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:25.030 --> 02:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:28.470 --> 02:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
next is house bill 624-fn
 
02:08:30.470 --> 02:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
an act decreasing the fee to file a
 
02:08:33.030 --> 02:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
petition for declaratory ruling
 
02:08:36.550 --> 02:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
with a site evaluation committee
 
02:08:40.229 --> 02:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
representative zhakishin thank you
 
02:08:45.109 --> 02:08:45.119 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i make a motion to retain
 
02:09:03.030 --> 02:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:06.550 --> 02:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
your motion okay um yes
 
02:09:09.350 --> 02:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
this primarily deals with line two the
 
02:09:11.430 --> 02:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
petition for declaratory
 
02:09:15.350 --> 02:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
ruling um and
 
02:09:18.390 --> 02:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
i think it needs a little more study as
 
02:09:19.109 --> 02:09:19.119 align:start position:0%
to whether
 
02:09:21.350 --> 02:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
reducing those fees from ten thousand
 
02:09:22.709 --> 02:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
five hundred for the full committee
 
02:09:24.470 --> 02:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
hearing and three thousand
 
02:09:27.270 --> 02:09:27.280 align:start position:0%
for a three-member panel reducing that
 
02:09:27.750 --> 02:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
to just
 
02:09:30.950 --> 02:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
one fee of 250 dollars i think there's
 
02:09:32.629 --> 02:09:32.639 align:start position:0%
some concern that it could open the
 
02:09:32.639 --> 02:09:34.069 align:start position:0%
some concern that it could open the
floodgates

02:09:34.069 --> 02:09:34.079 align:start position:0%
floodgates
 
02:09:37.430 --> 02:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
and um and the cost of these
 
02:09:41.270 --> 02:09:41.280 align:start position:0%
rulings um could which are which are
 
02:09:42.790 --> 02:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
based on testimony we're in the eight to
 
02:09:44.390 --> 02:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
ten thousand dollar range
 
02:09:46.149 --> 02:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
um i think we need to look at those
 
02:09:48.790 --> 02:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
numbers and possibly
 
02:09:54.709 --> 02:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:57.260 --> 02:09:57.270 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:57.270 --> 02:09:58.830 align:start position:0%

president
 
02:22:10.710 --> 02:22:10.720 align:start position:0%
representative spellsbury you want to
 
02:22:12.389 --> 02:22:12.399 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion
 
02:22:14.070 --> 02:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and thank you
 
02:22:17.349 --> 02:22:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:20.070 --> 02:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
this is a basic good government bill
 
02:22:21.750 --> 02:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
it's the sort of bill that reminds us
 
02:22:21.760 --> 02:22:21.990 align:start position:0%
it's the sort of bill that reminds us
there

02:22:21.990 --> 02:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:22:25.270 --> 02:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
are things in the law that surprise us
 
02:22:28.230 --> 02:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
senator guyda the primary sponsor
 
02:22:30.230 --> 02:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
indicated this is the only tax rate
 
02:22:31.990 --> 02:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
whose formulation is currently allowed
 
02:22:34.230 --> 02:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
to be kept confidential
 
02:22:37.510 --> 02:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
so in the spirit of full transparency
 
02:22:40.150 --> 02:22:40.160 align:start position:0%
i think we can all agree the formula
 
02:22:41.190 --> 02:22:41.200 align:start position:0%
should be
 
02:22:43.190 --> 02:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
a matter of public record and open to
 
02:22:45.670 --> 02:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
review uh senator gaida also
 
02:22:49.830 --> 02:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
assured us that even though the formula
 
02:22:52.790 --> 02:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
will now be public the underlying raw
 
02:22:52.800 --> 02:22:53.830 align:start position:0%
will now be public the underlying raw
data

02:22:53.830 --> 02:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
data
 
02:22:55.270 --> 02:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
can still be protected and kept
 
02:22:58.309 --> 02:22:58.319 align:start position:0%
confidential so it's a simple bill
 
02:23:00.870 --> 02:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
and a non-controversial bill no
 
02:23:02.830 --> 02:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
objections were registered at the
 
02:23:02.840 --> 02:23:05.190 align:start position:0%
objections were registered at the
hearing

02:23:05.190 --> 02:23:05.200 align:start position:0%

02:25:21.190 --> 02:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
we're scheduled to meet tomorrow but we
 
02:25:22.870 --> 02:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
finished our work today so
 
02:25:25.990 --> 02:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
we will not be meeting tomorrow next
 
02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:27.830 align:start position:0%
we will not be meeting tomorrow next
week

02:25:27.830 --> 02:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
week
 
02:25:31.190 --> 02:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
since we are different than most
 
02:25:31.200 --> 02:25:31.830 align:start position:0%
since we are different than most
committees

02:25:31.830 --> 02:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
committees
 
02:25:35.270 --> 02:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
we have to be prepared and the only way
 
02:25:35.990 --> 02:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
we can meet
 
02:25:38.150 --> 02:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
is to make sure it appears in the
 
02:25:38.160 --> 02:25:39.429 align:start position:0%
is to make sure it appears in the
calendar

02:25:39.429 --> 02:25:39.439 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
02:25:42.710 --> 02:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
so i put placeholders in next week for
 
02:25:46.309 --> 02:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
tuesday wednesday and thursday
 
02:25:48.710 --> 02:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
tuesday will be one o'clock wednesday
 
02:25:51.830 --> 02:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
and thursday will be nine o'clock
 
02:25:56.790 --> 02:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
be prepared to go to work if required
 
02:26:00.150 --> 02:26:00.160 align:start position:0%
if we can get somebody from ncsl or
 
02:26:03.670 --> 02:26:03.680 align:start position:0%
some other expertise to talk to us
 
02:26:08.070 --> 02:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
relative to the stimulus package
 
02:26:10.870 --> 02:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
and we need to understand what's in the
 
02:26:12.790 --> 02:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
stimulus package that's going to affect
 
02:26:13.910 --> 02:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
our revenues
 
02:26:18.830 --> 02:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:18.840 --> 02:26:20.230 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:26:20.230 --> 02:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:26:23.590 --> 02:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
just hang loose and let's
 
02:26:25.750 --> 02:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
enjoy tomorrow and we'll see how next
 
02:26:27.830 --> 02:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
week works out
 
02:26:31.110 --> 02:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
but we should at least look at the uh
 
02:26:33.190 --> 02:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
the three remaining bills that we have
 
02:26:35.830 --> 02:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
from the senate
 
02:26:39.510 --> 02:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
that we retain that hasn't been voted on
 
02:26:39.520 --> 02:26:42.309 align:start position:0%
that we retain that hasn't been voted on
yet

02:26:42.309 --> 02:26:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:44.309 --> 02:26:44.319 align:start position:0%

02:28:37.990 --> 02:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
all right uh norm uh it's pat again
 
02:28:39.429 --> 02:28:39.439 align:start position:0%
the reason i asked that question was uh
 
02:28:39.439 --> 02:28:41.030 align:start position:0%
the reason i asked that question was uh
uh

02:28:41.030 --> 02:28:41.040 align:start position:0%

02:28:43.429 --> 02:28:43.439 align:start position:0%
when i'll i'll alert a lottery to make
 
02:28:45.030 --> 02:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
sure there's somebody from lottery
 
02:28:48.150 --> 02:28:48.160 align:start position:0%
at that hearing at that work session uh
 
02:28:50.230 --> 02:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
because if it's not posted that way they
 
02:28:52.150 --> 02:28:52.160 align:start position:0%
they may not know but i'll just make
 
02:28:53.910 --> 02:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
sure they're aware that they were going
 
02:28:54.870 --> 02:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
to be talking about their
 
02:28:58.230 --> 02:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
three lucky seven bills right
 
02:29:00.950 --> 02:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
and those are bills that are still in
 
02:29:03.110 --> 02:29:03.120 align:start position:0%

all right enjoy the rest of the day
