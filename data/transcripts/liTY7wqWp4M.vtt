00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
there's a conditional approval on this
 
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.810 align:start position:0%
there's a conditional approval on this
and

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:50.820 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
um I have no comments I believe that the
 
00:08:58.130 --> 00:08:58.140 align:start position:0%
rule complies with the statute however
 
00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
um there was some testimony and so I
 
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
think there are still some questions
 
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.389 align:start position:0%
think there are still some questions
okay

00:09:05.389 --> 00:09:05.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:09:05.399 --> 00:09:06.710 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:11.820 align:start position:0%
as I recall the issue we had was about
 
00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:12.710 align:start position:0%
as I recall the issue we had was about
um

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:15.899 align:start position:0%
not being clear about not throwing
 
00:09:17.329 --> 00:09:17.339 align:start position:0%
people out on the street when they're
 
00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
being evicted for uh
 
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
bad behavior essentially could could you
 
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
explain your uh what what changes you
 
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
sorry I thought it I did it the wrong
 
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:34.380 align:start position:0%
way good morning Melissa Nemeth um with
 
00:09:37.009 --> 00:09:37.019 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services uh so the
 
00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:39.420 align:start position:0%
changes that were made we we first met
 
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:40.430 align:start position:0%
changes that were made we we first met
in

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.030 align:start position:0%
in
um

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
April and we made changes based on that
 
00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:48.440 align:start position:0%
to section 3 10 10
 
00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:53.519 align:start position:0%
letter C numbers one and four
 
00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
um the request at that time was to
 
00:09:57.769 --> 00:09:57.779 align:start position:0%
provide Clarity that when these folks
 
00:10:00.889 --> 00:10:00.899 align:start position:0%
received that initial notification from
 
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
their provider that they were seeking to
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
have them leave the residents that they
 
00:10:06.949 --> 00:10:06.959 align:start position:0%
were notified right up front that that
 
00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:09.060 align:start position:0%
did not mean they had to leave at the
 
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:10.740 align:start position:0%
end of that period that there would be
 
00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:12.300 align:start position:0%
another notice and that at that point
 
00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:14.220 align:start position:0%
they would have the opportunity to
 
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:16.380 align:start position:0%
appeal so those are the changes that
 
00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
have been made to this point there's
 
00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:22.980 align:start position:0%
been some subsequent testimony from
 
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
others I don't know if you would like me
 
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
to address that or if you would like to
 
00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:28.260 align:start position:0%
wait for public testimony or if you
 
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
does the committee have any questions
 
00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:43.980 align:start position:0%
I don't have any questions but I I tend
 
00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:45.660 align:start position:0%
to think that what the witness suggested
 
00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:47.220 align:start position:0%
makes sense to maybe we hear from other
 
00:10:50.269 --> 00:10:50.279 align:start position:0%
Witnesses and then have have or come
 
00:10:51.769 --> 00:10:51.779 align:start position:0%
back if that's acceptable to the chair
 
00:10:51.779 --> 00:10:53.329 align:start position:0%
back if that's acceptable to the chair
okay

00:10:53.329 --> 00:10:53.339 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
fine I do have a from
 
00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:58.200 align:start position:0%
Karen Rosenberg from the disability
 
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone for the record I'm
 
00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:29.100 align:start position:0%
Karen Rosenberg I'm the policy director
 
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
at the disability rights Center and I'm
 
00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:34.500 align:start position:0%
circulating a couple of documents that I
 
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
believe I submitted electronically one
 
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
which was the letter to this committee
 
00:11:41.329 --> 00:11:41.339 align:start position:0%
and following your May meeting but I
 
00:11:42.829 --> 00:11:42.839 align:start position:0%
didn't know if you all had a hard copy
 
00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:45.660 align:start position:0%
and then the second document is one that
 
00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
I brought with me to our last your last
 
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
meeting so um I didn't know if you had
 
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:51.720 align:start position:0%
that in front of you so that's helpful
 
00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
to refer to I thought you might have it
 
00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:01.500 align:start position:0%
follow at the last meeting what what I
 
00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:02.940 align:start position:0%
explained to the committee and I think
 
00:12:05.329 --> 00:12:05.339 align:start position:0%
what the committee understood is that in
 
00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:07.740 align:start position:0%
order to be eligible for federal
 
00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
matching dollars for our home and
 
00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
Community Based Services programs for
 
00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:14.820 align:start position:0%
people with developmental disabilities
 
00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:17.700 align:start position:0%
and acquire brain injuries who are
 
00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:20.820 align:start position:0%
receiving residential services that the
 
00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:23.519 align:start position:0%
state needs to provide the same or
 
00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:25.980 align:start position:0%
comparable protections as are available
 
00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:28.500 align:start position:0%
to tenants under our state's landlord
 
00:12:30.829 --> 00:12:30.839 align:start position:0%
and tenant law and that includes the
 
00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:32.820 align:start position:0%
protections that we provide for tenants
 
00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.190 align:start position:0%
protections that we provide for tenants
with

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:34.200 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:34.730 align:start position:0%
with
um

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:34.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:37.009 --> 00:12:37.019 align:start position:0%
from eviction tenants with disabilities
 
00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
and tenants who
 
00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:41.940 align:start position:0%
um you know who may have challenging
 
00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:43.190 align:start position:0%
um you know who may have challenging
behaviors

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
behaviors
 
00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.389 align:start position:0%
behaviors
so

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:47.820 align:start position:0%
the state has not made any changes since
 
00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:51.180 align:start position:0%
the last meeting and continues to Excuse
 
00:12:53.569 --> 00:12:53.579 align:start position:0%
me yes that have you seen their
 
00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
corrective action request they're
 
00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
they're corrected uh there was one I
 
00:12:58.970 --> 00:12:58.980 align:start position:0%
think that they made in April is there
 
00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:00.660 align:start position:0%
another one that followed between the
 
00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:02.700 align:start position:0%
May meeting and today yes
 
00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
they did not send that to me is there no
 
00:13:10.069 --> 00:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:11.820 align:start position:0%
well this is different than the one we
 
00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
had at the June meet at the May meeting
 
00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:19.980 align:start position:0%
it's it's amending it's it's shoppy no I
 
00:13:23.389 --> 00:13:23.399 align:start position:0%
mean for example on it says notice of
 
00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
the resident's right to remain in their
 
00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:27.180 align:start position:0%
residence rather than the right to
 
00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
continued Services which is a lot
 
00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
clearer and ex and I think that had been
 
00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:35.940 align:start position:0%
made actually excuse me before the May
 
00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:37.310 align:start position:0%
made actually excuse me before the May
meeting

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:39.720 align:start position:0%
it wasn't shown to us at the May meeting
 
00:13:41.389 --> 00:13:41.399 align:start position:0%
it's not what we discussed at the May
 
00:13:41.399 --> 00:13:43.310 align:start position:0%
it's not what we discussed at the May
meeting

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:13:46.329 --> 00:13:46.339 align:start position:0%
unless I'm exceedingly confused
 
00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
which is possible would you like to hear
 
00:13:50.269 --> 00:13:50.279 align:start position:0%
from this the department about that
 
00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:53.700 align:start position:0%
first and then well anyway is this the
 
00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
version that you are concerned about
 
00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:57.660 align:start position:0%
this this is the version I'm concerned
 
00:14:00.829 --> 00:14:00.839 align:start position:0%
about because what it does not do is
 
00:14:03.949 --> 00:14:03.959 align:start position:0%
provide pre-eviction due process
 
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
protections for people with
 
00:14:08.329 --> 00:14:08.339 align:start position:0%
developmental or brain disabilities or
 
00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:11.100 align:start position:0%
brain injuries who have allegedly
 
00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:14.220 align:start position:0%
engaged in certain types of behaviors
 
00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
involving property damage or bodily harm
 
00:14:19.009 --> 00:14:19.019 align:start position:0%
and you have to keep in mind these are
 
00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:22.260 align:start position:0%
allegations only and in the private
 
00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:25.740 align:start position:0%
landlord-tenant context when a private
 
00:14:28.009 --> 00:14:28.019 align:start position:0%
landlord is faced with a tenant who
 
00:14:31.129 --> 00:14:31.139 align:start position:0%
allegedly has engaged in behaviors which
 
00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
might be involving property damage or
 
00:14:37.129 --> 00:14:37.139 align:start position:0%
even causing harm or placing some other
 
00:14:40.069 --> 00:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
tenant at risk those tenants are
 
00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
entitled to Due Process a hearing before
 
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
an impartial judge in court who would
 
00:14:48.829 --> 00:14:48.839 align:start position:0%
make the determination about whether the
 
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:51.180 align:start position:0%
landlord met their responsibility their
 
00:14:54.189 --> 00:14:54.199 align:start position:0%
burden of proof to sustain an eviction
 
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
and in
 
00:14:59.150 --> 00:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
and that is a really important right
 
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
that all tenants in this state have
 
00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
but it's carved out from these rules and
 
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
as I explained earlier the Federal Law
 
00:15:11.949 --> 00:15:11.959 align:start position:0%
requires the state to provide comparable
 
00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:14.940 align:start position:0%
protections if those protections are not
 
00:15:17.689 --> 00:15:17.699 align:start position:0%
available under state law so New
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state law land Lieutenant law
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
does exclude these kinds of housing
 
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
programs from our state law so now we're
 
00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:27.660 align:start position:0%
in comparable land right we have to
 
00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
provide comparable protections
 
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:33.660 align:start position:0%
but comparable includes due process
 
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
pre-deprivation okay well this version
 
00:15:38.389 --> 00:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
that I'm looking at
 
00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:42.540 align:start position:0%
says that in the case where they have
 
00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:43.269 align:start position:0%
says that in the case where they have
a

00:15:43.269 --> 00:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:48.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:50.569 --> 00:15:50.579 align:start position:0%
shall provide 72 hours before the
 
00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:53.940 align:start position:0%
termination and inform the resident this
 
00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:56.100 align:start position:0%
notice is not an order requiring for the
 
00:15:58.129 --> 00:15:58.139 align:start position:0%
vacate and include the rights of resin
 
00:15:59.930 --> 00:15:59.940 align:start position:0%
to appeal the provider's decision to
 
00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:02.940 align:start position:0%
terminate The Residency agreement and if
 
00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:05.940 align:start position:0%
it ended there it would be perfect the
 
00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:09.660 align:start position:0%
problem is that if you look further in
 
00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:12.420 align:start position:0%
the regs too I think it's Section 3 10
 
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
12. it it excludes those two kinds of
 
00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:19.380 align:start position:0%
situations from pre-deprivation due
 
00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:20.629 align:start position:0%
situations from pre-deprivation due
process

00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:22.980 align:start position:0%
so those residents can stay in the
 
00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:25.740 align:start position:0%
residence for three more days and then
 
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
they will receive a second notice so a
 
00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:30.540 align:start position:0%
total of six days and at the end of
 
00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:33.300 align:start position:0%
those six days they can file an appeal
 
00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:36.060 align:start position:0%
but they are kicked out of the residence
 
00:16:38.509 --> 00:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
and that's the problem because they can
 
00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:40.500 align:start position:0%
file an appeal but they've already lost
 
00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:43.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:47.220 align:start position:0%
yes represent Broda please
 
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
thank you so at the LA I wasn't here at
 
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
the last meeting but I did get an update
 
00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:55.740 align:start position:0%
and did you did you ex discuss this at
 
00:16:58.129 --> 00:16:58.139 align:start position:0%
the last meeting in May specifically yes
 
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
okay and I was under the impression
 
00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:03.720 align:start position:0%
based on what was said that those things
 
00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:07.380 align:start position:0%
would be considered and brought to us
 
00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:10.799 align:start position:0%
today yeah so but the department that it
 
00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:12.660 align:start position:0%
goes on to say in
 
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:16.740 align:start position:0%
shall vacate within three business days
 
00:17:19.309 --> 00:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
unless the resident files a notice of
 
00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:21.660 align:start position:0%
intent to to reconsider or essentially
 
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
it files an appeal
 
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
so but but if you let me just pull out
 
00:17:28.429 --> 00:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
the rule I had it right there and while
 
00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:29.940 align:start position:0%
you're doing that if I could have a
 
00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
follow-up so I would like to ask the
 
00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.710 align:start position:0%
follow-up so I would like to ask the
staff

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:33.720 align:start position:0%
staff
 
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
are you saying then therefore the things
 
00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
that were brought up that we expected a
 
00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
revision to include or at least consider
 
00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:44.940 align:start position:0%
was not is not here
 
00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:47.460 align:start position:0%
he's not in our package
 
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
um the the conditional approval from May
 
00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
12 2023 is the last conditional approval
 
00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
at the last meeting the department was
 
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
asked to give a
 
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.730 align:start position:0%
asked to give a
um

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:03.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
analysis of how other states
 
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
did this yes which they did um send to
 
00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.090 align:start position:0%
did this yes which they did um send to
us

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:11.100 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:14.700 align:start position:0%
and um the problem with that is that
 
00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
although it is interesting information
 
00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
um it's not relevant to
 
00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:23.940 align:start position:0%
how New Hampshire does the rules
 
00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
um so that's that's why I didn't talk
 
00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
about it it just I mean it tells you
 
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
what some of the other states do I think
 
00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:32.460 align:start position:0%
the problem here is the
 
00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:35.220 align:start position:0%
the definition of of comparable because
 
00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:38.100 align:start position:0%
comparable means similar so the question
 
00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:40.980 align:start position:0%
almost is becoming a policy question is
 
00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:46.020 align:start position:0%
this a similar program to the Federal
 
00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:50.340 align:start position:0%
or not and I can't answer that for you
 
00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
and then my last question yeah please
 
00:18:54.409 --> 00:18:54.419 align:start position:0%
there is in the in the part that
 
00:18:57.049 --> 00:18:57.059 align:start position:0%
representative chair Maguire is talking
 
00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:00.780 align:start position:0%
about it's uh C4 I don't know exactly
 
00:19:03.049 --> 00:19:03.059 align:start position:0%
what page it's on but there's an edit
 
00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:05.700 align:start position:0%
about from OLS to The Simpsons it's a
 
00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:07.980 align:start position:0%
grim it's really a grammatical comment
 
00:19:11.409 --> 00:19:11.419 align:start position:0%
but am I to understand that this part
 
00:19:13.789 --> 00:19:13.799 align:start position:0%
where it says in the cases where the
 
00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
behavior of the resident poses a serious
 
00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:17.340 align:start position:0%
threat of bodily harm
 
00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
this part is not changed that your
 
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
comment is just strictly editorial
 
00:19:24.289 --> 00:19:24.299 align:start position:0%
that is correct okay
 
00:19:27.529 --> 00:19:27.539 align:start position:0%
and and to answer your question chair if
 
00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:29.940 align:start position:0%
you if you notice um what you are
 
00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:31.919 align:start position:0%
referring to is on page 20 I have it in
 
00:19:35.049 --> 00:19:35.059 align:start position:0%
front of me yeah so C4
 
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
indicates that
 
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
um and when you're reading include the
 
00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:41.700 align:start position:0%
rights of the resident to appeal in
 
00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:43.220 align:start position:0%
accordance with
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
310.12 below so then if you flip over to
 
00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
um and you look at it's I'm 3 10 12
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
paragraph D it provides that
 
00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:01.980 align:start position:0%
um if the hearing is requested the
 
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
provider shall continue to provide the
 
00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
residential services until a decision is
 
00:20:09.409 --> 00:20:09.419 align:start position:0%
rendered and here's where the problem
 
00:20:12.409 --> 00:20:12.419 align:start position:0%
lies unless the reason for termination
 
00:20:15.289 --> 00:20:15.299 align:start position:0%
is the behavior of the resident posing a
 
00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:17.340 align:start position:0%
serious threat of bodily harm
 
00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:19.980 align:start position:0%
or substantial damage
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
so that's that's the carve out so in
 
00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
those instances they've removed the
 
00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
right to pre-eviction due process
 
00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:32.700 align:start position:0%
and I think the committee was really
 
00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
concerned that
 
00:20:37.909 --> 00:20:37.919 align:start position:0%
allowing this to proceed besides the
 
00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
fact that it conflicts with what the
 
00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
Federal Law requires the state to do is
 
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
that it could put vulnerable individuals
 
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
at Great risk of homelessness because
 
00:20:51.529 --> 00:20:51.539 align:start position:0%
although the department added a
 
00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:54.660 align:start position:0%
provision for an emergency team meeting
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
to occur there's not an assurance that
 
00:21:00.289 --> 00:21:00.299 align:start position:0%
the person would be provided with
 
00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
suitable alternative housing before they
 
00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:05.340 align:start position:0%
could be evicted
 
00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:08.940 align:start position:0%
so I think that was in part why folks in
 
00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
the committee wanted to work wondering
 
00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:13.140 align:start position:0%
what other states did Even though like I
 
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
said it's it's not really relevant
 
00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
because the what the Federal Law
 
00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:18.900 align:start position:0%
requires is for states to look at their
 
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
own landlord tenant laws and provide
 
00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:23.340 align:start position:0%
comparable protections as are afforded
 
00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
to tenants under their own landlord
 
00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:28.260 align:start position:0%
tenant laws
 
00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you so
 
00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.029 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:21:56.029 --> 00:21:56.039 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:21:57.890 --> 00:21:57.900 align:start position:0%
good morning again for the record my
 
00:21:59.270 --> 00:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
name is Melissa Nemeth with the
 
00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:01.740 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:05.700 align:start position:0%
so the I think um attorney yuniz said it
 
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
well and that we're looking at the
 
00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
definition of the word comparable and
 
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
that does not mean 100 equal so in in
 
00:22:15.289 --> 00:22:15.299 align:start position:0%
this case what the state has tried to do
 
00:22:16.789 --> 00:22:16.799 align:start position:0%
is say well the landlord tenant laws
 
00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
don't apply what can we do that is most
 
00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
closely aligned for these individuals
 
00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:23.580 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:25.860 align:start position:0%
request for the team meeting that was
 
00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:28.620 align:start position:0%
just brought up so that is on page 20 of
 
00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:31.140 align:start position:0%
the conditional approval request
 
00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
um it's paragraph five on that page that
 
00:22:36.409 --> 00:22:36.419 align:start position:0%
provides for if an individual is given
 
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
this notice that their provider intends
 
00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
to terminate their agreement within 72
 
00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.409 align:start position:0%
to terminate their agreement within 72
hours

00:22:42.409 --> 00:22:42.419 align:start position:0%
hours
 
00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:44.460 align:start position:0%
that goes out to the members of their
 
00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:46.020 align:start position:0%
team and they have to immediately
 
00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:48.260 align:start position:0%
convene a team meeting within 24 hours
 
00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:51.900 align:start position:0%
and determine and take the appropriate
 
00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
course of action to ensure that the
 
00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.010 align:start position:0%
course of action to ensure that the
resident

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:55.020 align:start position:0%
resident
 
00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
ensure their health and safety and also
 
00:22:59.570 --> 00:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
ensure that the resident has access to
 
00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:01.980 align:start position:0%
an alternative safe residence and
 
00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:04.620 align:start position:0%
actually the state feels this is more
 
00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:06.360 align:start position:0%
protective than the landlord tenant law
 
00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
because in in ordinary landlord tenant
 
00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
law there isn't a team of folks around
 
00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
you to help support you and find
 
00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
something else and the state's goal here
 
00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
is to absolutely ensure that people are
 
00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:20.220 align:start position:0%
not rendered homeless and now they still
 
00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:22.500 align:start position:0%
do have the right to appeal so they
 
00:23:24.169 --> 00:23:24.179 align:start position:0%
might be placed in an alternative
 
00:23:27.049 --> 00:23:27.059 align:start position:0%
residence while that appeal is pending
 
00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:28.860 align:start position:0%
but they will still they're not losing
 
00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:31.980 align:start position:0%
that right to the appeal so that
 
00:23:34.549 --> 00:23:34.559 align:start position:0%
appeal could you know turn out in a
 
00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
whole different way but in the in that
 
00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
interim period there is access to an
 
00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:43.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:46.380 align:start position:0%
so as a result of the last meeting in
 
00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:48.289 align:start position:0%
so as a result of the last meeting in
May

00:23:48.289 --> 00:23:48.299 align:start position:0%
May
 
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
your pal your policy didn't change
 
00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:53.820 align:start position:0%
because you felt that you had already
 
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
addressed that
 
00:23:59.570 --> 00:23:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:01.789 --> 00:24:01.799 align:start position:0%
in the the changes that you've seen now
 
00:24:03.409 --> 00:24:03.419 align:start position:0%
there's in that paragraph that I'm
 
00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:04.860 align:start position:0%
talking about there are a couple of
 
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
track changes you will see there that
 
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
was based on testimony in the April
 
00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:12.900 align:start position:0%
hearing so we the changes that were made
 
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
that are reflected here were as a result
 
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
of those conversations that took place
 
00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
in April
 
00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
at the May meeting the only as I was
 
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
pointed out the only requests of the
 
00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
department was to look and see and
 
00:24:27.169 --> 00:24:27.179 align:start position:0%
provide an analysis as it were as to how
 
00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:31.730 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:31.740 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:34.549 --> 00:24:34.559 align:start position:0%
there was concern on the by the Kimmy by
 
00:24:37.909 --> 00:24:37.919 align:start position:0%
the committee that
 
00:24:37.919 --> 00:24:40.250 align:start position:0%
the committee that
these

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
this this policy that was presented in
 
00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:44.580 align:start position:0%
May wasn't enough
 
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
and he
 
00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:49.220 align:start position:0%
what was done to
 
00:24:52.789 --> 00:24:52.799 align:start position:0%
confirm that or analyze that or address
 
00:24:52.799 --> 00:24:54.049 align:start position:0%
confirm that or analyze that or address
that

00:24:54.049 --> 00:24:54.059 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:56.100 align:start position:0%
I mean the Department's position really
 
00:24:58.430 --> 00:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
didn't change we've taken a look and
 
00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
feel that this is the most appropriate
 
00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:02.100 align:start position:0%
thing to do for the folks here in New
 
00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:04.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to make sure that they if they
 
00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:06.780 align:start position:0%
are engaging in these behaviors and need
 
00:25:08.149 --> 00:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
to leave their residents that they have
 
00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:10.140 align:start position:0%
access to another residence in an
 
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate amount of time and they
 
00:25:13.549 --> 00:25:13.559 align:start position:0%
would have their meeting within 24 hours
 
00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
of getting that notice to ensure they
 
00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:17.400 align:start position:0%
have somewhere safe and appropriate to
 
00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.649 align:start position:0%
have somewhere safe and appropriate to
go

00:25:18.649 --> 00:25:18.659 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:25:21.049 --> 00:25:21.059 align:start position:0%
this is in fact better than the original
 
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
proposal because it does specifically
 
00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:28.140 align:start position:0%
say that the T the meeting will
 
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
make ensure they have a safe place to go
 
00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:31.909 align:start position:0%
make ensure they have a safe place to go
which

00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:34.620 align:start position:0%
I know that last month I was looking at
 
00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
the original proposal not the corrective
 
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
action or the conditional approval
 
00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:43.909 align:start position:0%
action or the conditional approval
request

00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
anyone else have a question yes please
 
00:25:48.169 --> 00:25:48.179 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn so you know I'm just
 
00:25:48.179 --> 00:25:49.250 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn so you know I'm just
wondering

00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:49.260 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
I understand what you're saying is that
 
00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
that you think this is I guess
 
00:25:55.789 --> 00:25:55.799 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious
 
00:25:59.149 --> 00:25:59.159 align:start position:0%
what would be the problem of of require
 
00:26:02.029 --> 00:26:02.039 align:start position:0%
of all of providing that the person can
 
00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:04.980 align:start position:0%
remain pending the results of the appeal
 
00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:07.140 align:start position:0%
I mean it sounds like the appeal it
 
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
sounds like it all has to happen very
 
00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:09.789 align:start position:0%
sounds like it all has to happen very
quickly

00:26:09.789 --> 00:26:09.799 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
a part of the department is that even
 
00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:16.140 align:start position:0%
though that is sort of a condensed uh
 
00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:17.580 align:start position:0%
you know as you mentioned it goes kind
 
00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
of quickly is that if someone's Behavior
 
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
has gotten to that point it could still
 
00:26:24.769 --> 00:26:24.779 align:start position:0%
be risky not only to them but to the
 
00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
provider and to the other residents in
 
00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
the home and as I had mentioned the last
 
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
time the department is kind of looking
 
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
at the whole picture where we also have
 
00:26:34.669 --> 00:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
an obligation to protect the other
 
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
people in that residence so this is
 
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
trying to strike a balance between to
 
00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
try to keep everybody safe and get
 
00:26:43.669 --> 00:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
everybody in the appropriate setting and
 
00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
get them the appropriate services that
 
00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:46.500 align:start position:0%
they need
 
00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
Madam chair yes Senator
 
00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
um would it be appropriate for me to ask
 
00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
what ensuring
 
00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:57.830 align:start position:0%
what ensuring
um

00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:01.500 align:start position:0%
access to housing looks like
 
00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
I think it can look very different
 
00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:04.860 align:start position:0%
depending on the situation so that's
 
00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:07.140 align:start position:0%
sort of a hard uh question to answer but
 
00:27:09.409 --> 00:27:09.419 align:start position:0%
I had mentioned the last time that
 
00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:11.820 align:start position:0%
um you know it's it's no surprise that
 
00:27:13.549 --> 00:27:13.559 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire for these folks as well
 
00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
as you know the rest of the general
 
00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:17.460 align:start position:0%
population there are housing shortages
 
00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:19.140 align:start position:0%
and things of that nature in some
 
00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:21.900 align:start position:0%
instances it might mean and this would
 
00:27:24.769 --> 00:27:24.779 align:start position:0%
be you know not the ideal it could mean
 
00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:28.620 align:start position:0%
that they go to a hotel but have staff
 
00:27:30.289 --> 00:27:30.299 align:start position:0%
supporting them while something can be
 
00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
found in some instances there might be a
 
00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:35.340 align:start position:0%
respite home that has an opening or
 
00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:37.140 align:start position:0%
provider that can be found that would
 
00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
provide these services on a number
 
00:27:42.169 --> 00:27:42.179 align:start position:0%
emergency basis while the team is still
 
00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:44.220 align:start position:0%
figuring out it may be that this is an
 
00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:46.980 align:start position:0%
interim step and looking for another
 
00:27:48.769 --> 00:27:48.779 align:start position:0%
long-term alternative might take some
 
00:27:51.049 --> 00:27:51.059 align:start position:0%
time but those are some of what might
 
00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:58.730 align:start position:0%
 
Facebook

00:27:58.730 --> 00:27:58.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:04.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:07.620 align:start position:0%
I'll make the motion and I can if
 
00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:10.100 align:start position:0%
there's a second I'd like to speak to it
 
00:28:13.549 --> 00:28:13.559 align:start position:0%
okay I'll I'll offer the second all
 
00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:16.020 align:start position:0%
right what representative lamb what is
 
00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:17.700 align:start position:0%
your motion by the way pardon what is
 
00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:19.740 align:start position:0%
your emotion I'm sorry my motion is to
 
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
approve all right thank you and I I
 
00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
guess I would say this I think that uh
 
00:28:27.049 --> 00:28:27.059 align:start position:0%
Miss Rosenberg raises a very raises
 
00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
valid points but
 
00:28:33.169 --> 00:28:33.179 align:start position:0%
I think the response at least satisfies
 
00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:35.220 align:start position:0%
me in in this sense first of all and
 
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
this may be just simply be my uh my not
 
00:28:40.909 --> 00:28:40.919 align:start position:0%
being as as thorough as I should have
 
00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:43.500 align:start position:0%
but I did not realize this I think maybe
 
00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
I was reading the same mistaken thing
 
00:28:48.049 --> 00:28:48.059 align:start position:0%
that you were Madam chair but I did not
 
00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:52.400 align:start position:0%
realize that there although there is no
 
00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:54.900 align:start position:0%
pre-deprivation hearing
 
00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
um or at least may not they may not be
 
00:28:58.490 --> 00:28:58.500 align:start position:0%
in in the circumstances that Ms
 
00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
Rosenberg uh mentioned there it the I'm
 
00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:04.980 align:start position:0%
satisfied from what this what the
 
00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
department have said is that there will
 
00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:08.700 align:start position:0%
not be
 
00:29:11.269 --> 00:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
the person will not be left homeless so
 
00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:13.620 align:start position:0%
there is a post deprivation hearing that
 
00:29:15.409 --> 00:29:15.419 align:start position:0%
is guaranteed
 
00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:19.500 align:start position:0%
um and the uh the the person also in
 
00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
that interim time is not going to be
 
00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:25.020 align:start position:0%
left homeless and I think that while
 
00:29:27.649 --> 00:29:27.659 align:start position:0%
that is that may not be exactly the same
 
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
as would be the the case under the
 
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
state's landlord tenant law it it seems
 
00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:35.460 align:start position:0%
to me that it is comparable and and the
 
00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
other thing that I would point out is it
 
00:29:39.049 --> 00:29:39.059 align:start position:0%
seems to me that in both the landlord
 
00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:42.740 align:start position:0%
tenant scenario and this scenario
 
00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
the the alternative for for the the
 
00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
owner of the property of ins in a
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
situation that really becomes an
 
00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:52.380 align:start position:0%
emergency is to call the police and have
 
00:29:54.409 --> 00:29:54.419 align:start position:0%
the person arrested and it seems to me
 
00:29:57.909 --> 00:29:57.919 align:start position:0%
that particularly in this circumstance
 
00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
that's something that should be avoided
 
00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:04.500 align:start position:0%
if if it if at all possible and uh it
 
00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:07.260 align:start position:0%
seems to me that that the the way the
 
00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
the option that is is provided under the
 
00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:13.020 align:start position:0%
regulation as proposed that is you have
 
00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:15.240 align:start position:0%
to leave but we're not going to leave
 
00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:16.860 align:start position:0%
you homeless and you will get a post
 
00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:20.820 align:start position:0%
deprivation hearing uh tens to tends to
 
00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:22.740 align:start position:0%
provide an alternative that will not be
 
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
result in the person being arrested
 
00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:26.580 align:start position:0%
which I think is is kind of in
 
00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
everybody's interest so for those
 
00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:29.820 align:start position:0%
reasons while I understand Ms
 
00:30:33.049 --> 00:30:33.059 align:start position:0%
rosenberg's concern and and uh it's
 
00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:35.820 align:start position:0%
certainly a well taken concern I I I'm
 
00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
satisfied with the state with the
 
00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
Department's response so that's why I
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
support it
 
00:30:42.409 --> 00:30:42.419 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt or representative
 
00:30:48.289 --> 00:30:48.299 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair well again we're
 
00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
talking about a difficult situation here
 
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
right where we're trying to balance
 
00:30:57.289 --> 00:30:57.299 align:start position:0%
risks to both parties uh rights of both
 
00:30:59.690 --> 00:30:59.700 align:start position:0%
parties and so forth uh and I think this
 
00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
is a reasonable uh modality on the part
 
00:31:06.789 --> 00:31:06.799 align:start position:0%
of the department to try to get again
 
00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:09.480 align:start position:0%
something that seems reasonable and
 
00:31:11.389 --> 00:31:11.399 align:start position:0%
we'll have to see whether uh whether
 
00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:14.580 align:start position:0%
this does the trick so I I think we need
 
00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:17.460 align:start position:0%
to move forward at this point
 
00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:19.789 align:start position:0%
to move forward at this point
representative

00:31:19.789 --> 00:31:19.799 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
I am concerned about this because
 
00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
um it says ensure that the resident has
 
00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:28.559 align:start position:0%
access to an alternative safe residence
 
00:31:28.559 --> 00:31:30.590 align:start position:0%
access to an alternative safe residence
but

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
who defines and who understands what the
 
00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
safe residence is who determines that
 
00:31:39.049 --> 00:31:39.059 align:start position:0%
the department what if the person
 
00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:40.740 align:start position:0%
doesn't feel safe in that environment
 
00:31:42.769 --> 00:31:42.779 align:start position:0%
feel safe in their previous environment
 
00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:44.580 align:start position:0%
so I don't know how to
 
00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
we can't Define it more than that but
 
00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:53.940 align:start position:0%
maybe you can help me with that
 
00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to so in that provision
 
00:31:57.889 --> 00:31:57.899 align:start position:0%
where it calls for the service
 
00:31:59.870 --> 00:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
coordinator to convene a team meeting
 
00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:02.940 align:start position:0%
the individual that is affected by this
 
00:32:04.669 --> 00:32:04.679 align:start position:0%
is part of that team if they had a
 
00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
guardian they would be part of that team
 
00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
their service coordinator and all of
 
00:32:10.909 --> 00:32:10.919 align:start position:0%
their providers that are appropriate
 
00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
would be there so it would be a decision
 
00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
that is reached jointly
 
00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
okay and where would I find that
 
00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:19.140 align:start position:0%
so the members of the that the
 
00:32:21.049 --> 00:32:21.059 align:start position:0%
individual is part of the team or their
 
00:32:23.269 --> 00:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
Guardian is so it says a service
 
00:32:24.889 --> 00:32:24.899 align:start position:0%
coordinator or designee immediately
 
00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
convenes a team meeting
 
00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:29.460 align:start position:0%
um that would be the individual would be
 
00:32:31.549 --> 00:32:31.559 align:start position:0%
part of that they're part of the team I
 
00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:32.820 align:start position:0%
guess it's not you won't find a
 
00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:34.980 align:start position:0%
definition in this rule of what team is
 
00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
okay um but it I think that to the
 
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:40.260 align:start position:0%
individuals with all the other rights
 
00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:41.340 align:start position:0%
that are explained to them I think it
 
00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:43.500 align:start position:0%
would be known to them who the members
 
00:32:45.289 --> 00:32:45.299 align:start position:0%
of the team are and and in any service
 
00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
planning meeting it's a requirement um
 
00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:50.220 align:start position:0%
based on other rules that the individual
 
00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:52.799 align:start position:0%
be there and in fact they are the uh
 
00:32:54.649 --> 00:32:54.659 align:start position:0%
this is an individual driven Service
 
00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
delivery system so they would be driving
 
00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
those conversations in large part
 
00:33:03.529 --> 00:33:03.539 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I I'm satisfied okay any
 
00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
other comments or questions
 
00:33:06.889 --> 00:33:06.899 align:start position:0%
representative Leon
 
00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair
 
00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:10.860 align:start position:0%
um I I just want to refresh my
 
00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
understanding of that this this is
 
00:33:14.509 --> 00:33:14.519 align:start position:0%
situations where these people are housed
 
00:33:17.149 --> 00:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
with other people with similar similar
 
00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:19.260 align:start position:0%
needs and so it's a shared living
 
00:33:21.649 --> 00:33:21.659 align:start position:0%
arrangement in some way yes that's
 
00:33:24.889 --> 00:33:24.899 align:start position:0%
correct thank you given that and given
 
00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:26.580 align:start position:0%
the balance of the rights of both these
 
00:33:28.009 --> 00:33:28.019 align:start position:0%
people and those others who are living
 
00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
with them I'd love to have more
 
00:33:31.909 --> 00:33:31.919 align:start position:0%
solutions but I think right now this
 
00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
makes sense to move forward okay thank
 
00:33:36.769 --> 00:33:36.779 align:start position:0%
you anyone else
 
00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
in favor
 
00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:41.630 align:start position:0%
in favor
aye opposed

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:41.640 align:start position:0%
aye opposed
 
00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:44.220 align:start position:0%
all right thank you represent Senator
 
00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:46.260 align:start position:0%
Ward as voted no
 
00:33:49.789 --> 00:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:52.909 --> 00:33:52.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:01.860 align:start position:0%
okay um 2022 159 the driver license
 
00:34:04.669 --> 00:34:04.679 align:start position:0%
rules um the proposed rules provide
 
00:34:07.009 --> 00:34:07.019 align:start position:0%
procedures and licensing requirements
 
00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
for the issuance of all classes of
 
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
driver's license and non-driver
 
00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
identification cards the rules in the
 
00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:15.780 align:start position:0%
forms are being amended to address some
 
00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
recent statutory changes and program
 
00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:20.220 align:start position:0%
changes a conditional approval request
 
00:34:23.629 --> 00:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
has been filed and there are only two
 
00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:25.740 align:start position:0%
issues remaining in the rule although
 
00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:27.540 align:start position:0%
you'll see a lot of comments throughout
 
00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:30.780 align:start position:0%
but those are around the forms so I'll
 
00:34:33.290 --> 00:34:33.300 align:start position:0%
take the easier the two topics to deal
 
00:34:37.369 --> 00:34:37.379 align:start position:0%
with first and that would be on page 52
 
00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:40.740 align:start position:0%
of the conditional approval request
 
00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:41.409 align:start position:0%
of the conditional approval request
um

00:34:41.409 --> 00:34:41.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
here that section is about false
 
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
statements made during an official
 
00:34:49.329 --> 00:34:49.339 align:start position:0%
proceeding and the scope of the hearing
 
00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
about the respondent's false statement
 
00:34:54.589 --> 00:34:54.599 align:start position:0%
the rule says that the scope of the
 
00:34:56.930 --> 00:34:56.940 align:start position:0%
hearing will determine whether the
 
00:34:58.849 --> 00:34:58.859 align:start position:0%
respondent's false statement was made
 
00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:00.780 align:start position:0%
because the person reasonably felt
 
00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:01.910 align:start position:0%
because the person reasonably felt
coerced

00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
coerced
 
00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
into making the statement or whether
 
00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:06.300 align:start position:0%
they reasonably believed the false
 
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
statement was true
 
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
and you can see I've flagged the word
 
00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:12.900 align:start position:0%
reasonably and it is a legal standard
 
00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:15.060 align:start position:0%
the department says that the hearing
 
00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
officer will most likely use the legal
 
00:35:19.089 --> 00:35:19.099 align:start position:0%
standard when determining reasonableness
 
00:35:21.829 --> 00:35:21.839 align:start position:0%
but they don't want to Define it here in
 
00:35:24.109 --> 00:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
the rule because they're concerned about
 
00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:27.420 align:start position:0%
some unintended consequences and I think
 
00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
that's understandable because it's
 
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
probably going to involve some case law
 
00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:32.089 align:start position:0%
probably going to involve some case law
and

00:35:32.089 --> 00:35:32.099 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:35.820 align:start position:0%
um you know so that application so they
 
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
it makes sense to me not to Define it
 
00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:40.740 align:start position:0%
here but you may have some questions to
 
00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:42.660 align:start position:0%
ask the agency before I get into the
 
00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:46.020 align:start position:0%
bigger issue around the forms are there
 
00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:52.069 --> 00:35:52.079 align:start position:0%
I don't see any so let's dive into the
 
00:35:55.069 --> 00:35:55.079 align:start position:0%
mess in the form sure so
 
00:35:56.569 --> 00:35:56.579 align:start position:0%
um like I said this is going to cover
 
00:35:58.670 --> 00:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
the rest of the comments made throughout
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
the rule and I'm going to talk about
 
00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:03.839 align:start position:0%
this at a very high level so in February
 
00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:06.540 align:start position:0%
of last year the department was asked by
 
00:36:08.569 --> 00:36:08.579 align:start position:0%
the committee to develop a policy around
 
00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:10.380 align:start position:0%
making sure that their forms were
 
00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:13.140 align:start position:0%
updated or not updated outside of the
 
00:36:15.829 --> 00:36:15.839 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process because at that time
 
00:36:18.109 --> 00:36:18.119 align:start position:0%
they had a proposal that had some forms
 
00:36:20.569 --> 00:36:20.579 align:start position:0%
that were updated outside of formal
 
00:36:20.579 --> 00:36:21.829 align:start position:0%
that were updated outside of formal
roommaking

00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
roommaking
 
00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:24.300 align:start position:0%
so the department did enact that policy
 
00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
but there are forms in this proposal
 
00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:28.740 align:start position:0%
that updates were made outside of
 
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
rulemaking and that was prior to the
 
00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:32.940 align:start position:0%
implementation of this policy
 
00:36:35.690 --> 00:36:35.700 align:start position:0%
so as the department brings proposals
 
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
forward we may encounter this issue
 
00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:39.829 align:start position:0%
forward we may encounter this issue
again

00:36:39.829 --> 00:36:39.839 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:36:39.839 --> 00:36:41.150 align:start position:0%
again
so

00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
um the proposals there are a lot of
 
00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
forms in in the proposal and I wasn't
 
00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:48.660 align:start position:0%
going to go through each one since we
 
00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:51.180 align:start position:0%
have a lot on the agenda today there are
 
00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
12 forms in the proposal and they all
 
00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:55.140 align:start position:0%
had amendments outside of rulemaking
 
00:36:58.069 --> 00:36:58.079 align:start position:0%
most were editorial there were only two
 
00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
that had substantive changes and those
 
00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:03.599 align:start position:0%
changes were around the insertion of
 
00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:06.780 align:start position:0%
real ID requirements additionally there
 
00:37:09.109 --> 00:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
are two forms that had some requirements
 
00:37:11.329 --> 00:37:11.339 align:start position:0%
incorporated into interim rules and then
 
00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:13.380 align:start position:0%
those interim rules expired
 
00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:15.720 align:start position:0%
but it looks like that only some of the
 
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
sections of the forms expired and not
 
00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:21.540 align:start position:0%
the entire form for example one of the
 
00:37:23.770 --> 00:37:23.780 align:start position:0%
forms included a certification statement
 
00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:26.220 align:start position:0%
and that was in the interim Rule and
 
00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:28.740 align:start position:0%
that expired another form had some
 
00:37:31.069 --> 00:37:31.079 align:start position:0%
questions about the individuals such as
 
00:37:34.609 --> 00:37:34.619 align:start position:0%
gender and physical attributes but those
 
00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:36.540 align:start position:0%
requirements are actually in the statute
 
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
so they're probably okay
 
00:37:41.569 --> 00:37:41.579 align:start position:0%
but anyway that's a high level view of
 
00:37:43.069 --> 00:37:43.079 align:start position:0%
the comments around the forums like I
 
00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:44.460 align:start position:0%
said it didn't want to go through each
 
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
and every one if the committee wants to
 
00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:48.839 align:start position:0%
do that we can but um but you may have
 
00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
some questions for the Department around
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
the policy of making sure that forms are
 
00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
only updated if they're going to be
 
00:37:56.930 --> 00:37:56.940 align:start position:0%
updated substantively through the the
 
00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:00.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
good morning I'm attorney Dave Hills
 
00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:07.980 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Safety
 
00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
um so as it's been explained we did
 
00:38:12.829 --> 00:38:12.839 align:start position:0%
enact the policy at the request of this
 
00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
committee to address
 
00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:19.020 align:start position:0%
the process of amending forms by the by
 
00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:21.660 align:start position:0%
the agency and as the community attorney
 
00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:22.970 align:start position:0%
the agency and as the community attorney
explained

00:38:22.970 --> 00:38:22.980 align:start position:0%
explained
 
00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:23.690 align:start position:0%
explained
um

00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:23.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
you know the the reality is is that this
 
00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
department has a lot of rules uh their
 
00:38:30.589 --> 00:38:30.599 align:start position:0%
10-year rules and so you know there's
 
00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:33.420 align:start position:0%
likely to be many examples that were
 
00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:36.540 align:start position:0%
committed in the past of having done the
 
00:38:38.089 --> 00:38:38.099 align:start position:0%
same activity and they're only going to
 
00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:40.740 align:start position:0%
keep coming to light as the rules have
 
00:38:42.290 --> 00:38:42.300 align:start position:0%
been brought forward
 
00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:45.300 align:start position:0%
um the decision has not been made
 
00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:48.180 align:start position:0%
um by the department to allocate
 
00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
resources to uh
 
00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:53.460 align:start position:0%
thoroughly go back and revisit every
 
00:38:56.990 --> 00:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
rule set they have to you know correct
 
00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.569 align:start position:0%
rule set they have to you know correct
this

00:38:59.569 --> 00:38:59.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:02.700 align:start position:0%
as a targeted exercise but basically as
 
00:39:04.849 --> 00:39:04.859 align:start position:0%
the rules Come forward for re-adoption
 
00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:07.500 align:start position:0%
that we would take care of this issue
 
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
um you know otherwise the department
 
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
intends to you know implement the policy
 
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.130 align:start position:0%
intends to you know implement the policy
that

00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:13.140 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:15.180 align:start position:0%
um that we enacted at the committee's
 
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:21.900 align:start position:0%
I am absolutely shocked and it took you
 
00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
until 2022 to realize that your forms
 
00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:27.780 align:start position:0%
are rules and they have the effect of
 
00:39:30.050 --> 00:39:30.060 align:start position:0%
Law and did you ought to control who
 
00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
make can make changes to them this is
 
00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:34.380 align:start position:0%
not a new problem in the department of
 
00:39:36.410 --> 00:39:36.420 align:start position:0%
safety you've been making changes to
 
00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:38.940 align:start position:0%
those forms without
 
00:39:42.829 --> 00:39:42.839 align:start position:0%
without any controls for at least
 
00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:45.540 align:start position:0%
six seven years that I can remember and
 
00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:46.980 align:start position:0%
I'm not really involved with the
 
00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:49.020 align:start position:0%
department and I'm very disappointed
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
that you're now saying oh yes from now
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
on will be good because I frankly don't
 
00:40:00.109 --> 00:40:00.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:01.500 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any of the questions
 
00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:02.700 align:start position:0%
that you have
 
00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:03.829 align:start position:0%
that you have
okay

00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:13.260 align:start position:0%
okay yes representative Leon um thank
 
00:40:14.810 --> 00:40:14.820 align:start position:0%
you madam chair thank you for taking
 
00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
this question if there are forums that
 
00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
are found to be not consistent with
 
00:40:21.589 --> 00:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
current practice or not consistent with
 
00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:23.460 align:start position:0%
the underlying statutes how would those
 
00:40:25.069 --> 00:40:25.079 align:start position:0%
be brought forward in order to have a
 
00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
correction especially if those remain
 
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:33.349 --> 00:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
00:40:33.359 --> 00:40:35.750 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
um

00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
so taking this rulemaking as an example
 
00:40:41.810 --> 00:40:41.820 align:start position:0%
um you know when the 1000 rules came up
 
00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:43.740 align:start position:0%
for read option because they were due to
 
00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
expire in 2012.
 
00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:47.349 align:start position:0%
expire in 2012.
um

00:40:47.349 --> 00:40:47.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:51.839 align:start position:0%
reconciling forms to rules were part was
 
00:40:54.829 --> 00:40:54.839 align:start position:0%
part of the review of re-adopting the
 
00:40:58.430 --> 00:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
chapter and as I stated before it's not
 
00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:00.900 align:start position:0%
been the decision of the department to
 
00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
make a separate project of going back to
 
00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:06.300 align:start position:0%
I don't know how many rules we have like
 
00:41:08.089 --> 00:41:08.099 align:start position:0%
maybe 80
 
00:41:11.089 --> 00:41:11.099 align:start position:0%
um rule chapters to go back as a result
 
00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:14.460 align:start position:0%
of the implementation of the policy in
 
00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
February of last year to address all of
 
00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:19.640 align:start position:0%
these issues outside of the regular
 
00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:22.740 align:start position:0%
readoption of rules that we would as a
 
00:41:24.829 --> 00:41:24.839 align:start position:0%
resource allocation issue take care of
 
00:41:27.589 --> 00:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
this as the different chapters came up
 
00:41:29.329 --> 00:41:29.339 align:start position:0%
for read option I hope that answers your
 
00:41:32.089 --> 00:41:32.099 align:start position:0%
question I'd like to ask what controls
 
00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:34.500 align:start position:0%
do you have in place to ensure that
 
00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:37.260 align:start position:0%
going forward no form will ever be
 
00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
changed without going through rule
 
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
making so so the control that we have is
 
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
that we implemented the policy that was
 
00:41:46.069 --> 00:41:46.079 align:start position:0%
requested by the committee last year
 
00:41:48.290 --> 00:41:48.300 align:start position:0%
which was implemented in February of
 
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
2022. before that we did not have a
 
00:41:55.069 --> 00:41:55.079 align:start position:0%
policy and what does that policy do
 
00:41:57.109 --> 00:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
um I apologize that I don't have a copy
 
00:41:59.270 --> 00:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
of the policy with me it was provided to
 
00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
the committee when it was enacted to
 
00:42:03.349 --> 00:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that we complied with that
 
00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:06.300 align:start position:0%
to my recollection what the policy says
 
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
is that agency Personnel at the you know
 
00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
sort of lower uh levels that would be
 
00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
involved in rulemaking if they want to
 
00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:19.500 align:start position:0%
um make changes to the form that it goes
 
00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
to the legal unit in order to ensure
 
00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:23.270 align:start position:0%
to the legal unit in order to ensure
that

00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:42:24.829 --> 00:42:24.839 align:start position:0%
um you know whatever rulemaking is
 
00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:27.060 align:start position:0%
actually required you know by the change
 
00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:29.940 align:start position:0%
you know say for example it's not just a
 
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
rearrangement of of the information on
 
00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:34.260 align:start position:0%
the form without changing anything which
 
00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
would as I understand it'd be completely
 
00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:37.640 align:start position:0%
outside of rulemaking
 
00:42:39.829 --> 00:42:39.839 align:start position:0%
but to make sure that if there's any
 
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
changes that the agency wants to make
 
00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
that the legal unit would identify that
 
00:42:49.609 --> 00:42:49.619 align:start position:0%
any necessary rulemaking is is done
 
00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
see representative Leon and
 
00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:52.740 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn
 
00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:54.540 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair
 
00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:55.130 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair
um

00:42:55.130 --> 00:42:55.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:57.650 --> 00:42:57.660 align:start position:0%
I I do have some questions because last
 
00:42:59.930 --> 00:42:59.940 align:start position:0%
summer there were constituents who had
 
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
forms who were told that they needed to
 
00:43:03.829 --> 00:43:03.839 align:start position:0%
surrender the physical copy of their
 
00:43:05.690 --> 00:43:05.700 align:start position:0%
driver's license when they had a
 
00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
suspended license and they had a form
 
00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:09.900 align:start position:0%
from your department that said that that
 
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
needed to happen when they received it
 
00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:13.980 align:start position:0%
back from the court when the court told
 
00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
them that it was not necessary and they
 
00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:18.300 align:start position:0%
went to the DMV and conquered they were
 
00:43:20.089 --> 00:43:20.099 align:start position:0%
told by the people working the desk that
 
00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
that form was not correct and it wasn't
 
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
in force and don't worry it doesn't
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
actually matter what procedures do you
 
00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:28.140 align:start position:0%
have in place so that your Frontline
 
00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:30.540 align:start position:0%
employees may know that a forum is
 
00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
incorrect but uh the rulemaking body
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:39.230 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:41.030 align:start position:0%
yeah
lovely

00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
lovely
 
00:43:42.890 --> 00:43:42.900 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your question
 
00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:46.500 align:start position:0%
um I honestly don't have an answer for
 
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
you today on that I wasn't involved in
 
00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
that I feel like I should find out some
 
00:43:53.410 --> 00:43:53.420 align:start position:0%
information for you about
 
00:43:56.089 --> 00:43:56.099 align:start position:0%
that instance and then basically work
 
00:43:58.970 --> 00:43:58.980 align:start position:0%
from there about how the policy would
 
00:44:02.329 --> 00:44:02.339 align:start position:0%
apply to a situation like that and I can
 
00:44:03.770 --> 00:44:03.780 align:start position:0%
provide that information back to the
 
00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:04.790 align:start position:0%
provide that information back to the
committee

00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:07.140 align:start position:0%
thank you please do representative Lynn
 
00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:08.700 align:start position:0%
yeah I wonder if I could just follow up
 
00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
and I and I recognized that this may
 
00:44:13.069 --> 00:44:13.079 align:start position:0%
that you know I'm I'm sort of this is
 
00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:15.060 align:start position:0%
coming out of the blue in a sense and so
 
00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:16.380 align:start position:0%
you may not have an answer to this
 
00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:17.390 align:start position:0%
you may not have an answer to this
specific

00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:44:20.089 --> 00:44:20.099 align:start position:0%
but I'm just wondering when if
 
00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
when you say you didn't go you know the
 
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
department hasn't sort of gone back to
 
00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:25.430 align:start position:0%
department hasn't sort of gone back to
make

00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
make
 
00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
to kind of redo things that forms that
 
00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
are maybe in existence from the past the
 
00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:33.780 align:start position:0%
where there hasn't been some particular
 
00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:36.180 align:start position:0%
reason to do so
 
00:44:38.329 --> 00:44:38.339 align:start position:0%
I assume that if
 
00:44:42.730 --> 00:44:42.740 align:start position:0%
if a court has said there's a problem
 
00:44:47.329 --> 00:44:47.339 align:start position:0%
with either a regulation or a form uh
 
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
and it's and it's invalid or needs to be
 
00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:52.020 align:start position:0%
changed for one reason or another I
 
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
assume I assume that the department then
 
00:44:56.930 --> 00:44:56.940 align:start position:0%
makes the change
 
00:44:58.490 --> 00:44:58.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
00:45:01.069 --> 00:45:01.079 align:start position:0%
um I don't have knowledge of a of an
 
00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:03.240 align:start position:0%
instance of when a court has issued an
 
00:45:05.569 --> 00:45:05.579 align:start position:0%
order to that effect so that we would
 
00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
need to comply with it but it's my
 
00:45:10.069 --> 00:45:10.079 align:start position:0%
belief that if we were the recipient of
 
00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
a court order that explicitly said
 
00:45:13.609 --> 00:45:13.619 align:start position:0%
something like that that we would
 
00:45:15.589 --> 00:45:15.599 align:start position:0%
implement the Court's order okay well
 
00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:17.640 align:start position:0%
let me then let me be specific and maybe
 
00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:18.900 align:start position:0%
if you're you know while you're checking
 
00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
on things maybe you could sort of check
 
00:45:22.609 --> 00:45:22.619 align:start position:0%
it I can recall and this is this
 
00:45:24.530 --> 00:45:24.540 align:start position:0%
actually goes back a number of years now
 
00:45:28.370 --> 00:45:28.380 align:start position:0%
but sometime within say the last
 
00:45:30.829 --> 00:45:30.839 align:start position:0%
10 years maybe maybe less than that it
 
00:45:32.210 --> 00:45:32.220 align:start position:0%
may be eight years
 
00:45:34.490 --> 00:45:34.500 align:start position:0%
the the Supreme Court issued a decision
 
00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:36.920 align:start position:0%
saying that the Departments
 
00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:40.140 align:start position:0%
rules and form regarding
 
00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:43.140 align:start position:0%
when someone who was from out of state
 
00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
but wanted to get a um wanted to get a
 
00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:50.220 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire pistol permit
 
00:45:51.890 --> 00:45:51.900 align:start position:0%
um which although it's not required
 
00:45:54.609 --> 00:45:54.619 align:start position:0%
still is an available thing
 
00:45:57.349 --> 00:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court said that the that the
 
00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
Department's rules and the forms that
 
00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
they were using were invalid
 
00:46:03.890 --> 00:46:03.900 align:start position:0%
um and they did not comply with New
 
00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:05.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law
 
00:46:08.210 --> 00:46:08.220 align:start position:0%
and and reversed and that was a this was
 
00:46:09.890 --> 00:46:09.900 align:start position:0%
a person from New Jersey who had applied
 
00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:13.020 align:start position:0%
the court reversed the Department's
 
00:46:15.410 --> 00:46:15.420 align:start position:0%
denial of his permit and I'm just
 
00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:18.060 align:start position:0%
wondering whether or not that um
 
00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:21.180 align:start position:0%
the department changed its rules and uh
 
00:46:23.690 --> 00:46:23.700 align:start position:0%
and forms in response to that and so if
 
00:46:24.829 --> 00:46:24.839 align:start position:0%
you know if you're going to be checking
 
00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:26.220 align:start position:0%
on other things I wonder if you could
 
00:46:29.569 --> 00:46:29.579 align:start position:0%
check on that and let us know
 
00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
I will definitely thank you you're
 
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.790 align:start position:0%
I will definitely thank you you're
welcome

00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
00:46:41.329 --> 00:46:41.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:49.490 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:49.500 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:57.170 --> 00:46:57.180 align:start position:0%
is it possible to make a motion to
 
00:46:59.329 --> 00:46:59.339 align:start position:0%
conditionally approve with the
 
00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:01.140 align:start position:0%
understanding that the answer is there
 
00:47:03.050 --> 00:47:03.060 align:start position:0%
the questions that we have today will be
 
00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:04.970 align:start position:0%
the questions that we have today will be
answered

00:47:04.970 --> 00:47:04.980 align:start position:0%
answered
 
00:47:07.069 --> 00:47:07.079 align:start position:0%
yes certainly yes
 
00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
yeah they have filed the conditional
 
00:47:11.329 --> 00:47:11.339 align:start position:0%
approval request and um in the letter I
 
00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:13.140 align:start position:0%
can include that
 
00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:15.060 align:start position:0%
um that they want that the committee
 
00:47:18.050 --> 00:47:18.060 align:start position:0%
wants to report back on those issues
 
00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:25.390 align:start position:0%
wants to report back on those issues
yes

00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:25.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:28.970 --> 00:47:28.980 align:start position:0%
any further discussion I'm
 
00:47:30.829 --> 00:47:30.839 align:start position:0%
with that motion my understanding is
 
00:47:33.109 --> 00:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
that this will be at the next meeting on
 
00:47:34.609 --> 00:47:34.619 align:start position:0%
the agenda the next meeting and that
 
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
information that report will be given to
 
00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
us by then
 
00:47:40.910 --> 00:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
well they have a what 30 days to return
 
00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
their conditional approval response and
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
so it wouldn't necessarily be on the
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
next agenda but we should receive their
 
00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
response in their letter probably before
 
00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:53.640 align:start position:0%
the next agenda and so we can present
 
00:47:57.589 --> 00:47:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:59.450 --> 00:47:59.460 align:start position:0%
um representative groda with a
 
00:48:01.849 --> 00:48:01.859 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request if the
 
00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:04.140 align:start position:0%
committee approves it the agency then
 
00:48:07.010 --> 00:48:07.020 align:start position:0%
does a conditional approval response it
 
00:48:11.690 --> 00:48:11.700 align:start position:0%
goes only to staff and uh so long as the
 
00:48:15.109 --> 00:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
two documents are exactly the same then
 
00:48:17.450 --> 00:48:17.460 align:start position:0%
we tell the agency that they can go
 
00:48:20.089 --> 00:48:20.099 align:start position:0%
ahead and adopt if their response
 
00:48:22.849 --> 00:48:22.859 align:start position:0%
differs from substantively from the
 
00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
conditional approval requests then it's
 
00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:27.540 align:start position:0%
automatically becomes a preliminary
 
00:48:29.390 --> 00:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
objection and would come back to the
 
00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:30.410 align:start position:0%
objection and would come back to the
committee

00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:30.420 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:32.460 align:start position:0%
so then how do we address the caveat
 
00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:35.220 align:start position:0%
that I have that depends on the that we
 
00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:37.740 align:start position:0%
receive this report and that the report
 
00:48:40.849 --> 00:48:40.859 align:start position:0%
that we receive is one that we
 
00:48:43.569 --> 00:48:43.579 align:start position:0%
that addresses the concerns that we have
 
00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:46.260 align:start position:0%
based on the committee's motion the
 
00:48:48.290 --> 00:48:48.300 align:start position:0%
department would be obligated to come
 
00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
back and present a report on it but the
 
00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
rule would have already been taken care
 
00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:56.210 align:start position:0%
rule would have already been taken care
of

00:48:56.210 --> 00:48:56.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:58.430 --> 00:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
so I just want to make sure that the
 
00:49:00.050 --> 00:49:00.060 align:start position:0%
committee is comfortable with that so
 
00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:01.130 align:start position:0%
committee is comfortable with that so
yes

00:49:01.130 --> 00:49:01.140 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:03.720 align:start position:0%
that is our procedure Madam chairman
 
00:49:05.569 --> 00:49:05.579 align:start position:0%
attorney Hills yes oh thank you very
 
00:49:05.579 --> 00:49:06.290 align:start position:0%
attorney Hills yes oh thank you very
much

00:49:06.290 --> 00:49:06.300 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:49:09.410 --> 00:49:09.420 align:start position:0%
um I have um director John marasco from
 
00:49:13.069 --> 00:49:13.079 align:start position:0%
the DMV I'm here today and um if the
 
00:49:14.930 --> 00:49:14.940 align:start position:0%
committee believes it's you know proper
 
00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:17.240 align:start position:0%
he'd like to make a statement about
 
00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
what's been discussed here today
 
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh I'm delighted to hear from because
 
00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
that's relevant to these rules I however
 
00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
have broad concerns about forms
 
00:49:31.130 --> 00:49:31.140 align:start position:0%
throughout the department of safety and
 
00:49:32.809 --> 00:49:32.819 align:start position:0%
how they are controlled but I'd love to
 
00:49:37.370 --> 00:49:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:39.530 --> 00:49:39.540 align:start position:0%
seeing that's where most people get to
 
00:49:41.809 --> 00:49:41.819 align:start position:0%
interface with the Department of Safety
 
00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:43.740 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair members of the
 
00:49:44.870 --> 00:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
committee thank you so much for giving
 
00:49:46.609 --> 00:49:46.619 align:start position:0%
me just a moment here
 
00:49:48.490 --> 00:49:48.500 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to thank attorney hilts and
 
00:49:50.510 --> 00:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
administrator Mike Mercier for being
 
00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:52.020 align:start position:0%
here this morning
 
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
um so I've been in this position for
 
00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
approximately 15 months and I'm
 
00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
listening to the conversation here and I
 
00:49:58.910 --> 00:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
just wanted to get to this table for a
 
00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
minute when I came in 15 months ago one
 
00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:03.900 align:start position:0%
of the things I learned when I first
 
00:50:05.930 --> 00:50:05.940 align:start position:0%
became the DMV director was the
 
00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
importance of the rule sets that we have
 
00:50:11.210 --> 00:50:11.220 align:start position:0%
that govern the agency we have many of
 
00:50:13.609 --> 00:50:13.619 align:start position:0%
them they're very complex and I learned
 
00:50:16.370 --> 00:50:16.380 align:start position:0%
very quickly that that is law
 
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
whatever is in the rule is law period so
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
any changes to forms any changes at all
 
00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
need to go through this committee and so
 
00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
what I want you to know is right up
 
00:50:29.809 --> 00:50:29.819 align:start position:0%
front I fully understand that respect
 
00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
that and we're going to conform to that
 
00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:33.290 align:start position:0%
that and we're going to conform to that
um

00:50:33.290 --> 00:50:33.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
any rule changes or or changes to forms
 
00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:38.700 align:start position:0%
in the last 15 months the only changes
 
00:50:40.849 --> 00:50:40.859 align:start position:0%
that have happened under my tenure there
 
00:50:44.089 --> 00:50:44.099 align:start position:0%
have been the name change at the top of
 
00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:46.020 align:start position:0%
the document which we did run through
 
00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:47.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety legal
 
00:50:50.569 --> 00:50:50.579 align:start position:0%
because it's not a substantial change to
 
00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:52.740 align:start position:0%
information in the document but it
 
00:50:54.290 --> 00:50:54.300 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense to continue putting
 
00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
out correspondence to the public that
 
00:50:57.240 --> 00:50:58.569 align:start position:0%
out correspondence to the public that
has

00:50:58.569 --> 00:50:58.579 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
passed information or outdated
 
00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
information on it
 
00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:05.640 align:start position:0%
as far as moving forward
 
00:51:08.809 --> 00:51:08.819 align:start position:0%
what I can tell you is that from a
 
00:51:11.569 --> 00:51:11.579 align:start position:0%
training standpoint we are working very
 
00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:13.980 align:start position:0%
hard in the division to get to a level
 
00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
of gold uh standard training and
 
00:51:18.349 --> 00:51:18.359 align:start position:0%
actually I'll share with the committee I
 
00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
just had a conversation with
 
00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:22.260 align:start position:0%
um a representative from amva the
 
00:51:23.809 --> 00:51:23.819 align:start position:0%
American Association of Motor Vehicle
 
00:51:26.210 --> 00:51:26.220 align:start position:0%
administrators late last night and on
 
00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
July 31st AMV is actually coming to New
 
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as part of a pilot program to
 
00:51:35.569 --> 00:51:35.579 align:start position:0%
train up to 100 DMV employees on what
 
00:51:38.569 --> 00:51:38.579 align:start position:0%
anva offers best practices standards as
 
00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
well as leadership training for
 
00:51:42.109 --> 00:51:42.119 align:start position:0%
hopefully all of our leaders within the
 
00:51:44.809 --> 00:51:44.819 align:start position:0%
organization there's a pilot program for
 
00:51:46.069 --> 00:51:46.079 align:start position:0%
amva they're starting with New Hampshire
 
00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
because we we asked if we could partner
 
00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
with them that's the type of training
 
00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
that we're bringing in so I just want to
 
00:51:54.049 --> 00:51:54.059 align:start position:0%
let you know that we're going to be
 
00:51:56.930 --> 00:51:56.940 align:start position:0%
focused on uniform messaging at all of
 
00:51:58.970 --> 00:51:58.980 align:start position:0%
our counters around the state we have 14
 
00:52:01.970 --> 00:52:01.980 align:start position:0%
locations approximately 60 counters a
 
00:52:03.770 --> 00:52:03.780 align:start position:0%
lot of employees and that's got to be
 
00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:05.220 align:start position:0%
tightened up and we have been working on
 
00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
that the other thing is with DMV forms
 
00:52:10.130 --> 00:52:10.140 align:start position:0%
and Waters I also identified when I
 
00:52:12.349 --> 00:52:12.359 align:start position:0%
first came in that many of them the
 
00:52:14.809 --> 00:52:14.819 align:start position:0%
terminology is not clear we have a lot
 
00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
of we get roughly 400 000 phone calls a
 
00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:19.140 align:start position:0%
year that come into the agency many of
 
00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
those are generated because of our
 
00:52:23.569 --> 00:52:23.579 align:start position:0%
letters and forms they go out people
 
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
don't understand what they mean they're
 
00:52:27.829 --> 00:52:27.839 align:start position:0%
not grammatically correct so
 
00:52:31.010 --> 00:52:31.020 align:start position:0%
we had talked about uh and we we had one
 
00:52:32.930 --> 00:52:32.940 align:start position:0%
about a year ago within the organization
 
00:52:35.569 --> 00:52:35.579 align:start position:0%
a small Committee of employees that were
 
00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:37.800 align:start position:0%
actually working to update our forms and
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
review our letters but with the tasks
 
00:52:41.329 --> 00:52:41.339 align:start position:0%
that we have there and the complex
 
00:52:44.030 --> 00:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
operation it falls off and then it comes
 
00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:45.960 align:start position:0%
back we actually just this week had a
 
00:52:47.930 --> 00:52:47.940 align:start position:0%
conversation about a part-time program
 
00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
specialist three position that would be
 
00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
able to do that review DMV policies get
 
00:52:54.650 --> 00:52:54.660 align:start position:0%
them to where they need to be and review
 
00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
all of our letters and forms and make
 
00:52:58.690 --> 00:52:58.700 align:start position:0%
sure that they're where they need to be
 
00:53:01.130 --> 00:53:01.140 align:start position:0%
so those are those are some of the
 
00:53:02.450 --> 00:53:02.460 align:start position:0%
things that we're working on internally
 
00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
I just wanted you to hear that what I
 
00:53:07.609 --> 00:53:07.619 align:start position:0%
can assure you is this that during my
 
00:53:10.069 --> 00:53:10.079 align:start position:0%
time as the MV director there will be no
 
00:53:13.609 --> 00:53:13.619 align:start position:0%
changes to any forms or anything that
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
would violate the rule set that would
 
00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
need to go through jail car it will not
 
00:53:19.549 --> 00:53:19.559 align:start position:0%
happen it will not happen in I
 
00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:21.540 align:start position:0%
appreciate attorney hilts shouldering
 
00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
this and trying to get everything over
 
00:53:25.609 --> 00:53:25.619 align:start position:0%
the finish line and and representative
 
00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:27.660 align:start position:0%
Lynn if you'd like we will do a deep
 
00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
dive we will do a deep dive on other
 
00:53:31.730 --> 00:53:31.740 align:start position:0%
forums that might be out there we'll put
 
00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:33.180 align:start position:0%
together a committee of employees work
 
00:53:35.390 --> 00:53:35.400 align:start position:0%
with DOs legal and we'll find out other
 
00:53:37.190 --> 00:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
forms that need to be brought forward to
 
00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
this committee well before the 10-year
 
00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
Mark whatever you need us to do we'll do
 
00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:42.230 align:start position:0%
Mark whatever you need us to do we'll do
it

00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:53:44.030 --> 00:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions thank
 
00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
you are there any questions
 
00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
representative Leon um thank you madam
 
00:53:48.710 --> 00:53:48.720 align:start position:0%

00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:49.549 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you director for being
here

00:53:49.549 --> 00:53:49.559 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:51.240 align:start position:0%
um when a person has a suspended license
 
00:53:54.109 --> 00:53:54.119 align:start position:0%
do they need to surrender that copy of
 
00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
their license that they hold within five
 
00:53:58.549 --> 00:53:58.559 align:start position:0%
days of having that license suspended so
 
00:54:00.609 --> 00:54:00.619 align:start position:0%
this has come up and I I am going to ask
 
00:54:03.530 --> 00:54:03.540 align:start position:0%
administrator mercio to field that
 
00:54:05.450 --> 00:54:05.460 align:start position:0%
question it came to my attention several
 
00:54:06.349 --> 00:54:06.359 align:start position:0%
months ago through financial
 
00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility that licenses were still
 
00:54:13.309 --> 00:54:13.319 align:start position:0%
being sent in and yet we weren't uh
 
00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
anticipating that and didn't need them
 
00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:16.980 align:start position:0%
any longer and I I do want to if I could
 
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
defer to Mike that's right we don't we
 
00:54:21.589 --> 00:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
don't need the licenses we should not be
 
00:54:23.690 --> 00:54:23.700 align:start position:0%
receiving the licenses okay thank you
 
00:54:25.609 --> 00:54:25.619 align:start position:0%
then there's uh error in the rules that
 
00:54:27.470 --> 00:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
have been submitted because
 
00:54:34.430 --> 00:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
um on page 53 on on rule 10 16 15.
 
00:54:36.530 --> 00:54:36.540 align:start position:0%
um it speaks about how if the person has
 
00:54:39.230 --> 00:54:39.240 align:start position:0%
failed or refuse to comply with um the
 
00:54:41.329 --> 00:54:41.339 align:start position:0%
order to mail or deliver the suspended
 
00:54:43.130 --> 00:54:43.140 align:start position:0%
or revoked item to the department within
 
00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:45.480 align:start position:0%
five working days basically that they
 
00:54:48.829 --> 00:54:48.839 align:start position:0%
won't be getting their license back
 
00:54:51.290 --> 00:54:51.300 align:start position:0%
so if there is no need to surrender then
 
00:54:54.049 --> 00:54:54.059 align:start position:0%
this is an error in the rules that we
 
00:54:56.510 --> 00:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
are looking to approve
 
00:54:59.030 --> 00:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
thank you um could you cite the rule uh
 
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
section for me please the section is
 
00:55:04.490 --> 00:55:04.500 align:start position:0%
1016.15. refuse a little surrender
 
00:55:11.450 --> 00:55:11.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:13.250 --> 00:55:13.260 align:start position:0%
because the forums state that it needs
 
00:55:14.990 --> 00:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
to be returned within five working days
 
00:55:17.809 --> 00:55:17.819 align:start position:0%
and it does not specify any orders thank
 
00:55:17.819 --> 00:55:25.609 align:start position:0%
and it does not specify any orders thank
you

00:55:25.609 --> 00:55:25.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:28.130 --> 00:55:28.140 align:start position:0%
so minimum chair based on that I'd like
 
00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:30.589 align:start position:0%
so minimum chair based on that I'd like
to

00:55:30.589 --> 00:55:30.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
we didn't we didn't vote on the motion
 
00:55:35.690 --> 00:55:35.700 align:start position:0%
right to have haven't had a motion I
 
00:55:37.970 --> 00:55:37.980 align:start position:0%
thought we had a motion oh yes with
 
00:55:39.770 --> 00:55:39.780 align:start position:0%
that's what I'd like to withdraw my
 
00:55:41.630 --> 00:55:41.640 align:start position:0%
motion because I don't want to
 
00:55:43.250 --> 00:55:43.260 align:start position:0%
conditionally improve something that's
 
00:55:46.010 --> 00:55:46.020 align:start position:0%
got an error in it
 
00:55:52.250 --> 00:55:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:55.010 --> 00:55:55.020 align:start position:0%
require representative Lynn to withdraw
 
00:55:57.230 --> 00:55:57.240 align:start position:0%
a second if he wanted to so you're
 
00:55:59.809 --> 00:55:59.819 align:start position:0%
withdrawing your motion entirely
 
00:56:02.210 --> 00:56:02.220 align:start position:0%
okay could I just raise one question I
 
00:56:04.010 --> 00:56:04.020 align:start position:0%
want I want to make sure that
 
00:56:06.410 --> 00:56:06.420 align:start position:0%
that I'm
 
00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
that I'm understanding is correct that's
 
00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
the it
 
00:56:13.010 --> 00:56:13.020 align:start position:0%
it sounded like
 
00:56:16.089 --> 00:56:16.099 align:start position:0%
the rule that the section you read said
 
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
if the person doesn't
 
00:56:22.730 --> 00:56:22.740 align:start position:0%
comply with a request to surrender the
 
00:56:24.650 --> 00:56:24.660 align:start position:0%
license then certain bad things happen
 
00:56:26.690 --> 00:56:26.700 align:start position:0%
and I guess what I'm wondering is is
 
00:56:29.030 --> 00:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
that really
 
00:56:31.569 --> 00:56:31.579 align:start position:0%
if I'm understanding what was just said
 
00:56:34.849 --> 00:56:34.859 align:start position:0%
that really may not be inconsistent with
 
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
what was just said in the sense that if
 
00:56:39.710 --> 00:56:39.720 align:start position:0%
the state is no longer saying you have
 
00:56:41.930 --> 00:56:41.940 align:start position:0%
to submit you have to surrender your
 
00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
license then that provision may be
 
00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
superb Superfluous but it's not sort of
 
00:56:50.809 --> 00:56:50.819 align:start position:0%
wrong that's that's am I correct on that
 
00:56:52.549 --> 00:56:52.559 align:start position:0%
in other words if the if the department
 
00:56:55.130 --> 00:56:55.140 align:start position:0%
is simply not going to be saying asking
 
00:56:56.990 --> 00:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
people surrender the physical license
 
00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.849 align:start position:0%
people surrender the physical license
then

00:56:58.849 --> 00:56:58.859 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:57:00.770 --> 00:57:00.780 align:start position:0%
that provision might
 
00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
you know maybe it's unnecessary but I'm
 
00:57:04.670 --> 00:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
not sure that it's wrong
 
00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
no I'm sure yes I was going to ask the
 
00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
same Quest or or make the same comment
 
00:57:14.210 --> 00:57:14.220 align:start position:0%
as uh representative Lynn it does seem
 
00:57:16.130 --> 00:57:16.140 align:start position:0%
to me that it isn't saying that this
 
00:57:18.829 --> 00:57:18.839 align:start position:0%
will happen it's saying if something is
 
00:57:21.530 --> 00:57:21.540 align:start position:0%
required and doesn't happen
 
00:57:26.210 --> 00:57:26.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:28.490 --> 00:57:28.500 align:start position:0%
what is the citation again
 
00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:32.640 align:start position:0%
it's on page 54 and it's 10 16.15
 
00:57:36.349 --> 00:57:36.359 align:start position:0%
refusal to surrender articles ended
 
00:57:39.470 --> 00:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
section c one and two I believe
 
00:57:45.730 --> 00:57:45.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:47.870 --> 00:57:47.880 align:start position:0%
that that seems like a correct
 
00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:49.430 align:start position:0%
that that seems like a correct
interpretation

00:57:49.430 --> 00:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
interpretation
 
00:57:52.250 --> 00:57:52.260 align:start position:0%
um because an a uh it's talking about a
 
00:57:54.049 --> 00:57:54.059 align:start position:0%
person's failure to refuse to comply
 
00:57:57.470 --> 00:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
with an order to return so if the order
 
00:57:59.630 --> 00:57:59.640 align:start position:0%
is not given then the trigger won't
 
00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:01.430 align:start position:0%
is not given then the trigger won't
happen

00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:58:04.750 --> 00:58:04.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Leon
 
00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:58:09.589 --> 00:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
I still remain concerned because I had a
 
00:58:11.150 --> 00:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
constituent who was told by the courts
 
00:58:12.589 --> 00:58:12.599 align:start position:0%
that they needed to return it and then
 
00:58:14.510 --> 00:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
the DMV told them that they was not
 
00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:15.589 align:start position:0%
the DMV told them that they was not
necessary

00:58:15.589 --> 00:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:58:18.349 --> 00:58:18.359 align:start position:0%
I'm just concerned about the forms um I
 
00:58:19.790 --> 00:58:19.800 align:start position:0%
guess maybe we deal with this in a
 
00:58:21.890 --> 00:58:21.900 align:start position:0%
different way but I these are people who
 
00:58:24.349 --> 00:58:24.359 align:start position:0%
are undergoing a pretty severe change in
 
00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
their life when their license is
 
00:58:27.890 --> 00:58:27.900 align:start position:0%
suspended I want to make sure that our
 
00:58:29.329 --> 00:58:29.339 align:start position:0%
roles and our forms aren't making their
 
00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
life more difficult than it already is
 
00:58:35.630 --> 00:58:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:38.089 --> 00:58:38.099 align:start position:0%
uh I'm concerned that the court ordered
 
00:58:40.490 --> 00:58:40.500 align:start position:0%
them to do something and then the DMV
 
00:58:42.049 --> 00:58:42.059 align:start position:0%
said oh don't bother
 
00:58:45.170 --> 00:58:45.180 align:start position:0%
that appears to be incorrect behavior on
 
00:58:47.870 --> 00:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
somebody's part something's wrong yes
 
00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:53.270 align:start position:0%
somebody's part something's wrong yes
really

00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:54.650 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:58:54.650 --> 00:58:54.660 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
well we can move to accept it we can
 
00:59:06.289 --> 00:59:06.299 align:start position:0%
come up with a correction and
 
00:59:09.589 --> 00:59:09.599 align:start position:0%
conditionally approve we can so make a
 
00:59:11.450 --> 00:59:11.460 align:start position:0%
permanent objection so you know I guess
 
00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:13.130 align:start position:0%
permanent objection so you know I guess
I

00:59:13.130 --> 00:59:13.140 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:59:16.010 --> 00:59:16.020 align:start position:0%
I appreciate what everybody has said but
 
00:59:19.069 --> 00:59:19.079 align:start position:0%
I'm I I'm guess I'm going to make a
 
00:59:21.410 --> 00:59:21.420 align:start position:0%
motion to approve
 
00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
um and if there's a second I'd I'd like
 
00:59:25.010 --> 00:59:25.020 align:start position:0%
to speak speak to the motion I'll second
 
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
that okay representative Lynn so I guess
 
00:59:31.010 --> 00:59:31.020 align:start position:0%
what um I'm sorry is that motion to
 
00:59:32.329 --> 00:59:32.339 align:start position:0%
conditionally approve with extra
 
00:59:34.730 --> 00:59:34.740 align:start position:0%
information with the with yes the same
 
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
conditions that that were previously
 
00:59:38.690 --> 00:59:38.700 align:start position:0%
stated by it by my colleague
 
00:59:41.150 --> 00:59:41.160 align:start position:0%
um and I guess what I was going to say
 
00:59:44.690 --> 00:59:44.700 align:start position:0%
is that if this um
 
00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:46.730 align:start position:0%
is that if this um
it

00:59:46.730 --> 00:59:46.740 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:59:49.609 --> 00:59:49.619 align:start position:0%
although it seems like this one section
 
00:59:52.609 --> 00:59:52.619 align:start position:0%
might generally be superfluous
 
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
I'm it strikes me that there could be
 
00:59:57.589 --> 00:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
circumstances in which the department
 
01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:00.900 align:start position:0%
would issue an order to somebody to
 
01:00:02.930 --> 01:00:02.940 align:start position:0%
surrender the license for again I'm just
 
01:00:05.450 --> 01:00:05.460 align:start position:0%
I'm sort of you know just trying to
 
01:00:07.490 --> 01:00:07.500 align:start position:0%
think of an example here but suppose the
 
01:00:09.730 --> 01:00:09.740 align:start position:0%
department had some information
 
01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
suggesting that the person that they're
 
01:00:16.130 --> 01:00:16.140 align:start position:0%
talking about was was misusing the
 
01:00:18.770 --> 01:00:18.780 align:start position:0%
physical license was somehow using it to
 
01:00:21.770 --> 01:00:21.780 align:start position:0%
you know to assist in making copies for
 
01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:23.880 align:start position:0%
for somebody else or something like I
 
01:00:25.490 --> 01:00:25.500 align:start position:0%
mean I could imagine a circumstance in
 
01:00:27.770 --> 01:00:27.780 align:start position:0%
which the department would say we do
 
01:00:30.530 --> 01:00:30.540 align:start position:0%
want you to return the license and if
 
01:00:32.089 --> 01:00:32.099 align:start position:0%
you hadn't done that that might be a
 
01:00:34.849 --> 01:00:34.859 align:start position:0%
that might be another reason to uh to
 
01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
impose some consequences again that I'm
 
01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
I you know that seems like it might be a
 
01:00:43.069 --> 01:00:43.079 align:start position:0%
uh not anyway a typical example but
 
01:00:45.410 --> 01:00:45.420 align:start position:0%
all I'm saying is I could see
 
01:00:47.329 --> 01:00:47.339 align:start position:0%
circumstances in which that provision
 
01:00:51.349 --> 01:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
would make sense and in most cases where
 
01:00:55.069 --> 01:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
it seems like it's just Superfluous so
 
01:00:57.170 --> 01:00:57.180 align:start position:0%
you know I don't
 
01:00:59.329 --> 01:00:59.339 align:start position:0%
to the extent that we have some that
 
01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:01.740 align:start position:0%
there's a need to approve these rules I
 
01:01:04.970 --> 01:01:04.980 align:start position:0%
I would not let this stop
 
01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:07.140 align:start position:0%
stop us from doing so
 
01:01:09.349 --> 01:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
representative but this but that's in
 
01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:11.160 align:start position:0%
that ambiguity
 
01:01:14.569 --> 01:01:14.579 align:start position:0%
is sort of identify the problems that we
 
01:01:16.490 --> 01:01:16.500 align:start position:0%
have right now with
 
01:01:18.770 --> 01:01:18.780 align:start position:0%
with forms and
 
01:01:21.109 --> 01:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
things not aligning
 
01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:23.940 align:start position:0%
so what we just causing
 
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:31.740 align:start position:0%
I guess I I would tend to say I would
 
01:01:33.289 --> 01:01:33.299 align:start position:0%
tend to say not because I'm not sure
 
01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
this is a this is simply a a provision
 
01:01:37.849 --> 01:01:37.859 align:start position:0%
that says
 
01:01:40.370 --> 01:01:40.380 align:start position:0%
if we order you to do something and you
 
01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
don't do it then certain things happen
 
01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:43.730 align:start position:0%
don't do it then certain things happen
and

01:01:43.730 --> 01:01:43.740 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:01:46.010 --> 01:01:46.020 align:start position:0%
I think that the answer in the
 
01:01:47.450 --> 01:01:47.460 align:start position:0%
run-of-the-mill case will be there
 
01:01:48.770 --> 01:01:48.780 align:start position:0%
simply not going to be ordering people
 
01:01:51.410 --> 01:01:51.420 align:start position:0%
to do something so if they don't
 
01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
but I I see your point I see your point
 
01:01:56.990 --> 01:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
I'm just you know I guess part of this
 
01:01:58.730 --> 01:01:58.740 align:start position:0%
is what
 
01:02:02.450 --> 01:02:02.460 align:start position:0%
how crucial is it that we act today
 
01:02:05.150 --> 01:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
well this has been postponed and our
 
01:02:08.569 --> 01:02:08.579 align:start position:0%
deadline is a week out I'm not Senator
 
01:02:10.069 --> 01:02:10.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:02:12.770 --> 01:02:12.780 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair I I would agree
 
01:02:16.609 --> 01:02:16.619 align:start position:0%
that if we this is here and it allows
 
01:02:19.010 --> 01:02:19.020 align:start position:0%
for certain actions to be taken if we
 
01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
were to remove it or suggest that they
 
01:02:24.349 --> 01:02:24.359 align:start position:0%
remove it and then it comes up that uh
 
01:02:27.530 --> 01:02:27.540 align:start position:0%
it is in fact necessary to have this in
 
01:02:30.289 --> 01:02:30.299 align:start position:0%
or circumstances arise where it's needed
 
01:02:33.109 --> 01:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
and it has been taken out we may find
 
01:02:34.910 --> 01:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
ourselves right back together with an
 
01:02:38.950 --> 01:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:42.530 --> 01:02:42.540 align:start position:0%
any further comments represent well I
 
01:02:44.450 --> 01:02:44.460 align:start position:0%
guess as long as we get the report which
 
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
helps okay right yes
 
01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
right so if we could have the motion
 
01:02:54.349 --> 01:02:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
it was a motion to could accept the
 
01:03:00.829 --> 01:03:00.839 align:start position:0%
conditional approval and to um come back
 
01:03:03.470 --> 01:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
to with a report on
 
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
um some extra information about forms
 
01:03:07.490 --> 01:03:07.500 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:03:10.789 --> 01:03:10.799 align:start position:0%
some case law I believe
 
01:03:12.890 --> 01:03:12.900 align:start position:0%
and the implementation of their policy I
 
01:03:13.849 --> 01:03:13.859 align:start position:0%
believe to
 
01:03:13.859 --> 01:03:15.589 align:start position:0%
believe to
okay

01:03:15.589 --> 01:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
oops attorney Hills thank you um I just
 
01:03:21.410 --> 01:03:21.420 align:start position:0%
want to clarify I but by you saying case
 
01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
law I'm thinking of the comments by
 
01:03:26.930 --> 01:03:26.940 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn that ref okay that
 
01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:28.260 align:start position:0%
referenced the issue with the pistol
 
01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
permit so correct okay thank you okay
 
01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
so that's the motion to conditionally
 
01:03:36.890 --> 01:03:36.900 align:start position:0%
approve any further comments
 
01:03:38.030 --> 01:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
those in favor
 
01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
I opposed
 
01:03:44.569 --> 01:03:44.579 align:start position:0%

okay Motor Carrier safety rules
 
01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:11.160 align:start position:0%
yes so uh 2022 186 on the motor carrier
 
01:04:13.789 --> 01:04:13.799 align:start position:0%
safety rules currently before the
 
01:04:15.530 --> 01:04:15.540 align:start position:0%
committee is a conditional approval
 
01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
request that was submitted prior to the
 
01:04:19.609 --> 01:04:19.619 align:start position:0%
May meeting
 
01:04:22.609 --> 01:04:22.619 align:start position:0%
um this item was postponed so that the
 
01:04:24.410 --> 01:04:24.420 align:start position:0%
department would have an opportunity to
 
01:04:25.970 --> 01:04:25.980 align:start position:0%
provide further information regarding
 
01:04:27.890 --> 01:04:27.900 align:start position:0%
the dates of the Federal Regulations
 
01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
being Incorporated by reference when
 
01:04:33.530 --> 01:04:33.540 align:start position:0%
um and when the particular document
 
01:04:35.089 --> 01:04:35.099 align:start position:0%
that's being Incorporated was last
 
01:04:35.099 --> 01:04:37.490 align:start position:0%
that's being Incorporated was last
updated

01:04:37.490 --> 01:04:37.500 align:start position:0%
updated
 
01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
good morning attorney Dave Hills from
 
01:04:41.270 --> 01:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
the Department of Safety
 
01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:42.170 align:start position:0%
the Department of Safety
um

01:04:42.170 --> 01:04:42.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:44.270 --> 01:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
what I discovered in answer to the
 
01:04:45.829 --> 01:04:45.839 align:start position:0%
committee's questions
 
01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
um is in looking at the federal
 
01:04:50.750 --> 01:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
government's website on the code of
 
01:04:52.849 --> 01:04:52.859 align:start position:0%
federal regulations
 
01:04:55.370 --> 01:04:55.380 align:start position:0%
um the current uh the most current
 
01:04:58.190 --> 01:04:58.200 align:start position:0%
version of the applicable cfrs would be
 
01:05:00.549 --> 01:05:00.559 align:start position:0%
the 2022 version
 
01:05:03.770 --> 01:05:03.780 align:start position:0%
and as I've been able to tell it they
 
01:05:06.650 --> 01:05:06.660 align:start position:0%
have a utility on their website that
 
01:05:10.190 --> 01:05:10.200 align:start position:0%
allows you to identify changes between
 
01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
two different versions and I've
 
01:05:14.450 --> 01:05:14.460 align:start position:0%
discovered that there were some changes
 
01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
to the applicable chapters of the CFR
 
01:05:20.690 --> 01:05:20.700 align:start position:0%
that were made in 2021
 
01:05:24.530 --> 01:05:24.540 align:start position:0%
um so I know that last meeting there was
 
01:05:27.049 --> 01:05:27.059 align:start position:0%
some anecdotal information provided to
 
01:05:29.809 --> 01:05:29.819 align:start position:0%
the committee where you know I asked one
 
01:05:31.730 --> 01:05:31.740 align:start position:0%
person sort of on the fly like how often
 
01:05:33.410 --> 01:05:33.420 align:start position:0%
do things change and I got you know
 
01:05:34.789 --> 01:05:34.799 align:start position:0%
about maybe every three to four years
 
01:05:38.089 --> 01:05:38.099 align:start position:0%
back but and doing research on the code
 
01:05:40.370 --> 01:05:40.380 align:start position:0%
of federal regulations website I learned
 
01:05:41.809 --> 01:05:41.819 align:start position:0%
that there were actually changes done
 
01:05:44.210 --> 01:05:44.220 align:start position:0%
last year so to speak
 
01:05:45.770 --> 01:05:45.780 align:start position:0%
um I hope that answers the committee's
 
01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:50.329 align:start position:0%
um I hope that answers the committee's
questions

01:05:50.329 --> 01:05:50.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:52.130 --> 01:05:52.140 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:05:53.809 --> 01:05:53.819 align:start position:0%
um I have a
 
01:05:56.750 --> 01:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
have a question if it changes annually
 
01:05:58.849 --> 01:05:58.859 align:start position:0%
is that any reason you shouldn't be able
 
01:06:01.609 --> 01:06:01.619 align:start position:0%
to put the current relevant version in
 
01:06:03.470 --> 01:06:03.480 align:start position:0%
your rules
 
01:06:05.030 --> 01:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
um I do on behalf of the department I do
 
01:06:09.410 --> 01:06:09.420 align:start position:0%
believe that it is an unnecessary
 
01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
hardship for the committee for the
 
01:06:14.289 --> 01:06:14.299 align:start position:0%
Department to need to come in every year
 
01:06:17.210 --> 01:06:17.220 align:start position:0%
to respond to changes in the in the
 
01:06:19.670 --> 01:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
federal code of regulations
 
01:06:22.490 --> 01:06:22.500 align:start position:0%
um as the chair pointed out there is a
 
01:06:25.309 --> 01:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
new addition to the applicable cfrs
 
01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
every year in the range where title 49
 
01:06:32.210 --> 01:06:32.220 align:start position:0%
is for these motor carriers it's updated
 
01:06:34.930 --> 01:06:34.940 align:start position:0%
annually every October
 
01:06:38.210 --> 01:06:38.220 align:start position:0%
and according to their website
 
01:06:40.010 --> 01:06:40.020 align:start position:0%
um you know even if there is no change
 
01:06:42.170 --> 01:06:42.180 align:start position:0%
from any particular year to year they
 
01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
will issue uh you know
 
01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:48.180 align:start position:0%
cover you know a jacket cover to
 
01:06:51.770 --> 01:06:51.780 align:start position:0%
basically say here's your new 2022 but
 
01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:53.640 align:start position:0%
um you I guess theoretically can put
 
01:06:57.650 --> 01:06:57.660 align:start position:0%
that on your old cfrs and that'll be the
 
01:06:59.089 --> 01:06:59.099 align:start position:0%
current one
 
01:07:00.890 --> 01:07:00.900 align:start position:0%
um you know it
 
01:07:03.410 --> 01:07:03.420 align:start position:0%
I I don't expect that it would be the
 
01:07:05.870 --> 01:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
case at all that if there were say a
 
01:07:09.170 --> 01:07:09.180 align:start position:0%
substantive change in 2019 and then no
 
01:07:11.870 --> 01:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
substantive change in 20 if the
 
01:07:13.490 --> 01:07:13.500 align:start position:0%
department were asked well what version
 
01:07:15.529 --> 01:07:15.539 align:start position:0%
are you implementing we're not going to
 
01:07:16.970 --> 01:07:16.980 align:start position:0%
say well we're going to pass on the 20
 
01:07:18.589 --> 01:07:18.599 align:start position:0%
because there was no change we're going
 
01:07:21.529 --> 01:07:21.539 align:start position:0%
to still do the 19 and again the next
 
01:07:23.569 --> 01:07:23.579 align:start position:0%
year if there's no change in 21 we're
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
not going to say well we're going to
 
01:07:27.410 --> 01:07:27.420 align:start position:0%
stick with the 19 because nothing's
 
01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
changed you know the answer is we
 
01:07:31.370 --> 01:07:31.380 align:start position:0%
implement the most current we enforce
 
01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:33.660 align:start position:0%
the most current regulation every year
 
01:07:35.809 --> 01:07:35.819 align:start position:0%
even if nothing changed from the year
 
01:07:37.370 --> 01:07:37.380 align:start position:0%
before I hope that answers the
 
01:07:40.010 --> 01:07:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions comments or
 
01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:46.809 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions comments or
concerns

01:07:46.809 --> 01:07:46.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:49.010 --> 01:07:49.020 align:start position:0%
there were no staff comments on this
 
01:07:51.230 --> 01:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
says I recall uh no the conditional
 
01:07:52.730 --> 01:07:52.740 align:start position:0%
approval request turned all the
 
01:07:54.109 --> 01:07:54.119 align:start position:0%
substantive comments into just
 
01:08:01.789 --> 01:08:01.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%
and it's someone of emotion move to
 
01:08:06.289 --> 01:08:06.299 align:start position:0%
approve second
 
01:08:08.569 --> 01:08:08.579 align:start position:0%
okay by representative Lynn seconded by
 
01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:17.269 --> 01:08:17.279 align:start position:0%

01:08:17.279 --> 01:08:19.370 align:start position:0%
all right those in favor
aye

01:08:19.370 --> 01:08:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:22.970 --> 01:08:22.980 align:start position:0%
opposed I arnay
 
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
and the motion rule is approved
 
01:08:30.590 --> 01:08:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
all right the next one is
 
01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:34.010 align:start position:0%
all right the next one is
um

01:08:34.010 --> 01:08:34.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh the office of a licensed Allied
 
01:08:39.789 --> 01:08:39.799 align:start position:0%
health professionals it's uh 2022 165
 
01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
and it's actually um it's now a consent
 
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
excuse me the department sent or the
 
01:08:48.229 --> 01:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
board sent um a conditional approval I
 
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
just and and everything is fine now I
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
just wanted to note to the agency and to
 
01:08:56.749 --> 01:08:56.759 align:start position:0%
jailcar that this proposal now cites to
 
01:09:00.709 --> 01:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
another proposal so this cannot be
 
01:09:03.650 --> 01:09:03.660 align:start position:0%
um adopted until the other one is
 
01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
adopted which is 20 23 52.
 
01:09:09.530 --> 01:09:09.540 align:start position:0%
um but it is all correct and it fixes
 
01:09:14.090 --> 01:09:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:18.349 --> 01:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
and is 52 is since 52 is on our calendar
 
01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
could we just move this down afterwards
 
01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.390 align:start position:0%
could we just move this down afterwards
please

01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:25.610 --> 01:09:25.620 align:start position:0%
um it's just a note to to gel car
 
01:09:27.289 --> 01:09:27.299 align:start position:0%
because they won't adopt they just won't
 
01:09:30.050 --> 01:09:30.060 align:start position:0%
adopt the this before the other proposal
 
01:09:32.990 --> 01:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
okay well in that case so the the rule
 
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
is fine
 
01:09:37.669 --> 01:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
yeah uh I happen to remember that in
 
01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 we repealed the Allied
 
01:09:43.789 --> 01:09:43.799 align:start position:0%
Health Board uh is that going to affect
 
01:09:46.789 --> 01:09:46.799 align:start position:0%
this rule very significantly
 
01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
so the board has not met Tina Kelly
 
01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
um program specialist office of
 
01:09:54.410 --> 01:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 2 has not been signed yet
 
01:09:58.970 --> 01:09:58.980 align:start position:0%
the board has not met in order to be
 
01:10:01.790 --> 01:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
able to withdraw this so my anticipation
 
01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:03.229 align:start position:0%
able to withdraw this so my anticipation
is

01:10:03.229 --> 01:10:03.239 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:10:05.090 --> 01:10:05.100 align:start position:0%
this is probably going to be the last
 
01:10:06.709 --> 01:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
time you see this we'll have to put
 
01:10:08.330 --> 01:10:08.340 align:start position:0%
something forward that says because
 
01:10:10.610 --> 01:10:10.620 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 was signed we're
 
01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
withdrawing anything associated with
 
01:10:19.310 --> 01:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh would it save us trouble if we just
 
01:10:24.169 --> 01:10:24.179 align:start position:0%
postponed it until after Hospital you
 
01:10:27.410 --> 01:10:27.420 align:start position:0%
could do that yes fine I moved to do so
 
01:10:28.910 --> 01:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
second oh
 
01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
those in favor
 
01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:31.189 align:start position:0%
those in favor
aye

01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
aye
 
01:10:33.649 --> 01:10:33.659 align:start position:0%
okay thank you well we don't want to to
 
01:10:35.930 --> 01:10:35.940 align:start position:0%
exercise you unnecessarily there's
 
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
enough necessary exercise going on at
 
01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
the moment
 
01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
all right so we will put we'll postpone
 
01:10:44.930 --> 01:10:44.940 align:start position:0%
this until uh
 
01:10:47.209 --> 01:10:47.219 align:start position:0%
we need a waiver on that yes we will
 
01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
okay our next regular meeting and we
 
01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
will request a waiver if that's okay
 
01:10:55.130 --> 01:10:55.140 align:start position:0%
director moral okay press pause yes
 
01:10:57.890 --> 01:10:57.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:00.050 --> 01:11:00.060 align:start position:0%
thank you sense doing exercises all
 
01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:00.830 align:start position:0%
thank you sense doing exercises all
right

01:11:00.830 --> 01:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:11:06.290 --> 01:11:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:08.649 --> 01:11:08.659 align:start position:0%
so 2022
 
01:11:11.630 --> 01:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
197 is on the procedural rules for
 
01:11:14.450 --> 01:11:14.460 align:start position:0%
specific types of appeals there was a
 
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
conditional approval filed that
 
01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
addressed all the comments with regards
 
01:11:20.030 --> 01:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
to discrepancies between the rule text
 
01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
and the forms however there are a couple
 
01:11:25.610 --> 01:11:25.620 align:start position:0%
additional substantive comments that
 
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
remain a number of which were actually
 
01:11:29.810 --> 01:11:29.820 align:start position:0%
made the last time this rule came before
 
01:11:31.310 --> 01:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:11:34.910 --> 01:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
the first comment is on page rule page
 
01:11:37.850 --> 01:11:37.860 align:start position:0%
two of the rule text and is also
 
01:11:41.689 --> 01:11:41.699 align:start position:0%
reiterated on page three the rule
 
01:11:41.699 --> 01:11:42.290 align:start position:0%
reiterated on page three the rule
um

01:11:42.290 --> 01:11:42.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:45.050 --> 01:11:45.060 align:start position:0%
talks about default judgments and says
 
01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
that non-attendance by the taxpayer or
 
01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers representative
 
01:11:52.669 --> 01:11:52.679 align:start position:0%
at a noticed hearing will result in the
 
01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
dismissal of the appeal unless the
 
01:11:55.910 --> 01:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
failure is
 
01:11:58.729 --> 01:11:58.739 align:start position:0%
a failure to appear as excused the
 
01:12:00.169 --> 01:12:00.179 align:start position:0%
entering of a default judgment or
 
01:12:02.090 --> 01:12:02.100 align:start position:0%
limiting the opportunity to be present
 
01:12:04.490 --> 01:12:04.500 align:start position:0%
despite the circumstances May violate
 
01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
due process and as I stated this comment
 
01:12:11.229 --> 01:12:11.239 align:start position:0%
was made back in 2013 the last time this
 
01:12:14.149 --> 01:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
these rules were before the committee
 
01:12:16.430 --> 01:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
the next comment is on page three it's
 
01:12:18.310 --> 01:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
an unclear comment
 
01:12:21.169 --> 01:12:21.179 align:start position:0%
this rule talks about
 
01:12:24.169 --> 01:12:24.179 align:start position:0%
when the taxpayer will be excused they
 
01:12:26.450 --> 01:12:26.460 align:start position:0%
have to file notice within 14 days in
 
01:12:28.130 --> 01:12:28.140 align:start position:0%
order to be excused from a hearing but
 
01:12:30.229 --> 01:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
that time may be shortened if there is
 
01:12:32.750 --> 01:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
good cause however there's nothing in
 
01:12:34.610 --> 01:12:34.620 align:start position:0%
the rules that would
 
01:12:37.850 --> 01:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
explain what exactly good cause would be
 
01:12:41.450 --> 01:12:41.460 align:start position:0%
considered in order to get that
 
01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:43.010 align:start position:0%
considered in order to get that
um

01:12:43.010 --> 01:12:43.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:45.530 --> 01:12:45.540 align:start position:0%
essentially waiver of the 14 day
 
01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:47.209 align:start position:0%
essentially waiver of the 14 day
deadline

01:12:47.209 --> 01:12:47.219 align:start position:0%
deadline
 
01:12:49.370 --> 01:12:49.380 align:start position:0%
there's another unclear comment on page
 
01:12:52.669 --> 01:12:52.679 align:start position:0%
three that relates to the comment that
 
01:12:54.350 --> 01:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
was just talked about with regard to
 
01:12:55.630 --> 01:12:55.640 align:start position:0%
good cause
 
01:13:00.050 --> 01:13:00.060 align:start position:0%
the word may is used inappropriately it
 
01:13:01.270 --> 01:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
should be
 
01:13:04.130 --> 01:13:04.140 align:start position:0%
shall be shortened if there is good
 
01:13:06.229 --> 01:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
cause otherwise the board would have
 
01:13:08.810 --> 01:13:08.820 align:start position:0%
discretion to still deny even if there
 
01:13:11.689 --> 01:13:11.699 align:start position:0%
is good cause determined
 
01:13:14.209 --> 01:13:14.219 align:start position:0%
uh the next comment is also on page
 
01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
three is an unclear comment at the
 
01:13:17.330 --> 01:13:17.340 align:start position:0%
bottom of the page
 
01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
with regard to this rule it states that
 
01:13:22.370 --> 01:13:22.380 align:start position:0%
when a taxpayer does not appear within
 
01:13:24.550 --> 01:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
30 minutes of the hearing start time
 
01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
their case will be dismissed or
 
01:13:29.090 --> 01:13:29.100 align:start position:0%
defaulted however the rule goes on to
 
01:13:31.729 --> 01:13:31.739 align:start position:0%
say that if a municipality fails to
 
01:13:33.890 --> 01:13:33.900 align:start position:0%
appear then the board will decide the
 
01:13:35.709 --> 01:13:35.719 align:start position:0%
case on the hearing and the record
 
01:13:38.510 --> 01:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
additionally if the municipality
 
01:13:40.970 --> 01:13:40.980 align:start position:0%
appears before the conclusion of the
 
01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
hearing they still will be given the
 
01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be heard this discrepancy
 
01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
in treatment may be against the public
 
01:13:49.610 --> 01:13:49.620 align:start position:0%
interest if the committee determines
 
01:13:52.310 --> 01:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
that this rule treats like entities such
 
01:13:55.790 --> 01:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
as parties to a hearing differently once
 
01:13:58.130 --> 01:13:58.140 align:start position:0%
again this comment was made back in 2013
 
01:14:00.229 --> 01:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
the last time these rules came before
 
01:14:02.570 --> 01:14:02.580 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:14:05.450 --> 01:14:05.460 align:start position:0%
there's also an unclear comment on pages
 
01:14:08.450 --> 01:14:08.460 align:start position:0%
20 and 21 regarding
 
01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:09.110 align:start position:0%
20 and 21 regarding
um

01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:11.810 --> 01:14:11.820 align:start position:0%
the opening statement made by the board
 
01:14:14.030 --> 01:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
it does not say who gives the statement
 
01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the board if it's a board
 
01:14:18.530 --> 01:14:18.540 align:start position:0%
member if it's a representative and once
 
01:14:20.330 --> 01:14:20.340 align:start position:0%
again that comment was made back in
 
01:14:20.340 --> 01:14:22.189 align:start position:0%
again that comment was made back in
2013.

01:14:22.189 --> 01:14:22.199 align:start position:0%
2013.
 
01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:23.760 align:start position:0%

continuance from the May meeting which
 
01:14:36.530 --> 01:14:36.540 align:start position:0%
we appreciated because it gave us the
 
01:14:38.270 --> 01:14:38.280 align:start position:0%
ability to work with the committee
 
01:14:41.090 --> 01:14:41.100 align:start position:0%
attorney and try to narrow down and make
 
01:14:43.010 --> 01:14:43.020 align:start position:0%
most of the suggested changes however
 
01:14:45.410 --> 01:14:45.420 align:start position:0%
attorney Ricard is right these are the
 
01:14:46.970 --> 01:14:46.980 align:start position:0%
remaining ones so I'll just go through
 
01:14:50.030 --> 01:14:50.040 align:start position:0%

the board
 
01:15:00.729 --> 01:15:00.739 align:start position:0%
I apologize
 
01:15:03.169 --> 01:15:03.179 align:start position:0%
so yeah some of these have have come up
 
01:15:04.729 --> 01:15:04.739 align:start position:0%
before in the past
 
01:15:08.030 --> 01:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
um but I will start with talking about
 
01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:09.070 align:start position:0%
um but I will start with talking about
um

01:15:09.070 --> 01:15:09.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:14.570 --> 01:15:14.580 align:start position:0%
20205 non-attendance by the taxpayer
 
01:15:16.130 --> 01:15:16.140 align:start position:0%
uh the board
 
01:15:19.310 --> 01:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
strives to give anywheres up to six
 
01:15:21.410 --> 01:15:21.420 align:start position:0%
months notice of hearings
 
01:15:25.610 --> 01:15:25.620 align:start position:0%
um the board has jurisdiction over at
 
01:15:28.010 --> 01:15:28.020 align:start position:0%
least 70 taxes some are original
 
01:15:29.990 --> 01:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and some are shared with
 
01:15:31.610 --> 01:15:31.620 align:start position:0%
the Superior Court we have concurrent
 
01:15:34.010 --> 01:15:34.020 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction oftentimes these cases are
 
01:15:36.890 --> 01:15:36.900 align:start position:0%
large they take months if not years to
 
01:15:39.770 --> 01:15:39.780 align:start position:0%
prepare for so we do our best to go over
 
01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
and above 541 and giving extra notice
 
01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:44.750 align:start position:0%
and above 541 and giving extra notice
um

01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:47.990 --> 01:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
keeping in mind that this process a lot
 
01:15:49.790 --> 01:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
of the taxes especially property tax
 
01:15:52.550 --> 01:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
starts at the local level by the time
 
01:15:55.209 --> 01:15:55.219 align:start position:0%
they do have a choice where to appeal
 
01:15:57.530 --> 01:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
they're essentially bringing an action
 
01:15:59.510 --> 01:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
against the municipality contesting
 
01:16:02.630 --> 01:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
their assessment what happens is by the
 
01:16:04.250 --> 01:16:04.260 align:start position:0%
time they get to the board one to two
 
01:16:06.189 --> 01:16:06.199 align:start position:0%
years later they get their hearing date
 
01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
we have given them significant notice of
 
01:16:10.550 --> 01:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
a hearing
 
01:16:13.310 --> 01:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
but oftentimes and I can count them in
 
01:16:15.770 --> 01:16:15.780 align:start position:0%
my 22 years a handful of times people
 
01:16:18.410 --> 01:16:18.420 align:start position:0%
some people have gotten tired of waiting
 
01:16:19.970 --> 01:16:19.980 align:start position:0%
that long and they just don't show up
 
01:16:22.310 --> 01:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
after the municipality has gone to Great
 
01:16:24.950 --> 01:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
expense to prepare and pay for
 
01:16:26.930 --> 01:16:26.940 align:start position:0%
Consultants appraisals those are very
 
01:16:29.450 --> 01:16:29.460 align:start position:0%
pricey and a taxpayer just doesn't feel
 
01:16:30.970 --> 01:16:30.980 align:start position:0%
like coming
 
01:16:33.950 --> 01:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
I believe that this is where
 
01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:35.510 align:start position:0%
I believe that this is where
um

01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:38.689 --> 01:16:38.699 align:start position:0%
we will give 30 minutes A lot of people
 
01:16:41.630 --> 01:16:41.640 align:start position:0%
you know they're coming down from the
 
01:16:42.950 --> 01:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
North country or out of state or
 
01:16:45.050 --> 01:16:45.060 align:start position:0%
whatever so we do allow for for someone
 
01:16:48.229 --> 01:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
being late but in the end when a
 
01:16:50.030 --> 01:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
municipality is there with a witness and
 
01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
they've paid for that at the expense of
 
01:16:53.930 --> 01:16:53.940 align:start position:0%
other taxpayers and someone chooses not
 
01:16:55.490 --> 01:16:55.500 align:start position:0%
to show up
 
01:16:58.310 --> 01:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
um I think the due process argument the
 
01:17:00.770 --> 01:17:00.780 align:start position:0%
the the end result is we will dismiss it
 
01:17:02.830 --> 01:17:02.840 align:start position:0%
by decision with a re-hearing paragraph
 
01:17:07.910 --> 01:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
and if a taxpayer just honestly we've
 
01:17:09.410 --> 01:17:09.420 align:start position:0%
had it happen a couple times where
 
01:17:11.030 --> 01:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayers made a mistake they put their
 
01:17:13.310 --> 01:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
date on the wrong calendar if they can
 
01:17:16.250 --> 01:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
specify in the order the decision States
 
01:17:19.189 --> 01:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
if you can give with specificity why you
 
01:17:20.930 --> 01:17:20.940 align:start position:0%
missed the hearing and didn't attend
 
01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
we'll reassign you a new hearing date so
 
01:17:26.930 --> 01:17:26.940 align:start position:0%
that is also you know there again an
 
01:17:28.610 --> 01:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
extra protection layer that if they've
 
01:17:29.870 --> 01:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
truly made a mistake and missed a
 
01:17:32.149 --> 01:17:32.159 align:start position:0%
hearing date you know and they can state
 
01:17:33.890 --> 01:17:33.900 align:start position:0%
with specificity the board has always
 
01:17:35.510 --> 01:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
granted that as long as you know there
 
01:17:37.390 --> 01:17:37.400 align:start position:0%
there's a good reason
 
01:17:41.050 --> 01:17:41.060 align:start position:0%
but most people that just don't show up
 
01:17:43.370 --> 01:17:43.380 align:start position:0%
municipalities can come back and ask for
 
01:17:45.649 --> 01:17:45.659 align:start position:0%
costs to recover some of those costs for
 
01:17:48.110 --> 01:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
for a taxpayer just not wanting to be
 
01:17:50.390 --> 01:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
there I've had people call up from
 
01:17:51.709 --> 01:17:51.719 align:start position:0%
hospital beds
 
01:17:54.110 --> 01:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
um people get sick we're fine with
 
01:17:56.270 --> 01:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
continuances on an emergency basis just
 
01:17:58.189 --> 01:17:58.199 align:start position:0%
like any Court would be but when
 
01:18:00.709 --> 01:18:00.719 align:start position:0%
somebody just doesn't
 
01:18:02.990 --> 01:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
think to call and say you know what I'm
 
01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
just going to withdraw this case I'm
 
01:18:06.169 --> 01:18:06.179 align:start position:0%
tired I've waited too long I'm over it
 
01:18:08.630 --> 01:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
now or whatever and they don't notify
 
01:18:10.970 --> 01:18:10.980 align:start position:0%
anyone and we're all ready to go and
 
01:18:13.010 --> 01:18:13.020 align:start position:0%
then just someone doesn't show up
 
01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
um that rehearing paragraph is their
 
01:18:19.250 --> 01:18:19.260 align:start position:0%
chance to you know sort of justify why
 
01:18:22.310 --> 01:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
they didn't come and it works well I can
 
01:18:24.110 --> 01:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
like I said in my 22 years I can count
 
01:18:25.729 --> 01:18:25.739 align:start position:0%
them on two hands it doesn't happen
 
01:18:29.630 --> 01:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
often but that is their remedy so that
 
01:18:34.010 --> 01:18:34.020 align:start position:0%
would be our response to 20205c
 
01:18:34.020 --> 01:18:36.590 align:start position:0%
would be our response to 20205c
questions

01:18:36.590 --> 01:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned that you don't
 
01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:40.370 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned that you don't
um

01:18:40.370 --> 01:18:40.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:42.830 --> 01:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
when you if the
 
01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:45.709 align:start position:0%
when you if the
uh

01:18:45.709 --> 01:18:45.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
if it's the municipality that doesn't
 
01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.850 align:start position:0%
if it's the municipality that doesn't
show

01:18:49.850 --> 01:18:49.860 align:start position:0%
show
 
01:18:52.790 --> 01:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
and the taxpayer does show you still go
 
01:18:54.890 --> 01:18:54.900 align:start position:0%
ahead and hold the hearing
 
01:18:57.350 --> 01:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that is it is the
 
01:19:00.290 --> 01:19:00.300 align:start position:0%
taxpayers burden by law it is their case
 
01:19:02.649 --> 01:19:02.659 align:start position:0%
they're bringing the action
 
01:19:04.910 --> 01:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
initially when an appeal is filed with
 
01:19:07.010 --> 01:19:07.020 align:start position:0%
the board the we request the
 
01:19:10.610 --> 01:19:10.620 align:start position:0%
municipality provide all the documents
 
01:19:13.490 --> 01:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
as the basis for the assessment their
 
01:19:15.530 --> 01:19:15.540 align:start position:0%
number is presumed correct unless a
 
01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayer can prove that they were
 
01:19:20.209 --> 01:19:20.219 align:start position:0%
disproportionately assessed or somehow
 
01:19:21.950 --> 01:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
there's errors
 
01:19:25.790 --> 01:19:25.800 align:start position:0%
um again in my and I can't say this this
 
01:19:26.930 --> 01:19:26.940 align:start position:0%
will always be the case but
 
01:19:26.940 --> 01:19:28.550 align:start position:0%
will always be the case but
municipalities

01:19:28.550 --> 01:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:19:30.530 --> 01:19:30.540 align:start position:0%
um they have a much better track record
 
01:19:32.090 --> 01:19:32.100 align:start position:0%
of showing up they want to defend their
 
01:19:34.010 --> 01:19:34.020 align:start position:0%
number but but it's presumed correct and
 
01:19:36.110 --> 01:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
it is the taxpayer's burden
 
01:19:38.510 --> 01:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
um so as long as uh that's not to say if
 
01:19:40.310 --> 01:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
if the board looks at the municipal
 
01:19:42.110 --> 01:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
records They always review the file
 
01:19:44.030 --> 01:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
ahead of time and if they have if
 
01:19:45.709 --> 01:19:45.719 align:start position:0%
there's more questions than what's in
 
01:19:47.330 --> 01:19:47.340 align:start position:0%
the file
 
01:19:50.810 --> 01:19:50.820 align:start position:0%
um they will they you know if if they
 
01:19:53.149 --> 01:19:53.159 align:start position:0%
don't show up they may opt to reschedule
 
01:19:54.890 --> 01:19:54.900 align:start position:0%
it if there's more questions for a
 
01:19:57.290 --> 01:19:57.300 align:start position:0%
municipality but in
 
01:20:00.470 --> 01:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
um in Practical terms municipalities do
 
01:20:04.250 --> 01:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
have a great track record of coming
 
01:20:07.910 --> 01:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
um and again a lot of them will maybe
 
01:20:09.709 --> 01:20:09.719 align:start position:0%
send contractors
 
01:20:13.550 --> 01:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
um but the board is well versed in those
 
01:20:15.470 --> 01:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
same documents coming in in about every
 
01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:17.090 align:start position:0%
same documents coming in in about every
file

01:20:17.090 --> 01:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
file
 
01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:17.870 align:start position:0%
file
um

01:20:17.870 --> 01:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:20.390 --> 01:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
so that's That's the basis
 
01:20:23.209 --> 01:20:23.219 align:start position:0%
other questions representative layout um
 
01:20:24.530 --> 01:20:24.540 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
being here my question is I'm having
 
01:20:28.729 --> 01:20:28.739 align:start position:0%
trouble finding that rehearing paragraph
 
01:20:30.470 --> 01:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
and as I'm reading this it looks to me
 
01:20:31.970 --> 01:20:31.980 align:start position:0%
like somebody getting into a car
 
01:20:34.130 --> 01:20:34.140 align:start position:0%
accident on their way wouldn't have an
 
01:20:35.570 --> 01:20:35.580 align:start position:0%
opportunity if you can point me to that
 
01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
rehearing paragraph I'd appreciate it
 
01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
um well the rehearings at 541 we put it
 
01:20:44.209 --> 01:20:44.219 align:start position:0%
in a in a decision it goes out in every
 
01:20:46.490 --> 01:20:46.500 align:start position:0%
decision regardless if they're dismissed
 
01:20:48.590 --> 01:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
or not even on a typical case that the
 
01:20:50.270 --> 01:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
board here is that every
 
01:20:52.370 --> 01:20:52.380 align:start position:0%
because of 541 it's in every decision
 
01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
that we issue
 
01:20:56.870 --> 01:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
um I I it's not specifically carved out
 
01:20:59.030 --> 01:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
and ruled because it's in statute
 
01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
um but I'm new to Del Carr so thank you
 
01:21:03.890 --> 01:21:03.900 align:start position:0%
I figured I'd rather ask than yeah thank
 
01:21:07.430 --> 01:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
you okay rep director Morrow
 
01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:08.450 align:start position:0%
you okay rep director Morrow
um

01:21:08.450 --> 01:21:08.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:10.490 --> 01:21:10.500 align:start position:0%
following up on representative Leon's
 
01:21:13.209 --> 01:21:13.219 align:start position:0%
question that 541a does talk about
 
01:21:16.090 --> 01:21:16.100 align:start position:0%
re-hearings but that is something that
 
01:21:19.450 --> 01:21:19.460 align:start position:0%
occurs after a decision is made
 
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
if the board makes the decision then you
 
01:21:24.830 --> 01:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
can apply for a re-hearing but usually
 
01:21:26.750 --> 01:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
the grounds for a re-hearing are very
 
01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:27.910 align:start position:0%
the grounds for a re-hearing are very
narrow

01:21:27.910 --> 01:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
narrow
 
01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:29.450 align:start position:0%
narrow
I

01:21:29.450 --> 01:21:29.460 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:21:31.729 --> 01:21:31.739 align:start position:0%
I didn't look at this rule extensively
 
01:21:33.649 --> 01:21:33.659 align:start position:0%
so I stand to be corrected by Miss
 
01:21:36.709 --> 01:21:36.719 align:start position:0%
delmac or Rebecca
 
01:21:39.530 --> 01:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
but the rule itself seems to talk about
 
01:21:42.830 --> 01:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
applying 14 days in advance if you
 
01:21:45.050 --> 01:21:45.060 align:start position:0%
cannot make a hearing that wouldn't
 
01:21:46.610 --> 01:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
cover somebody that's in an automobile
 
01:21:48.350 --> 01:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
accident on the way
 
01:21:52.010 --> 01:21:52.020 align:start position:0%
now I understand what the policy is from
 
01:21:55.910 --> 01:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
Miss delmach's uh testimony and this is
 
01:21:58.550 --> 01:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
very rare occurrence that this would
 
01:22:01.610 --> 01:22:01.620 align:start position:0%
happen but uh technically that procedure
 
01:22:04.070 --> 01:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
is a rule
 
01:22:09.110 --> 01:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:12.290 --> 01:22:12.300 align:start position:0%
on thank you um so with that information
 
01:22:14.149 --> 01:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
would it make sense to put that General
 
01:22:15.950 --> 01:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
policy that if somebody has a good
 
01:22:17.570 --> 01:22:17.580 align:start position:0%
reason calling from the hospital better
 
01:22:20.330 --> 01:22:20.340 align:start position:0%
having a car accident that they have an
 
01:22:22.430 --> 01:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
authorization for a re-hearing or how
 
01:22:24.649 --> 01:22:24.659 align:start position:0%
would be the best way to put that good
 
01:22:32.209 --> 01:22:32.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:34.490 --> 01:22:34.500 align:start position:0%
um so with regard to that it's certainly
 
01:22:36.290 --> 01:22:36.300 align:start position:0%
something that could be added to this
 
01:22:38.689 --> 01:22:38.699 align:start position:0%
particular section that you know should
 
01:22:42.050 --> 01:22:42.060 align:start position:0%
a taxpayer not attend and is issued a
 
01:22:43.669 --> 01:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
denial that they will receive a notice
 
01:22:46.790 --> 01:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
with an opportunity to
 
01:22:49.250 --> 01:22:49.260 align:start position:0%
present evidence that they were unable
 
01:22:51.229 --> 01:22:51.239 align:start position:0%
to make it and be issued a re-hearing
 
01:22:53.030 --> 01:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
that is something that could be created
 
01:22:55.430 --> 01:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
as a rule to make it explicitly clear
 
01:22:57.890 --> 01:22:57.900 align:start position:0%
because I agree I think it should be in
 
01:22:59.810 --> 01:22:59.820 align:start position:0%
the rules okay
 
01:23:02.750 --> 01:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
however I think um you may need a
 
01:23:05.570 --> 01:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
preliminary objection if you want some
 
01:23:07.550 --> 01:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
of these things changed there are a lot
 
01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
of clarity
 
01:23:12.110 --> 01:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
um comments on here some of which are
 
01:23:13.850 --> 01:23:13.860 align:start position:0%
um you know like they use the term good
 
01:23:16.130 --> 01:23:16.140 align:start position:0%
cause but they don't Define what good
 
01:23:18.890 --> 01:23:18.900 align:start position:0%
cause is and things like that
 
01:23:22.490 --> 01:23:22.500 align:start position:0%
um so it may be better to give them that
 
01:23:25.189 --> 01:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
time to to Really
 
01:23:28.130 --> 01:23:28.140 align:start position:0%
um fix the issues give them time and
 
01:23:29.930 --> 01:23:29.940 align:start position:0%
also in the objection specifying the
 
01:23:31.610 --> 01:23:31.620 align:start position:0%
things that you want change so they know
 
01:23:33.709 --> 01:23:33.719 align:start position:0%
what exactly they have to address
 
01:23:33.719 --> 01:23:36.830 align:start position:0%
what exactly they have to address
okay

01:23:36.830 --> 01:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:39.050 --> 01:23:39.060 align:start position:0%
okay representative Schmidt moves we
 
01:23:41.390 --> 01:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
preliminary object is there a second
 
01:23:43.370 --> 01:23:43.380 align:start position:0%
representatively on seconds
 
01:23:45.830 --> 01:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
okay and
 
01:23:48.169 --> 01:23:48.179 align:start position:0%
I would say that the clarity comments
 
01:23:51.229 --> 01:23:51.239 align:start position:0%
from staff and
 
01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
um expansion of what
 
01:23:56.630 --> 01:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
it shall be shortened for good cause for
 
01:23:56.640 --> 01:23:57.649 align:start position:0%
it shall be shortened for good cause for
example

01:23:57.649 --> 01:23:57.659 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:24:02.090 --> 01:24:02.100 align:start position:0%
would be a something and
 
01:24:04.490 --> 01:24:04.500 align:start position:0%
and including that procedure in the
 
01:24:08.270 --> 01:24:08.280 align:start position:0%
rules about the rehearing yes please
 
01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:14.510 align:start position:0%
rules about the rehearing yes please
definitely

01:24:14.510 --> 01:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:16.850 --> 01:24:16.860 align:start position:0%
are there any other points that people
 
01:24:20.270 --> 01:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
want to make sure are included in the
 
01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
are requested of the agency on their
 
01:24:29.209 --> 01:24:29.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:32.570 --> 01:24:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:39.649 --> 01:24:39.659 align:start position:0%
all right move to preliminary object to
 
01:24:44.209 --> 01:24:44.219 align:start position:0%
the rule with the requests we had
 
01:24:44.219 --> 01:24:45.770 align:start position:0%
the rule with the requests we had
um

01:24:45.770 --> 01:24:45.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:49.970 --> 01:24:49.980 align:start position:0%
those in favor I I opposed
 
01:24:52.970 --> 01:24:52.980 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much
 
01:24:59.870 --> 01:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:01.189 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:25:01.189 --> 01:25:01.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:25:01.199 --> 01:25:02.770 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:25:02.770 --> 01:25:02.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:06.350 --> 01:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
2022-237 reading and writing teacher and
 
01:25:08.149 --> 01:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
prep program
 
01:25:11.870 --> 01:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
so there's only one comment on this
 
01:25:13.850 --> 01:25:13.860 align:start position:0%
proposal and you'll see it at the top of
 
01:25:16.850 --> 01:25:16.860 align:start position:0%
the page of the rule which is uh page
 
01:25:19.149 --> 01:25:19.159 align:start position:0%
four of your PDF packet
 
01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
that legislative intent comment is there
 
01:25:25.870 --> 01:25:25.880 align:start position:0%
because paragraph B expired in 2018
 
01:25:28.850 --> 01:25:28.860 align:start position:0%
that paragraph makes up most of the
 
01:25:31.490 --> 01:25:31.500 align:start position:0%
proposals you can see and it contains
 
01:25:33.649 --> 01:25:33.659 align:start position:0%
the skills competency and knowledge
 
01:25:35.990 --> 01:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
requirements for reading and writing
 
01:25:37.970 --> 01:25:37.980 align:start position:0%
teachers and so the committee may have
 
01:25:41.209 --> 01:25:41.219 align:start position:0%
some questions for the agency about that
 
01:25:43.189 --> 01:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
expiration of the rule like I said since
 
01:25:43.199 --> 01:25:45.709 align:start position:0%
expiration of the rule like I said since
2018.

01:25:45.709 --> 01:25:45.719 align:start position:0%
2018.
 
01:25:49.370 --> 01:25:49.380 align:start position:0%
it's been a long five years yes
 
01:25:51.110 --> 01:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
good morning Steve Appleby division
 
01:25:53.149 --> 01:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
director Department of Education thank
 
01:25:55.250 --> 01:25:55.260 align:start position:0%
you for your time this morning we
 
01:25:57.410 --> 01:25:57.420 align:start position:0%
discovered that this section of the
 
01:26:00.169 --> 01:26:00.179 align:start position:0%
overall rule had expired late last fall
 
01:26:02.689 --> 01:26:02.699 align:start position:0%
and began the rulemaking process at that
 
01:26:02.699 --> 01:26:03.550 align:start position:0%
and began the rulemaking process at that
time

01:26:03.550 --> 01:26:03.560 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:26:06.649 --> 01:26:06.659 align:start position:0%
we have 73 individuals who currently
 
01:26:08.689 --> 01:26:08.699 align:start position:0%
hold this endorsement in our state that
 
01:26:10.970 --> 01:26:10.980 align:start position:0%
is Reading Writing teacher
 
01:26:13.490 --> 01:26:13.500 align:start position:0%
we have been started auditing looking to
 
01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
see if we denied anybody incorrectly
 
01:26:17.930 --> 01:26:17.940 align:start position:0%
while the rule is expired so far we have
 
01:26:19.189 --> 01:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
found none
 
01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
we are more than happy if you want a
 
01:26:24.709 --> 01:26:24.719 align:start position:0%
table for a month and we'll continue our
 
01:26:26.810 --> 01:26:26.820 align:start position:0%
research and I can
 
01:26:28.669 --> 01:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
give you a definite assurance that we
 
01:26:31.490 --> 01:26:31.500 align:start position:0%
haven't denied somebody but at this time
 
01:26:33.530 --> 01:26:33.540 align:start position:0%
we don't think we have we've only issued
 
01:26:35.689 --> 01:26:35.699 align:start position:0%
eight licenses under this endorsement
 
01:26:38.149 --> 01:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
during that five-year period
 
01:26:41.810 --> 01:26:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:45.410 --> 01:26:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:47.450 --> 01:26:47.460 align:start position:0%
and since I believe that fee is
 
01:26:49.430 --> 01:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
established by the rule and not by the
 
01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:50.530 align:start position:0%
established by the rule and not by the
statute

01:26:50.530 --> 01:26:50.540 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:26:54.290 --> 01:26:54.300 align:start position:0%
we would if we approve this rule I would
 
01:26:58.070 --> 01:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
request that you uh refund the fee
 
01:26:59.750 --> 01:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
since you didn't have the authority
 
01:27:01.790 --> 01:27:01.800 align:start position:0%
collect to collect it
 
01:27:03.229 --> 01:27:03.239 align:start position:0%
um Julie Shea administrative rules
 
01:27:03.239 --> 01:27:04.189 align:start position:0%
um Julie Shea administrative rules
coordinator

01:27:04.189 --> 01:27:04.199 align:start position:0%
coordinator
 
01:27:07.790 --> 01:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
um the fee for the certification is not
 
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
in this particular section of the rule
 
01:27:13.250 --> 01:27:13.260 align:start position:0%
um this is just the requirements for the
 
01:27:15.410 --> 01:27:15.420 align:start position:0%
certification we actually came to you a
 
01:27:18.590 --> 01:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
few months ago with all of our fees
 
01:27:21.350 --> 01:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
um and those were not they were expired
 
01:27:22.850 --> 01:27:22.860 align:start position:0%
for a few months
 
01:27:25.189 --> 01:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
um but not during the time that this was
 
01:27:28.010 --> 01:27:28.020 align:start position:0%
so the fee table is not in this
 
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
particular rule for this certification
 
01:27:31.490 --> 01:27:31.500 align:start position:0%
if that makes sense
 
01:27:34.430 --> 01:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I'm glad to hear it
 
01:27:36.530 --> 01:27:36.540 align:start position:0%
if I could add one more Point
 
01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
um unlike most of our rule sets which
 
01:27:41.870 --> 01:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
the entire section expires in this
 
01:27:44.090 --> 01:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
instance it was one paragraph within an
 
01:27:46.850 --> 01:27:46.860 align:start position:0%
overall rule that expired so the rest of
 
01:27:50.090 --> 01:27:50.100 align:start position:0%
the rule was still in effect it was just
 
01:27:52.010 --> 01:27:52.020 align:start position:0%
that one paragraph
 
01:27:54.950 --> 01:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
so because
 
01:27:58.629 --> 01:27:58.639 align:start position:0%
so the first paragraph is the education
 
01:28:01.070 --> 01:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
requirements in all of the things that
 
01:28:02.990 --> 01:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
would be needed and then B is the
 
01:28:04.970 --> 01:28:04.980 align:start position:0%
content that would be needed so
 
01:28:08.209 --> 01:28:08.219 align:start position:0%
what we want to do is ensure that nobody
 
01:28:10.610 --> 01:28:10.620 align:start position:0%
was denied based on not having that
 
01:28:12.410 --> 01:28:12.420 align:start position:0%
content standard when the paragraph Was
 
01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:16.850 align:start position:0%
content standard when the paragraph Was
expired

01:28:16.850 --> 01:28:16.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:22.189 --> 01:28:22.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:22.199 --> 01:28:24.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:28:24.950 --> 01:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:27.050 --> 01:28:27.060 align:start position:0%
okay move by representative Schmidt
 
01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
second by representative Lynn any other
 
01:28:32.750 --> 01:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
comments questions concerns
 
01:28:35.149 --> 01:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
seeing none those in favor
 
01:28:35.159 --> 01:28:36.229 align:start position:0%
seeing none those in favor
aye

01:28:36.229 --> 01:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
aye
 
01:28:38.750 --> 01:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
those opposed all right thank you very
 
01:28:47.470 --> 01:28:47.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:49.930 --> 01:28:49.940 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine
 
01:28:49.940 --> 01:28:51.550 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine
so

01:28:51.550 --> 01:28:51.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:28:54.470 --> 01:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
2023-18 the definition of medical review
 
01:28:56.689 --> 01:28:56.699 align:start position:0%
subcommittee access to public records
 
01:28:59.270 --> 01:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
and draft decisions this is on the
 
01:29:02.330 --> 01:29:02.340 align:start position:0%
regular agenda because these rules had
 
01:29:06.950 --> 01:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
expired back on April 12th of 2019 even
 
01:29:10.669 --> 01:29:10.679 align:start position:0%
though they are 100 rules the reason for
 
01:29:13.370 --> 01:29:13.380 align:start position:0%
that is because when these rules were
 
01:29:15.910 --> 01:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
adopted back in
 
01:29:18.290 --> 01:29:18.300 align:start position:0%
2000 and
 
01:29:18.300 --> 01:29:19.010 align:start position:0%
2000 and
um

01:29:19.010 --> 01:29:19.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
nine nine thank you I couldn't find that
 
01:29:24.830 --> 01:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
there uh 2009
 
01:29:27.050 --> 01:29:27.060 align:start position:0%
um they were approved by the committee
 
01:29:30.709 --> 01:29:30.719 align:start position:0%
but not pursuant to 541 a13 which meant
 
01:29:32.810 --> 01:29:32.820 align:start position:0%
that they were eight year rules as
 
01:29:34.610 --> 01:29:34.620 align:start position:0%
opposed to the non-expiring rules that
 
01:29:37.669 --> 01:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
100 organizational rules normally are so
 
01:29:39.950 --> 01:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
that is why these had an expiration date
 
01:29:43.490 --> 01:29:43.500 align:start position:0%
but the rest of them do not and the only
 
01:29:47.930 --> 01:29:47.940 align:start position:0%
substantive comment on this rule that I
 
01:29:50.930 --> 01:29:50.940 align:start position:0%
had is an unclear edit comment and it's
 
01:29:53.270 --> 01:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
an unclear edit because it could be
 
01:29:55.430 --> 01:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
changed editorially but if the edit
 
01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
isn't made it would make it unclear what
 
01:30:00.169 --> 01:30:00.179 align:start position:0%
exactly the section is referring to
 
01:30:02.870 --> 01:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
because the title is draft decisions
 
01:30:06.290 --> 01:30:06.300 align:start position:0%
however uh paragraphs B and C seem to
 
01:30:09.050 --> 01:30:09.060 align:start position:0%
apply to emergency decisions and final
 
01:30:11.209 --> 01:30:11.219 align:start position:0%
decisions so it's unclear that those
 
01:30:16.129 --> 01:30:16.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:18.110 --> 01:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
good morning Tina Kelly from the office
 
01:30:19.189 --> 01:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
of professional ice Insurance
 
01:30:19.199 --> 01:30:21.229 align:start position:0%
of professional ice Insurance
certification

01:30:21.229 --> 01:30:21.239 align:start position:0%
certification
 
01:30:22.970 --> 01:30:22.980 align:start position:0%
um we are playing playing cleanup with
 
01:30:24.950 --> 01:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
some of these rules
 
01:30:26.750 --> 01:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
um expecting that they hadn't expired
 
01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
but they did they would have been
 
01:30:31.189 --> 01:30:31.199 align:start position:0%
covered under 91a
 
01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
um the description of medical review
 
01:30:37.430 --> 01:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is in RSA 329 colon 2 Roman
 
01:30:41.090 --> 01:30:41.100 align:start position:0%
numeral two B and we will change under
 
01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:42.250 align:start position:0%
numeral two B and we will change under
Med

01:30:42.250 --> 01:30:42.260 align:start position:0%
Med
 
01:30:44.930 --> 01:30:44.940 align:start position:0%
105.03 to board decisions rather than
 
01:30:47.090 --> 01:30:47.100 align:start position:0%
draft decisions
 
01:30:49.970 --> 01:30:49.980 align:start position:0%
okay is this affected by any current
 
01:30:52.189 --> 01:30:52.199 align:start position:0%
legislation I remember something coming
 
01:30:54.229 --> 01:30:54.239 align:start position:0%
through on the medical review
 
01:30:54.239 --> 01:30:57.050 align:start position:0%
through on the medical review
subcommittee

01:30:57.050 --> 01:30:57.060 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
01:31:08.390 --> 01:31:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
good morning Douglas elster how general
 
01:31:11.330 --> 01:31:11.340 align:start position:0%
counsel for the office of professional
 
01:31:13.250 --> 01:31:13.260 align:start position:0%
licensure and certification as of right
 
01:31:15.290 --> 01:31:15.300 align:start position:0%
now there is no repeal of that statutory
 
01:31:15.300 --> 01:31:16.430 align:start position:0%
now there is no repeal of that statutory
section

01:31:16.430 --> 01:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:31:19.729 --> 01:31:19.739 align:start position:0%
in coming through the pipes but it is an
 
01:31:22.370 --> 01:31:22.380 align:start position:0%
interesting question
 
01:31:26.209 --> 01:31:26.219 align:start position:0%
because of the changes to mrsc
 
01:31:29.390 --> 01:31:29.400 align:start position:0%
okay well we'll uh look so as of now you
 
01:31:33.290 --> 01:31:33.300 align:start position:0%
don't have it we'll see what happens but
 
01:31:37.250 --> 01:31:37.260 align:start position:0%
but these rules are in accord are being
 
01:31:39.050 --> 01:31:39.060 align:start position:0%
cleaned up and adopted and you will fix
 
01:31:41.810 --> 01:31:41.820 align:start position:0%
that draft decision headers okay thank
 
01:31:43.669 --> 01:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
you any other questions of
 
01:31:43.679 --> 01:31:45.290 align:start position:0%
you any other questions of
Representative

01:31:45.290 --> 01:31:45.300 align:start position:0%
Representative
 
01:31:47.930 --> 01:31:47.940 align:start position:0%
you would follow up on that because in
 
01:31:52.490 --> 01:31:52.500 align:start position:0%
the in the um bills
 
01:31:56.149 --> 01:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
I I think the record should reflect that
 
01:31:59.930 --> 01:31:59.940 align:start position:0%
uh attorney osterhout uh responded in
 
01:32:02.570 --> 01:32:02.580 align:start position:0%
the affirmative but by nodding his head
 
01:32:04.610 --> 01:32:04.620 align:start position:0%
rather than saying yes so the record
 
01:32:07.610 --> 01:32:07.620 align:start position:0%
should reflect his answer
 
01:32:09.530 --> 01:32:09.540 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Schmidt
 
01:32:11.629 --> 01:32:11.639 align:start position:0%
represent grota I just want to make sure
 
01:32:13.310 --> 01:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
that indeed the medical review
 
01:32:16.129 --> 01:32:16.139 align:start position:0%
subcommittee will now become a peer
 
01:32:19.850 --> 01:32:19.860 align:start position:0%
review type of board so if there's
 
01:32:22.070 --> 01:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
legislation coming forward I presume
 
01:32:23.990 --> 01:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
they will be changing this rule to agree
 
01:32:25.970 --> 01:32:25.980 align:start position:0%
with it
 
01:32:28.250 --> 01:32:28.260 align:start position:0%
correct okay
 
01:32:30.350 --> 01:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
we haven't yet approved it as I recall
 
01:32:33.350 --> 01:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions comments or
 
01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:37.370 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions comments or
concerns

01:32:37.370 --> 01:32:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:39.470 --> 01:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
all right I presume there's no fees
 
01:32:43.070 --> 01:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
involved in this section no okay good
 
01:32:46.729 --> 01:32:46.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:50.750 --> 01:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
a second by Senator Ward and further
 
01:32:50.760 --> 01:32:51.950 align:start position:0%
a second by Senator Ward and further
discussion

01:32:51.950 --> 01:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:32:53.629 --> 01:32:53.639 align:start position:0%
those in favor
 
01:32:55.490 --> 01:32:55.500 align:start position:0%
aye aye opposed
 
01:33:04.490 --> 01:33:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:06.250 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:33:06.250 --> 01:33:06.260 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:33:10.070 --> 01:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
2023-21 certification of assessors
 
01:33:12.470 --> 01:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
this proposal makes changes to the rules
 
01:33:14.090 --> 01:33:14.100 align:start position:0%
that govern the certification of
 
01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
assessors and assessor assistance
 
01:33:19.729 --> 01:33:19.739 align:start position:0%
uh the agency has filed a conditional
 
01:33:21.169 --> 01:33:21.179 align:start position:0%
approval request that pretty much
 
01:33:23.149 --> 01:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
resolves all the issues except for one
 
01:33:26.330 --> 01:33:26.340 align:start position:0%
and you'll see that on page five of the
 
01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request
 
01:33:31.189 --> 01:33:31.199 align:start position:0%
and so here
 
01:33:33.070 --> 01:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
um that's ASB
 
01:33:36.590 --> 01:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
305.01 B you'll see that this is a brand
 
01:33:40.129 --> 01:33:40.139 align:start position:0%
new section in the role that impacts dra
 
01:33:43.010 --> 01:33:43.020 align:start position:0%
certified property assessor assistance
 
01:33:46.750 --> 01:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
it looks like these folks are certified
 
01:33:49.250 --> 01:33:49.260 align:start position:0%
they have to meet certain requirements
 
01:33:51.350 --> 01:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
in order to be certified or to receive
 
01:33:54.350 --> 01:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
that certification by the dra and this
 
01:33:56.510 --> 01:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
new section establishing establishes
 
01:33:59.090 --> 01:33:59.100 align:start position:0%
continuing education and documentation
 
01:34:02.030 --> 01:34:02.040 align:start position:0%
requirements on on this on this class of
 
01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:03.370 align:start position:0%
requirements on on this on this class of
personnel

01:34:03.370 --> 01:34:03.380 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
01:34:06.169 --> 01:34:06.179 align:start position:0%
specifically it establishes a 10 hour
 
01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
requirement and then increases that
 
01:34:11.450 --> 01:34:11.460 align:start position:0%
yearly requirement until it reaches a
 
01:34:13.790 --> 01:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
total of 50 hours over a five-year
 
01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:14.870 align:start position:0%
total of 50 hours over a five-year
period

01:34:14.870 --> 01:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
period
 
01:34:17.390 --> 01:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
however the problem is is that the first
 
01:34:19.189 --> 01:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
year that this requirement becomes
 
01:34:22.610 --> 01:34:22.620 align:start position:0%
effective is in 2021
 
01:34:25.850 --> 01:34:25.860 align:start position:0%
so if you see there it says 10 hours are
 
01:34:27.950 --> 01:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
required for certifications expiring in
 
01:34:30.770 --> 01:34:30.780 align:start position:0%
2021 and then 20 hours for
 
01:34:34.310 --> 01:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
certifications expiring in 2022 and this
 
01:34:35.930 --> 01:34:35.940 align:start position:0%
looks like it's creating some
 
01:34:38.810 --> 01:34:38.820 align:start position:0%
retroactive requirements in violation of
 
01:34:40.610 --> 01:34:40.620 align:start position:0%
the Constitution
 
01:34:43.610 --> 01:34:43.620 align:start position:0%
the department says that and you should
 
01:34:47.689 --> 01:34:47.699 align:start position:0%
have a copy in the um the other the FP
 
01:34:49.570 --> 01:34:49.580 align:start position:0%
packet of
 
01:34:54.410 --> 01:34:54.420 align:start position:0%
hb1552 from 2022 of last year it does
 
01:34:56.930 --> 01:34:56.940 align:start position:0%
allow for the granting of an extension
 
01:34:59.649 --> 01:34:59.659 align:start position:0%
for the retroactive or for the
 
01:35:02.629 --> 01:35:02.639 align:start position:0%
continuing education requirements for
 
01:35:05.930 --> 01:35:05.940 align:start position:0%
them to be completed by August 31st of
 
01:35:07.070 --> 01:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
this year
 
01:35:09.470 --> 01:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
but the language in the bill doesn't set
 
01:35:11.810 --> 01:35:11.820 align:start position:0%
up an automatic extension so people have
 
01:35:14.330 --> 01:35:14.340 align:start position:0%
to ask for that extension in order to
 
01:35:15.830 --> 01:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
get it and they have to do that by
 
01:35:17.990 --> 01:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
August 31st of this year
 
01:35:19.729 --> 01:35:19.739 align:start position:0%
so the committee may have some questions
 
01:35:22.310 --> 01:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
about the number of individuals impacted
 
01:35:24.890 --> 01:35:24.900 align:start position:0%
what notification has been done whether
 
01:35:26.750 --> 01:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
or not anybody has asked for this
 
01:35:30.350 --> 01:35:30.360 align:start position:0%
extension and like I said that our
 
01:35:33.590 --> 01:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
requirement is applicable and it ends in
 
01:35:38.990 --> 01:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.990 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:35:45.050 --> 01:35:45.060 align:start position:0%
Madam chairman yes just for the
 
01:35:48.530 --> 01:35:48.540 align:start position:0%
committee's edification FYI Betsy Patton
 
01:35:51.290 --> 01:35:51.300 align:start position:0%
who is testifying his long-term house a
 
01:35:53.629 --> 01:35:53.639 align:start position:0%
former long-term House member and did
 
01:35:55.310 --> 01:35:55.320 align:start position:0%
several stints as chair and vice chair
 
01:35:58.550 --> 01:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
of Joker right
 
01:36:00.830 --> 01:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
this is the old stomping grounds this is
 
01:36:03.169 --> 01:36:03.179 align:start position:0%
good this is Betsy I'm Betsy Patton and
 
01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
I'm the chairman of the assessing
 
01:36:08.149 --> 01:36:08.159 align:start position:0%
Standards Board and I hope that my vice
 
01:36:10.570 --> 01:36:10.580 align:start position:0%
chair Bob Gagnon will be able to explain
 
01:36:13.669 --> 01:36:13.679 align:start position:0%
exactly what's going on with the uh what
 
01:36:16.430 --> 01:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
you consider retroactive I just want to
 
01:36:19.970 --> 01:36:19.980 align:start position:0%
say that we um the previous rules that
 
01:36:24.709 --> 01:36:24.719 align:start position:0%
we went through started in 2019 and then
 
01:36:27.110 --> 01:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
of course the pandemic hit and we didn't
 
01:36:31.729 --> 01:36:31.739 align:start position:0%
see anybody until about 20 or 21 22 and
 
01:36:35.390 --> 01:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
so after our rules were approved in
 
01:36:40.430 --> 01:36:40.440 align:start position:0%
October of 21 we found that we had some
 
01:36:43.189 --> 01:36:43.199 align:start position:0%
outstanding issues and this is uh the
 
01:36:47.270 --> 01:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
one that that is of a concern to you so
 
01:36:49.669 --> 01:36:49.679 align:start position:0%
um I'll switch it over to Bob and see
 
01:36:52.149 --> 01:36:52.159 align:start position:0%
what he has today thank you
 
01:36:55.010 --> 01:36:55.020 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon I guess good morning
 
01:36:57.649 --> 01:36:57.659 align:start position:0%
Robert gagne I'm the vice chair of the
 
01:36:59.990 --> 01:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
assessing Standards Board I'd like to
 
01:37:01.970 --> 01:37:01.980 align:start position:0%
address whether this is a retroactive
 
01:37:05.209 --> 01:37:05.219 align:start position:0%
requirement the rules that were placed
 
01:37:06.169 --> 01:37:06.179 align:start position:0%
in effect
 
01:37:09.470 --> 01:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
as of October 21 actually require these
 
01:37:12.890 --> 01:37:12.900 align:start position:0%
individuals to have 50 hours of
 
01:37:15.890 --> 01:37:15.900 align:start position:0%
continuing education to recertify
 
01:37:18.110 --> 01:37:18.120 align:start position:0%
which was not our original intent the
 
01:37:20.629 --> 01:37:20.639 align:start position:0%
original intent was to be 50 hours on a
 
01:37:22.970 --> 01:37:22.980 align:start position:0%
five year and that's why we put in place
 
01:37:24.590 --> 01:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
this this
 
01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:25.149 align:start position:0%
this this
um

01:37:25.149 --> 01:37:25.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:29.330 --> 01:37:29.340 align:start position:0%
phase in for those
 
01:37:31.370 --> 01:37:31.380 align:start position:0%
questions so if I understand you
 
01:37:34.189 --> 01:37:34.199 align:start position:0%
correctly in 2021 you had a requirement
 
01:37:37.250 --> 01:37:37.260 align:start position:0%
for 50 hours of continuing education
 
01:37:40.010 --> 01:37:40.020 align:start position:0%
did the assessors whose certification
 
01:37:41.990 --> 01:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
expired that year
 
01:37:44.510 --> 01:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
get that education
 
01:37:46.550 --> 01:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
um several did not and they had to ask
 
01:37:48.530 --> 01:37:48.540 align:start position:0%
for an extension
 
01:37:50.990 --> 01:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
and and that wasn't that at the time
 
01:37:52.850 --> 01:37:52.860 align:start position:0%
that was a new requirement
 
01:37:54.770 --> 01:37:54.780 align:start position:0%
for this classification the the
 
01:37:57.370 --> 01:37:57.380 align:start position:0%
assistant now the other two
 
01:37:59.629 --> 01:37:59.639 align:start position:0%
classifications that require 50 hours
 
01:38:01.850 --> 01:38:01.860 align:start position:0%
that was not new
 
01:38:04.250 --> 01:38:04.260 align:start position:0%
um so that's why we're phasing it in the
 
01:38:08.390 --> 01:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
intent was if you if your renewal
 
01:38:10.490 --> 01:38:10.500 align:start position:0%
was only one year out
 
01:38:12.410 --> 01:38:12.420 align:start position:0%
you couldn't have had 50 hours because
 
01:38:14.149 --> 01:38:14.159 align:start position:0%
you didn't have any requirement prior to
 
01:38:17.149 --> 01:38:17.159 align:start position:0%
that to have a continuing education so
 
01:38:18.590 --> 01:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
that's why we put this in it and I
 
01:38:20.390 --> 01:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
believe there are some individuals who
 
01:38:22.570 --> 01:38:22.580 align:start position:0%
did ask for an extension
 
01:38:25.430 --> 01:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
where number one and two here would
 
01:38:28.669 --> 01:38:28.679 align:start position:0%
apply that they need 10 hours if they
 
01:38:32.149 --> 01:38:32.159 align:start position:0%
had expired in 21 and 20 hours if they
 
01:38:35.030 --> 01:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
expired in 22. uh the department I don't
 
01:38:36.770 --> 01:38:36.780 align:start position:0%
believe the department is here so I
 
01:38:38.450 --> 01:38:38.460 align:start position:0%
can't answer how many individuals it
 
01:38:38.460 --> 01:38:40.010 align:start position:0%
can't answer how many individuals it
affects

01:38:40.010 --> 01:38:40.020 align:start position:0%
affects
 
01:38:41.870 --> 01:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
um if if I recall from our initial
 
01:38:43.430 --> 01:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
discussions it was
 
01:38:47.030 --> 01:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
three for 2021 but I don't know how many
 
01:38:52.970 --> 01:38:52.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:56.629 --> 01:38:56.639 align:start position:0%
I would just like to add if we had um
 
01:38:59.030 --> 01:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
had this discussion and had put it in
 
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
the rules for um October 2021 we
 
01:39:04.129 --> 01:39:04.139 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have the we wouldn't have the
 
01:39:06.590 --> 01:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
issue today so
 
01:39:09.110 --> 01:39:09.120 align:start position:0%
um you can't always use the pandemic as
 
01:39:12.050 --> 01:39:12.060 align:start position:0%
an excuse but it happened so um I'm
 
01:39:14.629 --> 01:39:14.639 align:start position:0%
hoping that you will just approve our
 
01:39:16.610 --> 01:39:16.620 align:start position:0%
rules we're here for questions if you
 
01:39:17.750 --> 01:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
have any
 
01:39:20.990 --> 01:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
so if I understand correctly the 20 as
 
01:39:25.370 --> 01:39:25.380 align:start position:0%
of 2021 your rules required 50 hours and
 
01:39:28.250 --> 01:39:28.260 align:start position:0%
this is decreasing the requirement
 
01:39:32.510 --> 01:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
yes because we did not require the
 
01:39:35.629 --> 01:39:35.639 align:start position:0%
certified property assessor
 
01:39:35.639 --> 01:39:36.729 align:start position:0%
certified property assessor
assistant

01:39:36.729 --> 01:39:36.739 align:start position:0%
assistant
 
01:39:41.090 --> 01:39:41.100 align:start position:0%
to have to have 50 we added those in 21
 
01:39:44.209 --> 01:39:44.219 align:start position:0%
and then realized that we need to do a
 
01:39:47.450 --> 01:39:47.460 align:start position:0%
phase in okay thank you
 
01:39:49.669 --> 01:39:49.679 align:start position:0%
any other questions or representative
 
01:39:49.679 --> 01:39:51.590 align:start position:0%
any other questions or representative
Schmidt

01:39:51.590 --> 01:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
Schmidt
 
01:39:54.050 --> 01:39:54.060 align:start position:0%
my question is whether I have to recuse
 
01:39:55.850 --> 01:39:55.860 align:start position:0%
myself because I am a member of the
 
01:39:58.129 --> 01:39:58.139 align:start position:0%
assessing Standards Board as well so can
 
01:40:01.010 --> 01:40:01.020 align:start position:0%
I vote on this or not
 
01:40:03.950 --> 01:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
that's entirely up to you as long as you
 
01:40:06.470 --> 01:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh indicate that there's a possible
 
01:40:08.750 --> 01:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
conflict and make the committee members
 
01:40:11.149 --> 01:40:11.159 align:start position:0%
aware of it which you did then you may
 
01:40:13.310 --> 01:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
still vote as long as you're not you're
 
01:40:15.410 --> 01:40:15.420 align:start position:0%
actually a certified assessing assistant
 
01:40:17.510 --> 01:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
it's not going to make a difference I
 
01:40:19.790 --> 01:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
didn't think so but I'd rather ask and
 
01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:24.169 align:start position:0%
didn't think so but I'd rather ask and
absolutely

01:40:24.169 --> 01:40:24.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:24.179 --> 01:40:29.450 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:40:29.450 --> 01:40:29.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:38.570 --> 01:40:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:41.030 --> 01:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
I don't like the way it's written as if
 
01:40:43.370 --> 01:40:43.380 align:start position:0%
it were retroactive but I can understand
 
01:40:46.090 --> 01:40:46.100 align:start position:0%
your point that you're
 
01:40:49.669 --> 01:40:49.679 align:start position:0%
essentially forgiving if somebody
 
01:40:53.149 --> 01:40:53.159 align:start position:0%
uh their their certification expired in
 
01:40:57.070 --> 01:40:57.080 align:start position:0%
2021 your forgiving 40 hours of their
 
01:41:00.290 --> 01:41:00.300 align:start position:0%
requirement correct
 
01:41:04.010 --> 01:41:04.020 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead yeah yes
 
01:41:10.010 --> 01:41:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:12.350 --> 01:41:12.360 align:start position:0%
the fact that the requirement was 50
 
01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
hours for a year and a half
 
01:41:17.450 --> 01:41:17.460 align:start position:0%
makes a difference in what you're doing
 
01:41:20.330 --> 01:41:20.340 align:start position:0%
here I think I I don't quite know how to
 
01:41:25.010 --> 01:41:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:27.890 --> 01:41:27.900 align:start position:0%
the 50 hours were for two
 
01:41:31.970 --> 01:41:31.980 align:start position:0%
classifications of assessors
 
01:41:34.450 --> 01:41:34.460 align:start position:0%
the Third
 
01:41:39.709 --> 01:41:39.719 align:start position:0%
classification we added in 21 for 50. so
 
01:41:41.090 --> 01:41:41.100 align:start position:0%
they did not
 
01:41:44.330 --> 01:41:44.340 align:start position:0%
they were not required to have any
 
01:41:47.109 --> 01:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
continuing education until
 
01:41:51.109 --> 01:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
2021 that's why we phased it in no I I'm
 
01:41:54.530 --> 01:41:54.540 align:start position:0%
just saying that as of the currently
 
01:41:57.530 --> 01:41:57.540 align:start position:0%
effective rules they're required to have
 
01:42:00.770 --> 01:42:00.780 align:start position:0%
50 hours of continuing education and
 
01:42:03.709 --> 01:42:03.719 align:start position:0%
your wave and they could ask for a delay
 
01:42:07.310 --> 01:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
and your want to waive some portion of
 
01:42:09.790 --> 01:42:09.800 align:start position:0%
that continuing education is that
 
01:42:12.229 --> 01:42:12.239 align:start position:0%
understanding correct yes
 
01:42:16.070 --> 01:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
yes okay representative so I'm I'm not
 
01:42:18.229 --> 01:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
sure that I completely understand so I
 
01:42:20.510 --> 01:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
guess my question is this is there
 
01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:21.770 align:start position:0%
guess my question is this is there
anybody

01:42:21.770 --> 01:42:21.780 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
01:42:21.780 --> 01:42:22.970 align:start position:0%
anybody
that

01:42:22.970 --> 01:42:22.980 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:42:25.729 --> 01:42:25.739 align:start position:0%
as if this rule is adopted
 
01:42:29.870 --> 01:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
is there anybody that was not
 
01:42:33.350 --> 01:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
required to have any continuing legal
 
01:42:36.590 --> 01:42:36.600 align:start position:0%
education I'm legal education assessor
 
01:42:40.070 --> 01:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
education in 2021
 
01:42:42.890 --> 01:42:42.900 align:start position:0%
or in 2022
 
01:42:46.010 --> 01:42:46.020 align:start position:0%
that would now be required to have that
 
01:42:48.350 --> 01:42:48.360 align:start position:0%
continuing education for those years
 
01:42:50.570 --> 01:42:50.580 align:start position:0%
no they would have been required to have
 
01:42:52.910 --> 01:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
50 now they're being required to have 10
 
01:42:55.970 --> 01:42:55.980 align:start position:0%
or 20. I thought you said I I just wanna
 
01:42:58.129 --> 01:42:58.139 align:start position:0%
I thought you said there were
 
01:42:59.930 --> 01:42:59.940 align:start position:0%
um there was there was there were three
 
01:43:03.050 --> 01:43:03.060 align:start position:0%
categories and one category did not have
 
01:43:04.790 --> 01:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
any continuing education requirement
 
01:43:08.330 --> 01:43:08.340 align:start position:0%
prior to them adopting the rules in 2021
 
01:43:12.169 --> 01:43:12.179 align:start position:0%
right prior to 21. okay but you I see
 
01:43:13.970 --> 01:43:13.980 align:start position:0%
but you did adopt him you did adopt
 
01:43:15.290 --> 01:43:15.300 align:start position:0%
those rules for that for all three
 
01:43:18.410 --> 01:43:18.420 align:start position:0%
categories in 2021 yes okay I'm sorry
 
01:43:19.490 --> 01:43:19.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:43:19.500 --> 01:43:21.050 align:start position:0%

01:44:24.950 --> 01:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
that's on page four of the um uh final
 
01:44:27.770 --> 01:44:27.780 align:start position:0%
proposal packet and that's page one of
 
01:44:30.830 --> 01:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
the rule this proposal re-adopts rules
 
01:44:32.629 --> 01:44:32.639 align:start position:0%
that regulate emissions from Motor
 
01:44:36.189 --> 01:44:36.199 align:start position:0%
Vehicles this one substantive comment
 
01:44:39.290 --> 01:44:39.300 align:start position:0%
requires that um well the comments there
 
01:44:41.209 --> 01:44:41.219 align:start position:0%
because um it looks like it can't be
 
01:44:43.790 --> 01:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
uniformly applied and what we mean is
 
01:44:45.470 --> 01:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
that the rule requires owners of
 
01:44:48.109 --> 01:44:48.119 align:start position:0%
vehicles to adhere to certain idling
 
01:44:48.119 --> 01:44:49.550 align:start position:0%
vehicles to adhere to certain idling
limitations

01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
limitations
 
01:44:52.010 --> 01:44:52.020 align:start position:0%
however it looks like it's not possible
 
01:44:55.310 --> 01:44:55.320 align:start position:0%
for the agency to uniformly enforce the
 
01:44:57.890 --> 01:44:57.900 align:start position:0%
idling requirements and thus the rule
 
01:44:59.450 --> 01:44:59.460 align:start position:0%
may be contrary to public interest
 
01:45:02.149 --> 01:45:02.159 align:start position:0%
because of that lack of ability to be
 
01:45:03.890 --> 01:45:03.900 align:start position:0%
able to uniformly enforce the
 
01:45:06.470 --> 01:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
requirements and this issue has been
 
01:45:08.870 --> 01:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
presented before to the committee and
 
01:45:10.550 --> 01:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
the rules were approved despite the
 
01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:19.430 align:start position:0%
the rules were approved despite the
concern

01:45:19.430 --> 01:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:21.530 --> 01:45:21.540 align:start position:0%
good morning Sharon members of the
 
01:45:23.149 --> 01:45:23.159 align:start position:0%
committee Mike Fitzgerald I'm the
 
01:45:24.830 --> 01:45:24.840 align:start position:0%
assistant director of the Resources
 
01:45:25.970 --> 01:45:25.980 align:start position:0%
Division at the Department of
 
01:45:28.550 --> 01:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services
 
01:45:30.830 --> 01:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
um I have a few comments if you please
 
01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:32.689 align:start position:0%
um I have a few comments if you please
certainly

01:45:32.689 --> 01:45:32.699 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:45:34.129 --> 01:45:34.139 align:start position:0%
um as was mentioned these rules have
 
01:45:37.250 --> 01:45:37.260 align:start position:0%
been in effect for some some time the
 
01:45:40.129 --> 01:45:40.139 align:start position:0%
department uh does agree that we have
 
01:45:43.550 --> 01:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
limited resources uh many other states
 
01:45:47.090 --> 01:45:47.100 align:start position:0%
that have uh either either statutes or
 
01:45:49.729 --> 01:45:49.739 align:start position:0%
rules regarding idling of vehicles
 
01:45:49.739 --> 01:45:51.229 align:start position:0%
rules regarding idling of vehicles
uh

01:45:51.229 --> 01:45:51.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:45:53.629 --> 01:45:53.639 align:start position:0%
their agencies have kind of sort of
 
01:45:55.189 --> 01:45:55.199 align:start position:0%
ticketing Authority where they could go
 
01:45:59.090 --> 01:45:59.100 align:start position:0%
out observe a vehicle idling and
 
01:46:01.850 --> 01:46:01.860 align:start position:0%
issue an issue a ticket we don't have
 
01:46:04.490 --> 01:46:04.500 align:start position:0%
that Authority here in New Hampshire
 
01:46:07.669 --> 01:46:07.679 align:start position:0%
um and we would have to put any
 
01:46:11.030 --> 01:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
any violation of these rules through the
 
01:46:13.010 --> 01:46:13.020 align:start position:0%
same administrative procedures as we
 
01:46:15.290 --> 01:46:15.300 align:start position:0%
would put for a violation that a power
 
01:46:18.010 --> 01:46:18.020 align:start position:0%
plant or or a large Industrial Source
 
01:46:21.229 --> 01:46:21.239 align:start position:0%
puts into place so
 
01:46:23.689 --> 01:46:23.699 align:start position:0%
um we we do have limited resources
 
01:46:27.350 --> 01:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
however these rules are very
 
01:46:29.229 --> 01:46:29.239 align:start position:0%
um helpful
 
01:46:33.109 --> 01:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
we receive complaints probably somewhere
 
01:46:35.510 --> 01:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
between five and ten possibly more
 
01:46:38.149 --> 01:46:38.159 align:start position:0%
complaints uh a year
 
01:46:42.530 --> 01:46:42.540 align:start position:0%
from generally neighbors uh or or you
 
01:46:43.970 --> 01:46:43.980 align:start position:0%
know people who have trucks or school
 
01:46:47.390 --> 01:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
buses that they keep at their homes and
 
01:46:49.310 --> 01:46:49.320 align:start position:0%
they might go out and start the truck at
 
01:46:50.870 --> 01:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
six in the morning and let it sit for an
 
01:46:52.370 --> 01:46:52.380 align:start position:0%
hour while they have breakfast or
 
01:46:54.229 --> 01:46:54.239 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
01:46:57.410 --> 01:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
um and so our uh we we receive
 
01:47:00.229 --> 01:47:00.239 align:start position:0%
complaints these rules are helpful we
 
01:47:03.229 --> 01:47:03.239 align:start position:0%
generally can go out and and or make a
 
01:47:06.410 --> 01:47:06.420 align:start position:0%
phone call and uh
 
01:47:08.390 --> 01:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
speak to the individual that's
 
01:47:11.090 --> 01:47:11.100 align:start position:0%
responsible and and remind them that
 
01:47:15.350 --> 01:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
there are rules and and that these uh
 
01:47:17.090 --> 01:47:17.100 align:start position:0%
you know they can't continue that
 
01:47:19.010 --> 01:47:19.020 align:start position:0%
practice and that generally resolves
 
01:47:21.470 --> 01:47:21.480 align:start position:0%
things we don't we're not forced into
 
01:47:25.189 --> 01:47:25.199 align:start position:0%
going to uh administrative procedures
 
01:47:27.229 --> 01:47:27.239 align:start position:0%
and enforcement fines and that sort of
 
01:47:29.330 --> 01:47:29.340 align:start position:0%
thing second
 
01:47:31.970 --> 01:47:31.980 align:start position:0%
um we also get calls from municipalities
 
01:47:35.209 --> 01:47:35.219 align:start position:0%
many states have situations where the
 
01:47:37.250 --> 01:47:37.260 align:start position:0%
municipalities can enforce these type of
 
01:47:40.910 --> 01:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
rules where local law enforcement again
 
01:47:43.010 --> 01:47:43.020 align:start position:0%
that's not the case in New Hampshire
 
01:47:43.020 --> 01:47:45.109 align:start position:0%
that's not the case in New Hampshire
and

01:47:45.109 --> 01:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:48.770 --> 01:47:48.780 align:start position:0%
um so we do get calls from them uh we
 
01:47:50.870 --> 01:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
certainly inform them we'll send them a
 
01:47:52.550 --> 01:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
copy of the rule and then they can go
 
01:47:54.530 --> 01:47:54.540 align:start position:0%
out and speak to the individual
 
01:47:56.149 --> 01:47:56.159 align:start position:0%
um where the complaint is and we're
 
01:47:58.250 --> 01:47:58.260 align:start position:0%
sending their you know Health officer or
 
01:48:00.350 --> 01:48:00.360 align:start position:0%
whatever and let them know that there is
 
01:48:03.109 --> 01:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
a state rule that prevents this type of
 
01:48:05.990 --> 01:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
type of behavior and last
 
01:48:08.990 --> 01:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
um around schools we uh have had a very
 
01:48:10.729 --> 01:48:10.739 align:start position:0%
successful program over the past 10
 
01:48:12.790 --> 01:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
years or so where we have supplied
 
01:48:15.490 --> 01:48:15.500 align:start position:0%
signage to schools
 
01:48:18.169 --> 01:48:18.179 align:start position:0%
particularly when parents are queued up
 
01:48:22.729 --> 01:48:22.739 align:start position:0%
waiting for uh uh school school to get
 
01:48:25.850 --> 01:48:25.860 align:start position:0%
out or or in the morning to to drop off
 
01:48:25.860 --> 01:48:27.290 align:start position:0%
out or or in the morning to to drop off
students

01:48:27.290 --> 01:48:27.300 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:48:31.129 --> 01:48:31.139 align:start position:0%
um and and indicating that idling's not
 
01:48:33.050 --> 01:48:33.060 align:start position:0%
allowed I will point out that the rules
 
01:48:35.209 --> 01:48:35.219 align:start position:0%
do allow for idling in certain
 
01:48:37.790 --> 01:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
situations in which air conditioning and
 
01:48:41.270 --> 01:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
or or heating is is necessary we do do
 
01:48:44.209 --> 01:48:44.219 align:start position:0%
allow for certain waivers
 
01:48:46.010 --> 01:48:46.020 align:start position:0%
during during those periods so we're not
 
01:48:48.070 --> 01:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
but certainly
 
01:48:50.689 --> 01:48:50.699 align:start position:0%
schools have we've had a very successful
 
01:48:52.910 --> 01:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
situation where schools have requested
 
01:48:56.030 --> 01:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
these signs put them up and it has
 
01:48:58.070 --> 01:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
significantly reduced idling around the
 
01:49:00.050 --> 01:49:00.060 align:start position:0%
school schools and
 
01:49:02.870 --> 01:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
um assisting with the prevention of
 
01:49:07.850 --> 01:49:07.860 align:start position:0%
Health impacts to students so um I I
 
01:49:10.930 --> 01:49:10.940 align:start position:0%
don't think that the ability to enforce
 
01:49:13.790 --> 01:49:13.800 align:start position:0%
is is certainly an issue we agree but we
 
01:49:16.129 --> 01:49:16.139 align:start position:0%
think these rules are helpful and would
 
01:49:23.109 --> 01:49:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:25.729 --> 01:49:25.739 align:start position:0%
representative lamb um thank you madam
 
01:49:27.229 --> 01:49:27.239 align:start position:0%
chair and uh thank you for that
 
01:49:27.239 --> 01:49:28.609 align:start position:0%
chair and uh thank you for that
information

01:49:28.609 --> 01:49:28.619 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:49:34.189 --> 01:49:34.199 align:start position:0%
um looking at this rule um in 110203
 
01:49:36.350 --> 01:49:36.360 align:start position:0%
C2 that seems to be what you're
 
01:49:38.810 --> 01:49:38.820 align:start position:0%
referring to it's atop a page two of the
 
01:49:40.910 --> 01:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
rule about supplying heater air
 
01:49:42.470 --> 01:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
conditioning necessary for passenger
 
01:49:44.330 --> 01:49:44.340 align:start position:0%
Comfort right however if that's the case
 
01:49:46.910 --> 01:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
we should perhaps strike this where that
 
01:49:48.410 --> 01:49:48.420 align:start position:0%
continues to say that that's for in
 
01:49:49.970 --> 01:49:49.980 align:start position:0%
those Vehicles intended for commercial
 
01:49:53.030 --> 01:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
passenger Transportation I do know that
 
01:49:55.189 --> 01:49:55.199 align:start position:0%
my cars do not cool down sufficiently
 
01:49:56.870 --> 01:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
for it to be safe for my children in
 
01:49:59.870 --> 01:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
only five minutes so that is also a
 
01:50:02.209 --> 01:50:02.219 align:start position:0%
public interest issue if we're not able
 
01:50:04.189 --> 01:50:04.199 align:start position:0%
to reduce the car temperature to a safe
 
01:50:07.250 --> 01:50:07.260 align:start position:0%
temperature before putting children in
 
01:50:08.810 --> 01:50:08.820 align:start position:0%
I don't believe we would object to
 
01:50:10.750 --> 01:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
making that
 
01:50:15.169 --> 01:50:15.179 align:start position:0%
change all right thank you other
 
01:50:15.179 --> 01:50:16.370 align:start position:0%
change all right thank you other
questions

01:50:16.370 --> 01:50:16.380 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:50:19.129 --> 01:50:19.139 align:start position:0%
and that was just to strike the word
 
01:50:19.139 --> 01:50:22.970 align:start position:0%
and that was just to strike the word
commercial

01:50:22.970 --> 01:50:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:25.129 --> 01:50:25.139 align:start position:0%
to strike I believe striking the word
 
01:50:26.590 --> 01:50:26.600 align:start position:0%
commercial would be sufficient
 
01:50:26.600 --> 01:50:27.830 align:start position:0%
commercial would be sufficient

passenger transportation is what the
 
01:50:32.030 --> 01:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
issue is representative Leon you have a
 
01:50:35.149 --> 01:50:35.159 align:start position:0%
motion yes I moved to would it be a
 
01:50:37.010 --> 01:50:37.020 align:start position:0%
motion to conditionally accept the rules
 
01:50:40.310 --> 01:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
with that edit yes so moved
 
01:50:42.649 --> 01:50:42.659 align:start position:0%
okay seconded by representative Schmidt
 
01:50:46.370 --> 01:50:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:49.490 --> 01:50:49.500 align:start position:0%
okay those in favor
 
01:50:50.810 --> 01:50:50.820 align:start position:0%
aye opposed
 
01:50:52.250 --> 01:50:52.260 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:51:06.830 --> 01:51:06.840 align:start position:0%

20 23 96 is on PLC 1200 these rules
 
01:51:17.450 --> 01:51:17.460 align:start position:0%
relate to or relative to establishing
 
01:51:20.330 --> 01:51:20.340 align:start position:0%
the licensing requirements for court
 
01:51:22.550 --> 01:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
reporters and
 
01:51:24.649 --> 01:51:24.659 align:start position:0%
um as you are probably aware the court
 
01:51:26.870 --> 01:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
reporters board was changed to an
 
01:51:30.770 --> 01:51:30.780 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board to the oplc currently
 
01:51:32.629 --> 01:51:32.639 align:start position:0%
there are interim rules that are in
 
01:51:34.729 --> 01:51:34.739 align:start position:0%
effect and they expire
 
01:51:37.330 --> 01:51:37.340 align:start position:0%
um in July 31st
 
01:51:41.270 --> 01:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
there are one comment on the records
 
01:51:43.270 --> 01:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
retention issue which we've talked about
 
01:51:46.490 --> 01:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
at previous meetings and that's relative
 
01:51:49.790 --> 01:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
to the filing of the the old boards
 
01:51:52.490 --> 01:51:52.500 align:start position:0%
records maintaining those files so I
 
01:51:54.649 --> 01:51:54.659 align:start position:0%
wasn't going to spend any time on that
 
01:51:56.270 --> 01:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
comment since we've talked about that
 
01:51:57.830 --> 01:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
before and you're aware of the issue and
 
01:51:59.390 --> 01:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
I believe there's some legislation to
 
01:52:00.530 --> 01:52:00.540 align:start position:0%
address that
 
01:52:02.810 --> 01:52:02.820 align:start position:0%
that said there are two main issues to
 
01:52:05.390 --> 01:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
talk about and I'll take the easier or
 
01:52:07.330 --> 01:52:07.340 align:start position:0%
the two first
 
01:52:12.890 --> 01:52:12.900 align:start position:0%
and that is first on page 21 and 15 of
 
01:52:14.209 --> 01:52:14.219 align:start position:0%
The Proposal
 
01:52:16.790 --> 01:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
there are two rule sections here that
 
01:52:20.450 --> 01:52:20.460 align:start position:0%
talk about that an applicant can appeal
 
01:52:23.209 --> 01:52:23.219 align:start position:0%
a conditional denial but I don't see
 
01:52:25.490 --> 01:52:25.500 align:start position:0%
anything in the proposal that describes
 
01:52:28.129 --> 01:52:28.139 align:start position:0%
when the agency would issue a
 
01:52:30.590 --> 01:52:30.600 align:start position:0%
conditional denial rather than a
 
01:52:33.729 --> 01:52:33.739 align:start position:0%
straight out denial I don't see any
 
01:52:37.070 --> 01:52:37.080 align:start position:0%
criteria around that what the agency
 
01:52:39.410 --> 01:52:39.420 align:start position:0%
will use to make that determination to
 
01:52:42.290 --> 01:52:42.300 align:start position:0%
issue that conditional denial and that's
 
01:52:44.570 --> 01:52:44.580 align:start position:0%
a concern because that can result in an
 
01:52:46.850 --> 01:52:46.860 align:start position:0%
unfair application of criteria that's
 
01:52:49.970 --> 01:52:49.980 align:start position:0%
unknown and individuals will not know
 
01:52:53.209 --> 01:52:53.219 align:start position:0%
how that decision is made and that's
 
01:52:57.050 --> 01:52:57.060 align:start position:0%
really a violation of 541a and I'll stop
 
01:53:00.050 --> 01:53:00.060 align:start position:0%
there before we get into the next issue
 
01:53:01.790 --> 01:53:01.800 align:start position:0%
around fees
 
01:53:04.850 --> 01:53:04.860 align:start position:0%
so where what is a conditional denial of
 
01:53:04.860 --> 01:53:06.430 align:start position:0%
so where what is a conditional denial of
licensure

01:53:06.430 --> 01:53:06.440 align:start position:0%
licensure
 
01:53:09.770 --> 01:53:09.780 align:start position:0%
conditional up Douglas Ulster PLC
 
01:53:12.590 --> 01:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
general counsel forget where I was
 
01:53:12.600 --> 01:53:13.250 align:start position:0%
general counsel forget where I was
um

01:53:13.250 --> 01:53:13.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:14.689 --> 01:53:14.699 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so
 
01:53:16.550 --> 01:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
conditional denial licensure would be
 
01:53:18.410 --> 01:53:18.420 align:start position:0%
one of those sort of gray area issues
 
01:53:21.350 --> 01:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
there's the objective standards set by
 
01:53:23.870 --> 01:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
the board in the case of an Advisory
 
01:53:26.990 --> 01:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
Board in consultation with the board and
 
01:53:29.330 --> 01:53:29.340 align:start position:0%
the application would come into the lplc
 
01:53:30.770 --> 01:53:30.780 align:start position:0%
we go through the checklist that you
 
01:53:33.530 --> 01:53:33.540 align:start position:0%
meet the education the experience but
 
01:53:35.149 --> 01:53:35.159 align:start position:0%
you end up with those situations where
 
01:53:37.609 --> 01:53:37.619 align:start position:0%
someone may have say something in their
 
01:53:40.129 --> 01:53:40.139 align:start position:0%
criminal background check and under 332g
 
01:53:43.550 --> 01:53:43.560 align:start position:0%
you're only allowed to
 
01:53:43.560 --> 01:53:44.149 align:start position:0%
you're only allowed to
um

01:53:44.149 --> 01:53:44.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:46.250 --> 01:53:46.260 align:start position:0%
deny an application under certain
 
01:53:47.990 --> 01:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
standards it has to be substantially
 
01:53:49.970 --> 01:53:49.980 align:start position:0%
related that language might actually
 
01:53:54.410 --> 01:53:54.420 align:start position:0%
change in SB 107 but
 
01:53:57.709 --> 01:53:57.719 align:start position:0%
those kind of situations may require a
 
01:53:59.810 --> 01:53:59.820 align:start position:0%
more subject matter expertise point of
 
01:54:01.010 --> 01:54:01.020 align:start position:0%
view and those are the types of things
 
01:54:04.850 --> 01:54:04.860 align:start position:0%
we would bring to the board so the oplc
 
01:54:06.709 --> 01:54:06.719 align:start position:0%
would deny in the first instance but
 
01:54:08.450 --> 01:54:08.460 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be an actual denial until
 
01:54:10.790 --> 01:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
it went to the board the individual
 
01:54:12.169 --> 01:54:12.179 align:start position:0%
would have an opportunity to explain
 
01:54:14.030 --> 01:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
that criminal background check in that
 
01:54:16.669 --> 01:54:16.679 align:start position:0%
history and then depending on the
 
01:54:18.830 --> 01:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
board's decision either the license
 
01:54:21.830 --> 01:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
would be approved or an actual final
 
01:54:24.890 --> 01:54:24.900 align:start position:0%
denial would be issued and then we would
 
01:54:27.649 --> 01:54:27.659 align:start position:0%
file a denial letter which would have
 
01:54:31.070 --> 01:54:31.080 align:start position:0%
reasons and an opportunity notification
 
01:54:33.590 --> 01:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
of the right to appeal that decision so
 
01:54:35.450 --> 01:54:35.460 align:start position:0%
it's sort of those gray areas subject
 
01:54:38.030 --> 01:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
matter expertise situations so if I
 
01:54:39.910 --> 01:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
understand correctly a conditional
 
01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:41.810 align:start position:0%
understand correctly a conditional
[Music]

01:54:41.810 --> 01:54:41.820 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:54:44.870 --> 01:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
seek is not sure that the applicant is
 
01:54:46.850 --> 01:54:46.860 align:start position:0%
qualified and they refer to the board
 
01:54:52.010 --> 01:54:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:55.129 --> 01:54:55.139 align:start position:0%
yeah but that doesn't appear to be well
 
01:54:56.930 --> 01:54:56.940 align:start position:0%
defined in the rule
 
01:54:59.390 --> 01:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
I don't it may not be well defined in
 
01:55:01.370 --> 01:55:01.380 align:start position:0%
the role I think the rule can't be read
 
01:55:04.609 --> 01:55:04.619 align:start position:0%
in a vacuum because of uh 655
 
01:55:06.709 --> 01:55:06.719 align:start position:0%
legislation that's moving forward and
 
01:55:10.490 --> 01:55:10.500 align:start position:0%
the PLC 200s the PLC 300s and there are
 
01:55:12.050 --> 01:55:12.060 align:start position:0%
references to other rules that have
 
01:55:13.970 --> 01:55:13.980 align:start position:0%
already been approved by the gel car in
 
01:55:17.510 --> 01:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
this role so it might not be here but
 
01:55:20.209 --> 01:55:20.219 align:start position:0%
the references are to otherwise approved
 
01:55:20.219 --> 01:55:27.129 align:start position:0%
the references are to otherwise approved
rules

01:55:27.129 --> 01:55:27.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:30.410 --> 01:55:30.420 align:start position:0%
would seem that um they could insert
 
01:55:33.530 --> 01:55:33.540 align:start position:0%
some language here that describes that
 
01:55:36.729 --> 01:55:36.739 align:start position:0%
you know if oplc you know conditionally
 
01:55:39.649 --> 01:55:39.659 align:start position:0%
denies because they need to consult The
 
01:55:42.109 --> 01:55:42.119 align:start position:0%
Advisory board that something like that
 
01:55:44.149 --> 01:55:44.159 align:start position:0%
could be stated in the role they don't
 
01:55:46.370 --> 01:55:46.380 align:start position:0%
at a high level they don't have to drill
 
01:55:49.910 --> 01:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
down into every instance of of why yeah
 
01:55:53.510 --> 01:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt so and the issue
 
01:55:56.390 --> 01:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
I think that we're looking at here is
 
01:55:58.090 --> 01:55:58.100 align:start position:0%
oral rulemaking
 
01:56:02.090 --> 01:56:02.100 align:start position:0%
and do we have to I'll be clear enough
 
01:56:05.090 --> 01:56:05.100 align:start position:0%
with regard to whether we have that or
 
01:56:05.100 --> 01:56:07.370 align:start position:0%
with regard to whether we have that or
not

01:56:07.370 --> 01:56:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:12.169 --> 01:56:12.179 align:start position:0%
I I think I agree that we we are instead
 
01:56:14.330 --> 01:56:14.340 align:start position:0%
of just bringing conditional denial up
 
01:56:17.149 --> 01:56:17.159 align:start position:0%
right here you ought to say that an
 
01:56:20.030 --> 01:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:22.609 --> 01:56:22.619 align:start position:0%
may be denied until the board has
 
01:56:24.590 --> 01:56:24.600 align:start position:0%
reviewed and approved it
 
01:56:26.510 --> 01:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
and that's what you call a conditional
 
01:56:29.689 --> 01:56:29.699 align:start position:0%
denial I I need to Define what it is
 
01:56:33.290 --> 01:56:33.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:33.300 --> 01:56:34.310 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:56:34.310 --> 01:56:34.320 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:56:36.530 --> 01:56:36.540 align:start position:0%
um I I think certainly that that could
 
01:56:39.229 --> 01:56:39.239 align:start position:0%
be inserted there we probably need to
 
01:56:40.970 --> 01:56:40.980 align:start position:0%
check with oblc to make sure that
 
01:56:42.709 --> 01:56:42.719 align:start position:0%
they're good with inserting that kind of
 
01:56:44.750 --> 01:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
language there it would go into two
 
01:56:47.030 --> 01:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
places like I said there are two
 
01:56:49.669 --> 01:56:49.679 align:start position:0%
sections one on page 15 and then one on
 
01:56:52.729 --> 01:56:52.739 align:start position:0%
page 21. we do have another issue to get
 
01:56:55.850 --> 01:56:55.860 align:start position:0%
to on the fees so you might end up
 
01:56:57.950 --> 01:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
postponing or you might end up doing
 
01:57:00.530 --> 01:57:00.540 align:start position:0%
something different but just FYI on that
 
01:57:04.010 --> 01:57:04.020 align:start position:0%
okay well let's we've expressed Our
 
01:57:07.070 --> 01:57:07.080 align:start position:0%
concern on this one okay so
 
01:57:10.490 --> 01:57:10.500 align:start position:0%
okay so um the next issue is on the fees
 
01:57:13.430 --> 01:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
and it impacts another proposal that's
 
01:57:15.550 --> 01:57:15.560 align:start position:0%
coming up next or
 
01:57:19.370 --> 01:57:19.380 align:start position:0%
one down on um on the agenda and that's
 
01:57:25.010 --> 01:57:25.020 align:start position:0%
22 or sorry 20 23 52.
 
01:57:28.370 --> 01:57:28.380 align:start position:0%
um so as you may recall OLS and the
 
01:57:30.709 --> 01:57:30.719 align:start position:0%
committee has long considered licensing
 
01:57:33.649 --> 01:57:33.659 align:start position:0%
fees to be refundable and application
 
01:57:37.129 --> 01:57:37.139 align:start position:0%
fees to be non-refundable and over the
 
01:57:39.050 --> 01:57:39.060 align:start position:0%
past six to 12 months there has been a
 
01:57:40.490 --> 01:57:40.500 align:start position:0%
number of proposals that have been
 
01:57:43.490 --> 01:57:43.500 align:start position:0%
approved that contain citations to the
 
01:57:47.649 --> 01:57:47.659 align:start position:0%
fees and PLC 1002 which is
 
01:57:50.990 --> 01:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
2023-52 which is coming up on the agenda
 
01:57:54.350 --> 01:57:54.360 align:start position:0%
and those rules have been approved with
 
01:57:55.970 --> 01:57:55.980 align:start position:0%
the understanding that the fee rules
 
01:57:57.430 --> 01:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
would be moving forward
 
01:58:00.530 --> 01:58:00.540 align:start position:0%
but there's some language in those rules
 
01:58:02.990 --> 01:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
that state application processing fees
 
01:58:05.870 --> 01:58:05.880 align:start position:0%
are non-refundable as is happening here
 
01:58:08.830 --> 01:58:08.840 align:start position:0%
in 2023-96
 
01:58:11.270 --> 01:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
there's also language that states that
 
01:58:13.129 --> 01:58:13.139 align:start position:0%
those fees are non-refundable if the
 
01:58:14.930 --> 01:58:14.940 align:start position:0%
applicant withdrawals or abandons the
 
01:58:14.940 --> 01:58:16.189 align:start position:0%
applicant withdrawals or abandons the
application

01:58:16.189 --> 01:58:16.199 align:start position:0%
application
 
01:58:18.950 --> 01:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
when you're in when you review the
 
01:58:21.770 --> 01:58:21.780 align:start position:0%
language in 2020 352 you will see that
 
01:58:24.649 --> 01:58:24.659 align:start position:0%
the agency is equating licensing fees
 
01:58:26.870 --> 01:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
and application fees
 
01:58:30.229 --> 01:58:30.239 align:start position:0%
so um you should have in front of you a
 
01:58:32.510 --> 01:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
hard copy packet and we thought that
 
01:58:34.129 --> 01:58:34.139 align:start position:0%
would be a little easier to review
 
01:58:35.930 --> 01:58:35.940 align:start position:0%
instead of flipping back and forth
 
01:58:35.940 --> 01:58:36.970 align:start position:0%
instead of flipping back and forth
between

01:58:36.970 --> 01:58:36.980 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:58:40.490 --> 01:58:40.500 align:start position:0%
96 and 52 if you will
 
01:58:42.470 --> 01:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
um and so you're going to want to take a
 
01:58:44.930 --> 01:58:44.940 align:start position:0%
look at that if you look at the first
 
01:58:48.050 --> 01:58:48.060 align:start position:0%
page here you'll see this is Page 4 of
 
01:58:51.770 --> 01:58:51.780 align:start position:0%
96 and you'll see that it says an
 
01:58:54.830 --> 01:58:54.840 align:start position:0%
application processing fee of 155
 
01:58:54.840 --> 01:58:56.689 align:start position:0%
application processing fee of 155
dollars

01:58:56.689 --> 01:58:56.699 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:58:59.149 --> 01:58:59.159 align:start position:0%
um the IP had previously just referred
 
01:59:03.830 --> 01:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
over to 1002 PLC 1002 for the
 
01:59:06.770 --> 01:59:06.780 align:start position:0%
application fee if you flip to the next
 
01:59:09.109 --> 01:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
page here you'll see the relevant
 
01:59:13.510 --> 01:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
section of 53 or 52
 
01:59:17.629 --> 01:59:17.639 align:start position:0%
2023-52 which has the the section so it
 
01:59:21.830 --> 01:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
has this table here table 1002.10 it's
 
01:59:25.550 --> 01:59:25.560 align:start position:0%
titled application related fees for
 
01:59:27.649 --> 01:59:27.659 align:start position:0%
professions regulated by the executive
 
01:59:30.530 --> 01:59:30.540 align:start position:0%
director with the advisory Court Board
 
01:59:32.750 --> 01:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
of court reporters if you look here it
 
01:59:34.250 --> 01:59:34.260 align:start position:0%
says court reporter licensing
 
01:59:37.669 --> 01:59:37.679 align:start position:0%
application processing as initial in a
 
01:59:40.250 --> 01:59:40.260 align:start position:0%
renewal and then a duration and then the
 
01:59:42.709 --> 01:59:42.719 align:start position:0%
fee amount looks pretty clear that these
 
01:59:46.430 --> 01:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
are licenses right you wouldn't have an
 
01:59:48.589 --> 01:59:48.599 align:start position:0%
application that has a two-year duration
 
01:59:51.290 --> 01:59:51.300 align:start position:0%
you have a license that has a two-year
 
01:59:51.300 --> 01:59:52.490 align:start position:0%
you have a license that has a two-year
duration

01:59:52.490 --> 01:59:52.500 align:start position:0%
duration
 
01:59:52.500 --> 01:59:53.750 align:start position:0%
duration
so

01:59:53.750 --> 01:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:59:53.760 --> 01:59:54.830 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:59:54.830 --> 01:59:54.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:57.050 --> 01:59:57.060 align:start position:0%
and so you know like I said with this
 
01:59:59.510 --> 01:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
construction it looks like that they're
 
02:00:02.689 --> 02:00:02.699 align:start position:0%
equating the application processing fees
 
02:00:05.810 --> 02:00:05.820 align:start position:0%
or the application fee and the licensing
 
02:00:05.820 --> 02:00:06.709 align:start position:0%
or the application fee and the licensing
fee

02:00:06.709 --> 02:00:06.719 align:start position:0%
fee
 
02:00:08.990 --> 02:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
and you know that might be okay for the
 
02:00:10.910 --> 02:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board of court reporters
 
02:00:13.129 --> 02:00:13.139 align:start position:0%
because the statute and that's your next
 
02:00:16.430 --> 02:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
page it states that the applicant shall
 
02:00:19.370 --> 02:00:19.380 align:start position:0%
pay fees for the application for a
 
02:00:22.129 --> 02:00:22.139 align:start position:0%
license it doesn't say they shall pay a
 
02:00:24.770 --> 02:00:24.780 align:start position:0%
fee for a license right it says they'll
 
02:00:26.990 --> 02:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
pay for an application
 
02:00:29.990 --> 02:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
and as I previously said this this issue
 
02:00:32.089 --> 02:00:32.099 align:start position:0%
impact impacts other proposals currently
 
02:00:34.790 --> 02:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
in rulemaking and some that have already
 
02:00:38.209 --> 02:00:38.219 align:start position:0%
been approved for example and that's
 
02:00:40.250 --> 02:00:40.260 align:start position:0%
your the next page it's going to have a
 
02:00:42.470 --> 02:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
a section from the statute on the board
 
02:00:43.930 --> 02:00:43.940 align:start position:0%
of Forestry
 
02:00:47.030 --> 02:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
so right now there is initial proposal
 
02:00:50.450 --> 02:00:50.460 align:start position:0%
for the board of Forestry and in that it
 
02:00:51.709 --> 02:00:51.719 align:start position:0%
does state that the fees are
 
02:00:53.990 --> 02:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
non-refundable however that statute that
 
02:00:56.930 --> 02:00:56.940 align:start position:0%
you have in front of you says that um
 
02:00:59.270 --> 02:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
it's pretty clear that only one half of
 
02:01:01.790 --> 02:01:01.800 align:start position:0%
that licensing fee shall be paid at
 
02:01:04.790 --> 02:01:04.800 align:start position:0%
application the other half gets paid
 
02:01:07.250 --> 02:01:07.260 align:start position:0%
whenever they get approved and when they
 
02:01:09.290 --> 02:01:09.300 align:start position:0%
want to get their license
 
02:01:12.410 --> 02:01:12.420 align:start position:0%
only does that half of that fee become
 
02:01:15.169 --> 02:01:15.179 align:start position:0%
an application fee if the license is
 
02:01:15.179 --> 02:01:16.370 align:start position:0%
an application fee if the license is
denied

02:01:16.370 --> 02:01:16.380 align:start position:0%
denied
 
02:01:19.129 --> 02:01:19.139 align:start position:0%
now currently they have a IP that's you
 
02:01:21.050 --> 02:01:21.060 align:start position:0%
know in process that says that the
 
02:01:22.910 --> 02:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
application processing fees are all
 
02:01:25.370 --> 02:01:25.380 align:start position:0%
non-refundable but clearly the statute
 
02:01:27.410 --> 02:01:27.420 align:start position:0%
doesn't state that
 
02:01:27.420 --> 02:01:28.609 align:start position:0%
doesn't state that
so

02:01:28.609 --> 02:01:28.619 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:01:31.430 --> 02:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
um you know we were going to recommend
 
02:01:34.729 --> 02:01:34.739 align:start position:0%
that perhaps The Proposal the fee
 
02:01:38.570 --> 02:01:38.580 align:start position:0%
proposal 2020 352 be postponed until
 
02:01:41.689 --> 02:01:41.699 align:start position:0%
oplc can go through and make sure that
 
02:01:44.629 --> 02:01:44.639 align:start position:0%
what's being included there actually
 
02:01:47.330 --> 02:01:47.340 align:start position:0%
lines up with the statutes but again to
 
02:01:47.340 --> 02:01:48.350 align:start position:0%
lines up with the statutes but again to
summarize

02:01:48.350 --> 02:01:48.360 align:start position:0%
summarize
 
02:01:50.089 --> 02:01:50.099 align:start position:0%
um you know calling the fees for court
 
02:01:52.250 --> 02:01:52.260 align:start position:0%
reporters application processing fees
 
02:01:54.649 --> 02:01:54.659 align:start position:0%
might be okay because of the way that
 
02:01:56.629 --> 02:01:56.639 align:start position:0%
statute reads but it's not going to be
 
02:01:59.149 --> 02:01:59.159 align:start position:0%
okay for every single other board that's
 
02:02:02.390 --> 02:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
listed in 52. I I just highlighted one
 
02:02:04.550 --> 02:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
and that was on the Foresters I think
 
02:02:07.250 --> 02:02:07.260 align:start position:0%
there's also an issue with mert the
 
02:02:10.010 --> 02:02:10.020 align:start position:0%
medical imaging radiation board as well
 
02:02:12.410 --> 02:02:12.420 align:start position:0%
there might be some others but we don't
 
02:02:13.850 --> 02:02:13.860 align:start position:0%
have the bandwidth right now to go
 
02:02:16.189 --> 02:02:16.199 align:start position:0%
through every single one and check all
 
02:02:18.290 --> 02:02:18.300 align:start position:0%
the fees and there is some
 
02:02:20.229 --> 02:02:20.239 align:start position:0%
some squishiness if you will around
 
02:02:22.910 --> 02:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
reinstatement fees what does the statute
 
02:02:25.550 --> 02:02:25.560 align:start position:0%
say about that is that a application fee
 
02:02:29.390 --> 02:02:29.400 align:start position:0%
or is that a license fee so yeah that's
 
02:02:31.729 --> 02:02:31.739 align:start position:0%
kind of a high level of what's going on
 
02:02:35.930 --> 02:02:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:38.530 --> 02:02:38.540 align:start position:0%
oh perhaps
 
02:02:42.470 --> 02:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
ah well let's see if we can
 
02:02:44.570 --> 02:02:44.580 align:start position:0%
deal with the court reporters first
 
02:02:49.129 --> 02:02:49.139 align:start position:0%
while we mull over this fee issue so is
 
02:02:49.139 --> 02:02:51.470 align:start position:0%
while we mull over this fee issue so is
the

02:02:51.470 --> 02:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:02:51.480 --> 02:02:52.250 align:start position:0%
the
um

02:02:52.250 --> 02:02:52.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:54.589 --> 02:02:54.599 align:start position:0%
in the court in the court reporter rule
 
02:02:57.530 --> 02:02:57.540 align:start position:0%
96 is that
 
02:02:59.689 --> 02:02:59.699 align:start position:0%
does that include non-refundable
 
02:03:02.149 --> 02:03:02.159 align:start position:0%
application fees it does and like I said
 
02:03:03.770 --> 02:03:03.780 align:start position:0%
the statute there says that they're
 
02:03:05.750 --> 02:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
paying for an application for a license
 
02:03:08.510 --> 02:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
and there's another section that it it
 
02:03:11.209 --> 02:03:11.219 align:start position:0%
like I said it's a little unclear but it
 
02:03:13.070 --> 02:03:13.080 align:start position:0%
could be that when they renew they're
 
02:03:15.109 --> 02:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
actually paying for the license and not
 
02:03:16.490 --> 02:03:16.500 align:start position:0%
for an application
 
02:03:19.129 --> 02:03:19.139 align:start position:0%
depends on how you how you interpret the
 
02:03:22.010 --> 02:03:22.020 align:start position:0%
statute well clearly the the application
 
02:03:25.310 --> 02:03:25.320 align:start position:0%
for license is allowed but then the
 
02:03:27.830 --> 02:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
renewal is not necessarily an
 
02:03:31.729 --> 02:03:31.739 align:start position:0%
application right so offhand I would say
 
02:03:33.169 --> 02:03:33.179 align:start position:0%
that the hundred dollars is the
 
02:03:36.470 --> 02:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
application fee in the 200 is a license
 
02:03:38.450 --> 02:03:38.460 align:start position:0%
fee but that's just my interpretation
 
02:03:38.460 --> 02:03:39.890 align:start position:0%
fee but that's just my interpretation
right

02:03:39.890 --> 02:03:39.900 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:03:44.350 --> 02:03:44.360 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the um 52
 
02:03:47.689 --> 02:03:47.699 align:start position:0%
on that table it has the renewal and
 
02:03:50.450 --> 02:03:50.460 align:start position:0%
then duration is 200 but you know this
 
02:03:53.629 --> 02:03:53.639 align:start position:0%
table is is you know titled application
 
02:03:56.810 --> 02:03:56.820 align:start position:0%
related fees so you know like I said
 
02:03:58.490 --> 02:03:58.500 align:start position:0%
they're they're kind of lumping
 
02:04:01.609 --> 02:04:01.619 align:start position:0%
Licensing and application fees you know
 
02:04:04.310 --> 02:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
together and so and then saying that
 
02:04:06.589 --> 02:04:06.599 align:start position:0%
they're all non-refundable and I think
 
02:04:09.169 --> 02:04:09.179 align:start position:0%
that's problematic
 
02:04:12.770 --> 02:04:12.780 align:start position:0%
thank you I agree any other questions or
 
02:04:12.780 --> 02:04:19.790 align:start position:0%
thank you I agree any other questions or
comments

02:04:19.790 --> 02:04:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:23.270 --> 02:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
yes if I can respond uh so the way the
 
02:04:25.430 --> 02:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
oplc treats it is that it is an
 
02:04:27.169 --> 02:04:27.179 align:start position:0%
application fee so if you're going to
 
02:04:29.510 --> 02:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
spend the 155 dollars you wouldn't send
 
02:04:32.510 --> 02:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
in your application for
 
02:04:34.669 --> 02:04:34.679 align:start position:0%
whatever the license type might be that
 
02:04:36.530 --> 02:04:36.540 align:start position:0%
initial application that would include a
 
02:04:38.750 --> 02:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
check hopefully not stapled to it but
 
02:04:40.729 --> 02:04:40.739 align:start position:0%
sometimes it happens
 
02:04:40.739 --> 02:04:41.390 align:start position:0%
sometimes it happens
um

02:04:41.390 --> 02:04:41.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:43.609 --> 02:04:43.619 align:start position:0%
for the application processing fee but
 
02:04:45.350 --> 02:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
renewals work the same way because
 
02:04:47.870 --> 02:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
there's also applications for renewal of
 
02:04:51.169 --> 02:04:51.179 align:start position:0%
licensures so they the fees even for
 
02:04:53.209 --> 02:04:53.219 align:start position:0%
renewals even further statements are
 
02:04:56.209 --> 02:04:56.219 align:start position:0%
application fees at the oplc they are
 
02:04:58.250 --> 02:04:58.260 align:start position:0%
not fees for licensure and we worked
 
02:05:01.669 --> 02:05:01.679 align:start position:0%
with doj on this issue to make sure we
 
02:05:04.370 --> 02:05:04.380 align:start position:0%
got the verbiage right because there is
 
02:05:06.470 --> 02:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
a concern about sort of the difference
 
02:05:08.450 --> 02:05:08.460 align:start position:0%
in non-refundable licenses for
 
02:05:12.530 --> 02:05:12.540 align:start position:0%
application fees versus a licensing fee
 
02:05:16.310 --> 02:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
and so that you have no licensing fees
 
02:05:17.930 --> 02:05:17.940 align:start position:0%
as far as I understand we have no
 
02:05:21.050 --> 02:05:21.060 align:start position:0%
licensing fees we have application fees
 
02:05:25.430 --> 02:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
or fees for application for a licensure
 
02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:28.370 align:start position:0%
or fees for application for a licensure
interesting

02:05:28.370 --> 02:05:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:28.380 --> 02:05:31.490 align:start position:0%
 
comments

02:05:31.490 --> 02:05:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:33.410 --> 02:05:33.420 align:start position:0%
I would point out that if you look at
 
02:05:35.390 --> 02:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
the licensing of Foresters in your
 
02:05:35.400 --> 02:05:36.670 align:start position:0%

um

02:05:37.729 --> 02:05:37.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:39.410 --> 02:05:39.420 align:start position:0%
if you go down to about the middle of
 
02:05:42.950 --> 02:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
the paragraph the fee for a license as a
 
02:05:45.229 --> 02:05:45.239 align:start position:0%
Forester shall be fixed by the board
 
02:05:47.149 --> 02:05:47.159 align:start position:0%
that doesn't say the fee for an
 
02:05:47.159 --> 02:05:49.010 align:start position:0%
that doesn't say the fee for an
application

02:05:49.010 --> 02:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
application
 
02:05:52.189 --> 02:05:52.199 align:start position:0%
yes so part of that could be part of our
 
02:05:54.770 --> 02:05:54.780 align:start position:0%
cleanup it's been the ongoing process
 
02:05:56.570 --> 02:05:56.580 align:start position:0%
that we've been Shifting the fees for
 
02:05:58.850 --> 02:05:58.860 align:start position:0%
the boards to the oplcs we made a lot of
 
02:06:01.490 --> 02:06:01.500 align:start position:0%
progress in that last year removing the
 
02:06:03.649 --> 02:06:03.659 align:start position:0%
specific fee setting Authority from the
 
02:06:07.010 --> 02:06:07.020 align:start position:0%
boards it is my understanding and I
 
02:06:09.470 --> 02:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
heard it said here at gelgar that it was
 
02:06:12.109 --> 02:06:12.119 align:start position:0%
the legislative intent for oblc to have
 
02:06:14.089 --> 02:06:14.099 align:start position:0%
the fee setting Authority so this that
 
02:06:16.189 --> 02:06:16.199 align:start position:0%
Forester piece I think would conflict
 
02:06:18.589 --> 02:06:18.599 align:start position:0%
with 655 as it was moved forward
 
02:06:21.169 --> 02:06:21.179 align:start position:0%
assuming it's signed which gives the
 
02:06:22.910 --> 02:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
office the fee setting Authority I think
 
02:06:27.050 --> 02:06:27.060 align:start position:0%
it's already there in RSA 310a1e
 
02:06:30.470 --> 02:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh and then I think the Forester piece
 
02:06:31.850 --> 02:06:31.860 align:start position:0%
would also be part of that cleanup
 
02:06:33.890 --> 02:06:33.900 align:start position:0%
project as we move forward
 
02:06:36.770 --> 02:06:36.780 align:start position:0%
um this fall as planned
 
02:06:38.990 --> 02:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
I think it may come down to whether or
 
02:06:42.830 --> 02:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
not the legislature agrees that um there
 
02:06:46.430 --> 02:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
are application fees or license fees
 
02:06:49.669 --> 02:06:49.679 align:start position:0%
right like I said with this forestry
 
02:06:52.550 --> 02:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
um statute it's pretty clear that only
 
02:06:54.890 --> 02:06:54.900 align:start position:0%
half of that fee is due at the time of
 
02:06:57.229 --> 02:06:57.239 align:start position:0%
application and the other half is due
 
02:06:59.750 --> 02:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
whenever they get their license if you
 
02:07:02.330 --> 02:07:02.340 align:start position:0%
look at that last line as there it says
 
02:07:04.430 --> 02:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
should the board deny the issue of a
 
02:07:06.530 --> 02:07:06.540 align:start position:0%
license to any applicant the fee
 
02:07:08.450 --> 02:07:08.460 align:start position:0%
deposited shall be retained by the board
 
02:07:11.209 --> 02:07:11.219 align:start position:0%
as an application fee it only becomes an
 
02:07:16.790 --> 02:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:16.800 --> 02:07:19.669 align:start position:0%
 
rather

02:07:19.669 --> 02:07:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:21.950 --> 02:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
well but the Forester thing doesn't
 
02:07:24.290 --> 02:07:24.300 align:start position:0%
affect the court reporters
 
02:07:29.050 --> 02:07:29.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:33.050 --> 02:07:33.060 align:start position:0%
I can't I I guess I
 
02:07:36.050 --> 02:07:36.060 align:start position:0%
it's hard for me to believe that the
 
02:07:39.290 --> 02:07:39.300 align:start position:0%
legislature really intended to draw a
 
02:07:41.510 --> 02:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
distinction between application and
 
02:07:44.089 --> 02:07:44.099 align:start position:0%
license in this context I mean I I agree
 
02:07:46.910 --> 02:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
that the the Forester one talks about
 
02:07:48.530 --> 02:07:48.540 align:start position:0%
um you only have to and I'm not quite
 
02:07:50.990 --> 02:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
sure why they did this but you only have
 
02:07:52.910 --> 02:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
to pay half of it in the uh when you
 
02:07:56.629 --> 02:07:56.639 align:start position:0%
when you make the application but he
 
02:07:59.030 --> 02:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
I just think that that trying to draw a
 
02:08:00.589 --> 02:08:00.599 align:start position:0%
distinction where we're sort of
 
02:08:03.169 --> 02:08:03.179 align:start position:0%
overthinking this it's an app it's yeah
 
02:08:06.830 --> 02:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's one feet that's well I could I
 
02:08:09.229 --> 02:08:09.239 align:start position:0%
can agree that if you have a higher fee
 
02:08:11.390 --> 02:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
for initial licensure than you do for
 
02:08:14.390 --> 02:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
renewal the difference is pretty clearly
 
02:08:17.689 --> 02:08:17.699 align:start position:0%
an application fee because in many cases
 
02:08:19.490 --> 02:08:19.500 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of things that have to
 
02:08:22.310 --> 02:08:22.320 align:start position:0%
be approved for initial licensure that
 
02:08:26.330 --> 02:08:26.340 align:start position:0%
do not have to be redone every time
 
02:08:30.410 --> 02:08:30.420 align:start position:0%
so that makes sense but the
 
02:08:33.350 --> 02:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
the renewal fee I'm not sure I see that
 
02:08:37.310 --> 02:08:37.320 align:start position:0%
as an application fee and I I have to to
 
02:08:39.830 --> 02:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
say that that the
 
02:08:39.840 --> 02:08:41.750 align:start position:0%
say that that the
um

02:08:41.750 --> 02:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:44.750 --> 02:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
the normal understanding in the
 
02:08:46.490 --> 02:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
legislatures the license fee is
 
02:08:49.010 --> 02:08:49.020 align:start position:0%
something you pay for the services of
 
02:08:51.770 --> 02:08:51.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:55.550 --> 02:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
and that you get benefits from it
 
02:08:55.560 --> 02:08:57.470 align:start position:0%
and that you get benefits from it
um

02:08:57.470 --> 02:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:00.830 --> 02:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
I think it's more just that well
 
02:09:04.729 --> 02:09:04.739 align:start position:0%
and for for example we just just passed
 
02:09:07.790 --> 02:09:07.800 align:start position:0%
a bill that said that the any surplus in
 
02:09:10.669 --> 02:09:10.679 align:start position:0%
the oplc fund will be used to reduce
 
02:09:13.790 --> 02:09:13.800 align:start position:0%
license fees well if they don't have any
 
02:09:16.129 --> 02:09:16.139 align:start position:0%
license fees what are you going to do
 
02:09:17.629 --> 02:09:17.639 align:start position:0%
with it
 
02:09:19.790 --> 02:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
oh Heather Kelly director of operations
 
02:09:19.800 --> 02:09:21.589 align:start position:0%
oh Heather Kelly director of operations
uh

02:09:21.589 --> 02:09:21.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:09:24.229 --> 02:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
to clarify application fees are
 
02:09:26.510 --> 02:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
considered the initial application fees
 
02:09:29.410 --> 02:09:29.420 align:start position:0%
those fees are the fees that we refund
 
02:09:31.729 --> 02:09:31.739 align:start position:0%
renewal restatement fees are not
 
02:09:31.739 --> 02:09:33.250 align:start position:0%
renewal restatement fees are not
considered

02:09:33.250 --> 02:09:33.260 align:start position:0%
considered
 
02:09:35.689 --> 02:09:35.699 align:start position:0%
application fees and we do refund those
 
02:09:38.149 --> 02:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
there are additional license fees that
 
02:09:40.250 --> 02:09:40.260 align:start position:0%
we collect the professional health
 
02:09:43.010 --> 02:09:43.020 align:start position:0%
program fee for example is considered a
 
02:09:45.410 --> 02:09:45.420 align:start position:0%
license fee we have a wall certificate
 
02:09:47.750 --> 02:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
fee verification those are not the
 
02:09:49.729 --> 02:09:49.739 align:start position:0%
issues right it sounds like there's a
 
02:09:52.550 --> 02:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
bit of confusion in the office I'm not
 
02:09:55.070 --> 02:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
the finance Guy this is why I brought
 
02:09:56.629 --> 02:09:56.639 align:start position:0%
Heather with me today I thought I was
 
02:09:58.189 --> 02:09:58.199 align:start position:0%
speaking correctly but I'm glad Heather
 
02:10:01.189 --> 02:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
came and corrected the record uh Lindsay
 
02:10:02.450 --> 02:10:02.460 align:start position:0%
would have been here because she and
 
02:10:04.490 --> 02:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
Heather typically do the the finance
 
02:10:06.290 --> 02:10:06.300 align:start position:0%
piece and I'm sort of subbing because
 
02:10:08.270 --> 02:10:08.280 align:start position:0%
she is in Alabama right now
 
02:10:11.390 --> 02:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
okay uh we're just going to point out
 
02:10:13.430 --> 02:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
that that's not the way it's set up in
 
02:10:16.189 --> 02:10:16.199 align:start position:0%
2020 352 and that includes for the court
 
02:10:18.410 --> 02:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
reporters they're like I said they're
 
02:10:20.390 --> 02:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
lumping them all together under the
 
02:10:23.450 --> 02:10:23.460 align:start position:0%
title application related and in the
 
02:10:24.950 --> 02:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
proposals they're saying that
 
02:10:26.750 --> 02:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
application processing fees are
 
02:10:29.089 --> 02:10:29.099 align:start position:0%
non-refundable period and that includes
 
02:10:31.669 --> 02:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
renewals okay well then case I think
 
02:10:35.810 --> 02:10:35.820 align:start position:0%
there's an issue in the in the
 
02:10:39.970 --> 02:10:39.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:44.030 --> 02:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
PLC 1002 to clarify the distinction
 
02:10:46.129 --> 02:10:46.139 align:start position:0%
between license fees and application
 
02:10:46.139 --> 02:10:47.870 align:start position:0%
between license fees and application
fees

02:10:47.870 --> 02:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
fees
 
02:10:49.669 --> 02:10:49.679 align:start position:0%
because we're getting two different
 
02:10:49.679 --> 02:10:51.950 align:start position:0%
because we're getting two different
stories

02:10:51.950 --> 02:10:51.960 align:start position:0%
stories
 
02:10:55.609 --> 02:10:55.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:57.950 --> 02:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
we are up against our deadline what is
 
02:11:01.310 --> 02:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
the current status of the rules
 
02:11:03.530 --> 02:11:03.540 align:start position:0%
sorry there are interim rules and they
 
02:11:06.050 --> 02:11:06.060 align:start position:0%
expire at the end of July
 
02:11:06.060 --> 02:11:10.970 align:start position:0%
expire at the end of July
um

02:11:10.970 --> 02:11:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:13.910 --> 02:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
court reporter ruled to the our July
 
02:11:13.920 --> 02:11:14.870 align:start position:0%
court reporter ruled to the our July
meeting

02:11:14.870 --> 02:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
02:11:17.930 --> 02:11:17.940 align:start position:0%
and get a waiver for it and also
 
02:11:17.940 --> 02:11:19.490 align:start position:0%
and get a waiver for it and also
postpone

02:11:19.490 --> 02:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
postpone
 
02:11:21.189 --> 02:11:21.199 align:start position:0%
the the
 
02:11:26.390 --> 02:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:28.870 --> 02:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
part of your motion still yes the
 
02:11:31.250 --> 02:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
postponed the two of them
 
02:11:34.189 --> 02:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
to clarify what's an application fee and
 
02:11:37.189 --> 02:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
what's a license fee because apparently
 
02:11:38.570 --> 02:11:38.580 align:start position:0%
there are some
 
02:11:41.270 --> 02:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
disagreement on what's what and we'll
 
02:11:46.490 --> 02:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:49.430 --> 02:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
okay okay any comment question on that
 
02:11:49.440 --> 02:11:51.609 align:start position:0%
okay okay any comment question on that
okay

02:11:51.609 --> 02:11:51.619 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:11:54.169 --> 02:11:54.179 align:start position:0%
those in favor
 
02:11:55.609 --> 02:11:55.619 align:start position:0%
aye opposed
 
02:11:59.089 --> 02:11:59.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:01.250 --> 02:12:01.260 align:start position:0%
we don't deny that there are application
 
02:12:03.649 --> 02:12:03.659 align:start position:0%
fees but they're not all application
 
02:12:03.659 --> 02:12:04.910 align:start position:0%
fees but they're not all application
fees

02:12:04.910 --> 02:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
fees
 
02:12:07.850 --> 02:12:07.860 align:start position:0%
all right and
 
02:12:11.629 --> 02:12:11.639 align:start position:0%
okay so the next one would be 20 23 51
 
02:12:15.470 --> 02:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
which is fees not for licensure but for
 
02:12:19.370 --> 02:12:19.380 align:start position:0%
the site visits and inspections that are
 
02:12:22.970 --> 02:12:22.980 align:start position:0%
not related to licensure and even though
 
02:12:25.850 --> 02:12:25.860 align:start position:0%
it is only a one-page proposal there are
 
02:12:27.830 --> 02:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
a number of comments on there just
 
02:12:31.070 --> 02:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
because we're facing the same issues as
 
02:12:33.290 --> 02:12:33.300 align:start position:0%
we are with the licensing fees about who
 
02:12:37.550 --> 02:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
has the authority to set those fees each
 
02:12:40.250 --> 02:12:40.260 align:start position:0%
board that is listed in this proposal I
 
02:12:42.290 --> 02:12:42.300 align:start position:0%
did cite the statute
 
02:12:44.629 --> 02:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
and for your information I will go
 
02:12:46.430 --> 02:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
through all of them yes but it does
 
02:12:47.810 --> 02:12:47.820 align:start position:0%
explain there's some conflicting
 
02:12:50.149 --> 02:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority and then
 
02:12:51.830 --> 02:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
additionally some of these boards also
 
02:12:54.709 --> 02:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
already have rules establishing fees for
 
02:12:56.689 --> 02:12:56.699 align:start position:0%
site visits and inspections so there'll
 
02:12:58.910 --> 02:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
also be a conflict if these rules were
 
02:13:00.109 --> 02:13:00.119 align:start position:0%
to go in effect
 
02:13:03.350 --> 02:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
the conflict in the rules this ought to
 
02:13:06.250 --> 02:13:06.260 align:start position:0%
include the
 
02:13:10.010 --> 02:13:10.020 align:start position:0%
delete the repeal of existing rules that
 
02:13:12.589 --> 02:13:12.599 align:start position:0%
have different fees or actually any fee
 
02:13:14.569 --> 02:13:14.579 align:start position:0%
just to make it simpler
 
02:13:17.209 --> 02:13:17.219 align:start position:0%
but I but I believe the statutory
 
02:13:19.669 --> 02:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
Authority is working its way into law
 
02:13:21.890 --> 02:13:21.900 align:start position:0%
yes that should be cleared up and yes
 
02:13:24.169 --> 02:13:24.179 align:start position:0%
with regard to the existing rules an
 
02:13:27.169 --> 02:13:27.179 align:start position:0%
expedited repeal of the
 
02:13:29.450 --> 02:13:29.460 align:start position:0%
individual board rules would certainly
 
02:13:33.169 --> 02:13:33.179 align:start position:0%
eliminate that conflict okay can can you
 
02:13:35.510 --> 02:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
arrange for that to happen the expedite
 
02:13:37.790 --> 02:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
if we approve this we also want to have
 
02:13:41.089 --> 02:13:41.099 align:start position:0%
the expedited repeal of existing rules
 
02:13:43.189 --> 02:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
that set fees I can have that happen
 
02:13:47.990 --> 02:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:49.729 --> 02:13:49.739 align:start position:0%
and that was all the comments I had on
 
02:13:52.250 --> 02:13:52.260 align:start position:0%
this proposal all right then I will move
 
02:13:53.810 --> 02:13:53.820 align:start position:0%
to approve
 
02:13:55.609 --> 02:13:55.619 align:start position:0%
this rule
 
02:13:59.750 --> 02:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
with the condition that the conflicting
 
02:13:59.760 --> 02:14:01.189 align:start position:0%
with the condition that the conflicting
rules

02:14:01.189 --> 02:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
rules
 
02:14:01.199 --> 02:14:03.010 align:start position:0%
rules
be

02:14:03.010 --> 02:14:03.020 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:14:05.629 --> 02:14:05.639 align:start position:0%
expedited repealed
 
02:14:08.709 --> 02:14:08.719 align:start position:0%
second on that okay
 
02:14:12.410 --> 02:14:12.420 align:start position:0%
any questions or comments
 
02:14:15.470 --> 02:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much I don't know
 
02:14:18.770 --> 02:14:18.780 align:start position:0%
which fees are said in other rules but
 
02:14:22.729 --> 02:14:22.739 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:25.850 --> 02:14:25.860 align:start position:0%
all right and for the last one for oplc
 
02:14:25.860 --> 02:14:26.810 align:start position:0%
all right and for the last one for oplc
today

02:14:26.810 --> 02:14:26.820 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:14:28.430 --> 02:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
um oh we ought to vote on we ought to
 
02:14:31.729 --> 02:14:31.739 align:start position:0%
vote on oh sorry uh the representative
 
02:14:31.739 --> 02:14:33.290 align:start position:0%
vote on oh sorry uh the representative
Rhoda

02:14:33.290 --> 02:14:33.300 align:start position:0%
Rhoda
 
02:14:35.810 --> 02:14:35.820 align:start position:0%
okay those in favor
 
02:14:39.410 --> 02:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
aye opposed okay thank you very much the
 
02:14:41.930 --> 02:14:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:43.850 --> 02:14:43.860 align:start position:0%
um and I won't spend too much time on
 
02:14:46.370 --> 02:14:46.380 align:start position:0%
this because just like the court
 
02:14:46.380 --> 02:14:47.629 align:start position:0%
this because just like the court
reporters

02:14:47.629 --> 02:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
reporters
 
02:14:50.089 --> 02:14:50.099 align:start position:0%
um this was a board that was turned into
 
02:14:51.589 --> 02:14:51.599 align:start position:0%
an Advisory Board the recreational
 
02:14:51.599 --> 02:14:53.209 align:start position:0%
an Advisory Board the recreational
therapist

02:14:53.209 --> 02:14:53.219 align:start position:0%
therapist
 
02:14:54.770 --> 02:14:54.780 align:start position:0%
um there was there was an interim rule
 
02:14:58.689 --> 02:14:58.699 align:start position:0%
in place uh and so this is just a
 
02:15:01.790 --> 02:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
regular rule making for those rules and
 
02:15:02.870 --> 02:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
it has
 
02:15:05.390 --> 02:15:05.400 align:start position:0%
um similar issues to the court reporters
 
02:15:08.450 --> 02:15:08.460 align:start position:0%
with regard to the fees refundable
 
02:15:11.209 --> 02:15:11.219 align:start position:0%
versus non-refundable
 
02:15:11.219 --> 02:15:12.370 align:start position:0%
versus non-refundable
um

02:15:12.370 --> 02:15:12.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:15.109 --> 02:15:15.119 align:start position:0%
additionally there were a couple
 
02:15:17.810 --> 02:15:17.820 align:start position:0%
substantive comments
 
02:15:20.030 --> 02:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
um one about the retention schedule
 
02:15:21.589 --> 02:15:21.599 align:start position:0%
which we also won't get into because
 
02:15:25.729 --> 02:15:25.739 align:start position:0%
we've had that conversation before and
 
02:15:27.589 --> 02:15:27.599 align:start position:0%
um a couple comments with regard to
 
02:15:31.370 --> 02:15:31.380 align:start position:0%
citations to the PLC 300 rules that had
 
02:15:34.069 --> 02:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
come through a month or two ago there
 
02:15:36.589 --> 02:15:36.599 align:start position:0%
were some unclear comments on those PLC
 
02:15:39.370 --> 02:15:39.380 align:start position:0%
300 rules that did not seem to be
 
02:15:42.470 --> 02:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
fixed in the adopted rules so I just
 
02:15:45.470 --> 02:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
made a comment on those to bring up the
 
02:15:48.830 --> 02:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
issues again the first being on page
 
02:15:48.840 --> 02:15:50.169 align:start position:0%
issues again the first being on page
four

02:15:50.169 --> 02:15:50.179 align:start position:0%
four
 
02:15:55.390 --> 02:15:55.400 align:start position:0%
the rule sites to PLC 304.04 C and in
 
02:15:58.370 --> 02:15:58.380 align:start position:0%
304.04 C does not make clear that that
 
02:15:59.870 --> 02:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
portion of the form is only for
 
02:16:04.010 --> 02:16:04.020 align:start position:0%
applicants for reciprocity the form does
 
02:16:05.750 --> 02:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
make it clear but the rule text itself
 
02:16:07.490 --> 02:16:07.500 align:start position:0%
does not make that clear and that was
 
02:16:11.870 --> 02:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
not fixed in the adoption
 
02:16:11.880 --> 02:16:12.950 align:start position:0%
not fixed in the adoption
um

02:16:12.950 --> 02:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:12.960 --> 02:16:15.109 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:16:15.109 --> 02:16:15.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:16:19.129 --> 02:16:19.139 align:start position:0%
they're um when do when do the
 
02:16:21.729 --> 02:16:21.739 align:start position:0%
current interim rules expire
 
02:16:24.950 --> 02:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
I believe it is also July I believe this
 
02:16:27.169 --> 02:16:27.179 align:start position:0%
these rules came about the same time
 
02:16:29.270 --> 02:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
that the court reporters did they're on
 
02:16:30.470 --> 02:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
the same track
 
02:16:30.480 --> 02:16:32.150 align:start position:0%
the same track
okay

02:16:32.150 --> 02:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:16:34.429 --> 02:16:34.439 align:start position:0%
in that case I moved to postpone them
 
02:16:36.110 --> 02:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
with the same issue as the court
 
02:16:36.120 --> 02:16:38.150 align:start position:0%
with the same issue as the court
reporters

02:16:38.150 --> 02:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
reporters
 
02:16:38.160 --> 02:16:38.990 align:start position:0%
reporters
um

02:16:38.990 --> 02:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:40.910 --> 02:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
and we hope you will address the other
 
02:16:46.009 --> 02:16:46.019 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:50.330 --> 02:16:50.340 align:start position:0%
okay Eric yes representative Leon a few
 
02:16:53.089 --> 02:16:53.099 align:start position:0%
seconds oh okay fine I thought it was a
 
02:16:58.610 --> 02:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:00.169 --> 02:17:00.179 align:start position:0%
any other
 
02:17:03.049 --> 02:17:03.059 align:start position:0%
discussion of of that uh
 
02:17:05.150 --> 02:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
of this rule
 
02:17:06.950 --> 02:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
those in favor
 
02:17:06.960 --> 02:17:07.849 align:start position:0%
those in favor
aye

02:17:07.849 --> 02:17:07.859 align:start position:0%
aye
 
02:17:10.370 --> 02:17:10.380 align:start position:0%
those opposed
 
02:17:12.709 --> 02:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
okay so we will postpone those three
 
02:17:16.610 --> 02:17:16.620 align:start position:0%
rules to clarify the fee issue and in
 
02:17:18.110 --> 02:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
this case there's also some other
 
02:17:19.969 --> 02:17:19.979 align:start position:0%
comments that you can pick up at while
 
02:17:21.709 --> 02:17:21.719 align:start position:0%
you're at it and can I get clarification
 
02:17:23.450 --> 02:17:23.460 align:start position:0%
on that issue because I believe the
 
02:17:26.209 --> 02:17:26.219 align:start position:0%
statute gives the oplc authority to set
 
02:17:28.549 --> 02:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
fees for and it specifically states
 
02:17:31.669 --> 02:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
initial applications renewals read
 
02:17:34.009 --> 02:17:34.019 align:start position:0%
statements all of all of the fee setting
 
02:17:36.169 --> 02:17:36.179 align:start position:0%
Authority and right and I I share the
 
02:17:38.150 --> 02:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
opinion of Representative Lynn that we
 
02:17:40.490 --> 02:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
might be getting a little to pedantic so
 
02:17:42.230 --> 02:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
what is the concern about the difference
 
02:17:46.730 --> 02:17:46.740 align:start position:0%
between an application and a license fee
 
02:17:48.049 --> 02:17:48.059 align:start position:0%
that you would like specifically
 
02:17:51.410 --> 02:17:51.420 align:start position:0%
addressed so that I can I think um well
 
02:17:53.570 --> 02:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
like we like we said earlier that um
 
02:17:55.849 --> 02:17:55.859 align:start position:0%
some of the statutes do differentiate
 
02:17:58.250 --> 02:17:58.260 align:start position:0%
that the license or that the fee that's
 
02:18:01.610 --> 02:18:01.620 align:start position:0%
paid only turns into an application fee
 
02:18:03.709 --> 02:18:03.719 align:start position:0%
whenever it's
 
02:18:07.190 --> 02:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
um denied and uh there are not just with
 
02:18:08.750 --> 02:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
the Foresters there are a couple of
 
02:18:11.330 --> 02:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
other place other boards that it impacts
 
02:18:13.190 --> 02:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
as well in regard to the recreational
 
02:18:17.089 --> 02:18:17.099 align:start position:0%
therapist the question is are if are the
 
02:18:19.910 --> 02:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
fees all application fees or some of it
 
02:18:22.129 --> 02:18:22.139 align:start position:0%
licensing fees and the difference is
 
02:18:24.009 --> 02:18:24.019 align:start position:0%
that if
 
02:18:27.410 --> 02:18:27.420 align:start position:0%
license fees are are potentially
 
02:18:29.990 --> 02:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
refunded and I just want to make clear
 
02:18:32.209 --> 02:18:32.219 align:start position:0%
that yes the statutes for the
 
02:18:35.089 --> 02:18:35.099 align:start position:0%
recreational therapists do give the oplc
 
02:18:39.169 --> 02:18:39.179 align:start position:0%
the authority to set the fees for this
 
02:18:39.179 --> 02:18:40.190 align:start position:0%
the authority to set the fees for this
board

02:18:40.190 --> 02:18:40.200 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:18:40.200 --> 02:18:41.089 align:start position:0%
board
um

02:18:41.089 --> 02:18:41.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:43.690 --> 02:18:43.700 align:start position:0%
but once again it's a little
 
02:18:46.669 --> 02:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
unclear what is a license versus what is
 
02:18:48.349 --> 02:18:48.359 align:start position:0%
an application fee
 
02:18:50.929 --> 02:18:50.939 align:start position:0%
we're not arguing that the fees are are
 
02:18:53.030 --> 02:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
in themselves inappropriate the question
 
02:18:56.589 --> 02:18:56.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:59.990 --> 02:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
so I I think we I definitely don't want
 
02:19:02.209 --> 02:19:02.219 align:start position:0%
to have a situation where sometimes it's
 
02:19:05.150 --> 02:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
this sometimes it's that unless it's a
 
02:19:07.370 --> 02:19:07.380 align:start position:0%
Tuesday you know this is too much
 
02:19:10.250 --> 02:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
Hopscotch I don't think we have to
 
02:19:14.089 --> 02:19:14.099 align:start position:0%
decide either there is a difference
 
02:19:17.509 --> 02:19:17.519 align:start position:0%
in some cases and not in other cases or
 
02:19:19.190 --> 02:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
whatever but we need to think this
 
02:19:21.889 --> 02:19:21.899 align:start position:0%
through much better because it's it's
 
02:19:23.150 --> 02:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
kind of like
 
02:19:25.730 --> 02:19:25.740 align:start position:0%
spider on a web they know how to do it
 
02:19:27.709 --> 02:19:27.719 align:start position:0%
we put our feet in the holes
 
02:19:30.469 --> 02:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
okay it's just like what representative
 
02:19:32.750 --> 02:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
McGuire said because one type of fee is
 
02:19:35.570 --> 02:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
refundable the other one is not so the
 
02:19:38.929 --> 02:19:38.939 align:start position:0%
public or the licensees need to know
 
02:19:41.150 --> 02:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
right so you were you talked earlier
 
02:19:43.969 --> 02:19:43.979 align:start position:0%
about cleanup and this definitely needs
 
02:19:46.310 --> 02:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
to be cleaned up right in my concern
 
02:19:47.990 --> 02:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
though is or it was my understanding
 
02:19:49.429 --> 02:19:49.439 align:start position:0%
from a legal interpretation now
 
02:19:51.230 --> 02:19:51.240 align:start position:0%
Heather's a finance individual so we
 
02:19:52.190 --> 02:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
might be coming at a different
 
02:19:55.190 --> 02:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
perspective but but my perspective was
 
02:19:57.590 --> 02:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
we put application fees and if you look
 
02:20:00.770 --> 02:20:00.780 align:start position:0%
at the 1000 twos that we did not address
 
02:20:02.950 --> 02:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
today every one of those says
 
02:20:07.010 --> 02:20:07.020 align:start position:0%
application processing so to me I our
 
02:20:08.810 --> 02:20:08.820 align:start position:0%
intent was clear these are application
 
02:20:10.790 --> 02:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
processing fees
 
02:20:16.250 --> 02:20:16.260 align:start position:0%
except that as a legislature I don't
 
02:20:19.010 --> 02:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
believe that we think that all the fees
 
02:20:21.590 --> 02:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
are application processing fees we
 
02:20:23.330 --> 02:20:23.340 align:start position:0%
believe that there is at least some
 
02:20:25.490 --> 02:20:25.500 align:start position:0%
portion of the fees that are paid that
 
02:20:29.210 --> 02:20:29.220 align:start position:0%
are a license fee and the app and
 
02:20:32.030 --> 02:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
and that we'd like you to be clearer
 
02:20:34.550 --> 02:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
about it if you decide they are all
 
02:20:37.190 --> 02:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
application fees we're going to need
 
02:20:40.250 --> 02:20:40.260 align:start position:0%
some better backup okay okay thank you
 
02:20:41.870 --> 02:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
for clarification
 
02:20:45.170 --> 02:20:45.180 align:start position:0%
we will look at that did you vote on the
 
02:20:49.849 --> 02:20:49.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:52.730 --> 02:20:52.740 align:start position:0%
I thought we did yes
 
02:20:55.190 --> 02:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
oh we did what vote on the postponement
 
02:20:59.750 --> 02:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:01.490 --> 02:21:01.500 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
02:21:03.290 --> 02:21:03.300 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:21:05.570 --> 02:21:05.580 align:start position:0%
Board of Nursing
 
02:21:09.230 --> 02:21:09.240 align:start position:0%
okay we're on the home stretch here
 
02:21:10.990 --> 02:21:11.000 align:start position:0%
um this is
 
02:21:16.070 --> 02:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
2023-69 the board has uh submitted a
 
02:21:18.290 --> 02:21:18.300 align:start position:0%
conditional approval there's just one
 
02:21:20.830 --> 02:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
comment I have on
 
02:21:25.130 --> 02:21:25.140 align:start position:0%
page two of the rule text
 
02:21:28.070 --> 02:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
because this um the the language says
 
02:21:31.010 --> 02:21:31.020 align:start position:0%
the person may be fined fifty dollars
 
02:21:33.530 --> 02:21:33.540 align:start position:0%
for every calendar month and it keeps
 
02:21:33.540 --> 02:21:34.429 align:start position:0%
for every calendar month and it keeps
going

02:21:34.429 --> 02:21:34.439 align:start position:0%
going
 
02:21:37.790 --> 02:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
um the May is the the real issue is that
 
02:21:39.830 --> 02:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
um you wouldn't know
 
02:21:43.690 --> 02:21:43.700 align:start position:0%
how much that they may be charging you
 
02:21:47.630 --> 02:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
and they may not not charge you
 
02:21:49.730 --> 02:21:49.740 align:start position:0%
um and so I've made a suggestion in the
 
02:21:52.190 --> 02:21:52.200 align:start position:0%
Box down at the bottom to change it to
 
02:21:54.770 --> 02:21:54.780 align:start position:0%
shall and kind of reword the sentence to
 
02:21:57.110 --> 02:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
make it a little clearer
 
02:21:58.910 --> 02:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
um and so that's the only change it
 
02:22:00.650 --> 02:22:00.660 align:start position:0%
really needs to be made if the
 
02:22:02.450 --> 02:22:02.460 align:start position:0%
department doesn't want to
 
02:22:04.969 --> 02:22:04.979 align:start position:0%
use my entire suggestion as long as they
 
02:22:07.250 --> 02:22:07.260 align:start position:0%
change made a shell then it should be
 
02:22:07.260 --> 02:22:08.210 align:start position:0%
change made a shell then it should be
okay

02:22:08.210 --> 02:22:08.220 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:22:08.220 --> 02:22:09.590 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

02:22:09.590 --> 02:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:22:11.809 --> 02:22:11.819 align:start position:0%
good morning Tina Kelly the office of
 
02:22:12.650 --> 02:22:12.660 align:start position:0%
professional life insurance
 
02:22:12.660 --> 02:22:14.450 align:start position:0%
professional life insurance
certification

02:22:14.450 --> 02:22:14.460 align:start position:0%
certification
 
02:22:16.070 --> 02:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
um it was my understanding that the last
 
02:22:19.130 --> 02:22:19.140 align:start position:0%
sentence clarified they maybe maybe fine
 
02:22:21.230 --> 02:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
they may be fine and the board shall
 
02:22:23.830 --> 02:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
apply the factors described in nursing
 
02:22:26.330 --> 02:22:26.340 align:start position:0%
40204g when determining the amount of
 
02:22:29.090 --> 02:22:29.100 align:start position:0%
fine so that was to clarify when that
 
02:22:29.100 --> 02:22:30.710 align:start position:0%
fine so that was to clarify when that
fine

02:22:30.710 --> 02:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
fine
 
02:22:33.290 --> 02:22:33.300 align:start position:0%
would be
 
02:22:35.750 --> 02:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
what would how the board would determine
 
02:22:37.610 --> 02:22:37.620 align:start position:0%
when that fine would be applied and how
 
02:22:41.090 --> 02:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:42.650 --> 02:22:42.660 align:start position:0%
um that actually doesn't
 
02:22:42.660 --> 02:22:43.370 align:start position:0%
um that actually doesn't
um

02:22:43.370 --> 02:22:43.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:47.330 --> 02:22:47.340 align:start position:0%
correct the problem just because they
 
02:22:47.340 --> 02:22:50.450 align:start position:0%
correct the problem just because they
um

02:22:50.450 --> 02:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:54.650 --> 02:22:54.660 align:start position:0%
like the fifty dollars is is the the max
 
02:22:56.929 --> 02:22:56.939 align:start position:0%
right and so they can they it's not
 
02:22:59.210 --> 02:22:59.220 align:start position:0%
clear that they can be fined up to fifty
 
02:22:59.220 --> 02:23:00.050 align:start position:0%
clear that they can be fined up to fifty
dollars

02:23:00.050 --> 02:23:00.060 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:23:00.060 --> 02:23:01.550 align:start position:0%
dollars
and

02:23:01.550 --> 02:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:23:01.560 --> 02:23:02.809 align:start position:0%
and
um

02:23:02.809 --> 02:23:02.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:05.510 --> 02:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
the the
 
02:23:09.530 --> 02:23:09.540 align:start position:0%
board is is giving a fine but they have
 
02:23:12.349 --> 02:23:12.359 align:start position:0%
these determinations of why it would be
 
02:23:12.359 --> 02:23:15.050 align:start position:0%
these determinations of why it would be
less

02:23:15.050 --> 02:23:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:18.650 --> 02:23:18.660 align:start position:0%
yeah if I do I understand correctly that
 
02:23:20.990 --> 02:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
the shell applies to the board
 
02:23:29.349 --> 02:23:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:33.410 --> 02:23:33.420 align:start position:0%
in reading that shall be fined no matter
 
02:23:36.230 --> 02:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
what there'd be no determination as to
 
02:23:39.950 --> 02:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
you know what the circumstances were is
 
02:23:41.809 --> 02:23:41.819 align:start position:0%
if you say shall be fine that everybody
 
02:23:44.330 --> 02:23:44.340 align:start position:0%
will be fine fifty dollars for every day
 
02:23:47.389 --> 02:23:47.399 align:start position:0%
that that goes by but then the next
 
02:23:50.450 --> 02:23:50.460 align:start position:0%
sentence gives them the it gives you the
 
02:23:52.309 --> 02:23:52.319 align:start position:0%
context in which they would determine
 
02:23:56.090 --> 02:23:56.100 align:start position:0%
how much so would adding in Shelby fined
 
02:23:59.389 --> 02:23:59.399 align:start position:0%
up to work
 
02:23:59.399 --> 02:24:00.410 align:start position:0%
up to work
okay

02:24:00.410 --> 02:24:00.420 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:24:02.990 --> 02:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm I'm confused what is the
 
02:24:04.730 --> 02:24:04.740 align:start position:0%
problem with the use of the word may why
 
02:24:06.889 --> 02:24:06.899 align:start position:0%
why shouldn't the board have discretion
 
02:24:08.150 --> 02:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
to decide whether they're going to find
 
02:24:10.429 --> 02:24:10.439 align:start position:0%
right why that I mean is there there's a
 
02:24:10.439 --> 02:24:12.309 align:start position:0%
right why that I mean is there there's a
statute

02:24:12.309 --> 02:24:12.319 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:24:14.870 --> 02:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
that's specifically prohibited in the
 
02:24:18.770 --> 02:24:18.780 align:start position:0%
manual because a in the manual May is
 
02:24:22.730 --> 02:24:22.740 align:start position:0%
used only to Grant discretion to say
 
02:24:25.670 --> 02:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
example licensee someone outside the
 
02:24:28.429 --> 02:24:28.439 align:start position:0%
department if the department wants to
 
02:24:31.730 --> 02:24:31.740 align:start position:0%
show discretion they say shall if or
 
02:24:34.429 --> 02:24:34.439 align:start position:0%
shall unless and then they give the
 
02:24:36.889 --> 02:24:36.899 align:start position:0%
criteria if the criteria could be
 
02:24:38.990 --> 02:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
extensive or it could be a couple
 
02:24:41.929 --> 02:24:41.939 align:start position:0%
example examples and some very general
 
02:24:45.590 --> 02:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
language as the overall Criterion
 
02:24:48.469 --> 02:24:48.479 align:start position:0%
because if it simply says may you don't
 
02:24:49.910 --> 02:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
know what the Department's going to do
 
02:24:53.290 --> 02:24:53.300 align:start position:0%
in uh in an uh specific insurance
 
02:24:56.030 --> 02:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
instance they could say well it's
 
02:25:00.410 --> 02:25:00.420 align:start position:0%
Tuesday so we're going to do this uh I
 
02:25:03.349 --> 02:25:03.359 align:start position:0%
mean it's Sally allows for
 
02:25:06.950 --> 02:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
if if the manual says that then my I'm
 
02:25:08.809 --> 02:25:08.819 align:start position:0%
not this is beyond today but the manual
 
02:25:10.550 --> 02:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
should be changed because that's crazy I
 
02:25:13.429 --> 02:25:13.439 align:start position:0%
mean respectfully it really is the if
 
02:25:16.790 --> 02:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
the if they decided if the if the rule
 
02:25:19.190 --> 02:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
said May and they decided that we're not
 
02:25:20.510 --> 02:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
going to apply it today because it's
 
02:25:22.790 --> 02:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
Tuesday and there was an appeal that
 
02:25:24.170 --> 02:25:24.180 align:start position:0%
would be flipped in a minute and it
 
02:25:26.570 --> 02:25:26.580 align:start position:0%
would and and fees would probably be
 
02:25:28.610 --> 02:25:28.620 align:start position:0%
assessed against the department for for
 
02:25:32.510 --> 02:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
making a crazy decision it's I mean it's
 
02:25:34.610 --> 02:25:34.620 align:start position:0%
There are rules
 
02:25:37.130 --> 02:25:37.140 align:start position:0%
that you know all over the place that
 
02:25:39.770 --> 02:25:39.780 align:start position:0%
say May and it did to give a board
 
02:25:42.530 --> 02:25:42.540 align:start position:0%
discretion I just don't understand I
 
02:25:44.750 --> 02:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
mean you know court rules are full of
 
02:25:46.849 --> 02:25:46.859 align:start position:0%
those kind of things it just it seems to
 
02:25:49.670 --> 02:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
me it's perfectly appropriate to to give
 
02:25:52.370 --> 02:25:52.380 align:start position:0%
an agency discretion to make a decision
 
02:25:54.469 --> 02:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
now it may be a problem I'm not saying
 
02:25:56.630 --> 02:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
it may not be appropriate to also put in
 
02:25:59.210 --> 02:25:59.220 align:start position:0%
some criteria on which you would use it
 
02:26:00.889 --> 02:26:00.899 align:start position:0%
on which you would exercise the
 
02:26:04.309 --> 02:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
discretion but to say to to tell a board
 
02:26:07.429 --> 02:26:07.439 align:start position:0%
that you know you have to do something
 
02:26:09.410 --> 02:26:09.420 align:start position:0%
that seems like I just don't understand
 
02:26:13.130 --> 02:26:13.140 align:start position:0%
that well the the statute I believe and
 
02:26:16.250 --> 02:26:16.260 align:start position:0%
the manual both give ways to
 
02:26:19.490 --> 02:26:19.500 align:start position:0%
have discretion so we can you know the
 
02:26:21.710 --> 02:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
the boards the agencies the
 
02:26:23.750 --> 02:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
Commissioners they can they all can have
 
02:26:23.760 --> 02:26:25.429 align:start position:0%
Commissioners they can they all can have
discretion

02:26:25.429 --> 02:26:25.439 align:start position:0%
discretion
 
02:26:27.590 --> 02:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
um they just do need to put in criteria
 
02:26:30.110 --> 02:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
so that the people that are reading the
 
02:26:33.190 --> 02:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
rules understand what is going to happen
 
02:26:37.130 --> 02:26:37.140 align:start position:0%
and so it's it's not that we're not
 
02:26:39.770 --> 02:26:39.780 align:start position:0%
wanting them to have any discretion we
 
02:26:43.010 --> 02:26:43.020 align:start position:0%
just it it needs to be clear to the rule
 
02:26:51.309 --> 02:26:51.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:54.110 --> 02:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
I guess I it seems to me that just was
 
02:26:56.469 --> 02:26:56.479 align:start position:0%
really sort of overthinking it but
 
02:27:00.110 --> 02:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
even with criteria if it says the agency
 
02:27:05.809 --> 02:27:05.819 align:start position:0%
May impose this fine if one two or three
 
02:27:08.870 --> 02:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
it's still okay maybe one two or three
 
02:27:11.630 --> 02:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
exists uh so they've committed a
 
02:27:13.969 --> 02:27:13.979 align:start position:0%
violation but the word may means the
 
02:27:15.830 --> 02:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
department can disregard the fact that
 
02:27:17.330 --> 02:27:17.340 align:start position:0%
there is a violation which is exactly
 
02:27:18.950 --> 02:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
what they should be able to do I mean
 
02:27:21.230 --> 02:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
it's that that's the
 
02:27:25.630 --> 02:27:25.640 align:start position:0%
that just seems to me that you that
 
02:27:29.030 --> 02:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's what discretion is all about I
 
02:27:31.250 --> 02:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
mean if they again obviously if they
 
02:27:33.770 --> 02:27:33.780 align:start position:0%
abuse their discretion if they if they
 
02:27:35.870 --> 02:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
do something like saying you know we're
 
02:27:37.550 --> 02:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
not opposing the fine because it you
 
02:27:40.730 --> 02:27:40.740 align:start position:0%
today's Tuesday obviously they could
 
02:27:42.349 --> 02:27:42.359 align:start position:0%
that could be reverse or if they said
 
02:27:43.790 --> 02:27:43.800 align:start position:0%
we're not imposing the fine because
 
02:27:46.730 --> 02:27:46.740 align:start position:0%
you're an African-American or or you are
 
02:27:48.410 --> 02:27:48.420 align:start position:0%
or you're not an African-American or
 
02:27:51.290 --> 02:27:51.300 align:start position:0%
some obviously discriminatory basis I
 
02:27:53.750 --> 02:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
think that would get flipped right then
 
02:27:56.090 --> 02:27:56.100 align:start position:0%
I think we're going off on a tangent on
 
02:27:59.990 --> 02:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
this case the the the I if you wish to
 
02:28:02.450 --> 02:28:02.460 align:start position:0%
take up the issue please
 
02:28:05.570 --> 02:28:05.580 align:start position:0%
um yeah but it but the right now the
 
02:28:07.969 --> 02:28:07.979 align:start position:0%
manual does say that it should it should
 
02:28:09.410 --> 02:28:09.420 align:start position:0%
be shall
 
02:28:09.420 --> 02:28:11.330 align:start position:0%
be shall
and

02:28:11.330 --> 02:28:11.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:28:11.340 --> 02:28:12.889 align:start position:0%
and
um

02:28:12.889 --> 02:28:12.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:16.250 --> 02:28:16.260 align:start position:0%
in this case where the
 
02:28:19.750 --> 02:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
um that there are specifically
 
02:28:23.150 --> 02:28:23.160 align:start position:0%
criteria for to determine the amount of
 
02:28:24.290 --> 02:28:24.300 align:start position:0%
the fine
 
02:28:27.469 --> 02:28:27.479 align:start position:0%
that you know up to fifty dollars would
 
02:28:29.030 --> 02:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
make sense to me
 
02:28:31.429 --> 02:28:31.439 align:start position:0%
although I do would prefer to say that
 
02:28:34.670 --> 02:28:34.680 align:start position:0%
they shall be fined because that implies
 
02:28:38.030 --> 02:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
that the board will evaluate the fine
 
02:28:40.610 --> 02:28:40.620 align:start position:0%
not it may they may come up and say
 
02:28:44.090 --> 02:28:44.100 align:start position:0%
shall be fined zero but they should the
 
02:28:45.950 --> 02:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
board should be looking at what the fine
 
02:28:47.330 --> 02:28:47.340 align:start position:0%
should be
 
02:28:50.510 --> 02:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:53.570 --> 02:28:53.580 align:start position:0%
so does the department agree with um
 
02:28:55.910 --> 02:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
changing the language language to shall
 
02:29:02.090 --> 02:29:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:04.750 --> 02:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
so my question would be
 
02:29:08.210 --> 02:29:08.220 align:start position:0%
if the board after putting in the
 
02:29:12.309 --> 02:29:12.319 align:start position:0%
criteria described in Nur 40204 G
 
02:29:14.450 --> 02:29:14.460 align:start position:0%
determines that a fine would be
 
02:29:14.460 --> 02:29:17.030 align:start position:0%
determines that a fine would be
inappropriate

02:29:17.030 --> 02:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
inappropriate
 
02:29:19.790 --> 02:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
yes that would work yes even if it shall
 
02:29:23.630 --> 02:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
be up to it could be zero yes okay then
 
02:29:30.349 --> 02:29:30.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:35.630 --> 02:29:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:37.969 --> 02:29:37.979 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none
 
02:29:41.870 --> 02:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
on movie conditionally approve
 
02:29:44.570 --> 02:29:44.580 align:start position:0%

02:29:44.580 --> 02:29:45.770 align:start position:0%

02:29:45.770 --> 02:29:45.780 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
02:29:48.469 --> 02:29:48.479 align:start position:0%
assembly Shanley I'm sorry
 
02:29:54.610 --> 02:29:54.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:58.070 --> 02:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
and all right any uh
 
02:30:02.570 --> 02:30:02.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:04.550 --> 02:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
those in favor
 
02:30:06.590 --> 02:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
aye opposed no
 
02:30:09.050 --> 02:30:09.060 align:start position:0%
all right representative the record
 
02:30:11.210 --> 02:30:11.220 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn votes now thank you
 
02:30:15.290 --> 02:30:15.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:15.300 --> 02:30:16.790 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:30:16.790 --> 02:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:30:20.750 --> 02:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
so 2023 89 is the Department of Health
 
02:30:23.150 --> 02:30:23.160 align:start position:0%
and Human Services the rules on Foster
 
02:30:26.230 --> 02:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
family care licensing requirements
 
02:30:29.270 --> 02:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
the department did file a timely
 
02:30:31.190 --> 02:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request but I
 
02:30:32.929 --> 02:30:32.939 align:start position:0%
apologize it was not reviewed and put on
 
02:30:35.090 --> 02:30:35.100 align:start position:0%
the website till yesterday
 
02:30:36.889 --> 02:30:36.899 align:start position:0%
um it unfortunately
 
02:30:38.510 --> 02:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
there was a bit of a miscommunication
 
02:30:41.690 --> 02:30:41.700 align:start position:0%
and it was not um addressed as quickly
 
02:30:44.630 --> 02:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
before this meeting but it is online now
 
02:30:46.429 --> 02:30:46.439 align:start position:0%
and the conditional approval does
 
02:30:48.710 --> 02:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
address all of the substantive comments
 
02:30:52.190 --> 02:30:52.200 align:start position:0%
except for one which is a unclear
 
02:30:55.490 --> 02:30:55.500 align:start position:0%
legislative intent comment on page five
 
02:30:59.270 --> 02:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
of the rule text and
 
02:30:59.280 --> 02:31:01.250 align:start position:0%
of the rule text and
this

02:31:01.250 --> 02:31:01.260 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:31:06.610 --> 02:31:06.620 align:start position:0%
has to do with 541 a 29 which requires
 
02:31:09.290 --> 02:31:09.300 align:start position:0%
within a reasonable time not exceed 60
 
02:31:11.270 --> 02:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
days after the receipt of an application
 
02:31:14.270 --> 02:31:14.280 align:start position:0%
petition or request or response to a
 
02:31:16.790 --> 02:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
timely request made by the agency uh the
 
02:31:19.790 --> 02:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
agency shall approve or deny or commence
 
02:31:23.929 --> 02:31:23.939 align:start position:0%
an adjudicative proceeding however the
 
02:31:26.650 --> 02:31:26.660 align:start position:0%
requirements in this rule for
 
02:31:29.170 --> 02:31:29.180 align:start position:0%
licensing a foster care placement
 
02:31:32.530 --> 02:31:32.540 align:start position:0%
includes a lot of
 
02:31:35.210 --> 02:31:35.220 align:start position:0%
additional information it requires
 
02:31:37.370 --> 02:31:37.380 align:start position:0%
background checks it requires an
 
02:31:39.170 --> 02:31:39.180 align:start position:0%
inspection of the property by the fire
 
02:31:42.110 --> 02:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
marshal by the building inspector so all
 
02:31:44.030 --> 02:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
of this additional information could
 
02:31:47.450 --> 02:31:47.460 align:start position:0%
exceed that 60-day statutory timeline
 
02:31:49.610 --> 02:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
however this is all information that is
 
02:31:51.830 --> 02:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
clearly important to this particular
 
02:31:54.889 --> 02:31:54.899 align:start position:0%
licensing procedure so this comment was
 
02:31:59.210 --> 02:31:59.220 align:start position:0%
made back in 2020 when this rule came
 
02:32:02.690 --> 02:32:02.700 align:start position:0%
uh through the committee and it was
 
02:32:04.730 --> 02:32:04.740 align:start position:0%
approved as written but I just wanted to
 
02:32:06.170 --> 02:32:06.180 align:start position:0%
bring that to your attention again this
 
02:32:10.070 --> 02:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:11.570 --> 02:32:11.580 align:start position:0%
good morning Allison radmay
 
02:32:12.950 --> 02:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
administrator for the administrative
 
02:32:14.090 --> 02:32:14.100 align:start position:0%
rules unit at the Department of Health
 
02:32:15.590 --> 02:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
and Human Services
 
02:32:15.600 --> 02:32:17.170 align:start position:0%
and Human Services
foreign

02:32:17.170 --> 02:32:17.180 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
02:32:19.790 --> 02:32:19.800 align:start position:0%
Jenna Wilson of the division for
 
02:32:20.990 --> 02:32:21.000 align:start position:0%

and finally Beth margison chief of legal
 
02:32:27.650 --> 02:32:27.660 align:start position:0%
Regulatory and legislative affairs uh
 
02:32:29.510 --> 02:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
for the division and I oversee the
 
02:32:31.790 --> 02:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
policy unit
 
02:32:31.800 --> 02:32:35.809 align:start position:0%
policy unit
questions

02:32:35.809 --> 02:32:35.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:39.110 --> 02:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
um would it be reasonable to to say
 
02:32:41.750 --> 02:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
something like the 60-day period applies
 
02:32:43.910 --> 02:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
after all pertinent information is
 
02:32:46.550 --> 02:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
available or the application is complete
 
02:32:49.790 --> 02:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
because I believe that's an exception in
 
02:32:52.190 --> 02:32:52.200 align:start position:0%
that in that schedule
 
02:32:54.530 --> 02:32:54.540 align:start position:0%
it could certainly be phrased that way
 
02:32:56.510 --> 02:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
because the statute does say or the
 
02:32:59.090 --> 02:32:59.100 align:start position:0%
response to a timely request made by the
 
02:33:01.370 --> 02:33:01.380 align:start position:0%
agency and so those additional
 
02:33:04.849 --> 02:33:04.859 align:start position:0%
documentation could be
 
02:33:07.190 --> 02:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
could be construed as that additional
 
02:33:09.469 --> 02:33:09.479 align:start position:0%
request for information so just
 
02:33:11.570 --> 02:33:11.580 align:start position:0%
clarifying in the role that the decision
 
02:33:13.370 --> 02:33:13.380 align:start position:0%
will be made within six days after that
 
02:33:16.429 --> 02:33:16.439 align:start position:0%
I think because I I agree that you don't
 
02:33:20.150 --> 02:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
want to it hand out a license because
 
02:33:22.190 --> 02:33:22.200 align:start position:0%
the fire marshal hasn't been able to be
 
02:33:25.429 --> 02:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
there in 60 days but
 
02:33:25.439 --> 02:33:26.950 align:start position:0%
there in 60 days but
um

02:33:26.950 --> 02:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:47.990 --> 02:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:50.270 --> 02:33:50.280 align:start position:0%
you might say something yeah
 
02:33:52.610 --> 02:33:52.620 align:start position:0%
I have never sat before this committee
 
02:33:55.250 --> 02:33:55.260 align:start position:0%
before so good morning
 
02:33:56.750 --> 02:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:33:59.330 --> 02:33:59.340 align:start position:0%
we have what we call an application for
 
02:34:01.070 --> 02:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
foster family care which is just a very
 
02:34:03.590 --> 02:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
very initial piece of paperwork that
 
02:34:05.990 --> 02:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
comes into our agency and then there are
 
02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:06.950 align:start position:0%
comes into our agency and then there are
all

02:34:06.950 --> 02:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
all
 
02:34:09.230 --> 02:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
um like five supplemental forms which
 
02:34:10.790 --> 02:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
include the the fire department
 
02:34:10.800 --> 02:34:12.770 align:start position:0%
include the the fire department
inspection

02:34:12.770 --> 02:34:12.780 align:start position:0%
inspection
 
02:34:14.090 --> 02:34:14.100 align:start position:0%
um the release of criminal records and
 
02:34:16.070 --> 02:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
all those documents and it actually
 
02:34:17.929 --> 02:34:17.939 align:start position:0%
states in the rule
 
02:34:17.939 --> 02:34:19.210 align:start position:0%
states in the rule
um

02:34:19.210 --> 02:34:19.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:19.220 --> 02:34:20.870 align:start position:0%
um
hec6446

02:34:20.870 --> 02:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
hec6446
 
02:34:24.410 --> 02:34:24.420 align:start position:0%
.06 D3 that we don't consider it a
 
02:34:26.570 --> 02:34:26.580 align:start position:0%
complete application until we receive
 
02:34:29.270 --> 02:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
actually all five lice references back
 
02:34:31.370 --> 02:34:31.380 align:start position:0%
for the applicant
 
02:34:34.070 --> 02:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
so once we have all of those things it
 
02:34:36.410 --> 02:34:36.420 align:start position:0%
becomes a complete application
 
02:34:38.270 --> 02:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
so that is
 
02:34:42.490 --> 02:34:42.500 align:start position:0%
where is that specifically stated
 
02:34:46.200 --> 02:34:46.210 align:start position:0%
6446.06 D3 okay
 
02:34:46.210 --> 02:34:51.290 align:start position:0%
6446.06 D3 okay
[Music]

02:34:51.290 --> 02:34:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:59.090 --> 02:34:59.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:01.790 --> 02:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
um Appleton shall be complete on the
 
02:35:03.410 --> 02:35:03.420 align:start position:0%
whole uh
 
02:35:05.870 --> 02:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
on all of those things so on average
 
02:35:09.590 --> 02:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
it's taking our applicants about 40 41
 
02:35:12.889 --> 02:35:12.899 align:start position:0%
days to do that process from the initial
 
02:35:16.130 --> 02:35:16.140 align:start position:0%
form 1725 which is just that very uh
 
02:35:18.889 --> 02:35:18.899 align:start position:0%
letter of interest for application
 
02:35:21.170 --> 02:35:21.180 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:35:24.349 --> 02:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
from the time that we have everything up
 
02:35:26.690 --> 02:35:26.700 align:start position:0%
in including the the five references our
 
02:35:28.790 --> 02:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
processing time on our side to say yep
 
02:35:30.889 --> 02:35:30.899 align:start position:0%
your application's complete please go do
 
02:35:32.570 --> 02:35:32.580 align:start position:0%
that home study where they have somebody
 
02:35:34.070 --> 02:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
come in and do an evaluation of their
 
02:35:36.710 --> 02:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
home that's uh one to two days in our
 
02:35:39.349 --> 02:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
office so we're looking at about 40-ish
 
02:35:42.050 --> 02:35:42.060 align:start position:0%
days to do all of the initial paperwork
 
02:35:44.630 --> 02:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
we process it and get them assigned to a
 
02:35:46.429 --> 02:35:46.439 align:start position:0%
home study uh within a couple of days
 
02:35:49.490 --> 02:35:49.500 align:start position:0%
and then it's not in our control anymore
 
02:35:51.770 --> 02:35:51.780 align:start position:0%
so I if I understand you correctly
 
02:35:54.110 --> 02:35:54.120 align:start position:0%
you're saying that the statutory
 
02:35:55.790 --> 02:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
requirement of issuing the license
 
02:35:57.710 --> 02:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
within 60 days
 
02:36:00.349 --> 02:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
is not a problem
 
02:36:03.070 --> 02:36:03.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying that
 
02:36:06.889 --> 02:36:06.899 align:start position:0%
well so the home study
 
02:36:09.590 --> 02:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
um requires uh sometimes a consultant or
 
02:36:13.250 --> 02:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
uh I sometimes I think a a staff member
 
02:36:17.450 --> 02:36:17.460 align:start position:0%
to go to a home and do quite a long list
 
02:36:19.490 --> 02:36:19.500 align:start position:0%
of things I'm not familiar completely
 
02:36:21.590 --> 02:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
with what the home study entails but
 
02:36:23.090 --> 02:36:23.100 align:start position:0%
based on the data that I ran for the
 
02:36:26.570 --> 02:36:26.580 align:start position:0%
past 12 months it's taking
 
02:36:29.030 --> 02:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
I want to say like uh right around 100
 
02:36:32.630 --> 02:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
days for because the what what's
 
02:36:34.910 --> 02:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
required often you know there needs to
 
02:36:37.010 --> 02:36:37.020 align:start position:0%
be an appointment for this consultant to
 
02:36:39.110 --> 02:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
come to the applicants home maybe things
 
02:36:40.969 --> 02:36:40.979 align:start position:0%
need to be fixed
 
02:36:43.130 --> 02:36:43.140 align:start position:0%
um so the applicant may change those
 
02:36:45.530 --> 02:36:45.540 align:start position:0%
things like they need to have GFI
 
02:36:47.330 --> 02:36:47.340 align:start position:0%
outlets in their kitchen they have to
 
02:36:50.450 --> 02:36:50.460 align:start position:0%
beat certain requirements to have their
 
02:36:53.210 --> 02:36:53.220 align:start position:0%
uh fire exits if it's a if the basement
 
02:36:55.910 --> 02:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
is a sleeping area there's various
 
02:36:57.469 --> 02:36:57.479 align:start position:0%
things that may need to be corrected and
 
02:36:59.750 --> 02:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
it could be a back and forth process and
 
02:37:01.969 --> 02:37:01.979 align:start position:0%
it also relies on the applicant being
 
02:37:01.979 --> 02:37:03.530 align:start position:0%
it also relies on the applicant being
responsive

02:37:03.530 --> 02:37:03.540 align:start position:0%
responsive
 
02:37:05.330 --> 02:37:05.340 align:start position:0%
and those aren't things that we have any
 
02:37:07.490 --> 02:37:07.500 align:start position:0%
control over once that home study is
 
02:37:09.710 --> 02:37:09.720 align:start position:0%
complete and we receive it back
 
02:37:12.469 --> 02:37:12.479 align:start position:0%
then we issue the license but it's that
 
02:37:14.030 --> 02:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
interim period between the time that
 
02:37:15.889 --> 02:37:15.899 align:start position:0%
we're processing the application we say
 
02:37:18.410 --> 02:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
yes you may have a home study they do
 
02:37:20.150 --> 02:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
that work and the students we get it
 
02:37:20.160 --> 02:37:21.110 align:start position:0%
that work and the students we get it
back

02:37:21.110 --> 02:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
back
 
02:37:22.969 --> 02:37:22.979 align:start position:0%
and the home studies approved then we
 
02:37:25.250 --> 02:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
can issue the license
 
02:37:27.830 --> 02:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
if I can add that that process is taking
 
02:37:30.110 --> 02:37:30.120 align:start position:0%
um according to the data that Jenna
 
02:37:32.929 --> 02:37:32.939 align:start position:0%
crunched about 100 days
 
02:37:32.939 --> 02:37:33.770 align:start position:0%
crunched about 100 days
um

02:37:33.770 --> 02:37:33.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:37:35.990 --> 02:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
pardon me can I ask clarification on
 
02:37:39.650 --> 02:37:39.660 align:start position:0%
that is it a follow-up thank you is it a
 
02:37:41.750 --> 02:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
hundred days from the time
 
02:37:44.030 --> 02:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
100 days for the home inspection and the
 
02:37:46.250 --> 02:37:46.260 align:start position:0%
repair or 100 days from the time they
 
02:37:48.230 --> 02:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
send in their first application to the
 
02:37:50.510 --> 02:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
time until all everything's done
 
02:37:53.030 --> 02:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
it's 100 days from the date we say you
 
02:37:54.530 --> 02:37:54.540 align:start position:0%
have a complete application we're
 
02:37:56.570 --> 02:37:56.580 align:start position:0%
assigning you a home study so that's
 
02:37:58.250 --> 02:37:58.260 align:start position:0%
when the 100 days or approximately
 
02:38:00.410 --> 02:38:00.420 align:start position:0%
that's what it's taking is 100 days to
 
02:38:02.090 --> 02:38:02.100 align:start position:0%
start to them when we say yes your
 
02:38:03.830 --> 02:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
application is complete you are a
 
02:38:07.730 --> 02:38:07.740 align:start position:0%
candidate for foster family now go do
 
02:38:09.110 --> 02:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
this thing
 
02:38:11.870 --> 02:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
that is with not within our control and
 
02:38:13.670 --> 02:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
when we get it back that it's approved
 
02:38:18.230 --> 02:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:20.450 --> 02:38:20.460 align:start position:0%
and I just want to make sure that I'm
 
02:38:22.429 --> 02:38:22.439 align:start position:0%
clear so it sounds like the home study
 
02:38:25.309 --> 02:38:25.319 align:start position:0%
is that also included in six four four
 
02:38:28.550 --> 02:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
six point one five or is that in a
 
02:38:39.469 --> 02:38:39.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:42.110 --> 02:38:42.120 align:start position:0%
I see director Morrow did you say some
 
02:38:44.750 --> 02:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
or is there some comment yes
 
02:38:47.389 --> 02:38:47.399 align:start position:0%
um a few years ago the
 
02:38:50.929 --> 02:38:50.939 align:start position:0%
time period under 541a in which you have
 
02:38:53.510 --> 02:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
to act on an application was reduced
 
02:38:55.429 --> 02:38:55.439 align:start position:0%
because the legislature was concerned
 
02:38:57.530 --> 02:38:57.540 align:start position:0%
that there were too many people applying
 
02:39:00.170 --> 02:39:00.180 align:start position:0%
for licenses who were waiting months and
 
02:39:02.929 --> 02:39:02.939 align:start position:0%
months to have action taken so the
 
02:39:05.570 --> 02:39:05.580 align:start position:0%
period was shortened but gel car in the
 
02:39:08.270 --> 02:39:08.280 align:start position:0%
past has realized that's not one size
 
02:39:12.230 --> 02:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
fits all uh situation so the committee
 
02:39:14.090 --> 02:39:14.100 align:start position:0%
has used its statutory discretion
 
02:39:17.210 --> 02:39:17.220 align:start position:0%
because you're not required to object to
 
02:39:20.230 --> 02:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
even if there's a black and white
 
02:39:23.090 --> 02:39:23.100 align:start position:0%
basis for objection
 
02:39:25.070 --> 02:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman thank you for
 
02:39:27.290 --> 02:39:27.300 align:start position:0%
that clarification and um if this
 
02:39:28.910 --> 02:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
hundred days is after the complete
 
02:39:30.650 --> 02:39:30.660 align:start position:0%
application do you know about how long
 
02:39:32.270 --> 02:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
it takes from somebody beginning the
 
02:39:34.429 --> 02:39:34.439 align:start position:0%
process to being a certified Foster
 
02:39:36.349 --> 02:39:36.359 align:start position:0%
family I do have that data just give me
 
02:39:38.510 --> 02:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
one moment um
 
02:39:41.389 --> 02:39:41.399 align:start position:0%
so from the moment I'm sorry are you
 
02:39:42.469 --> 02:39:42.479 align:start position:0%
talking about the moment that we have
 
02:39:44.929 --> 02:39:44.939 align:start position:0%
the initial application packet that's
 
02:39:46.849 --> 02:39:46.859 align:start position:0%
typically taking them about 40 days to
 
02:39:50.330 --> 02:39:50.340 align:start position:0%
get processed with us from saying hi I'd
 
02:39:52.130 --> 02:39:52.140 align:start position:0%
like to be a foster family I'm going to
 
02:39:53.870 --> 02:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
start this process of filling out these
 
02:39:56.990 --> 02:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
forms so we don't maintain data on the
 
02:39:59.210 --> 02:39:59.220 align:start position:0%
we get several emails phone calls
 
02:40:01.969 --> 02:40:01.979 align:start position:0%
contacts that say I'm interested we
 
02:40:03.950 --> 02:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
don't begin that clock until we receive
 
02:40:06.889 --> 02:40:06.899 align:start position:0%
the form 1725. so that's when I can give
 
02:40:09.889 --> 02:40:09.899 align:start position:0%
you data it begins then and it's 161
 
02:40:12.830 --> 02:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
days average over the past 12 calendar
 
02:40:12.840 --> 02:40:14.929 align:start position:0%
days average over the past 12 calendar
months

02:40:14.929 --> 02:40:14.939 align:start position:0%
months
 
02:40:17.150 --> 02:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
but what I can tell you is there are
 
02:40:20.030 --> 02:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
some who they send in all of their
 
02:40:21.950 --> 02:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
initial paperwork and they're done in
 
02:40:23.870 --> 02:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
less than a week we get them their home
 
02:40:25.969 --> 02:40:25.979 align:start position:0%
study within a couple of days
 
02:40:27.830 --> 02:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
they're good to go their their house has
 
02:40:29.389 --> 02:40:29.399 align:start position:0%
no issues there's nothing to do they get
 
02:40:31.370 --> 02:40:31.380 align:start position:0%
their consultant right in and there are
 
02:40:33.830 --> 02:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
folks who are who are licensed within 30
 
02:40:33.840 --> 02:40:34.670 align:start position:0%
folks who are who are licensed within 30
days

02:40:34.670 --> 02:40:34.680 align:start position:0%
days
 
02:40:36.830 --> 02:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
it just it's a matter of how informed
 
02:40:38.510 --> 02:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
they are of the process if they've got
 
02:40:40.570 --> 02:40:40.580 align:start position:0%
sort of all their ducks in a row
 
02:40:46.510 --> 02:40:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:49.190 --> 02:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
so when you go in to do a home
 
02:40:51.950 --> 02:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
inspection are you looking for more than
 
02:40:54.590 --> 02:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
a building inspector would look for as
 
02:40:57.849 --> 02:40:57.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:01.730 --> 02:41:01.740 align:start position:0%
I I don't know uh Senator Ward thank you
 
02:41:03.050 --> 02:41:03.060 align:start position:0%
for the question uh because I'm not
 
02:41:04.370 --> 02:41:04.380 align:start position:0%
really sure what a building inspector
 
02:41:05.750 --> 02:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
does when they do like a certificate of
 
02:41:08.150 --> 02:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
occupancy I just know what we're looking
 
02:41:10.370 --> 02:41:10.380 align:start position:0%
for in terms of Life Safety
 
02:41:15.349 --> 02:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:15.359 --> 02:41:16.550 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:41:16.550 --> 02:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:41:18.950 --> 02:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
I do think the fire the building is
 
02:41:20.510 --> 02:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
expected will look for all kinds of
 
02:41:23.090 --> 02:41:23.100 align:start position:0%
safety things including fire and
 
02:41:24.950 --> 02:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
electrical outlets and those kinds of
 
02:41:24.960 --> 02:41:25.750 align:start position:0%
electrical outlets and those kinds of
things

02:41:25.750 --> 02:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:41:28.429 --> 02:41:28.439 align:start position:0%
Senator Ward the issue is that in many
 
02:41:30.830 --> 02:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
parts of the state there is no building
 
02:41:30.840 --> 02:41:32.150 align:start position:0%
parts of the state there is no building
inspector

02:41:32.150 --> 02:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
inspector
 
02:41:35.090 --> 02:41:35.100 align:start position:0%
and therefore what you don't have a
 
02:41:37.190 --> 02:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
previous certification that it was there
 
02:41:39.590 --> 02:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
and then the building codes have changed
 
02:41:41.510 --> 02:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
over time so that if you have an older
 
02:41:43.910 --> 02:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
house it's very possible it might not
 
02:41:46.730 --> 02:41:46.740 align:start position:0%
meet today's Life Safety report okay
 
02:41:51.230 --> 02:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:54.290 --> 02:41:54.300 align:start position:0%
all right I have a question for the yes
 
02:41:56.929 --> 02:41:56.939 align:start position:0%
group so are we
 
02:41:59.870 --> 02:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
is there a super concern that 60 days is
 
02:42:01.790 --> 02:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
too short of a period because of all the
 
02:42:03.950 --> 02:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
things that have to happen half not not
 
02:42:06.230 --> 02:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
the pros not the application process
 
02:42:09.530 --> 02:42:09.540 align:start position:0%
itself but it's what happens after
 
02:42:12.469 --> 02:42:12.479 align:start position:0%
it's doing the home inspection and the
 
02:42:15.170 --> 02:42:15.180 align:start position:0%
home repairs that have to be done right
 
02:42:17.870 --> 02:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
and which which are difficult to
 
02:42:21.050 --> 02:42:21.060 align:start position:0%
parse out so I'm wondering if there's a
 
02:42:23.330 --> 02:42:23.340 align:start position:0%
way of clarifying that the 60 days apply
 
02:42:25.849 --> 02:42:25.859 align:start position:0%
strictly to
 
02:42:29.210 --> 02:42:29.220 align:start position:0%
the point is that the 60 days is for the
 
02:42:32.150 --> 02:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
agency to process everything they need
 
02:42:34.370 --> 02:42:34.380 align:start position:0%
to correct and it doesn't sound like
 
02:42:38.750 --> 02:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
it's an issue in this case correct so as
 
02:42:40.730 --> 02:42:40.740 align:start position:0%
long as that's clarified
 
02:42:43.910 --> 02:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
does that take care of the rule
 
02:42:48.710 --> 02:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
or the statue well so just including in
 
02:42:53.030 --> 02:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
the rule itself that the application
 
02:42:56.210 --> 02:42:56.220 align:start position:0%
because once as representative McGuire
 
02:42:58.670 --> 02:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
said it's the agency acting within 60
 
02:43:01.070 --> 02:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
days not so much as the applicant
 
02:43:04.309 --> 02:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
providing the information in 60 days so
 
02:43:06.889 --> 02:43:06.899 align:start position:0%
even including in the rule that the
 
02:43:10.190 --> 02:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
agency you know shall act within 60 days
 
02:43:11.690 --> 02:43:11.700 align:start position:0%
of receiving
 
02:43:15.170 --> 02:43:15.180 align:start position:0%
all of the information
 
02:43:15.180 --> 02:43:16.250 align:start position:0%
all of the information
um

02:43:16.250 --> 02:43:16.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:18.889 --> 02:43:18.899 align:start position:0%
maybe defining what that information is
 
02:43:21.950 --> 02:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
is it all the paperwork is it you know
 
02:43:23.929 --> 02:43:23.939 align:start position:0%
the completion of the home study and
 
02:43:25.610 --> 02:43:25.620 align:start position:0%
clarifying that way I don't think
 
02:43:27.650 --> 02:43:27.660 align:start position:0%
legally it would
 
02:43:30.110 --> 02:43:30.120 align:start position:0%
fix it as director Morrill said the
 
02:43:31.969 --> 02:43:31.979 align:start position:0%
committee can use its discretion to
 
02:43:33.590 --> 02:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
essentially say that they don't have to
 
02:43:35.570 --> 02:43:35.580 align:start position:0%
comply with the 60 days in these rules
 
02:43:38.210 --> 02:43:38.220 align:start position:0%
because of these specific circumstances
 
02:43:40.730 --> 02:43:40.740 align:start position:0%
but it might not hurt having in the
 
02:43:43.130 --> 02:43:43.140 align:start position:0%
rules that you know
 
02:43:45.770 --> 02:43:45.780 align:start position:0%
a completed application is considered
 
02:43:48.110 --> 02:43:48.120 align:start position:0%
all the information including the home
 
02:43:50.690 --> 02:43:50.700 align:start position:0%
study and then the agency will then act
 
02:43:53.389 --> 02:43:53.399 align:start position:0%
upon it within 60 days potentially could
 
02:43:56.450 --> 02:43:56.460 align:start position:0%
be something that could help I would
 
02:43:58.070 --> 02:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
feel that that that's an appropriate
 
02:44:01.910 --> 02:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
thing to add that the agency will act
 
02:44:05.330 --> 02:44:05.340 align:start position:0%
within 60 days of receipt of the Home
 
02:44:05.340 --> 02:44:06.849 align:start position:0%
within 60 days of receipt of the Home
Inspection

02:44:06.849 --> 02:44:06.859 align:start position:0%
Inspection
 
02:44:09.650 --> 02:44:09.660 align:start position:0%
clearance essentially that that there
 
02:44:11.270 --> 02:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
are no issues left yeah because that's
 
02:44:13.130 --> 02:44:13.140 align:start position:0%
that's why I asked the agency where in
 
02:44:15.950 --> 02:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
the rules the home study was because the
 
02:44:18.710 --> 02:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
section that was cited about what is a
 
02:44:20.450 --> 02:44:20.460 align:start position:0%
completed application I wasn't quite
 
02:44:22.730 --> 02:44:22.740 align:start position:0%
seeing the home study included in there
 
02:44:24.590 --> 02:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
and I just wanted to make sure I wasn't
 
02:44:27.230 --> 02:44:27.240 align:start position:0%
missing it either yeah so I think it
 
02:44:29.150 --> 02:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
needs to be reiterated that the home
 
02:44:31.969 --> 02:44:31.979 align:start position:0%
study is also included in being a
 
02:44:40.790 --> 02:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:40.800 --> 02:44:44.330 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:44:44.330 --> 02:44:44.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:46.490 --> 02:44:46.500 align:start position:0%
I don't see where they do the home study
 
02:44:46.500 --> 02:45:00.550 align:start position:0%
I don't see where they do the home study
either

02:45:00.550 --> 02:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:02.570 --> 02:45:02.580 align:start position:0%
I apologize we're looking for the
 
02:45:04.370 --> 02:45:04.380 align:start position:0%
appropriate spot to
 
02:45:04.380 --> 02:45:11.389 align:start position:0%
appropriate spot to
the right thing okay

02:45:11.389 --> 02:45:11.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:11.399 --> 02:45:14.389 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:45:14.389 --> 02:45:14.399 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:45:14.399 --> 02:45:15.590 align:start position:0%
yes
yes

02:45:15.590 --> 02:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:45:17.210 --> 02:45:17.220 align:start position:0%
um I guess what I will say at this point
 
02:45:20.090 --> 02:45:20.100 align:start position:0%
is it does seem to me reasonable
 
02:45:24.410 --> 02:45:24.420 align:start position:0%
um under that there are requirements in
 
02:45:26.450 --> 02:45:26.460 align:start position:0%
place that are
 
02:45:26.460 --> 02:45:27.469 align:start position:0%
place that are
um

02:45:27.469 --> 02:45:27.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:30.110 --> 02:45:30.120 align:start position:0%
dependent on the actions of the
 
02:45:33.110 --> 02:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
applicant that the department clearly
 
02:45:35.570 --> 02:45:35.580 align:start position:0%
doesn't have control of and and I just
 
02:45:37.730 --> 02:45:37.740 align:start position:0%
think being you know us being aware of
 
02:45:40.790 --> 02:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
that and recognizing that is important
 
02:45:45.230 --> 02:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
I think it's on pages two and three one
 
02:45:46.910 --> 02:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
and two of the fixed text there's the
 
02:45:50.090 --> 02:45:50.100 align:start position:0%
fire department inspection and the home
 
02:45:51.770 --> 02:45:51.780 align:start position:0%
health inspection
 
02:45:53.389 --> 02:45:53.399 align:start position:0%
are those the ones you're talking about
 
02:45:56.210 --> 02:45:56.220 align:start position:0%
the home visits
 
02:45:58.250 --> 02:45:58.260 align:start position:0%
no the home visit is something separate
 
02:46:00.469 --> 02:46:00.479 align:start position:0%
okay then I think
 
02:46:03.830 --> 02:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
um but we are um we did find in section
 
02:46:06.230 --> 02:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh six four four six point one five
 
02:46:08.710 --> 02:46:08.720 align:start position:0%
would be the appropriate place to add
 
02:46:13.370 --> 02:46:13.380 align:start position:0%
that uh oh I apologize uh it starts on
 
02:46:13.380 --> 02:46:14.809 align:start position:0%
that uh oh I apologize uh it starts on
oh

02:46:14.809 --> 02:46:14.819 align:start position:0%
oh
 
02:46:17.270 --> 02:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
nope one four I'm sorry I'm looking at
 
02:46:18.889 --> 02:46:18.899 align:start position:0%
the wrong page
 
02:46:21.530 --> 02:46:21.540 align:start position:0%
um Page Six
 
02:46:24.670 --> 02:46:24.680 align:start position:0%
So within HEC
 
02:46:27.710 --> 02:46:27.720 align:start position:0%
6446.14 that section that would be the
 
02:46:30.530 --> 02:46:30.540 align:start position:0%
appropriate section to add
 
02:46:32.750 --> 02:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
um that the licensing or the application
 
02:46:34.849 --> 02:46:34.859 align:start position:0%
timeline begins
 
02:46:36.469 --> 02:46:36.479 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what letter we'll put it
 
02:46:38.330 --> 02:46:38.340 align:start position:0%
in yet but we're happy to add it in
 
02:46:41.570 --> 02:46:41.580 align:start position:0%
there for you okay
 
02:46:41.580 --> 02:46:42.950 align:start position:0%
there for you okay
fine

02:46:42.950 --> 02:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
fine
 
02:46:44.809 --> 02:46:44.819 align:start position:0%
in that case I'll move that we
 
02:46:46.550 --> 02:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
conditionally approve
 
02:46:48.889 --> 02:46:48.899 align:start position:0%
representative Leon um thank you madam
 
02:46:51.590 --> 02:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
chair um I did have some other questions
 
02:46:54.469 --> 02:46:54.479 align:start position:0%
in here as well I'm not sure it seems
 
02:46:56.389 --> 02:46:56.399 align:start position:0%
like there may be some constitutionality
 
02:46:58.250 --> 02:46:58.260 align:start position:0%
about having people's personal health
 
02:47:00.410 --> 02:47:00.420 align:start position:0%
information released from all federal
 
02:47:03.170 --> 02:47:03.180 align:start position:0%
and state protections let me scroll to
 
02:47:05.650 --> 02:47:05.660 align:start position:0%
that one here on
 
02:47:09.610 --> 02:47:09.620 align:start position:0%
page four at the bottom you sign a form
 
02:47:11.330 --> 02:47:11.340 align:start position:0%
providing your personal health
 
02:47:13.790 --> 02:47:13.800 align:start position:0%
information stating I understand that
 
02:47:15.410 --> 02:47:15.420 align:start position:0%
the health information I authorized
 
02:47:17.929 --> 02:47:17.939 align:start position:0%
disclosed to the licensing agency may be
 
02:47:19.790 --> 02:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
redisclosed as a part of the application
 
02:47:22.190 --> 02:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
for foster family care and no longer
 
02:47:24.230 --> 02:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
protected by federal and state privacy
 
02:47:27.290 --> 02:47:27.300 align:start position:0%
regulations that seems to be a pretty
 
02:47:29.630 --> 02:47:29.640 align:start position:0%
high request to people when we even
 
02:47:32.210 --> 02:47:32.220 align:start position:0%
tried the right to privacy into our
 
02:47:34.790 --> 02:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
constitution I recognize that there's
 
02:47:36.230 --> 02:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
some competing interests of these
 
02:47:37.490 --> 02:47:37.500 align:start position:0%
children and wanting to make sure that
 
02:47:39.469 --> 02:47:39.479 align:start position:0%
they're safe but giving
 
02:47:42.410 --> 02:47:42.420 align:start position:0%
taking away all protections for people's
 
02:47:44.090 --> 02:47:44.100 align:start position:0%
personal health information seems to go
 
02:47:46.370 --> 02:47:46.380 align:start position:0%
too far
 
02:47:48.950 --> 02:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
thank you I hadn't noticed that that's a
 
02:47:51.590 --> 02:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:54.410 --> 02:47:54.420 align:start position:0%
so this is a standard uh this is a
 
02:47:57.230 --> 02:47:57.240 align:start position:0%
standard language I'm sorry
 
02:47:59.030 --> 02:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
this is standard language that is
 
02:48:02.030 --> 02:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
included in everything and this is
 
02:48:04.429 --> 02:48:04.439 align:start position:0%
um basically it's Federal Regulations
 
02:48:07.849 --> 02:48:07.859 align:start position:0%
say that you have to it's not that
 
02:48:09.410 --> 02:48:09.420 align:start position:0%
you're no longer protected by federal
 
02:48:13.130 --> 02:48:13.140 align:start position:0%
privacy regulations per se it's that you
 
02:48:16.090 --> 02:48:16.100 align:start position:0%
are aware that you are signing something
 
02:48:19.250 --> 02:48:19.260 align:start position:0%
disclosing information uh to the to the
 
02:48:19.260 --> 02:48:20.990 align:start position:0%
disclosing information uh to the to the
Department

02:48:20.990 --> 02:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
Department
 
02:48:22.849 --> 02:48:22.859 align:start position:0%
I don't know if Jenna has anything else
 
02:48:24.290 --> 02:48:24.300 align:start position:0%
to add for that so
 
02:48:26.690 --> 02:48:26.700 align:start position:0%
generally my understanding is that we
 
02:48:28.309 --> 02:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
have to put people on notice that if you
 
02:48:30.110 --> 02:48:30.120 align:start position:0%
submit this to us and then we have to
 
02:48:31.550 --> 02:48:31.560 align:start position:0%
give it to the folks who are doing your
 
02:48:33.230 --> 02:48:33.240 align:start position:0%
home study that we are no longer in
 
02:48:34.730 --> 02:48:34.740 align:start position:0%
control of the information you gave us
 
02:48:37.190 --> 02:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
you gave us information on an agency
 
02:48:39.590 --> 02:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
form you gave it to an agency that's
 
02:48:41.750 --> 02:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
responsible for your privacy however as
 
02:48:44.030 --> 02:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
part of this process if it has to go to
 
02:48:46.490 --> 02:48:46.500 align:start position:0%
the next person in the line such as a
 
02:48:49.130 --> 02:48:49.140 align:start position:0%
consultant that does the home study we
 
02:48:51.410 --> 02:48:51.420 align:start position:0%
can't we can't offer you an assurance
 
02:48:53.750 --> 02:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
that that can be private because no
 
02:48:55.610 --> 02:48:55.620 align:start position:0%
longer within our control
 
02:48:58.670 --> 02:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
oh sorry it's a follow-up please yeah
 
02:49:00.349 --> 02:49:00.359 align:start position:0%
that seems rather concerning because
 
02:49:02.690 --> 02:49:02.700 align:start position:0%
with our personal health information and
 
02:49:05.389 --> 02:49:05.399 align:start position:0%
any other situation there are controls
 
02:49:07.610 --> 02:49:07.620 align:start position:0%
when that is disclosed to anybody else
 
02:49:09.830 --> 02:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
and not having those controls to your
 
02:49:12.349 --> 02:49:12.359 align:start position:0%
Consultants is is very concerning
 
02:49:14.330 --> 02:49:14.340 align:start position:0%
especially because when you look at the
 
02:49:16.670 --> 02:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
form that's included in here it has
 
02:49:18.710 --> 02:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
things like any past history of alcohol
 
02:49:21.110 --> 02:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
abuse let's say somebody abused alcohol
 
02:49:23.510 --> 02:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
when they're 14 years old it's any in
 
02:49:25.070 --> 02:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
sealed records it's in their medical
 
02:49:27.650 --> 02:49:27.660 align:start position:0%
history now that's being shared with
 
02:49:29.510 --> 02:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
somebody who doesn't have any disclosure
 
02:49:31.309 --> 02:49:31.319 align:start position:0%
requirements from the department and
 
02:49:32.809 --> 02:49:32.819 align:start position:0%
this could impact their standing in the
 
02:49:35.690 --> 02:49:35.700 align:start position:0%
community and anywhere else that's it's
 
02:49:37.790 --> 02:49:37.800 align:start position:0%
very troubling
 
02:49:39.590 --> 02:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
will our foster care license
 
02:49:42.050 --> 02:49:42.060 align:start position:0%
applications are confidential they are
 
02:49:44.210 --> 02:49:44.220 align:start position:0%
not open to anybody in the community and
 
02:49:45.830 --> 02:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
for the Department it's very important
 
02:49:47.929 --> 02:49:47.939 align:start position:0%
in terms of when we're placing children
 
02:49:50.330 --> 02:49:50.340 align:start position:0%
in foster care homes that we have a full
 
02:49:53.270 --> 02:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
assessment of all the issues
 
02:49:55.730 --> 02:49:55.740 align:start position:0%
um that the prospective foster parents
 
02:49:59.809 --> 02:49:59.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:59.819 --> 02:50:01.550 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:50:01.550 --> 02:50:01.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:50:05.450 --> 02:50:05.460 align:start position:0%
Senator thank you uh Madam chair I you
 
02:50:05.460 --> 02:50:06.309 align:start position:0%
Senator thank you uh Madam chair I you
know

02:50:06.309 --> 02:50:06.319 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:50:08.690 --> 02:50:08.700 align:start position:0%
this is
 
02:50:11.270 --> 02:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
in place for the protection of children
 
02:50:15.050 --> 02:50:15.060 align:start position:0%
it's really clear it says in just in the
 
02:50:17.330 --> 02:50:17.340 align:start position:0%
part we have in front of us
 
02:50:17.340 --> 02:50:18.170 align:start position:0%
part we have in front of us
um

02:50:18.170 --> 02:50:18.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:21.230 --> 02:50:21.240 align:start position:0%
there are lines that are very clear that
 
02:50:23.389 --> 02:50:23.399 align:start position:0%
I'm specifically releasing only the
 
02:50:25.370 --> 02:50:25.380 align:start position:0%
mental health information listed in the
 
02:50:27.050 --> 02:50:27.060 align:start position:0%
health history below
 
02:50:29.150 --> 02:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
um it says I understand I am not
 
02:50:31.790 --> 02:50:31.800 align:start position:0%
required to sign this form however if I
 
02:50:35.809 --> 02:50:35.819 align:start position:0%
do sign so on and so forth I understand
 
02:50:39.590 --> 02:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
the health information I I or authorized
 
02:50:42.910 --> 02:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
disclosed to the licensing agency may be
 
02:50:46.790 --> 02:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
redisclosed so nothing is being
 
02:50:49.670 --> 02:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
it does not appear to me in any way that
 
02:50:51.410 --> 02:50:51.420 align:start position:0%
this is being
 
02:50:53.630 --> 02:50:53.640 align:start position:0%
um secretive or you know something is
 
02:50:55.969 --> 02:50:55.979 align:start position:0%
being done against a person's will if
 
02:50:57.650 --> 02:50:57.660 align:start position:0%
you want to take on the responsibility
 
02:51:00.110 --> 02:51:00.120 align:start position:0%
of caring for children through the
 
02:51:03.349 --> 02:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
foster care system there these are some
 
02:51:06.170 --> 02:51:06.180 align:start position:0%
of the conditions which one must agree
 
02:51:08.690 --> 02:51:08.700 align:start position:0%
to and that seems completely reasonable
 
02:51:12.610 --> 02:51:12.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:15.110 --> 02:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
thank you as a follow-up I'm very
 
02:51:17.090 --> 02:51:17.100 align:start position:0%
concerned I'd like to know what rules
 
02:51:19.130 --> 02:51:19.140 align:start position:0%
there are regarding your consultants and
 
02:51:20.929 --> 02:51:20.939 align:start position:0%
what Freedom they have or restrictions
 
02:51:22.790 --> 02:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
they have on disclosing this personal
 
02:51:25.070 --> 02:51:25.080 align:start position:0%
health information which would fall out
 
02:51:27.410 --> 02:51:27.420 align:start position:0%
seems to me from your your statements
 
02:51:29.809 --> 02:51:29.819 align:start position:0%
about the protections that happen within
 
02:51:31.370 --> 02:51:31.380 align:start position:0%
the department are one thing but as soon
 
02:51:32.990 --> 02:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
as you give this to a consultant you
 
02:51:35.090 --> 02:51:35.100 align:start position:0%
have no control over that information
 
02:51:37.550 --> 02:51:37.560 align:start position:0%
that seems to be a lot further than the
 
02:51:39.830 --> 02:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
department determining that somebody's
 
02:51:42.230 --> 02:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
prior medical history puts a foster
 
02:51:44.330 --> 02:51:44.340 align:start position:0%
child at risk and by giving it to a
 
02:51:46.309 --> 02:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
consultant who has no constraints that
 
02:51:48.110 --> 02:51:48.120 align:start position:0%
seems to be a massive violation of
 
02:51:48.120 --> 02:52:00.250 align:start position:0%
seems to be a massive violation of
privacy

02:52:00.250 --> 02:52:00.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:03.290 --> 02:52:03.300 align:start position:0%
so any consultant that does work with us
 
02:52:07.490 --> 02:52:07.500 align:start position:0%
is bound by our HIPAA privacy laws there
 
02:52:09.290 --> 02:52:09.300 align:start position:0%
is a provision in HIPAA and I'm getting
 
02:52:10.849 --> 02:52:10.859 align:start position:0%
a I don't want to because I don't know
 
02:52:13.670 --> 02:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
HIPAA extremely well but there is
 
02:52:16.730 --> 02:52:16.740 align:start position:0%
whenever there is HIPAA information it a
 
02:52:19.370 --> 02:52:19.380 align:start position:0%
person has to authorize as Senator
 
02:52:21.889 --> 02:52:21.899 align:start position:0%
Chanley said the disclosure of that
 
02:52:24.530 --> 02:52:24.540 align:start position:0%
information it does not mean that the
 
02:52:27.950 --> 02:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
it's just it's a provision for HIPAA but
 
02:52:29.929 --> 02:52:29.939 align:start position:0%
our consultants and we have many child
 
02:52:32.870 --> 02:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
placing agencies they are themselves
 
02:52:36.830 --> 02:52:36.840 align:start position:0%
anybody who any entity that has personal
 
02:52:39.230 --> 02:52:39.240 align:start position:0%
health information is also Bound by
 
02:52:39.240 --> 02:52:45.349 align:start position:0%
health information is also Bound by
HIPAA

02:52:45.349 --> 02:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:47.990 --> 02:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
sorry uh thank you uh the protections
 
02:52:50.090 --> 02:52:50.100 align:start position:0%
given by HIPAA that people are commonly
 
02:52:52.610 --> 02:52:52.620 align:start position:0%
understand aren't as strong as we would
 
02:52:55.010 --> 02:52:55.020 align:start position:0%
hope and believe that they are
 
02:52:57.889 --> 02:52:57.899 align:start position:0%
so when the department has contractors
 
02:52:59.809 --> 02:52:59.819 align:start position:0%
um there's typically
 
02:53:01.969 --> 02:53:01.979 align:start position:0%
various agreements and contracts that
 
02:53:05.389 --> 02:53:05.399 align:start position:0%
they're that they're signing to be a
 
02:53:08.510 --> 02:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
contractor of the department
 
02:53:11.809 --> 02:53:11.819 align:start position:0%
um and that again is something that
 
02:53:14.150 --> 02:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
is included in that contract they are
 
02:53:15.950 --> 02:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
bound by whatever the department is
 
02:53:17.330 --> 02:53:17.340 align:start position:0%
bound by
 
02:53:22.730 --> 02:53:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:25.849 --> 02:53:25.859 align:start position:0%
follow-up uh thank you I guess I uh I'll
 
02:53:28.070 --> 02:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
I'll back off of this one but I will
 
02:53:29.809 --> 02:53:29.819 align:start position:0%
want before approving it I would like to
 
02:53:31.849 --> 02:53:31.859 align:start position:0%
have more information on those
 
02:53:33.530 --> 02:53:33.540 align:start position:0%
agreements and that protection within
 
02:53:35.570 --> 02:53:35.580 align:start position:0%
those contracts I do also want to note
 
02:53:35.580 --> 02:53:36.469 align:start position:0%
those contracts I do also want to note
too

02:53:36.469 --> 02:53:36.479 align:start position:0%
too
 
02:53:38.929 --> 02:53:38.939 align:start position:0%
um there was an emergency rule that was
 
02:53:41.150 --> 02:53:41.160 align:start position:0%
in place regarding an exemption for a
 
02:53:42.710 --> 02:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
covet vaccine
 
02:53:45.769 --> 02:53:45.779 align:start position:0%
um and this rule does also
 
02:53:48.950 --> 02:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
um Encompass that exemption that we did
 
02:53:51.650 --> 02:53:51.660 align:start position:0%
promise in 2020 if it came to be we
 
02:53:54.170 --> 02:53:54.180 align:start position:0%
would add it into our rules so without
 
02:53:56.090 --> 02:53:56.100 align:start position:0%
approving this rule that exemption does
 
02:53:57.889 --> 02:53:57.899 align:start position:0%
go away
 
02:54:01.490 --> 02:54:01.500 align:start position:0%
thank you director Morrow thank you
 
02:54:02.750 --> 02:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
madam chairman
 
02:54:04.670 --> 02:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
um I think the Departments sort of
 
02:54:06.769 --> 02:54:06.779 align:start position:0%
addressed this already I was wondering
 
02:54:09.950 --> 02:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
if the consultant is someone that is
 
02:54:12.050 --> 02:54:12.060 align:start position:0%
hired by the department as opposed to
 
02:54:15.230 --> 02:54:15.240 align:start position:0%
somebody being in the department and if
 
02:54:17.710 --> 02:54:17.720 align:start position:0%
so I assume they're hired by contract
 
02:54:20.570 --> 02:54:20.580 align:start position:0%
and that there certainly could be
 
02:54:23.389 --> 02:54:23.399 align:start position:0%
something in the contract and say to the
 
02:54:25.910 --> 02:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
contractor that you shall not the
 
02:54:27.530 --> 02:54:27.540 align:start position:0%
consultant that you shall not release
 
02:54:33.349 --> 02:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:35.750 --> 02:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
and that may be based on what they've
 
02:54:35.760 --> 02:54:36.469 align:start position:0%
and that may be based on what they've
said

02:54:36.469 --> 02:54:36.479 align:start position:0%
said
 
02:54:37.790 --> 02:54:37.800 align:start position:0%
yes so
 
02:54:37.800 --> 02:54:41.510 align:start position:0%
yes so
um

02:54:41.510 --> 02:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:43.910 --> 02:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
area of expertise but whenever the
 
02:54:47.990 --> 02:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
department does contract uh with uh with
 
02:54:49.849 --> 02:54:49.859 align:start position:0%
outside vendors
 
02:54:51.050 --> 02:54:51.060 align:start position:0%
um there are
 
02:54:53.030 --> 02:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
and it goes to GNC there are all
 
02:54:54.830 --> 02:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
protections there are HIPAA Protections
 
02:54:57.170 --> 02:54:57.180 align:start position:0%
in there there are
 
02:54:59.210 --> 02:54:59.220 align:start position:0%
um what we would call business associate
 
02:55:01.429 --> 02:55:01.439 align:start position:0%
agreements that allow us to share that
 
02:55:03.830 --> 02:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
information so that protection goes
 
02:55:06.170 --> 02:55:06.180 align:start position:0%
through the through the uh
 
02:55:09.349 --> 02:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
um if I understand correctly
 
02:55:11.809 --> 02:55:11.819 align:start position:0%
the health information may be
 
02:55:13.969 --> 02:55:13.979 align:start position:0%
redisclosed as part of the application
 
02:55:16.910 --> 02:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
that's fine that's what you do but I
 
02:55:18.830 --> 02:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
don't believe that it's actually true
 
02:55:21.590 --> 02:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
that it's no longer protected by state
 
02:55:23.690 --> 02:55:23.700 align:start position:0%
and and federal privacy regulations
 
02:55:25.790 --> 02:55:25.800 align:start position:0%
because you're enforcing them
 
02:55:29.570 --> 02:55:29.580 align:start position:0%
as part of the process is that
 
02:55:33.110 --> 02:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
I believe again I would defer to my
 
02:55:34.429 --> 02:55:34.439 align:start position:0%
fellow panelists here because you know
 
02:55:37.130 --> 02:55:37.140 align:start position:0%
but HIPAA requires a redisclosure
 
02:55:39.849 --> 02:55:39.859 align:start position:0%
statement whenever you are
 
02:55:42.349 --> 02:55:42.359 align:start position:0%
disclosing information and this is part
 
02:55:43.510 --> 02:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
of I believe
 
02:55:46.309 --> 02:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
just redisclosure yes you are
 
02:55:48.769 --> 02:55:48.779 align:start position:0%
redisclosing it but I don't believe it's
 
02:55:50.330 --> 02:55:50.340 align:start position:0%
no longer protected by federal
 
02:55:52.429 --> 02:55:52.439 align:start position:0%
regulations federal and state
 
02:55:55.969 --> 02:55:55.979 align:start position:0%
regulations because you are enforcing
 
02:55:57.889 --> 02:55:57.899 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:56:00.170 --> 02:56:00.180 align:start position:0%
the Privacy requirement on your people
 
02:56:02.269 --> 02:56:02.279 align:start position:0%
and your contractors
 
02:56:09.250 --> 02:56:09.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:15.530 --> 02:56:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:18.950 --> 02:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
so Allison if you look on page five
 
02:56:21.650 --> 02:56:21.660 align:start position:0%
um a that second paragraph I kind of
 
02:56:24.889 --> 02:56:24.899 align:start position:0%
liked it it says um I understand the
 
02:56:26.389 --> 02:56:26.399 align:start position:0%
health information and then you move on
 
02:56:27.889 --> 02:56:27.899 align:start position:0%
to the second sentence to the end it
 
02:56:29.929 --> 02:56:29.939 align:start position:0%
says end no longer protected by federal
 
02:56:32.210 --> 02:56:32.220 align:start position:0%
and state privacy regulations I think
 
02:56:34.670 --> 02:56:34.680 align:start position:0%
that's what's being asked if that can
 
02:56:46.550 --> 02:56:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:48.590 --> 02:56:48.600 align:start position:0%
we will have to look into that for the
 
02:56:48.600 --> 02:56:49.610 align:start position:0%
we will have to look into that for the
committee

02:56:49.610 --> 02:56:49.620 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:56:51.590 --> 02:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
um as we understand it with standard
 
02:56:51.600 --> 02:56:53.929 align:start position:0%
um as we understand it with standard
language

02:56:53.929 --> 02:56:53.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:55.670 --> 02:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
yes that's where we usually get into
 
02:56:55.680 --> 02:56:56.950 align:start position:0%
yes that's where we usually get into
trouble

02:56:56.950 --> 02:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
trouble
 
02:56:59.389 --> 02:56:59.399 align:start position:0%
representative land um thank you madam
 
02:57:02.389 --> 02:57:02.399 align:start position:0%
chair I have a another another point and
 
02:57:04.670 --> 02:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
another question to address as well okay
 
02:57:06.530 --> 02:57:06.540 align:start position:0%
if we look on the bottom of page six
 
02:57:09.650 --> 02:57:09.660 align:start position:0%
there is H1 which is speaking to all
 
02:57:11.750 --> 02:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
children who are household members need
 
02:57:14.330 --> 02:57:14.340 align:start position:0%
to be up to up to date on ASAP
 
02:57:16.190 --> 02:57:16.200 align:start position:0%
um right now they're the language of
 
02:57:18.290 --> 02:57:18.300 align:start position:0%
House Bill 408 has passed both bodies
 
02:57:20.030 --> 02:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
and it's on its way to enrollment and
 
02:57:21.530 --> 02:57:21.540 align:start position:0%
then to the governor
 
02:57:23.809 --> 02:57:23.819 align:start position:0%
um that should happen before this rule
 
02:57:26.450 --> 02:57:26.460 align:start position:0%
needs to be approved and that would make
 
02:57:28.550 --> 02:57:28.560 align:start position:0%
those lines need to change because the
 
02:57:30.469 --> 02:57:30.479 align:start position:0%
those children will no longer be the
 
02:57:32.389 --> 02:57:32.399 align:start position:0%
only people in the State subject to the
 
02:57:35.510 --> 02:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
asip requirements as a mandate
 
02:57:39.349 --> 02:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
um so I would like to see that changed
 
02:57:41.929 --> 02:57:41.939 align:start position:0%
before our next meeting so it'll be in
 
02:57:43.969 --> 02:57:43.979 align:start position:0%
consistent with the language assuming
 
02:57:46.130 --> 02:57:46.140 align:start position:0%
that the governor doesn't veto
 
02:57:48.110 --> 02:57:48.120 align:start position:0%
um that bill because otherwise we're
 
02:57:53.389 --> 02:57:53.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:53.399 --> 02:57:54.769 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:57:54.769 --> 02:57:54.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:57:59.330 --> 02:57:59.340 align:start position:0%
HB 40 requires the department to apply
 
02:58:03.110 --> 02:58:03.120 align:start position:0%
for a waiver from the federal government
 
02:58:05.870 --> 02:58:05.880 align:start position:0%
so that it
 
02:58:08.150 --> 02:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
the reality is is that we don't know if
 
02:58:09.590 --> 02:58:09.600 align:start position:0%
we have the waiver yet from the federal
 
02:58:09.600 --> 02:58:10.929 align:start position:0%
we have the waiver yet from the federal
government

02:58:10.929 --> 02:58:10.939 align:start position:0%
government
 
02:58:13.849 --> 02:58:13.859 align:start position:0%
it doesn't change these rules it
 
02:58:16.370 --> 02:58:16.380 align:start position:0%
requires us to apply for a waiver and if
 
02:58:19.309 --> 02:58:19.319 align:start position:0%
you get the waiver you will then need to
 
02:58:20.990 --> 02:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
change the rules to agree with it we
 
02:58:24.349 --> 02:58:24.359 align:start position:0%
will but we will not know that until we
 
02:58:26.809 --> 02:58:26.819 align:start position:0%
have until October 1st to apply for the
 
02:58:28.730 --> 02:58:28.740 align:start position:0%
waiver and then it's a several month
 
02:58:31.849 --> 02:58:31.859 align:start position:0%
process after that okay so as if I have
 
02:58:34.010 --> 02:58:34.020 align:start position:0%
a follow-up on that follow-up um that
 
02:58:36.050 --> 02:58:36.060 align:start position:0%
that bill is a two-section bill
 
02:58:37.610 --> 02:58:37.620 align:start position:0%
um the first that's the second section
 
02:58:39.590 --> 02:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
requires the waiver but the first
 
02:58:42.349 --> 02:58:42.359 align:start position:0%
section states that upon passage there
 
02:58:44.389 --> 02:58:44.399 align:start position:0%
shall be no vaccination or immunization
 
02:58:46.550 --> 02:58:46.560 align:start position:0%
requirements required of any children
 
02:58:48.950 --> 02:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
residing in a foster home that exceed
 
02:58:50.630 --> 02:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
the vaccination or immunization
 
02:58:54.190 --> 02:58:54.200 align:start position:0%
requirements under RSA
 
02:58:56.570 --> 02:58:56.580 align:start position:0%
141c20a and either in type of
 
02:59:00.710 --> 02:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
vaccination or quantity of doses is that
 
02:59:04.670 --> 02:59:04.680 align:start position:0%
still not yet into law when it becomes
 
02:59:04.680 --> 02:59:05.570 align:start position:0%
still not yet into law when it becomes
law

02:59:05.570 --> 02:59:05.580 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:59:08.630 --> 02:59:08.640 align:start position:0%
then the rule will have to be changed is
 
02:59:11.809 --> 02:59:11.819 align:start position:0%
that correct yes but it is not yet law
 
02:59:13.849 --> 02:59:13.859 align:start position:0%
and again I don't have the most recent
 
02:59:16.370 --> 02:59:16.380 align:start position:0%
version of HP 408 I I must confess I
 
02:59:18.170 --> 02:59:18.180 align:start position:0%
didn't follow it through I don't know if
 
02:59:19.070 --> 02:59:19.080 align:start position:0%
it went through the committee of
 
02:59:20.809 --> 02:59:20.819 align:start position:0%
conference because the two thousands
 
02:59:23.990 --> 02:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
were different but my uh recollection of
 
02:59:26.269 --> 02:59:26.279 align:start position:0%
the first section of this of the bill
 
02:59:29.210 --> 02:59:29.220 align:start position:0%
was in current statute that that was not
 
02:59:31.610 --> 02:59:31.620 align:start position:0%
an amendment to current statue but I
 
02:59:33.950 --> 02:59:33.960 align:start position:0%
don't again I don't know what the uh
 
02:59:35.389 --> 02:59:35.399 align:start position:0%
what came out of the committee of
 
02:59:38.090 --> 02:59:38.100 align:start position:0%
conference okay well as a follow-up I'm
 
02:59:39.410 --> 02:59:39.420 align:start position:0%
actually the vice chairman of that
 
02:59:41.030 --> 02:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
committee we did not have a committee of
 
02:59:42.889 --> 02:59:42.899 align:start position:0%
conference we agreed with the Senate and
 
02:59:44.990 --> 02:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
that is in addition to the law I'm
 
02:59:46.370 --> 02:59:46.380 align:start position:0%
thinking that with all of these
 
02:59:47.990 --> 02:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
different issues I wonder if it would be
 
02:59:49.610 --> 02:59:49.620 align:start position:0%
appropriate to move postponement because
 
02:59:51.650 --> 02:59:51.660 align:start position:0%
the jail card diedline is not until July
 
02:59:54.410 --> 02:59:54.420 align:start position:0%
24th and to try and have some clarity on
 
02:59:55.969 --> 02:59:55.979 align:start position:0%
these issues and see if this has been
 
02:59:58.309 --> 02:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
signed into law at that point
 
02:59:59.809 --> 02:59:59.819 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if that would be an
 
03:00:02.150 --> 03:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate motion manager um and just
 
03:00:05.090 --> 03:00:05.100 align:start position:0%
oh sorry I am going to say that this is
 
03:00:06.110 --> 03:00:06.120 align:start position:0%
actually something that's in current
 
03:00:06.120 --> 03:00:07.309 align:start position:0%
actually something that's in current
rule

03:00:07.309 --> 03:00:07.319 align:start position:0%
rule
 
03:00:09.710 --> 03:00:09.720 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know how that even affects
 
03:00:12.410 --> 03:00:12.420 align:start position:0%
at this point if we hold off on this
 
03:00:14.929 --> 03:00:14.939 align:start position:0%
well and I also just to reiterate what
 
03:00:16.969 --> 03:00:16.979 align:start position:0%
Allison said earlier uh part of this
 
03:00:19.250 --> 03:00:19.260 align:start position:0%
rule is also an emergency rule right now
 
03:00:22.130 --> 03:00:22.140 align:start position:0%
to exempt Foster families from having to
 
03:00:24.230 --> 03:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
vaccinate their children with the covid
 
03:00:26.389 --> 03:00:26.399 align:start position:0%
vaccine so if this is postponed that
 
03:00:29.809 --> 03:00:29.819 align:start position:0%
emergency rule will expire and therefore
 
03:00:31.849 --> 03:00:31.859 align:start position:0%
will no longer be valid the emergency
 
03:00:34.070 --> 03:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
rule expires when
 
03:00:36.230 --> 03:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
um just a moment unless Allison has it
 
03:00:38.570 --> 03:00:38.580 align:start position:0%
right off the top of her head
 
03:00:40.250 --> 03:00:40.260 align:start position:0%
I actually think it expired within this
 
03:00:42.410 --> 03:00:42.420 align:start position:0%
process a couple weeks ago oh it's
 
03:00:43.730 --> 03:00:43.740 align:start position:0%
already expired yeah
 
03:00:46.130 --> 03:00:46.140 align:start position:0%
yeah then never mind
 
03:00:47.690 --> 03:00:47.700 align:start position:0%
but I can come well since it's already
 
03:00:49.429 --> 03:00:49.439 align:start position:0%
expired we don't need to worry about it
 
03:00:49.439 --> 03:00:50.929 align:start position:0%
expired we don't need to worry about it
exactly

03:00:50.929 --> 03:00:50.939 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
03:00:54.349 --> 03:00:54.359 align:start position:0%
um we we could move to postpone it or we
 
03:00:57.110 --> 03:00:57.120 align:start position:0%
could preliminarily object
 
03:01:00.469 --> 03:01:00.479 align:start position:0%
and I would like I'll move that we've
 
03:01:02.990 --> 03:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
preliminary object until you can resolve
 
03:01:04.969 --> 03:01:04.979 align:start position:0%
the privacy issues
 
03:01:08.570 --> 03:01:08.580 align:start position:0%
because I'm concerned about that
 
03:01:08.580 --> 03:01:09.769 align:start position:0%
because I'm concerned about that
okay

03:01:09.769 --> 03:01:09.779 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:01:13.070 --> 03:01:13.080 align:start position:0%
any discussion no no we need more
 
03:01:13.080 --> 03:01:15.110 align:start position:0%
any discussion no no we need more
information

03:01:15.110 --> 03:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:01:18.070 --> 03:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
all right did we have a second yes yes
 
03:01:21.410 --> 03:01:21.420 align:start position:0%
representative lay on seconded
 
03:01:21.420 --> 03:01:22.550 align:start position:0%
representative lay on seconded
hey

03:01:22.550 --> 03:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
hey
 
03:01:24.830 --> 03:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
no no further discussion those in favor
 
03:01:27.349 --> 03:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
uh opposed
 
03:01:30.110 --> 03:01:30.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much we have an
 
03:01:32.269 --> 03:01:32.279 align:start position:0%
objection and we hope you will
 
03:01:34.429 --> 03:01:34.439 align:start position:0%
give us some more information the last
 
03:01:36.910 --> 03:01:36.920 align:start position:0%
one is 2023
 
03:01:41.389 --> 03:01:41.399 align:start position:0%
55 Marie waited very patiently
 
03:01:44.450 --> 03:01:44.460 align:start position:0%
um uh we pulled this off consent is
 
03:01:48.530 --> 03:01:48.540 align:start position:0%
about employment 300 rules and
 
03:01:51.469 --> 03:01:51.479 align:start position:0%
um it's just a minor change but it was
 
03:01:55.070 --> 03:01:55.080 align:start position:0%
substantive so we wanted to do a oral
 
03:01:58.190 --> 03:01:58.200 align:start position:0%
conditional approval on page two of the
 
03:02:03.710 --> 03:02:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:07.370 --> 03:02:07.380 align:start position:0%
um subsections two and three on page two
 
03:02:10.670 --> 03:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
um the the numbers you see in
 
03:02:14.510 --> 03:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
um two and three are incorrect and so
 
03:02:17.630 --> 03:02:17.640 align:start position:0%
they want to change the The One and Two
 
03:02:21.710 --> 03:02:21.720 align:start position:0%
from 51 to 500 cross that out and make
 
03:02:21.720 --> 03:02:22.550 align:start position:0%
from 51 to 500 cross that out and make
it

03:02:22.550 --> 03:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:02:25.190 --> 03:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
10 500.
 
03:02:27.410 --> 03:02:27.420 align:start position:0%
and the other one in number three you
 
03:02:30.650 --> 03:02:30.660 align:start position:0%
would cross out 501 and make that 10
 
03:02:30.660 --> 03:02:34.250 align:start position:0%
would cross out 501 and make that 10
501.

03:02:34.250 --> 03:02:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:37.309 --> 03:02:37.319 align:start position:0%
and the agency can explain why it was
 
03:02:39.230 --> 03:02:39.240 align:start position:0%
that they needed to change those
 
03:02:41.690 --> 03:02:41.700 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:02:43.730 --> 03:02:43.740 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair members of the
 
03:02:45.469 --> 03:02:45.479 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Marie Helen
 
03:02:47.690 --> 03:02:47.700 align:start position:0%
baylinson and I'm here on behalf of the
 
03:02:50.030 --> 03:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire employment security
 
03:02:53.090 --> 03:02:53.100 align:start position:0%
um the yes the um the
 
03:02:55.429 --> 03:02:55.439 align:start position:0%
um rule wasn't consent calendar but when
 
03:02:57.889 --> 03:02:57.899 align:start position:0%
I was doing the final review yesterday I
 
03:03:00.769 --> 03:03:00.779 align:start position:0%
noticed that um there was a substantive
 
03:03:04.370 --> 03:03:04.380 align:start position:0%
change basically as you understand from
 
03:03:09.730 --> 03:03:09.740 align:start position:0%
our rule filing the rules uh generally
 
03:03:11.590 --> 03:03:11.600 align:start position:0%
relate to
 
03:03:14.150 --> 03:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
the different methods of filing
 
03:03:16.750 --> 03:03:16.760 align:start position:0%
requirements dependent on how many
 
03:03:21.550 --> 03:03:21.560 align:start position:0%
employer employees the agent or
 
03:03:25.070 --> 03:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
employer is filing the employee tax and
 
03:03:27.830 --> 03:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
wage report on
 
03:03:30.650 --> 03:03:30.660 align:start position:0%
um current rules so so it could be paper
 
03:03:35.809 --> 03:03:35.819 align:start position:0%
report electronic uh via a CD or
 
03:03:39.410 --> 03:03:39.420 align:start position:0%
um by our online web tax system well
 
03:03:42.170 --> 03:03:42.180 align:start position:0%
recently we've expanded our online web
 
03:03:44.269 --> 03:03:44.279 align:start position:0%
web tax system made changes to the
 
03:03:46.849 --> 03:03:46.859 align:start position:0%
system so that an employer or agent can
 
03:03:49.550 --> 03:03:49.560 align:start position:0%
file the entire tax and wage report
 
03:03:51.230 --> 03:03:51.240 align:start position:0%
um if they have if they're filing on
 
03:03:54.849 --> 03:03:54.859 align:start position:0%
behalf of up to 10 500
 
03:03:58.070 --> 03:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
employees or um what they call wage
 
03:04:00.710 --> 03:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
lines because an employee can have a big
 
03:04:02.450 --> 03:04:02.460 align:start position:0%
enough wage that it takes up two wage
 
03:04:05.030 --> 03:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
lines so we in our current rules we have
 
03:04:08.630 --> 03:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
500 employees and so that's inaccurate
 
03:04:11.570 --> 03:04:11.580 align:start position:0%
it should be ten thousand five and then
 
03:04:15.110 --> 03:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
so 51 to 10 to 10 000 five employees and
 
03:04:17.210 --> 03:04:17.220 align:start position:0%
an employer agent can file
 
03:04:19.910 --> 03:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
um on the um online on the webtech
 
03:04:22.330 --> 03:04:22.340 align:start position:0%
system or um
 
03:04:25.510 --> 03:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
or via paper report in electronic media
 
03:04:29.870 --> 03:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
and then and it reverts back to paper
 
03:04:32.990 --> 03:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
and electronic media if there are
 
03:04:35.690 --> 03:04:35.700 align:start position:0%
um more you know ten thousand five or
 
03:04:38.570 --> 03:04:38.580 align:start position:0%
one employees or more so that's the
 
03:04:40.250 --> 03:04:40.260 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
03:04:40.260 --> 03:04:41.150 align:start position:0%
that's the
um

03:04:41.150 --> 03:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:43.370 --> 03:04:43.380 align:start position:0%
that's the change that we would like to
 
03:04:44.870 --> 03:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
make like to have the opportunity to
 
03:04:46.849 --> 03:04:46.859 align:start position:0%
make to make things accurate before we
 
03:04:49.010 --> 03:04:49.020 align:start position:0%
can um ask the committee whether we can
 
03:04:52.490 --> 03:04:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:55.070 --> 03:04:55.080 align:start position:0%
discussion questions
 
03:04:58.429 --> 03:04:58.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:00.410 --> 03:05:00.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:05:02.330 --> 03:05:02.340 align:start position:0%
I'll move the we conditionally approved
 
03:05:04.849 --> 03:05:04.859 align:start position:0%
with the the corrections as noted
 
03:05:06.130 --> 03:05:06.140 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
03:05:08.410 --> 03:05:08.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:05:13.010 --> 03:05:13.020 align:start position:0%
this further discussion those in favor I
 
03:05:13.020 --> 03:05:14.630 align:start position:0%
this further discussion those in favor I
opposed

03:05:14.630 --> 03:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
03:05:16.670 --> 03:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much thank you
 
03:05:18.590 --> 03:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
very much Madam chair yes I was
 
03:05:22.269 --> 03:05:22.279 align:start position:0%
uncertain as to who the second was
 
03:05:24.290 --> 03:05:24.300 align:start position:0%
a little bit ahead
 
03:05:31.250 --> 03:05:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:34.070 --> 03:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
all right Madam chair we do have I
 
03:05:36.230 --> 03:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
believe one item of other business
 
03:05:37.910 --> 03:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
which is
 
03:05:41.150 --> 03:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:42.950 --> 03:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
so there's been
 
03:05:45.349 --> 03:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
um some public testimony that came in
 
03:05:48.650 --> 03:05:48.660 align:start position:0%
after the last fish and game rule
 
03:05:50.750 --> 03:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
um and the concern
 
03:05:50.760 --> 03:05:52.969 align:start position:0%
um and the concern
of

03:05:52.969 --> 03:05:52.979 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:05:54.889 --> 03:05:54.899 align:start position:0%
is is that some of the fish and game
 
03:05:57.950 --> 03:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
rules May violate The Endangered Species
 
03:05:57.960 --> 03:05:58.790 align:start position:0%
rules May violate The Endangered Species
Act

03:05:58.790 --> 03:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
Act
 
03:06:02.090 --> 03:06:02.100 align:start position:0%
so um I did some research and
 
03:06:02.100 --> 03:06:02.690 align:start position:0%
so um I did some research and
um

03:06:02.690 --> 03:06:02.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:04.429 --> 03:06:04.439 align:start position:0%
their concern was that the fish and game
 
03:06:06.830 --> 03:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
coyote hunting roles are violating The
 
03:06:10.790 --> 03:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
Endangered Species Act because
 
03:06:13.309 --> 03:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
um a New Hampshire Hunter could take a
 
03:06:13.319 --> 03:06:14.870 align:start position:0%
um a New Hampshire Hunter could take a
wolf

03:06:14.870 --> 03:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
wolf
 
03:06:18.530 --> 03:06:18.540 align:start position:0%
um on accident while hunting coyote and
 
03:06:20.450 --> 03:06:20.460 align:start position:0%
the argument is the same as the if you
 
03:06:22.550 --> 03:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
remember the bobcat
 
03:06:25.610 --> 03:06:25.620 align:start position:0%
argument it was it was they could take a
 
03:06:27.230 --> 03:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
lengths which is on the endangered
 
03:06:29.389 --> 03:06:29.399 align:start position:0%
species list
 
03:06:31.969 --> 03:06:31.979 align:start position:0%
um and they're at that time Aaron wrote
 
03:06:34.190 --> 03:06:34.200 align:start position:0%
a comment and said that there's no
 
03:06:36.710 --> 03:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
evidence of a bobcat or of a lynx being
 
03:06:38.570 --> 03:06:38.580 align:start position:0%
taken so he couldn't make a
 
03:06:41.090 --> 03:06:41.100 align:start position:0%
determination if it violated the rule
 
03:06:42.710 --> 03:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
the law
 
03:06:44.389 --> 03:06:44.399 align:start position:0%
um this situation is a little different
 
03:06:47.210 --> 03:06:47.220 align:start position:0%
because the gray wolf was actually taken
 
03:06:50.510 --> 03:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
off of the endangered species list in
 
03:06:54.469 --> 03:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
2021 January of 2021 and those are the
 
03:06:56.410 --> 03:06:56.420 align:start position:0%
only wolves you would find in this area
 
03:07:00.110 --> 03:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
and So currently they're not a part of
 
03:07:02.210 --> 03:07:02.220 align:start position:0%
The Endangered Species Act anymore there
 
03:07:05.510 --> 03:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
is legislation or I'm sorry there is
 
03:07:07.790 --> 03:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
um some cases that are going through
 
03:07:09.650 --> 03:07:09.660 align:start position:0%
they're trying to get it back on the the
 
03:07:12.889 --> 03:07:12.899 align:start position:0%
list but those cases have not been fully
 
03:07:15.469 --> 03:07:15.479 align:start position:0%
gone through the full process but as of
 
03:07:15.479 --> 03:07:16.849 align:start position:0%
gone through the full process but as of
now

03:07:16.849 --> 03:07:16.859 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:07:19.910 --> 03:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
um the the rules are fine because the
 
03:07:21.710 --> 03:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
gray wolf is not on the endangered
 
03:07:23.870 --> 03:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
species list we wanted to bring this to
 
03:07:25.610 --> 03:07:25.620 align:start position:0%
your attention one because there was
 
03:07:28.309 --> 03:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
some concern but also because
 
03:07:31.849 --> 03:07:31.859 align:start position:0%
um this Endangered Species Act
 
03:07:35.690 --> 03:07:35.700 align:start position:0%
um argument will likely come up in other
 
03:07:35.700 --> 03:07:36.290 align:start position:0%
um argument will likely come up in other
um

03:07:36.290 --> 03:07:36.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:38.210 --> 03:07:38.220 align:start position:0%
thing so we wanted to let you know like
 
03:07:40.429 --> 03:07:40.439 align:start position:0%
why they're being decided differently
 
03:07:40.439 --> 03:07:45.349 align:start position:0%
why they're being decided differently
here

03:07:45.349 --> 03:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:47.990 --> 03:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
all right so we I
 
03:07:50.450 --> 03:07:50.460 align:start position:0%
have to nude meeting that was my
 
03:07:52.130 --> 03:07:52.140 align:start position:0%
question if it was a consensus of the
 
03:07:56.030 --> 03:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
committee to cancel please let's so our
 
03:07:58.550 --> 03:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
next meeting will be July 20th which is
 
03:08:00.530 --> 03:08:00.540 align:start position:0%
a Thursday we're going to our summer
 
03:08:00.540 --> 03:08:01.730 align:start position:0%
a Thursday we're going to our summer
schedule

03:08:01.730 --> 03:08:01.740 align:start position:0%
schedule
 
03:08:04.790 --> 03:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
yes that's true okay
 
03:08:07.450 --> 03:08:07.460 align:start position:0%
anything else so you guys
 
03:08:12.050 --> 03:08:12.060 align:start position:0%
yes so for example if by if for some
 
03:08:14.510 --> 03:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
reason the gray wolf is put back onto
 
03:08:17.269 --> 03:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
the endangered species list then what
 
03:08:18.469 --> 03:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
would happen
 
03:08:21.070 --> 03:08:21.080 align:start position:0%
um then we would need to to reevaluate
 
03:08:24.290 --> 03:08:24.300 align:start position:0%
whether or not the fish and game rules
 
03:08:27.170 --> 03:08:27.180 align:start position:0%
would violate The Endangered Species Act
 
03:08:29.750 --> 03:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
and like I said with the Bobcats he
 
03:08:31.849 --> 03:08:31.859 align:start position:0%
didn't confirm that it would because no
 
03:08:34.969 --> 03:08:34.979 align:start position:0%
one had ever taken a lynx so
 
03:08:37.190 --> 03:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
um I did actually ask if anyone had ever
 
03:08:39.230 --> 03:08:39.240 align:start position:0%
taken a wolf and nobody brought me any
 
03:08:41.809 --> 03:08:41.819 align:start position:0%
evidence of that so we would have to
 
03:08:41.819 --> 03:08:43.210 align:start position:0%
evidence of that so we would have to
reevaluate

03:08:43.210 --> 03:08:43.220 align:start position:0%
reevaluate
 
03:08:46.070 --> 03:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
when the Bobcat rules were up the
 
03:08:49.490 --> 03:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
committee did enter an objection uh
 
03:08:51.769 --> 03:08:51.779 align:start position:0%
final objection based on the fact
 
03:08:53.870 --> 03:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
there's a potential violation of The
 
03:08:55.849 --> 03:08:55.859 align:start position:0%
Endangered Species Act
 
03:08:59.090 --> 03:08:59.100 align:start position:0%
but that was as Christina said links
 
03:09:02.510 --> 03:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
were endangered species and I believe
 
03:09:04.610 --> 03:09:04.620 align:start position:0%
that fish and game went ahead with their
 
03:09:07.130 --> 03:09:07.140 align:start position:0%
rule regardless of our objection we
 
03:09:08.389 --> 03:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
certainly didn't bring it to the house
 
03:09:11.330 --> 03:09:11.340 align:start position:0%
actually no they did not uh they
 
03:09:13.429 --> 03:09:13.439 align:start position:0%
withdrew the rule so there is no hunting
 
03:09:18.769 --> 03:09:18.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:18.779 --> 03:09:20.210 align:start position:0%
 
interesting

03:09:20.210 --> 03:09:20.220 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
03:09:27.349 --> 03:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:27.359 --> 03:09:29.899 align:start position:0%
 
okay
