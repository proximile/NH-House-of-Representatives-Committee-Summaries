okay good morning everyone and welcome
 
00:31:08.789 --> 00:31:08.799 align:start position:0%
to the stn subcommittee work session on
 
00:31:13.389 --> 00:31:13.399 align:start position:0%
House Bill 609 for this
 
00:31:16.909 --> 00:31:16.919 align:start position:0%
day which is October 24th I believe
 
00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:19.480 align:start position:0%
correct so we'll start our meeting as
 
00:31:21.549 --> 00:31:21.559 align:start position:0%
usual by asking everyone to rise and
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
Allegiance to the
 
00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
flag okay thank you I want to thank the
 
00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee members for um attendance
 
00:31:37.669 --> 00:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
today we have a full house and that's
 
00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:40.360 align:start position:0%
good to see this is our third
 
00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting on House Bill 609
 
00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:46.200 align:start position:0%
we've had extensive dis discussions
 
00:31:49.789 --> 00:31:49.799 align:start position:0%
about a proposed amendment and this
 
00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
morning I'm hopeful that we'll be able
 
00:31:56.190 --> 00:31:56.200 align:start position:0%
to reach final agreement on an amendment
 
00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
to hb6 9 that we can recommend to the
 
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
full committee all members of the
 
00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
subcommittee have had a copy of this
 
00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:10.200 align:start position:0%
draft Amendment since last Thursday
 
00:32:12.909 --> 00:32:12.919 align:start position:0%
afternoon and so they've had a chance to
 
00:32:14.629 --> 00:32:14.639 align:start position:0%
digest its
 
00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:17.960 align:start position:0%
contents uh and I'm looking for a
 
00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
comment about whether you think the
 
00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:23.320 align:start position:0%
draft we have working in front of us
 
00:32:26.669 --> 00:32:26.679 align:start position:0%
here today is adequate to its purpose
 
00:32:29.509 --> 00:32:29.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah I start with I thank you
 
00:32:34.389 --> 00:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I think it is
 
00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
adequate and I think people need to
 
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
remember that um this may not be perfect
 
00:32:40.669 --> 00:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
but it's a big step in the right
 
00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
direction I've attended a couple of
 
00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:44.600 align:start position:0%
meetings uh over the past few months
 
00:32:46.509 --> 00:32:46.519 align:start position:0%
specifically one up the FK meeting on
 
00:32:49.029 --> 00:32:49.039 align:start position:0%
the uh winter reliability program up in
 
00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
Maine this summer and got to talk to a
 
00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
lot of potential people that would be
 
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
building and right now New Hampshire
 
00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
does not have a great reputation uh
 
00:32:58.310 --> 00:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
because you know we had the Northern
 
00:32:59.789 --> 00:32:59.799 align:start position:0%
Pass whether you in favor of or not a
 
00:33:01.269 --> 00:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
lot of people see that as people being
 
00:33:03.149 --> 00:33:03.159 align:start position:0%
against new projects there was the
 
00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
latest wind project that took I don't
 
00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
know six years before it finally got
 
00:33:08.549 --> 00:33:08.559 align:start position:0%
licensed and that's a net of about 10
 
00:33:10.669 --> 00:33:10.679 align:start position:0%
megawatt so anything we can do to
 
00:33:12.269 --> 00:33:12.279 align:start position:0%
improve the process and show that we're
 
00:33:13.549 --> 00:33:13.559 align:start position:0%
trying to be a little bit more efficient
 
00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:16.600 align:start position:0%
I think will be received warmly by
 
00:33:18.669 --> 00:33:18.679 align:start position:0%
people that might be willing to invest
 
00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:20.360 align:start position:0%
whether it's transmission or energy
 
00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:22.120 align:start position:0%
projects in New Hampshire and you know
 
00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:24.200 align:start position:0%
if we're going to go forward with this
 
00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
electrification concept we're going to
 
00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:28.360 align:start position:0%
need more electricity and more
 
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
transmission to do it so something like
 
00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:32.360 align:start position:0%
this that it's like I say it may not be
 
00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
perfect but it's a big step in the right
 
00:33:35.629 --> 00:33:35.639 align:start position:0%
direction which I think we should
 
00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
take thank you for that comment I forgot
 
00:33:41.149 --> 00:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
to mention that the draft in front of us
 
00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
contains or reflects all of the comments
 
00:33:47.389 --> 00:33:47.399 align:start position:0%
and discussions that we had at our last
 
00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting so
 
00:33:52.389 --> 00:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
everything that we discussed there
 
00:33:55.549 --> 00:33:55.559 align:start position:0%
should have been reflected
 
00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
here some of the the comments may have
 
00:34:00.750 --> 00:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
been contrary to what's reflected here
 
00:34:04.669 --> 00:34:04.679 align:start position:0%
but we discussed them at the time so uh
 
00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm hopeful there's no surprises
 
00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
McGee those hopes be dashed no I'm just
 
00:34:16.669 --> 00:34:16.679 align:start position:0%
kidding um I I agree with uh
 
00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington that we you
 
00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
know we've been asked to do something to
 
00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:22.200 align:start position:0%
try and improve the site evaluation
 
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
committee process um we did receive
 
00:34:29.470 --> 00:34:29.480 align:start position:0%
input um even at the New Hampshire
 
00:34:31.349 --> 00:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
energy Summit from the panel that
 
00:34:34.589 --> 00:34:34.599 align:start position:0%
discussed the SEC that perhaps the
 
00:34:39.069 --> 00:34:39.079 align:start position:0%
process wasn't as broken as um the ways
 
00:34:42.109 --> 00:34:42.119 align:start position:0%
in which the site evaluation committee
 
00:34:44.349 --> 00:34:44.359 align:start position:0%
conducted hearings so we we did have
 
00:34:48.109 --> 00:34:48.119 align:start position:0%
input from folks who follow the process
 
00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
um asking us if there could be some
 
00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:52.040 align:start position:0%
changes made there and I think the only
 
00:34:54.869 --> 00:34:54.879 align:start position:0%
thing that we've changed here as of our
 
00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:57.720 align:start position:0%
last hearing that I would still question
 
00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:00.440 align:start position:0%
whether it's going to meet our goal is
 
00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
that we um we recanted our proposal to
 
00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
make uh the adjudicative proceeding of
 
00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
the sec's be something that the the
 
00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:13.640 align:start position:0%
named attorney on the Public Utilities
 
00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:15.560 align:start position:0%
Commission be the head of and we were
 
00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:17.320 align:start position:0%
dissuaded from that by folks who
 
00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
testified here but I I guess my question
 
00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
would be whether we just
 
00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:24.440 align:start position:0%
reconsider if that meets the purpose
 
00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
that we have uh in terms of trying to to
 
00:35:30.069 --> 00:35:30.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:32.200 align:start position:0%
process okay well we can have another
 
00:35:35.589 --> 00:35:35.599 align:start position:0%
discussion about that so the chair of
 
00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:37.480 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities
 
00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
Commission has been the chair of the
 
00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee since the site
 
00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:44.200 align:start position:0%
EV evaluation committee was formed back
 
00:35:45.589 --> 00:35:45.599 align:start position:0%
in the late
 
00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:49.720 align:start position:0%
1990s it's always been that the SEC
 
00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
chair was the Pu chair so we are
 
00:35:58.430 --> 00:35:58.440 align:start position:0%
retaining that structure here and uh
 
00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
I'd near need to hear a compelling
 
00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:03.720 align:start position:0%
reason why we would need to change that
 
00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:08.200 align:start position:0%
was that chair um always or only
 
00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes an attorney because I know
 
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
Diane Martin was an attorney and Martin
 
00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:13.640 align:start position:0%
hburg when his attorney was an attorney
 
00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
so Mike can answer it I guess yeah
 
00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
representative Harington the best to my
 
00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
knowledge the uh chair for the most of
 
00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:21.160 align:start position:0%
that time has always been an attorney
 
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:23.640 align:start position:0%
between Diane Martin and Tom getts was
 
00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
very long serving on there uh Amy Nati
 
00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh was involved and she was a lawyer as
 
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
well but the thing I think we need to
 
00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
remember here is that this is a small
 
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
part of the duties of the chair of the
 
00:36:37.309 --> 00:36:37.319 align:start position:0%
Pu as far as time they will have
 
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
multiple uh very formal hearings uh on
 
00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
weekly monthly basis over the course of
 
00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:46.280 align:start position:0%
a year where the Pu chair is going to be
 
00:36:50.309 --> 00:36:50.319 align:start position:0%
running the meeting and if he's if he or
 
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
she is good enough to do that it
 
00:36:53.710 --> 00:36:53.720 align:start position:0%
certainly I think it' be good enough to
 
00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
do a sec hearing maybe once or twice a
 
00:36:58.390 --> 00:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
year year so it's not like we're taking
 
00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
someone from a department that doesn't
 
00:37:02.829 --> 00:37:02.839 align:start position:0%
do adjudicative processes that's
 
00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
basically all the Pu does now is a
 
00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:07.400 align:start position:0%
judicate process so if they're qualified
 
00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:09.240 align:start position:0%
to be the chair of the Pu and do that on
 
00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
a daily basis they're certainly
 
00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
qualified to do it as far as chair of
 
00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
the SEC on a maybe two or three time a
 
00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:20.069 align:start position:0%
the SEC on a maybe two or three time a
year

00:37:20.069 --> 00:37:20.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:28.309 --> 00:37:28.319 align:start position:0%
question okay seeing none any further
 
00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
comments on the proposed uh
 
00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment all right I'd like to hear
 
00:37:37.109 --> 00:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
your uh thoughts about whether we as a
 
00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:39.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittee would be willing to vote to
 
00:37:41.589 --> 00:37:41.599 align:start position:0%
recommend to the full committee the
 
00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:47.240 align:start position:0%
amendment representative Corman thank
 
00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman yeah I I I feel like
 
00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:52.079 align:start position:0%
we've gone through this quite a bit uh
 
00:37:54.829 --> 00:37:54.839 align:start position:0%
it's as representative Harrington said
 
00:37:56.349 --> 00:37:56.359 align:start position:0%
I'm agreeing with him again it's not
 
00:37:57.829 --> 00:37:57.839 align:start position:0%
perfect perfect but it's it's a good
 
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
step in the right direction um and I am
 
00:38:03.069 --> 00:38:03.079 align:start position:0%
prepared to
 
00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
vote speaking of that representative
 
00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
Corman and Harrington agreeing with one
 
00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:12.440 align:start position:0%
another I think representative
 
00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:15.880 align:start position:0%
Harrington said after the meeting our
 
00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
last subcommittee meeting that the two
 
00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
of you agreeing with each other would
 
00:38:23.309 --> 00:38:23.319 align:start position:0%
probably mean that the Patriots would
 
00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
win the following weekend so we have
 
00:38:28.589 --> 00:38:28.599 align:start position:0%
another chance this week coming
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
up so that turned out to be a preent
 
00:38:35.069 --> 00:38:35.079 align:start position:0%
prediction on your part okay a further
 
00:38:37.349 --> 00:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
comment on whether we or not we should
 
00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:38.680 align:start position:0%
recommend to the full committee the
 
00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:39.880 align:start position:0%
adoption of this
 
00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:42.640 align:start position:0%
amendment representative
 
00:38:45.309 --> 00:38:45.319 align:start position:0%
Kaplan yeah I I agree with the uh the
 
00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
other Representatives on this
 
00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh that uh I'm ready to
 
00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
vote I think it does the purpose that we
 
00:38:54.309 --> 00:38:54.319 align:start position:0%
set out to uh to meet which is to
 
00:38:56.069 --> 00:38:56.079 align:start position:0%
streamline the process that does that
 
00:38:57.870 --> 00:38:57.880 align:start position:0%
and also Al at the same time safeguards
 
00:38:59.790 --> 00:38:59.800 align:start position:0%
the public interest I believe
 
00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
sufficiently and and uh as people as
 
00:39:04.069 --> 00:39:04.079 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington said uh the
 
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
proof will be in the pudding so uh no no
 
00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
no process is perfect but uh we need to
 
00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
let this vessel sail and see how it see
 
00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
how it
 
00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
does and I'll remind everybody on the
 
00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:18.040 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that even if we recommend
 
00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
this amendment to the full committee the
 
00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
full committee will still debate it and
 
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
decide its fate and if it should go
 
00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
forward to the Full House
 
00:39:29.109 --> 00:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
there'll be another debate there and
 
00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:31.400 align:start position:0%
then if it gets past the house it'll go
 
00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
to the Senate there'll be another debate
 
00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
there so there's plenty of other
 
00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:37.960 align:start position:0%
opportunities for further tweaks in this
 
00:39:40.829 --> 00:39:40.839 align:start position:0%
uh in this amendment well given the the
 
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:42.680 align:start position:0%
sense of the committee then I will make
 
00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
the motion that the
 
00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh recommend to the full St
 
00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
the adoption of the text of this
 
00:39:54.309 --> 00:39:54.319 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment I will submit this
 
00:39:59.109 --> 00:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
text to OLS later today and ask that it
 
00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
be formalized into an amendment and we
 
00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
will propose that to the full committee
 
00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:06.200 align:start position:0%
at exec session on
 
00:40:10.349 --> 00:40:10.359 align:start position:0%
