00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
open up the environment and agriculture
 
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 align:start position:0%
house committee this morning and we have
 
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 align:start position:0%
a special presentation from
 
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.309 align:start position:0%
a special presentation from
the

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
i lost my notes
 
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
there we are that's way at the top the
 
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
exotic aquatic weed and animal species
 
00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
committee so i'm going to turn it over
 
00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 align:start position:0%
to them for a presentation and uh my
 
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
understanding is we'll have a 15 or 20
 
00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 align:start position:0%
minute presentation some time for
 
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
questions is that correct
 
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
yes mr chair all right well thank you so
 
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh representative suzanne smith is going
 
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
to lead us in the presentation thank you
 
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
welcome to the e a thank you good to be
 
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
here again um i just wanted to say that
 
00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 align:start position:0%
the aquatic invasive weeds and species
 
00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:57.430 align:start position:0%
the aquatic invasive weeds and species
committee

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
is a permanent committee that was formed
 
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
quite a while ago 20 years ago and
 
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
originally it was pretty much milfoil
 
00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
that people talked about but now there
 
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
is a lot more happening and i'm joined
 
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
today by michelle davis michelle davis
 
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
from new hampshire lakes and also amy
 
00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
smagula from des who is our
 
00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
biggest expert in the state in my mind
 
00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 align:start position:0%
on aquatic invasives well welcome to all
 
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
of you look forward to your presentation
 
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.350 align:start position:0%
of you look forward to your presentation
great

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
great
 
00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 align:start position:0%
so basically the agenda for today is
 
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to talk about um what is
 
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
what is the threat of aquatic invasives
 
00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 align:start position:0%
and what are things that are being done
 
00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:41.110 align:start position:0%
and what are things that are being done
now

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
for those
 
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
and then what is the future outlook are
 
00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
we doing enough and more what more can
 
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
and a death the definition of invasive
 
00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 align:start position:0%
presentation so i'm kind of just i'm the
 
00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 align:start position:0%
what he called the vocal on the
 
00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.390 align:start position:0%
what he called the vocal on the
presentation

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
and they're non-native to the ecosystem
 
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
and the introduction causes or is likely
 
00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 align:start position:0%
to cause economic or environmental harm
 
00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
or harm to human health
 
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
and a lot of a lot of invasives come
 
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
into this country um in the ballast of
 
00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 align:start position:0%
large ships
 
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
and then they spread out across the
 
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.270 align:start position:0%
and then they spread out across the
country

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
um this is a map which is not super easy
 
00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 align:start position:0%
to see and it but mostly what you can
 
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
see all those dots all the different
 
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
colored dots are different invasives in
 
00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 align:start position:0%
different parts of the state and as you
 
00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
can see um there is a lot in the lakes
 
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
region along in the southern part of the
 
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
state and even over to the seacoast and
 
00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
really almost nothing up in the northern
 
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
tier of the state as far as invasives go
 
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
which is nice
 
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
but it has to do with the population and
 
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
how many people are going in and out
 
00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
with boats
 
00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
and we have a number of infested water
 
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 align:start position:0%
bodies in new hampshire
 
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
and even though you'll see milfoil is in
 
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.150 align:start position:0%
and even though you'll see milfoil is in
74

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
74
 
00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:08.479 align:start position:0%
water bodies and maybe
 
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
brittle niad is in only a few but there
 
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
can be two or three different species in
 
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.590 align:start position:0%
can be two or three different species in
one

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
uh water body
 
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
does that sound right michelle yeah
 
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
so the most threatening there are quite
 
00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
a few that are the most threatening ais
 
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire and the first is
 
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
milfoil which is i stated in the
 
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
beginning is
 
00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
is the most prolific in this state and
 
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
this is asquam marina at on squam lake
 
00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 align:start position:0%
and you can see there's a reflection of
 
00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:43.039 align:start position:0%
trees but if you look under the water
 
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
there is like solid plant life and that
 
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
is the milfoil that had taken over that
 
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.749 align:start position:0%
is the milfoil that had taken over that
area

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:49.759 align:start position:0%
area
 
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
and this is not a new picture
 
00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
so another um
 
00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 align:start position:0%
invasive species is the fan wart
 
00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:01.759 align:start position:0%
and that is newer than milfoil it wasn't
 
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
here probably 20 years ago i don't think
 
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
and then we have the water chestnut
 
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
that's the nashua river which was pretty
 
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
much covered with water chestnut and i
 
00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
believe that has mostly been taken care
 
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
of yes
 
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
that has been eradicated at this point
 
00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:25.039 align:start position:0%
and then we've also got the brittle niad
 
00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
european brittle naiad the reason it's
 
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
called brittle naiad is because little
 
00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:31.759 align:start position:0%
tiny pieces break off easily
 
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
and then start the spread of the
 
00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:38.479 align:start position:0%
uh invasive wherever it lands
 
00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
it also gets caught in like propellers
 
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
or you know it easily grabs on to other
 
00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
boats and stuff and then we have in the
 
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
animal section we you know this
 
00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
committee deals with
 
00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:53.919 align:start position:0%
uh aquatic invasive animal species but
 
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about fish we usually
 
00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
are just focusing on the non-vertebrates
 
00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
the invertebrates the the muscles um
 
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
zebra mussel which we don't have
 
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
actually very much of if any in new
 
00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
hampshire and then asian clams this is
 
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
the bottom of the merrimack river in
 
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
beau it's totally
 
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
i'm going to turn it over to michelle
 
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
for a bit
 
00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.469 align:start position:0%
for a bit
so

00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
not only are our
 
00:07:28.629 --> 00:07:28.639 align:start position:0%
invasive species unsightly and
 
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
unpleasant they can have really
 
00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.830 align:start position:0%
unpleasant they can have really
significant

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
significant
 
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
impacts on
 
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
recreation tourism and boating
 
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if you all have seen it but
 
00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.309 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if you all have seen it but
recently

00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
recently
 
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
dartmouth college released a study that
 
00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
that valued lake winnipesaukee at 17
 
00:07:48.309 --> 00:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
billion dollars um 300 million of that
 
00:07:51.189 --> 00:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
is tourism revenue 110 million of that
 
00:07:52.629 --> 00:07:52.639 align:start position:0%
approximately is boating and fishing
 
00:07:55.749 --> 00:07:55.759 align:start position:0%
revenue and 42 million of that is summer
 
00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
camp revenues so all of those industries
 
00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
could significantly be impacted by
 
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.710 align:start position:0%
could significantly be impacted by
aquatic

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
invasive species
 
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:07.430 align:start position:0%
invasive species
and

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
to my understanding lake sunapee is is
 
00:08:12.869 --> 00:08:12.879 align:start position:0%
being studied next and so
 
00:08:13.909 --> 00:08:13.919 align:start position:0%
we'll have
 
00:08:15.909 --> 00:08:15.919 align:start position:0%
and those are just two of our thousand
 
00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:18.160 align:start position:0%
lakes here in new hampshire
 
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.670 align:start position:0%
lakes here in new hampshire
um

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.589 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:08:21.589 --> 00:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:08:23.909 --> 00:08:23.919 align:start position:0%
so and then as far as you know other
 
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
other economic impacts property taxes
 
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:28.160 align:start position:0%
infestations can reduce property values
 
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
by 10 to 20 percent
 
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
you can imagine not wanting to buy a
 
00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.509 align:start position:0%
you can imagine not wanting to buy a
property

00:08:33.509 --> 00:08:33.519 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:08:33.519 --> 00:08:34.230 align:start position:0%
property
if

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:34.240 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:08:35.829 --> 00:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
off your dock looks like that and you
 
00:08:37.829 --> 00:08:37.839 align:start position:0%
can't swim and your boat propeller gets
 
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
caught every time you try to
 
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
try to leave
 
00:08:43.029 --> 00:08:43.039 align:start position:0%
that study indicated that property
 
00:08:44.949 --> 00:08:44.959 align:start position:0%
values on winnipesaukee
 
00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:47.519 align:start position:0%
are worth over 16 billion dollars so a
 
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
10 to 20 percent decrease in that
 
00:08:51.829 --> 00:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
property value on winnipesaki alone
 
00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:52.959 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:08:52.959 --> 00:08:55.590 align:start position:0%
would be
devastating

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
devastating
 
00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
and then you know so the outdoor
 
00:08:59.110 --> 00:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
recreation industry in new hampshire is
 
00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.389 align:start position:0%
recreation industry in new hampshire is
2.6

00:09:00.389 --> 00:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
2.6
 
00:09:00.399 --> 00:09:01.350 align:start position:0%
2.6
of

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
the state gdp um the last statistic i
 
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
saw and that's not just boating and
 
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
fishing but the last statistic i saw
 
00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
it's 26 000 jobs and 1.1 billion dollars
 
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
in wages annually
 
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.110 align:start position:0%
in wages annually
so

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
if new hampshire continues to have
 
00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
aquatic invasive species spread and we
 
00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
gain a reputation for being somewhere
 
00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
that's unpleasant to recreate
 
00:09:25.509 --> 00:09:25.519 align:start position:0%
you can see that that could have pretty
 
00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
significant impacts on our on our
 
00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.790 align:start position:0%
significant impacts on our on our
economy

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
these are some photos of
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
zebra mussels
 
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
and and other crustaceans and their
 
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
impacts the great lakes are are
 
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
struggling significantly with these
 
00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:42.790 align:start position:0%
struggling significantly with these
issues

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:09:44.949 --> 00:09:44.959 align:start position:0%
and so thinking about
 
00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
infrastructure impacts there's dam
 
00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
intake tower covered in in crustaceans
 
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:09:52.949 --> 00:09:52.959 align:start position:0%
we're we already have
 
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
infrastructure issues to be dealing with
 
00:09:56.949 --> 00:09:56.959 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire and then to add
 
00:09:59.350 --> 00:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
zebra mussels or something like that on
 
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
top of it
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
so the
 
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has a whole plan of how we
 
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
can deal with the threat of the aquatic
 
00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:15.839 align:start position:0%
invasives and it starts with prevention
 
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
which of course is the least expensive
 
00:10:21.509 --> 00:10:21.519 align:start position:0%
in most instances for any problem we
 
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
have prevention is the best medicine
 
00:10:27.509 --> 00:10:27.519 align:start position:0%
then we have early detection so the you
 
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
know if you see a piece of milfoil
 
00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
growing in your
 
00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.389 align:start position:0%
growing in your
neighborhood

00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
neighborhood
 
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
in your local lake and there has never
 
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
been any before and you report it it can
 
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
usually be taken care of fairly easily
 
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
and then rapid response is the next key
 
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
thing you know if you respond quickly
 
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
you can deal with these problems more
 
00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.269 align:start position:0%
you can deal with these problems more
easily

00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
easily
 
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
and then there is treatment and control
 
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
which the price goes up on that and then
 
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh and that can encompass a lot of
 
00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:02.470 align:start position:0%
uh and that can encompass a lot of
questions

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
here and then long-term management is
 
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
the most expensive and that is like over
 
00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
the years a a community a lake
 
00:11:12.829 --> 00:11:12.839 align:start position:0%
association dealing with
 
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
that and so prevention and early
 
00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.590 align:start position:0%
that and so prevention and early
detection

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
detection
 
00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.590 align:start position:0%
detection
michelle

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
michelle
 
00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.550 align:start position:0%
michelle
so

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:22.949 --> 00:11:22.959 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire lakes
 
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
facilitates the lake host program that
 
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
you may be familiar with
 
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
people in blue shirts at boat launches
 
00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:30.550 align:start position:0%
people in blue shirts at boat launches
um

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
who are checking boats that are entering
 
00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
and leaving water bodies for aquatic
 
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
invasive species
 
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
we've been the the program's been in in
 
00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
existence for 20 years
 
00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:42.640 align:start position:0%
this year
 
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
we're anticipating about 80 groups
 
00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
um with
 
00:11:50.069 --> 00:11:50.079 align:start position:0%
700 paid and volunteer lake hosts
 
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
we're covering 80 ram 80 lakes and 100
 
00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
ramps and last year we conducted
 
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
about 80 000 inspections and of those 80
 
00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
000 inspections 15 of them
 
00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
um were resulted in saves which is
 
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:08.240 align:start position:0%
specimens prevented from entering a
 
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
water body
 
00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:11.519 align:start position:0%
and several of which
 
00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
several of which of those saves were on
 
00:12:15.269 --> 00:12:15.279 align:start position:0%
uninfested currently uninfested water
 
00:12:15.279 --> 00:12:16.629 align:start position:0%
uninfested currently uninfested water
bodies

00:12:16.629 --> 00:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
bodies
 
00:12:16.639 --> 00:12:17.750 align:start position:0%
bodies
so

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:20.240 align:start position:0%
and then weed watchers and river runners
 
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
are those those early detection
 
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
volunteers they monitor lakes and ponds
 
00:12:29.829 --> 00:12:29.839 align:start position:0%
for ais and so people are are
 
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:33.200 align:start position:0%
paddling the the
 
00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:35.200 align:start position:0%
the shallow areas of the lakes that you
 
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
can see the bottom to to monitor for um
 
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
suspicious specimens and then they're
 
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
they're taking samples of those and
 
00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
bringing them to des for identification
 
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
um and then on the legislative side of
 
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
things um it's uh under current state
 
00:12:52.949 --> 00:12:52.959 align:start position:0%
law any boat used in
 
00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:54.959 align:start position:0%
new hampshire should have been cleaned
 
00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
and drained before arriving at the next
 
00:12:59.590 --> 00:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
water body and there's rules against
 
00:13:03.509 --> 00:13:03.519 align:start position:0%
transporting any exotic plants
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
to or from new hampshire waters there is
 
00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
also since 2019 we've had a best
 
00:13:10.629 --> 00:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
available tech law that says that
 
00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
boaters must use the best technology
 
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:14.240 align:start position:0%
available to them
 
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
as long as it's free and available when
 
00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:16.629 align:start position:0%
as long as it's free and available when
they're

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
entering or leaving a water body
 
00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
so that best tech can look like a number
 
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
of different things it could be a garden
 
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
hose it could be
 
00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
some tongs to remove
 
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
specimens or it can be as robust as that
 
00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
the cd3 unit that you see there in the
 
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
center it's new hampshire lakes has a
 
00:13:39.509 --> 00:13:39.519 align:start position:0%
mobile solar powered
 
00:13:39.519 --> 00:13:40.710 align:start position:0%
mobile solar powered
waterless

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:40.720 align:start position:0%
waterless
 
00:13:43.269 --> 00:13:43.279 align:start position:0%
boat cleaning station there's a vacuum
 
00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
there's pressurized air to help dry the
 
00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:46.790 align:start position:0%
there's pressurized air to help dry the
boat

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
boat
 
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
and then there's some brushes and um
 
00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.030 align:start position:0%
and then there's some brushes and um
and

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
the the technical term for them is reach
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
grabbers but they're giant tongs that
 
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
you can pull specimens off your boat
 
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:56.870 align:start position:0%
you can pull specimens off your boat
with

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
and so the goal of that program
 
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
ultimately is to
 
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
inspire and encourage
 
00:14:05.269 --> 00:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
communities to install permanent
 
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
fixtures the cd3 units come in a number
 
00:14:10.389 --> 00:14:10.399 align:start position:0%
of different sizes and
 
00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:14.720 align:start position:0%
and levels of technology but
 
00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
so we're working on our deployment plan
 
00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.519 align:start position:0%
for this year but we're partnering with
 
00:14:19.509 --> 00:14:19.519 align:start position:0%
marinas and state agencies as well as
 
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
local lake associations and and towns
 
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
to um just
 
00:14:27.189 --> 00:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
increase the awareness and education of
 
00:14:33.509 --> 00:14:33.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:35.829 --> 00:14:35.839 align:start position:0%
so the rat when we get into the rapid
 
00:14:38.949 --> 00:14:38.959 align:start position:0%
response and treatment and control
 
00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.030 align:start position:0%
we have
the

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:42.959 align:start position:0%
different lake associations will work
 
00:14:45.189 --> 00:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
with des and there will be divers that
 
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
dive down and there is a diver assisted
 
00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.829 align:start position:0%
dive down and there is a diver assisted
suction

00:14:49.829 --> 00:14:49.839 align:start position:0%
suction
 
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
diver assisted suction
 
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
program and i know that i we went on a
 
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
field trip a few years ago and at squam
 
00:14:59.910 --> 00:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
lake and there was a boat and we were
 
00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:03.279 align:start position:0%
all on the boat and under us were divers
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
and they had like a vacuum thing
 
00:15:08.949 --> 00:15:08.959 align:start position:0%
and they would like find the invasives
 
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
pull them up by the root put them in the
 
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
vacuum and then they would come up on
 
00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
the boat and then get sorted so if
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
anything got on there that wasn't an
 
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
invasive like a crawfish or something
 
00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
like that they could throw it back in
 
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
the water but any of the invasives that
 
00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
were coming up were then out of the
 
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
water system so that's a way because a
 
00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
lot of times just uh
 
00:15:31.749 --> 00:15:31.759 align:start position:0%
you're in water that's a little deeper
 
00:15:33.269 --> 00:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
than you want to be in and if it's a
 
00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:35.519 align:start position:0%
large infestation that can be very
 
00:15:35.519 --> 00:15:36.550 align:start position:0%
large infestation that can be very
helpful

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
it's hand pulling and then diver
 
00:15:40.949 --> 00:15:40.959 align:start position:0%
assisted uh that there's also something
 
00:15:43.269 --> 00:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
called a benthic barrier which is
 
00:15:45.269 --> 00:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
something that if you have a lake level
 
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
that it's uh the lake level is lowered
 
00:15:49.829 --> 00:15:49.839 align:start position:0%
in the fall
 
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
and so you put this barrier down
 
00:15:54.389 --> 00:15:54.399 align:start position:0%
and then leave it there so then the next
 
00:15:57.189 --> 00:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
year nothing can grow there
 
00:15:59.749 --> 00:15:59.759 align:start position:0%
and that is sometimes effective and then
 
00:16:02.389 --> 00:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
the last course of action would be
 
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
herbicide application and that is done
 
00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:08.959 align:start position:0%
under the supervision of des and
 
00:16:10.389 --> 00:16:10.399 align:start position:0%
department of agriculture which
 
00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
regulates herbicides and pesticides
 
00:16:15.749 --> 00:16:15.759 align:start position:0%
unfortunately matt dosiack who's our
 
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
member on the
 
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
aquatic invasives committee couldn't be
 
00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:21.839 align:start position:0%
here today but i'm sure that amy smagula
 
00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
could answer any questions about the
 
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
herbicides which i know is under the
 
00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:31.189 --> 00:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
and then long-term management
 
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
this is a huge program
 
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:34.550 align:start position:0%
this is a huge program
for

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:16:37.269 --> 00:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
areas and lakes and small lakes that are
 
00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
impacted and they a lot of them will
 
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
have a lake association for their small
 
00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
lake or
 
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
whatever and then
 
00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
they will work with des
 
00:16:50.629 --> 00:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
to try to mitigate what they can do
 
00:16:53.189 --> 00:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
to problem solve and
 
00:16:53.199 --> 00:16:54.310 align:start position:0%
to problem solve and
uh

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:16:59.430 --> 00:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
and the uh we were the
 
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
on on the invasives
 
00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
aquatic invasive species committee
 
00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:11.039 align:start position:0%
des is represented and des does a large
 
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
part of the work here
 
00:17:14.949 --> 00:17:14.959 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
with aquatic invasives
 
00:17:19.029 --> 00:17:19.039 align:start position:0%
and their the
 
00:17:21.309 --> 00:17:21.319 align:start position:0%
program which provides grants to
 
00:17:23.669 --> 00:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
municipalities and also
 
00:17:25.029 --> 00:17:25.039 align:start position:0%
pays for
 
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
some of the remediation things that are
 
00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:28.470 align:start position:0%
some of the remediation things that are
happening

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
happening
 
00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
is paid funded by boat registration fees
 
00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
and recently the general fund and then
 
00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:36.559 align:start position:0%
we have a new decal which will raise
 
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
money for this program also
 
00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
and then as i said department of
 
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
agriculture markets and food division of
 
00:17:44.789 --> 00:17:44.799 align:start position:0%
pesticide control
 
00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
manages for herbicide treatments
 
00:17:51.669 --> 00:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
and they uh matt is like works part time
 
00:17:53.669 --> 00:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
doing this as part of his
 
00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
job there
 
00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
and then the fish and game department
 
00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
fishing it's interesting because
 
00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
although des handles aquatic invasive
 
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
plants fish and game is responsible for
 
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
animals which has to do with spiny water
 
00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:07.990 align:start position:0%
animals which has to do with spiny water
flea

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
flea
 
00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
and the asian clam and any other
 
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.350 align:start position:0%
and the asian clam and any other
invertebrates

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
invertebrates
 
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
and so they are represented director
 
00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
mason is on the committee on this
 
00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.190 align:start position:0%
mason is on the committee on this
committee

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:18.070 align:start position:0%
committee
and

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
they we are working all together trying
 
00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
to better coordinate this animal species
 
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
was only added to the committee in the
 
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
last 10 years
 
00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
so this has been
 
00:18:31.029 --> 00:18:31.039 align:start position:0%
an interesting uh transition and we're
 
00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
all learning a lot
 
00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
and the committee was established in
 
00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.909 align:start position:0%
and the committee was established in
2004

00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:37.919 align:start position:0%
2004
 
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
and as i said this so
 
00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
we educate legislators because next year
 
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
we may come to you for money or next
 
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
year we may come to you for a new plan
 
00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
or editing so it's nice to uh educate
 
00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:53.039 align:start position:0%
people to the situation and so many of
 
00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
us live near a lake or visit our lakes
 
00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
and ponds and rivers
 
00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.029 align:start position:0%
and ponds and rivers
so

00:18:59.029 --> 00:18:59.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:59.039 --> 00:18:59.830 align:start position:0%
so
we

00:18:59.830 --> 00:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:07.029 --> 00:19:07.039 align:start position:0%
and then here's a explanation of the
 
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
funding and how this is grown from boat
 
00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:11.350 align:start position:0%
funding and how this is grown from boat
registration

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
registration
 
00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
and interesting you know some people
 
00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:15.039 align:start position:0%
might say
 
00:19:17.909 --> 00:19:17.919 align:start position:0%
we have an annual registration of 92
 
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
over 90 000 boats every year that are
 
00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
registered in new hampshire and some
 
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
people may say why do we keep raising
 
00:19:26.549 --> 00:19:26.559 align:start position:0%
the boat registrations but when we work
 
00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
with marine trades and other
 
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
organizations they're like happy to have
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
the increase in registration fees rather
 
00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
than any other
 
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
change in
 
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
monies that are
 
00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
asked for and that's something that they
 
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
and other funding uh as i said about
 
00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.270 align:start position:0%
i don't know
2019

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
2019
 
00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
was it yeah 2019 uh 400 000 over two
 
00:19:58.150 --> 00:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
years was allocated for the aquatic
 
00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
invasive species
 
00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:02.149 align:start position:0%
invasive species
work

00:20:02.149 --> 00:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:05.039 align:start position:0%
and then we have the decals
 
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
that just was started and that is just
 
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
being implemented last year was the
 
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
first year
 
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
and then there are private donations and
 
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
municipal funds
 
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
and a lot of that is when for small lake
 
00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.950 align:start position:0%
and a lot of that is when for small lake
associations

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
associations
 
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
like squam lake association the sunrise
 
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
lake association and they work with des
 
00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
and then the people
 
00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
pay some of the money too
 
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
and here's expenditures just to give you
 
00:20:35.029 --> 00:20:35.039 align:start position:0%
a quick thing if you can see it the
 
00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
purple is what this the grants that the
 
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
state gives to the different
 
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities and lakes
 
00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
and then the local contributions are the
 
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
whites you can see the state is a very
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
small part of the funding
 
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
and most of it is coming from
 
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
the public
 
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
who love their lakes
 
00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
and then this is a
 
00:20:57.669 --> 00:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
how much was asked for and how much was
 
00:20:59.669 --> 00:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
given to grants
 
00:21:01.029 --> 00:21:01.039 align:start position:0%
over the last
 
00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
and then here's a a quick overview of
 
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
the funding and where it comes from and
 
00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
as you can see 35 percent is private
 
00:21:14.159 --> 00:21:15.470 align:start position:0%
as you can see 35 percent is private
money

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
and this was a study put up by the
 
00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
ossipee lake alliance
 
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
and so the threat is serious and
 
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
economic impacts recreational impacts
 
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
and if it was uncontrolled it could
 
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
devastate our tourism economy
 
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
and most of the activities are paid for
 
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
by boaters municipalities governments
 
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
and donations
 
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
and here's remember i showed you that
 
00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
picture of asquam cove on the left with
 
00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
all the plants and then as it is now you
 
00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:05.669 --> 00:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
much nicer place to put your boat in not
 
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
have milfoil getting wrapped up in the
 
00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.070 align:start position:0%
have milfoil getting wrapped up in the
propeller

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
propeller
 
00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
and here are the members of the
 
00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:12.470 align:start position:0%
and here are the members of the
committee

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
and now you can see it you know we have
 
00:22:21.909 --> 00:22:21.919 align:start position:0%
people from all different uh agencies
 
00:22:24.149 --> 00:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
and then different companies and
 
00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
also public members
 
00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
and that is the end of the slide show
 
00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
and we would love to hear
 
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
if anyone has any questions
 
00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
well thank you we appreciate that i'll
 
00:22:40.149 --> 00:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
start one off i guess so the the state
 
00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
voting registration fees or the voting
 
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
registration fees which bucket to those
 
00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:46.480 align:start position:0%
go in the state or the municipal bucket
 
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
i'm going to uh
 
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
have amy address all those kind of
 
00:22:55.029 --> 00:22:55.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:56.789 --> 00:22:56.799 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman for the record my
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
name is amy smagula and i'm a biologist
 
00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
with the department of environmental
 
00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:01.510 align:start position:0%
with the department of environmental
services

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:02.870 align:start position:0%
services
uh

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
and these are the folks who give the
 
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
presentation for the committee but i'm
 
00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
glad to answer the questions so the vote
 
00:23:11.669 --> 00:23:11.679 align:start position:0%
registration fees are
 
00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
there are multiple fees within the vote
 
00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:14.870 align:start position:0%
there are multiple fees within the vote
registration

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
registration
 
00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:15.990 align:start position:0%
registration
fee

00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
fee
 
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
and the money is directed to the
 
00:23:20.549 --> 00:23:20.559 align:start position:0%
department of department of safety who
 
00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
collects the fees and they transfer them
 
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
to def so it's kind of a
 
00:23:26.149 --> 00:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
meandering path but ultimately the
 
00:23:28.149 --> 00:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
funding comes directly to us
 
00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
so is that counted in the the state
 
00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:31.919 align:start position:0%
portion or the municipal contribution
 
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
portion that would be the state portion
 
00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
and about three quarters of the state
 
00:23:38.549 --> 00:23:38.559 align:start position:0%
portion goes right back out as grants to
 
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
other entities and then they come up
 
00:23:42.149 --> 00:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
with other local match
 
00:23:42.159 --> 00:23:43.190 align:start position:0%
with other local match
great

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
great
 
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
all right i'll open it up look so we've
 
00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
got multiple i'll start with the
 
00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:47.919 align:start position:0%
representative aaron thank you and good
 
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
morning that was a wonderful
 
00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
presentation by the way and i appreciate
 
00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
you coming in to do this
 
00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
i'm interested to know and
 
00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:57.350 align:start position:0%
i'm interested to know and
other

00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:23:59.269 --> 00:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
invasive species do you include also
 
00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
yellow iris the yellow yeah yeah you are
 
00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
correct we do include that one as a
 
00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
state-listed invasive and how pervasive
 
00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:08.480 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
it's scattered around the state we've
 
00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
mostly noticed it in southern portions
 
00:24:14.549 --> 00:24:14.559 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire along riverways so
 
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
there are where where it is there are
 
00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
locally large stands of it but it's not
 
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
extremely widespread across the state
 
00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:22.470 align:start position:0%
extremely widespread across the state
yet

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
yet
 
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
representative comptoin
 
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:24:30.149 --> 00:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
my town
 
00:24:33.269 --> 00:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
every year since i can remember for the
 
00:24:35.909 --> 00:24:35.919 align:start position:0%
last 20 years has
 
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
voted to
 
00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
fund milfoil
 
00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:39.810 align:start position:0%
fund milfoil
um

00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:39.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:41.110 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:24:43.029 --> 00:24:43.039 align:start position:0%
divers and
 
00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
excavation in our town we have a town
 
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
with over five bodies of water
 
00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919 align:start position:0%
we have seen a decrease in that through
 
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
the contin the annual
 
00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:54.310 align:start position:0%
the contin the annual
um

00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:55.909 --> 00:24:55.919 align:start position:0%
upkeep with that
 
00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering how many other towns and
 
00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:02.149 align:start position:0%
 
to

00:25:02.149 --> 00:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
to the treatment of their water
 
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
and if you're seeing an improvement and
 
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
if they're doing it on a yearly basis
 
00:25:10.149 --> 00:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a great question so
 
00:25:13.669 --> 00:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
right now we have about 50 to 60
 
00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
different towns and
 
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
towns and league associations that
 
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
contribute annually for control actions
 
00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
and we have seen that the rate of spread
 
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
has gone down as a result of the
 
00:25:27.269 --> 00:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
prevention efforts and the management
 
00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
efforts have been successful in reducing
 
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
go ahead and follow it yes thank you
 
00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
the other municipalities and towns that
 
00:25:43.029 --> 00:25:43.039 align:start position:0%
don't contribute any funds
 
00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
um is the state then
 
00:25:48.149 --> 00:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
being the the sole resource for
 
00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
controlling milfoil or any other
 
00:25:51.669 --> 00:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
aquatics invasive species in those
 
00:25:54.149 --> 00:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
waterways no unfortunately if there's no
 
00:25:56.149 --> 00:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
local match we are not able to award
 
00:25:58.149 --> 00:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
grants to local entities
 
00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
so the first time a new infestation is
 
00:26:02.149 --> 00:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
documented we can pay a hundred percent
 
00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
of the control
 
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
after that we need match funds so for
 
00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
perspective it took about five million
 
00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
dollars last year to control invasive
 
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
aquatic plants in about 50 water bodies
 
00:26:13.669 --> 00:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
this year it will be about six million
 
00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
dollars and des is able to offer 50
 
00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.430 align:start position:0%
dollars and des is able to offer 50
grants

00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
grants
 
00:26:19.269 --> 00:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
we just don't have the money to cover
 
00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
six million dollars worth of control
 
00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
efforts on ourselves and as you remember
 
00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:25.039 align:start position:0%
in the presentation
 
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
there were 91 water bodies that are
 
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
infested so we're only managing just
 
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
thank you just one more follow-up
 
00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:34.950 align:start position:0%
thank you just one more follow-up
question

00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
so those municipalities
 
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
um or towns that don't invest in their
 
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
water uh ways
 
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
are basically ignoring the tourism value
 
00:26:49.029 --> 00:26:49.039 align:start position:0%
uh to their towns
 
00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:51.039 align:start position:0%
what how do we get them to start
 
00:26:51.039 --> 00:26:52.710 align:start position:0%
what how do we get them to start
investing

00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
investing
 
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
what is what is it through education of
 
00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
the public um and how do we do that and
 
00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
how do we create an outreach for them
 
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a great question i i think
 
00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
continued um exploration of other
 
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
options too so a lot of those water
 
00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
bodies are either river systems that go
 
00:27:11.669 --> 00:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
through many towns or they're very small
 
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
lakes that don't have an established
 
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
lake association to be direct advocates
 
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
for those water bodies so for the larger
 
00:27:21.029 --> 00:27:21.039 align:start position:0%
systems where there are multiple towns
 
00:27:21.039 --> 00:27:22.070 align:start position:0%
systems where there are multiple towns
involved

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
involved
 
00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's sometimes hard to get all of that
 
00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
involvement across a river course
 
00:27:27.909 --> 00:27:27.919 align:start position:0%
because once it's in a different town it
 
00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
it's hard to piece it together um and
 
00:27:32.389 --> 00:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
then for the smaller leak associations
 
00:27:34.389 --> 00:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
that's challenging because there's not
 
00:27:36.149 --> 00:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
somebody to lead the charge locally to
 
00:27:37.269 --> 00:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
ask for
 
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
a conservation commission
 
00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
allocation or a warrant article or
 
00:27:42.789 --> 00:27:42.799 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
so i'm happy to continue reaching out to
 
00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
those groups but unless there's a local
 
00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
entity that's engaged it's very hard to
 
00:27:53.269 --> 00:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
keep momentum going
 
00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
representative murray
 
00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question so one of
 
00:27:58.950 --> 00:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
the questions i did have was around
 
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
those smaller lake associations do they
 
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
then network with regional lake
 
00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
associations or do you see anything that
 
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
kind of helps
 
00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
connect those folks together if they are
 
00:28:13.269 --> 00:28:13.279 align:start position:0%
smaller to advocate together
 
00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
i have not seen the smaller leaks
 
00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
network as much there just isn't a lot
 
00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
going on on those systems they sort of
 
00:28:24.549 --> 00:28:24.559 align:start position:0%
don't have a lot of volunteer efforts
 
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
going on for weed watching
 
00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
they don't have
 
00:28:30.789 --> 00:28:30.799 align:start position:0%
even a lake association in place to
 
00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
collect dues or to bring people together
 
00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
it's sort of every person for themselves
 
00:28:37.669 --> 00:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
on those types of lakes and that's hard
 
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
because you really do need people
 
00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
rallying around that issue so it's
 
00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:45.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you and then so if if one of these
 
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
smaller lakes were to discover that
 
00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
there were an issue
 
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
um they would simply then have to know
 
00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
where to go or who to reach out to
 
00:28:58.630 --> 00:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
if there is a problem and you had
 
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
indicated the first instance is 100
 
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
covered and then after that
 
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
50 this year
 
00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
yep okay so um
 
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
that's a great resource to know that is
 
00:29:13.029 --> 00:29:13.039 align:start position:0%
available out there and i guess um
 
00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
it's really encouraging to me to at
 
00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
least know that there's something there
 
00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:17.750 align:start position:0%
least know that there's something there
that

00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
that knowledge can then be shared among
 
00:29:21.909 --> 00:29:21.919 align:start position:0%
the smaller networks so thank you yeah
 
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes um what happens is that if
 
00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
people find something and they don't
 
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
know where to go with it they'll start
 
00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:27.590 align:start position:0%
know where to go with it they'll start
with

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:30.640 align:start position:0%
you know uh unh or they'll start with a
 
00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
different state agency and then it
 
00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
eventually comes to me and once i
 
00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
identify it it's just it's the tangled
 
00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
pathway to finding the answer to a
 
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
question i think that we've all gone
 
00:29:41.909 --> 00:29:41.919 align:start position:0%
through but once they get there i'm glad
 
00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
to help them through the process it's
 
00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:47.039 align:start position:0%
just yeah it's finding the right path
 
00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:51.269 --> 00:29:51.279 align:start position:0%
hi there thank you so much for that
 
00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
presentation that was actually very
 
00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
informative uh the question i had was do
 
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
discount sheet or something that we
 
00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
could provide
 
00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
to our uh our towns that can at least
 
00:30:10.789 --> 00:30:10.799 align:start position:0%
give them some give some information on
 
00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
the matching funds and things for them
 
00:30:14.549 --> 00:30:14.559 align:start position:0%
to consider of course yeah we do have a
 
00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
lot of resources on our website but we
 
00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
also have
 
00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
little fact sheets and and card stock
 
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
material that conveys the message of if
 
00:30:24.789 --> 00:30:24.799 align:start position:0%
you find something reported and then we
 
00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
will work with you to help you get
 
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
through the process
 
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
so i can i can send some to the
 
00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:31.110 align:start position:0%
so i can i can send some to the
committee

00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
um on your website you have information
 
00:30:35.909 --> 00:30:35.919 align:start position:0%
on the matching funds and grants right
 
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
so if somebody was referred there they
 
00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
could find that all that right there
 
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
okay absolutely thank you it's on the
 
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services
 
00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:48.389 --> 00:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
go ahead rip tutsi um
 
00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
um nashua just opened up i think it was
 
00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
last year the year before a new boat
 
00:30:59.029 --> 00:30:59.039 align:start position:0%
ramp on the
 
00:31:00.389 --> 00:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
merrimack river
 
00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
um has new hampshire lakes been in touch
 
00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
with the merrimack river
 
00:31:09.669 --> 00:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
what is it the lakes association yeah
 
00:31:11.509 --> 00:31:11.519 align:start position:0%
right right exactly
 
00:31:14.149 --> 00:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
to do anything in terms of educating
 
00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
voters or
 
00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
setting up your
 
00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:19.029 align:start position:0%
setting up your
educational

00:31:19.029 --> 00:31:19.039 align:start position:0%
educational
 
00:31:19.039 --> 00:31:20.710 align:start position:0%
educational
um

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
um yeah i don't i don't know the answer
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
to that new hampshire lakes is focused
 
00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.230 align:start position:0%
to that new hampshire lakes is focused
on

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
on lakes in new hampshire if um if there
 
00:31:30.389 --> 00:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
were another local group like merrimack
 
00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
river watershed council
 
00:31:35.509 --> 00:31:35.519 align:start position:0%
we would certainly partner with them or
 
00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
and help share information but our
 
00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
funding and our resources go primarily
 
00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
to lakes
 
00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:51.669 --> 00:31:51.679 align:start position:0%
you got to turn your mic on
 
00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
there you go that's on
 
00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:54.549 align:start position:0%
there you go that's on
okay

00:31:54.549 --> 00:31:54.559 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
um invasive species are they affected by
 
00:31:59.110 --> 00:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
water temperature like will they
 
00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:00.389 align:start position:0%
water temperature like will they
uh

00:32:00.389 --> 00:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:03.669 --> 00:32:03.679 align:start position:0%
grow more if the water's warm or
 
00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
yeah definitely so warmer water makes
 
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
for a faster growth rate and some of the
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
scary statistics that we've seen of some
 
00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
of the plants milfoil will grow an inch
 
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
a day
 
00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
in the summer months when the water
 
00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
temperatures are in the 70s
 
00:32:19.029 --> 00:32:19.039 align:start position:0%
other plants that we don't have yet that
 
00:32:21.029 --> 00:32:21.039 align:start position:0%
we that we really don't want is one of
 
00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
them's hydrilla that grows six inches a
 
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
day so the growth is rapid and it is
 
00:32:28.549 --> 00:32:28.559 align:start position:0%
accelerated by warmer water temperature
 
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
and on top of that as our water's warm
 
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
we will have other species from down
 
00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
south which are even more potentially
 
00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.389 align:start position:0%
south which are even more potentially
invasive

00:32:36.389 --> 00:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
invasive
 
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
come our way and
 
00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:40.559 align:start position:0%
add to our list of infestations most
 
00:32:40.559 --> 00:32:41.509 align:start position:0%
add to our list of infestations most
likely

00:32:41.509 --> 00:32:41.519 align:start position:0%
likely
 
00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
all right well i don't see any further
 
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
questions but i again want to thank all
 
00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
of you that was a very informative
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
presentation and we appreciate you

stuff you know information that we need
or

00:33:17.669 --> 00:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:19.360 align:start position:0%

been great to be here great thank you
 
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
so we'll be uh
 
00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
in recess until 10 a.m we will take up
 
00:33:31.909 --> 00:33:31.919 align:start position:0%
our first hearing which is senate bill
 
00:33:31.919 --> 00:59:27.270 align:start position:0%
our first hearing which is senate bill
267

00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:29.349 --> 00:59:29.359 align:start position:0%
every fall they cut it down and it grows
 
00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
right up thick and like between rides
 
00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
and stuff
 
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
gives like a privacy
 
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:37.109 align:start position:0%
gives like a privacy
yeah

00:59:37.109 --> 00:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
the only place i've seen it any good
 
00:59:50.230 --> 00:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:25.030 --> 01:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:51.670 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:18.870 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
all right good morning everyone it is uh
 
01:01:23.349 --> 01:01:23.359 align:start position:0%
1001 and i

want to welcome you back to the
 
01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
environment and agricultural committee
 
01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to open up the hearing on
 
01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:33.200 align:start position:0%
senate bill 267 and i'm going to call on
 
01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:34.390 align:start position:0%
senate bill 267 and i'm going to call on
senator

01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
senator
 
01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
guida to introduce the bill
 
01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
welcome senator dna thank you mr
 
01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee for
 
01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
the record bob guidas senate district 2
 
01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:46.559 align:start position:0%
and prime sponsor of senate bill 267 fna
 
01:01:48.549 --> 01:01:48.559 align:start position:0%
as you travel around the state
 
01:01:51.270 --> 01:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh you will begin to notice entire areas
 
01:01:53.190 --> 01:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
of forestry that are dying and you'll
 
01:01:55.270 --> 01:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
notice japanese knotweed that's invading
 
01:01:57.510 --> 01:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
our our streets our communities and so
 
01:01:59.670 --> 01:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
forth those are but two of the numbers
 
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
of invasive upland species
 
01:02:03.270 --> 01:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh that are
 
01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
literally uh taking over much of our our
 
01:02:07.829 --> 01:02:07.839 align:start position:0%
forests and our and our meadows and so
 
01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
forth so
 
01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh the origin of this bill uh was that
 
01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
very uh that very problem we have no
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
coordinated statewide approach to deal
 
01:02:16.319 --> 01:02:17.109 align:start position:0%
coordinated statewide approach to deal
with

01:02:17.109 --> 01:02:17.119 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh upland invasive species
 
01:02:20.950 --> 01:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
unlike the water side of the house in
 
01:02:22.630 --> 01:02:22.640 align:start position:0%
which aquatic invasive species are very
 
01:02:25.029 --> 01:02:25.039 align:start position:0%
carefully monitored by des and and they
 
01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
have a program and it's well established
 
01:02:28.390 --> 01:02:28.400 align:start position:0%
and funded
 
01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
so in the interests of protecting our
 
01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
forests protecting our landowners and
 
01:02:35.829 --> 01:02:35.839 align:start position:0%
our private property as well i brought
 
01:02:38.549 --> 01:02:38.559 align:start position:0%
forth 267 fna
 
01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:40.640 align:start position:0%
and does three things
 
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
it sets uh up a position of upland
 
01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
invasive species program coordinator in
 
01:02:46.710 --> 01:02:46.720 align:start position:0%
the department of agriculture's markets
 
01:02:47.910 --> 01:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
and foods and i worked with the
 
01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner on developing this
 
01:02:51.990 --> 01:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:02:54.390 --> 01:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
is not a permanent fix it's intended to
 
01:02:56.549 --> 01:02:56.559 align:start position:0%
get us into the next budget cycle
 
01:02:58.309 --> 01:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
at which point we would anticipate a new
 
01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
position being established to coordinate
 
01:03:02.230 --> 01:03:02.240 align:start position:0%
this for the state this bill gets it
 
01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
started gets things you get some
 
01:03:04.870 --> 01:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
equipment in
 
01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh perhaps a location so forth and so
 
01:03:08.309 --> 01:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
the funding for the bill is actually in
 
01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
the text of the language uh the text of
 
01:03:11.349 --> 01:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
the bill itself
 
01:03:13.029 --> 01:03:13.039 align:start position:0%
it establishes the upland invasive
 
01:03:16.309 --> 01:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
species remediation program and fund and
 
01:03:17.829 --> 01:03:17.839 align:start position:0%
it makes an appropriation to that fund
 
01:03:21.029 --> 01:03:21.039 align:start position:0%
of 150 000 dollars
 
01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
with that that's pretty much the bill
 
01:03:25.349 --> 01:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take any questions
 
01:03:27.430 --> 01:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
thank you senator and sarah any
 
01:03:30.549 --> 01:03:30.559 align:start position:0%
questions for senator gaga
 
01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
representative dutzy yes thank you thank
 
01:03:35.589 --> 01:03:35.599 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question i know right
 
01:03:37.829 --> 01:03:37.839 align:start position:0%
now we have a gentleman by the name of
 
01:03:40.069 --> 01:03:40.079 align:start position:0%
doug saigon who works
 
01:03:41.670 --> 01:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
in agriculture and he's kind of the
 
01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
go-to guy for invasive plants and
 
01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:44.950 align:start position:0%
go-to guy for invasive plants and
everything

01:03:44.950 --> 01:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
everything
 
01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:45.990 align:start position:0%
everything
oh

01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:03:47.109 --> 01:03:47.119 align:start position:0%
you know i think there's a lot of
 
01:03:49.029 --> 01:03:49.039 align:start position:0%
education that's that's being done about
 
01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
that and i think a lot of conservation
 
01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
commissions around the state are working
 
01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
on that
 
01:03:57.109 --> 01:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
why um you know isn't isn't that enough
 
01:03:58.870 --> 01:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
isn't that enough that's being done why
 
01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
coordinating position across the state
 
01:04:10.549 --> 01:04:10.559 align:start position:0%
what's being done is basically voluntary
 
01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
he does a good job but we need more
 
01:04:16.069 --> 01:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
again the invasive species are exploding
 
01:04:18.309 --> 01:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
uh and to as a state i think we have an
 
01:04:20.710 --> 01:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
obligation to look into and to fund or
 
01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:22.799 align:start position:0%
certainly establish a centralized
 
01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
clearinghouse for information
 
01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
uh a perhaps a a person or a
 
01:04:31.109 --> 01:04:31.119 align:start position:0%
that would begin to look to legislation
 
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
for funding for programs to get rid of
 
01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
this stuff because it is invasive and
 
01:04:35.990 --> 01:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
and it's very difficult to get rid of
 
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.430 align:start position:0%
and it's very difficult to get rid of
d.o.t

01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
d.o.t
 
01:04:40.150 --> 01:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
has an invasive species program but it's
 
01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
only related to highways and state
 
01:04:44.789 --> 01:04:44.799 align:start position:0%
highways which
 
01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
by far are not the vast majority of the
 
01:04:48.390 --> 01:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
lands in the state
 
01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:49.670 align:start position:0%
lands in the state
so

01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:55.990 --> 01:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
in the bill you'll read that it the
 
01:04:58.789 --> 01:04:58.799 align:start position:0%
coordinator would make maps of statewide
 
01:05:01.270 --> 01:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
invasive species infestations notify
 
01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:02.630 align:start position:0%
invasive species infestations notify
municipalities

01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
hold a valid commercial category be
 
01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
pesticide application license maintain
 
01:05:08.309 --> 01:05:08.319 align:start position:0%
an active integrated vegetation
 
01:05:09.990 --> 01:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
management program
 
01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
basically sets up a system for this
 
01:05:14.069 --> 01:05:14.079 align:start position:0%
person to then systematize attacking
 
01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:19.270 --> 01:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
let's follow it
 
01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm sorry just to follow up
 
01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
so i'm on the nashua conservation
 
01:05:26.549 --> 01:05:26.559 align:start position:0%
commission and we do a lot with invasis
 
01:05:28.069 --> 01:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
invasives and we work a lot with the
 
01:05:28.079 --> 01:05:28.870 align:start position:0%
invasives and we work a lot with the
state

01:05:28.870 --> 01:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:05:32.630 --> 01:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
so what you're telling me right now
 
01:05:35.510 --> 01:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh already in in my opinion already goes
 
01:05:37.829 --> 01:05:37.839 align:start position:0%
on i mean in other words as as a
 
01:05:37.839 --> 01:05:38.950 align:start position:0%
on i mean in other words as as a
community

01:05:38.950 --> 01:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:05:41.430 --> 01:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh i mean there aren't there
 
01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
statewide maps in granite for example i
 
01:05:45.750 --> 01:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
mean if we come across an invasive
 
01:05:47.589 --> 01:05:47.599 align:start position:0%
species in nashua
 
01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh then we have the opportunity to to
 
01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
map that out and grant it and i believe
 
01:05:54.309 --> 01:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
this is a statewide map that's
 
01:05:56.549 --> 01:05:56.559 align:start position:0%
that's available to everybody we also
 
01:05:57.589 --> 01:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
work with
 
01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
unh extension on this
 
01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:00.870 align:start position:0%
unh extension on this
so

01:06:00.870 --> 01:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
you know from my perspective this is
 
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
already being done so i just need more
 
01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
enlightenment on that well it's being
 
01:06:09.510 --> 01:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
done by a volunteer right now
 
01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
and is being done in an uncoordinated
 
01:06:13.829 --> 01:06:13.839 align:start position:0%
way there's nothing of this nature up in
 
01:06:15.589 --> 01:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
my part of the state the 27 towns that
 
01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:17.200 align:start position:0%
represent most of them don't even have a
 
01:06:19.109 --> 01:06:19.119 align:start position:0%
conservation commission
 
01:06:21.270 --> 01:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
so this is a statewide problem
 
01:06:23.510 --> 01:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
and it requires a statewide oversight to
 
01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
coordinate what's going on because these
 
01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
invasive species don't care if it's in
 
01:06:28.069 --> 01:06:28.079 align:start position:0%
nashua it floats down the river a bird
 
01:06:29.190 --> 01:06:29.200 align:start position:0%
carries it over the next thing you know
 
01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
it's up in the north country so you need
 
01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
a statewide coordinator to deal with
 
01:06:34.710 --> 01:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
this problem it's been going on and
 
01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
increasing and getting worse and worse
 
01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
and worse and despite individual
 
01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:39.839 align:start position:0%
communities that have both the personnel
 
01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
resources as volunteers and perhaps paid
 
01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
staff and the funding in their tax base
 
01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:54.069 --> 01:06:54.079 align:start position:0%
that's an amendment and it is not
 
01:06:56.069 --> 01:06:56.079 align:start position:0%
exactly what was talked about with you
 
01:07:01.029 --> 01:07:01.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you senator
 
01:07:09.029 --> 01:07:09.039 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
as representative dutsy spoke to
 
01:07:15.029 --> 01:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
unh extension um does a lot with that
 
01:07:17.349 --> 01:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
and then most of the counties also have
 
01:07:18.870 --> 01:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
a um
 
01:07:21.270 --> 01:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
conservation district person that they
 
01:07:24.630 --> 01:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
pay on staff to help with all of this
 
01:07:27.190 --> 01:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
so now what you're and we also deal with
 
01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
the nrcs the national resource
 
01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:30.710 align:start position:0%
the nrcs the national resource
committees

01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
committees
 
01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:32.559 align:start position:0%
in our counties
 
01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
so why are we going to add a
 
01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
another position
 
01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
when we're already funding unh extension
 
01:07:45.430 --> 01:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
the county conservation
 
01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:46.470 align:start position:0%
the county conservation
people

01:07:46.470 --> 01:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:07:48.150 --> 01:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
and also
 
01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:50.069 align:start position:0%
and also
have

01:07:50.069 --> 01:07:50.079 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
access to nrcs
 
01:07:54.549 --> 01:07:54.559 align:start position:0%
so i'm just wondering why we're going to
 
01:07:57.190 --> 01:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
ask for more funding for this issue when
 
01:07:58.710 --> 01:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
i i believe
 
01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
at least in my county
 
01:08:03.670 --> 01:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
we take it seriously and we have a lot
 
01:08:05.589 --> 01:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
of people working on this program i
 
01:08:07.349 --> 01:08:07.359 align:start position:0%
would judge from the proliferation of
 
01:08:09.670 --> 01:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
invasive species around the state that
 
01:08:11.190 --> 01:08:11.200 align:start position:0%
whatever is happening is not being
 
01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
coordinated and it isn't working
 
01:08:15.990 --> 01:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
for the most part and so again
 
01:08:18.229 --> 01:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
since our forests are a state resource
 
01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
not a county resource
 
01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
and the private ownership our private
 
01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:23.990 align:start position:0%
and the private ownership our private
properties

01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
properties
 
01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
extend across the entirety of the state
 
01:08:27.510 --> 01:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
i think it makes a great deal of sense
 
01:08:29.669 --> 01:08:29.679 align:start position:0%
to establish a statewide coordinator to
 
01:08:32.070 --> 01:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
coordinate all of this stuff there's no
 
01:08:33.829 --> 01:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
requirement for the for the university
 
01:08:36.550 --> 01:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
system to oversee any of this
 
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
um and again
 
01:08:40.470 --> 01:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
as we sit here
 
01:08:42.550 --> 01:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
uh this stuff continues to proliferate
 
01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
and there are no multiple other species
 
01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
as well that are invasive that are
 
01:08:48.149 --> 01:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
growing so
 
01:08:49.669 --> 01:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
while it's nice that we have these
 
01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
organizations that are not currently
 
01:08:53.110 --> 01:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
coordinated i think a statewide
 
01:08:56.470 --> 01:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
coordinator makes a great deal of sense
 
01:09:01.030 --> 01:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:02.789 --> 01:09:02.799 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:09:05.590 --> 01:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
something that uh representative pearl
 
01:09:10.470 --> 01:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
noted to me and i um
 
01:09:13.990 --> 01:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
agree in turn with his concern uh
 
01:09:16.309 --> 01:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
in uh roman numeral one
 
01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh at the end of the the first paragraph
 
01:09:21.030 --> 01:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
before the bulleted list
 
01:09:23.189 --> 01:09:23.199 align:start position:0%
it says upland invasive species program
 
01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
coordinate coordinator shall
 
01:09:27.749 --> 01:09:27.759 align:start position:0%
and then if you go down to
 
01:09:27.759 --> 01:09:28.709 align:start position:0%
and then if you go down to
h

01:09:28.709 --> 01:09:28.719 align:start position:0%
h
 
01:09:30.309 --> 01:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
coordinate with state and federal
 
01:09:32.550 --> 01:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
agencies municipalities universities
 
01:09:33.910 --> 01:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
non-governmental environmental
 
01:09:35.910 --> 01:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
organizations the general public and
 
01:09:38.709 --> 01:09:38.719 align:start position:0%
others to help manage educate and raise
 
01:09:42.149 --> 01:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
awareness of invasive species and i'm
 
01:09:45.269 --> 01:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
sure the chair's concerned that having
 
01:09:46.789 --> 01:09:46.799 align:start position:0%
that shall there
 
01:09:50.709 --> 01:09:50.719 align:start position:0%
may in fact put an obligation on all of
 
01:09:53.110 --> 01:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
the entities in that list
 
01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:53.990 align:start position:0%
the entities in that list
and

01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.590 align:start position:0%
and
i

01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:09:57.270 --> 01:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
made an amendment which
 
01:10:00.149 --> 01:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
i just handed to you which
 
01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
can which changes the word coordinate to
 
01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:05.430 align:start position:0%
can which changes the word coordinate to
um

01:10:05.430 --> 01:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:08.149 --> 01:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
uh to invite participation of
 
01:10:10.950 --> 01:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
and that takes the obligation off of
 
01:10:15.189 --> 01:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
those uh those organizations so um
 
01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
i was wondering if you would be in favor
 
01:10:19.350 --> 01:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
of that uh amen um sure
 
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
i don't see that as problematic in fact
 
01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
yeah i would support such an amendment
 
01:10:25.110 --> 01:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
and uh representative pearl also
 
01:10:27.030 --> 01:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
uh had some issue with
 
01:10:29.669 --> 01:10:29.679 align:start position:0%
the uh including uh non-governmental
 
01:10:31.669 --> 01:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
environmental organizations
 
01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
i personally
 
01:10:36.070 --> 01:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
think that they would be involved
 
01:10:38.229 --> 01:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
that it makes sense to involve them and
 
01:10:40.229 --> 01:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
to specify them because they are a
 
01:10:42.390 --> 01:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
significant stakeholder
 
01:10:45.030 --> 01:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
but um that's i i was wondering if you
 
01:10:47.350 --> 01:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
could address if you have um an opinion
 
01:10:49.189 --> 01:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
about that or not
 
01:10:50.950 --> 01:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
yeah i have concerns that if we
 
01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:52.229 align:start position:0%
yeah i have concerns that if we
incorporate

01:10:52.229 --> 01:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
incorporate
 
01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
ngos we start making this a political
 
01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:55.510 align:start position:0%
ngos we start making this a political
issue

01:10:55.510 --> 01:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:10:57.030 --> 01:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
that's not what this commit this
 
01:10:59.030 --> 01:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
position or this program is about
 
01:11:00.709 --> 01:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
they're certainly welcome to participate
 
01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
and testify at hearings and so forth
 
01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
but i do have a concern
 
01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:12.149 --> 01:11:12.159 align:start position:0%
attempting to hijack something rather
 
01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
than just participating in a discussion
 
01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh as if you will a witness to a
 
01:11:20.229 --> 01:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
particular bill or a program
 
01:11:23.990 --> 01:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
okay so um just as um
 
01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
so i had i had a
 
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
different amendment uh drafted that i
 
01:11:32.790 --> 01:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
had intended to in re re remove that
 
01:11:34.630 --> 01:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
term but only half of the term got
 
01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:35.910 align:start position:0%
term but only half of the term got
removed

01:11:35.910 --> 01:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
removed
 
01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
01:11:40.070 --> 01:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to need to go back to ols
 
01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
if um if the committee feels that uh it
 
01:11:48.310 --> 01:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
makes sense to remove that uh
 
01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
that the the non-governmental
 
01:11:53.030 --> 01:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
environmental organizations then i can
 
01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
change the amendment to
 
01:11:57.350 --> 01:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
to deal with that
 
01:11:58.630 --> 01:11:58.640 align:start position:0%
i would leave that to the discretion of
 
01:12:00.070 --> 01:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:12:01.510 --> 01:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
 
01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:05.110 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
comtel

01:12:05.110 --> 01:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
comtel
 
01:12:06.550 --> 01:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you senator
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
again um how will this will this have
 
01:12:11.510 --> 01:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
any impact on the aquatic invasive
 
01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
species program that we now have in the
 
01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
state no no it will not um
 
01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
while the commit it's envisioned that
 
01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
this person
 
01:12:22.630 --> 01:12:22.640 align:start position:0%
and this program would certainly
 
01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:23.990 align:start position:0%
and this program would certainly
coordinate

01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
coordinate
 
01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
with it does not have any impact on
 
01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:26.709 align:start position:0%
with it does not have any impact on
funding

01:12:26.709 --> 01:12:26.719 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:12:29.669 --> 01:12:29.679 align:start position:0%
positions or any other functions of the
 
01:12:33.990 --> 01:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:37.510 --> 01:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:39.669 --> 01:12:39.679 align:start position:0%
thank you senator guida for coming today
 
01:12:41.750 --> 01:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
and introducing this to us to our
 
01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:42.950 align:start position:0%
and introducing this to us to our
committee

01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
01:12:46.709 --> 01:12:46.719 align:start position:0%
you had mentioned about
 
01:12:48.790 --> 01:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
how this position would be funded in the
 
01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
next budget cycle could you talk about
 
01:12:52.950 --> 01:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
that a little bit more i mean
 
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
how we're looking at funding it
 
01:12:57.030 --> 01:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
may be
 
01:12:59.669 --> 01:12:59.679 align:start position:0%
initially here for this
 
01:13:02.630 --> 01:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh non-non-budget year and then how that
 
01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
would roll into the next budget cycle
 
01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for the question it's a
 
01:13:07.590 --> 01:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
good question
 
01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:09.270 align:start position:0%
good question
uh

01:13:09.270 --> 01:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
in that
 
01:13:12.149 --> 01:13:12.159 align:start position:0%
the individual who's feeling
 
01:13:14.790 --> 01:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
voluntarily this function at agriculture
 
01:13:16.470 --> 01:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
markets and foods
 
01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:18.310 align:start position:0%
markets and foods
uh

01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
is holding a position already what we
 
01:13:23.110 --> 01:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to do was fund the tools for this
 
01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
person to be able to function
 
01:13:28.149 --> 01:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
still in that capacity essentially as a
 
01:13:29.590 --> 01:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
volunteer and leave it to the next
 
01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
legislature in the budget process i'm
 
01:13:33.990 --> 01:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
reluctant to establish new positions in
 
01:13:35.669 --> 01:13:35.679 align:start position:0%
the interim year between budgets that's
 
01:13:37.030 --> 01:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
something that the legislature should
 
01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
look at and that's the reason for
 
01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
funding 150 000 for equipment
 
01:13:42.630 --> 01:13:42.640 align:start position:0%
allowing this gentleman to continue to
 
01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
do what he's doing
 
01:13:46.950 --> 01:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
in preparation for uh you know the
 
01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
discussion that will ensue regarding
 
01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
invasive species in the next budget and
 
01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
potentially establishing a position then
 
01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:13:57.750 --> 01:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
01:14:02.550 --> 01:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
next we'll have uh represent
 
01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
representative suzanne smith from
 
01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:12.870 align:start position:0%
representative suzanne smith from
grafton8

01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:15.189 --> 01:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
good morning and welcome to ena and good
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
morning mr chair and members of the
 
01:14:20.550 --> 01:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
committee and i am not representing
 
01:14:23.189 --> 01:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
aquatic invasive species right now
 
01:14:26.310 --> 01:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
but upland invasive species and i am in
 
01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
full support of senate bill 267 of which
 
01:14:31.110 --> 01:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
i am a co-sponsor
 
01:14:33.189 --> 01:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
and i am a member of hebron's
 
01:14:35.590 --> 01:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
conservation commission and we recently
 
01:14:38.229 --> 01:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
held an invasive species day in the fall
 
01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
where we came up with like 20 foot long
 
01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
bittersweet roots and
 
01:14:46.229 --> 01:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
autumn olive
 
01:14:49.270 --> 01:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
barberry multiflora rosa and then along
 
01:14:51.669 --> 01:14:51.679 align:start position:0%
our roads as many of you probably have
 
01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
we have knotweed growing
 
01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
and it takes a diligent effort by
 
01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
volunteers to
 
01:15:01.590 --> 01:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
try to remediate these things and i
 
01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
often will make phone calls probably
 
01:15:07.830 --> 01:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
once a year to mr seigens at des at a
 
01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
department of agriculture markets and
 
01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:10.470 align:start position:0%
department of agriculture markets and
food

01:15:10.470 --> 01:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
food
 
01:15:11.910 --> 01:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
who as
 
01:15:14.630 --> 01:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
the senator said pretty much has added
 
01:15:17.510 --> 01:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
on taking care of upland invasives to
 
01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
his regular job
 
01:15:22.709 --> 01:15:22.719 align:start position:0%
and in and he's been very good at it but
 
01:15:24.709 --> 01:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
this coordinator position i think is
 
01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
really important as we heard earlier in
 
01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
the presentation those of you who were
 
01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
here for the presentation of the aquatic
 
01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:32.310 align:start position:0%
here for the presentation of the aquatic
invasives

01:15:32.310 --> 01:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
invasives
 
01:15:36.390 --> 01:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
des has a biologist who is in charge of
 
01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
aquatic invasive species at des and i
 
01:15:42.390 --> 01:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
think that upland invasives are
 
01:15:45.270 --> 01:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
as huge an issue and probably even more
 
01:15:47.430 --> 01:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
so because they're not just in water
 
01:15:49.430 --> 01:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
they're all over the place
 
01:15:51.910 --> 01:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
and so this position i think is really
 
01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:53.110 align:start position:0%
and so this position i think is really
important

01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:15:55.590 --> 01:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
and i know there was talk there people
 
01:15:57.669 --> 01:15:57.679 align:start position:0%
were asking questions about conservation
 
01:16:00.070 --> 01:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
commissions already doing this but in my
 
01:16:02.310 --> 01:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
area around newfound lake
 
01:16:04.630 --> 01:16:04.640 align:start position:0%
and that whole watershed
 
01:16:05.910 --> 01:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
half of the towns don't have
 
01:16:07.990 --> 01:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
conservation commissions
 
01:16:10.149 --> 01:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
some have no idea what they even look
 
01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
like and i still get a lot of questions
 
01:16:13.910 --> 01:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
from people saying
 
01:16:16.149 --> 01:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
well why is bittersweet bad why can't i
 
01:16:17.910 --> 01:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
pick the berries and put them on my
 
01:16:19.669 --> 01:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
wreath in them you know at christmas
 
01:16:19.679 --> 01:16:20.870 align:start position:0%
wreath in them you know at christmas
time

01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:16:22.950 --> 01:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
and it's you know so it's a challenge
 
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
education is a challenge and one of the
 
01:16:27.110 --> 01:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
things i particularly like about this
 
01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:27.910 align:start position:0%
things i particularly like about this
bill

01:16:27.910 --> 01:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:16:29.510 --> 01:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
is that one person from each
 
01:16:32.470 --> 01:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
municipality will be designated to be
 
01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
the in-charge person and that person
 
01:16:35.270 --> 01:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
will probably have a little more
 
01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
education than
 
01:16:39.189 --> 01:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
uh the rest of the public and so they
 
01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
will be able to work more one-on-one
 
01:16:43.830 --> 01:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
with the invasive species
 
01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
program coordinator
 
01:16:49.110 --> 01:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
and the education that can be provided
 
01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
to community members
 
01:16:53.669 --> 01:16:53.679 align:start position:0%
uh isn't just pulling up the weeds it
 
01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
require you know and in the bill if you
 
01:16:57.669 --> 01:16:57.679 align:start position:0%
look at
 
01:16:59.030 --> 01:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
in the uh d line 12 d maintain an active
 
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
integrative vegetation management
 
01:17:07.910 --> 01:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
program that includes a combination of
 
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
mechanical cultural biological and
 
01:17:12.590 --> 01:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
chemical controls to prevent and
 
01:17:15.990 --> 01:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
inhibit the spread of invasive species
 
01:17:17.510 --> 01:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
so the
 
01:17:21.189 --> 01:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
people the designated person in each
 
01:17:21.199 --> 01:17:22.229 align:start position:0%
people the designated person in each
town

01:17:22.229 --> 01:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
town
 
01:17:24.070 --> 01:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
can be working with their team to
 
01:17:26.709 --> 01:17:26.719 align:start position:0%
evaluate what is going on and that try
 
01:17:28.470 --> 01:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
to use the
 
01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
integrative management you know with the
 
01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
pulling and the mechanical means and
 
01:17:36.229 --> 01:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
then go to the coordinator to say okay
 
01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
we can't deal with this the knotweed is
 
01:17:39.830 --> 01:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
just too prolific
 
01:17:42.390 --> 01:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
and in my town i want to say and i'm not
 
01:17:44.229 --> 01:17:44.239 align:start position:0%
a proud of this but a couple of people
 
01:17:45.590 --> 01:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
went out and decided they were going to
 
01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
get rid of the knotweed and without
 
01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
having a license or doing anything they
 
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
went out and started just like spraying
 
01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:53.430 align:start position:0%
went out and started just like spraying
roundup

01:17:53.430 --> 01:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
roundup
 
01:17:55.669 --> 01:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
on the knotweed which you know helped
 
01:17:57.990 --> 01:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
that year but didn't do any good for the
 
01:18:00.550 --> 01:18:00.560 align:start position:0%
watershed so i think this is a really
 
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
important uh bill and i think that this
 
01:18:05.590 --> 01:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
program coordinator and
 
01:18:08.070 --> 01:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
then the outreach to the communities is
 
01:18:10.870 --> 01:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
also very important and needed at this
 
01:18:12.790 --> 01:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
time in the state
 
01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
so i can take questions but that's
 
01:18:17.110 --> 01:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
pretty much all i had to say
 
01:18:19.030 --> 01:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
all right do we have any questions for
 
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
representative smith representative
 
01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:22.550 align:start position:0%
representative smith representative
dotsy

01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
dotsy
 
01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you for taking my question
 
01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
that's one of the issues that i have
 
01:18:27.990 --> 01:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
with the bill
 
01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
in that you talk about a let's say a
 
01:18:32.310 --> 01:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
municipal coordinator okay
 
01:18:35.830 --> 01:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
um i look at nashua and everybody in our
 
01:18:37.830 --> 01:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
community planning department is you
 
01:18:40.709 --> 01:18:40.719 align:start position:0%
know probably has about a hundred and
 
01:18:44.149 --> 01:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
ten percent of their job already defined
 
01:18:47.189 --> 01:18:47.199 align:start position:0%
so who is this person going to be
 
01:18:49.270 --> 01:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
in and especially in a small town who is
 
01:18:51.270 --> 01:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
this person going to be
 
01:18:55.110 --> 01:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
i think that is up to the town and in my
 
01:18:57.910 --> 01:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
town i can bet almost anything it's
 
01:18:59.510 --> 01:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
going to be someone on the conservation
 
01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:03.350 align:start position:0%
going to be someone on the conservation
commission

01:19:03.350 --> 01:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
so that's another volunteer
 
01:19:07.590 --> 01:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
oh yeah i mean i mean it's either
 
01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
someone who is getting paid like the
 
01:19:12.630 --> 01:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
compliance officer or someone like that
 
01:19:14.470 --> 01:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
may choose to do it because
 
01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
um it is that person will also if
 
01:19:18.870 --> 01:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
they're going to be using possibly
 
01:19:20.550 --> 01:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
herbicides will need to be have be a
 
01:19:23.110 --> 01:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
licensed applicator so it's up to the
 
01:19:24.870 --> 01:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
community to figure it out and i would
 
01:19:26.709 --> 01:19:26.719 align:start position:0%
think as a member of the conservation
 
01:19:30.070 --> 01:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
commission i would be working with other
 
01:19:32.790 --> 01:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
people in the community to say okay who
 
01:19:35.110 --> 01:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
can we do this to who can we add this to
 
01:19:37.510 --> 01:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
their job or do we have a volunteer who
 
01:19:39.510 --> 01:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
wants to do this because they're going
 
01:19:42.390 --> 01:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
to be educated doing it and also will be
 
01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
able to
 
01:19:45.189 --> 01:19:45.199 align:start position:0%
get an herbicide license if they're
 
01:19:47.110 --> 01:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
interested and then be able to use that
 
01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:48.229 align:start position:0%
interested and then be able to use that
for

01:19:48.229 --> 01:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:19:50.470 --> 01:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
other jobs that they're doing okay thank
 
01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:52.229 align:start position:0%
other jobs that they're doing okay thank
you

01:19:52.229 --> 01:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:19:54.630 --> 01:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
01:19:56.550 --> 01:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you okay thank you
 
01:19:58.390 --> 01:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
very much

next we will have pierre siegert from uh
 
01:20:06.870 --> 01:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:07.840 align:start position:0%

very i have an advantage i've seen it
before

01:20:12.629 --> 01:20:12.639 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:20:14.390 --> 01:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
thank you and welcome to dna well thank
 
01:20:15.910 --> 01:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
you so piera siegert i'm the state
 
01:20:17.110 --> 01:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
entomologist and the director of the
 
01:20:19.030 --> 01:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
division of plant industry i'm here
 
01:20:20.229 --> 01:20:20.239 align:start position:0%
representing the new hampshire
 
01:20:21.990 --> 01:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
department of agriculture markets and
 
01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:22.950 align:start position:0%
department of agriculture markets and
food

01:20:22.950 --> 01:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
food
 
01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
we are in support of this bill and
 
01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
provided input to senator guida as he
 
01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
was drafting it um i didn't have any
 
01:20:30.550 --> 01:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
further comments but there do seem to be
 
01:20:32.709 --> 01:20:32.719 align:start position:0%
some questions about how the invasive
 
01:20:34.310 --> 01:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
species program currently works in the
 
01:20:35.590 --> 01:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
department and i would be happy to
 
01:20:37.510 --> 01:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
entertain those
 
01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
all right i actually have one about the
 
01:20:41.430 --> 01:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
bill itself a question and i'm not sure
 
01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
if you'll be able to answer it it might
 
01:20:47.030 --> 01:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
need to go to david russo the
 
01:20:48.629 --> 01:20:48.639 align:start position:0%
line 15
 
01:20:51.669 --> 01:20:51.679 align:start position:0%
section one the it the
 
01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
coordinator shall purchase herbicides in
 
01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
bulk in order to reduce purchasing costs
 
01:20:55.760 --> 01:20:58.229 align:start position:0%
bulk in order to reduce purchasing costs
municipalities

01:20:58.229 --> 01:20:58.239 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
having a strong background in the sale
 
01:21:02.709 --> 01:21:02.719 align:start position:0%
of pesticides
 
01:21:04.390 --> 01:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
we actually would he actually be allowed
 
01:21:05.669 --> 01:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
to do this and distribute to
 
01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities without running into a
 
01:21:09.830 --> 01:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
licensing issue that would be a better
 
01:21:12.709 --> 01:21:12.719 align:start position:0%
question for david russo okay i'm sorry
 
01:21:14.390 --> 01:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
that's fine i kind of looked at that
 
01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
just now and it caught my attention i
 
01:21:17.110 --> 01:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
know it's kind of a technical question
 
01:21:18.550 --> 01:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
but all right that's fair enough any
 
01:21:22.229 --> 01:21:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:23.660 --> 01:21:23.670 align:start position:0%
you may get off really easy
 
01:21:23.670 --> 01:21:25.350 align:start position:0%
you may get off really easy
[Laughter]

01:21:25.350 --> 01:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:21:26.870 --> 01:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
i'm ready but
 
01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
all right well anything further you want
 
01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
to add
 
01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:31.590 align:start position:0%
to add
um

01:21:31.590 --> 01:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
i guess i guess i would just reiterate
 
01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
that on the ground watching how this
 
01:21:37.510 --> 01:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
program works there's essentially two
 
01:21:39.990 --> 01:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
areas of focus in in the division about
 
01:21:42.629 --> 01:21:42.639 align:start position:0%
upland invasive species uh maybe three
 
01:21:44.950 --> 01:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
if i add an outreach so the first is
 
01:21:46.149 --> 01:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
that a number of plants on the
 
01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
prohibited invasive plant list have in
 
01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
traditionally been nursery stock plants
 
01:21:54.229 --> 01:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
and so a big focus in the division right
 
01:21:55.830 --> 01:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
now is ensuring that those are not being
 
01:21:57.669 --> 01:21:57.679 align:start position:0%
offered for sale um through the
 
01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
nurseries and i have four people in the
 
01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
division all of us do some nursery
 
01:22:04.629 --> 01:22:04.639 align:start position:0%
inspections and so all four of us are
 
01:22:06.790 --> 01:22:06.800 align:start position:0%
kind of attending to the to the um
 
01:22:09.270 --> 01:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
to the nursery stock pathway
 
01:22:13.270 --> 01:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
another area of focus is outreach and i
 
01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
i think that we've got excellent
 
01:22:16.629 --> 01:22:16.639 align:start position:0%
outreach materials about all of these
 
01:22:19.110 --> 01:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
invasive plants we've got the prohibited
 
01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
invasive upland species guide which is
 
01:22:24.709 --> 01:22:24.719 align:start position:0%
i can't remember which edition has been
 
01:22:26.390 --> 01:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
reprinted recently but it's in constant
 
01:22:28.870 --> 01:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
demand by the towns um it's posted on
 
01:22:31.750 --> 01:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
our website we have a japanese knotweed
 
01:22:33.510 --> 01:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
best management practices manual that
 
01:22:35.110 --> 01:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
was distributed to
 
01:22:37.590 --> 01:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
all of the dot districts as well as i
 
01:22:39.189 --> 01:22:39.199 align:start position:0%
think the towns
 
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
that's also available on their website a
 
01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
lot of other states do request
 
01:22:46.790 --> 01:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
use of some of the outreach materials
 
01:22:48.550 --> 01:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
that we have developed
 
01:22:51.669 --> 01:22:51.679 align:start position:0%
all of that is being funded through
 
01:22:54.790 --> 01:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
ipm grants requested from
 
01:22:56.470 --> 01:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
the ipm fund
 
01:22:58.470 --> 01:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
there's no dedicated fund for those
 
01:23:00.390 --> 01:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
outreach materials and then the third
 
01:23:01.590 --> 01:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
part is
 
01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
the part which is more related to
 
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
management and that really is utilizing
 
01:23:09.270 --> 01:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
mr saigan's experience with other state
 
01:23:11.830 --> 01:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
agencies and with the extensive amount
 
01:23:13.830 --> 01:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
of outreach that he has done with towns
 
01:23:17.189 --> 01:23:17.199 align:start position:0%
over the years to try to
 
01:23:19.110 --> 01:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
work on some projects there is our
 
01:23:21.030 --> 01:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
projects with dot for controlling
 
01:23:22.870 --> 01:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
japanese knotweed
 
01:23:25.350 --> 01:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
along roadways
 
01:23:27.510 --> 01:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
none of that has any funding behind it
 
01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of how it is managed and so
 
01:23:31.030 --> 01:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
that's with pesticides that are
 
01:23:32.950 --> 01:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
purchased by dot
 
01:23:35.110 --> 01:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
with equipment that's purchased by dot
 
01:23:37.030 --> 01:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
and then time from the department of
 
01:23:39.669 --> 01:23:39.679 align:start position:0%
agriculture for for doug's time in
 
01:23:43.350 --> 01:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
training and applying herbicides uh and
 
01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
so the benefit that i see to the um
 
01:23:48.870 --> 01:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
to this bill is the hundred and fifty
 
01:23:51.990 --> 01:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars of seed funding um that
 
01:23:54.149 --> 01:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
would you know be more than what is
 
01:23:55.990 --> 01:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
currently allocated to the invasive
 
01:23:59.110 --> 01:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
species program um in order to extend
 
01:24:02.229 --> 01:24:02.239 align:start position:0%
the program to towns that maybe are not
 
01:24:04.070 --> 01:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
as well established with their county
 
01:24:05.510 --> 01:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
conservation districts and their in
 
01:24:08.790 --> 01:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:24:11.270 --> 01:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
rep pamola
 
01:24:13.110 --> 01:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
so you may have inspired a question well
 
01:24:14.950 --> 01:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious what is the current
 
01:24:17.189 --> 01:24:17.199 align:start position:0%
funding then if you said if the 150 000
 
01:24:18.950 --> 01:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
exceeds it right now there's no
 
01:24:22.149 --> 01:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
allocation for for treatment of invasive
 
01:24:24.550 --> 01:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
plants thank you
 
01:24:26.790 --> 01:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
representative dutzy
 
01:24:28.709 --> 01:24:28.719 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you
 
01:24:30.950 --> 01:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
so my understanding going back is that
 
01:24:32.709 --> 01:24:32.719 align:start position:0%
when conservation
 
01:24:34.950 --> 01:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
when the law allowed conservation
 
01:24:37.669 --> 01:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
commissions it was actually enabling
 
01:24:37.679 --> 01:24:39.110 align:start position:0%
commissions it was actually enabling
legislation

01:24:39.110 --> 01:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:39.990 align:start position:0%
legislation
so

01:24:39.990 --> 01:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:24:41.030 --> 01:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
if a
 
01:24:42.870 --> 01:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
town has chosen not to have a
 
01:24:44.629 --> 01:24:44.639 align:start position:0%
conservation commission
 
01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
why would we think that they would um
 
01:24:49.910 --> 01:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
have the personnel or the interest in
 
01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
doing something with invasives
 
01:24:54.550 --> 01:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
i don't know how to answer exactly the
 
01:24:57.030 --> 01:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
question you just asked me in all
 
01:25:00.070 --> 01:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
fairness um i i will say
 
01:25:02.229 --> 01:25:02.239 align:start position:0%
um that
 
01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
you know there's a lot of local control
 
01:25:06.310 --> 01:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
here right and so if a town isn't
 
01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:07.350 align:start position:0%
here right and so if a town isn't
interested

01:25:07.350 --> 01:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
interested
 
01:25:09.590 --> 01:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
you know i don't know that you would
 
01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
have them be interested
 
01:25:14.229 --> 01:25:14.239 align:start position:0%
we do get a lot of calls from different
 
01:25:14.239 --> 01:25:15.830 align:start position:0%
we do get a lot of calls from different
towns

01:25:15.830 --> 01:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
towns
 
01:25:17.910 --> 01:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
requesting doug's ability to give
 
01:25:20.149 --> 01:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
presentations requesting information on
 
01:25:23.189 --> 01:25:23.199 align:start position:0%
invasive species and i believe that unh
 
01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
extension did put together a survey
 
01:25:29.030 --> 01:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
several years ago with different
 
01:25:30.870 --> 01:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
land managers
 
01:25:33.189 --> 01:25:33.199 align:start position:0%
pesticide applicators groups that are
 
01:25:35.669 --> 01:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
involved with invasive species in terms
 
01:25:37.669 --> 01:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
of what they saw the needs were to
 
01:25:39.189 --> 01:25:39.199 align:start position:0%
further develop the programs and they
 
01:25:41.510 --> 01:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
did say better coordination was it was
 
01:25:43.189 --> 01:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
one of the needs that they had cited
 
01:25:43.199 --> 01:25:44.470 align:start position:0%
one of the needs that they had cited
there

01:25:44.470 --> 01:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:25:46.070 --> 01:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
and i know i did not directly answer
 
01:25:48.470 --> 01:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
your question i'm sorry about that
 
01:25:50.470 --> 01:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
01:25:51.910 --> 01:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none
 
01:25:53.430 --> 01:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
so that's all the cards i have on this
 
01:25:55.189 --> 01:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
is refamila if you get the blue sheet

01:28:15.199 --> 01:28:40.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:28:40.950 --> 01:28:40.960 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman members of the

nice to see you all senator david waters
 
01:31:01.030 --> 01:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
from district four introducing senate
 
01:31:04.470 --> 01:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
bill 379 establishing the solid waste
 
01:31:06.390 --> 01:31:06.400 align:start position:0%
management fund and
 
01:31:07.830 --> 01:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
grant program
 
01:31:09.990 --> 01:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
um i don't need to tell you there's just
 
01:31:12.310 --> 01:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of activity around solid waste
 
01:31:14.470 --> 01:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
we're trying in many ways as we can not
 
01:31:16.870 --> 01:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
just about the dalton situation but more
 
01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
generally about solid waste and as you
 
01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:20.709 align:start position:0%
generally about solid waste and as you
know

01:31:20.709 --> 01:31:20.719 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:31:23.430 --> 01:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
the house bill that established the
 
01:31:25.669 --> 01:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
study committee is doing great work and
 
01:31:28.470 --> 01:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
the bill we passed last year which
 
01:31:32.229 --> 01:31:32.239 align:start position:0%
required the des to develop a 10-year
 
01:31:35.030 --> 01:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
plan which had been in hiatus for solid
 
01:31:37.830 --> 01:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
waste management and reduction and there
 
01:31:39.189 --> 01:31:39.199 align:start position:0%
are lots of other bills about you know
 
01:31:41.830 --> 01:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
how do we reduce the stream and uh of
 
01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
that and encourage more recycling and
 
01:31:46.470 --> 01:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
what are we going to do about siting
 
01:31:48.629 --> 01:31:48.639 align:start position:0%
facilities well let's see if we can't
 
01:31:50.709 --> 01:31:50.719 align:start position:0%
i'll be you know obviate the need for
 
01:31:53.510 --> 01:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
that by dealing with our our waste
 
01:31:55.510 --> 01:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
so i worked
 
01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:57.189 align:start position:0%
so i worked
with

01:31:57.189 --> 01:31:57.199 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:31:59.430 --> 01:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
des and others
 
01:32:01.669 --> 01:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
to develop this bill which will help us
 
01:32:04.390 --> 01:32:04.400 align:start position:0%
prepare for this changing landscape by
 
01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:05.590 align:start position:0%
prepare for this changing landscape by
establishing

01:32:05.590 --> 01:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
establishing
 
01:32:07.030 --> 01:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
a fund
 
01:32:09.270 --> 01:32:09.280 align:start position:0%
that would be available
 
01:32:11.669 --> 01:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
with the parameters to find the bill for
 
01:32:13.590 --> 01:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
federal funding that we expect to
 
01:32:16.629 --> 01:32:16.639 align:start position:0%
receive for solid waste management
 
01:32:18.390 --> 01:32:18.400 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of bill a lot of money in
 
01:32:19.990 --> 01:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
an infrastructure bill
 
01:32:21.669 --> 01:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
potentially from other sources as well
 
01:32:23.430 --> 01:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
particularly through epa
 
01:32:26.070 --> 01:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
grant funds that we do expect to receive
 
01:32:29.350 --> 01:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
and we'll be able to use to manage
 
01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
solid waste
 
01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
so um and i think also that having a
 
01:32:35.910 --> 01:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund with some legislative
 
01:32:37.750 --> 01:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
language around its purpose will give us
 
01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
a leg up
 
01:32:41.189 --> 01:32:41.199 align:start position:0%
on applying for funding because it shows
 
01:32:43.110 --> 01:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
that we have a vehicle and legislative
 
01:32:46.470 --> 01:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
intent around it
 
01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
so the heart of it
 
01:32:49.910 --> 01:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
is what we can do with it starting on
 
01:32:52.629 --> 01:32:52.639 align:start position:0%
line 22 and you know over the last
 
01:32:53.990 --> 01:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
couple of years all the debates on the
 
01:32:55.990 --> 01:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
bills these seem to be
 
01:32:58.070 --> 01:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
the things that we think we could do the
 
01:32:59.990 --> 01:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
most good with the funding that we're
 
01:33:01.990 --> 01:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
going to receive
 
01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:02.870 align:start position:0%
going to receive
so

01:33:02.870 --> 01:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:33:04.070 --> 01:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
let's help out new hampshire
 
01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:06.070 align:start position:0%
let's help out new hampshire
municipalities

01:33:06.070 --> 01:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:33:08.790 --> 01:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
and private entities and businesses
 
01:33:10.229 --> 01:33:10.239 align:start position:0%
for projects
 
01:33:11.590 --> 01:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
that will help
 
01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:12.470 align:start position:0%
that will help
to

01:33:12.470 --> 01:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:33:15.270 --> 01:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
improve waste diversion methods
 
01:33:16.629 --> 01:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
it could be
 
01:33:16.639 --> 01:33:17.669 align:start position:0%
it could be
helping

01:33:17.669 --> 01:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
helping
 
01:33:18.790 --> 01:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
one of our municipalities get a
 
01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:20.830 align:start position:0%
one of our municipalities get a
compactor

01:33:20.830 --> 01:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
compactor
 
01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
equipment uh develop more recycling um
 
01:33:26.870 --> 01:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
programs uh businesses to help reduce
 
01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:27.669 align:start position:0%
programs uh businesses to help reduce
their

01:33:27.669 --> 01:33:27.679 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:33:30.390 --> 01:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
waste stream um so those are the kinds
 
01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
of uh things that you know
 
01:33:33.910 --> 01:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities and others are really are
 
01:33:35.830 --> 01:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
really uh
 
01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:37.110 align:start position:0%
really uh
for

01:33:37.110 --> 01:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:33:39.110 --> 01:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
last we've got to reduce waste but you
 
01:33:41.910 --> 01:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
know we're in the era of pfas folks and
 
01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:42.790 align:start position:0%
know we're in the era of pfas folks and
other

01:33:42.790 --> 01:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:33:44.870 --> 01:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
toxic materials that we don't want our
 
01:33:47.430 --> 01:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
landfills so here
 
01:33:49.830 --> 01:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
how to reduce hazardous waste materials
 
01:33:51.990 --> 01:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
and what might this fund do to provide
 
01:33:55.110 --> 01:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
grants so that we can do that reduction
 
01:33:56.470 --> 01:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:33:58.950 --> 01:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
diversion of of those
 
01:34:00.709 --> 01:34:00.719 align:start position:0%
um and then the fund we ought to
 
01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
identify that um you know we're not
 
01:34:05.910 --> 01:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
seeking new employees here um
 
01:34:07.750 --> 01:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
through state appropriations saying that
 
01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
you know you can
 
01:34:11.830 --> 01:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
use the fund as it comes in um
 
01:34:13.830 --> 01:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
to hire consultant contractors necessary
 
01:34:16.550 --> 01:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
expenses uh involved with managing the
 
01:34:19.189 --> 01:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
fund and getting grants out and then top
 
01:34:21.910 --> 01:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
of page two
 
01:34:25.030 --> 01:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
the epa is the agency that has these
 
01:34:27.990 --> 01:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
monies deposited in it that can go out
 
01:34:29.750 --> 01:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
to the states
 
01:34:30.870 --> 01:34:30.880 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:34:33.750 --> 01:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner can do rulemaking involved
 
01:34:36.709 --> 01:34:36.719 align:start position:0%
in the grant grant programs and uh the
 
01:34:38.149 --> 01:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
you know how matching funds are gonna be
 
01:34:40.709 --> 01:34:40.719 align:start position:0%
determined and and gotten out to
 
01:34:40.719 --> 01:34:41.510 align:start position:0%
determined and and gotten out to
uh

01:34:41.510 --> 01:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:34:45.270 --> 01:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
folks um we're gonna get reports
 
01:34:47.750 --> 01:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
on the activities as the funding
 
01:34:51.030 --> 01:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh is is used and then um
 
01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:51.910 align:start position:0%
uh is is used and then um
some

01:34:51.910 --> 01:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:34:53.990 --> 01:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
you know kind of details that fall out
 
01:34:56.070 --> 01:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
uh from that so the bill itself is
 
01:34:57.669 --> 01:34:57.679 align:start position:0%
fairly simple setting up the fund saying
 
01:34:59.430 --> 01:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
this is what it's for and we're
 
01:35:01.990 --> 01:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
anticipating this this money
 
01:35:04.470 --> 01:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
and this at least let us do do something
 
01:35:06.950 --> 01:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
to help out with the solid waste issues
 
01:35:08.310 --> 01:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
that we're facing so thank you mr
 
01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:10.070 align:start position:0%
that we're facing so thank you mr
chairman

01:35:10.070 --> 01:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:35:11.270 --> 01:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
do you have time for any questions or do
 
01:35:13.109 --> 01:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
you need to run
 
01:35:14.310 --> 01:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
do you have time for questions or do you
 
01:35:15.350 --> 01:35:15.360 align:start position:0%
need your own
 
01:35:18.790 --> 01:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:20.229 --> 01:35:20.239 align:start position:0%
thank you senator thank you for taking
 
01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
my question uh
 
01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:23.430 align:start position:0%
my question uh
so

01:35:23.430 --> 01:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:35:25.990 --> 01:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh one uh
 
01:35:27.669 --> 01:35:27.679 align:start position:0%
thing that i'm kind of wondering about
 
01:35:29.830 --> 01:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
is the long-term sustainability of the
 
01:35:31.590 --> 01:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
funding for this i
 
01:35:34.149 --> 01:35:34.159 align:start position:0%
there is currently grant money available
 
01:35:36.070 --> 01:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
apparently at the federal level
 
01:35:38.550 --> 01:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
what happens uh four or five years down
 
01:35:40.149 --> 01:35:40.159 align:start position:0%
the road do we
 
01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
then get into a situation where we have
 
01:35:43.350 --> 01:35:43.360 align:start position:0%
been funding something for a little
 
01:35:45.669 --> 01:35:45.679 align:start position:0%
while and then we
 
01:35:47.590 --> 01:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
no longer have the funding for that
 
01:35:50.149 --> 01:35:50.159 align:start position:0%
similar to how we funded solid waste
 
01:35:53.270 --> 01:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
programs in the late 90s early 2000s and
 
01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:54.390 align:start position:0%
programs in the late 90s early 2000s and
then

01:35:54.390 --> 01:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:55.350 align:start position:0%
then
we

01:35:55.350 --> 01:35:55.360 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:35:59.189 --> 01:35:59.199 align:start position:0%
that that division has shrunk to not
 
01:35:59.199 --> 01:36:00.550 align:start position:0%
that that division has shrunk to not
um

01:36:00.550 --> 01:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:03.669 --> 01:36:03.679 align:start position:0%
sort of a skeleton crew
 
01:36:04.629 --> 01:36:04.639 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks for your question
 
01:36:05.910 --> 01:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
representative and
 
01:36:09.750 --> 01:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh you know who knows the future right
 
01:36:11.270 --> 01:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
i will say this
 
01:36:13.910 --> 01:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
that the fund will have a immediate
 
01:36:16.229 --> 01:36:16.239 align:start position:0%
purpose now and be useful for the state
 
01:36:17.590 --> 01:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire and that's who i'm
 
01:36:20.790 --> 01:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
interested in the state of new hampshire
 
01:36:22.709 --> 01:36:22.719 align:start position:0%
i do suspect
 
01:36:25.189 --> 01:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
that given the national scope of this
 
01:36:27.990 --> 01:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
problem and its ongoing nature that
 
01:36:30.149 --> 01:36:30.159 align:start position:0%
whatever party may be in control down in
 
01:36:30.159 --> 01:36:31.430 align:start position:0%
whatever party may be in control down in
washington

01:36:31.430 --> 01:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
washington
 
01:36:33.990 --> 01:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
all both members of both parties and you
 
01:36:36.229 --> 01:36:36.239 align:start position:0%
know whoever is president knows
 
01:36:38.470 --> 01:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
that the states are facing these issues
 
01:36:41.910 --> 01:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
so i would expect as in the past and in
 
01:36:43.910 --> 01:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
the future that there will be
 
01:36:45.910 --> 01:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
federal attention and potentially funds
 
01:36:48.550 --> 01:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
for us to apply for but but we don't
 
01:36:50.629 --> 01:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
know but for right now
 
01:36:52.229 --> 01:36:52.239 align:start position:0%
this will help we'll get some money out
 
01:36:53.910 --> 01:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
we'll help some municipalities and
 
01:36:55.830 --> 01:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
businesses and
 
01:36:57.830 --> 01:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
that's to the thank you
 
01:37:00.070 --> 01:37:00.080 align:start position:0%

waters for coming thank you hi i'm back

01:37:12.870 --> 01:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:37:14.149 --> 01:37:14.159 align:start position:0%
on the way
 
01:37:16.950 --> 01:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh so i have a couple of questions um
 
01:37:18.870 --> 01:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
one do you have any idea
 
01:37:22.070 --> 01:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
how much money is anticipated
 
01:37:24.070 --> 01:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
from the federal government for this
 
01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:24.870 align:start position:0%
from the federal government for this
these

01:37:24.870 --> 01:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:37:27.350 --> 01:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
programs and what could potentially
 
01:37:30.070 --> 01:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
be placed into this fund and will we be
 
01:37:31.990 --> 01:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
seeding this fund with anything to begin
 
01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.390 align:start position:0%
seeding this fund with anything to begin
with

01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:36.629 align:start position:0%
with
um

01:37:36.629 --> 01:37:36.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:38.870 --> 01:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to check on my notes is
 
01:37:40.870 --> 01:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
somebody from
 
01:37:42.870 --> 01:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
you're going to talk about it okay thank
 
01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:44.709 align:start position:0%
you're going to talk about it okay thank
you

01:37:44.709 --> 01:37:44.719 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
okay i think there is some idea but i i
 
01:37:48.790 --> 01:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
just have a feeling that
 
01:37:49.990 --> 01:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
i'm going to say the wrong number all
 
01:37:51.830 --> 01:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
right good enough thank you
 
01:37:54.790 --> 01:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
fair enough representative compton
 
01:37:56.310 --> 01:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you senator
 
01:37:57.910 --> 01:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my questions
 
01:38:00.070 --> 01:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
um my question is
 
01:38:01.910 --> 01:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
what type of federal strings will be
 
01:38:05.830 --> 01:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
attached by accepting any of these funds
 
01:38:07.830 --> 01:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
well thanks for your question and um you
 
01:38:09.990 --> 01:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
know what you know funds can be
 
01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
appropriated but then they have to write
 
01:38:14.229 --> 01:38:14.239 align:start position:0%
the regulations for how you can use them
 
01:38:15.510 --> 01:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
and that's pretty typical about
 
01:38:17.109 --> 01:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
everything we get from the federal
 
01:38:18.870 --> 01:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
government there's nothing in this bill
 
01:38:20.950 --> 01:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
that requires us to accept those funds
 
01:38:22.790 --> 01:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
if we think the regulations are
 
01:38:24.229 --> 01:38:24.239 align:start position:0%
inappropriate for
 
01:38:26.070 --> 01:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire and that's also why
 
01:38:29.030 --> 01:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
rulemaking is in here that if we have a
 
01:38:30.870 --> 01:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
certain guard rails on the regulations
 
01:38:32.790 --> 01:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
for receiving the funds the rulemaking
 
01:38:34.950 --> 01:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
can be the process where we figure out
 
01:38:36.550 --> 01:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
how to make that work for
 
01:38:38.310 --> 01:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire thank you do you have
 
01:38:40.229 --> 01:38:40.239 align:start position:0%
time for one more are you sure all right
 
01:38:40.239 --> 01:38:41.510 align:start position:0%
time for one more are you sure all right

chairman uh for the record my name is
 
01:39:23.590 --> 01:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
karen ebel
 
01:39:27.270 --> 01:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
um i represent merrimack district five
 
01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
which is new london and
 
01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:30.550 align:start position:0%
which is new london and
newbury

01:39:30.550 --> 01:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
newbury
 
01:39:33.750 --> 01:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm here in support of
 
01:39:36.149 --> 01:39:36.159 align:start position:0%
sb 379
 
01:39:38.550 --> 01:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
which i'm also a co-sponsor i just want
 
01:39:40.870 --> 01:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
to say it's really uh nice to be back
 
01:39:42.669 --> 01:39:42.679 align:start position:0%
with uh trash
 
01:39:45.430 --> 01:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
aficionados i've been uh talking a lot
 
01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
of trash lately i know you do too so um
 
01:39:53.189 --> 01:39:53.199 align:start position:0%
feels like home again or sort of um
 
01:39:57.189 --> 01:39:57.199 align:start position:0%
so the the basis of this bill is to
 
01:39:58.790 --> 01:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
create a
 
01:40:02.070 --> 01:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
solid waste management fund and i know
 
01:40:04.629 --> 01:40:04.639 align:start position:0%
you just heard the outlines of it from
 
01:40:07.910 --> 01:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
senator waters and i also think you know
 
01:40:09.669 --> 01:40:09.679 align:start position:0%
some of the history but i'll just go
 
01:40:11.510 --> 01:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
through it really quickly and i had more
 
01:40:14.950 --> 01:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
of it in my written testimony
 
01:40:16.270 --> 01:40:16.280 align:start position:0%
through the
 
01:40:19.910 --> 01:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
hb617 recycling and solid waste study
 
01:40:22.709 --> 01:40:22.719 align:start position:0%
committee we analyzed many things
 
01:40:24.870 --> 01:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that really
 
01:40:29.750 --> 01:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
left to the forefront was that a fund
 
01:40:33.109 --> 01:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
was needed or some funding was needed to
 
01:40:35.990 --> 01:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
help des better perform its job in
 
01:40:38.870 --> 01:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
planning and solid waste management and
 
01:40:40.750 --> 01:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
we also needed some help from
 
01:40:42.950 --> 01:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities who were really feeling
 
01:40:44.950 --> 01:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
the impact of having to deal with their
 
01:40:48.470 --> 01:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
trash in a in a global economy that as
 
01:40:51.270 --> 01:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
you know china stopped taking a lot of
 
01:40:53.750 --> 01:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
the plastics and mixed paper and there
 
01:40:56.310 --> 01:40:56.320 align:start position:0%
was just a lot of confusion and turmoil
 
01:40:57.990 --> 01:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
out there
 
01:41:00.470 --> 01:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
many things have happened since 2019
 
01:41:03.350 --> 01:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
when we first did that recycling
 
01:41:05.350 --> 01:41:05.360 align:start position:0%
study committee there's now a huge
 
01:41:07.830 --> 01:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
amount of focus on solid waste which is
 
01:41:09.510 --> 01:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
a good thing because i think it's been
 
01:41:11.669 --> 01:41:11.679 align:start position:0%
neglected for too long
 
01:41:14.229 --> 01:41:14.239 align:start position:0%
and a lot has also happened
 
01:41:16.310 --> 01:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
we have established new solid waste
 
01:41:19.590 --> 01:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
diversion goals we have a long range
 
01:41:22.470 --> 01:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
solid waste plan which we're promised
 
01:41:25.990 --> 01:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
will be available to us on october 1st
 
01:41:27.830 --> 01:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
and we know that that hasn't been
 
01:41:30.390 --> 01:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
prepared since 2003
 
01:41:33.350 --> 01:41:33.360 align:start position:0%
we have a reorganization in des that
 
01:41:37.270 --> 01:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
includes now um two planning folks one
 
01:41:39.669 --> 01:41:39.679 align:start position:0%
just joined yesterday
 
01:41:42.470 --> 01:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
and we also have formed the solid waste
 
01:41:45.030 --> 01:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
working group of which i am a cha i'm
 
01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
the chair and uh representative pearl is
 
01:41:50.310 --> 01:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
a member
 
01:41:53.669 --> 01:41:53.679 align:start position:0%
there's a renewed focus on landfilling
 
01:41:55.510 --> 01:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
and more and more people have come to
 
01:41:57.270 --> 01:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
understand that as far as the private
 
01:41:59.590 --> 01:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
landfills are concerned at least half of
 
01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:00.629 align:start position:0%
landfills are concerned at least half of
the

01:42:00.629 --> 01:42:00.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:42:03.189 --> 01:42:03.199 align:start position:0%
solid waste coming into the state is
 
01:42:06.470 --> 01:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:08.229 --> 01:42:08.239 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of study committees
 
01:42:10.070 --> 01:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
being formed so we know that there's a
 
01:42:11.750 --> 01:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
lot of interest
 
01:42:13.750 --> 01:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
but at some point
 
01:42:16.310 --> 01:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
very soon and i'd like to say now the
 
01:42:18.470 --> 01:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
rubber is going to hit the road
 
01:42:20.550 --> 01:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
actions are going to have to be taken
 
01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:21.830 align:start position:0%
actions are going to have to be taken
that

01:42:21.830 --> 01:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:42:24.310 --> 01:42:24.320 align:start position:0%
you know sometimes we're slow to take in
 
01:42:26.470 --> 01:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire we have to
 
01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
stop saying no to some of these actions
 
01:42:32.229 --> 01:42:32.239 align:start position:0%
things that include funding things that
 
01:42:34.870 --> 01:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
include potentially
 
01:42:37.270 --> 01:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
some requirements waistbands there's all
 
01:42:39.270 --> 01:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
sorts of things but if you're going to
 
01:42:41.430 --> 01:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
meet your solid waste diversion goals
 
01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
which we adopted wholeheartedly here in
 
01:42:47.189 --> 01:42:47.199 align:start position:0%
the legislature and the governor signed
 
01:42:48.950 --> 01:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to do things and one
 
01:42:51.030 --> 01:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
of the things that's going to be very
 
01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:52.229 align:start position:0%
of the things that's going to be very
important

01:42:52.229 --> 01:42:52.239 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:42:54.070 --> 01:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
is to
 
01:42:57.430 --> 01:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
start to create funding that can help
 
01:43:00.470 --> 01:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
support infrastructure so that if you
 
01:43:03.430 --> 01:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
really uh renew your focus on renew
 
01:43:07.510 --> 01:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
reuse and recycling there are facilities
 
01:43:09.590 --> 01:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
to recycle
 
01:43:12.629 --> 01:43:12.639 align:start position:0%
so one of the goals of this solid waste
 
01:43:15.750 --> 01:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
management fund is to
 
01:43:17.910 --> 01:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
help support the development of the
 
01:43:20.709 --> 01:43:20.719 align:start position:0%
infrastructure among other things to
 
01:43:23.430 --> 01:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
support municipalities doing a better
 
01:43:27.109 --> 01:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
job recycling expanding their recycling
 
01:43:27.119 --> 01:43:28.790 align:start position:0%
job recycling expanding their recycling
capabilities

01:43:28.790 --> 01:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
capabilities
 
01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:29.910 align:start position:0%
capabilities
and

01:43:29.910 --> 01:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:43:33.189 --> 01:43:33.199 align:start position:0%
all these things will take money now
 
01:43:35.350 --> 01:43:35.360 align:start position:0%
i just was at a conference and i just
 
01:43:37.669 --> 01:43:37.679 align:start position:0%
want to mention this because you're the
 
01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
you're the um
 
01:43:41.350 --> 01:43:41.360 align:start position:0%
committee where a lot of these measures
 
01:43:43.830 --> 01:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
are going to be discussed i mean the the
 
01:43:45.830 --> 01:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
solid waste working group and all these
 
01:43:47.430 --> 01:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
study committees can make a lot of
 
01:43:47.440 --> 01:43:49.189 align:start position:0%
study committees can make a lot of
recommendations

01:43:49.189 --> 01:43:49.199 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
01:43:52.149 --> 01:43:52.159 align:start position:0%
but it's going to have to take a lot of
 
01:43:55.109 --> 01:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
policy willpower to put these things
 
01:43:57.030 --> 01:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
into um
 
01:43:59.510 --> 01:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
into being so at this conference we were
 
01:44:01.270 --> 01:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
talking about the chicken and the egg
 
01:44:05.990 --> 01:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
theory do you require recycling do you
 
01:44:08.390 --> 01:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
ban c and d
 
01:44:11.189 --> 01:44:11.199 align:start position:0%
from going into a landfill unless it's
 
01:44:14.310 --> 01:44:14.320 align:start position:0%
15 percent recycled like some states are
 
01:44:16.149 --> 01:44:16.159 align:start position:0%
doing do you ban
 
01:44:19.990 --> 01:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
mattresses from going into landfills and
 
01:44:22.709 --> 01:44:22.719 align:start position:0%
where's the recycling capability what's
 
01:44:24.870 --> 01:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
the chicken in the egg can you ban it
 
01:44:26.629 --> 01:44:26.639 align:start position:0%
and hope that the infrastructure will
 
01:44:29.189 --> 01:44:29.199 align:start position:0%
develop or do you develop the
 
01:44:32.390 --> 01:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and then institute the
 
01:44:34.070 --> 01:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
ban probably the way these things are
 
01:44:35.270 --> 01:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
going to happen is they're going to
 
01:44:38.310 --> 01:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
happen together and we're going to need
 
01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:39.109 align:start position:0%
happen together and we're going to need
some

01:44:39.109 --> 01:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:44:40.950 --> 01:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
stimulus funding
 
01:44:45.350 --> 01:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
to help those get going well fortunately
 
01:44:47.590 --> 01:44:47.600 align:start position:0%
the federal government has recognized
 
01:44:51.030 --> 01:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
this and in the last um the the
 
01:44:53.270 --> 01:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
infrastructure bill
 
01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:54.229 align:start position:0%
infrastructure bill
and

01:44:54.229 --> 01:44:54.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:44:56.709 --> 01:44:56.719 align:start position:0%
director wimsat is here so i but i hope
 
01:44:58.629 --> 01:44:58.639 align:start position:0%
i have my numbers straight i understand
 
01:45:00.870 --> 01:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
that there's 275
 
01:45:02.550 --> 01:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
million dollars that's being
 
01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:04.149 align:start position:0%
million dollars that's being
appropriated

01:45:04.149 --> 01:45:04.159 align:start position:0%
appropriated
 
01:45:06.950 --> 01:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
for uh recycling and
 
01:45:09.109 --> 01:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
solid waste efforts which i think is
 
01:45:11.990 --> 01:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
fantastic news at this conference the
 
01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.310 align:start position:0%
fantastic news at this conference the
epa

01:45:14.310 --> 01:45:14.320 align:start position:0%
epa
 
01:45:17.189 --> 01:45:17.199 align:start position:0%
representative said that in her career
 
01:45:20.310 --> 01:45:20.320 align:start position:0%
she's never seen this much money come
 
01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
forward for solid waste efforts uh she
 
01:45:26.950 --> 01:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
said that 55 million dollars per year is
 
01:45:31.109 --> 01:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
going to be appropriated and the
 
01:45:32.870 --> 01:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
states can
 
01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:34.149 align:start position:0%
states can
request

01:45:34.149 --> 01:45:34.159 align:start position:0%
request
 
01:45:36.070 --> 01:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
grants and there was a question about
 
01:45:38.470 --> 01:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
strings attached any grant you know you
 
01:45:40.870 --> 01:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
request there will be certain
 
01:45:43.510 --> 01:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
requirements in order for you to get the
 
01:45:45.669 --> 01:45:45.679 align:start position:0%
grant so you'll have to fulfill those so
 
01:45:48.149 --> 01:45:48.159 align:start position:0%
it depends on what you're asking for but
 
01:45:49.669 --> 01:45:49.679 align:start position:0%
the other
 
01:45:51.430 --> 01:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
exciting news that the epa
 
01:45:54.790 --> 01:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
representative shared was that included
 
01:45:56.390 --> 01:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
in that funding
 
01:45:59.510 --> 01:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
every state will definitely get
 
01:46:03.030 --> 01:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
some amount of money for solid waste
 
01:46:05.910 --> 01:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
efforts and she wasn't really able to
 
01:46:08.870 --> 01:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
say exactly how much that money would be
 
01:46:11.430 --> 01:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
so we know right out of the block
 
01:46:14.229 --> 01:46:14.239 align:start position:0%
we should be able to get federal funding
 
01:46:16.149 --> 01:46:16.159 align:start position:0%
for this solid waste
 
01:46:19.030 --> 01:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
management fund
 
01:46:21.270 --> 01:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
i would be remiss if i didn't say that
 
01:46:23.590 --> 01:46:23.600 align:start position:0%
the recommendation for the solid waste
 
01:46:25.990 --> 01:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
management fund did come out of the hb
 
01:46:28.870 --> 01:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
617 study committee and initially we
 
01:46:30.709 --> 01:46:30.719 align:start position:0%
were talking about a solid waste
 
01:46:33.750 --> 01:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
dispersal uh disposal surcharge on
 
01:46:37.750 --> 01:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
tipping um costs so for every ton that
 
01:46:39.750 --> 01:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
you put in a landfill
 
01:46:42.030 --> 01:46:42.040 align:start position:0%
in the original version of the bill
 
01:46:45.910 --> 01:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
1.50 would have to be paid and that was
 
01:46:48.390 --> 01:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
going to be one of the funding sources
 
01:46:50.950 --> 01:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
with response to you representative
 
01:46:50.960 --> 01:46:52.229 align:start position:0%
with response to you representative
bixby

01:46:52.229 --> 01:46:52.239 align:start position:0%
bixby
 
01:46:56.950 --> 01:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
for this fund and it would help create a
 
01:46:59.030 --> 01:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
grant program
 
01:47:01.590 --> 01:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
to go back to municipalities but as far
 
01:47:04.709 --> 01:47:04.719 align:start position:0%
as out of state waste was concerned
 
01:47:07.430 --> 01:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
our municipalities would get it back but
 
01:47:09.990 --> 01:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
out of state waste wouldn't necessarily
 
01:47:11.910 --> 01:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh the the people who dumped it wouldn't
 
01:47:14.149 --> 01:47:14.159 align:start position:0%
get it back that has been removed from
 
01:47:15.350 --> 01:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:47:17.189 --> 01:47:17.199 align:start position:0%
in the original amendment that was in
 
01:47:19.510 --> 01:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
the senate five hundred thousand dollar
 
01:47:21.910 --> 01:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
appropriation was put in the bill that
 
01:47:25.109 --> 01:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
was removed by finance
 
01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
the governor was opposed to the
 
01:47:29.030 --> 01:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
surcharge but he did say that if we
 
01:47:31.030 --> 01:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
needed funding there was plenty of
 
01:47:33.669 --> 01:47:33.679 align:start position:0%
surplus and that
 
01:47:36.550 --> 01:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
we should be able to put some money in
 
01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:38.070 align:start position:0%
we should be able to put some money in
for

01:47:38.070 --> 01:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:47:40.390 --> 01:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
for seed money for this but at this
 
01:47:41.910 --> 01:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
point there's no money in it you're
 
01:47:43.830 --> 01:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
right and i'm just going to reiterate
 
01:47:46.149 --> 01:47:46.159 align:start position:0%
what i said before at some point the
 
01:47:48.550 --> 01:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
rubber is going to meet the road here
 
01:47:50.629 --> 01:47:50.639 align:start position:0%
and we're going to have to take some
 
01:47:52.709 --> 01:47:52.719 align:start position:0%
actions that we don't always like to
 
01:47:54.870 --> 01:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
take in the state of new hampshire
 
01:47:57.030 --> 01:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
otherwise our landfills are going to
 
01:47:59.830 --> 01:47:59.840 align:start position:0%
continue to be brimming and we're going
 
01:48:03.910 --> 01:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
to have to accept out-of-state waste
 
01:48:05.990 --> 01:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
because we may have to build new
 
01:48:09.109 --> 01:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
landfills to accept everything so
 
01:48:11.430 --> 01:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
i would encourage this committee to
 
01:48:14.149 --> 01:48:14.159 align:start position:0%
recommend passage of this fund as a way
 
01:48:16.310 --> 01:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
of helping us accomplish goals that we
 
01:48:18.709 --> 01:48:18.719 align:start position:0%
really need to accomplish in the state
 
01:48:21.830 --> 01:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
and i'd be happy to take any questions
 
01:48:23.590 --> 01:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any questions
 
01:48:25.830 --> 01:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative murray
 
01:48:27.669 --> 01:48:27.679 align:start position:0%
hi thank you mr chair for taking my
 
01:48:29.510 --> 01:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
question thank you representative evil
 
01:48:31.990 --> 01:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
um so my question is actually around
 
01:48:34.550 --> 01:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
shared waste disposal districts and
 
01:48:37.750 --> 01:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea of how those might
 
01:48:37.760 --> 01:48:38.870 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea of how those might
um

01:48:38.870 --> 01:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:40.390 --> 01:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
would this be worked out in rules like
 
01:48:42.550 --> 01:48:42.560 align:start position:0%
how how would they potentially apply for
 
01:48:44.870 --> 01:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
some of these things well i think that's
 
01:48:47.030 --> 01:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
probably a question for direct director
 
01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:48.870 align:start position:0%
probably a question for direct director
wimsat

01:48:48.870 --> 01:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
wimsat
 
01:48:51.830 --> 01:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
and i think we have to see also what the
 
01:48:54.950 --> 01:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
federal requirements are and and how all
 
01:48:57.430 --> 01:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
that will work but you know we do talk a
 
01:48:59.669 --> 01:48:59.679 align:start position:0%
lot about municipalities but of course
 
01:49:02.470 --> 01:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
one really important
 
01:49:04.310 --> 01:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
entity in the state of new hampshire is
 
01:49:07.590 --> 01:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
the solid waste district and we want to
 
01:49:09.750 --> 01:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
make sure to support those
 
01:49:11.750 --> 01:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
and interestingly as you know
 
01:49:14.470 --> 01:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities solid waste districts
 
01:49:16.790 --> 01:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
they are not subject to the interstate
 
01:49:19.109 --> 01:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
commerce clause so they have control
 
01:49:22.790 --> 01:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
over the waste that they that they um
 
01:49:24.629 --> 01:49:24.639 align:start position:0%
can take
 
01:49:27.430 --> 01:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative bixby
 
01:49:28.470 --> 01:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman thank you
 
01:49:30.709 --> 01:49:30.719 align:start position:0%
representative ebel um
 
01:49:32.870 --> 01:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
so i have a question
 
01:49:32.880 --> 01:49:33.669 align:start position:0%
so i have a question
that

01:49:33.669 --> 01:49:33.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:49:34.950 --> 01:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
gets to
 
01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:36.709 align:start position:0%
gets to
um

01:49:36.709 --> 01:49:36.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:41.750 --> 01:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
it's on line 10 of page two
 
01:49:43.589 --> 01:49:43.599 align:start position:0%
administration of solid waste management
 
01:49:45.550 --> 01:49:45.560 align:start position:0%
fund rsa
 
01:49:48.229 --> 01:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
149 m6
 
01:49:51.510 --> 01:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh 11 is repealed and reenacted as
 
01:49:54.790 --> 01:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
follows and i um
 
01:49:59.030 --> 01:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
took the liberty of looking up what uh
 
01:50:03.270 --> 01:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
149 m611 roman 11 is
 
01:50:06.310 --> 01:50:06.320 align:start position:0%
and it is a an existing one dollar
 
01:50:09.589 --> 01:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
surcharge on out of waste state a one
 
01:50:13.669 --> 01:50:13.679 align:start position:0%
dollar per ton surcharge on out of waste
 
01:50:16.790 --> 01:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
out of state solid waste
 
01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
and so what is the history of that
 
01:50:21.589 --> 01:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
surcharge and um
 
01:50:23.669 --> 01:50:23.679 align:start position:0%
i i kind of understand with the current
 
01:50:25.430 --> 01:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
intent why it's being removed but what's
 
01:50:27.189 --> 01:50:27.199 align:start position:0%
the history of that surcharge
 
01:50:29.910 --> 01:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
well um i will tell you what i've
 
01:50:31.910 --> 01:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
learned because i've learned oh so many
 
01:50:33.830 --> 01:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
things about solid waste in the last
 
01:50:37.589 --> 01:50:37.599 align:start position:0%
several years but you know the um
 
01:50:40.390 --> 01:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
the issue of the state of new hampshire
 
01:50:43.109 --> 01:50:43.119 align:start position:0%
accepting out-of-state waste has been
 
01:50:45.430 --> 01:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
out there for a really long time
 
01:50:48.149 --> 01:50:48.159 align:start position:0%
and there was an attempt
 
01:50:52.629 --> 01:50:52.639 align:start position:0%
to place a fee on just of state waste in
 
01:50:55.790 --> 01:50:55.800 align:start position:0%
the statutes but no sooner did the
 
01:50:59.270 --> 01:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
legislature pass it then
 
01:51:01.510 --> 01:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
we were told by the attorney general
 
01:51:06.709 --> 01:51:06.719 align:start position:0%
that it's illegal to only put a fee on
 
01:51:09.270 --> 01:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
out of state waste and it's been
 
01:51:11.109 --> 01:51:11.119 align:start position:0%
lingering there
 
01:51:13.109 --> 01:51:13.119 align:start position:0%
hopefully no
 
01:51:17.030 --> 01:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
in our in our statutes um and uh in an
 
01:51:18.950 --> 01:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
effort to sort of clear the books of
 
01:51:22.629 --> 01:51:22.639 align:start position:0%
things that aren't really legal
 
01:51:22.639 --> 01:51:23.750 align:start position:0%
things that aren't really legal
the

01:51:23.750 --> 01:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:51:26.070 --> 01:51:26.080 align:start position:0%
we went ahead and put the repeal of that
 
01:51:28.550 --> 01:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
statute in this bill
 
01:51:29.589 --> 01:51:29.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:51:31.109 --> 01:51:31.119 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
01:51:32.870 --> 01:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none what we think do
 
01:51:34.070 --> 01:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
we have one representative control i'm
 
01:51:35.589 --> 01:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
sorry i didn't see you
 
01:51:37.030 --> 01:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
01:51:39.109 --> 01:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
01:51:39.119 --> 01:51:39.830 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
um

01:51:39.830 --> 01:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:41.830 --> 01:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
just want to go into a little bit more
 
01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:42.870 align:start position:0%
just want to go into a little bit more
depth

01:51:42.870 --> 01:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
depth
 
01:51:44.470 --> 01:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
regarding out-of-state waste and
 
01:51:44.480 --> 01:51:47.109 align:start position:0%
regarding out-of-state waste and
municipalities

01:51:47.109 --> 01:51:47.119 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:51:48.629 --> 01:51:48.639 align:start position:0%
can you explain
 
01:51:51.910 --> 01:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
um right now it's we have to accept
 
01:51:55.430 --> 01:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
out-of-state waste is that correct
 
01:51:58.070 --> 01:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
well stated in the reverse you can't ban
 
01:51:58.080 --> 01:51:59.030 align:start position:0%
well stated in the reverse you can't ban
it

01:51:59.030 --> 01:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:52:02.229 --> 01:52:02.239 align:start position:0%
right so if you're a private landfill
 
01:52:05.109 --> 01:52:05.119 align:start position:0%
you don't have to accept it but we can't
 
01:52:07.270 --> 01:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
ban it under the interstate commerce
 
01:52:10.149 --> 01:52:10.159 align:start position:0%
close clause follow it please thank you
 
01:52:10.159 --> 01:52:11.830 align:start position:0%
close clause follow it please thank you
um

01:52:11.830 --> 01:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:11.840 --> 01:52:12.709 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:52:12.709 --> 01:52:12.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:52:15.109 --> 01:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
when you talked about like there is like
 
01:52:17.510 --> 01:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
municipal you know solid waste districts
 
01:52:19.270 --> 01:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
where there's like four towns that get
 
01:52:22.470 --> 01:52:22.480 align:start position:0%
together um they can control um out of
 
01:52:25.430 --> 01:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
state but individual
 
01:52:28.629 --> 01:52:28.639 align:start position:0%
uh cannot is that my understanding
 
01:52:28.639 --> 01:52:29.510 align:start position:0%
uh cannot is that my understanding
yeah

01:52:29.510 --> 01:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:52:30.629 --> 01:52:30.639 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:52:32.470 --> 01:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
on more sure yeah so
 
01:52:32.480 --> 01:52:33.270 align:start position:0%
on more sure yeah so
with

01:52:33.270 --> 01:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:52:36.149 --> 01:52:36.159 align:start position:0%
this funding coming in is there is is
 
01:52:38.229 --> 01:52:38.239 align:start position:0%
part of it to help
 
01:52:39.830 --> 01:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
prohibit out-of-state waste from coming
 
01:52:41.589 --> 01:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
into the state is
 
01:52:45.830 --> 01:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
there any intention in this for that um
 
01:52:45.840 --> 01:52:48.950 align:start position:0%
there any intention in this for that um
well

01:52:48.950 --> 01:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:51.669 --> 01:52:51.679 align:start position:0%
so the thing is if you're going to
 
01:52:53.270 --> 01:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
just this is going to be a little bit of
 
01:52:56.390 --> 01:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
a long answer but if you're going to
 
01:52:56.400 --> 01:52:57.589 align:start position:0%
a long answer but if you're going to
um

01:52:57.589 --> 01:52:57.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:00.550 --> 01:53:00.560 align:start position:0%
try to meet your diversion goals
 
01:53:03.270 --> 01:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
one of the things that you can do and
 
01:53:05.910 --> 01:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
what a lot of states do in fact we have
 
01:53:07.910 --> 01:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
a couple on our books we don't allow
 
01:53:09.990 --> 01:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
leaf and yard waste for instance in our
 
01:53:12.790 --> 01:53:12.800 align:start position:0%
landfills but if for instance you wanted
 
01:53:14.950 --> 01:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
to institute
 
01:53:17.350 --> 01:53:17.360 align:start position:0%
a waistband on mattresses and it's the
 
01:53:19.030 --> 01:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
second time i've mentioned them because
 
01:53:20.870 --> 01:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
i've learned that that you know during
 
01:53:22.950 --> 01:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
covet everybody wanted to replace their
 
01:53:24.870 --> 01:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
mattress and they're just like filling
 
01:53:28.070 --> 01:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
up the landfills but you couldn't like
 
01:53:31.189 --> 01:53:31.199 align:start position:0%
say all right our our
 
01:53:34.390 --> 01:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
landfills can only accept new hampshire
 
01:53:38.229 --> 01:53:38.239 align:start position:0%
based mattresses you know you can't
 
01:53:38.239 --> 01:53:39.030 align:start position:0%
based mattresses you know you can't
so

01:53:39.030 --> 01:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:53:41.350 --> 01:53:41.360 align:start position:0%
what you would do is
 
01:53:43.990 --> 01:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
you could institute a waistband
 
01:53:46.470 --> 01:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
you could use some of the monies that
 
01:53:48.310 --> 01:53:48.320 align:start position:0%
are in this fund
 
01:53:51.589 --> 01:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
to try to develop a recycling program
 
01:53:53.270 --> 01:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
for mattresses
 
01:53:56.070 --> 01:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
and in that way you would be achieving
 
01:53:56.080 --> 01:53:57.350 align:start position:0%
and in that way you would be achieving
your

01:53:57.350 --> 01:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:54:00.390 --> 01:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
your diversion goal without outrightly
 
01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:02.070 align:start position:0%
your diversion goal without outrightly
banning

01:54:02.070 --> 01:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
banning
 
01:54:04.629 --> 01:54:04.639 align:start position:0%
out of state mattresses
 
01:54:07.669 --> 01:54:07.679 align:start position:0%
but the effect might be overall
 
01:54:09.750 --> 01:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
you're decreasing the amount of
 
01:54:12.149 --> 01:54:12.159 align:start position:0%
out-of-state mattresses that end up in
 
01:54:16.070 --> 01:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:17.510 --> 01:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
i hope that helps
 
01:54:17.520 --> 01:54:19.109 align:start position:0%
i hope that helps
okay

01:54:19.109 --> 01:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:54:20.950 --> 01:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
seeing no more questions we appreciate
 
01:54:22.709 --> 01:54:22.719 align:start position:0%
your testimony and
 
01:54:26.390 --> 01:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
well thank you for all your uh hard work
 
01:54:28.870 --> 01:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
next we'll have uh nat grays from the
 
01:54:33.350 --> 01:54:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:34.790 --> 01:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
welcome to ena
 
01:54:36.709 --> 01:54:36.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair nate grace for the
 
01:54:38.870 --> 01:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire municipal association
 
01:54:40.470 --> 01:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
it might surprise you all to learn that
 
01:54:43.990 --> 01:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
we support this bill um it would uh
 
01:54:47.109 --> 01:54:47.119 align:start position:0%
obviously assist municipalities quite a
 
01:54:47.119 --> 01:54:48.390 align:start position:0%
obviously assist municipalities quite a
lot

01:54:48.390 --> 01:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
lot
 
01:54:50.149 --> 01:54:50.159 align:start position:0%
you know we don't have exact numbers on
 
01:54:51.750 --> 01:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
what type of federal funding would be
 
01:54:54.149 --> 01:54:54.159 align:start position:0%
available or how exactly the rules would
 
01:54:56.390 --> 01:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
work out um
 
01:54:58.310 --> 01:54:58.320 align:start position:0%
i believe that director wimsett would
 
01:55:00.629 --> 01:55:00.639 align:start position:0%
would have uh probably a better
 
01:55:02.870 --> 01:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
knowledge of that than i would
 
01:55:05.430 --> 01:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
but we do understand that you know we
 
01:55:07.510 --> 01:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
need a multi-faceted solution to the
 
01:55:09.109 --> 01:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
landfill problem
 
01:55:10.229 --> 01:55:10.239 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
01:55:13.189 --> 01:55:13.199 align:start position:0%
we are committed to working with des and
 
01:55:14.950 --> 01:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
all of our partners in the state to try
 
01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:15.669 align:start position:0%
all of our partners in the state to try
to

01:55:15.669 --> 01:55:15.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:55:18.310 --> 01:55:18.320 align:start position:0%
come to a solution that works as the
 
01:55:19.750 --> 01:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
committee's already recognized you know
 
01:55:21.750 --> 01:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
there are some hurdles with things like
 
01:55:24.229 --> 01:55:24.239 align:start position:0%
the interstate commerce clause
 
01:55:26.229 --> 01:55:26.239 align:start position:0%
that that do cause some issues in our
 
01:55:27.669 --> 01:55:27.679 align:start position:0%
ability to
 
01:55:27.679 --> 01:55:29.030 align:start position:0%
ability to
um

01:55:29.030 --> 01:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:31.750 --> 01:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
deal with the landfill capacity issue
 
01:55:33.270 --> 01:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
this bill in particular would provide a
 
01:55:36.070 --> 01:55:36.080 align:start position:0%
mechanism to help help municipalities
 
01:55:37.830 --> 01:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
deal with existing issues as well as
 
01:55:39.589 --> 01:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
future issues
 
01:55:41.910 --> 01:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
as senator waters mentioned
 
01:55:44.390 --> 01:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
would allow municipalities potentially
 
01:55:46.870 --> 01:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
to purchase things that are often very
 
01:55:48.950 --> 01:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
expensive for small municipalities with
 
01:55:50.709 --> 01:55:50.719 align:start position:0%
transfer stations to purchase such as
 
01:55:52.550 --> 01:55:52.560 align:start position:0%
skid loaders etc
 
01:55:53.990 --> 01:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
by providing
 
01:55:55.910 --> 01:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
matching grants depending on exactly
 
01:55:57.990 --> 01:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
what what rules are
 
01:56:00.310 --> 01:56:00.320 align:start position:0%
formulated here it would also serve to
 
01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:01.510 align:start position:0%
formulated here it would also serve to
help

01:56:01.510 --> 01:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
help
 
01:56:04.629 --> 01:56:04.639 align:start position:0%
both municipalities and
 
01:56:07.030 --> 01:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
our our partners in the private industry
 
01:56:09.669 --> 01:56:09.679 align:start position:0%
world innovate to
 
01:56:12.550 --> 01:56:12.560 align:start position:0%
better reduce the amount of solid waste
 
01:56:15.109 --> 01:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
go into landfills which as we've learned
 
01:56:19.510 --> 01:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
through a very lengthy process so far
 
01:56:21.750 --> 01:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
evaluating the the state landfill
 
01:56:23.910 --> 01:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
capacity is something that will likely
 
01:56:26.629 --> 01:56:26.639 align:start position:0%
become much more expensive and affect
 
01:56:28.629 --> 01:56:28.639 align:start position:0%
municipalities and of course their
 
01:56:28.639 --> 01:56:29.910 align:start position:0%
municipalities and of course their
citizens

01:56:29.910 --> 01:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
01:56:31.030 --> 01:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions the
 
01:56:32.149 --> 01:56:32.159 align:start position:0%
committee has
 
01:56:35.750 --> 01:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:35.760 --> 01:56:36.709 align:start position:0%
 
see

01:56:36.709 --> 01:56:36.719 align:start position:0%
see
 
01:56:38.229 --> 01:56:38.239 align:start position:0%
representative stapleton
 
01:56:39.669 --> 01:56:39.679 align:start position:0%
representative muller could you grab the
 
01:56:41.430 --> 01:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
blue sheet for me
 
01:56:43.430 --> 01:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:56:45.270 --> 01:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:56:47.990 --> 01:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
i noticed in a previous testimony
 
01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.149 align:start position:0%
i noticed in a previous testimony
submission

01:56:50.149 --> 01:56:50.159 align:start position:0%
submission
 
01:56:54.709 --> 01:56:54.719 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's tipping fee is 80 a ton
 
01:56:58.109 --> 01:56:58.119 align:start position:0%
to the landfill relative to
 
01:57:02.709 --> 01:57:02.719 align:start position:0%
122 a ton massachusetts 116 vermont and
 
01:57:05.669 --> 01:57:05.679 align:start position:0%
100 a ton in rhode island so it's no
 
01:57:08.310 --> 01:57:08.320 align:start position:0%
wonder we have a lot of
 
01:57:11.109 --> 01:57:11.119 align:start position:0%
uh out of state coming in here
 
01:57:11.119 --> 01:57:12.550 align:start position:0%
uh out of state coming in here
and

01:57:12.550 --> 01:57:12.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:57:14.070 --> 01:57:14.080 align:start position:0%
to my way of thinking it sounds like
 
01:57:16.070 --> 01:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
we're being gamed but
 
01:57:16.080 --> 01:57:17.189 align:start position:0%
we're being gamed but
could

01:57:17.189 --> 01:57:17.199 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:57:19.589 --> 01:57:19.599 align:start position:0%
the municipalities and towns in new
 
01:57:22.709 --> 01:57:22.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire sustain a higher than 80
 
01:57:24.470 --> 01:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
dollars a ton landfill
 
01:57:27.270 --> 01:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
to discourage or at least equalize to
 
01:57:30.790 --> 01:57:30.800 align:start position:0%
the out of state the other state's fees
 
01:57:33.830 --> 01:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
so one of the issues that comes up with
 
01:57:35.589 --> 01:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
tipping fees of course is that they're
 
01:57:38.470 --> 01:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
going to apply universally so we are
 
01:57:41.910 --> 01:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
cheaper tipping fee than many other
 
01:57:41.920 --> 01:57:43.109 align:start position:0%
cheaper tipping fee than many other
states

01:57:43.109 --> 01:57:43.119 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:57:45.830 --> 01:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
which makes our state more attractive to
 
01:57:47.990 --> 01:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
those waste operators to ship
 
01:57:50.390 --> 01:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
materials here but at the same time it's
 
01:57:52.629 --> 01:57:52.639 align:start position:0%
also the fee that our citizens pay
 
01:57:54.229 --> 01:57:54.239 align:start position:0%
so there's a balancing act that the
 
01:57:55.830 --> 01:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
legislature has to do in determining
 
01:57:57.830 --> 01:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
what the appropriate amount is and
 
01:57:59.270 --> 01:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
versus um
 
01:58:00.870 --> 01:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
how attractive that will be to
 
01:58:03.669 --> 01:58:03.679 align:start position:0%
out-of-state um
 
01:58:03.679 --> 01:58:05.430 align:start position:0%
out-of-state um
waste

01:58:05.430 --> 01:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
waste
 
01:58:05.440 --> 01:58:07.189 align:start position:0%
waste
up

01:58:07.189 --> 01:58:07.199 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:58:09.350 --> 01:58:09.360 align:start position:0%
what i was getting at there is there
 
01:58:11.189 --> 01:58:11.199 align:start position:0%
room for
 
01:58:11.199 --> 01:58:12.310 align:start position:0%
room for
raising

01:58:12.310 --> 01:58:12.320 align:start position:0%
raising
 
01:58:15.589 --> 01:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire tipping fee without
 
01:58:17.910 --> 01:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
hurting the municipalities and towns
 
01:58:20.390 --> 01:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
that uh really need
 
01:58:23.030 --> 01:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
an advantage is there a balancing figure
 
01:58:24.550 --> 01:58:24.560 align:start position:0%
there someplace have you ever talked
 
01:58:27.189 --> 01:58:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:28.709 --> 01:58:28.719 align:start position:0%
that's really a policy decision that
 
01:58:30.709 --> 01:58:30.719 align:start position:0%
goes beyond what we would we would
 
01:58:32.310 --> 01:58:32.320 align:start position:0%
advocate for at the municipal
 
01:58:32.320 --> 01:58:33.589 align:start position:0%
advocate for at the municipal
association

01:58:33.589 --> 01:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
association
 
01:58:34.870 --> 01:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:58:36.550 --> 01:58:36.560 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
 
01:58:36.560 --> 01:58:38.149 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative

01:58:38.149 --> 01:58:38.159 align:start position:0%
murray
 
01:58:39.510 --> 01:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair for taking my
 
01:58:41.109 --> 01:58:41.119 align:start position:0%
question and thank you for taking my
 
01:58:41.119 --> 01:58:42.070 align:start position:0%
question and thank you for taking my
question

01:58:42.070 --> 01:58:42.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:58:42.080 --> 01:58:43.430 align:start position:0%
question
historically

01:58:43.430 --> 01:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
historically
 
01:58:44.870 --> 01:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
the tipping fees have increased
 
01:58:47.109 --> 01:58:47.119 align:start position:0%
exponentially over the last several
 
01:58:49.109 --> 01:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
years could you speak a little bit to
 
01:58:49.119 --> 01:58:51.109 align:start position:0%
years could you speak a little bit to
that

01:58:51.109 --> 01:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:58:53.830 --> 01:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not as knowledgeable as
 
01:58:55.430 --> 01:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
some of the people behind me are about
 
01:58:58.149 --> 01:58:58.159 align:start position:0%
that but to the extent that i understand
 
01:58:58.159 --> 01:58:59.350 align:start position:0%
that but to the extent that i understand
it

01:58:59.350 --> 01:58:59.360 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:59:00.229 --> 01:59:00.239 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:59:03.270 --> 01:59:03.280 align:start position:0%
back in
 
01:59:06.470 --> 01:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh i think 2018 2019 we saw a pretty big
 
01:59:08.709 --> 01:59:08.719 align:start position:0%
shift in just the way solid waste is
 
01:59:10.149 --> 01:59:10.159 align:start position:0%
managed because
 
01:59:13.830 --> 01:59:13.840 align:start position:0%
um for example china shut off a lot of
 
01:59:16.950 --> 01:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
imports of waste that were coming from
 
01:59:19.669 --> 01:59:19.679 align:start position:0%
the united states as well as elsewhere
 
01:59:21.510 --> 01:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
and all of these things are
 
01:59:23.589 --> 01:59:23.599 align:start position:0%
really on an international economy and
 
01:59:25.030 --> 01:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
so one of the
 
01:59:27.189 --> 01:59:27.199 align:start position:0%
biggest struggles that municipalities in
 
01:59:29.189 --> 01:59:29.199 align:start position:0%
new hampshire face is you know our
 
01:59:31.750 --> 01:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities average size is under six
 
01:59:33.109 --> 01:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
thousand people
 
01:59:35.350 --> 01:59:35.360 align:start position:0%
and you're trying to deal deal with a
 
01:59:37.510 --> 01:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
whole economy that relates on a global
 
01:59:39.910 --> 01:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
scale so what happens in china indonesia
 
01:59:43.189 --> 01:59:43.199 align:start position:0%
etc is affecting what the costs are here
 
01:59:44.709 --> 01:59:44.719 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
01:59:46.229 --> 01:59:46.239 align:start position:0%
and that's really probably the most
 
01:59:48.790 --> 01:59:48.800 align:start position:0%
difficult thing for us to deal with
 
01:59:50.790 --> 01:59:50.800 align:start position:0%
and why a bill like this is important
 
01:59:53.270 --> 01:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
because it really it really helps us
 
01:59:55.109 --> 01:59:55.119 align:start position:0%
focus on things we can do at the local
 
01:59:57.669 --> 01:59:57.679 align:start position:0%
level to help control costs
 
01:59:59.430 --> 01:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
over the long term
 
02:00:00.950 --> 02:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:00:03.030 --> 02:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
02:00:05.030 --> 02:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none we thank you thank you okay
 
02:00:07.430 --> 02:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
that's the last pink card i have anybody
 
02:00:09.669 --> 02:00:09.679 align:start position:0%
in the audience that wishes to testify
 
02:00:11.589 --> 02:00:11.599 align:start position:0%
representative representative i keep
 
02:00:16.390 --> 02:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:16.400 --> 02:00:16.860 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:00:16.860 --> 02:00:16.870 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:00:16.870 --> 02:00:19.350 align:start position:0%
yes
[Laughter]

02:00:19.350 --> 02:00:19.360 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
02:00:21.750 --> 02:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:00:22.709 --> 02:00:22.719 align:start position:0%
good morning i'm sorry it's a little
 
02:00:24.550 --> 02:00:24.560 align:start position:0%
late so i'll provide a pink card after
 
02:00:26.550 --> 02:00:26.560 align:start position:0%
my testimony for the record my name is
 
02:00:28.310 --> 02:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
mike wimsat i serve as director of the
 
02:00:29.750 --> 02:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
waste management division for the new
 
02:00:31.109 --> 02:00:31.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire department of environmental
 
02:00:31.119 --> 02:00:32.229 align:start position:0%
hampshire department of environmental
services

02:00:32.229 --> 02:00:32.239 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:00:33.830 --> 02:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh pleased to be here to testify and
 
02:00:37.109 --> 02:00:37.119 align:start position:0%
support the senate bill 379.
 
02:00:39.030 --> 02:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
as in a lot has been said here as with
 
02:00:40.550 --> 02:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
the other witnesses so i don't know that
 
02:00:42.310 --> 02:00:42.320 align:start position:0%
i need to spend too much time other than
 
02:00:45.109 --> 02:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
to say that uh des supports this if
 
02:00:47.910 --> 02:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
nothing else it shows a statement by the
 
02:00:50.870 --> 02:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
legislature that it supports des making
 
02:00:53.830 --> 02:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
efforts to try to incentivize recycling
 
02:00:55.750 --> 02:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
and other forms of
 
02:00:57.669 --> 02:00:57.679 align:start position:0%
technology for managing waste other than
 
02:01:00.229 --> 02:01:00.239 align:start position:0%
landfill and incineration
 
02:01:02.790 --> 02:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
by by potentially assuming that we can
 
02:01:04.629 --> 02:01:04.639 align:start position:0%
get funding from the federal government
 
02:01:06.149 --> 02:01:06.159 align:start position:0%
or other sources
 
02:01:08.149 --> 02:01:08.159 align:start position:0%
by providing incentive grants and
 
02:01:09.990 --> 02:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
matching grants to
 
02:01:11.910 --> 02:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities solid waste districts and
 
02:01:14.390 --> 02:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
private industry that will help to
 
02:01:16.149 --> 02:01:16.159 align:start position:0%
advance that kind of infrastructure here
 
02:01:18.229 --> 02:01:18.239 align:start position:0%
in our state uh to answer the question
 
02:01:19.510 --> 02:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
that came up
 
02:01:21.830 --> 02:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
regarding funding under the bipartisan
 
02:01:23.990 --> 02:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure law uh again uh
 
02:01:25.510 --> 02:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
representative ebel had it right there's
 
02:01:27.830 --> 02:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh i think actually the the numbers that
 
02:01:29.669 --> 02:01:29.679 align:start position:0%
they depend they parse it out in a few
 
02:01:31.830 --> 02:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
different ways it's about 350 million
 
02:01:34.070 --> 02:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
dollars over five years that that bill
 
02:01:36.950 --> 02:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
appropriates for for solid waste issues
 
02:01:36.960 --> 02:01:37.830 align:start position:0%
appropriates for for solid waste issues
and

02:01:37.830 --> 02:01:37.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:01:40.229 --> 02:01:40.239 align:start position:0%
much of that is to be dedicated to
 
02:01:43.109 --> 02:01:43.119 align:start position:0%
grants for recycling not entirely clear
 
02:01:45.430 --> 02:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
right now how epa will they're still
 
02:01:47.270 --> 02:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
sorting it out themselves but not
 
02:01:49.750 --> 02:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
entirely clear how they will choose to
 
02:01:51.990 --> 02:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
administer that they may well make some
 
02:01:54.229 --> 02:01:54.239 align:start position:0%
of their own grants directly to
 
02:01:55.750 --> 02:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
applicants who come in looking for
 
02:01:57.910 --> 02:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
grants but certainly a portion of its
 
02:02:00.229 --> 02:02:00.239 align:start position:0%
substantial portion is expected to be
 
02:02:00.239 --> 02:02:01.669 align:start position:0%
substantial portion is expected to be
allocated

02:02:01.669 --> 02:02:01.679 align:start position:0%
allocated
 
02:02:04.870 --> 02:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
for grants to the states and once we
 
02:02:06.470 --> 02:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
have a better idea what that looks like
 
02:02:09.270 --> 02:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
certainly i think you know i hate to try
 
02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:10.310 align:start position:0%
certainly i think you know i hate to try
to

02:02:10.310 --> 02:02:10.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:02:11.910 --> 02:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
speculate what we might be able to
 
02:02:13.830 --> 02:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
obtain but if we look at that kind of
 
02:02:15.350 --> 02:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
level of funding and how it usually
 
02:02:17.270 --> 02:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
translates to new hampshire
 
02:02:19.430 --> 02:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
from the national level funding it's
 
02:02:21.350 --> 02:02:21.360 align:start position:0%
very possible that we could
 
02:02:24.070 --> 02:02:24.080 align:start position:0%
compete for or apply for a grant of
 
02:02:25.669 --> 02:02:25.679 align:start position:0%
several hundred thousand dollars a year
 
02:02:27.430 --> 02:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
over the next five years
 
02:02:29.510 --> 02:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
that might allow us to make some really
 
02:02:31.270 --> 02:02:31.280 align:start position:0%
and again that's against a backdrop
 
02:02:33.189 --> 02:02:33.199 align:start position:0%
where we have no money for that right
 
02:02:35.109 --> 02:02:35.119 align:start position:0%
now we make no incentive grants
 
02:02:37.750 --> 02:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
whatsoever to advance or encourage um
 
02:02:40.070 --> 02:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
recycling technologies so that's from
 
02:02:42.229 --> 02:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
zero to whatever it is and that that
 
02:02:43.750 --> 02:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
could be very substantial in a state
 
02:02:45.990 --> 02:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
like new hampshire to help you know
 
02:02:48.229 --> 02:02:48.239 align:start position:0%
advance some of these technologies and
 
02:02:49.510 --> 02:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
i'll leave it at that and be happy to
 
02:02:51.350 --> 02:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you any
 
02:02:53.270 --> 02:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
questions representative murray
 
02:02:54.870 --> 02:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair for taking my
 
02:02:56.870 --> 02:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
question thank you director wimsett just
 
02:02:58.709 --> 02:02:58.719 align:start position:0%
to be clear this is a dedicated
 
02:03:00.790 --> 02:03:00.800 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing fund is that correct that's
 
02:03:02.070 --> 02:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
correct that's my understanding thank
 
02:03:02.080 --> 02:03:03.109 align:start position:0%
correct that's my understanding thank
you

02:03:03.109 --> 02:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:03:05.270 --> 02:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
02:03:07.270 --> 02:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
representative comptoa
 
02:03:09.030 --> 02:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
02:03:11.350 --> 02:03:11.360 align:start position:0%
director for taking my question um in
 
02:03:13.589 --> 02:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
lou this says it's a non-lapsing fund
 
02:03:15.669 --> 02:03:15.679 align:start position:0%
what happens when those federal the
 
02:03:17.910 --> 02:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
grant funds run out
 
02:03:21.109 --> 02:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
so um assuming that you know if if if
 
02:03:22.950 --> 02:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
the fund is created and the only source
 
02:03:24.470 --> 02:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
of funding that it ever gets is from
 
02:03:27.109 --> 02:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
federal grants then likely what we would
 
02:03:29.270 --> 02:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
do and again it has to be said we don't
 
02:03:30.470 --> 02:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
know what these grants are going to look
 
02:03:33.109 --> 02:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
like it's possible that epa would make
 
02:03:34.709 --> 02:03:34.719 align:start position:0%
grants available that would do something
 
02:03:36.470 --> 02:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
that's outside the realm of what the
 
02:03:38.790 --> 02:03:38.800 align:start position:0%
fund has been intended for in which case
 
02:03:40.229 --> 02:03:40.239 align:start position:0%
we could potentially go after those
 
02:03:41.589 --> 02:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
grants and just
 
02:03:42.790 --> 02:03:42.800 align:start position:0%
not put them in the fund just to
 
02:03:44.470 --> 02:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
administer them through the normal grant
 
02:03:46.629 --> 02:03:46.639 align:start position:0%
administration process which we do in a
 
02:03:49.270 --> 02:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
number of programs at des but given that
 
02:03:51.030 --> 02:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
the bipartisan infrastructure law is
 
02:03:53.270 --> 02:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
intended to advance recycling and that's
 
02:03:55.589 --> 02:03:55.599 align:start position:0%
what this fund is really about um we
 
02:03:58.629 --> 02:03:58.639 align:start position:0%
would deposit those funds to to
 
02:04:00.950 --> 02:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
those grant monies to the fund and
 
02:04:03.589 --> 02:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
administer them um until until they ran
 
02:04:04.950 --> 02:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
out and if they ran out we wouldn't do
 
02:04:07.030 --> 02:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
it anymore but that's not inconsistent
 
02:04:08.709 --> 02:04:08.719 align:start position:0%
with what we've done in many programs
 
02:04:12.149 --> 02:04:12.159 align:start position:0%
there are lots of programs at des where
 
02:04:14.069 --> 02:04:14.079 align:start position:0%
federal funding comes for a period of
 
02:04:16.790 --> 02:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
time to accomplish a particular goal and
 
02:04:18.870 --> 02:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
we go after those funds to the extent
 
02:04:20.950 --> 02:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate with our mission and we
 
02:04:22.550 --> 02:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
administer them accordingly and then
 
02:04:25.109 --> 02:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
when they run out we we'd go back to
 
02:04:27.750 --> 02:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
doing what we were doing before
 
02:04:29.750 --> 02:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative aaron
 
02:04:31.109 --> 02:04:31.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
02:04:33.430 --> 02:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
director wimsat for coming and speaking
 
02:04:35.350 --> 02:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
to us about this
 
02:04:37.589 --> 02:04:37.599 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation i'm interested to
 
02:04:40.550 --> 02:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
know in so far as the rulemaking
 
02:04:40.560 --> 02:04:43.830 align:start position:0%
know in so far as the rulemaking
from

02:04:43.830 --> 02:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:47.430 --> 02:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:49.990 --> 02:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
do you have an idea in
 
02:04:53.030 --> 02:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
anticipation of how long though it takes
 
02:04:55.830 --> 02:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
to get those rules put into place once
 
02:04:57.830 --> 02:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
this fund is established
 
02:05:01.109 --> 02:05:01.119 align:start position:0%
and um would the rules mirror what the
 
02:05:03.589 --> 02:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
federal government guidelines
 
02:05:05.270 --> 02:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
would dictate for
 
02:05:07.350 --> 02:05:07.360 align:start position:0%
disbursement of these funds
 
02:05:09.910 --> 02:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
so typically rulemaking takes if you
 
02:05:11.510 --> 02:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
look at from
 
02:05:13.669 --> 02:05:13.679 align:start position:0%
first conception of what you want to do
 
02:05:16.709 --> 02:05:16.719 align:start position:0%
to actually have them implemented
 
02:05:17.990 --> 02:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:05:19.669 --> 02:05:19.679 align:start position:0%
we've done it faster when we're in a big
 
02:05:21.030 --> 02:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
rush and we know exactly what we want
 
02:05:22.709 --> 02:05:22.719 align:start position:0%
but usually if you can count on about a
 
02:05:25.109 --> 02:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
year to get those rules in place
 
02:05:28.069 --> 02:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
um if if we know
 
02:05:29.750 --> 02:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
what i would advocate i think for this
 
02:05:31.270 --> 02:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
is to keep those rules very simple
 
02:05:31.280 --> 02:05:32.470 align:start position:0%
is to keep those rules very simple
because

02:05:32.470 --> 02:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:05:34.069 --> 02:05:34.079 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns is that if you if
 
02:05:35.910 --> 02:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
you box yourself in with rules in a way
 
02:05:37.510 --> 02:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
that means that that most of the money
 
02:05:39.270 --> 02:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
that might come your way would not
 
02:05:41.430 --> 02:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
comport with those then you haven't done
 
02:05:43.189 --> 02:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
yourself any favors so we would look at
 
02:05:45.270 --> 02:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
that very carefully and try to make sure
 
02:05:47.270 --> 02:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
that the rulemaking we did
 
02:05:49.430 --> 02:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
really was just procedural this is how
 
02:05:51.830 --> 02:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
you uh how we advertise and how people
 
02:05:53.990 --> 02:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
apply for a grant and this is how we
 
02:05:56.069 --> 02:05:56.079 align:start position:0%
administer that grant and we we're not
 
02:05:57.750 --> 02:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
inventing anything out of whole cloth
 
02:06:00.069 --> 02:06:00.079 align:start position:0%
here des operates
 
02:06:01.589 --> 02:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
a number of programs where federal
 
02:06:04.149 --> 02:06:04.159 align:start position:0%
monies come to us and we we um
 
02:06:05.510 --> 02:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
we implement
 
02:06:08.390 --> 02:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
implement that um so it really depends
 
02:06:11.350 --> 02:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
we have to look at it but again um
 
02:06:12.950 --> 02:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
you don't want to do it in a way that
 
02:06:15.830 --> 02:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
that makes your your rules basically
 
02:06:17.030 --> 02:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
handcuff you to the point where you
 
02:06:19.669 --> 02:06:19.679 align:start position:0%
can't accept or spend money
 
02:06:20.629 --> 02:06:20.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:06:22.310 --> 02:06:22.320 align:start position:0%
representative bixby
 
02:06:24.069 --> 02:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
yes thank you chair thank you director
 
02:06:26.470 --> 02:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh
 
02:06:26.480 --> 02:06:27.669 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh
so

02:06:27.669 --> 02:06:27.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:06:29.589 --> 02:06:29.599 align:start position:0%
um is this
 
02:06:32.629 --> 02:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
build uh aimed only at the
 
02:06:34.870 --> 02:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
infrastructure funds or would you be on
 
02:06:36.470 --> 02:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
the lookout for other granting
 
02:06:38.629 --> 02:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
possibilities that could also fulfill
 
02:06:40.470 --> 02:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
the purpose we would always be
 
02:06:42.470 --> 02:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
interested in any funds that could come
 
02:06:44.870 --> 02:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
our way to advance these these goals so
 
02:06:46.870 --> 02:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
i i would not limit it to federal funds
 
02:06:48.550 --> 02:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
through the bipartisan infrastructure
 
02:06:51.109 --> 02:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
law at all thank you
 
02:06:53.510 --> 02:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
anybody else representative amola
 
02:06:55.750 --> 02:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
yes sir thank you for taking my question
 
02:06:57.189 --> 02:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
and if you've covered this i'm sorry i'm
 
02:06:59.510 --> 02:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
just i just missed this but for the
 
02:07:01.669 --> 02:07:01.679 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing revolving fund obviously
 
02:07:03.669 --> 02:07:03.679 align:start position:0%
we're talking about that it's for
 
02:07:06.229 --> 02:07:06.239 align:start position:0%
federal federal dollars and when the
 
02:07:08.310 --> 02:07:08.320 align:start position:0%
federal dollars ran out runs out the
 
02:07:10.870 --> 02:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
non-lapse revolving fund stops is that
 
02:07:12.229 --> 02:07:12.239 align:start position:0%
we're saying or does that get
 
02:07:13.750 --> 02:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
supplemented with state funding at that
 
02:07:13.760 --> 02:07:14.709 align:start position:0%
supplemented with state funding at that
point

02:07:14.709 --> 02:07:14.719 align:start position:0%
point
 
02:07:16.790 --> 02:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
no i think as i understand it the fund
 
02:07:16.800 --> 02:07:17.510 align:start position:0%
no i think as i understand it the fund
would

02:07:17.510 --> 02:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:07:19.350 --> 02:07:19.360 align:start position:0%
let's say for argument's sake that we
 
02:07:20.950 --> 02:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
got five years of funding and we set
 
02:07:23.910 --> 02:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
this program up and we put
 
02:07:25.830 --> 02:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
that grant funding into this solid waste
 
02:07:27.589 --> 02:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
management fund and administer it for
 
02:07:30.390 --> 02:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
five years and then epa stops making any
 
02:07:31.669 --> 02:07:31.679 align:start position:0%
further grants and we don't have any
 
02:07:33.990 --> 02:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
other sources of money we would simply
 
02:07:35.910 --> 02:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh you know administer the grant give
 
02:07:37.830 --> 02:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
out all the grant money presumably and
 
02:07:39.589 --> 02:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
then the the fund could still sit there
 
02:07:41.270 --> 02:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
with a zero balance but it would still
 
02:07:43.030 --> 02:07:43.040 align:start position:0%
exist and so that if something came
 
02:07:43.040 --> 02:07:44.550 align:start position:0%
exist and so that if something came
along

02:07:44.550 --> 02:07:44.560 align:start position:0%
along
 
02:07:46.550 --> 02:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
two years after that we could go after
 
02:07:48.390 --> 02:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
it and put it back into the fund that's
 
02:07:50.870 --> 02:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
that's why i would understand it okay
 
02:07:52.870 --> 02:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify it does not obligate
 
02:07:57.109 --> 02:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
us then at the state level to replenish
 
02:07:58.870 --> 02:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
a certain amount that
 
02:08:01.510 --> 02:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
um that had been granted
 
02:08:03.030 --> 02:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
no i'm not i'm not aware that it
 
02:08:05.109 --> 02:08:05.119 align:start position:0%
obligates us to anything of the sort the
 
02:08:08.790 --> 02:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
the um uh
 
02:08:10.629 --> 02:08:10.639 align:start position:0%
the only thing i will say is that if we
 
02:08:12.629 --> 02:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
you know when we get a grant from epa it
 
02:08:14.310 --> 02:08:14.320 align:start position:0%
has its own conditions they're the grant
 
02:08:16.870 --> 02:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
giver they get to make the rules and so
 
02:08:18.709 --> 02:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
we would there could be a situation
 
02:08:20.390 --> 02:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
where and and we're pretty good at
 
02:08:22.069 --> 02:08:22.079 align:start position:0%
spending money so i wouldn't think we'd
 
02:08:23.430 --> 02:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
run into this but it could be a
 
02:08:25.030 --> 02:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
situation where we get a grant and we
 
02:08:26.709 --> 02:08:26.719 align:start position:0%
don't get the money out the door quick
 
02:08:28.310 --> 02:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
enough and after a period of time epa
 
02:08:30.629 --> 02:08:30.639 align:start position:0%
says we want the balance back in which
 
02:08:31.910 --> 02:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
case we'd have to give it back to them
 
02:08:33.750 --> 02:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
but you know that's something we strive
 
02:08:35.750 --> 02:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
not to do once the epa gives us a grant
 
02:08:37.510 --> 02:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
we try to use it
 
02:08:37.520 --> 02:08:38.550 align:start position:0%
we try to use it
promptly

02:08:38.550 --> 02:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
promptly
 
02:08:41.189 --> 02:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
for the intended purpose thank you
 
02:08:43.430 --> 02:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
02:08:46.229 --> 02:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
seeing none we thank your director
 
02:08:48.830 --> 02:08:48.840 align:start position:0%

02:09:47.040 --> 02:09:48.310 align:start position:0%
swag
and

02:09:48.310 --> 02:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:09:49.910 --> 02:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
the house has a participant on that
 
02:09:52.470 --> 02:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
committee it's representative ebel and
 
02:09:54.310 --> 02:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
the senate also has a participant on
 
02:09:56.069 --> 02:09:56.079 align:start position:0%
that committee and that's senator gray
 
02:09:58.149 --> 02:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
and they are both in favor of this
 
02:10:00.390 --> 02:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
and the two charges to that ongoing
 
02:10:02.950 --> 02:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
committee or commission would be to
 
02:10:04.470 --> 02:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
review and make recommendations
 
02:10:06.790 --> 02:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
regarding municipal solid waste plans
 
02:10:08.629 --> 02:10:08.639 align:start position:0%
and implementing the prohibition of any
 
02:10:10.310 --> 02:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
landfill in the state from accepting
 
02:10:12.629 --> 02:10:12.639 align:start position:0%
wastes for municipality that does not
 
02:10:14.950 --> 02:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
have a solid waste management plan
 
02:10:16.709 --> 02:10:16.719 align:start position:0%
now that's a
 
02:10:18.229 --> 02:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
they would add that to the charge they
 
02:10:20.069 --> 02:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
don't have to recommend that they just
 
02:10:21.430 --> 02:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
have to look at that and what the
 
02:10:23.109 --> 02:10:23.119 align:start position:0%
benefits um
 
02:10:25.510 --> 02:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
or costs or um
 
02:10:27.270 --> 02:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
negative effects of doing something that
 
02:10:28.470 --> 02:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
like that would be
 
02:10:30.470 --> 02:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
also to review and make recommendations
 
02:10:32.390 --> 02:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
regarding the development of a solid
 
02:10:35.669 --> 02:10:35.679 align:start position:0%
waste disposal site evaluation committee
 
02:10:37.830 --> 02:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
or better defining alternative site
 
02:10:40.310 --> 02:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
analysis in our current rsas and that's
 
02:10:42.310 --> 02:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
what this bill does i'm happy to take
 
02:10:42.320 --> 02:10:44.709 align:start position:0%

yes um thank you for taking my question
 
02:10:51.990 --> 02:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:52.790 align:start position:0%
uh the
um

02:10:52.790 --> 02:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:55.030 --> 02:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
charge number one uh
 
02:10:56.709 --> 02:10:56.719 align:start position:0%
we uh
 
02:10:59.189 --> 02:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
looking at uh requiring municipal solid
 
02:11:01.750 --> 02:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
waste plans uh for
 
02:11:05.510 --> 02:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
being able to uh dump into a landfill
 
02:11:05.520 --> 02:11:06.310 align:start position:0%
being able to uh dump into a landfill
is

02:11:06.310 --> 02:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:11:07.750 --> 02:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
02:11:10.669 --> 02:11:10.679 align:start position:0%
would that just cover
 
02:11:12.629 --> 02:11:12.639 align:start position:0%
municipalities within the state of new
 
02:11:15.030 --> 02:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire or would any
 
02:11:16.629 --> 02:11:16.639 align:start position:0%
entity anywhere
 
02:11:19.669 --> 02:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
in the world need to have a solid
 
02:11:22.550 --> 02:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
a solid waste plan in order to
 
02:11:24.310 --> 02:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
be able to dump into a new hampshire
 
02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:25.990 align:start position:0%
be able to dump into a new hampshire
landfill

02:11:25.990 --> 02:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
landfill
 
02:11:28.390 --> 02:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
so as the sponsor of this ideally it
 
02:11:29.910 --> 02:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
would be everyone who would want to dump
 
02:11:31.270 --> 02:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
something in new hampshire but that
 
02:11:34.149 --> 02:11:34.159 align:start position:0%
would be up to the swag to determine how
 
02:11:35.750 --> 02:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to review that and what
 
02:11:37.430 --> 02:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
their recommendation again it would just
 
02:11:39.669 --> 02:11:39.679 align:start position:0%
be a recommendation that they would make
 
02:11:42.870 --> 02:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
to the legislature okay
 
02:11:44.310 --> 02:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
but you are
 
02:11:46.470 --> 02:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
you were hoping that this may be a way
 
02:11:49.189 --> 02:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
of reducing the pressure of out of state
 
02:11:54.069 --> 02:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:56.709 --> 02:11:56.719 align:start position:0%
i am hoping that um this is a way that
 
02:11:59.270 --> 02:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
we can look at alternatives to disposal
 
02:12:01.350 --> 02:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire and not
 
02:12:02.709 --> 02:12:02.719 align:start position:0%
putting as much
 
02:12:05.830 --> 02:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
waste in the landfills okay thank you
 
02:12:08.950 --> 02:12:08.960 align:start position:0%

the work that the swag is going to be
 
02:13:00.310 --> 02:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
doing in anticipation of the long range
 
02:13:03.030 --> 02:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
solid waste plan our
 
02:13:06.550 --> 02:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
working group does have a five-year term
 
02:13:09.510 --> 02:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
and we're going to be looking at
 
02:13:11.350 --> 02:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
many many different things and we're
 
02:13:13.109 --> 02:13:13.119 align:start position:0%
going to be continuing to work with the
 
02:13:15.510 --> 02:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
department because as the department
 
02:13:18.069 --> 02:13:18.079 align:start position:0%
will tell you and as we believe we think
 
02:13:20.870 --> 02:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
the long-range plan will be a sort of a
 
02:13:24.069 --> 02:13:24.079 align:start position:0%
living working document and so
 
02:13:27.189 --> 02:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
as the swag makes recommendations as
 
02:13:27.199 --> 02:13:28.950 align:start position:0%
as the swag makes recommendations as
their

02:13:28.950 --> 02:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:13:31.430 --> 02:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
as it's deemed appropriate to put into
 
02:13:33.750 --> 02:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
the long-range plan as we come forward
 
02:13:35.589 --> 02:13:35.599 align:start position:0%
to the legislature with ideas for
 
02:13:38.550 --> 02:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
legislation um we're going to be looking
 
02:13:42.310 --> 02:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
at any variety of subjects and these are
 
02:13:46.229 --> 02:13:46.239 align:start position:0%

that up a little bit as we
 
02:14:29.750 --> 02:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
work as as we come closer to the
 
02:14:33.350 --> 02:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
production of the long-range plan
 
02:14:36.229 --> 02:14:36.239 align:start position:0%

that a lot of stakeholders in solid
 
02:15:11.750 --> 02:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
waste are asking about and talking about
 
02:15:14.069 --> 02:15:14.079 align:start position:0%
right now and from our perspective the
 
02:15:16.069 --> 02:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
solid waste working group is the
 
02:15:18.870 --> 02:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate forum to to explore and

02:16:09.750 --> 02:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
good morning and welcome to ena good
 
02:16:11.109 --> 02:16:11.119 align:start position:0%
morning it's a pleasure to be here i've
 
02:16:12.709 --> 02:16:12.719 align:start position:0%
been peppering you with emails for the
 
02:16:13.990 --> 02:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
greater part of i think a year and a
 
02:16:15.350 --> 02:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
half and this is my first time actually
 
02:16:16.709 --> 02:16:16.719 align:start position:0%
in person in your committee so very
 
02:16:18.629 --> 02:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
happy to be here
 
02:16:19.990 --> 02:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to provide
 
02:16:21.990 --> 02:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
testimony in support of
 
02:16:24.470 --> 02:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
sb 380 for the record my name is peter
 
02:16:26.390 --> 02:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
blair i am the northern new england zero
 
02:16:28.069 --> 02:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
waste staff attorney for conservation
 
02:16:31.030 --> 02:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
law foundation clf strongly supports
 
02:16:33.669 --> 02:16:33.679 align:start position:0%
sb380 we feel that the two changes to
 
02:16:35.429 --> 02:16:35.439 align:start position:0%
the duties and responsibilities of the
 
02:16:37.349 --> 02:16:37.359 align:start position:0%
solid waste working group are critically
 
02:16:39.190 --> 02:16:39.200 align:start position:0%
important for better understanding and
 
02:16:40.870 --> 02:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
evaluating the current waste management
 
02:16:42.629 --> 02:16:42.639 align:start position:0%
systems in new hampshire
 
02:16:44.230 --> 02:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
the first change would be that
 
02:16:46.549 --> 02:16:46.559 align:start position:0%
evaluation of whether to prohibit
 
02:16:48.230 --> 02:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
landfilling of waste from municipalities
 
02:16:49.750 --> 02:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
that do not have a solid waste
 
02:16:51.509 --> 02:16:51.519 align:start position:0%
management plan i would just like to
 
02:16:53.429 --> 02:16:53.439 align:start position:0%
point out that currently new hampshire
 
02:16:55.190 --> 02:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities are already required to
 
02:16:56.629 --> 02:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
develop these plans
 
02:16:58.309 --> 02:16:58.319 align:start position:0%
so it is not looking at increasing a
 
02:17:00.389 --> 02:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
burden on new hampshire municipalities
 
02:17:02.230 --> 02:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
just further understanding how they
 
02:17:03.750 --> 02:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
manage their waste
 
02:17:05.110 --> 02:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
what type of waste they're dealing with
 
02:17:06.389 --> 02:17:06.399 align:start position:0%
and is that waste being
 
02:17:08.790 --> 02:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
reduced and recycled prior to disposal
 
02:17:11.190 --> 02:17:11.200 align:start position:0%
but importantly the current law does not
 
02:17:12.830 --> 02:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
apply to out-of-state
 
02:17:14.389 --> 02:17:14.399 align:start position:0%
municipalities as you've heard
 
02:17:16.230 --> 02:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
throughout this session 50 percent of
 
02:17:17.750 --> 02:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
the waste landfill in new hampshire
 
02:17:19.349 --> 02:17:19.359 align:start position:0%
comes from out of state
 
02:17:21.349 --> 02:17:21.359 align:start position:0%
by focusing on whether there should be a
 
02:17:23.190 --> 02:17:23.200 align:start position:0%
prohibition on all municipalities that
 
02:17:25.349 --> 02:17:25.359 align:start position:0%
do not have these plans you'd be taking
 
02:17:27.349 --> 02:17:27.359 align:start position:0%
a holistic look on the amount of waste
 
02:17:28.629 --> 02:17:28.639 align:start position:0%
that is coming into new hampshire and
 
02:17:29.830 --> 02:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
whether that is being managed in
 
02:17:31.990 --> 02:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
accordance with the state's requirements
 
02:17:34.469 --> 02:17:34.479 align:start position:0%
and goals specifically the 50 reduction
 
02:17:37.509 --> 02:17:37.519 align:start position:0%
goal that was passed last year
 
02:17:41.509 --> 02:17:41.519 align:start position:0%
as for the second change in sb 380 clf
 
02:17:43.509 --> 02:17:43.519 align:start position:0%
generally speaking is not supportive of
 
02:17:45.750 --> 02:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
increasing disposal capacity in new
 
02:17:48.150 --> 02:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire however if there is a need for
 
02:17:49.750 --> 02:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
new disposal whether it be expanded
 
02:17:51.910 --> 02:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
landfills or new landfills we do think
 
02:17:53.429 --> 02:17:53.439 align:start position:0%
it is a good idea to
 
02:17:55.110 --> 02:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
take an evaluation of how the state
 
02:17:57.030 --> 02:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
currently looks at what is the proper
 
02:17:59.110 --> 02:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
site for those landfills you've all
 
02:18:00.309 --> 02:18:00.319 align:start position:0%
heard about the controversies
 
02:18:01.990 --> 02:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
surrounding the currently proposed
 
02:18:04.549 --> 02:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
granite state landfill in dalton
 
02:18:06.469 --> 02:18:06.479 align:start position:0%
the development of a solid waste
 
02:18:08.549 --> 02:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
disposal site evaluation committee or
 
02:18:10.870 --> 02:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
looking at the current regulations which
 
02:18:13.030 --> 02:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
relate to the alternative site analysis
 
02:18:15.509 --> 02:18:15.519 align:start position:0%
will better understand
 
02:18:17.669 --> 02:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
the range of opportunities there are to
 
02:18:19.190 --> 02:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
figure out where is the appropriate
 
02:18:21.190 --> 02:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
place we should be putting new disposal
 
02:18:23.750 --> 02:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
capacity if it is necessary
 
02:18:25.589 --> 02:18:25.599 align:start position:0%
so in conclusion we think that this bill
 
02:18:27.669 --> 02:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
is smart it squarely fits within the
 
02:18:29.270 --> 02:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
current duties and responsibilities of
 
02:18:32.070 --> 02:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
the swag which is a wonderful name for a
 
02:18:33.990 --> 02:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
very interesting committee
 
02:18:35.990 --> 02:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your up the opportunity
 
02:18:37.990 --> 02:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
to speak and i'll answer any questions
 
02:18:39.910 --> 02:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
you have
 
02:18:41.890 --> 02:18:41.900 align:start position:0%
well i'm proud to be a member of swag
 
02:18:41.900 --> 02:18:44.150 align:start position:0%
well i'm proud to be a member of swag
[Laughter]

02:18:44.150 --> 02:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
02:18:46.629 --> 02:18:46.639 align:start position:0%
all right uh representative comfort
 
02:18:47.910 --> 02:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:18:49.830 --> 02:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:18:49.840 --> 02:18:51.349 align:start position:0%
taking my question
so

02:18:51.349 --> 02:18:51.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:18:52.709 --> 02:18:52.719 align:start position:0%
when you were speaking you were saying
 
02:18:55.030 --> 02:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
that you know based on how we're reading
 
02:18:57.190 --> 02:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
this bill it would require any
 
02:18:59.750 --> 02:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
municipality anywhere that brings in
 
02:19:01.589 --> 02:19:01.599 align:start position:0%
solid waste to new hampshire to have a
 
02:19:03.910 --> 02:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
solid waste management plan
 
02:19:05.110 --> 02:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
how would we
 
02:19:06.549 --> 02:19:06.559 align:start position:0%
now there are private companies that
 
02:19:07.910 --> 02:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
also bring in
 
02:19:09.750 --> 02:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
waste to new hampshire how would this
 
02:19:11.669 --> 02:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
affect them
 
02:19:13.990 --> 02:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
so it wouldn't impact private companies
 
02:19:15.589 --> 02:19:15.599 align:start position:0%
but a significant amount of waste does
 
02:19:17.830 --> 02:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
come from municipalities and looking at
 
02:19:17.840 --> 02:19:18.790 align:start position:0%
come from municipalities and looking at
whether

02:19:18.790 --> 02:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
whether
 
02:19:20.389 --> 02:19:20.399 align:start position:0%
that way should be managed in accordance
 
02:19:21.830 --> 02:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
with new hampshire's
 
02:19:23.669 --> 02:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
reduction goals is really important
 
02:19:26.070 --> 02:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
currently new hampshire has no say over
 
02:19:27.349 --> 02:19:27.359 align:start position:0%
how the waste is being managed from the
 
02:19:29.190 --> 02:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities outside of new hampshire
 
02:19:31.990 --> 02:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
that are coming to private landfills
 
02:19:33.030 --> 02:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
or even
 
02:19:35.349 --> 02:19:35.359 align:start position:0%
the publicly owned ones so by looking
 
02:19:36.469 --> 02:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
into this prohibition you'd be
 
02:19:38.150 --> 02:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
essentially looking at what vermont has
 
02:19:40.230 --> 02:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
done which vermont only has one landfill
 
02:19:41.910 --> 02:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
they're very protective of it and
 
02:19:43.190 --> 02:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
they've decided that they want to make
 
02:19:45.030 --> 02:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
sure that every municipality that sends
 
02:19:47.349 --> 02:19:47.359 align:start position:0%
waste to that single landfill has to
 
02:19:49.670 --> 02:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
have this type of plan has to show that
 
02:19:51.990 --> 02:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
they are managing their waste in a way
 
02:19:53.750 --> 02:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
that is reducing it complying with their
 
02:19:55.830 --> 02:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
hierarchy meeting their waste reduction
 
02:19:57.750 --> 02:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
goals so it wouldn't deal with things
 
02:19:59.830 --> 02:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
like construction and demolition debris
 
02:20:01.510 --> 02:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
but it would deal with a significant
 
02:20:02.630 --> 02:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
amount of the waste coming into the
 
02:20:03.510 --> 02:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
state which is coming from
 
02:20:05.030 --> 02:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities primarily in
 
02:20:05.040 --> 02:20:07.670 align:start position:0%
municipalities primarily in
massachusetts

02:20:07.670 --> 02:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
02:20:09.670 --> 02:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
representative bixby
 
02:20:11.270 --> 02:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
02:20:13.030 --> 02:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
question i just want to follow up on
 
02:20:14.630 --> 02:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
that a little bit which is
 
02:20:17.670 --> 02:20:17.680 align:start position:0%
i i want to make sure that it's clear
 
02:20:20.630 --> 02:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
that this bill does not actually put
 
02:20:24.150 --> 02:20:24.160 align:start position:0%
that requirement of the solid waste plan
 
02:20:24.160 --> 02:20:25.110 align:start position:0%
that requirement of the solid waste plan
on

02:20:25.110 --> 02:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:20:25.120 --> 02:20:26.389 align:start position:0%
on
um

02:20:26.389 --> 02:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:28.710 --> 02:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities beyond new hampshire that
 
02:20:30.870 --> 02:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
this is just having the swag look at
 
02:20:33.830 --> 02:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
that possibility and examine how
 
02:20:36.070 --> 02:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
to do it or whether to do it yes that is
 
02:20:38.150 --> 02:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
exactly correct um it will just be
 
02:20:39.429 --> 02:20:39.439 align:start position:0%
evaluating whether this type of
 
02:20:41.110 --> 02:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
prohibition is a smart move for new
 
02:20:42.950 --> 02:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire it's up to the swag to make a
 
02:20:45.030 --> 02:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the legislature after
 
02:20:47.190 --> 02:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
they evaluate it but i think it's an
 
02:20:49.270 --> 02:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
important thing to look at given the
 
02:20:50.389 --> 02:20:50.399 align:start position:0%
amount of out-of-state waste that's
 
02:20:52.870 --> 02:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
coming into new hampshire and
 
02:20:54.710 --> 02:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
importantly the fact that there is now
 
02:20:56.150 --> 02:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
going to be a forthcoming solid waste
 
02:20:58.389 --> 02:20:58.399 align:start position:0%
management plan the current municipal
 
02:21:00.150 --> 02:21:00.160 align:start position:0%
plans that new hampshire has their
 
02:21:02.630 --> 02:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities create are supposed to
 
02:21:04.389 --> 02:21:04.399 align:start position:0%
meet the goals and objectives of that
 
02:21:06.870 --> 02:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
plan so it's really the perfect time to
 
02:21:08.469 --> 02:21:08.479 align:start position:0%
begin evaluating this and they can make
 
02:21:09.670 --> 02:21:09.680 align:start position:0%
the recommendation whether it's the
 
02:21:11.190 --> 02:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
right move for new hampshire and that'll
 
02:21:12.790 --> 02:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
be up for the legislature to decide at a
 
02:21:15.590 --> 02:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
later date thank you
 
02:21:18.150 --> 02:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
02:21:20.389 --> 02:21:20.399 align:start position:0%
seeing none we thank you thank you
 
02:21:21.590 --> 02:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
anybody else that would like to speak on
 
02:21:23.910 --> 02:21:23.920 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:21:26.630 --> 02:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
all right see none uh the blue sheet we
 
02:21:29.190 --> 02:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
have excuse me we have four sign ins in
 
02:21:31.670 --> 02:21:31.680 align:start position:0%

02:21:46.630 --> 02:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:46.640 --> 02:21:48.710 align:start position:0%

anybody see any reason not to protect
 
02:21:59.349 --> 02:21:59.359 align:start position:0%
this now
 
02:22:00.950 --> 02:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
that's righty
 
02:22:01.990 --> 02:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:22:03.349 --> 02:22:03.359 align:start position:0%

02:22:13.990 --> 02:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know i just decided it was oh
 
02:22:17.510 --> 02:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:20.070 --> 02:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
uh mr chair i would like to
 
02:22:25.670 --> 02:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
move for otp on senate bill 380-fn
 
02:22:28.790 --> 02:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
all right do we have a second
 
02:22:33.110 --> 02:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:35.910 --> 02:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
so we have a motion to about to pass on
 
02:22:38.070 --> 02:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
senate bill 380 and second i'll open it
 
02:22:40.389 --> 02:22:40.399 align:start position:0%
up to the committee for discussion
 
02:22:41.750 --> 02:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative dutsy would you like to
 
02:22:43.670 --> 02:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion
 
02:22:43.680 --> 02:22:44.790 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion
um

02:22:44.790 --> 02:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:47.110 --> 02:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
yes i mean i i think this is a good idea
 
02:22:48.870 --> 02:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
to give um
 
02:22:52.070 --> 02:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
the swag jurisdiction over this so that
 
02:22:55.190 --> 02:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
they can um explore it further and see
 
02:22:58.950 --> 02:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
if any um regulations or legislation
 
02:23:00.870 --> 02:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
needs to be considered
 
02:23:03.030 --> 02:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i i want to say
 
02:23:06.070 --> 02:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
and this is in relationship to nashua
 
02:23:08.630 --> 02:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
nashua has its own landfill
 
02:23:10.630 --> 02:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
and yet what we're finding
 
02:23:10.640 --> 02:23:11.910 align:start position:0%
and yet what we're finding
recently

02:23:11.910 --> 02:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
recently
 
02:23:14.790 --> 02:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
is that we have um
 
02:23:20.389 --> 02:23:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:21.750 --> 02:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
the reset
 
02:23:21.760 --> 02:23:23.670 align:start position:0%
the reset
the

02:23:23.670 --> 02:23:23.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:23:27.750 --> 02:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
trashing i i'll say of commission of
 
02:23:30.790 --> 02:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
construction and demolition debris
 
02:23:33.270 --> 02:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
and what they're doing is they're using
 
02:23:35.190 --> 02:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
false addresses
 
02:23:36.950 --> 02:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
so they're saying that they're coming
 
02:23:36.960 --> 02:23:37.990 align:start position:0%
so they're saying that they're coming
here

02:23:37.990 --> 02:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:23:40.990 --> 02:23:41.000 align:start position:0%
for a certain address that they've been
 
02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.110 align:start position:0%
for a certain address that they've been
[Music]

02:23:43.110 --> 02:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:23:44.950 --> 02:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
renovating their kitchen or their
 
02:23:47.830 --> 02:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
bathroom and when
 
02:23:50.070 --> 02:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
dpw goes ahead and checks it out and
 
02:23:52.550 --> 02:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
calls that home that home has had no
 
02:23:52.560 --> 02:23:53.830 align:start position:0%
calls that home that home has had no
renovations

02:23:53.830 --> 02:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
renovations
 
02:23:57.030 --> 02:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
so i think it's really critical that we
 
02:23:59.349 --> 02:23:59.359 align:start position:0%
that we have the swag committee begin to
 
02:24:01.429 --> 02:24:01.439 align:start position:0%
look at things like this because i think
 
02:24:02.950 --> 02:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
with the pressures going on with
 
02:24:05.429 --> 02:24:05.439 align:start position:0%
landfills you're going to find this
 
02:24:05.439 --> 02:24:07.270 align:start position:0%
landfills you're going to find this
behavior

02:24:07.270 --> 02:24:07.280 align:start position:0%
behavior
 
02:24:09.750 --> 02:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
more and more within new hampshire so i
 
02:24:13.510 --> 02:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:18.550 --> 02:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:20.630 --> 02:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
seeing none i'm going to
 
02:24:22.630 --> 02:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
ask the clerk to call the rule on senate
 
02:24:24.950 --> 02:24:24.960 align:start position:0%

after the senate hearing it it became
 
04:03:21.990 --> 04:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
very clear to me that my original
 
04:03:22.000 --> 04:03:23.269 align:start position:0%
very clear to me that my original
concept

04:03:23.269 --> 04:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
concept
 
04:03:24.550 --> 04:03:24.560 align:start position:0%

some issues with it

that should be addressed and so
 
04:03:29.910 --> 04:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
taking some time to
 
04:03:32.389 --> 04:03:32.399 align:start position:0%
to look at what it really was that we
 
04:03:33.750 --> 04:03:33.760 align:start position:0%

04:03:35.510 --> 04:03:35.520 align:start position:0%

04:03:53.830 --> 04:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
misrepresentation of
 
04:03:55.670 --> 04:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
of the situation so
 
04:03:58.070 --> 04:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
i do did give your clerk some written uh
 
04:04:01.030 --> 04:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
written testimony and i'll try to stick
 
04:04:04.389 --> 04:04:04.399 align:start position:0%
to that at this point
 
04:04:06.710 --> 04:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
and i sent you all information that
 
04:04:09.110 --> 04:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
covered some but not all of the points
 
04:04:11.110 --> 04:04:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh in the email you received i didn't
 
04:04:12.790 --> 04:04:12.800 align:start position:0%
have enough time to address everything
 
04:04:15.349 --> 04:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
last night nor could i even absorb all
 
04:04:17.269 --> 04:04:17.279 align:start position:0%
of the misstatements included at that
 
04:04:17.279 --> 04:04:18.550 align:start position:0%
of the misstatements included at that
time

04:04:18.550 --> 04:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:04:20.150 --> 04:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
let me tell you about the reality of
 
04:04:22.389 --> 04:04:22.399 align:start position:0%
what we face with unlicensed pet vendors
 
04:04:24.950 --> 04:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
and while there may not be many of them
 
04:04:26.870 --> 04:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
they take up an inordinate amount of
 
04:04:28.309 --> 04:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
staff time
 
04:04:30.389 --> 04:04:30.399 align:start position:0%
we have one business which which has
 
04:04:32.630 --> 04:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
never been licensed and can't be due to
 
04:04:35.269 --> 04:04:35.279 align:start position:0%
town zoning issues
 
04:04:36.309 --> 04:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
we have a
 
04:04:38.630 --> 04:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
drawer and a filing cabinet
 
04:04:41.429 --> 04:04:41.439 align:start position:0%
dedicated to these people the files go
 
04:04:43.910 --> 04:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
back more than 15 years
 
04:04:46.070 --> 04:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
there have been several court cases but
 
04:04:48.389 --> 04:04:48.399 align:start position:0%
even when the town wins the activities
 
04:04:48.399 --> 04:04:49.910 align:start position:0%
even when the town wins the activities
persist

04:04:49.910 --> 04:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
persist
 
04:04:51.910 --> 04:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
currently arrests have been made and
 
04:04:53.590 --> 04:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
court dates have been set but the
 
04:04:56.790 --> 04:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
transfer of dogs continues
 
04:04:58.950 --> 04:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
if a person is willing to continue his
 
04:05:01.429 --> 04:05:01.439 align:start position:0%
act as an unlicensed pet vendor and are
 
04:05:03.189 --> 04:05:03.199 align:start position:0%
selling dogs for around
 
04:05:05.510 --> 04:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
four thousand dollars each do you see a
 
04:05:09.349 --> 04:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar fine as a disincentive
 
04:05:12.070 --> 04:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
the reality is that only recently have
 
04:05:13.910 --> 04:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
we been able to obtain the health
 
04:05:15.750 --> 04:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
certificates that prove the violations
 
04:05:16.870 --> 04:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
of law
 
04:05:19.189 --> 04:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
this past year alone
 
04:05:21.750 --> 04:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
around 200 dogs were transferred
 
04:05:25.349 --> 04:05:25.359 align:start position:0%
illegally from this one
 
04:05:25.359 --> 04:05:26.469 align:start position:0%
illegally from this one
vendor

04:05:26.469 --> 04:05:26.479 align:start position:0%
vendor
 
04:05:28.710 --> 04:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
every hour that is spent on this case is
 
04:05:31.750 --> 04:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
an hour not spent doing the job you have
 
04:05:33.349 --> 04:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
asked us to do
 
04:05:35.110 --> 04:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
this past year between working with the
 
04:05:36.950 --> 04:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
local pd and tracking down health
 
04:05:36.960 --> 04:05:38.070 align:start position:0%
local pd and tracking down health
certificates

04:05:38.070 --> 04:05:38.080 align:start position:0%
certificates
 
04:05:40.469 --> 04:05:40.479 align:start position:0%
we spent well over a hundred man hours
 
04:05:43.349 --> 04:05:43.359 align:start position:0%
on this one case alone think about that
 
04:05:46.870 --> 04:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
almost three weeks of one person's time
 
04:05:49.349 --> 04:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
with no results even though one
 
04:05:52.309 --> 04:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
individual has been arrested twice
 
04:05:55.349 --> 04:05:55.359 align:start position:0%
the sale of dogs has not stopped
 
04:05:57.510 --> 04:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
most of our issues are actually relative
 
04:06:00.229 --> 04:06:00.239 align:start position:0%
to a few licensed facilities not meeting
 
04:06:02.710 --> 04:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
the standards set out in our rules basic
 
04:06:05.030 --> 04:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
conditions that the vast majority of our
 
04:06:07.349 --> 04:06:07.359 align:start position:0%
licensees can and do meet
 
04:06:08.710 --> 04:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
our goal is to bring them into
 
04:06:11.750 --> 04:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
compliance not to revoke a license or
 
04:06:12.950 --> 04:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
find them
 
04:06:14.550 --> 04:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
in the four and a half years i've been
 
04:06:16.070 --> 04:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner i believe that we have
 
04:06:19.189 --> 04:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
revoked one license with one revocation
 
04:06:21.189 --> 04:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
being adjudicated now
 
04:06:23.830 --> 04:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
while the b the bill does increase fees
 
04:06:26.710 --> 04:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
for repeated violations more importantly
 
04:06:28.309 --> 04:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
it would allow us to deal with them in a
 
04:06:29.750 --> 04:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
timely manner
 
04:06:31.750 --> 04:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
ultimately it would free up time to do
 
04:06:33.510 --> 04:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
the inspections which the legislature
 
04:06:34.870 --> 04:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
has tasked us
 
04:06:34.880 --> 04:06:35.910 align:start position:0%
has tasked us
with

04:06:35.910 --> 04:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:06:37.590 --> 04:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
the revocation that we are currently
 
04:06:39.670 --> 04:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
dealing with has its roots in continuing
 
04:06:42.469 --> 04:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
violations which began years ago
 
04:06:44.790 --> 04:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
finally after years of non-compliance we
 
04:06:47.269 --> 04:06:47.279 align:start position:0%
worked out a settlement agreement that
 
04:06:49.590 --> 04:06:49.600 align:start position:0%
spelled out some very specific actions
 
04:06:51.349 --> 04:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
which needed to be taken
 
04:06:53.189 --> 04:06:53.199 align:start position:0%
the settlement agreement was not adhered
 
04:06:55.590 --> 04:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
to and the license was revoked
 
04:06:59.349 --> 04:06:59.359 align:start position:0%
but revocation does not prevent a person
 
04:07:01.590 --> 04:07:01.600 align:start position:0%
to continue to operate until the case is
 
04:07:01.600 --> 04:07:03.349 align:start position:0%
to continue to operate until the case is
adjudicated

04:07:03.349 --> 04:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
adjudicated
 
04:07:05.269 --> 04:07:05.279 align:start position:0%
the lawyer for the licensee asked me if
 
04:07:07.030 --> 04:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
that is really one of what i wanted to
 
04:07:08.389 --> 04:07:08.399 align:start position:0%
see happen
 
04:07:10.550 --> 04:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
the issue being that these were all
 
04:07:12.710 --> 04:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
animal welfare violations
 
04:07:14.630 --> 04:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
this individual could continue in
 
04:07:16.950 --> 04:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
business without violating the law as
 
04:07:19.110 --> 04:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
long as they transferred fewer than 30
 
04:07:20.469 --> 04:07:20.479 align:start position:0%
dogs a year
 
04:07:22.710 --> 04:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
at 4 dollars
 
04:07:23.910 --> 04:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
a dog
 
04:07:25.510 --> 04:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
that would mean they could have an
 
04:07:25.520 --> 04:07:26.469 align:start position:0%
that would mean they could have an
income

04:07:26.469 --> 04:07:26.479 align:start position:0%
income
 
04:07:28.870 --> 04:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
of about a hundred and sixteen thousand
 
04:07:31.590 --> 04:07:31.600 align:start position:0%
dollars without being licensed and we
 
04:07:34.309 --> 04:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
would have no right to inspect the
 
04:07:36.389 --> 04:07:36.399 align:start position:0%
facility which is based in the owner's
 
04:07:36.399 --> 04:07:37.590 align:start position:0%
facility which is based in the owner's
home

04:07:37.590 --> 04:07:37.600 align:start position:0%
home
 
04:07:39.670 --> 04:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
so that's not a desirable situation
 
04:07:39.680 --> 04:07:40.950 align:start position:0%
so that's not a desirable situation
either

04:07:40.950 --> 04:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
either
 
04:07:43.189 --> 04:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
we are again in negotiations to ensure
 
04:07:45.590 --> 04:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
the best outcome for the dogs but this
 
04:07:47.910 --> 04:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
has been dragging on for months due to
 
04:07:49.830 --> 04:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
other pressing issues such as avian
 
04:07:49.840 --> 04:07:51.189 align:start position:0%
other pressing issues such as avian
influenza

04:07:51.189 --> 04:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
influenza
 
04:07:53.349 --> 04:07:53.359 align:start position:0%
this is just one example of why we need
 
04:07:55.830 --> 04:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
to free up staff time through the use of
 
04:07:57.269 --> 04:07:57.279 align:start position:0%
an unbiased
 
04:07:59.030 --> 04:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
contract hearings officer now i'm going
 
04:08:01.269 --> 04:08:01.279 align:start position:0%
to add lib here for for a minute i
 
04:08:04.870 --> 04:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
neglected to put this part in currently
 
04:08:07.429 --> 04:08:07.439 align:start position:0%
we do all the hearings in-house
 
04:08:09.910 --> 04:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
all-ish fines are issued under my
 
04:08:09.920 --> 04:08:11.349 align:start position:0%
all-ish fines are issued under my
authority

04:08:11.349 --> 04:08:11.359 align:start position:0%
authority
 
04:08:14.710 --> 04:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
however i sometimes as the rules allow
 
04:08:17.269 --> 04:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
act as the hearing officer but it's
 
04:08:18.870 --> 04:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
other times and i've said this in the
 
04:08:21.510 --> 04:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
email a director that will ask act in
 
04:08:23.830 --> 04:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
that place can you think of a more
 
04:08:25.510 --> 04:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
biased situation than that where
 
04:08:27.269 --> 04:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
co-workers i'm their
 
04:08:29.189 --> 04:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
actual supervisor
 
04:08:32.149 --> 04:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
and then i'm issuing fines well i think
 
04:08:34.469 --> 04:08:34.479 align:start position:0%
the fact of the matter is if you look at
 
04:08:36.550 --> 04:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
the fine letters and how we adjudicate
 
04:08:39.750 --> 04:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
it we do a fair job but on the surface
 
04:08:41.830 --> 04:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
no one would design a system that worked
 
04:08:43.670 --> 04:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
that way
 
04:08:45.510 --> 04:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
we can get into more issues in a work
 
04:08:47.189 --> 04:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
session but i felt it was important to
 
04:08:49.269 --> 04:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
put a few of these issues on the public
 
04:08:51.510 --> 04:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
record in closing that i will say that
 
04:08:53.429 --> 04:08:53.439 align:start position:0%
the email you received is probably the
 
04:08:55.590 --> 04:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
most inaccurate communication that i
 
04:08:58.229 --> 04:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
have ever seen sent to a committee
 
04:09:00.070 --> 04:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
what is truly important in this bill is
 
04:09:02.149 --> 04:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
the ability to contract within partial
 
04:09:04.790 --> 04:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
hearing officers the issue of the fine
 
04:09:07.110 --> 04:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
is much less important the history of
 
04:09:09.030 --> 04:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
the department is that we seldom if ever
 
04:09:11.590 --> 04:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
issue for fines for the maximum allowed
 
04:09:13.990 --> 04:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
by law however we do believe that there
 
04:09:15.990 --> 04:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
should be an increase in the fine for
 
04:09:18.229 --> 04:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
repeatedly transferring animals above
 
04:09:19.510 --> 04:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
the limit
 
04:09:21.429 --> 04:09:21.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and i'm happy to
 
04:09:23.429 --> 04:09:23.439 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you might have
 
04:09:25.189 --> 04:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner uh representative

thank you mr chair and thank you

commissioner for coming and speaking on
 
04:09:31.990 --> 04:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
this bill today
 
04:09:37.269 --> 04:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:40.830 --> 04:09:40.840 align:start position:0%
to refer these
 
04:09:43.269 --> 04:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
violations to the ag's office for
 
04:09:46.389 --> 04:09:46.399 align:start position:0%
enforcement i did did address that
 
04:09:50.469 --> 04:09:50.479 align:start position:0%
yesterday in in the email the age office
 
04:09:52.469 --> 04:09:52.479 align:start position:0%
consumer protection
 
04:09:54.550 --> 04:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
does not have the staff time to deal
 
04:09:56.229 --> 04:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
with these type of things they have so
 
04:09:59.269 --> 04:09:59.279 align:start position:0%
many the leadership in in doj has said
 
04:10:00.630 --> 04:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
to their staff
 
04:10:02.550 --> 04:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
we can't deal with this these are left
 
04:10:04.070 --> 04:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
to the local
 
04:10:05.349 --> 04:10:05.359 align:start position:0%
uh pd
 
04:10:07.030 --> 04:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
and this is two separate tracks by the
 
04:10:09.830 --> 04:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
way so don't confuse it's not an either
 
04:10:09.840 --> 04:10:11.670 align:start position:0%
way so don't confuse it's not an either
or

04:10:11.670 --> 04:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:10:13.830 --> 04:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
the violation is a misdemeanor that can
 
04:10:17.670 --> 04:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
be adjudicated the fine is in addition
 
04:10:17.680 --> 04:10:18.710 align:start position:0%
be adjudicated the fine is in addition
to

04:10:18.710 --> 04:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:10:20.229 --> 04:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
the misdemeanor
 
04:10:22.469 --> 04:10:22.479 align:start position:0%
one we have absolutely no control on i
 
04:10:25.110 --> 04:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
cannot force the local pd the county
 
04:10:28.469 --> 04:10:28.479 align:start position:0%
attorney or the dog j to do anything
 
04:10:30.710 --> 04:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
although any of those three entities
 
04:10:30.720 --> 04:10:31.910 align:start position:0%
although any of those three entities
could

04:10:31.910 --> 04:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
could
 
04:10:35.189 --> 04:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
they seldom do the only enforcement that
 
04:10:37.990 --> 04:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
we have as a department is through the
 
04:10:42.790 --> 04:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:45.269 --> 04:10:45.279 align:start position:0%
then could the legislature direct the
 
04:10:47.990 --> 04:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
ag's office to handle those cases
 
04:10:50.469 --> 04:10:50.479 align:start position:0%
you know i i if you want to give them
 
04:10:52.950 --> 04:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
more staff i think you would
 
04:10:55.269 --> 04:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
hear that they're backed up i mean we've
 
04:10:57.429 --> 04:10:57.439 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with this one that has
 
04:11:00.149 --> 04:11:00.159 align:start position:0%
been going on now for well over a year
 
04:11:03.269 --> 04:11:03.279 align:start position:0%
there just isn't the time out there
 
04:11:05.510 --> 04:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure that anybody is ever
 
04:11:07.349 --> 04:11:07.359 align:start position:0%
going to be put in jail
 
04:11:09.510 --> 04:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
for transferring pets so then where do
 
04:11:11.510 --> 04:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
you end up you end up in the same exact
 
04:11:11.520 --> 04:11:12.790 align:start position:0%
you end up you end up in the same exact
spot

04:11:12.790 --> 04:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
spot
 
04:11:14.710 --> 04:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
even though they you know a misdemeanor
 
04:11:16.950 --> 04:11:16.960 align:start position:0%
is what traditionally a thousand dollar
 
04:11:19.030 --> 04:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
fine or a year in jail
 
04:11:20.790 --> 04:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
um they're not going to go to jail no
 
04:11:22.229 --> 04:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
prosecutor is going to ask to send
 
04:11:24.790 --> 04:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
somebody to jail for selling a dog that
 
04:11:27.110 --> 04:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
i can see and we're left back in the
 
04:11:31.590 --> 04:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:33.510 --> 04:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
representative bixby
 
04:11:35.670 --> 04:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question
 
04:11:38.229 --> 04:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
uh one um
 
04:11:41.110 --> 04:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
one issue that was brought up was that
 
04:11:43.510 --> 04:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh so the it's a thousand dollars for
 
04:11:45.910 --> 04:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
the first offense and it is five
 
04:11:48.229 --> 04:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for subs subs subscribe
 
04:11:50.070 --> 04:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
to expen let me let me finish the
 
04:11:51.429 --> 04:11:51.439 align:start position:0%
question so
 
04:11:53.910 --> 04:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
i know that under cr uh in criminal
 
04:11:53.920 --> 04:11:54.950 align:start position:0%
i know that under cr uh in criminal
cases

04:11:54.950 --> 04:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
cases
 
04:11:57.429 --> 04:11:57.439 align:start position:0%
uh if there are multiple offenses that
 
04:11:59.750 --> 04:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
occur at the same time
 
04:12:02.389 --> 04:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
like uh with the case in wolfeboro where
 
04:12:06.070 --> 04:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
there were 75 uh negligent cruelty cases
 
04:12:07.830 --> 04:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
all of those cases were considered a
 
04:12:10.630 --> 04:12:10.640 align:start position:0%
first offense so in this situation is
 
04:12:13.349 --> 04:12:13.359 align:start position:0%
the fir if if someone sells
 
04:12:13.359 --> 04:12:14.070 align:start position:0%
the fir if if someone sells
uh

04:12:14.070 --> 04:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:12:15.990 --> 04:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
10 dogs and
 
04:12:17.910 --> 04:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
those are and those are are all at the
 
04:12:20.149 --> 04:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
same time would those be considered all
 
04:12:21.910 --> 04:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
the first off for our first offense or
 
04:12:23.670 --> 04:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
would that be one
 
04:12:26.070 --> 04:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar offense plus
 
04:12:28.870 --> 04:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
nine five thousand dollar offenses
 
04:12:31.670 --> 04:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
it's up to first of all in even though
 
04:12:34.229 --> 04:12:34.239 align:start position:0%
we have up to a thousand now i've never
 
04:12:36.870 --> 04:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
seen a case where we have issued
 
04:12:38.870 --> 04:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
the maximum
 
04:12:41.670 --> 04:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
allowed but i will say that unlike if we
 
04:12:43.990 --> 04:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
went in and did a uh an inspection of a
 
04:12:45.990 --> 04:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
facility i think
 
04:12:46.000 --> 04:12:47.269 align:start position:0%
facility i think
a

04:12:47.269 --> 04:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:12:49.910 --> 04:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
convincing argument could be made that
 
04:12:51.429 --> 04:12:51.439 align:start position:0%
all of those
 
04:12:53.830 --> 04:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
uh violations that might be
 
04:12:56.070 --> 04:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
found in an inspection would be a first
 
04:12:58.229 --> 04:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
offense punishable only up to a thousand
 
04:12:58.239 --> 04:12:59.910 align:start position:0%
offense punishable only up to a thousand
dollars

04:12:59.910 --> 04:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:13:02.149 --> 04:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
in the case of dogs they're not
 
04:13:02.159 --> 04:13:04.070 align:start position:0%
in the case of dogs they're not
transferred

04:13:04.070 --> 04:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
transferred
 
04:13:05.750 --> 04:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
in mass
 
04:13:08.550 --> 04:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
so i don't know that we see very often
 
04:13:11.030 --> 04:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
that 10 dogs are transferred to one
 
04:13:12.790 --> 04:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
person these are based on health
 
04:13:15.189 --> 04:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
certificates so each health certificate
 
04:13:15.199 --> 04:13:15.990 align:start position:0%
certificates so each health certificate
issued

04:13:15.990 --> 04:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
issued
 
04:13:17.670 --> 04:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
is a violation
 
04:13:20.070 --> 04:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
so while i don't think we would go from
 
04:13:21.750 --> 04:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
one thousand
 
04:13:23.750 --> 04:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
you know to five thousand for the second
 
04:13:25.910 --> 04:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
third fourth and fifth we could but
 
04:13:28.229 --> 04:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
those are clearly separate violations
 
04:13:30.550 --> 04:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
because they're separate transfers
 
04:13:32.950 --> 04:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
just like you don't get to get stopped
 
04:13:34.149 --> 04:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
for speeding
 
04:13:35.750 --> 04:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
in one town
 
04:13:37.910 --> 04:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
and then get stopped 10 minutes later
 
04:13:39.110 --> 04:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
for speeding
 
04:13:41.830 --> 04:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
um and say hey i've just been fine for
 
04:13:44.469 --> 04:13:44.479 align:start position:0%
for speeding 10 minutes ago
 
04:13:46.469 --> 04:13:46.479 align:start position:0%
you know they're separate violations for
 
04:13:50.469 --> 04:13:50.479 align:start position:0%
for separate acts thank you
 
04:13:52.309 --> 04:13:52.319 align:start position:0%
representative murray
 
04:13:53.670 --> 04:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair for taking my
 
04:13:56.309 --> 04:13:56.319 align:start position:0%
question thank you commissioner um one
 
04:13:58.070 --> 04:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
question i do have for you and maybe you
 
04:13:59.590 --> 04:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
can help me with this is it sounds like
 
04:14:01.269 --> 04:14:01.279 align:start position:0%
what you were explaining to me is that
 
04:14:03.030 --> 04:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
you are in fact
 
04:14:05.510 --> 04:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
your department is in charge of hearing
 
04:14:07.830 --> 04:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
this and then imposing the find my
 
04:14:09.830 --> 04:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
question to you is i know that in fish
 
04:14:11.429 --> 04:14:11.439 align:start position:0%
and game for example they have officers
 
04:14:13.349 --> 04:14:13.359 align:start position:0%
who oftentimes impose those fines or
 
04:14:15.510 --> 04:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
write a citation so to your knowledge
 
04:14:17.990 --> 04:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
does any other department
 
04:14:19.750 --> 04:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
operate the way you're describing it to
 
04:14:21.670 --> 04:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
us not that i've ever heard of and let
 
04:14:24.710 --> 04:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
me be clear what would continue is that
 
04:14:24.720 --> 04:14:26.309 align:start position:0%
me be clear what would continue is that
my

04:14:26.309 --> 04:14:26.319 align:start position:0%
my
 
04:14:26.319 --> 04:14:27.030 align:start position:0%
my
my

04:14:27.030 --> 04:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
my
 
04:14:27.040 --> 04:14:28.630 align:start position:0%
my
personnel

04:14:28.630 --> 04:14:28.640 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
04:14:30.469 --> 04:14:30.479 align:start position:0%
would go out they would do the
 
04:14:33.189 --> 04:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
inspections they would write the letters
 
04:14:35.590 --> 04:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
they would issue the fine
 
04:14:37.590 --> 04:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
then it would stop it would go to a
 
04:14:39.830 --> 04:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
hearing officer who would then schedule
 
04:14:41.830 --> 04:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
that would here they would not be able
 
04:14:44.389 --> 04:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
to issue additional fines they would not
 
04:14:46.790 --> 04:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
be able to increase the fines all they
 
04:14:48.389 --> 04:14:48.399 align:start position:0%
would be able to do
 
04:14:51.830 --> 04:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
is potentially uphold the fines that
 
04:14:54.389 --> 04:14:54.399 align:start position:0%
were issued by the personnel or reduce
 
04:14:56.870 --> 04:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
them in most cases we do reduce the
 
04:14:56.880 --> 04:14:57.830 align:start position:0%
them in most cases we do reduce the
fines

04:14:57.830 --> 04:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
fines
 
04:14:59.189 --> 04:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
there was one
 
04:15:01.830 --> 04:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
case where i recently was the hearing
 
04:15:04.550 --> 04:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
officer where we tried very hard
 
04:15:06.790 --> 04:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
to have a negotiated settlement and
 
04:15:09.189 --> 04:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
reduce the fine and that person would
 
04:15:12.389 --> 04:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
not agree to the fine so i upheld the
 
04:15:14.309 --> 04:15:14.319 align:start position:0%
fine they they paid the original one but
 
04:15:15.990 --> 04:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
in all the other cases
 
04:15:18.550 --> 04:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
there has been probable there have been
 
04:15:21.269 --> 04:15:21.279 align:start position:0%
section portions of the fines that i
 
04:15:22.790 --> 04:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
have suspended
 
04:15:25.269 --> 04:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
pending good behavior but that's what
 
04:15:26.950 --> 04:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
the hearing officer would do and so
 
04:15:29.110 --> 04:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
there's a very clear and bright line
 
04:15:31.590 --> 04:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
they would have no relationship with the
 
04:15:33.269 --> 04:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
uh with the department other than
 
04:15:33.279 --> 04:15:34.870 align:start position:0%
uh with the department other than
contractual

04:15:34.870 --> 04:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
contractual
 
04:15:36.229 --> 04:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:15:37.990 --> 04:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
you know i think it's a much better you
 
04:15:39.429 --> 04:15:39.439 align:start position:0%
know you know
 
04:15:41.830 --> 04:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
a a fairer system than what we're we're
 
04:15:43.269 --> 04:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
doing now i've never been comfortable
 
04:15:44.710 --> 04:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
what we're doing but that's what's laid
 
04:15:46.389 --> 04:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
out for us and that's all that's
 
04:15:48.309 --> 04:15:48.319 align:start position:0%
available to us
 
04:15:50.870 --> 04:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:52.870 --> 04:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
representative compta
 
04:15:53.990 --> 04:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
04:15:56.469 --> 04:15:56.479 align:start position:0%
commissioner for taking my question
 
04:15:56.479 --> 04:15:58.830 align:start position:0%
commissioner for taking my question
um

04:15:58.830 --> 04:15:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:02.950 --> 04:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
so i'm a little confused um as to what's
 
04:16:05.670 --> 04:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
going on with this particular vendor um
 
04:16:07.670 --> 04:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
they're getting health certificates does
 
04:16:10.070 --> 04:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
that mean the dogs are healthy is that
 
04:16:12.870 --> 04:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
how we're tracking this person
 
04:16:14.630 --> 04:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
they are getting they are getting health
 
04:16:15.590 --> 04:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
certificates they're going to their
 
04:16:18.229 --> 04:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
veterinarian dogs are being examined
 
04:16:20.630 --> 04:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
health certificates are being issued the
 
04:16:22.550 --> 04:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
veterinarian is doing nothing wrong has
 
04:16:24.870 --> 04:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
no ability to say well you've already
 
04:16:26.870 --> 04:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
transferred so many without a license
 
04:16:29.349 --> 04:16:29.359 align:start position:0%
that's not his his thing his obligation
 
04:16:31.510 --> 04:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
is when we ask him because we're still
 
04:16:32.790 --> 04:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
working on the
 
04:16:35.349 --> 04:16:35.359 align:start position:0%
um the database that was approved
 
04:16:37.830 --> 04:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
um and that request for information has
 
04:16:39.269 --> 04:16:39.279 align:start position:0%
gone out we are working there but we're
 
04:16:41.590 --> 04:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
still a long way away so we now
 
04:16:43.110 --> 04:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
we can't get
 
04:16:45.189 --> 04:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
all of we can't deal with all of the
 
04:16:47.189 --> 04:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
health certificates but when we become
 
04:16:49.189 --> 04:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
aware of a problem like this we make the
 
04:16:52.070 --> 04:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
request to the veterinarians in the area
 
04:16:54.630 --> 04:16:54.640 align:start position:0%
who we suspect may be issuing health
 
04:16:56.630 --> 04:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
certificates and that's the only way we
 
04:16:57.990 --> 04:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
can figure out if somebody is in
 
04:17:00.070 --> 04:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
violation other than that we really
 
04:17:03.429 --> 04:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
don't have any way of knowing
 
04:17:03.439 --> 04:17:04.710 align:start position:0%
don't have any way of knowing
recently

04:17:04.710 --> 04:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
recently
 
04:17:08.309 --> 04:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
i did get a call or an email from a
 
04:17:10.309 --> 04:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
police department who became aware of
 
04:17:10.319 --> 04:17:11.349 align:start position:0%
police department who became aware of
people

04:17:11.349 --> 04:17:11.359 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:17:12.950 --> 04:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
transferring animals without health
 
04:17:12.960 --> 04:17:14.389 align:start position:0%
transferring animals without health
certificates

04:17:14.389 --> 04:17:14.399 align:start position:0%
certificates
 
04:17:16.070 --> 04:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
now here's the interesting thing in law
 
04:17:17.349 --> 04:17:17.359 align:start position:0%
which would probably be something i'll
 
04:17:19.429 --> 04:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
ask you to look at next year
 
04:17:22.149 --> 04:17:22.159 align:start position:0%
is it is a violation
 
04:17:24.550 --> 04:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
to transfer animals without a health
 
04:17:27.030 --> 04:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
certificate but there is no penalty for
 
04:17:29.750 --> 04:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:32.229 --> 04:17:32.239 align:start position:0%
so you don't actually have to have a
 
04:17:34.469 --> 04:17:34.479 align:start position:0%
health certificate and you know i can't
 
04:17:36.229 --> 04:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
stop anybody from doing that all i can
 
04:17:37.670 --> 04:17:37.680 align:start position:0%
it's a violation and if they don't care
 
04:17:39.910 --> 04:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
they're violating the law then nobody in
 
04:17:45.269 --> 04:17:45.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:45.279 --> 04:17:46.229 align:start position:0%
 
follow

04:17:46.229 --> 04:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
follow
 
04:17:47.349 --> 04:17:47.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
04:17:47.359 --> 04:17:49.510 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
commissioner

04:17:49.510 --> 04:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
04:17:49.520 --> 04:17:51.269 align:start position:0%
commissioner
so

04:17:51.269 --> 04:17:51.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:17:52.950 --> 04:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to wrap my head around this
 
04:17:54.229 --> 04:17:54.239 align:start position:0%
one so they're getting a health
 
04:17:55.910 --> 04:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
certificate which means the veterinarian
 
04:17:57.990 --> 04:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
is deeming that these puppies
 
04:18:00.950 --> 04:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
or dogs are healthy
 
04:18:02.229 --> 04:18:02.239 align:start position:0%
but the problem that you're saying is
 
04:18:03.750 --> 04:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
that they're transferring more than 30
 
04:18:03.760 --> 04:18:05.189 align:start position:0%
that they're transferring more than 30
dogs

04:18:05.189 --> 04:18:05.199 align:start position:0%
dogs
 
04:18:08.710 --> 04:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
the in some cases yes the legislature
 
04:18:10.550 --> 04:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
has set the limit to say what a pet
 
04:18:12.710 --> 04:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
vendor was it used to be 50
 
04:18:14.870 --> 04:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
brought it down to 25 brought it back to
 
04:18:18.309 --> 04:18:18.319 align:start position:0%
30. that's a legislative decision
 
04:18:20.950 --> 04:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
legislature has said that in order
 
04:18:22.870 --> 04:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
if you meet that criteria you're a pet
 
04:18:24.790 --> 04:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
vendor and then you come under licensure
 
04:18:26.309 --> 04:18:26.319 align:start position:0%
and inspection
 
04:18:28.469 --> 04:18:28.479 align:start position:0%
of of the facilities but we have people
 
04:18:29.590 --> 04:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
that are
 
04:18:32.469 --> 04:18:32.479 align:start position:0%
you know not becoming licensed and they
 
04:18:35.189 --> 04:18:35.199 align:start position:0%
are not their facilities are not subject
 
04:18:37.429 --> 04:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
to inspection now
 
04:18:39.110 --> 04:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
you have to be clear that there are two
 
04:18:41.510 --> 04:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
different things here a dog can be
 
04:18:41.520 --> 04:18:43.110 align:start position:0%
different things here a dog can be
healthy

04:18:43.110 --> 04:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
healthy
 
04:18:45.110 --> 04:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
and still be filthy and can be brought
 
04:18:46.950 --> 04:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
up in filthy conditions
 
04:18:48.630 --> 04:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
and improper
 
04:18:50.870 --> 04:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
they're free of disease that's all it
 
04:18:52.389 --> 04:18:52.399 align:start position:0%
really means
 
04:18:54.229 --> 04:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
when they have a health certificate not
 
04:18:55.830 --> 04:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
that they're well cared for or anything
 
04:18:55.840 --> 04:18:57.189 align:start position:0%
that they're well cared for or anything
else

04:18:57.189 --> 04:18:57.199 align:start position:0%
else
 
04:18:59.830 --> 04:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
and the legislature has determined that
 
04:19:03.030 --> 04:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
at this limit we want these
 
04:19:04.790 --> 04:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
these criteria met
 
04:19:06.870 --> 04:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
now i will tell you if you know if you
 
04:19:08.790 --> 04:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
don't have a problem with that everyone
 
04:19:10.870 --> 04:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
in the department of agriculture would
 
04:19:12.389 --> 04:19:12.399 align:start position:0%
be thrilled if you just did away with a
 
04:19:14.630 --> 04:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
pet vending statue
 
04:19:16.550 --> 04:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
you know this isn't something i want
 
04:19:18.229 --> 04:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
this isn't something my veterinarians
 
04:19:20.950 --> 04:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
want or anything this is
 
04:19:22.790 --> 04:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
the biggest problem
 
04:19:25.269 --> 04:19:25.279 align:start position:0%
other than avian influenza at the moment
 
04:19:28.550 --> 04:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
that the department faces day in and day
 
04:19:28.560 --> 04:19:29.349 align:start position:0%
that the department faces day in and day
out

04:19:29.349 --> 04:19:29.359 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:19:31.349 --> 04:19:31.359 align:start position:0%
and we have to do something this is an
 
04:19:33.830 --> 04:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
incredible waste of
 
04:19:36.950 --> 04:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
services i think the state of maine
 
04:19:40.550 --> 04:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
has a staff of almost 30 people
 
04:19:42.469 --> 04:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
doing nothing but dealing with pet
 
04:19:45.269 --> 04:19:45.279 align:start position:0%
vending i have received one dedicated
 
04:19:48.309 --> 04:19:48.319 align:start position:0%
person for pet funding
 
04:19:48.319 --> 04:19:49.349 align:start position:0%
person for pet funding
paul

04:19:49.349 --> 04:19:49.359 align:start position:0%
paul
 
04:19:50.469 --> 04:19:50.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
04:19:52.710 --> 04:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner for that explanation
 
04:19:56.149 --> 04:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
so basically what you're saying is that
 
04:20:00.229 --> 04:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
this particular case that you have a
 
04:20:01.429 --> 04:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
drawer full
 
04:20:03.990 --> 04:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
of paperwork it's not because they're
 
04:20:05.670 --> 04:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
not getting the transfer papers and the
 
04:20:07.510 --> 04:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
health certificate it's because of the
 
04:20:10.469 --> 04:20:10.479 align:start position:0%
living conditions of the puppies
 
04:20:13.110 --> 04:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
no no what i'm saying is they have
 
04:20:15.990 --> 04:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
they can't be licensed by their town
 
04:20:17.590 --> 04:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
because they do not live in a zone that
 
04:20:19.590 --> 04:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
allows them to
 
04:20:20.550 --> 04:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
have a
 
04:20:20.560 --> 04:20:22.149 align:start position:0%
have a
kennel

04:20:22.149 --> 04:20:22.159 align:start position:0%
kennel
 
04:20:24.149 --> 04:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
and so they just continue to do what
 
04:20:27.030 --> 04:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
they want to do and thus far
 
04:20:28.469 --> 04:20:28.479 align:start position:0%
there really has been nothing that
 
04:20:30.309 --> 04:20:30.319 align:start position:0%
anybody has been able to do about it now
 
04:20:32.309 --> 04:20:32.319 align:start position:0%
they are facing court case i don't want
 
04:20:33.910 --> 04:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
you to think this is the only one and
 
04:20:34.870 --> 04:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
the only
 
04:20:35.990 --> 04:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
04:20:38.229 --> 04:20:38.239 align:start position:0%
this is the most extreme case
 
04:20:39.990 --> 04:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
but it takes up a lot of time it's been
 
04:20:42.149 --> 04:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
ongoing for 15 years and there are
 
04:20:45.030 --> 04:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
others we are just at our wit's end
 
04:20:47.349 --> 04:20:47.359 align:start position:0%
about what to do because we're not able
 
04:20:50.149 --> 04:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
to do the inspections on all the license
 
04:20:52.229 --> 04:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
facilities in the manner that we should
 
04:20:54.389 --> 04:20:54.399 align:start position:0%
be because of the times that are taking
 
04:20:54.399 --> 04:20:55.030 align:start position:0%
be because of the times that are taking
up

04:20:55.030 --> 04:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
up
 
04:20:57.830 --> 04:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
we are are simply in failure
 
04:20:59.590 --> 04:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
when it comes to pet vending we have
 
04:21:02.710 --> 04:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
been in failure when it was 50.
 
04:21:05.429 --> 04:21:05.439 align:start position:0%
we are more in failure now
 
04:21:06.870 --> 04:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm just saying
 
04:21:09.429 --> 04:21:09.439 align:start position:0%
please don't ask us to continue to
 
04:21:11.670 --> 04:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
operate in failure i'm not asking for
 
04:21:12.870 --> 04:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
more money
 
04:21:15.030 --> 04:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not asking for more people
 
04:21:17.510 --> 04:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
i'm asking to allow us to use a portion
 
04:21:19.110 --> 04:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
of that fine money
 
04:21:23.030 --> 04:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
to be able to hire people who can then
 
04:21:25.830 --> 04:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
free up a substantial amount of time it
 
04:21:29.590 --> 04:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
takes hours and hours and hours to deal
 
04:21:32.229 --> 04:21:32.239 align:start position:0%
with each hearing that we have
 
04:21:34.630 --> 04:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
so this is about those hearings but
 
04:21:36.309 --> 04:21:36.319 align:start position:0%
you know there are just so many moving
 
04:21:39.349 --> 04:21:39.359 align:start position:0%
parts we are in failure
 
04:21:41.750 --> 04:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
and i have a solution that costs you
 
04:21:41.760 --> 04:21:42.790 align:start position:0%
and i have a solution that costs you
nothing

04:21:42.790 --> 04:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
04:21:45.030 --> 04:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
now will it possibly take some money out
 
04:21:47.510 --> 04:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
of the general fund potentially could it
 
04:21:49.830 --> 04:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
add more there potentially but let's
 
04:21:52.950 --> 04:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
face it we were what 60 million above
 
04:21:55.189 --> 04:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
um estimates last month
 
04:21:58.070 --> 04:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
and we're talking about maybe worst case
 
04:21:58.080 --> 04:21:59.510 align:start position:0%
and we're talking about maybe worst case
scenario

04:21:59.510 --> 04:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
scenario
 
04:22:02.070 --> 04:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
you know 80 90 000 and i don't see that
 
04:22:03.670 --> 04:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
there's any way i'm going to have
 
04:22:03.680 --> 04:22:04.870 align:start position:0%
there's any way i'm going to have
contracts

04:22:04.870 --> 04:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
contracts
 
04:22:06.870 --> 04:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
anywhere near that amount
 
04:22:08.229 --> 04:22:08.239 align:start position:0%
frankly but
 
04:22:10.070 --> 04:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
you know you've put us in
 
04:22:12.309 --> 04:22:12.319 align:start position:0%
you being the legislature have put us in
 
04:22:14.790 --> 04:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
an impossible situation
 
04:22:17.030 --> 04:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
i want out one way or another either
 
04:22:18.710 --> 04:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
with a solution or just say hey we don't
 
04:22:20.710 --> 04:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
care who pat transfers animals and how
 
04:22:22.550 --> 04:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
they do it
 
04:22:24.070 --> 04:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
so a couple of things that come to my
 
04:22:27.030 --> 04:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
mind if this is a zoning issue has their
 
04:22:29.110 --> 04:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
town taken any administrative action on
 
04:22:30.790 --> 04:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
their part as far as issuing a cease and
 
04:22:32.710 --> 04:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
desist absolutely they've gone to court
 
04:22:35.750 --> 04:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:38.070 --> 04:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
it's you know they've been there
 
04:22:40.870 --> 04:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
and arrested her twice
 
04:22:42.710 --> 04:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
she's been arrested twice
 
04:22:42.720 --> 04:22:43.910 align:start position:0%
she's been arrested twice
yeah

04:22:43.910 --> 04:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:22:45.030 --> 04:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
so i'm
 
04:22:46.630 --> 04:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
change that that's just one that's just
 
04:22:48.469 --> 04:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
one example don't think right if that
 
04:22:49.910 --> 04:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
one person went away that would solve
 
04:22:51.429 --> 04:22:51.439 align:start position:0%
all our problems we'll change the topic
 
04:22:54.149 --> 04:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
of hair to the fiscal note and um look
 
04:22:56.229 --> 04:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
into that just a little bit so
 
04:22:58.070 --> 04:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
i i was a little confused when i first
 
04:22:59.990 --> 04:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
read the fiscal note and perhaps you can
 
04:23:02.229 --> 04:23:02.239 align:start position:0%
just give a little clarity so it appears
 
04:23:03.830 --> 04:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
what you're looking for is to use
 
04:23:06.229 --> 04:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
current fines that you already rece the
 
04:23:07.910 --> 04:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
department is already receiving from
 
04:23:10.790 --> 04:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
areas other than the animal department
 
04:23:12.630 --> 04:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
and you just want to allow the fines
 
04:23:14.950 --> 04:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
that come from
 
04:23:16.550 --> 04:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
this to be included with those other
 
04:23:19.030 --> 04:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
fines to go to hiring this contracted
 
04:23:21.189 --> 04:23:21.199 align:start position:0%
position am i understanding correctly
 
04:23:23.189 --> 04:23:23.199 align:start position:0%
you are and thank you for that question
 
04:23:25.830 --> 04:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
chairman pearl um and i should have
 
04:23:28.070 --> 04:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
clarified that a little bit so weights
 
04:23:30.710 --> 04:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
and measures actually brings in a lot
 
04:23:32.630 --> 04:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
more fine money
 
04:23:32.640 --> 04:23:33.590 align:start position:0%
more fine money
than

04:23:33.590 --> 04:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
than
 
04:23:35.349 --> 04:23:35.359 align:start position:0%
animal industry
 
04:23:37.510 --> 04:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
specifically pet vending
 
04:23:40.309 --> 04:23:40.319 align:start position:0%
but we primarily the the
 
04:23:43.110 --> 04:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
areas where we see fines are primarily
 
04:23:44.790 --> 04:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
in weights and measures
 
04:23:46.469 --> 04:23:46.479 align:start position:0%
in an animal industry
 
04:23:48.950 --> 04:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
very little in in any of the other
 
04:23:51.510 --> 04:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
divisions some in plant industry
 
04:23:54.070 --> 04:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
most of those don't result in hearings
 
04:23:56.790 --> 04:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
most of those are resolved through
 
04:23:58.710 --> 04:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
negotiations before they ever get to a
 
04:23:58.720 --> 04:23:59.910 align:start position:0%
negotiations before they ever get to a
hearing

04:23:59.910 --> 04:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
04:23:59.920 --> 04:24:01.269 align:start position:0%
hearing
um

04:24:01.269 --> 04:24:01.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:03.670 --> 04:24:03.680 align:start position:0%
and so when when you're told oh animal
 
04:24:05.269 --> 04:24:05.279 align:start position:0%
industry is going to be supporting or
 
04:24:06.550 --> 04:24:06.560 align:start position:0%
pet vendors are going to be supporting
 
04:24:08.830 --> 04:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
hearings for others that's simply not
 
04:24:12.149 --> 04:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
true the the person has no idea how how
 
04:24:13.510 --> 04:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
we operate
 
04:24:13.520 --> 04:24:14.389 align:start position:0%
we operate
um

04:24:14.389 --> 04:24:14.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:16.790 --> 04:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
but the pet vending part of it is the
 
04:24:19.830 --> 04:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
most contentious even though we bring in
 
04:24:21.670 --> 04:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
more money in in other areas those
 
04:24:23.910 --> 04:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
people okay i get it they pay their fine
 
04:24:26.229 --> 04:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
they move on
 
04:24:27.110 --> 04:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
and this
 
04:24:29.349 --> 04:24:29.359 align:start position:0%
is where we get into the really bogged
 
04:24:29.359 --> 04:24:30.950 align:start position:0%
is where we get into the really bogged
down

04:24:30.950 --> 04:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
down
 
04:24:30.960 --> 04:24:32.469 align:start position:0%
down
areas

04:24:32.469 --> 04:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
areas
 
04:24:33.990 --> 04:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:24:36.149 --> 04:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
representative aaron thank you mr chair
 
04:24:38.229 --> 04:24:38.239 align:start position:0%
and thank you uh commissioner for taking
 
04:24:39.830 --> 04:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
my question
 
04:24:39.840 --> 04:24:40.870 align:start position:0%
my question
so

04:24:40.870 --> 04:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:24:42.469 --> 04:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm a little
 
04:24:44.550 --> 04:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not familiar with this so i'm a
 
04:24:46.309 --> 04:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
little confused about i mean we have all
 
04:24:48.070 --> 04:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
four divisions the animal industry
 
04:24:50.389 --> 04:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
pesticide control regulatory services
 
04:24:53.110 --> 04:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
weights and measures they all
 
04:24:56.229 --> 04:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
generate administrative fines
 
04:24:59.510 --> 04:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
is are all of those administrative fines
 
04:25:01.269 --> 04:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
placed in one fund
 
04:25:03.189 --> 04:25:03.199 align:start position:0%
they would be right now they are simply
 
04:25:04.550 --> 04:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
when the money comes in it goes to the
 
04:25:06.469 --> 04:25:06.479 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
04:25:08.469 --> 04:25:08.479 align:start position:0%
okay so there are you know
 
04:25:11.269 --> 04:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
multiple more than four divisions but
 
04:25:13.349 --> 04:25:13.359 align:start position:0%
generally regulatory and pesticides
 
04:25:15.429 --> 04:25:15.439 align:start position:0%
don't end up with a lot of
 
04:25:17.830 --> 04:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
um fining it's really
 
04:25:20.550 --> 04:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
the three divisions that tend to have
 
04:25:23.269 --> 04:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
some some fine money coming in the bulk
 
04:25:25.750 --> 04:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
of this coming from wages so a follow-up
 
04:25:27.990 --> 04:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
question would be wouldn't it be better
 
04:25:31.349 --> 04:25:31.359 align:start position:0%
to change the way in which
 
04:25:33.349 --> 04:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
we're collecting those fines make those
 
04:25:36.389 --> 04:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:38.950 --> 04:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
raise the fines across the board for all
 
04:25:40.790 --> 04:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
of those
 
04:25:42.950 --> 04:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:25:44.309 --> 04:25:44.319 align:start position:0%
that would help
 
04:25:46.550 --> 04:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
perhaps fund more
 
04:25:49.269 --> 04:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
the issue and cost of of these hearing
 
04:25:51.990 --> 04:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
officers for any of no no well no
 
04:25:54.710 --> 04:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
because currently and and i don't like
 
04:25:57.510 --> 04:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
the idea of find money staying within a
 
04:26:00.229 --> 04:26:00.239 align:start position:0%
department and so this doesn't
 
04:26:02.389 --> 04:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
really because it's going whatever we
 
04:26:04.950 --> 04:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
need is only being expended to hire the
 
04:26:06.710 --> 04:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
hearing officers you know i think we're
 
04:26:08.870 --> 04:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
all familiar with how
 
04:26:08.880 --> 04:26:09.990 align:start position:0%
all familiar with how
georgia

04:26:09.990 --> 04:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
georgia
 
04:26:12.630 --> 04:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
funds their their towns you know you get
 
04:26:14.630 --> 04:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
a speed trap and that money stays in
 
04:26:16.550 --> 04:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
coffers new hampshire doesn't operate
 
04:26:18.790 --> 04:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
that way i also don't think i need a
 
04:26:20.630 --> 04:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
full-time hearing officer so i don't
 
04:26:23.349 --> 04:26:23.359 align:start position:0%
want to ask for a position i also see
 
04:26:25.030 --> 04:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
that as somewhat of a conflict because
 
04:26:26.550 --> 04:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
that person is still going to work for
 
04:26:26.560 --> 04:26:27.750 align:start position:0%
that person is still going to work for
me

04:26:27.750 --> 04:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
me
 
04:26:30.710 --> 04:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
and be responsible to me a hearing
 
04:26:33.670 --> 04:26:33.680 align:start position:0%
officer is a contracted relationship
 
04:26:33.680 --> 04:26:34.630 align:start position:0%
officer is a contracted relationship
and

04:26:34.630 --> 04:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:26:36.790 --> 04:26:36.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't have that same relationship with
 
04:26:39.590 --> 04:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
me or a division head or any anybody
 
04:26:42.149 --> 04:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
else and it's only as needed
 
04:26:45.510 --> 04:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
and so we don't need to raise the fines
 
04:26:47.750 --> 04:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
other places the only you know and i
 
04:26:50.309 --> 04:26:50.319 align:start position:0%
don't care if you raise don't raise the
 
04:26:50.319 --> 04:26:51.349 align:start position:0%
don't care if you raise don't raise the
fines

04:26:51.349 --> 04:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
fines
 
04:26:53.030 --> 04:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
particularly if you want to rewrite the
 
04:26:54.870 --> 04:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
bill and on anything to do with the
 
04:26:56.550 --> 04:26:56.560 align:start position:0%
facilities you don't raid the raise the
 
04:26:59.110 --> 04:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
fine the problem is as long as you can
 
04:27:01.189 --> 04:27:01.199 align:start position:0%
sell a dog for four thousand dollars and
 
04:27:03.750 --> 04:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
only be fined a thousand dollars
 
04:27:05.590 --> 04:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
i'll do that all day long i don't know
 
04:27:06.710 --> 04:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
about you
 
04:27:08.229 --> 04:27:08.239 align:start position:0%
but if if i don't have to have
 
04:27:10.710 --> 04:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
inspections i don't have to be licensed
 
04:27:13.030 --> 04:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
and i can still have that three thousand
 
04:27:14.870 --> 04:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
dollar profit per animal
 
04:27:17.110 --> 04:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty good deal
 
04:27:19.110 --> 04:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
and that's why that part of it needs to
 
04:27:21.349 --> 04:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
be a disincentive so that people will
 
04:27:23.830 --> 04:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
want to come in compliance with the law
 
04:27:26.389 --> 04:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
that not i have passed but
 
04:27:28.229 --> 04:27:28.239 align:start position:0%
you have passed
 
04:27:29.830 --> 04:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
all right so for the benefit of the
 
04:27:31.750 --> 04:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
committee here i i know there's many
 
04:27:33.269 --> 04:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
more questions and there's there's
 
04:27:34.710 --> 04:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
certainly some work that we're going to
 
04:27:36.469 --> 04:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
need to do on this bill
 
04:27:38.070 --> 04:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
i'm going to uh i'm going to ask that
 
04:27:39.590 --> 04:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
the committee hold the rest of their
 
04:27:41.670 --> 04:27:41.680 align:start position:0%
questions and i'm until next tuesday and
 
04:27:43.349 --> 04:27:43.359 align:start position:0%
i'm going to schedule a work session on
 
04:27:44.469 --> 04:27:44.479 align:start position:0%
this because we are going to run out of
 
04:27:46.070 --> 04:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
time and we have some bills today that i
 
04:27:49.910 --> 04:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
have to act on on exec committee
 
04:27:51.830 --> 04:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
a procedural point on
 
04:27:54.469 --> 04:27:54.479 align:start position:0%
turn your mic a procedural point uh i
 
04:27:56.630 --> 04:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
think rather than scheduling a work
 
04:27:58.950 --> 04:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
session it probably is procedurally
 
04:28:00.389 --> 04:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
appropriate to can schedule a
 
04:28:02.389 --> 04:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
continuation of the hearing
 
04:28:03.830 --> 04:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
well we could do that but i think
 
04:28:05.269 --> 04:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
honestly with our own agreement we've
 
04:28:06.469 --> 04:28:06.479 align:start position:0%
got a little bit of work that we need to
 
04:28:08.550 --> 04:28:08.560 align:start position:0%
do on this um
 
04:28:10.070 --> 04:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
we can we can decide which way
 
04:28:11.750 --> 04:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
procedurally is better but we'll we'll
 
04:28:13.830 --> 04:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
definitely need to do some more on this
 
04:28:15.910 --> 04:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
okay i would just consult with paul
 
04:28:17.510 --> 04:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
about what that and
 
04:28:18.870 --> 04:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
i will do that today about the
 
04:28:21.030 --> 04:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
distinction between a work session so
 
04:28:22.710 --> 04:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
i'll just consult with paul to make sure
 
04:28:24.309 --> 04:28:24.319 align:start position:0%
that it gets scheduled appropriately
 
04:28:25.990 --> 04:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
with house rules i will do that thank
 
04:28:27.990 --> 04:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
you i appreciate that
 
04:28:28.950 --> 04:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
all right commissioner we're going to
 
04:28:31.110 --> 04:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
let you go for now and um we've got one
 
04:28:32.229 --> 04:28:32.239 align:start position:0%
more card and then we're going to have
 
04:28:33.910 --> 04:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
to go into an exact session here within
 
04:28:36.070 --> 04:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
about the next five minutes so
 
04:28:38.389 --> 04:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
i'll call on angela ferrari from the dog
 
04:28:56.630 --> 04:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:58.149 --> 04:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
all right sure you can just leave them
 
04:29:00.950 --> 04:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
there and we'll pass them around
 
04:29:02.229 --> 04:29:02.239 align:start position:0%
and i'll try and
 
04:29:03.830 --> 04:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
keep this short in the interest of
 
04:29:05.750 --> 04:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
everybody's time and there was a lot of
 
04:29:08.309 --> 04:29:08.319 align:start position:0%
questions raised that
 
04:29:10.309 --> 04:29:10.319 align:start position:0%
um i have as well
 
04:29:12.710 --> 04:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
one thing and angela ferrari dog owners
 
04:29:14.229 --> 04:29:14.239 align:start position:0%
of the granite state thank you very much
 
04:29:15.670 --> 04:29:15.680 align:start position:0%
for your time today
 
04:29:15.680 --> 04:29:16.710 align:start position:0%
for your time today
um

04:29:16.710 --> 04:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:18.149 --> 04:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
one thing i just want to hit on that was
 
04:29:19.590 --> 04:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
most recently discussed by the
 
04:29:21.269 --> 04:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
commissioner was
 
04:29:23.349 --> 04:29:23.359 align:start position:0%
for those who may be selling a dog for
 
04:29:25.030 --> 04:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
four thousand dollars
 
04:29:27.510 --> 04:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
minus a one thousand dollar fee does not
 
04:29:30.229 --> 04:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
equal three thousand dollars profit and
 
04:29:31.910 --> 04:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
they're happy
 
04:29:34.149 --> 04:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
raising dogs breeding them everything
 
04:29:36.469 --> 04:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
the care that goes into them is a very
 
04:29:36.479 --> 04:29:37.670 align:start position:0%
the care that goes into them is a very
expensive

04:29:37.670 --> 04:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
04:29:39.429 --> 04:29:39.439 align:start position:0%
line of work
 
04:29:43.189 --> 04:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
and is it is not just all profit so a 1
 
04:29:45.750 --> 04:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
000 fee would definitely be detrimental
 
04:29:48.630 --> 04:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
to most breeders who are even able to
 
04:29:52.469 --> 04:29:52.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:54.229 --> 04:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
one other thing i wanted to
 
04:29:57.110 --> 04:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
bring up was that in discussions
 
04:29:58.870 --> 04:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
previously with the commissioner he had
 
04:30:01.510 --> 04:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned that fines were typically not
 
04:30:03.750 --> 04:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
being paid and were being ignored at the
 
04:30:06.469 --> 04:30:06.479 align:start position:0%
current rate that they even are so i
 
04:30:08.149 --> 04:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
thought it was a bit curious that the
 
04:30:10.229 --> 04:30:10.239 align:start position:0%
direction of this bill as it has been
 
04:30:13.510 --> 04:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
amended is to just increase the fines
 
04:30:15.990 --> 04:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that we would actually see
 
04:30:18.630 --> 04:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
compliance come out of that since the
 
04:30:21.750 --> 04:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
issues that have been at hand are those
 
04:30:22.870 --> 04:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
who are
 
04:30:24.710 --> 04:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
having a blatant disregard for the
 
04:30:27.510 --> 04:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
requirements to get licensed or legally
 
04:30:30.630 --> 04:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
sell animals in new hampshire
 
04:30:33.030 --> 04:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
also as mentioned by representative
 
04:30:35.670 --> 04:30:35.680 align:start position:0%
bixby regarding the violations and what
 
04:30:38.229 --> 04:30:38.239 align:start position:0%
would be a subsequent violation
 
04:30:40.229 --> 04:30:40.239 align:start position:0%
we do read the bill that
 
04:30:42.630 --> 04:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
an initial transfer of a puppy would be
 
04:30:44.710 --> 04:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
the one thousand dollar fine and any
 
04:30:47.590 --> 04:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
subsequent puppy transfer would
 
04:30:49.830 --> 04:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
allow up to five thousand dollars per
 
04:30:49.840 --> 04:30:50.950 align:start position:0%
allow up to five thousand dollars per
transfer

04:30:50.950 --> 04:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
transfer
 
04:30:53.189 --> 04:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
and for a litter of ten puppies for
 
04:30:55.030 --> 04:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
example as mentioned by representative
 
04:30:57.510 --> 04:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
bixby that could be up to forty six
 
04:31:01.429 --> 04:31:01.439 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars just in fines alone
 
04:31:04.469 --> 04:31:04.479 align:start position:0%
what i see as a unintended consequence
 
04:31:07.030 --> 04:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
of the increase in these fines is the
 
04:31:09.830 --> 04:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
avoidance of transferring puppies to
 
04:31:12.229 --> 04:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
avoid these fines
 
04:31:14.710 --> 04:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
to avoid having to pay that 46 thousand
 
04:31:14.720 --> 04:31:15.670 align:start position:0%
to avoid having to pay that 46 thousand
dollars

04:31:15.670 --> 04:31:15.680 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:31:17.670 --> 04:31:17.680 align:start position:0%
we actually believe that this could
 
04:31:20.229 --> 04:31:20.239 align:start position:0%
promote hoarding when we look back at
 
04:31:20.239 --> 04:31:21.189 align:start position:0%
promote hoarding when we look back at
the

04:31:21.189 --> 04:31:21.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:31:23.189 --> 04:31:23.199 align:start position:0%
bradford golden retriever case that we
 
04:31:25.590 --> 04:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
saw in the last few years
 
04:31:28.469 --> 04:31:28.479 align:start position:0%
the woman had lost had let her license
 
04:31:30.469 --> 04:31:30.479 align:start position:0%
laps because she wasn't going over the
 
04:31:32.950 --> 04:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
limit at the time when she went to get
 
04:31:35.030 --> 04:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
her license reinstated
 
04:31:37.429 --> 04:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
her town wouldn't let her due to zoning
 
04:31:39.910 --> 04:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
and she was not able to transfer dogs
 
04:31:39.920 --> 04:31:41.269 align:start position:0%
and she was not able to transfer dogs
because

04:31:41.269 --> 04:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:31:43.510 --> 04:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
it would be illegal she would be due to
 
04:31:44.790 --> 04:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
pay the fines she could get a
 
04:31:46.950 --> 04:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor all of the things
 
04:31:49.189 --> 04:31:49.199 align:start position:0%
and so she opted not to transfer the
 
04:31:51.030 --> 04:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
puppies while she continued to try and
 
04:31:52.790 --> 04:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
get her town to
 
04:31:55.510 --> 04:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
allow her the ability to get a license
 
04:31:58.550 --> 04:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
this went on for upwards of a year those
 
04:32:00.870 --> 04:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
puppies got older they ended up breeding
 
04:32:03.030 --> 04:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
amongst each other and she had more
 
04:32:05.670 --> 04:32:05.680 align:start position:0%
puppies that she was unable to transfer
 
04:32:07.990 --> 04:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
this was to try and avoid breaking the
 
04:32:08.000 --> 04:32:08.950 align:start position:0%
this was to try and avoid breaking the
law

04:32:08.950 --> 04:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:32:11.189 --> 04:32:11.199 align:start position:0%
that's in place currently with the
 
04:32:13.750 --> 04:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
addition of higher fines i think we
 
04:32:16.469 --> 04:32:16.479 align:start position:0%
would see that as more likely of an
 
04:32:19.990 --> 04:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
issue we may see hoarding increase
 
04:32:22.389 --> 04:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
another concern here is the conflict of
 
04:32:25.349 --> 04:32:25.359 align:start position:0%
interest with the increased fines and
 
04:32:25.359 --> 04:32:26.309 align:start position:0%
interest with the increased fines and
the

04:32:26.309 --> 04:32:26.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:32:29.670 --> 04:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
contracted hearing officers
 
04:32:31.830 --> 04:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
in order for the hearing officers to be
 
04:32:31.840 --> 04:32:32.870 align:start position:0%
in order for the hearing officers to be
funded

04:32:32.870 --> 04:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
funded
 
04:32:35.030 --> 04:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
and for the department to be able to use
 
04:32:37.830 --> 04:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
them and pay out monies to them
 
04:32:39.830 --> 04:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
it would increase the likelihood that
 
04:32:41.990 --> 04:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
the fines that were imposed on people
 
04:32:44.630 --> 04:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
would be at the higher end to ensure
 
04:32:46.309 --> 04:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
that there would be monies in the
 
04:32:48.550 --> 04:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
revolving fund for these hearing
 
04:32:48.560 --> 04:32:54.229 align:start position:0%
revolving fund for these hearing
officers

04:32:54.229 --> 04:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:56.389 --> 04:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
talking about some solutions
 
04:32:58.229 --> 04:32:58.239 align:start position:0%
we know that law enforcement is
 
04:33:00.309 --> 04:33:00.319 align:start position:0%
responsible to prosecute pet vendors and
 
04:33:02.469 --> 04:33:02.479 align:start position:0%
they're not making it a priority it
 
04:33:03.910 --> 04:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
seems like the issue needs to be
 
04:33:05.910 --> 04:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
addressed with law enforcement why they
 
04:33:08.390 --> 04:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
aren't taking on this role that they
 
04:33:09.429 --> 04:33:09.439 align:start position:0%
should be
 
04:33:11.590 --> 04:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
if law enforcement wasn't interested in
 
04:33:13.830 --> 04:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
dealing with driver speeding would we
 
04:33:16.629 --> 04:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
just increase the price and fines for
 
04:33:19.590 --> 04:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
speeding to deter people from speeding
 
04:33:20.869 --> 04:33:20.879 align:start position:0%
most likely
 
04:33:22.310 --> 04:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't do that but that's what it
 
04:33:24.230 --> 04:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
feels like we're doing here rather than
 
04:33:27.109 --> 04:33:27.119 align:start position:0%
addressing the actual problem
 
04:33:30.070 --> 04:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
one thing that we came across is in the
 
04:33:32.869 --> 04:33:32.879 align:start position:0%
pawn broker and money lenders
 
04:33:36.629 --> 04:33:36.639 align:start position:0%
chapter 399 d they have the ability to
 
04:33:39.189 --> 04:33:39.199 align:start position:0%
issue a cease and desist and with that
 
04:33:41.830 --> 04:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
cease and desist the subject would be
 
04:33:43.670 --> 04:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
able to be fined up to ten thousand
 
04:33:46.789 --> 04:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
dollars or be imprisoned
 
04:33:48.869 --> 04:33:48.879 align:start position:0%
i think that that might actually be more
 
04:33:51.670 --> 04:33:51.680 align:start position:0%
of a deterrent than just saying for each
 
04:33:53.189 --> 04:33:53.199 align:start position:0%
puppy you sell we're going to increase
 
04:33:54.390 --> 04:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
the fines
 
04:33:56.869 --> 04:33:56.879 align:start position:0%
and have the department potentially want
 
04:33:59.269 --> 04:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
to go on the higher end of those fines
 
04:34:01.990 --> 04:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
to fund hearing officers
 
04:34:04.310 --> 04:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
so i would like to request that the bill
 
04:34:06.869 --> 04:34:06.879 align:start position:0%
be inexpedient to legislate or refer to
 
04:34:08.551 --> 04:34:08.561 align:start position:0%
interim study because i think there's a
 
04:34:10.949 --> 04:34:10.959 align:start position:0%
lot of questions that are still open i
 
04:34:12.629 --> 04:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
don't think that we're solving the issue
 
04:34:15.189 --> 04:34:15.199 align:start position:0%
at hand and if we could have the time to
 
04:34:16.470 --> 04:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
work together
 
04:34:18.230 --> 04:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
dog owners of the granite state has
 
04:34:20.470 --> 04:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
always offered to work on any of the
 
04:34:22.869 --> 04:34:22.879 align:start position:0%
bills that impact our community
 
04:34:24.310 --> 04:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
and we would really appreciate if the
 
04:34:26.070 --> 04:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner or any others would reach
 
04:34:28.150 --> 04:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
out to us to come up with a viable
 
04:34:30.070 --> 04:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
solution and i would be happy to take
 
04:34:32.390 --> 04:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
04:34:33.670 --> 04:34:33.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:34:36.230 --> 04:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
i i think in the interest of time we're
 
04:34:38.150 --> 04:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
going to hold off on questions right now
 
04:34:42.150 --> 04:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
and i think i will take the advice of my
 
04:34:44.709 --> 04:34:44.719 align:start position:0%
fine friend from sitting two seats down
 
04:34:46.709 --> 04:34:46.719 align:start position:0%
and and just we're going to recess this
 
04:34:47.990 --> 04:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
hearing and we're going to continue it
 
04:34:50.310 --> 04:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
to next tuesday at 2 p.m
 
04:34:53.189 --> 04:34:53.199 align:start position:0%
and we'll do that and if there's further
 
04:34:55.029 --> 04:34:55.039 align:start position:0%
uh important questions and in the
 
04:34:56.470 --> 04:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
interim we'll probably work on
 
04:34:59.029 --> 04:34:59.039 align:start position:0%
scheduling a work session as well
 
04:35:00.470 --> 04:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
potentially after that i'll check on the
 
04:35:02.230 --> 04:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
viability of that as well but for the
 
04:35:03.830 --> 04:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
benefit of the committee there's clearly
 
04:35:06.070 --> 04:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
more work that needs to be done here
 
04:35:08.150 --> 04:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
so we'll we'll recess this hearing until
 
04:35:10.230 --> 04:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
2 p.m next tuesday
 
04:35:11.670 --> 04:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:35:13.189 --> 04:35:13.199 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna go out on a limb and say we
 
04:35:14.551 --> 04:35:14.561 align:start position:0%
can have this room but i have to check
 
04:35:15.750 --> 04:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
and make sure on the scheduling but it
 
04:35:17.590 --> 04:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
will be here someplace we'll find a room
 
04:35:19.670 --> 04:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
but i believe it i'll work to get it
 
04:35:19.680 --> 04:35:20.789 align:start position:0%
but i believe it i'll work to get it
here

04:35:20.789 --> 04:35:20.799 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:35:22.709 --> 04:35:22.719 align:start position:0%
so we're going to do that and so that we
 
04:35:24.629 --> 04:35:24.639 align:start position:0%
can act on the
 
04:35:26.789 --> 04:35:26.799 align:start position:0%
exec the bills that we need to before 2
 
04:35:27.990 --> 04:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
pm today
 
04:35:30.390 --> 04:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
and then we have some early bills so so
 
04:35:31.910 --> 04:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
i'm going to recess this hearing now
 
04:35:37.830 --> 04:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:39.189 --> 04:35:39.199 align:start position:0%
the only thing i forgot to well i guess
 
04:35:40.150 --> 04:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
i don't need to read the blue sheet
 
04:35:44.551 --> 04:35:44.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:45.830 --> 04:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
okay i'm gonna
 
04:35:47.429 --> 04:35:47.439 align:start position:0%
give the clerk a minute to catch up
 
04:36:15.429 --> 04:36:15.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:15.439 --> 04:36:16.869 align:start position:0%
 
no

04:36:16.869 --> 04:36:16.879 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:36:43.910 --> 04:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:52.070 --> 04:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:26.310 --> 04:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:26.320 --> 04:37:33.189 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:37:33.189 --> 04:37:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:33.199 --> 04:37:34.629 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:37:34.629 --> 04:37:34.639 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:37:37.029 --> 04:37:37.039 align:start position:0%
so representatives
 
04:37:38.310 --> 04:37:38.320 align:start position:0%

the letter h of the bill as uh as it
 
04:38:36.869 --> 04:38:36.879 align:start position:0%
came over to us from the senate uh would
 
04:38:38.709 --> 04:38:38.719 align:start position:0%
have uh
 
04:38:41.029 --> 04:38:41.039 align:start position:0%
could be read as requiring the
 
04:38:44.070 --> 04:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
participation of a set of
 
04:38:44.080 --> 04:38:45.029 align:start position:0%
participation of a set of
uh

04:38:45.029 --> 04:38:45.039 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:38:48.150 --> 04:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
bodies that we don't have authority over
 
04:38:48.160 --> 04:38:49.189 align:start position:0%
bodies that we don't have authority over
um

04:38:49.189 --> 04:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:52.470 --> 04:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
and uh that uh the
 
04:38:55.990 --> 04:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
coordinator uh is the intent of this of
 
04:38:58.869 --> 04:38:58.879 align:start position:0%
this uh line was to
 
04:39:00.551 --> 04:39:00.561 align:start position:0%
have the coordinator
 
04:39:00.561 --> 04:39:02.070 align:start position:0%
have the coordinator
offer

04:39:02.070 --> 04:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
offer
 
04:39:04.869 --> 04:39:04.879 align:start position:0%
uh to have other agencies and
 
04:39:07.189 --> 04:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
municipalities universities general
 
04:39:08.709 --> 04:39:08.719 align:start position:0%
public et cetera
 
04:39:10.869 --> 04:39:10.879 align:start position:0%
participate so
 
04:39:10.879 --> 04:39:11.670 align:start position:0%
participate so
i

04:39:11.670 --> 04:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:39:13.750 --> 04:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
amended it to read invite the
 
04:39:16.230 --> 04:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
participation of
 
04:39:16.240 --> 04:39:17.109 align:start position:0%
participation of
and

04:39:17.109 --> 04:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:39:19.910 --> 04:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
then pretty much the same list of bodies
 
04:39:21.830 --> 04:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
that were that were in the
 
04:39:24.789 --> 04:39:24.799 align:start position:0%
bill as presented to us by the senate
 
04:39:27.029 --> 04:39:27.039 align:start position:0%
there was some question about whether it
 
04:39:28.869 --> 04:39:28.879 align:start position:0%
made sense to have
 
04:39:30.470 --> 04:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
environmental non-governmental
 
04:39:35.029 --> 04:39:35.039 align:start position:0%
organizations listed among those and
 
04:39:37.750 --> 04:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor suggested that it
 
04:39:39.030 --> 04:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:39:41.990 --> 04:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
cleaner if we did not have that because
 
04:39:44.070 --> 04:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
it would um
 
04:39:45.910 --> 04:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
taking it out would reduce the
 
04:39:49.270 --> 04:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
possibility of perceiving this is is as
 
04:39:52.070 --> 04:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
political anyway and i don't see a
 
04:39:53.830 --> 04:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
problem with that so
 
04:39:55.350 --> 04:39:55.360 align:start position:0%
i am
 
04:39:57.990 --> 04:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
moving this amendment that removes the
 
04:39:59.350 --> 04:39:59.360 align:start position:0%
reference to environmental
 
04:40:02.390 --> 04:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
non-governmental organizations and uh
 
04:40:04.070 --> 04:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
phrasing it as particip inviting
 
04:40:05.990 --> 04:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
participation rather than requiring
 
04:40:06.000 --> 04:40:07.750 align:start position:0%
participation rather than requiring
coordination

04:40:07.750 --> 04:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
coordination
 
04:40:10.150 --> 04:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
i i want to thank representative bixby
 
04:40:10.160 --> 04:40:11.750 align:start position:0%
i i want to thank representative bixby
for

04:40:11.750 --> 04:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:40:13.430 --> 04:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
taking into the concerns that were
 
04:40:15.510 --> 04:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
raised in providing a good clean
 
04:40:17.350 --> 04:40:17.360 align:start position:0%
amendment that should address all of the
 
04:40:19.350 --> 04:40:19.360 align:start position:0%
concerns is there any further discussion
 
04:40:23.350 --> 04:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:25.590 --> 04:40:25.600 align:start position:0%
regarding the amendments
 
04:40:27.270 --> 04:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
seeing none i'm going to ask the clerk
 
04:40:28.788 --> 04:40:28.798 align:start position:0%
to call the rule on the amendment this
 
04:40:31.510 --> 04:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
will be ought to pass are

04:47:23.190 --> 04:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
so if
 
04:47:23.200 --> 04:47:23.990 align:start position:0%
so if
the

04:47:23.990 --> 04:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:47:27.190 --> 04:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
if des uh is in the program is in a
 
04:47:29.350 --> 04:47:29.360 align:start position:0%
permitting process and they feel that
 
04:47:32.070 --> 04:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
they need an independent hydrogeologist
 
04:47:32.080 --> 04:47:33.030 align:start position:0%
they need an independent hydrogeologist
to

04:47:33.030 --> 04:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:47:35.030 --> 04:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh assess
 
04:47:37.590 --> 04:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
some aspect of the prod project they can
 
04:47:38.708 --> 04:47:38.718 align:start position:0%
hire that
 
04:47:40.708 --> 04:47:40.718 align:start position:0%
independent hydrogeologist and require
 
04:47:42.830 --> 04:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
the applicant to pay the pay for the
 
04:47:46.948 --> 04:47:46.958 align:start position:0%

okay that will close out the exact
 
04:48:50.150 --> 04:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
session for today
 
04:48:51.750 --> 04:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
and we have a
 
04:48:51.760 --> 04:48:53.190 align:start position:0%
and we have a
subcommittee

04:48:53.190 --> 04:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
04:48:57.350 --> 04:48:57.360 align:start position:0%

04:49:03.990 --> 04:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
367 367 thank you i was looking for it
 
04:49:06.868 --> 04:49:06.878 align:start position:0%
uh beginning at 2 pm and
 
04:49:09.110 --> 04:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
again well remind the committee that i
 
04:49:11.590 --> 04:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
will be reconvening next week i
 
04:49:13.670 --> 04:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
anticipate we'll probably schedule
 
04:49:17.110 --> 04:49:17.120 align:start position:0%
another work session at 1pm on 367 if
 
04:49:18.550 --> 04:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
it's necessary
 
04:49:20.390 --> 04:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
and that's why i moved the other hearing
 
04:49:23.190 --> 04:49:23.200 align:start position:0%
until 2 p.m so that's my anticipation
 
04:49:24.788 --> 04:49:24.798 align:start position:0%
but we'll we'll see what comes out of
 
04:49:26.310 --> 04:49:26.320 align:start position:0%
today's work session and what the needs
 
04:49:27.910 --> 04:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
are but i would ask the committee
 
04:49:30.390 --> 04:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
members to keep that open if if it's
 
04:49:30.400 --> 04:49:31.990 align:start position:0%
members to keep that open if if it's
necessary

04:49:31.990 --> 04:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
04:49:34.470 --> 04:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
thank you all and
 
04:49:36.310 --> 04:49:36.320 align:start position:0%

05:02:50.230 --> 05:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
seeing that the time is 201 i am going
 
05:02:51.670 --> 05:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
to open the
 
05:02:53.670 --> 05:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work session
 
05:02:57.590 --> 05:02:57.600 align:start position:0%
for senate bill 360 celib 367 relative
 
05:02:59.510 --> 05:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
to regulatory statuses of advanced
 
05:03:01.350 --> 05:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
recycling and manufacturing facilities
 
05:03:07.590 --> 05:03:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:08.868 --> 05:03:08.878 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:03:10.708 --> 05:03:10.718 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everyone
 
05:03:10.718 --> 05:03:11.910 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everyone
um

05:03:11.910 --> 05:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:14.708 --> 05:03:14.718 align:start position:0%
i just a brief reminder today that as we
 
05:03:16.390 --> 05:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
are proceeding and asking questions that
 
05:03:18.390 --> 05:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
we have that we make sure that we are
 
05:03:21.830 --> 05:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
being mindful of the process of
 
05:03:23.510 --> 05:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
as we're going back and forth between
 
05:03:25.350 --> 05:03:25.360 align:start position:0%
those who may be pros and cons it's a
 
05:03:27.430 --> 05:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
fairly informal process so for those of
 
05:03:29.910 --> 05:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
you coming before us please make sure
 
05:03:32.708 --> 05:03:32.718 align:start position:0%
you turn on your microphone and announce
 
05:03:34.708 --> 05:03:34.718 align:start position:0%
yourself and who you are with or where
 
05:03:37.590 --> 05:03:37.600 align:start position:0%
you are from so with that i will
 
05:03:38.708 --> 05:03:38.718 align:start position:0%
open the
 
05:03:40.470 --> 05:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
floor to any of the
 
05:03:41.910 --> 05:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work members who have
 
05:03:41.920 --> 05:03:46.310 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work members who have
questions

05:03:46.310 --> 05:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:49.510 --> 05:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:51.270 --> 05:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
i'll recognize representative contra
 
05:03:51.280 --> 05:03:52.230 align:start position:0%
i'll recognize representative contra
first

05:03:52.230 --> 05:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
first
 
05:03:54.230 --> 05:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
thank you and i'm not sure if anybody in
 
05:03:56.390 --> 05:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
the audience can answer this
 
05:03:59.590 --> 05:03:59.600 align:start position:0%
my question is regarding the energy that
 
05:04:01.350 --> 05:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
it would take to run a facility like
 
05:04:01.360 --> 05:04:16.628 align:start position:0%
it would take to run a facility like
this

05:04:16.628 --> 05:04:16.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:18.708 --> 05:04:18.718 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry it's it's this gentleman
 
05:04:18.718 --> 05:04:19.590 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry it's it's this gentleman
here

05:04:19.590 --> 05:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:04:26.550 --> 05:04:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:28.628 --> 05:04:28.638 align:start position:0%
i didn't see it i was apologizing i
 
05:04:32.868 --> 05:04:32.878 align:start position:0%
didn't see it a badge so
 
05:04:34.948 --> 05:04:34.958 align:start position:0%
on here good afternoon
 
05:04:37.350 --> 05:04:37.360 align:start position:0%

good just uh i'm craig cookson i'm the
 
05:04:42.070 --> 05:04:42.080 align:start position:0%
senior director of plastic
 
05:04:43.430 --> 05:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
sustainability with the american
 
05:04:46.948 --> 05:04:46.958 align:start position:0%
chemistry council in washington dc
 
05:04:49.510 --> 05:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
but happy to be here today get to the
 
05:04:51.110 --> 05:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
question a second i'm actually a native
 
05:04:52.550 --> 05:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
of keene new hampshire i grew up there
 
05:04:54.628 --> 05:04:54.638 align:start position:0%
i'm a keen high blackbird my father
 
05:04:56.070 --> 05:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
worked at a company called kingsbury
 
05:04:56.080 --> 05:04:57.430 align:start position:0%
worked at a company called kingsbury
corporation

05:04:57.430 --> 05:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
corporation
 
05:04:59.750 --> 05:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
for 27 years well-known employer in
 
05:05:01.990 --> 05:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
southwest new hampshire for over 100
 
05:05:02.000 --> 05:05:02.948 align:start position:0%
southwest new hampshire for over 100
years

05:05:02.948 --> 05:05:02.958 align:start position:0%
years
 
05:05:04.150 --> 05:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
and my mother worked at keene state
 
05:05:05.990 --> 05:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
college so it's great to be always great
 
05:05:08.868 --> 05:05:08.878 align:start position:0%
to be back in new hampshire so
 
05:05:10.550 --> 05:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
so as your question
 
05:05:12.070 --> 05:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
let me talk a little bit about the
 
05:05:14.948 --> 05:05:14.958 align:start position:0%
process so the most common technology
 
05:05:16.550 --> 05:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
used in advanced recycling is known as
 
05:05:19.270 --> 05:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
pyrolysis and pyrolysis is there's no
 
05:05:21.110 --> 05:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
oxygen in the process so there's no
 
05:05:23.110 --> 05:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
combustion so let me talk about what
 
05:05:25.190 --> 05:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
kind of happens so plastics that have
 
05:05:27.590 --> 05:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
been sorted from the solid waste stream
 
05:05:29.110 --> 05:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
you know they've been sorted segregated
 
05:05:31.190 --> 05:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
once twice maybe three times come into
 
05:05:33.350 --> 05:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
the facility
 
05:05:34.470 --> 05:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
05:05:36.310 --> 05:05:36.320 align:start position:0%
those plastics are usually shredded up
 
05:05:38.390 --> 05:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
and maybe melted so they provide sort of
 
05:05:41.910 --> 05:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
an even kind of flow into the system
 
05:05:43.830 --> 05:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
then they are put into the system and
 
05:05:46.390 --> 05:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
the system is heated using natural gas
 
05:05:46.400 --> 05:05:47.190 align:start position:0%
the system is heated using natural gas
um

05:05:47.190 --> 05:05:47.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:48.550 --> 05:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
just you know natural gas the same
 
05:05:50.230 --> 05:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
natural gas that would go into your home
 
05:05:52.070 --> 05:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
or to a business to provide you know
 
05:05:54.070 --> 05:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
some some heat
 
05:05:56.230 --> 05:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
and they're heated until they melt and
 
05:05:59.110 --> 05:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
they continue to be heated until they
 
05:06:01.510 --> 05:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
turn into gas vapors again there's no
 
05:06:03.430 --> 05:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
combustion right and you cool and
 
05:06:05.510 --> 05:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
condense those gas vapors back into
 
05:06:07.270 --> 05:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
what's called a liquid feedstock and
 
05:06:09.510 --> 05:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
that feedstock displaces
 
05:06:12.230 --> 05:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
natural gas or oil used in the
 
05:06:14.550 --> 05:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
production of new plastics and chemicals
 
05:06:16.390 --> 05:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
again so it keeps that oil in the ground
 
05:06:18.390 --> 05:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
keeps the plastics out of landfill
 
05:06:18.400 --> 05:06:19.510 align:start position:0%
keeps the plastics out of landfill
now

05:06:19.510 --> 05:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:06:21.190 --> 05:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
there is
 
05:06:22.948 --> 05:06:22.958 align:start position:0%
a hundred percent of the plastics do not
 
05:06:25.910 --> 05:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
become this liquid feedstock there's a
 
05:06:28.070 --> 05:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
byproduct called char char is kind of
 
05:06:31.030 --> 05:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
like an ash or basically it's carbon um
 
05:06:32.708 --> 05:06:32.718 align:start position:0%
in kind of a powdered form
 
05:06:34.788 --> 05:06:34.798 align:start position:0%
that can be they're looking at
 
05:06:36.628 --> 05:06:36.638 align:start position:0%
opportunities to use it as carbon black
 
05:06:38.628 --> 05:06:38.638 align:start position:0%
or an ink or you know tires things like
 
05:06:40.708 --> 05:06:40.718 align:start position:0%
that and then the other fraction is
 
05:06:42.310 --> 05:06:42.320 align:start position:0%
about 10 percent
 
05:06:44.150 --> 05:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
are non-condensable gases so think of
 
05:06:47.830 --> 05:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
propane uh that you you know
 
05:06:49.910 --> 05:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
have a backyard grill or a backyard
 
05:06:51.830 --> 05:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
barbecue with so they use those
 
05:06:54.310 --> 05:06:54.320 align:start position:0%
non-condensable gases as process energy
 
05:06:56.070 --> 05:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
for the system so that you don't need to
 
05:06:58.788 --> 05:06:58.798 align:start position:0%
use any sort of new virgin natural gas
 
05:07:00.788 --> 05:07:00.798 align:start position:0%
so once the system gets going it
 
05:07:03.110 --> 05:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
actually kind of powers itself now
 
05:07:04.550 --> 05:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of different life
 
05:07:06.470 --> 05:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
cycle analysis studies on this
 
05:07:08.788 --> 05:07:08.798 align:start position:0%
technology that looks at the energy use
 
05:07:10.230 --> 05:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
but that's basically the energy use
 
05:07:11.750 --> 05:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
right it's just to provide
 
05:07:15.430 --> 05:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
a heat source for the system but
 
05:07:17.590 --> 05:07:17.600 align:start position:0%
a range of life cycle studies done by
 
05:07:17.600 --> 05:07:18.868 align:start position:0%
a range of life cycle studies done by
basf

05:07:18.868 --> 05:07:18.878 align:start position:0%
basf
 
05:07:22.628 --> 05:07:22.638 align:start position:0%
excuse me honeywell eastman um agilex
 
05:07:24.708 --> 05:07:24.718 align:start position:0%
and others show that there is there are
 
05:07:27.190 --> 05:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
reductions of greenhouse gas emissions
 
05:07:29.750 --> 05:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
so there's lower energy use compared to
 
05:07:32.310 --> 05:07:32.320 align:start position:0%
sort of conventional way that we both
 
05:07:34.230 --> 05:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
manage our plastics which would be to
 
05:07:36.230 --> 05:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
you know incinerate them or to landfill
 
05:07:36.240 --> 05:07:37.030 align:start position:0%
you know incinerate them or to landfill
them

05:07:37.030 --> 05:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:07:39.430 --> 05:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
or uh or in at the same time also
 
05:07:41.510 --> 05:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
drilling for a new oil source right so
 
05:07:42.868 --> 05:07:42.878 align:start position:0%
you have to kind of account for both
 
05:07:44.948 --> 05:07:44.958 align:start position:0%
things the fact that one the plastics
 
05:07:46.390 --> 05:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
are not going to landfill and not going
 
05:07:48.390 --> 05:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
to incineration and number two you're
 
05:07:50.470 --> 05:07:50.480 align:start position:0%
not having to drill for that additional
 
05:07:53.990 --> 05:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
unit of oil so so yeah so this is a
 
05:07:55.830 --> 05:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
a process that's going to help us get to
 
05:08:00.550 --> 05:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:03.590 --> 05:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
so what you're saying uh and i was just
 
05:08:05.510 --> 05:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
wondering about the energy
 
05:08:08.230 --> 05:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
consumption at the plant more so than in
 
05:08:11.350 --> 05:08:11.360 align:start position:0%
the the process um how much
 
05:08:13.430 --> 05:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
well i guess if you're using natural gas
 
05:08:15.750 --> 05:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
gas throughout the entire plant um what
 
05:08:19.670 --> 05:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
are the btus that are being consumed
 
05:08:20.948 --> 05:08:20.958 align:start position:0%
i would have to
 
05:08:22.310 --> 05:08:22.320 align:start position:0%
get back to you on the exact amount of
 
05:08:24.150 --> 05:08:24.160 align:start position:0%
b2s it's going to depend on the size of
 
05:08:27.750 --> 05:08:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:30.470 --> 05:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh representative homala hi thank you so
 
05:08:32.868 --> 05:08:32.878 align:start position:0%
much i had a question um do you have a
 
05:08:35.910 --> 05:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
percentage of what amount of char
 
05:08:35.920 --> 05:08:37.590 align:start position:0%
percentage of what amount of char
is

05:08:37.590 --> 05:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:08:39.590 --> 05:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
produced in this process yeah so i would
 
05:08:41.670 --> 05:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
think of it almost like an 80 10 10 type
 
05:08:43.190 --> 05:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
of proposition you know give or take a
 
05:08:44.628 --> 05:08:44.638 align:start position:0%
few percentage points
 
05:08:48.310 --> 05:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
the 80 percent is the liquid
 
05:08:48.320 --> 05:08:49.350 align:start position:0%
the 80 percent is the liquid
uh

05:08:49.350 --> 05:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:08:51.750 --> 05:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
product that you know goes and becomes
 
05:08:53.430 --> 05:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
new plastics again
 
05:08:54.708 --> 05:08:54.718 align:start position:0%
and you know
 
05:08:55.910 --> 05:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
think about this way that's where these
 
05:08:57.670 --> 05:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
facilities make their money is by
 
05:08:59.110 --> 05:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
selling that product so they are
 
05:09:01.910 --> 05:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
uniquely incented to maximize every last
 
05:09:05.270 --> 05:09:05.280 align:start position:0%
molecule into the liquid feedstock about
 
05:09:07.350 --> 05:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
about 10 percent become you know stays
 
05:09:09.670 --> 05:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
as this non-condensable gas and used as
 
05:09:11.190 --> 05:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
again process
 
05:09:13.510 --> 05:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
energy for the system and then about 10
 
05:09:16.948 --> 05:09:16.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:18.628 --> 05:09:18.638 align:start position:0%
i'm going to recognize myself for a
 
05:09:21.030 --> 05:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
question if you don't mind um
 
05:09:22.550 --> 05:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
so when we're talking about the char
 
05:09:23.510 --> 05:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
that 10
 
05:09:23.520 --> 05:09:24.310 align:start position:0%
that 10
right

05:09:24.310 --> 05:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:09:24.320 --> 05:09:25.110 align:start position:0%
right
um

05:09:25.110 --> 05:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:27.830 --> 05:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
we also see similar sort of
 
05:09:29.910 --> 05:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
processes when we're talking about solid
 
05:09:31.190 --> 05:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
waste management i know a little bit
 
05:09:32.708 --> 05:09:32.718 align:start position:0%
about that so
 
05:09:35.110 --> 05:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
um oftentimes that
 
05:09:35.120 --> 05:09:35.990 align:start position:0%
um oftentimes that
that

05:09:35.990 --> 05:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:09:38.230 --> 05:09:38.240 align:start position:0%
method leaves a leachate cake or like
 
05:09:39.910 --> 05:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
some sort of non-disposable thing that
 
05:09:42.150 --> 05:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
then has to be disposed of elsewhere
 
05:09:44.230 --> 05:09:44.240 align:start position:0%
what is happening to that 10 of char
 
05:09:45.910 --> 05:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
what are you doing with it yeah that's a
 
05:09:48.390 --> 05:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
good question so right now that char can
 
05:09:51.110 --> 05:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
be safely landfilled again these
 
05:09:53.670 --> 05:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
facilities want to maximize
 
05:09:55.270 --> 05:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
every single thing they produce right
 
05:09:56.470 --> 05:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
both their products and any sort of
 
05:09:58.788 --> 05:09:58.798 align:start position:0%
byproducts or co-products so they are
 
05:10:01.510 --> 05:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
currently looking how that this
 
05:10:03.190 --> 05:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
char can be used in other products again
 
05:10:05.910 --> 05:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
like a carbon black um
 
05:10:08.550 --> 05:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
but to your question
 
05:10:11.110 --> 05:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
you know just as any manufacturer has
 
05:10:13.110 --> 05:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
kind of a byproduct and then that is
 
05:10:15.110 --> 05:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
governed by rikra
 
05:10:17.110 --> 05:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
and your you know state
 
05:10:17.120 --> 05:10:18.230 align:start position:0%
and your you know state
um

05:10:18.230 --> 05:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:19.910 --> 05:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
you know solid waste statute so any
 
05:10:22.310 --> 05:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
waste that's produced is governed under
 
05:10:23.830 --> 05:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
your solid waste statutes right they
 
05:10:25.910 --> 05:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
have to be in compliance so this is all
 
05:10:27.910 --> 05:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
fully regulated this is you know again
 
05:10:29.430 --> 05:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
has to be regulated under the resource
 
05:10:31.910 --> 05:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
conservation recovery act
 
05:10:35.990 --> 05:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:37.750 --> 05:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
05:10:39.830 --> 05:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
again for the question when it comes to
 
05:10:41.670 --> 05:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
the char that's going to be disposed of
 
05:10:43.110 --> 05:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
in the landfills
 
05:10:45.030 --> 05:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
um knowing that it is a plastic
 
05:10:45.040 --> 05:10:46.310 align:start position:0%
um knowing that it is a plastic
byproduct

05:10:46.310 --> 05:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
byproduct
 
05:10:46.320 --> 05:10:47.190 align:start position:0%
byproduct
uh

05:10:47.190 --> 05:10:47.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:10:51.030 --> 05:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
will it contain pfafs
 
05:10:53.590 --> 05:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
no it won't um so first of all
 
05:10:55.910 --> 05:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
the char is really just a carbon product
 
05:10:57.510 --> 05:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
number one um so it's almost like
 
05:10:59.670 --> 05:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
powdered carbon number two
 
05:11:02.470 --> 05:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
is the facilities this is i i i think
 
05:11:04.550 --> 05:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
where we have to um i think the most
 
05:11:06.470 --> 05:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
important point to mention here as we
 
05:11:07.990 --> 05:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
discuss these technologies really
 
05:11:08.000 --> 05:11:09.430 align:start position:0%
discuss these technologies really
separate

05:11:09.430 --> 05:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
separate
 
05:11:11.750 --> 05:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
what this what these technologies are
 
05:11:13.590 --> 05:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
from sort of your traditional solid
 
05:11:15.110 --> 05:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
waste right where solid waste is
 
05:11:18.708 --> 05:11:18.718 align:start position:0%
handling mixed garbage with no sort of
 
05:11:22.150 --> 05:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
incoming specification right and the
 
05:11:24.150 --> 05:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
facilities that get garbage are being
 
05:11:25.750 --> 05:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
paid to take it off people's hands
 
05:11:27.030 --> 05:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
because it has no value in the
 
05:11:27.040 --> 05:11:28.150 align:start position:0%
because it has no value in the
marketplace

05:11:28.150 --> 05:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
marketplace
 
05:11:30.310 --> 05:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
the big difference here is this is a
 
05:11:30.320 --> 05:11:31.510 align:start position:0%
the big difference here is this is a
very

05:11:31.510 --> 05:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
very
 
05:11:33.590 --> 05:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:11:36.070 --> 05:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
high-tech process so number one the
 
05:11:37.670 --> 05:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
facilities are going to be managing
 
05:11:40.628 --> 05:11:40.638 align:start position:0%
their inbound feedstock so they're going
 
05:11:41.510 --> 05:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
to be
 
05:11:43.110 --> 05:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
working with their suppliers of the
 
05:11:45.510 --> 05:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
plastics to make sure that they don't
 
05:11:47.430 --> 05:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
have contaminants or if they have any
 
05:11:49.830 --> 05:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
contaminants they're very very very very
 
05:11:52.070 --> 05:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
low right because they don't want to
 
05:11:54.070 --> 05:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
inherit somebody else's problem kind of
 
05:11:56.788 --> 05:11:56.798 align:start position:0%
like a bakery a bakery is if someone
 
05:11:59.110 --> 05:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
sends them a you know rotten eggs you
 
05:12:00.550 --> 05:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
don't want to make cupcakes and brownies
 
05:12:01.670 --> 05:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
out of those rotten eggs you're going to
 
05:12:03.190 --> 05:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
send them back to that farm that they
 
05:12:05.030 --> 05:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
came from right so the same thing here
 
05:12:06.150 --> 05:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
is they're going to be managing the
 
05:12:07.910 --> 05:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
plastics that are coming in because they
 
05:12:09.190 --> 05:12:09.200 align:start position:0%
just want the carbon and hydrogen
 
05:12:11.110 --> 05:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
molecules because that's what converts
 
05:12:12.788 --> 05:12:12.798 align:start position:0%
to a liquid so number one there's
 
05:12:15.350 --> 05:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
controls on the front end
 
05:12:17.990 --> 05:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me on the back end this liquid
 
05:12:21.030 --> 05:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
feedstock is replacing you know a sort
 
05:12:22.150 --> 05:12:22.160 align:start position:0%
of a
 
05:12:23.670 --> 05:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
a gas product you know natural gas
 
05:12:26.070 --> 05:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
product or an oil product in billion
 
05:12:28.868 --> 05:12:28.878 align:start position:0%
dollar um you know chemical and plastics
 
05:12:31.270 --> 05:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
manufacturing plants so
 
05:12:33.270 --> 05:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
they have to hit a very tight
 
05:12:36.070 --> 05:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
specification to be accepted at those
 
05:12:37.430 --> 05:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
facilities because you have billions of
 
05:12:40.868 --> 05:12:40.878 align:start position:0%
dollars of infrastructure you know
 
05:12:42.070 --> 05:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
in jeopardy they're not going to sort of
 
05:12:43.990 --> 05:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
put those in jeopardy by and introducing
 
05:12:46.150 --> 05:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
contaminants into the system so the
 
05:12:47.510 --> 05:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
point being is there's a lot of
 
05:12:49.110 --> 05:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
management on both ends right so you're
 
05:12:51.030 --> 05:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
really managing your inbound feed stock
 
05:12:52.550 --> 05:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
and you're managing the product that you
 
05:12:53.510 --> 05:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
produce because you have to hit
 
05:12:55.510 --> 05:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
specifications on both ends
 
05:12:57.670 --> 05:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
thank you um i'm going to recognize
 
05:13:01.430 --> 05:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
representative bixby um quickly um
 
05:13:03.190 --> 05:13:03.200 align:start position:0%
oh did you have a follow-up
 
05:13:05.190 --> 05:13:05.200 align:start position:0%
sorry representative let me let me get
 
05:13:07.190 --> 05:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
her follow-up first please
 
05:13:09.510 --> 05:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
sorry no worries thank you madam chair
 
05:13:11.510 --> 05:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
and just to follow up you mentioned
 
05:13:14.150 --> 05:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
suppliers of plastics
 
05:13:15.590 --> 05:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
because we're concerned with our
 
05:13:17.590 --> 05:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
landfills here in new hampshire
 
05:13:19.590 --> 05:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:13:21.990 --> 05:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
if this was to be something we looked at
 
05:13:23.670 --> 05:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
will the suppliers only be taking
 
05:13:25.270 --> 05:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
plastic that is
 
05:13:26.948 --> 05:13:26.958 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire or will they be
 
05:13:28.550 --> 05:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
bringing in plastic from outside the
 
05:13:28.560 --> 05:13:29.750 align:start position:0%
bringing in plastic from outside the
state

05:13:29.750 --> 05:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:13:32.868 --> 05:13:32.878 align:start position:0%
they could uh it depends right um i mean
 
05:13:35.030 --> 05:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
i think we've included a provision in
 
05:13:38.390 --> 05:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
the bill that they look first to new
 
05:13:40.390 --> 05:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire suppliers of plastics and
 
05:13:41.750 --> 05:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
again that could be commercial
 
05:13:44.310 --> 05:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
businesses um i think a you know your
 
05:13:45.830 --> 05:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
super stop and shop or your hannaford
 
05:13:47.590 --> 05:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
brothers down the street they produce a
 
05:13:50.310 --> 05:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
lot of plastic film and wrap
 
05:13:51.990 --> 05:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
that's actually a really good material
 
05:13:53.350 --> 05:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
for this a lot of that film actually
 
05:13:54.868 --> 05:13:54.878 align:start position:0%
goes all the way on a truck all the way
 
05:13:57.350 --> 05:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
down to uh virginia where it gets turned
 
05:13:59.590 --> 05:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
into decking for treks but those markets
 
05:14:01.830 --> 05:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
are not insatiable right so there's
 
05:14:03.350 --> 05:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
opportunities for that type of material
 
05:14:05.670 --> 05:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
then there's also the plastics in the
 
05:14:07.190 --> 05:14:07.200 align:start position:0%
home that we don't recycle now we do a
 
05:14:08.628 --> 05:14:08.638 align:start position:0%
good job of recycling our plastic
 
05:14:11.830 --> 05:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
bottles our milk jugs our you know pets
 
05:14:13.670 --> 05:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
soda and water bottles our detergent
 
05:14:15.750 --> 05:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
bottles but think everything else our
 
05:14:19.030 --> 05:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
frozen pea bag our deli containers our
 
05:14:20.788 --> 05:14:20.798 align:start position:0%
coffee lids things like that those are
 
05:14:22.708 --> 05:14:22.718 align:start position:0%
the types of plastics that these
 
05:14:24.868 --> 05:14:24.878 align:start position:0%
facilities would be so they would work
 
05:14:27.510 --> 05:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
with a variety of suppliers of plastics
 
05:14:29.030 --> 05:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
i think is your question but there's
 
05:14:30.868 --> 05:14:30.878 align:start position:0%
nothing in this bill that precludes them
 
05:14:32.868 --> 05:14:32.878 align:start position:0%
from taking um
 
05:14:34.868 --> 05:14:34.878 align:start position:0%
out of state plastics however we did put
 
05:14:37.990 --> 05:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
in the bill uh a some language around
 
05:14:39.990 --> 05:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
preference for in-state plastics because
 
05:14:41.830 --> 05:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
you're right you do want to sort of
 
05:14:43.510 --> 05:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
make sure that new hampshire residents
 
05:14:46.830 --> 05:14:46.840 align:start position:0%
can recycle more and greater types of
 
05:14:49.750 --> 05:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
plastics you representative bixby though
 
05:14:51.030 --> 05:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
he is not a member of the subcommittee
 
05:14:52.070 --> 05:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
he's a member of environment and
 
05:14:55.110 --> 05:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
agriculture and therefore go ahead
 
05:14:56.550 --> 05:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
so um
 
05:15:00.628 --> 05:15:00.638 align:start position:0%
a little bit more in terms of uh the
 
05:15:02.628 --> 05:15:02.638 align:start position:0%
sort of the process from feedstock
 
05:15:05.990 --> 05:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
through separation so um
 
05:15:06.000 --> 05:15:07.670 align:start position:0%
through separation so um
plastics

05:15:07.670 --> 05:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
plastics
 
05:15:10.150 --> 05:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
don't just contain polymers they also
 
05:15:11.830 --> 05:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
contain a number of additives that are
 
05:15:16.470 --> 05:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
used as plasticizers as colorants as um
 
05:15:17.910 --> 05:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:15:17.920 --> 05:15:18.868 align:start position:0%
you know
way

05:15:18.868 --> 05:15:18.878 align:start position:0%
way
 
05:15:18.878 --> 05:15:20.948 align:start position:0%
way
anti-static

05:15:20.948 --> 05:15:20.958 align:start position:0%
anti-static
 
05:15:24.628 --> 05:15:24.638 align:start position:0%
films um num uh biocides
 
05:15:27.350 --> 05:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
uh depending on the use of the plastic
 
05:15:27.360 --> 05:15:28.470 align:start position:0%
uh depending on the use of the plastic
and

05:15:28.470 --> 05:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:15:32.708 --> 05:15:32.718 align:start position:0%
uh those additives contain a range of
 
05:15:34.550 --> 05:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
metals and
 
05:15:37.750 --> 05:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
halides such as chlorine fluorine
 
05:15:37.760 --> 05:15:39.750 align:start position:0%
halides such as chlorine fluorine
bromine

05:15:39.750 --> 05:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
bromine
 
05:15:42.070 --> 05:15:42.080 align:start position:0%
what is the fate of
 
05:15:42.080 --> 05:15:43.708 align:start position:0%
what is the fate of
the

05:15:43.708 --> 05:15:43.718 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:15:43.718 --> 05:15:45.350 align:start position:0%
the
non-hydrocarbon

05:15:45.350 --> 05:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
non-hydrocarbon
 
05:15:47.510 --> 05:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh elements that are in the plastic that
 
05:15:50.550 --> 05:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
goes in that's in the feed stock sure
 
05:15:51.990 --> 05:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
i think
 
05:15:53.830 --> 05:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
um it's a good question and i think the
 
05:15:55.270 --> 05:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
first point i want to just kind of
 
05:15:58.070 --> 05:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
reiterate the point is that uh the
 
05:15:59.910 --> 05:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
companies are uniquely incentive to sort
 
05:16:01.750 --> 05:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
of try to keep
 
05:16:03.510 --> 05:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
you know anything that isn't plastic
 
05:16:05.590 --> 05:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
right out however you're right there are
 
05:16:07.590 --> 05:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
certain you know additives and things in
 
05:16:10.708 --> 05:16:10.718 align:start position:0%
plastics um and so a lot of the
 
05:16:13.110 --> 05:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
technologies do have processes in place
 
05:16:16.310 --> 05:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
in the system where they can uh so both
 
05:16:17.830 --> 05:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
sort of purify
 
05:16:20.310 --> 05:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
the oil that they have um as well as
 
05:16:23.270 --> 05:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
purify the gases um specific too i gotta
 
05:16:25.190 --> 05:16:25.200 align:start position:0%
be careful here because you know certain
 
05:16:26.470 --> 05:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
the technologies all have kind of
 
05:16:28.470 --> 05:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
proprietary processes because being able
 
05:16:31.270 --> 05:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
to hit the specification that the
 
05:16:33.830 --> 05:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
plastic manufacturer wants is you know a
 
05:16:36.150 --> 05:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
important business differentiator but a
 
05:16:37.990 --> 05:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
lot of the companies will use like
 
05:16:38.000 --> 05:16:39.430 align:start position:0%
lot of the companies will use like
sodium

05:16:39.430 --> 05:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
sodium
 
05:16:42.310 --> 05:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
to bind to any sort of fugitive chlorine
 
05:16:44.230 --> 05:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
or fluorine that makes it in the system
 
05:16:45.830 --> 05:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
and folks who know their chemistry
 
05:16:48.310 --> 05:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
sodium chloride is assault right so
 
05:16:50.868 --> 05:16:50.878 align:start position:0%
that's one technique that is used to
 
05:16:53.430 --> 05:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
sort of remove any of these
 
05:16:55.510 --> 05:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
types of things like halogenated types
 
05:16:55.520 --> 05:16:56.390 align:start position:0%
types of things like halogenated types
of

05:16:56.390 --> 05:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:16:56.400 --> 05:17:00.550 align:start position:0%
of
compounds

05:17:00.550 --> 05:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:00.560 --> 05:17:01.270 align:start position:0%
 
and

05:17:01.270 --> 05:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:17:03.190 --> 05:17:03.200 align:start position:0%
and then there's also
 
05:17:05.670 --> 05:17:05.680 align:start position:0%
there's also a very
 
05:17:09.110 --> 05:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
sophisticated scrubbers on the back end
 
05:17:10.310 --> 05:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
that sort of pull any sort of these
 
05:17:13.350 --> 05:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:13.360 --> 05:17:15.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:17:15.110 --> 05:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:17:17.110 --> 05:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
yeah so um
 
05:17:18.310 --> 05:17:18.320 align:start position:0%
so do the
 
05:17:20.868 --> 05:17:20.878 align:start position:0%
do the halides end up in the liquid
 
05:17:24.070 --> 05:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
fraction and then get extracted that
 
05:17:26.788 --> 05:17:26.798 align:start position:0%
that point with the uh with the sodium
 
05:17:28.310 --> 05:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
or do they
 
05:17:28.320 --> 05:17:29.910 align:start position:0%
or do they
um

05:17:29.910 --> 05:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:31.750 --> 05:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
or or do they
 
05:17:34.150 --> 05:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
or is that extraction done in the
 
05:17:38.070 --> 05:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
pyrolysis chamber at the 300 to 600
 
05:17:41.110 --> 05:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
degrees celsius
 
05:17:42.948 --> 05:17:42.958 align:start position:0%
it's it's normally
 
05:17:45.270 --> 05:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
done during the pyrolysis process right
 
05:17:47.510 --> 05:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
so you sort of form the salts there to
 
05:17:49.990 --> 05:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
take those out a lot of these facilities
 
05:17:51.590 --> 05:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
you know i i'll give you a sort of a
 
05:17:51.600 --> 05:17:52.628 align:start position:0%
you know i i'll give you a sort of a
quote

05:17:52.628 --> 05:17:52.638 align:start position:0%
quote
 
05:17:55.190 --> 05:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
excuse me sorry a little uh frog my
 
05:17:56.550 --> 05:17:56.560 align:start position:0%
throat but
 
05:17:59.590 --> 05:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
we have one member that is taking um
 
05:18:02.150 --> 05:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
a sort of a product a feedstock product
 
05:18:05.110 --> 05:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
from a supplier and their catalyst which
 
05:18:08.150 --> 05:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
is a 50 million dollar catalyst
 
05:18:11.030 --> 05:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
insured up to 50 million i should say
 
05:18:13.430 --> 05:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
to continue to get that insurance they
 
05:18:14.948 --> 05:18:14.958 align:start position:0%
have to ensure that anything they put
 
05:18:18.470 --> 05:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
into their system has less than 10 parts
 
05:18:20.868 --> 05:18:20.878 align:start position:0%
per billion of chlorine
 
05:18:22.788 --> 05:18:22.798 align:start position:0%
so this is a system where these
 
05:18:24.550 --> 05:18:24.560 align:start position:0%
companies are uniquely
 
05:18:26.470 --> 05:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh set up to have to
 
05:18:28.628 --> 05:18:28.638 align:start position:0%
do sort of the purification steps and
 
05:18:31.350 --> 05:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
anything to avoid um
 
05:18:32.948 --> 05:18:32.958 align:start position:0%
you know things downstream where the
 
05:18:35.110 --> 05:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
ultimate customer will not take them so
 
05:18:36.948 --> 05:18:36.958 align:start position:0%
again there's kind of several controls
 
05:18:38.868 --> 05:18:38.878 align:start position:0%
here one is prevent it from coming in
 
05:18:40.708 --> 05:18:40.718 align:start position:0%
the door in the first place so they're
 
05:18:41.990 --> 05:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
gonna know where their feed stock is
 
05:18:44.628 --> 05:18:44.638 align:start position:0%
coming from if it's coming in with
 
05:18:46.948 --> 05:18:46.958 align:start position:0%
you know levels of chlorine that are
 
05:18:48.310 --> 05:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
high they're going to send it back and
 
05:18:49.590 --> 05:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
say we're not doing business with you
 
05:18:49.600 --> 05:18:50.788 align:start position:0%
say we're not doing business with you
anymore

05:18:50.788 --> 05:18:50.798 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
05:18:52.788 --> 05:18:52.798 align:start position:0%
it's possible to keep 100 of everything
 
05:18:54.708 --> 05:18:54.718 align:start position:0%
out so that's where the systems come in
 
05:18:56.948 --> 05:18:56.958 align:start position:0%
place with with the scrubbers and making
 
05:18:58.868 --> 05:18:58.878 align:start position:0%
sure that they you know sodium and other
 
05:19:02.070 --> 05:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
um types of systems to
 
05:19:06.230 --> 05:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:08.470 --> 05:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
so would this mean that
 
05:19:10.868 --> 05:19:10.878 align:start position:0%
they would not be able to accept
 
05:19:13.590 --> 05:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
polyvinyl chloride pipe as a as
 
05:19:15.350 --> 05:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
feedstock for
 
05:19:15.360 --> 05:19:16.150 align:start position:0%
feedstock for
uh

05:19:16.150 --> 05:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:19:18.628 --> 05:19:18.638 align:start position:0%
for this process and
 
05:19:21.030 --> 05:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
given and sort of as an analogy
 
05:19:22.948 --> 05:19:22.958 align:start position:0%
analogous to that question
 
05:19:25.430 --> 05:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh is there an entire range of plastics
 
05:19:27.510 --> 05:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
that are just not susceptible to being
 
05:19:27.520 --> 05:19:28.708 align:start position:0%
that are just not susceptible to being
processed

05:19:28.708 --> 05:19:28.718 align:start position:0%
processed
 
05:19:30.310 --> 05:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
in this way
 
05:19:32.868 --> 05:19:32.878 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a good question
 
05:19:32.878 --> 05:19:33.670 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a good question
so

05:19:33.670 --> 05:19:33.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:19:37.910 --> 05:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:39.750 --> 05:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
types of technologies the technologies
 
05:19:42.550 --> 05:19:42.560 align:start position:0%
listed in this bill like pyrolysis
 
05:19:44.708 --> 05:19:44.718 align:start position:0%
for instance
 
05:19:47.030 --> 05:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
are going to be taking mostly
 
05:19:49.350 --> 05:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
polyethylene polypropylene and
 
05:19:51.350 --> 05:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
polystyrene because that's what's going
 
05:19:55.270 --> 05:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:57.990 --> 05:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
technologies like methanolisis or
 
05:20:00.708 --> 05:20:00.718 align:start position:0%
gasification can take plastics like this
 
05:20:01.990 --> 05:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
p-e-t water bottle because there's
 
05:20:04.070 --> 05:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
actually oxygen atoms in here and they
 
05:20:05.910 --> 05:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
do a little bit of a different process
 
05:20:08.150 --> 05:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
and form different types of
 
05:20:12.150 --> 05:20:12.160 align:start position:0%
molecules and and precursor chemicals um
 
05:20:14.230 --> 05:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
once they're done but uh
 
05:20:16.070 --> 05:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
but so i would say if you're running a
 
05:20:19.190 --> 05:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
pyrolysis unit i can actually say this
 
05:20:21.190 --> 05:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
is that they are
 
05:20:23.910 --> 05:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
very much likely not to be taking pvc
 
05:20:23.920 --> 05:20:24.150 align:start position:0%
very much likely not to be taking pvc
pipe

05:20:24.150 --> 05:20:24.160 align:start position:0%
pipe
 
05:20:24.160 --> 05:20:28.150 align:start position:0%
pipe
[Music]

05:20:28.150 --> 05:20:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:30.310 --> 05:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
thank you i'd like to also ask a
 
05:20:31.910 --> 05:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
continuing democrat a couple more
 
05:20:33.350 --> 05:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
questions around the condensation
 
05:20:34.628 --> 05:20:34.638 align:start position:0%
process because we're talking about an
 
05:20:36.390 --> 05:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
anoxic environment you mentioned that
 
05:20:40.390 --> 05:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
then there is some sort of condensation
 
05:20:42.548 --> 05:20:42.558 align:start position:0%
in that
 
05:20:44.230 --> 05:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
are there other sorts of chemicals that
 
05:20:47.030 --> 05:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
are trapped inside the condensate what's
 
05:20:49.750 --> 05:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
going on inside that leftover water is
 
05:20:51.030 --> 05:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
it being
 
05:20:52.788 --> 05:20:52.798 align:start position:0%
off-gassed is it
 
05:20:54.390 --> 05:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
leaving some other way are you
 
05:20:56.150 --> 05:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
collecting it and then disposing of it
 
05:21:03.350 --> 05:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:18.070 --> 05:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:19.830 --> 05:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
and so my question is are there
 
05:21:21.990 --> 05:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
contaminants stuck inside of that water
 
05:21:23.670 --> 05:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
is that water being collected is it
 
05:21:25.590 --> 05:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
going somewhere
 
05:21:27.190 --> 05:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
water could be used as a sort of a
 
05:21:30.070 --> 05:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
coolant right to sort of take the um the
 
05:21:31.510 --> 05:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
gas vapors
 
05:21:33.350 --> 05:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
back down to a liquid
 
05:21:36.470 --> 05:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
but the technologies are really going to
 
05:21:38.948 --> 05:21:38.958 align:start position:0%
try to avoid number one especially in a
 
05:21:41.510 --> 05:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
pyrolysis system you're likely not to
 
05:21:44.948 --> 05:21:44.958 align:start position:0%
have very many oxygen molecules
 
05:21:46.628 --> 05:21:46.638 align:start position:0%
number two
 
05:21:48.788 --> 05:21:48.798 align:start position:0%
the hydrogen molecules are the most
 
05:21:50.788 --> 05:21:50.798 align:start position:0%
valuable thing that you can have right
 
05:21:52.628 --> 05:21:52.638 align:start position:0%
as member was describing the system as
 
05:21:55.590 --> 05:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
an 80 20 or 80 10 10 system you're kind
 
05:21:57.590 --> 05:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
of left over with carbon right and
 
05:21:57.600 --> 05:21:58.390 align:start position:0%
of left over with carbon right and
that's

05:21:58.390 --> 05:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
that's
 
05:22:00.150 --> 05:22:00.160 align:start position:0%
in in the char and that's because
 
05:22:01.750 --> 05:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
there's not enough hydrogen molecules to
 
05:22:04.470 --> 05:22:04.480 align:start position:0%
it attached to so if you're producing
 
05:22:04.480 --> 05:22:05.510 align:start position:0%
it attached to so if you're producing
water

05:22:05.510 --> 05:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
water
 
05:22:06.948 --> 05:22:06.958 align:start position:0%
that's a problem with your efficiency
 
05:22:08.310 --> 05:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
because you're losing as we all know
 
05:22:10.310 --> 05:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
from you know basic chemistry h2o you're
 
05:22:13.030 --> 05:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
losing two hydrogens so and there's
 
05:22:15.990 --> 05:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
oxygen in the system so in a pyrolysis
 
05:22:17.830 --> 05:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
system they're not going to produce
 
05:22:17.840 --> 05:22:19.750 align:start position:0%
system they're not going to produce
water

05:22:19.750 --> 05:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
water
 
05:22:21.990 --> 05:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
thank you additionally one of the other
 
05:22:24.788 --> 05:22:24.798 align:start position:0%
things that i had wanted to kind of talk
 
05:22:26.868 --> 05:22:26.878 align:start position:0%
about was that you had testified that
 
05:22:26.878 --> 05:22:28.150 align:start position:0%
about was that you had testified that
there

05:22:28.150 --> 05:22:28.160 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:22:29.510 --> 05:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
there would be no chance that there
 
05:22:32.548 --> 05:22:32.558 align:start position:0%
would be any sort of contamination pfas
 
05:22:35.190 --> 05:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
left over in the liquid version
 
05:22:38.628 --> 05:22:38.638 align:start position:0%
of this material and so i guess what i'm
 
05:22:39.750 --> 05:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
asking is
 
05:22:41.590 --> 05:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
then we had uh representative bixby
 
05:22:42.788 --> 05:22:42.798 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
05:22:44.948 --> 05:22:44.958 align:start position:0%
metals non-ferrous and ferrous metals
 
05:22:48.070 --> 05:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
are you testing the feedstock coming in
 
05:22:49.910 --> 05:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
how is that source sorting is there like
 
05:22:51.270 --> 05:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
a bill of lading that says yes this
 
05:22:52.390 --> 05:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
stuff has been
 
05:22:54.628 --> 05:22:54.638 align:start position:0%
inspected like what's going on there
 
05:22:56.628 --> 05:22:56.638 align:start position:0%
so a lot of testing is going on right so
 
05:22:58.230 --> 05:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
number one they're going to be testing
 
05:22:58.240 --> 05:22:59.110 align:start position:0%
number one they're going to be testing
the

05:22:59.110 --> 05:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:22:59.120 --> 05:23:00.150 align:start position:0%
the
um

05:23:00.150 --> 05:23:00.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:01.990 --> 05:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
the inbound feed stock right to make
 
05:23:03.510 --> 05:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
sure that it's hitting the specification
 
05:23:05.110 --> 05:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
that they need to be able to produce a
 
05:23:09.030 --> 05:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
good sort of oil product number two
 
05:23:10.868 --> 05:23:10.878 align:start position:0%
the oil product is going to be tested
 
05:23:13.270 --> 05:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
and tested a lot by the companies that
 
05:23:15.510 --> 05:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
are then taking that and using it as an
 
05:23:15.520 --> 05:23:16.628 align:start position:0%
are then taking that and using it as an
alternative

05:23:16.628 --> 05:23:16.638 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
05:23:16.638 --> 05:23:18.230 align:start position:0%
alternative
material

05:23:18.230 --> 05:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
material
 
05:23:20.070 --> 05:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire des would come out and
 
05:23:22.070 --> 05:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
do stack testing i was out at a company
 
05:23:24.230 --> 05:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
called altera
 
05:23:27.430 --> 05:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
energy out in uh akron ohio several
 
05:23:29.270 --> 05:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
weeks ago you can it's right there on
 
05:23:31.110 --> 05:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
linkedin and twitter and while we were
 
05:23:33.110 --> 05:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
there the ohio epa was doing stack
 
05:23:34.788 --> 05:23:34.798 align:start position:0%
testing that day so there will be
 
05:23:37.030 --> 05:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
testing of that additionally
 
05:23:39.430 --> 05:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
under you know rickra rules the char
 
05:23:40.788 --> 05:23:40.798 align:start position:0%
would be tested to make sure that
 
05:23:42.708 --> 05:23:42.718 align:start position:0%
there's no hazardous constituents in
 
05:23:43.830 --> 05:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
that char
 
05:23:46.310 --> 05:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of testing going on
 
05:23:48.230 --> 05:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
both from the government regulation
 
05:23:48.240 --> 05:23:49.430 align:start position:0%
both from the government regulation
standpoint

05:23:49.430 --> 05:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
05:23:50.948 --> 05:23:50.958 align:start position:0%
as well as
 
05:23:52.230 --> 05:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
you know sort of how you're running sort
 
05:23:54.470 --> 05:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
of the most optimal business here which
 
05:23:54.480 --> 05:23:55.270 align:start position:0%
of the most optimal business here which
is

05:23:55.270 --> 05:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:23:56.948 --> 05:23:56.958 align:start position:0%
make sure you have a good sort of
 
05:23:58.548 --> 05:23:58.558 align:start position:0%
product coming in the door
 
05:24:00.868 --> 05:24:00.878 align:start position:0%
and also that the product that are that
 
05:24:02.470 --> 05:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
you're having a good sort of feed of
 
05:24:04.548 --> 05:24:04.558 align:start position:0%
plastics coming in the door as well as
 
05:24:06.390 --> 05:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
making sure that the product you are
 
05:24:08.070 --> 05:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
sending out to the customer is going to
 
05:24:11.910 --> 05:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:14.150 --> 05:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
representative homeowner
 
05:24:15.590 --> 05:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you i just wondered could you give
 
05:24:18.070 --> 05:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
us some examples of some states who are
 
05:24:20.070 --> 05:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
further down the line and are
 
05:24:21.750 --> 05:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
functioning with some of these advanced
 
05:24:21.760 --> 05:24:25.990 align:start position:0%
functioning with some of these advanced
recycling

05:24:25.990 --> 05:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:27.590 --> 05:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
ohio is a great example wonderful
 
05:24:29.270 --> 05:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
company there called
 
05:24:29.280 --> 05:24:30.948 align:start position:0%
company there called
altera

05:24:30.948 --> 05:24:30.958 align:start position:0%
altera
 
05:24:33.670 --> 05:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
they are they have a
 
05:24:35.510 --> 05:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
investment from a company called neste
 
05:24:38.070 --> 05:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
neste is a big finish company
 
05:24:39.830 --> 05:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
that is really moving towards more
 
05:24:41.750 --> 05:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
circular types of products they do a lot
 
05:24:42.948 --> 05:24:42.958 align:start position:0%
they actually just had an announcement
 
05:24:44.390 --> 05:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
with mcdonald's
 
05:24:47.270 --> 05:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
mcdonald's is piloting some uh cups down
 
05:24:48.948 --> 05:24:48.958 align:start position:0%
in the savannah georgia area that are
 
05:24:51.830 --> 05:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
made from both biogenic content as well
 
05:24:56.230 --> 05:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
as content made from advanced recycling
 
05:24:58.230 --> 05:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
so that's ohio ohio is one of the states
 
05:24:59.590 --> 05:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
that have passed legislation very
 
05:25:01.670 --> 05:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
similar to this
 
05:25:03.430 --> 05:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
georgia is another great example this
 
05:25:06.470 --> 05:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
company called nexus nexus is right now
 
05:25:09.350 --> 05:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
taking plastics um as is altera the
 
05:25:10.548 --> 05:25:10.558 align:start position:0%
plastics are coming in the door they're
 
05:25:12.390 --> 05:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
turning it into this liquid feedstock
 
05:25:15.750 --> 05:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
they send that feedstock to both shell
 
05:25:17.190 --> 05:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
a chemical plant that they have in
 
05:25:20.310 --> 05:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
louisiana as well as chevron phillips
 
05:25:22.868 --> 05:25:22.878 align:start position:0%
based in in the texas area
 
05:25:25.030 --> 05:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
nexus also has
 
05:25:26.310 --> 05:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
some really good
 
05:25:27.910 --> 05:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
investment partners
 
05:25:29.910 --> 05:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
georgia is a state that passed this
 
05:25:31.830 --> 05:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
legislation as well texas not
 
05:25:34.310 --> 05:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
surprisingly is kind of a really
 
05:25:36.070 --> 05:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
interesting state in that of course a
 
05:25:37.670 --> 05:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
lot of the off take or the plastics
 
05:25:39.910 --> 05:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
producers are there they passed very
 
05:25:41.830 --> 05:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
similar legislation a couple years ago
 
05:25:44.628 --> 05:25:44.638 align:start position:0%
companies like honeywell have
 
05:25:46.548 --> 05:25:46.558 align:start position:0%
announced facilities there a company out
 
05:25:48.868 --> 05:25:48.878 align:start position:0%
of uh the uk called plastic energy that
 
05:25:51.110 --> 05:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
has two working facilities in spain
 
05:25:53.030 --> 05:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
right now and we can get more into
 
05:25:54.390 --> 05:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
plastic energy because they are the the
 
05:25:55.910 --> 05:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
starting point for
 
05:25:57.830 --> 05:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
recycled plastics that are in magnum
 
05:26:00.230 --> 05:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
unilever ice cream tubs and mondelez
 
05:26:01.750 --> 05:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
philadelphia cream cheese tubs are doing
 
05:26:03.750 --> 05:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
some really fabulous things so texas is
 
05:26:03.760 --> 05:26:04.788 align:start position:0%
some really fabulous things so texas is
another

05:26:04.788 --> 05:26:04.798 align:start position:0%
another
 
05:26:07.510 --> 05:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
success story um there is brave and
 
05:26:10.628 --> 05:26:10.638 align:start position:0%
environmental in zebulun north carolina
 
05:26:12.548 --> 05:26:12.558 align:start position:0%
they actually moved down
 
05:26:14.310 --> 05:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
to north carolina from new york they
 
05:26:16.150 --> 05:26:16.160 align:start position:0%
were kind of birthed in yonkers new york
 
05:26:17.590 --> 05:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
but the regulatory environment a little
 
05:26:19.750 --> 05:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
tough tougher there um but they're doing
 
05:26:21.350 --> 05:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
some really exciting things they also
 
05:26:23.430 --> 05:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
have off take with chevron phillips
 
05:26:25.190 --> 05:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
chevron phillips by the way
 
05:26:26.788 --> 05:26:26.798 align:start position:0%
important to say this as i've mentioned
 
05:26:28.868 --> 05:26:28.878 align:start position:0%
them a few times they have a commitment
 
05:26:31.990 --> 05:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
that by 2030 to produce one billion
 
05:26:32.000 --> 05:26:33.110 align:start position:0%
that by 2030 to produce one billion
pounds

05:26:33.110 --> 05:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
pounds
 
05:26:35.270 --> 05:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
of what they're calling their marlek's
 
05:26:37.590 --> 05:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
circular polymers so those are polymers
 
05:26:40.788 --> 05:26:40.798 align:start position:0%
that are made from recycled plastics not
 
05:26:43.830 --> 05:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
from you know virgin oil or natural gas
 
05:26:46.548 --> 05:26:46.558 align:start position:0%
so this is happening um eastman is
 
05:26:48.310 --> 05:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
another fabulous company they're based
 
05:26:50.310 --> 05:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
in kingsport tennessee tennessee has
 
05:26:52.230 --> 05:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
also passed very similar to legislation
 
05:26:53.430 --> 05:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
they have two technologies they have a
 
05:26:55.430 --> 05:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
gasification technology that enables
 
05:26:57.350 --> 05:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
them to take things like carpet which is
 
05:26:59.110 --> 05:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
very difficult to recycle they also have
 
05:27:01.270 --> 05:27:01.280 align:start position:0%
a methanolisis technology
 
05:27:02.868 --> 05:27:02.878 align:start position:0%
they are working with warby parker
 
05:27:04.868 --> 05:27:04.878 align:start position:0%
anybody have warby parker glasses here
 
05:27:08.230 --> 05:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
um warby parker is uh
 
05:27:09.990 --> 05:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
is you know using it's a you know a
 
05:27:12.230 --> 05:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
different type of plastic and they are
 
05:27:15.190 --> 05:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
you know recycling their glasses through
 
05:27:17.430 --> 05:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
um eastman system and also working then
 
05:27:19.990 --> 05:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
get recycled content into their glasses
 
05:27:23.190 --> 05:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
through this system eastman also has a
 
05:27:24.788 --> 05:27:24.798 align:start position:0%
partnership with
 
05:27:27.750 --> 05:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
procter gamble and so the herbal essence
 
05:27:29.270 --> 05:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
kind of five different types of their
 
05:27:31.430 --> 05:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
conditioner and shampoo bottles are
 
05:27:33.110 --> 05:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
going to be made with recycled plastics
 
05:27:34.310 --> 05:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
thanks to
 
05:27:35.750 --> 05:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
advanced recycling
 
05:27:37.110 --> 05:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
and i think my favorite example is
 
05:27:39.110 --> 05:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
wendy's the wendy's announced and this
 
05:27:40.628 --> 05:27:40.638 align:start position:0%
is all you know
 
05:27:42.070 --> 05:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
it's all on google we can provide all
 
05:27:44.390 --> 05:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
these examples um you know following the
 
05:27:46.230 --> 05:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
testimony wendy's announced several
 
05:27:48.070 --> 05:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
months ago that they're moving from a
 
05:27:50.708 --> 05:27:50.718 align:start position:0%
lined paper cup which was not recyclable
 
05:27:54.230 --> 05:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
to a fully plastic cup made with 20
 
05:27:56.230 --> 05:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
recycled plastics and again this is in
 
05:27:57.830 --> 05:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
one thing i haven't said is all this is
 
05:27:59.270 --> 05:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
certified by the international
 
05:28:01.270 --> 05:28:01.280 align:start position:0%
sustainability and carbon certification
 
05:28:03.670 --> 05:28:03.680 align:start position:0%
program iscc plus which means that
 
05:28:05.110 --> 05:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
somebody goes to each step of the
 
05:28:06.948 --> 05:28:06.958 align:start position:0%
process and says okay you got plastics
 
05:28:10.310 --> 05:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
in okay you produce this liquid okay you
 
05:28:12.310 --> 05:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
um sent this liquid to
 
05:28:14.628 --> 05:28:14.638 align:start position:0%
uh you know chevron phillips or shell or
 
05:28:16.628 --> 05:28:16.638 align:start position:0%
whoever and then they produced a plastic
 
05:28:18.470 --> 05:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
and then that plastic went to you know
 
05:28:20.788 --> 05:28:20.798 align:start position:0%
the in this case it's berry plastics
 
05:28:23.270 --> 05:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
that makes uh the cup for wendy's so
 
05:28:24.788 --> 05:28:24.798 align:start position:0%
yeah there's a lot of success stories
 
05:28:26.390 --> 05:28:26.400 align:start position:0%
out there and again this is gonna i
 
05:28:27.910 --> 05:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
think the most important thing is number
 
05:28:27.920 --> 05:28:29.350 align:start position:0%
think the most important thing is number
one

05:28:29.350 --> 05:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:28:32.708 --> 05:28:32.718 align:start position:0%
it's gonna enable us to recycle more
 
05:28:34.628 --> 05:28:34.638 align:start position:0%
amounts and greater types of plastics
 
05:28:36.310 --> 05:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
than we recycle now we really only
 
05:28:38.788 --> 05:28:38.798 align:start position:0%
recycle our bottles very well
 
05:28:40.788 --> 05:28:40.798 align:start position:0%
and it's also going to enable us to get
 
05:28:44.470 --> 05:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
more recycled plastics into our um into
 
05:28:46.230 --> 05:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
our packaging again because it's very
 
05:28:47.910 --> 05:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
difficult to get mechanically recycled
 
05:28:49.750 --> 05:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
plastics into food pharmaceutical and
 
05:28:53.830 --> 05:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:55.430 --> 05:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
do you find that in the places that are
 
05:28:57.830 --> 05:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
doing this that they're having to sort
 
05:29:01.110 --> 05:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
of change their consumer habits about
 
05:29:03.190 --> 05:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
what goes into the recycling bins if
 
05:29:05.110 --> 05:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
you're saying you know you've got water
 
05:29:06.788 --> 05:29:06.798 align:start position:0%
bottles but other things
 
05:29:08.390 --> 05:29:08.400 align:start position:0%
you know frozen
 
05:29:10.788 --> 05:29:10.798 align:start position:0%
frozen food bags whatever does that is
 
05:29:12.708 --> 05:29:12.718 align:start position:0%
that changing what does that look like
 
05:29:14.390 --> 05:29:14.400 align:start position:0%
is the ripple effect yeah that's a good
 
05:29:17.350 --> 05:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
question is that's kind of the the the
 
05:29:20.390 --> 05:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
likely sort of demand pull you know um
 
05:29:22.948 --> 05:29:22.958 align:start position:0%
as these facilities get more established
 
05:29:25.110 --> 05:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
and grow and pull more plastics into the
 
05:29:25.120 --> 05:29:26.070 align:start position:0%
and grow and pull more plastics into the
system

05:29:26.070 --> 05:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
system
 
05:29:27.830 --> 05:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the next evolutionary
 
05:29:29.910 --> 05:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
step is where people be able to put more
 
05:29:32.628 --> 05:29:32.638 align:start position:0%
types of plastics i think a good example
 
05:29:34.788 --> 05:29:34.798 align:start position:0%
of this in action
 
05:29:37.030 --> 05:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
is the city of houston announced a you
 
05:29:38.390 --> 05:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
know america's fourth largest city
 
05:29:40.390 --> 05:29:40.400 align:start position:0%
houston announced a partnership with two
 
05:29:42.070 --> 05:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
two of our companies lion delbasel and
 
05:29:45.350 --> 05:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
exxon mobil they announced a um
 
05:29:45.360 --> 05:29:46.310 align:start position:0%
exxon mobil they announced a um
a

05:29:46.310 --> 05:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:29:48.708 --> 05:29:48.718 align:start position:0%
a partnership with a
 
05:29:50.470 --> 05:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
a waste hauler
 
05:29:52.788 --> 05:29:52.798 align:start position:0%
called i think it's fcc and then also a
 
05:29:54.868 --> 05:29:54.878 align:start position:0%
company called cyclix and what cyclix
 
05:29:57.270 --> 05:29:57.280 align:start position:0%
does is prepare this feedstock by
 
05:29:58.948 --> 05:29:58.958 align:start position:0%
aggregating the plastic and then
 
05:30:01.430 --> 05:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
producing a feedstock that can be used
 
05:30:04.150 --> 05:30:04.160 align:start position:0%
and so the nation's fourth largest city
 
05:30:06.470 --> 05:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
is really working to draw more plastics
 
05:30:08.230 --> 05:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
into the system so like your frozen pea
 
05:30:11.350 --> 05:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
bag and your your coffee lid your pouch
 
05:30:13.670 --> 05:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
of granola or beef jerky this stuff that
 
05:30:14.948 --> 05:30:14.958 align:start position:0%
right now we're not putting in our
 
05:30:17.030 --> 05:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
recycling bin so it's kind of exciting
 
05:30:20.070 --> 05:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
so the key is to get the demand in place
 
05:30:21.910 --> 05:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
first right because no one's going to
 
05:30:21.920 --> 05:30:22.868 align:start position:0%
first right because no one's going to
sort

05:30:22.868 --> 05:30:22.878 align:start position:0%
sort
 
05:30:24.310 --> 05:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
plastics that they don't have a market
 
05:30:26.548 --> 05:30:26.558 align:start position:0%
to sell to until there's that market to
 
05:30:28.310 --> 05:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
sell to and then that's going to pull
 
05:30:29.910 --> 05:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
along these plastics that right now
 
05:30:32.708 --> 05:30:32.718 align:start position:0%
we're not putting in the bin
 
05:30:34.150 --> 05:30:34.160 align:start position:0%
one more
 
05:30:36.390 --> 05:30:36.400 align:start position:0%
and and i'm not this is a very basic
 
05:30:37.910 --> 05:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
question and i don't know the answer so
 
05:30:39.590 --> 05:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
i'm just gonna ask it
 
05:30:41.750 --> 05:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
on the financial side of that
 
05:30:43.590 --> 05:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
are people
 
05:30:45.110 --> 05:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
paying that
 
05:30:47.670 --> 05:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
advanced recycling facility money to
 
05:30:49.670 --> 05:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
take their product or is that facility
 
05:30:52.868 --> 05:30:52.878 align:start position:0%
paying them to take their product back
 
05:30:54.548 --> 05:30:54.558 align:start position:0%
that's a great question because it's a
 
05:30:56.708 --> 05:30:56.718 align:start position:0%
fundamental difference between
 
05:30:59.990 --> 05:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturing and waste disposal right
 
05:31:01.430 --> 05:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
waste disposal
 
05:31:04.070 --> 05:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
you have something that is garbage and
 
05:31:06.708 --> 05:31:06.718 align:start position:0%
it's worth nothing and so people you
 
05:31:08.230 --> 05:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
have to pay somebody to take it off your
 
05:31:10.070 --> 05:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
hands because you can't do anything with
 
05:31:14.230 --> 05:31:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:14.240 --> 05:31:15.510 align:start position:0%
 
whereas

05:31:15.510 --> 05:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
whereas
 
05:31:17.910 --> 05:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
this process they pay for the plastics
 
05:31:20.390 --> 05:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
because it's a commodity that has value
 
05:31:23.510 --> 05:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
and so that value then it you know and
 
05:31:25.030 --> 05:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
really the value starts all the way at
 
05:31:28.310 --> 05:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
the end over 400 companies um globally
 
05:31:29.910 --> 05:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
have committed big brand companies have
 
05:31:32.628 --> 05:31:32.638 align:start position:0%
committed to having up to 30 recycled
 
05:31:34.230 --> 05:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
content or recycled plastics in their
 
05:31:34.240 --> 05:31:35.670 align:start position:0%
content or recycled plastics in their
packaging

05:31:35.670 --> 05:31:35.680 align:start position:0%
packaging
 
05:31:37.270 --> 05:31:37.280 align:start position:0%
they're putting pressure on their
 
05:31:39.430 --> 05:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
converters you know like the berry
 
05:31:41.590 --> 05:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
plastics who makes the drink cup for
 
05:31:43.270 --> 05:31:43.280 align:start position:0%
wendy's to provide them with those
 
05:31:45.110 --> 05:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
plastics barry in turn is looking
 
05:31:47.590 --> 05:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
upstream and saying to their suppliers i
 
05:31:50.070 --> 05:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
need recycled plastics from you because
 
05:31:52.788 --> 05:31:52.798 align:start position:0%
my customers are pushing me to get this
 
05:31:55.990 --> 05:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
so those 400 companies um are really
 
05:31:59.110 --> 05:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
providing a lot of demand pull right now
 
05:32:01.510 --> 05:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of value plastic prices
 
05:32:04.628 --> 05:32:04.638 align:start position:0%
um as well just for your your water uh
 
05:32:06.628 --> 05:32:06.638 align:start position:0%
bottles right now and your um things
 
05:32:08.628 --> 05:32:08.638 align:start position:0%
like milk jugs and detergent balls are
 
05:32:10.310 --> 05:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
at like really high prices now too
 
05:32:12.150 --> 05:32:12.160 align:start position:0%
there's a huge there's a lot of demand
 
05:32:15.190 --> 05:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
for um for you know this type of stuff
 
05:32:15.200 --> 05:32:15.990 align:start position:0%
for um for you know this type of stuff
yep

05:32:15.990 --> 05:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
yep
 
05:32:18.070 --> 05:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative contra and
 
05:32:20.868 --> 05:32:20.878 align:start position:0%
then i will go to representative kaplan
 
05:32:22.868 --> 05:32:22.878 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair and thank you
 
05:32:25.830 --> 05:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
again for taking a question um i have
 
05:32:25.840 --> 05:32:26.708 align:start position:0%
again for taking a question um i have
two

05:32:26.708 --> 05:32:26.718 align:start position:0%
two
 
05:32:28.310 --> 05:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
one has to do with the recyclable
 
05:32:30.150 --> 05:32:30.160 align:start position:0%
products once
 
05:32:32.150 --> 05:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
those say the wendy's recyclable cups
 
05:32:34.150 --> 05:32:34.160 align:start position:0%
get into the system are they able to
 
05:32:35.990 --> 05:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
come back into the facility to be
 
05:32:38.868 --> 05:32:38.878 align:start position:0%
recycled again yes absolutely
 
05:32:40.310 --> 05:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
that's that's one of the exciting things
 
05:32:43.430 --> 05:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
about this is the lined paper cup
 
05:32:45.990 --> 05:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
is a challenge to recycle but a fully
 
05:32:47.190 --> 05:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
plastic cup that's going to be a
 
05:32:49.750 --> 05:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
polypropylene cup which is very similar
 
05:32:52.230 --> 05:32:52.240 align:start position:0%
to a deli container or you know big
 
05:32:54.150 --> 05:32:54.160 align:start position:0%
yogurt container that can be recycled
 
05:32:54.160 --> 05:32:55.750 align:start position:0%
yogurt container that can be recycled
yes

05:32:55.750 --> 05:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:32:59.110 --> 05:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
and my other question was
 
05:33:00.948 --> 05:33:00.958 align:start position:0%
one thing that you said that kind of
 
05:33:03.910 --> 05:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
raised a flag for me and um
 
05:33:06.150 --> 05:33:06.160 align:start position:0%
right now there is really nothing in the
 
05:33:07.990 --> 05:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
northeast area of any of these
 
05:33:08.000 --> 05:33:09.270 align:start position:0%
northeast area of any of these
facilities

05:33:09.270 --> 05:33:09.280 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
05:33:11.670 --> 05:33:11.680 align:start position:0%
but you made a mention that you moved
 
05:33:11.680 --> 05:33:12.788 align:start position:0%
but you made a mention that you moved
braven

05:33:12.788 --> 05:33:12.798 align:start position:0%
braven
 
05:33:16.150 --> 05:33:16.160 align:start position:0%
move from new york to north carolina due
 
05:33:18.310 --> 05:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
to the regulatory environment
 
05:33:20.070 --> 05:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
so my question to you is is are you
 
05:33:21.830 --> 05:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
looking at new hampshire because of our
 
05:33:25.670 --> 05:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:27.270 --> 05:33:27.280 align:start position:0%
we are here
 
05:33:28.628 --> 05:33:28.638 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
05:33:31.350 --> 05:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
a you know a sort of
 
05:33:33.510 --> 05:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
a system that will sort of support these
 
05:33:35.030 --> 05:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
facilities right there's a real
 
05:33:37.590 --> 05:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity in the northeast for this
 
05:33:40.230 --> 05:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
technology um you know i would say the
 
05:33:41.910 --> 05:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
closest facility there's just been an
 
05:33:43.430 --> 05:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
announcement for a facility in
 
05:33:45.910 --> 05:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
pennsylvania um
 
05:33:47.670 --> 05:33:47.680 align:start position:0%
you know ohio is probably or north
 
05:33:49.590 --> 05:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
carolina the closest sort of working
 
05:33:49.600 --> 05:33:50.948 align:start position:0%
carolina the closest sort of working
facilities

05:33:50.948 --> 05:33:50.958 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
05:33:52.948 --> 05:33:52.958 align:start position:0%
so this is an opportunity to in new
 
05:33:54.868 --> 05:33:54.878 align:start position:0%
hampshire to allow the residents here to
 
05:33:57.510 --> 05:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
recycle more types and greater amounts
 
05:33:59.190 --> 05:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
of the plastics
 
05:34:01.910 --> 05:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
but to do so the challenge is is when
 
05:34:03.910 --> 05:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
these facilities i mean a lot of these
 
05:34:06.150 --> 05:34:06.160 align:start position:0%
technologies or companies are more early
 
05:34:06.160 --> 05:34:07.510 align:start position:0%
technologies or companies are more early
commercial

05:34:07.510 --> 05:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
commercial
 
05:34:08.708 --> 05:34:08.718 align:start position:0%
and it takes from the day of the
 
05:34:10.390 --> 05:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
announcement it might take up to three
 
05:34:12.628 --> 05:34:12.638 align:start position:0%
years to build a facility
 
05:34:14.948 --> 05:34:14.958 align:start position:0%
and so the challenge is if they go in
 
05:34:17.590 --> 05:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
and they're classified wrongly as solid
 
05:34:17.600 --> 05:34:18.470 align:start position:0%
and they're classified wrongly as solid
waste

05:34:18.470 --> 05:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
waste
 
05:34:20.390 --> 05:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a number one kind of
 
05:34:22.868 --> 05:34:22.878 align:start position:0%
time consuming to sort of talk about
 
05:34:24.470 --> 05:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
okay this is what we're doing and six to
 
05:34:25.830 --> 05:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
nine months later
 
05:34:27.270 --> 05:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
the solid waste folks are going to say
 
05:34:28.708 --> 05:34:28.718 align:start position:0%
okay whoops you know you should be down
 
05:34:29.830 --> 05:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
the hall
 
05:34:31.830 --> 05:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
getting the air permit and your your
 
05:34:33.750 --> 05:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
water permit and other things from from
 
05:34:35.990 --> 05:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
the manufacturing office
 
05:34:38.548 --> 05:34:38.558 align:start position:0%
that's number one so because when you
 
05:34:39.590 --> 05:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
when you
 
05:34:41.110 --> 05:34:41.120 align:start position:0%
are looking to cite a facility it's kind
 
05:34:43.590 --> 05:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
of four key things is one you gotta you
 
05:34:46.390 --> 05:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
gotta find um a site right so you gotta
 
05:34:47.990 --> 05:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
work within the local community i think
 
05:34:49.590 --> 05:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
that's very important is sort of is
 
05:34:51.030 --> 05:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
working with the local community just
 
05:34:52.708 --> 05:34:52.718 align:start position:0%
because you might pass this law in new
 
05:34:54.548 --> 05:34:54.558 align:start position:0%
hampshire doesn't sort of negate the
 
05:34:56.628 --> 05:34:56.638 align:start position:0%
fact that companies are gonna going to
 
05:34:57.750 --> 05:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
work with
 
05:34:59.430 --> 05:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
local officials to find suitable
 
05:35:01.190 --> 05:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
locations so that's number one right
 
05:35:02.470 --> 05:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
number two
 
05:35:04.548 --> 05:35:04.558 align:start position:0%
is they have to line up their feed stock
 
05:35:07.030 --> 05:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
agreements okay who's got the plastics
 
05:35:08.948 --> 05:35:08.958 align:start position:0%
and can they get the plastics to us in
 
05:35:10.868 --> 05:35:10.878 align:start position:0%
the specification that we need it right
 
05:35:13.110 --> 05:35:13.120 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be taking the pvc
 
05:35:14.948 --> 05:35:14.958 align:start position:0%
pipe likely right so they have to line
 
05:35:16.868 --> 05:35:16.878 align:start position:0%
that up number three they have to line
 
05:35:19.270 --> 05:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
up their offtake partner so once we
 
05:35:21.350 --> 05:35:21.360 align:start position:0%
produce our liquid who are we gonna sell
 
05:35:23.430 --> 05:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
that to you know and what is their
 
05:35:25.750 --> 05:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
specification and then number four
 
05:35:27.750 --> 05:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
there's lining up investors or loans or
 
05:35:30.310 --> 05:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
whatever to finance the facility so
 
05:35:32.708 --> 05:35:32.718 align:start position:0%
having a transparent
 
05:35:35.830 --> 05:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
um predictable regulatory system of the
 
05:35:38.470 --> 05:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
types of permits that they need is very
 
05:35:40.390 --> 05:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
important and we can get into it more
 
05:35:42.390 --> 05:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
but regulating these facilities as
 
05:35:44.548 --> 05:35:44.558 align:start position:0%
manufacturing also better protects the
 
05:35:46.070 --> 05:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
public health because you're regulating
 
05:35:47.350 --> 05:35:47.360 align:start position:0%
the things that these facilities
 
05:35:48.948 --> 05:35:48.958 align:start position:0%
actually do
 
05:35:50.548 --> 05:35:50.558 align:start position:0%
one more and then just so that we're
 
05:35:54.070 --> 05:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
clear i i will go to re rep um
 
05:35:55.990 --> 05:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
okay oh thank you and then i'd like to
 
05:35:58.150 --> 05:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
actually ask a few questions from folks
 
05:36:00.070 --> 05:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely
 
05:36:01.030 --> 05:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
05:36:03.430 --> 05:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
i mean you gave a nice answer but the
 
05:36:06.150 --> 05:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
question was
 
05:36:07.990 --> 05:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
the regulatory environment in new
 
05:36:10.548 --> 05:36:10.558 align:start position:0%
hampshire versus the surrounding states
 
05:36:13.110 --> 05:36:13.120 align:start position:0%
is it is it why it's more attractive uh
 
05:36:15.350 --> 05:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
to put try and push this legislation
 
05:36:17.350 --> 05:36:17.360 align:start position:0%
through new hampshire
 
05:36:17.360 --> 05:36:19.030 align:start position:0%
through new hampshire
our

05:36:19.030 --> 05:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
our
 
05:36:20.230 --> 05:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
i would say
 
05:36:21.670 --> 05:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
to answer that i would say we are
 
05:36:23.430 --> 05:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
looking at there are other
 
05:36:25.510 --> 05:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
bills in states right now so new york is
 
05:36:27.590 --> 05:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
considering this legislation
 
05:36:29.910 --> 05:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
they've had hearings on it rhode island
 
05:36:31.270 --> 05:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
is considering this legislation
 
05:36:33.190 --> 05:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
connecticut had a hearing on this
 
05:36:35.750 --> 05:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
legislation so this is a legislation
 
05:36:37.990 --> 05:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
that policy makers from across the
 
05:36:39.590 --> 05:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
country there's 18 states that have
 
05:36:41.590 --> 05:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
passed similar legislation and more
 
05:36:43.910 --> 05:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
states that are considering it right now
 
05:36:45.670 --> 05:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
including new hampshire uh michigan
 
05:36:47.750 --> 05:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
there's actually a hearing on this today
 
05:36:50.628 --> 05:36:50.638 align:start position:0%
so i would
 
05:36:51.910 --> 05:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to think of how you want me
 
05:36:53.750 --> 05:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
to answer this but the point being is
 
05:36:56.948 --> 05:36:56.958 align:start position:0%
that this is something that um
 
05:36:59.990 --> 05:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
is you know if you want to attract sort
 
05:37:01.830 --> 05:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
of new business this types of business
 
05:37:03.350 --> 05:37:03.360 align:start position:0%
this type of business that can help sort
 
05:37:06.708 --> 05:37:06.718 align:start position:0%
of reduce your landfill or plastics go
 
05:37:09.670 --> 05:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
into landfill and um in
 
05:37:11.990 --> 05:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
waste energy plants
 
05:37:13.910 --> 05:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
this is legislation is important because
 
05:37:15.190 --> 05:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
it sort of
 
05:37:17.430 --> 05:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
enables a predictable transparent
 
05:37:20.708 --> 05:37:20.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:22.150 --> 05:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:37:24.788 --> 05:37:24.798 align:start position:0%
i'm going to pause for a moment and i
 
05:37:27.270 --> 05:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
have a few questions for the director
 
05:37:29.990 --> 05:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
both director wimsat and i apologize to
 
05:37:31.670 --> 05:37:31.680 align:start position:0%

yes if you two wouldn't mind answering
 
05:37:37.750 --> 05:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
some questions around some of this line
 
05:37:40.548 --> 05:37:40.558 align:start position:0%
of questioning i would wonder if you
 
05:37:43.030 --> 05:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
would speak to them
 
05:37:43.040 --> 05:37:44.310 align:start position:0%

yes so if you could yes thank you yeah
 
05:38:05.350 --> 05:38:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:05.360 --> 05:38:09.830 align:start position:0%
 
absolutely

05:38:09.830 --> 05:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:11.430 --> 05:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
and feel yeah if there's a third chair
 
05:38:17.350 --> 05:38:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:20.390 --> 05:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services
 
05:38:24.150 --> 05:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
and then an additional air quality so
 
05:38:25.990 --> 05:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
my name is mike fitzgerald i am the
 
05:38:28.230 --> 05:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
assistant director of the air resources
 
05:38:29.990 --> 05:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
division we are part of the department
 
05:38:32.310 --> 05:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
of environmental services uh we're in a
 
05:38:34.070 --> 05:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
separate division from the waste
 
05:38:34.080 --> 05:38:35.270 align:start position:0%
separate division from the waste
division

05:38:35.270 --> 05:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
division
 
05:38:37.190 --> 05:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
and also as i mentioned with me is todd
 
05:38:39.270 --> 05:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
moore todd is one of our senior
 
05:38:41.670 --> 05:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
permitting managers uh within the air
 
05:38:41.680 --> 05:38:47.190 align:start position:0%
permitting managers uh within the air
division

05:38:47.190 --> 05:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:48.830 --> 05:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
um directors
 
05:38:51.350 --> 05:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
uh so some of the things that we had
 
05:38:53.910 --> 05:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
heard both today around one question i
 
05:38:56.470 --> 05:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
did have was around this 10 percent of
 
05:38:59.670 --> 05:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
the char that is sort of left over
 
05:39:01.510 --> 05:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
and it is it was testified just
 
05:39:03.190 --> 05:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
previously that it would then go into
 
05:39:04.948 --> 05:39:04.958 align:start position:0%
the landfill do you know if that
 
05:39:06.948 --> 05:39:06.958 align:start position:0%
potential char would be considered
 
05:39:08.868 --> 05:39:08.878 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste would it be disposed of
 
05:39:10.868 --> 05:39:10.878 align:start position:0%
in a separate area of a landfill what
 
05:39:12.868 --> 05:39:12.878 align:start position:0%
does that look like to you to the best
 
05:39:15.430 --> 05:39:15.440 align:start position:0%
of your knowledge sure i i have to
 
05:39:17.350 --> 05:39:17.360 align:start position:0%
preface again mike wimsat director of
 
05:39:19.830 --> 05:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
the waste division for new hampshire des
 
05:39:21.590 --> 05:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
i preface my remarks by saying it's
 
05:39:24.230 --> 05:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
going to be very specific to
 
05:39:26.310 --> 05:39:26.320 align:start position:0%
the particular process and i will also
 
05:39:27.910 --> 05:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
tell you we don't have much experience
 
05:39:29.590 --> 05:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
really with these advanced recycling
 
05:39:31.510 --> 05:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
facilities so what i'm going to
 
05:39:33.830 --> 05:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
tell you comes from my broad experience
 
05:39:35.190 --> 05:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
in dealing with solid and hazardous
 
05:39:37.430 --> 05:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
waste but not based on any specific
 
05:39:39.030 --> 05:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
knowledge of an advanced recycling
 
05:39:41.270 --> 05:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
activity but generally speaking any
 
05:39:42.948 --> 05:39:42.958 align:start position:0%
waste that's going to go to a solid
 
05:39:44.868 --> 05:39:44.878 align:start position:0%
waste facility particularly from a
 
05:39:46.548 --> 05:39:46.558 align:start position:0%
manufacturing facility
 
05:39:48.548 --> 05:39:48.558 align:start position:0%
um has there's a requirement under state
 
05:39:50.868 --> 05:39:50.878 align:start position:0%
law to do what's called a waste
 
05:39:52.868 --> 05:39:52.878 align:start position:0%
determination so you're required to
 
05:39:55.110 --> 05:39:55.120 align:start position:0%
understand what went into generating
 
05:39:56.628 --> 05:39:56.638 align:start position:0%
your waste
 
05:39:58.390 --> 05:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
evaluate that
 
05:40:00.788 --> 05:40:00.798 align:start position:0%
if that indicates any appropriate need
 
05:40:02.868 --> 05:40:02.878 align:start position:0%
for testing to ensure that there are you
 
05:40:04.548 --> 05:40:04.558 align:start position:0%
know it to determine whether there are
 
05:40:06.548 --> 05:40:06.558 align:start position:0%
any hazardous constituents
 
05:40:08.230 --> 05:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
in concentrations that would render
 
05:40:09.670 --> 05:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
something a hazardous waste or
 
05:40:11.830 --> 05:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
characteristics then you're required to
 
05:40:13.590 --> 05:40:13.600 align:start position:0%
do that and that's pretty routinely done
 
05:40:15.270 --> 05:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
the landfills have
 
05:40:17.030 --> 05:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
staff who are dedicated to working with
 
05:40:18.708 --> 05:40:18.718 align:start position:0%
their commercial customers to make those
 
05:40:18.718 --> 05:40:20.230 align:start position:0%
their commercial customers to make those
determinations

05:40:20.230 --> 05:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
determinations
 
05:40:22.390 --> 05:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
so um the expectation is that that would
 
05:40:24.070 --> 05:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
be evaluated if it were a hazardous
 
05:40:25.590 --> 05:40:25.600 align:start position:0%
waste it would not be accepted for
 
05:40:27.830 --> 05:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
disposal at a solid waste facility and
 
05:40:29.590 --> 05:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
would have to go off for shipping
 
05:40:31.190 --> 05:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
specifically to a hazardous waste
 
05:40:32.868 --> 05:40:32.878 align:start position:0%
facility that was permitted
 
05:40:34.548 --> 05:40:34.558 align:start position:0%
if it were
 
05:40:36.310 --> 05:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
eligible it was if it was classified as
 
05:40:38.470 --> 05:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
a solid waste and not a hazardous waste
 
05:40:40.628 --> 05:40:40.638 align:start position:0%
it could go to the landfill and likely i
 
05:40:42.548 --> 05:40:42.558 align:start position:0%
mean landfills depending on the nature
 
05:40:44.470 --> 05:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
of the mature their landfilling may make
 
05:40:46.868 --> 05:40:46.878 align:start position:0%
their own decisions about where and how
 
05:40:48.548 --> 05:40:48.558 align:start position:0%
they want to dispose of certain types of
 
05:40:50.548 --> 05:40:50.558 align:start position:0%
waste but there would no would be no
 
05:40:52.390 --> 05:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
specific requirement under state law to
 
05:40:54.708 --> 05:40:54.718 align:start position:0%
dispose of it any differently than
 
05:40:57.110 --> 05:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
other wastes that go into the landfill
 
05:40:58.310 --> 05:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:41:00.868 --> 05:41:00.878 align:start position:0%
representative kaplan
 
05:41:02.230 --> 05:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
05:41:03.750 --> 05:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
are you concerned at all that the epa
 
05:41:03.760 --> 05:41:04.628 align:start position:0%
are you concerned at all that the epa
hasn't

05:41:04.628 --> 05:41:04.638 align:start position:0%
hasn't
 
05:41:06.390 --> 05:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
issued any rulings on on these sort of
 
05:41:07.990 --> 05:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
facilities and i mean because usually
 
05:41:09.830 --> 05:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
you try to guide yourselves by what the
 
05:41:12.230 --> 05:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
epa is doing in most cases is that
 
05:41:12.240 --> 05:41:13.350 align:start position:0%
epa is doing in most cases is that
correct

05:41:13.350 --> 05:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:41:15.110 --> 05:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
sure so so there's really there's a
 
05:41:17.030 --> 05:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
couple things going on here um basically
 
05:41:20.230 --> 05:41:20.240 align:start position:0%
epa um does have very specific standards
 
05:41:23.110 --> 05:41:23.120 align:start position:0%
associated associated with the design
 
05:41:25.190 --> 05:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
and construction of what they call a
 
05:41:27.750 --> 05:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
subtitle d facility which is a under the
 
05:41:29.510 --> 05:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
resource conservation recovery act
 
05:41:31.910 --> 05:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
subtitle d covers solid waste and they
 
05:41:34.070 --> 05:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
have very specific requirements for how
 
05:41:35.190 --> 05:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
if you're going to have an approved
 
05:41:37.270 --> 05:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
program which new hampshire does how
 
05:41:38.788 --> 05:41:38.798 align:start position:0%
those landfills are designed and
 
05:41:41.590 --> 05:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
operated and in our rules for for
 
05:41:43.750 --> 05:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
governing those landfills um
 
05:41:45.350 --> 05:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
are are consistent with that and
 
05:41:47.350 --> 05:41:47.360 align:start position:0%
actually exceed the ex exceed the
 
05:41:49.190 --> 05:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
requirements in many respects of what's
 
05:41:50.948 --> 05:41:50.958 align:start position:0%
required at the federal level
 
05:41:52.628 --> 05:41:52.638 align:start position:0%
but as far as them looking at the
 
05:41:54.868 --> 05:41:54.878 align:start position:0%
specific activity i think that is more
 
05:41:57.670 --> 05:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
focused on air emissions issues than it
 
05:42:01.110 --> 05:42:01.120 align:start position:0%
is waste disposal so i haven't really
 
05:42:02.868 --> 05:42:02.878 align:start position:0%
familiarized myself with that debate
 
05:42:05.190 --> 05:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
that's going on right now and perhaps
 
05:42:09.270 --> 05:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:09.280 --> 05:42:10.230 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:42:10.230 --> 05:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:42:11.910 --> 05:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
from an air perspective
 
05:42:11.920 --> 05:42:13.190 align:start position:0%
from an air perspective
um

05:42:13.190 --> 05:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:42:14.788 --> 05:42:14.798 align:start position:0%
as you probably are aware we operate
 
05:42:17.190 --> 05:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
under the guise of the clean air act um
 
05:42:19.750 --> 05:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the race divisions
 
05:42:22.548 --> 05:42:22.558 align:start position:0%
federal regulations
 
05:42:22.558 --> 05:42:24.948 align:start position:0%
federal regulations
and

05:42:24.948 --> 05:42:24.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:27.590 --> 05:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
the these type of facilities would be
 
05:42:29.030 --> 05:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
treated just like any other
 
05:42:31.030 --> 05:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
manufacturing facility that coming into
 
05:42:32.788 --> 05:42:32.798 align:start position:0%
the state we would address
 
05:42:34.390 --> 05:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
meet with them take a look at the
 
05:42:36.868 --> 05:42:36.878 align:start position:0%
specific process as mike mentioned
 
05:42:38.788 --> 05:42:38.798 align:start position:0%
and make a determination
 
05:42:40.390 --> 05:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
the bill that you have in front of you
 
05:42:40.400 --> 05:42:42.310 align:start position:0%
the bill that you have in front of you
proposes

05:42:42.310 --> 05:42:42.320 align:start position:0%
proposes
 
05:42:45.270 --> 05:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
revisions to to rsa 149m which is a
 
05:42:47.590 --> 05:42:47.600 align:start position:0%
solid waste statute
 
05:42:50.708 --> 05:42:50.718 align:start position:0%
it would not have any impact on
 
05:42:54.628 --> 05:42:54.638 align:start position:0%
rsa 125c and rsa 125i
 
05:42:57.590 --> 05:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
which are the statutes that we operate
 
05:42:57.600 --> 05:42:58.390 align:start position:0%
which are the statutes that we operate
under

05:42:58.390 --> 05:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
under
 
05:43:01.110 --> 05:43:01.120 align:start position:0%
and we also have
 
05:43:01.120 --> 05:43:02.948 align:start position:0%
and we also have
state

05:43:02.948 --> 05:43:02.958 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:43:05.270 --> 05:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
authority for implementing the clean air
 
05:43:08.310 --> 05:43:08.320 align:start position:0%
act on a federal basis
 
05:43:09.270 --> 05:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
and so
 
05:43:11.670 --> 05:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
i would like to ask todd for for a
 
05:43:13.830 --> 05:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
moment there is a currently a dialogue
 
05:43:14.868 --> 05:43:14.878 align:start position:0%
going on
 
05:43:17.670 --> 05:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
regarding air regulations for these type
 
05:43:20.548 --> 05:43:20.558 align:start position:0%
of facilities
 
05:43:20.558 --> 05:43:21.750 align:start position:0%
of facilities
epa

05:43:21.750 --> 05:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
epa
 
05:43:23.670 --> 05:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
recently issued
 
05:43:25.510 --> 05:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
a request for
 
05:43:28.470 --> 05:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
information to be submitted to them
 
05:43:30.868 --> 05:43:30.878 align:start position:0%
in in their consideration of revisions
 
05:43:33.110 --> 05:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
to what's known as um the osweg
 
05:43:35.030 --> 05:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
regulations other solid waste
 
05:43:35.040 --> 05:43:36.708 align:start position:0%
regulations other solid waste
incinerators

05:43:36.708 --> 05:43:36.718 align:start position:0%
incinerators
 
05:43:36.718 --> 05:43:37.590 align:start position:0%
incinerators
so

05:43:37.590 --> 05:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:43:39.350 --> 05:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
um but they're what they're doing is
 
05:43:40.470 --> 05:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
they're looking at these type of
 
05:43:42.230 --> 05:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
facilities and so i'd like to ask todd
 
05:43:44.548 --> 05:43:44.558 align:start position:0%
if he could kind of just summarize
 
05:43:46.628 --> 05:43:46.638 align:start position:0%
briefly what what epa's doing and what
 
05:43:52.548 --> 05:43:52.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:54.390 --> 05:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
i'll scoot out
 
05:43:56.070 --> 05:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
todd moore i'm the air permitting
 
05:43:58.708 --> 05:43:58.718 align:start position:0%
programs manager at des
 
05:44:01.510 --> 05:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
relative to federal action
 
05:44:05.030 --> 05:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
epa on the air side clean air act
 
05:44:07.030 --> 05:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
has a section that specifically targets
 
05:44:09.190 --> 05:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
solid waste incinerators
 
05:44:11.190 --> 05:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
for many years
 
05:44:13.750 --> 05:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
both the industry and epa and us
 
05:44:15.510 --> 05:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
implementing these rules have struggled
 
05:44:19.590 --> 05:44:19.600 align:start position:0%
with where does pyrolysis gasification
 
05:44:21.350 --> 05:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
where do those types of facilities fit
 
05:44:21.360 --> 05:44:23.030 align:start position:0%
where do those types of facilities fit
in

05:44:23.030 --> 05:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:44:24.868 --> 05:44:24.878 align:start position:0%
epa recognizing
 
05:44:26.628 --> 05:44:26.638 align:start position:0%
well i think what they said is they
 
05:44:28.628 --> 05:44:28.638 align:start position:0%
recognize it's not clear
 
05:44:30.788 --> 05:44:30.798 align:start position:0%
in the existing structure and also
 
05:44:33.270 --> 05:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
they've had a number of inquiries um
 
05:44:35.910 --> 05:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
recently about people wanting to use
 
05:44:37.350 --> 05:44:37.360 align:start position:0%
these types of facilities so what
 
05:44:41.350 --> 05:44:41.360 align:start position:0%
they've done is they issued a rule
 
05:44:43.030 --> 05:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
they they requested officially
 
05:44:44.628 --> 05:44:44.638 align:start position:0%
information so they opened a public
 
05:44:46.708 --> 05:44:46.718 align:start position:0%
comment period i believe that
 
05:44:48.548 --> 05:44:48.558 align:start position:0%
chemistry council submitted comments
 
05:44:51.270 --> 05:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
similar to what their um you know some
 
05:44:52.548 --> 05:44:52.558 align:start position:0%
of the things that they've said here
 
05:44:54.628 --> 05:44:54.638 align:start position:0%
today is it fair to say though that this
 
05:44:57.030 --> 05:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh industrial process is in its early
 
05:44:58.548 --> 05:44:58.558 align:start position:0%
days so to speak and so therefore
 
05:44:58.558 --> 05:44:59.350 align:start position:0%
days so to speak and so therefore
they're

05:44:59.350 --> 05:44:59.360 align:start position:0%
they're
 
05:45:00.868 --> 05:45:00.878 align:start position:0%
they're trying to gather more
 
05:45:02.788 --> 05:45:02.798 align:start position:0%
information in terms of
 
05:45:05.110 --> 05:45:05.120 align:start position:0%
the emissions so that they can issue the
 
05:45:07.030 --> 05:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
specific guidelines that
 
05:45:09.830 --> 05:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
that the public would require
 
05:45:12.070 --> 05:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not as familiar with the actual if
 
05:45:13.830 --> 05:45:13.840 align:start position:0%
you're saying that if the industry
 
05:45:16.390 --> 05:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
itself is still in its infancy i'm not
 
05:45:18.548 --> 05:45:18.558 align:start position:0%
sure i think these types of
 
05:45:21.110 --> 05:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
chemical processes are probably in use
 
05:45:24.310 --> 05:45:24.320 align:start position:0%
in various manufacturing facilities
 
05:45:26.628 --> 05:45:26.638 align:start position:0%
but maybe how they're being used but
 
05:45:29.270 --> 05:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
again it's been
 
05:45:31.750 --> 05:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
a number of years now that people have
 
05:45:33.990 --> 05:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
struggled to figure out where they fit
 
05:45:36.708 --> 05:45:36.718 align:start position:0%
into incinerator regulations and i
 
05:45:38.548 --> 05:45:38.558 align:start position:0%
you know i don't want to speak for epa
 
05:45:41.190 --> 05:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
but those incinerator regulations were
 
05:45:43.430 --> 05:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
primarily developed looking at your
 
05:45:46.628 --> 05:45:46.638 align:start position:0%
classic incinerators uh recognizing
 
05:45:48.390 --> 05:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
these are not those
 
05:45:49.510 --> 05:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
one more
 
05:45:50.868 --> 05:45:50.878 align:start position:0%
yep one more and then i'll go to
 
05:45:50.878 --> 05:45:51.990 align:start position:0%
yep one more and then i'll go to
representative

05:45:51.990 --> 05:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:45:53.510 --> 05:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
we just heard anecdotally from the
 
05:45:55.990 --> 05:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
gentleman speaking before about uh smoke
 
05:45:57.670 --> 05:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
tac testing at some of these facilities
 
05:45:59.350 --> 05:45:59.360 align:start position:0%
in ohio i believe is that your
 
05:46:01.430 --> 05:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
understanding on the the
 
05:46:02.948 --> 05:46:02.958 align:start position:0%
manufacturing regulations that that
 
05:46:04.628 --> 05:46:04.638 align:start position:0%
would happen in new hampshire that would
 
05:46:06.788 --> 05:46:06.798 align:start position:0%
that the des would go in and test the
 
05:46:09.750 --> 05:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
smoke tax smokestack at these facilities
 
05:46:09.760 --> 05:46:10.548 align:start position:0%
smoke tax smokestack at these facilities
um

05:46:10.548 --> 05:46:10.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:12.070 --> 05:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
05:46:13.670 --> 05:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
separate set of manufacturing
 
05:46:16.708 --> 05:46:16.718 align:start position:0%
regulations per se
 
05:46:18.470 --> 05:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
if somebody were to propose a facility
 
05:46:19.910 --> 05:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
05:46:22.868 --> 05:46:22.878 align:start position:0%
we would need specific details on size
 
05:46:24.948 --> 05:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
type what are they doing what materials
 
05:46:26.628 --> 05:46:26.638 align:start position:0%
are they using we would take that
 
05:46:28.788 --> 05:46:28.798 align:start position:0%
information determine whether
 
05:46:31.510 --> 05:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
or not any of the existing rules apply
 
05:46:32.868 --> 05:46:32.878 align:start position:0%
i don't know i'm not familiar with the
 
05:46:35.670 --> 05:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
ohio facility they may because of the
 
05:46:37.990 --> 05:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
current regulate regulatory structure be
 
05:46:39.910 --> 05:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
subject to federal incinerated
 
05:46:41.670 --> 05:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
regulations that that prompted the
 
05:46:44.628 --> 05:46:44.638 align:start position:0%
testing i'm not really sure
 
05:46:46.788 --> 05:46:46.798 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you thank you representative
 
05:46:49.510 --> 05:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
i'd like to if i could just clarify
 
05:46:51.350 --> 05:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
again we would look at this process as
 
05:46:53.750 --> 05:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
we would look at any company coming into
 
05:46:55.270 --> 05:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire for
 
05:46:57.590 --> 05:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh within with a new manufacturing
 
05:46:59.590 --> 05:46:59.600 align:start position:0%
process we would meet with them as todd
 
05:47:01.350 --> 05:47:01.360 align:start position:0%
said we would
 
05:47:03.830 --> 05:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
evaluate they would provide us with
 
05:47:06.548 --> 05:47:06.558 align:start position:0%
specific detailed diagrams and drawings
 
05:47:08.150 --> 05:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
and so on as to
 
05:47:10.230 --> 05:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
what the process is what the inputs are
 
05:47:11.830 --> 05:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
what the outputs are
 
05:47:14.070 --> 05:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
and we would compare that against our
 
05:47:16.628 --> 05:47:16.638 align:start position:0%
existing state regulations and any
 
05:47:19.190 --> 05:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
federal regulations to determine what is
 
05:47:22.548 --> 05:47:22.558 align:start position:0%
applicable and from there we would issue
 
05:47:24.470 --> 05:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
if necessary if it was applicable we
 
05:47:26.788 --> 05:47:26.798 align:start position:0%
would issue a permit
 
05:47:30.708 --> 05:47:30.718 align:start position:0%
pursuant to a stat to rsa 125c or 125i
 
05:47:32.548 --> 05:47:32.558 align:start position:0%
which is a toxic
 
05:47:32.558 --> 05:47:33.910 align:start position:0%
which is a toxic
regulation

05:47:33.910 --> 05:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
05:47:35.510 --> 05:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
and that permit
 
05:47:38.230 --> 05:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
may or may not incorporate
 
05:47:38.240 --> 05:47:39.110 align:start position:0%
may or may not incorporate
um

05:47:39.110 --> 05:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:47:41.190 --> 05:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
testing requirements and stack testing
 
05:47:43.830 --> 05:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
so on depending on on what we
 
05:47:45.670 --> 05:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
what we determine so everything would be
 
05:47:48.230 --> 05:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
very process specific and
 
05:47:48.240 --> 05:47:49.110 align:start position:0%
very process specific and
any

05:47:49.110 --> 05:47:49.120 align:start position:0%
any
 
05:47:51.910 --> 05:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
definition of paralysis or gasification
 
05:47:53.190 --> 05:47:53.200 align:start position:0%
or anything
 
05:47:55.270 --> 05:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
really would be sort of irrelevant from
 
05:47:57.270 --> 05:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
our perspective it's just
 
05:47:58.628 --> 05:47:58.638 align:start position:0%
what's going in
 
05:48:00.470 --> 05:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
what's coming out
 
05:48:02.150 --> 05:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
what's being emitted
 
05:48:04.708 --> 05:48:04.718 align:start position:0%
and is it regulated under either rsa
 
05:48:07.510 --> 05:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
125c or 125i
 
05:48:07.520 --> 05:48:08.830 align:start position:0%
125c or 125i
um

05:48:08.830 --> 05:48:08.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:11.750 --> 05:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:48:13.270 --> 05:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
if there were any
 
05:48:15.910 --> 05:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh determination of of applicability of
 
05:48:18.150 --> 05:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
some clean air act uh requirement that's
 
05:48:20.230 --> 05:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
above and beyond those
 
05:48:22.070 --> 05:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative and then
 
05:48:23.510 --> 05:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
representative bixby
 
05:48:24.868 --> 05:48:24.878 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
05:48:26.868 --> 05:48:26.878 align:start position:0%
gentlemen for taking my question i have
 
05:48:27.830 --> 05:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
a couple
 
05:48:27.840 --> 05:48:29.670 align:start position:0%
a couple
um

05:48:29.670 --> 05:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:31.190 --> 05:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
would this
 
05:48:32.470 --> 05:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
based on
 
05:48:34.150 --> 05:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
i guess my question is is because you're
 
05:48:36.310 --> 05:48:36.320 align:start position:0%
solid waste
 
05:48:38.788 --> 05:48:38.798 align:start position:0%
and the des but you said it it doesn't
 
05:48:40.868 --> 05:48:40.878 align:start position:0%
matter if it's a manufacturing facility
 
05:48:40.878 --> 05:48:41.990 align:start position:0%
matter if it's a manufacturing facility
or

05:48:41.990 --> 05:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:48:44.548 --> 05:48:44.558 align:start position:0%
anything the rsa does not change is that
 
05:48:46.310 --> 05:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
correct that's that's because the year
 
05:48:48.070 --> 05:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
statutes are applicable no matter what
 
05:48:50.230 --> 05:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
the regulatory status is under under a
 
05:48:52.788 --> 05:48:52.798 align:start position:0%
different program okay follow up
 
05:48:52.798 --> 05:48:53.670 align:start position:0%
different program okay follow up
um

05:48:53.670 --> 05:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:56.390 --> 05:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
if if um
 
05:48:58.390 --> 05:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
do you know of
 
05:48:59.830 --> 05:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
any of these other plants in other
 
05:49:02.070 --> 05:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
states how they're doing the air quality
 
05:49:04.628 --> 05:49:04.638 align:start position:0%
and how it would affect our statutes in
 
05:49:08.070 --> 05:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
this state and what manpower would take
 
05:49:10.628 --> 05:49:10.638 align:start position:0%
to do testing
 
05:49:10.638 --> 05:49:11.430 align:start position:0%
to do testing
we

05:49:11.430 --> 05:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:49:13.830 --> 05:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
we really have not looked at this
 
05:49:15.990 --> 05:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
too carefully because we we haven't been
 
05:49:18.868 --> 05:49:18.878 align:start position:0%
approached with a a facility there there
 
05:49:20.390 --> 05:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
is one facility that's doing some
 
05:49:23.190 --> 05:49:23.200 align:start position:0%
processing up in uh groveton
 
05:49:25.190 --> 05:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
that approached us um
 
05:49:25.200 --> 05:49:26.310 align:start position:0%
that approached us um
and

05:49:26.310 --> 05:49:26.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:49:29.270 --> 05:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
we made a determination that uh
 
05:49:30.948 --> 05:49:30.958 align:start position:0%
based on the information they provided
 
05:49:33.030 --> 05:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
us that that was a closed loop facility
 
05:49:35.110 --> 05:49:35.120 align:start position:0%
that there were no air emissions
 
05:49:36.310 --> 05:49:36.320 align:start position:0%
and that
 
05:49:36.320 --> 05:49:37.110 align:start position:0%
and that
those

05:49:37.110 --> 05:49:37.120 align:start position:0%
those
 
05:49:39.990 --> 05:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh that that facility
 
05:49:42.230 --> 05:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
they had originally proposed that one of
 
05:49:44.070 --> 05:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
the products that they would come from
 
05:49:45.990 --> 05:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
that would be used as a fuel for a
 
05:49:46.000 --> 05:49:47.590 align:start position:0%
that would be used as a fuel for a
generator

05:49:47.590 --> 05:49:47.600 align:start position:0%
generator
 
05:49:50.070 --> 05:49:50.080 align:start position:0%
on site but they subsequently came to us
 
05:49:51.750 --> 05:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
and said no the generator will only be
 
05:49:53.750 --> 05:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
fueled with diesel fuel
 
05:49:56.708 --> 05:49:56.718 align:start position:0%
and so we issued a permit for that
 
05:49:59.270 --> 05:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
facility so but as to what's happened in
 
05:50:01.030 --> 05:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
in other
 
05:50:04.470 --> 05:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
uh other states and so on we we have not
 
05:50:07.510 --> 05:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
been approached with a specific facility
 
05:50:09.590 --> 05:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
that we would want to evaluate but
 
05:50:11.830 --> 05:50:11.840 align:start position:0%
certainly if that were the case we would
 
05:50:13.270 --> 05:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
look to
 
05:50:15.110 --> 05:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
similar facilities in other states and
 
05:50:17.750 --> 05:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
see what determinations had been made
 
05:50:20.150 --> 05:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
but again it would be specific to the
 
05:50:21.990 --> 05:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
process and the facility
 
05:50:23.590 --> 05:50:23.600 align:start position:0%
that's being proposed
 
05:50:24.948 --> 05:50:24.958 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
05:50:27.750 --> 05:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair yeah my i guess um
 
05:50:30.070 --> 05:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
i understand uh that the groveton is a
 
05:50:32.230 --> 05:50:32.240 align:start position:0%
closed loop facility but they're talking
 
05:50:33.670 --> 05:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if the facility that
 
05:50:35.830 --> 05:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
would be proposed in new hampshire
 
05:50:38.230 --> 05:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
would have smoke stacks but apparently
 
05:50:40.868 --> 05:50:40.878 align:start position:0%
um that has been mentioned
 
05:50:42.310 --> 05:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
and obviously
 
05:50:44.548 --> 05:50:44.558 align:start position:0%
there is an emission through smoke
 
05:50:48.948 --> 05:50:48.958 align:start position:0%
stacks so how would des handle that
 
05:50:50.390 --> 05:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
same as we would handle any other
 
05:50:52.150 --> 05:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
smokestack industry in the state we
 
05:50:54.548 --> 05:50:54.558 align:start position:0%
would they would again come to us we'd
 
05:50:56.150 --> 05:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
evaluate the process
 
05:50:59.190 --> 05:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
we'd look at all the inputs and outputs
 
05:51:00.708 --> 05:51:00.718 align:start position:0%
and determine
 
05:51:04.390 --> 05:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
our statutes are very clear as to
 
05:51:05.510 --> 05:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
if there are certain levels of
 
05:51:05.520 --> 05:51:06.788 align:start position:0%
if there are certain levels of
contaminants

05:51:06.788 --> 05:51:06.798 align:start position:0%
contaminants
 
05:51:08.628 --> 05:51:08.638 align:start position:0%
that could be emitted
 
05:51:11.030 --> 05:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
they they would be
 
05:51:12.948 --> 05:51:12.958 align:start position:0%
they would be required to be controlled
 
05:51:14.628 --> 05:51:14.638 align:start position:0%
and they would be they would be required
 
05:51:17.030 --> 05:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
to have process controls
 
05:51:19.270 --> 05:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
um and that would all be incorporated
 
05:51:20.788 --> 05:51:20.798 align:start position:0%
into a permit that we would issue and
 
05:51:23.270 --> 05:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
that would be subject to public
 
05:51:25.670 --> 05:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
input we don't we'd hold a hearing
 
05:51:27.830 --> 05:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
receive input on that permit
 
05:51:30.390 --> 05:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
and ultimately issue a issue a permit
 
05:51:33.910 --> 05:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:35.910 --> 05:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps controls
 
05:51:35.920 --> 05:51:37.110 align:start position:0%
perhaps controls
and

05:51:37.110 --> 05:51:37.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:51:37.120 --> 05:51:38.310 align:start position:0%
and
also

05:51:38.310 --> 05:51:38.320 align:start position:0%
also
 
05:51:40.628 --> 05:51:40.638 align:start position:0%
could require a schedule of air testing
 
05:51:43.350 --> 05:51:43.360 align:start position:0%
stack testing um but again it would be
 
05:51:44.548 --> 05:51:44.558 align:start position:0%
no different
 
05:51:46.708 --> 05:51:46.718 align:start position:0%
than how we would approach any other
 
05:51:48.548 --> 05:51:48.558 align:start position:0%
manufacturing facility in the state we
 
05:51:50.070 --> 05:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
have hundreds of facilities here in the
 
05:51:52.628 --> 05:51:52.638 align:start position:0%
state that have permits and do
 
05:51:55.110 --> 05:51:55.120 align:start position:0%
you know do routine stack testing we go
 
05:51:57.990 --> 05:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
out we observe those stack tests we
 
05:51:59.750 --> 05:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
review their records and conduct
 
05:52:01.350 --> 05:52:01.360 align:start position:0%
inspections and so on and make sure that
 
05:52:02.628 --> 05:52:02.638 align:start position:0%
they're operating in accordance with
 
05:52:04.948 --> 05:52:04.958 align:start position:0%
their permit
 
05:52:08.708 --> 05:52:08.718 align:start position:0%
representative bixby yes thank you um
 
05:52:08.718 --> 05:52:10.150 align:start position:0%
representative bixby yes thank you um
so

05:52:10.150 --> 05:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:52:13.590 --> 05:52:13.600 align:start position:0%
it sounds like there there's a range of
 
05:52:17.190 --> 05:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
um stack emissions that are clearly uh
 
05:52:18.948 --> 05:52:18.958 align:start position:0%
covered by the
 
05:52:21.830 --> 05:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh clean air act and by our state
 
05:52:21.840 --> 05:52:23.030 align:start position:0%
uh clean air act and by our state
statutes

05:52:23.030 --> 05:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
05:52:25.750 --> 05:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
are there potential emissions that
 
05:52:28.150 --> 05:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
are not covered by that
 
05:52:30.470 --> 05:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
are there compounds that may not be
 
05:52:32.070 --> 05:52:32.080 align:start position:0%
specifically identified that could
 
05:52:35.990 --> 05:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
conceivably be coming out of a stack
 
05:52:36.000 --> 05:52:37.190 align:start position:0%
conceivably be coming out of a stack
um

05:52:37.190 --> 05:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:52:39.750 --> 05:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
the clean air act is very clear it has a
 
05:52:41.350 --> 05:52:41.360 align:start position:0%
list of hundreds of we're known as
 
05:52:43.510 --> 05:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
hazardous air pollutants haps
 
05:52:47.910 --> 05:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
we have a regulation known as enva 1400
 
05:52:50.708 --> 05:52:50.718 align:start position:0%
uh which is pursuant to rsa 125i the
 
05:52:52.948 --> 05:52:52.958 align:start position:0%
toxic statute
 
05:52:56.230 --> 05:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
that has again i believe todd 700 some
 
05:52:57.750 --> 05:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
compounds on it
 
05:53:00.230 --> 05:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
that we would we would require a
 
05:53:01.910 --> 05:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
determination to be made if they're
 
05:53:04.788 --> 05:53:04.798 align:start position:0%
emitting any of those compounds
 
05:53:07.590 --> 05:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
i suspect that you may be
 
05:53:11.190 --> 05:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
alluding or concerned about pfas um uh
 
05:53:13.910 --> 05:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
fast dioxin
 
05:53:15.030 --> 05:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
and and
 
05:53:16.470 --> 05:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
all of those are all of those are
 
05:53:18.548 --> 05:53:18.558 align:start position:0%
covered and i just want to with regards
 
05:53:21.110 --> 05:53:21.120 align:start position:0%
to pfas
 
05:53:24.948 --> 05:53:24.958 align:start position:0%
back in 2016 with the
 
05:53:27.350 --> 05:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
determination of the air emissions
 
05:53:29.510 --> 05:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
problem in southern new hampshire
 
05:53:31.190 --> 05:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
related to a manufacturing facility in
 
05:53:32.708 --> 05:53:32.718 align:start position:0%
merrimack there
 
05:53:34.948 --> 05:53:34.958 align:start position:0%
well the legislature passed a new
 
05:53:34.958 --> 05:53:36.230 align:start position:0%
well the legislature passed a new
statute

05:53:36.230 --> 05:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
statute
 
05:53:39.110 --> 05:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
that amended rsa 125 c that gave us very
 
05:53:41.910 --> 05:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
specific authority with regards to
 
05:53:44.788 --> 05:53:44.798 align:start position:0%
certain pfas compounds
 
05:53:44.798 --> 05:53:45.990 align:start position:0%
certain pfas compounds
and and

05:53:45.990 --> 05:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
and and
 
05:53:46.000 --> 05:53:47.030 align:start position:0%
and and
so

05:53:47.030 --> 05:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:53:49.430 --> 05:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
that we would also measure
 
05:53:51.590 --> 05:53:51.600 align:start position:0%
and and determine whether
 
05:53:54.230 --> 05:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
that law that statute applied
 
05:53:56.868 --> 05:53:56.878 align:start position:0%
um to ensure that that uh
 
05:53:58.628 --> 05:53:58.638 align:start position:0%
pfas compounds were addressed but the
 
05:54:00.868 --> 05:54:00.878 align:start position:0%
whole suite of of other compounds would
 
05:54:03.030 --> 05:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
be would be looked at that's you know
 
05:54:06.470 --> 05:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
hundreds of vpa haps and our 700 under
 
05:54:08.230 --> 05:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
our toxics laws
 
05:54:09.990 --> 05:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
05:54:12.470 --> 05:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
we'd make a determination that in that
 
05:54:15.110 --> 05:54:15.120 align:start position:0%
right relative to those yeah i i
 
05:54:18.628 --> 05:54:18.638 align:start position:0%
i guess one of my concerns is that um
 
05:54:19.750 --> 05:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
there are
 
05:54:22.230 --> 05:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
a certain number of identified p-pass
 
05:54:24.708 --> 05:54:24.718 align:start position:0%
compounds and there are others that are
 
05:54:26.830 --> 05:54:26.840 align:start position:0%
not yet
 
05:54:29.110 --> 05:54:29.120 align:start position:0%
categorized uh and
 
05:54:31.190 --> 05:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh there are you know
 
05:54:33.350 --> 05:54:33.360 align:start position:0%
potentially other compounds that we may
 
05:54:34.868 --> 05:54:34.878 align:start position:0%
not i mean at one at some point we
 
05:54:36.868 --> 05:54:36.878 align:start position:0%
didn't realize that pfas was an issue
 
05:54:39.510 --> 05:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
and now we do and i'm wondering about
 
05:54:41.990 --> 05:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
those other potential compounds that we
 
05:54:43.670 --> 05:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
don't recognize as an issue at the
 
05:54:46.548 --> 05:54:46.558 align:start position:0%
moment but in fact may be
 
05:54:48.628 --> 05:54:48.638 align:start position:0%
so again uh
 
05:54:51.990 --> 05:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh the revisions to rsa 125c in 2016
 
05:54:54.628 --> 05:54:54.638 align:start position:0%
were intended to address not only
 
05:54:54.638 --> 05:54:55.590 align:start position:0%
were intended to address not only
those

05:54:55.590 --> 05:54:55.600 align:start position:0%
those
 
05:54:57.750 --> 05:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
pfast compounds that we know
 
05:54:59.350 --> 05:54:59.360 align:start position:0%
but also
 
05:55:01.110 --> 05:55:01.120 align:start position:0%
what are we referred to as sort of an
 
05:55:01.120 --> 05:55:02.150 align:start position:0%
what are we referred to as sort of an
emerging

05:55:02.150 --> 05:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
emerging
 
05:55:04.470 --> 05:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
emerging contaminants and
 
05:55:05.910 --> 05:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
again as you mentioned there are
 
05:55:08.150 --> 05:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
hundreds of pfas
 
05:55:08.160 --> 05:55:10.150 align:start position:0%
hundreds of pfas
compounds

05:55:10.150 --> 05:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
compounds
 
05:55:15.270 --> 05:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:18.708 --> 05:55:18.718 align:start position:0%
really relatively few of those compounds
 
05:55:21.750 --> 05:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
pose an air inhalation risk
 
05:55:25.190 --> 05:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
the changes to 125c that we made in 2016
 
05:55:27.750 --> 05:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
and working with the legislature on
 
05:55:27.760 --> 05:55:28.868 align:start position:0%
and working with the legislature on
were

05:55:28.868 --> 05:55:28.878 align:start position:0%
were
 
05:55:31.190 --> 05:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
relative to how those compounds were
 
05:55:32.788 --> 05:55:32.798 align:start position:0%
emitted into the air
 
05:55:35.030 --> 05:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
then landed on the ground then got into
 
05:55:37.270 --> 05:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
groundwater because that is a much more
 
05:55:39.030 --> 05:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
prevalent and much more
 
05:55:39.040 --> 05:55:40.150 align:start position:0%
prevalent and much more
uh

05:55:40.150 --> 05:55:40.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:55:42.868 --> 05:55:42.878 align:start position:0%
significant route of exposure
 
05:55:44.470 --> 05:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
drinking water that contains those
 
05:55:46.788 --> 05:55:46.798 align:start position:0%
compounds is vastly different than
 
05:55:48.390 --> 05:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
inhaling air
 
05:55:50.708 --> 05:55:50.718 align:start position:0%
that contains them in terms in terms of
 
05:55:52.948 --> 05:55:52.958 align:start position:0%
the risks for those compounds
 
05:55:56.070 --> 05:55:56.080 align:start position:0%
so the way that statute reads is
 
05:55:56.080 --> 05:55:57.670 align:start position:0%
so the way that statute reads is
if

05:55:57.670 --> 05:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:56:00.230 --> 05:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
in our waste and water divisions if we
 
05:56:02.548 --> 05:56:02.558 align:start position:0%
make a determination that some one of
 
05:56:04.470 --> 05:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
those pfas compounds
 
05:56:07.430 --> 05:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
is regulated from a water standpoint
 
05:56:07.440 --> 05:56:08.390 align:start position:0%
is regulated from a water standpoint
then

05:56:08.390 --> 05:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
then
 
05:56:11.030 --> 05:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
the way the new revision to 125c works
 
05:56:13.110 --> 05:56:13.120 align:start position:0%
is if that compound is emitted into the
 
05:56:13.120 --> 05:56:14.390 align:start position:0%
is if that compound is emitted into the
air

05:56:14.390 --> 05:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
air
 
05:56:16.868 --> 05:56:16.878 align:start position:0%
we would then model and test to
 
05:56:19.110 --> 05:56:19.120 align:start position:0%
determine does it have the potential to
 
05:56:20.868 --> 05:56:20.878 align:start position:0%
contaminate the water
 
05:56:23.270 --> 05:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
if it did then we would limit it
 
05:56:25.110 --> 05:56:25.120 align:start position:0%
in such a way so that there would be no
 
05:56:26.548 --> 05:56:26.558 align:start position:0%
impact to
 
05:56:29.190 --> 05:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
to surrounding water bodies
 
05:56:31.510 --> 05:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
the science of inhalation risk with
 
05:56:33.750 --> 05:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
regards to these compounds
 
05:56:33.760 --> 05:56:34.628 align:start position:0%
regards to these compounds
is

05:56:34.628 --> 05:56:34.638 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:56:34.638 --> 05:56:36.070 align:start position:0%
is
developing

05:56:36.070 --> 05:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
developing
 
05:56:38.310 --> 05:56:38.320 align:start position:0%
there is currently a bill that was just
 
05:56:40.708 --> 05:56:40.718 align:start position:0%
heard today i believe it was heard here
 
05:56:42.230 --> 05:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
in the house
 
05:56:44.670 --> 05:56:44.680 align:start position:0%
it was a house bill
 
05:56:47.510 --> 05:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
1546 i believe
 
05:56:49.750 --> 05:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
related to
 
05:56:52.548 --> 05:56:52.558 align:start position:0%
air emissions of perfluorochemicals and
 
05:56:54.708 --> 05:56:54.718 align:start position:0%
pfas compounds
 
05:56:56.708 --> 05:56:56.718 align:start position:0%
and it was just
 
05:56:58.390 --> 05:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
voted in the senate
 
05:56:59.750 --> 05:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
05:57:02.868 --> 05:57:02.878 align:start position:0%
voted in the senate committee today and
 
05:57:02.878 --> 05:57:04.070 align:start position:0%
voted in the senate committee today and
that

05:57:04.070 --> 05:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:57:04.080 --> 05:57:05.750 align:start position:0%
that
bill

05:57:05.750 --> 05:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:57:08.948 --> 05:57:08.958 align:start position:0%
would require requires us to
 
05:57:11.750 --> 05:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
annually look at all of the
 
05:57:14.310 --> 05:57:14.320 align:start position:0%
scientific literature related to air
 
05:57:18.390 --> 05:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
inhalation risk of pfast compounds
 
05:57:18.400 --> 05:57:19.270 align:start position:0%
inhalation risk of pfast compounds
and

05:57:19.270 --> 05:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:57:21.110 --> 05:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
do a report to the legislature and
 
05:57:23.670 --> 05:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
report out whether we intend to regulate
 
05:57:25.750 --> 05:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
one of those compounds
 
05:57:27.750 --> 05:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
on the basis of air so we we actually
 
05:57:30.230 --> 05:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
look at pfas on two fronts we look at it
 
05:57:32.788 --> 05:57:32.798 align:start position:0%
for its potential to contaminate water
 
05:57:33.910 --> 05:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
which is
 
05:57:35.510 --> 05:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
a much more well established and
 
05:57:37.910 --> 05:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
significant exposure route
 
05:57:41.110 --> 05:57:41.120 align:start position:0%
and its potential for air emissions the
 
05:57:42.628 --> 05:57:42.638 align:start position:0%
same as we would do with any of the
 
05:57:45.270 --> 05:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
other hundreds of compounds that are on
 
05:57:46.470 --> 05:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
on our list
 
05:57:49.510 --> 05:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
and so so this build now requires us
 
05:57:50.628 --> 05:57:50.638 align:start position:0%
assuming that it's signed by the
 
05:57:52.310 --> 05:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
governor would require us to annually
 
05:57:53.510 --> 05:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
look at
 
05:57:53.520 --> 05:57:54.708 align:start position:0%
look at
at

05:57:54.708 --> 05:57:54.718 align:start position:0%
at
 
05:57:56.628 --> 05:57:56.638 align:start position:0%
all the literature related to pfas
 
05:57:58.548 --> 05:57:58.558 align:start position:0%
inhalation and make a determination if
 
05:58:01.110 --> 05:58:01.120 align:start position:0%
we needed to add them to our list
 
05:58:04.230 --> 05:58:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:06.548 --> 05:58:06.558 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for the
 
05:58:06.558 --> 05:58:08.470 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for the
department

05:58:08.470 --> 05:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
department
 
05:58:10.390 --> 05:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh representative kaplan i have a
 
05:58:12.310 --> 05:58:12.320 align:start position:0%
general question i don't know if any
 
05:58:13.670 --> 05:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
gentleman can answer it's about the
 
05:58:15.350 --> 05:58:15.360 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas
 
05:58:16.470 --> 05:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
issue and
 
05:58:18.150 --> 05:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
we heard that
 
05:58:19.990 --> 05:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
this process would lower greenhouse
 
05:58:22.628 --> 05:58:22.638 align:start position:0%
gases compared i believe to our current
 
05:58:22.638 --> 05:58:23.990 align:start position:0%
gases compared i believe to our current
recycling

05:58:23.990 --> 05:58:24.000 align:start position:0%

05:58:27.590 --> 05:58:27.600 align:start position:0%
do you like do you does your department
 
05:58:29.110 --> 05:58:29.120 align:start position:0%
do any calculations around the
 
05:58:30.868 --> 05:58:30.878 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas or the carbon uh
 
05:58:33.670 --> 05:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
footprint of this process compared to
 
05:58:36.470 --> 05:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh say actually trying to reduce the
 
05:58:38.470 --> 05:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
amount of plastic that we use we we do
 
05:58:40.310 --> 05:58:40.320 align:start position:0%
in general but i would i would defer to
 
05:58:42.310 --> 05:58:42.320 align:start position:0%
the gentleman from acc we haven't looked
 
05:58:45.030 --> 05:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
at this issue specifically but i uh he
 
05:58:47.270 --> 05:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
did indicate that they had done some
 
05:58:47.280 --> 05:58:47.660 align:start position:0%
did indicate that they had done some
um

05:58:47.660 --> 05:58:47.670 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:58:47.670 --> 05:58:48.788 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

[Music]
 
05:58:51.590 --> 05:58:51.600 align:start position:0%
that they had done some studies uh which
 
05:58:53.350 --> 05:58:53.360 align:start position:0%
it's a very complicated subject because
 
05:58:55.350 --> 05:58:55.360 align:start position:0%
you have to look at the full process
 
05:58:57.910 --> 05:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
heat that's being used to the
 
05:58:59.190 --> 05:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
energy that's being used to heat the
 
05:58:59.200 --> 05:59:00.070 align:start position:0%
energy that's being used to heat the
process

05:59:00.070 --> 05:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
process
 
05:59:01.750 --> 05:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
what happens to the
 
05:59:04.310 --> 05:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
uh to the ultimate products and so on um
 
05:59:07.270 --> 05:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
but but i i would assume that if
 
05:59:08.708 --> 05:59:08.718 align:start position:0%
you know that there's there may be
 
05:59:10.150 --> 05:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
studies out there that show that the
 
05:59:12.070 --> 05:59:12.080 align:start position:0%
overall um
 
05:59:14.948 --> 05:59:14.958 align:start position:0%
uh use of of uh or emissions of
 
05:59:16.548 --> 05:59:16.558 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gases
 
05:59:16.558 --> 05:59:17.510 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gases
um

05:59:17.510 --> 05:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:59:20.628 --> 05:59:20.638 align:start position:0%
uh i i wouldn't doubt that it could be
 
05:59:22.390 --> 05:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
potentially be local we haven't done any
 
05:59:22.400 --> 05:59:23.830 align:start position:0%
potentially be local we haven't done any
specific

05:59:23.830 --> 05:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
specific
 
05:59:26.868 --> 05:59:26.878 align:start position:0%

representative

05:59:28.548 --> 05:59:28.558 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:59:30.230 --> 05:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
let me go to representative stapleton
 
05:59:30.240 --> 05:59:31.110 align:start position:0%
let me go to representative stapleton
please

05:59:31.110 --> 05:59:31.120 align:start position:0%
please
 
05:59:32.070 --> 05:59:32.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:59:33.430 --> 05:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
05:59:35.270 --> 05:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:59:38.628 --> 05:59:38.638 align:start position:0%
um i heard we heard testimony previously
 
05:59:40.230 --> 05:59:40.240 align:start position:0%
that the department
 
05:59:41.990 --> 05:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
is comfortable with the language in this
 
05:59:42.000 --> 05:59:42.868 align:start position:0%
is comfortable with the language in this
bill

05:59:42.868 --> 05:59:42.878 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:59:44.708 --> 05:59:44.718 align:start position:0%
so my question is
 
05:59:47.750 --> 05:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
have you spent a great deal of time
 
05:59:49.990 --> 05:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
investigating the
 
05:59:52.150 --> 05:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
various other states
 
05:59:54.390 --> 05:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
that have implemented legislation
 
05:59:54.400 --> 05:59:55.750 align:start position:0%
that have implemented legislation
similarly

05:59:55.750 --> 05:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
similarly
 
05:59:57.750 --> 05:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
and are there differences that you
 
06:00:00.390 --> 06:00:00.400 align:start position:0%
picked out to
 
06:00:04.868 --> 06:00:04.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:06.868 --> 06:00:06.878 align:start position:0%
thank you we we have not studied the
 
06:00:09.270 --> 06:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
other states in detail um i know that on
 
06:00:11.430 --> 06:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
the air side todd and others in the air
 
06:00:13.990 --> 06:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
division have looked at this ongoing
 
06:00:16.310 --> 06:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
topic for its last several years with
 
06:00:18.470 --> 06:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
epa but as far as other states that have
 
06:00:19.990 --> 06:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
implemented this or the other states
 
06:00:21.510 --> 06:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
that have facilities
 
06:00:23.830 --> 06:00:23.840 align:start position:0%
no we've not investigated that
 
06:00:26.310 --> 06:00:26.320 align:start position:0%
our support for this bill really lies in
 
06:00:29.030 --> 06:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
the the idea that um
 
06:00:31.270 --> 06:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
we believe that you know we hear from
 
06:00:32.628 --> 06:00:32.638 align:start position:0%
our stakeholders we hear from the
 
06:00:32.638 --> 06:00:33.990 align:start position:0%
our stakeholders we hear from the
legislature

06:00:33.990 --> 06:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
06:00:35.990 --> 06:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
that there is a very strong desire to
 
06:00:38.230 --> 06:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
reduce the amount of materials that go
 
06:00:40.390 --> 06:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
into landfills or to incinerators for
 
06:00:40.400 --> 06:00:41.750 align:start position:0%
into landfills or to incinerators for
disposal

06:00:41.750 --> 06:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
disposal
 
06:00:42.868 --> 06:00:42.878 align:start position:0%
and to
 
06:00:46.390 --> 06:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
recycle much more particularly plastics
 
06:00:49.350 --> 06:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
than we currently do and we see this as
 
06:00:51.590 --> 06:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
an opportunity whether a facility would
 
06:00:53.350 --> 06:00:53.360 align:start position:0%
be cited here in new hampshire or
 
06:00:55.670 --> 06:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in the region we see advanced
 
06:00:57.910 --> 06:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
recycling as a potential for
 
06:01:00.548 --> 06:01:00.558 align:start position:0%
significantly increasing that diversion
 
06:01:02.150 --> 06:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
rate of plastics
 
06:01:06.150 --> 06:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
and as we viewed it the acc and the
 
06:01:08.708 --> 06:01:08.718 align:start position:0%
sponsors came to us early in the fall
 
06:01:10.390 --> 06:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
we identified with their original bill
 
06:01:12.708 --> 06:01:12.718 align:start position:0%
about five or six concerns
 
06:01:14.788 --> 06:01:14.798 align:start position:0%
they addressed all of those concerns
 
06:01:17.510 --> 06:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
except for one when we got to the first
 
06:01:19.030 --> 06:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
hearing in the senate
 
06:01:21.510 --> 06:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
and it became evident from my testimony
 
06:01:23.030 --> 06:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
in the senate that we still had not
 
06:01:25.670 --> 06:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
reconciled that one issue that issue was
 
06:01:25.680 --> 06:01:26.868 align:start position:0%
reconciled that one issue that issue was
surrounding

06:01:26.868 --> 06:01:26.878 align:start position:0%
surrounding
 
06:01:28.628 --> 06:01:28.638 align:start position:0%
again is a very practical consideration
 
06:01:30.150 --> 06:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
for me because as a director of the
 
06:01:32.390 --> 06:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
waste division and solid waste is part
 
06:01:34.948 --> 06:01:34.958 align:start position:0%
of my the purview of my division we do
 
06:01:36.868 --> 06:01:36.878 align:start position:0%
occasionally get people managing solid
 
06:01:38.708 --> 06:01:38.718 align:start position:0%
waste or storing it in a way that
 
06:01:40.868 --> 06:01:40.878 align:start position:0%
creates some kind of at the very least a
 
06:01:42.628 --> 06:01:42.638 align:start position:0%
nuisance so you know if you've got
 
06:01:44.628 --> 06:01:44.638 align:start position:0%
plastics they may have food residues or
 
06:01:47.190 --> 06:01:47.200 align:start position:0%
other organics associated with them um
 
06:01:51.110 --> 06:01:51.120 align:start position:0%
that um that can attract bugs or rats or
 
06:01:53.750 --> 06:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
seagulls or you name your favorite pests
 
06:01:55.590 --> 06:01:55.600 align:start position:0%
and if they're not managed properly
 
06:01:57.350 --> 06:01:57.360 align:start position:0%
those things can create a nuisance or a
 
06:01:59.190 --> 06:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
public health or environmental threat
 
06:02:01.190 --> 06:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
and my concern with the original version
 
06:02:04.230 --> 06:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
of the bill was that if we if we if the
 
06:02:06.150 --> 06:02:06.160 align:start position:0%
bill were to pass and those
 
06:02:07.830 --> 06:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
plastics that were being stored at an
 
06:02:12.150 --> 06:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
advanced recycling facility were not
 
06:02:14.150 --> 06:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
subject to solid waste law
 
06:02:15.750 --> 06:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
we would not have authority we often
 
06:02:17.190 --> 06:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
have a health officer call us and say
 
06:02:18.708 --> 06:02:18.718 align:start position:0%
hey this guy's storing waste in a way
 
06:02:19.990 --> 06:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
that's creating a rat problem or
 
06:02:20.000 --> 06:02:20.868 align:start position:0%
that's creating a rat problem or
whatever

06:02:20.868 --> 06:02:20.878 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
06:02:20.878 --> 06:02:21.590 align:start position:0%
whatever
and

06:02:21.590 --> 06:02:21.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:02:23.110 --> 06:02:23.120 align:start position:0%
normally we can use our authority under
 
06:02:25.110 --> 06:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
the solid waste statute to address that
 
06:02:26.390 --> 06:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
and i was concerned that with the
 
06:02:27.750 --> 06:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
original draft of the bill we wouldn't
 
06:02:29.990 --> 06:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
have that authority and i articulated
 
06:02:31.510 --> 06:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
that to the committee and then we worked
 
06:02:34.310 --> 06:02:34.320 align:start position:0%
back with the acc and the bill sponsors
 
06:02:35.910 --> 06:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
and eventually arrived at an amendment
 
06:02:37.510 --> 06:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
that's contained in the current amended
 
06:02:38.868 --> 06:02:38.878 align:start position:0%
version of the bill
 
06:02:41.270 --> 06:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
that basically says with respect to
 
06:02:42.868 --> 06:02:42.878 align:start position:0%
storage of these materials at the
 
06:02:45.030 --> 06:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
facility prior to them entering the
 
06:02:47.510 --> 06:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
recycling you know the the processing
 
06:02:47.520 --> 06:02:49.670 align:start position:0%
recycling you know the the processing
process

06:02:49.670 --> 06:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
process
 
06:02:51.510 --> 06:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
we still retain our authority to enter
 
06:02:53.590 --> 06:02:53.600 align:start position:0%
and inspect the facility to determine
 
06:02:55.270 --> 06:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
whether that storage is creating any
 
06:02:56.948 --> 06:02:56.958 align:start position:0%
kind of a nuisance or environmental
 
06:02:59.350 --> 06:02:59.360 align:start position:0%
health threat um and then to use our
 
06:03:01.910 --> 06:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
authority under 149 m to address that if
 
06:03:04.310 --> 06:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
we find such a threat so
 
06:03:07.350 --> 06:03:07.360 align:start position:0%
with that provision entered into it the
 
06:03:07.360 --> 06:03:08.948 align:start position:0%
with that provision entered into it the
agency

06:03:08.948 --> 06:03:08.958 align:start position:0%
agency
 
06:03:10.948 --> 06:03:10.958 align:start position:0%
no longer had opposition to the bill and
 
06:03:13.670 --> 06:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
we and we elected to support the bill
 
06:03:15.030 --> 06:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
so that's the one maybe more than you
 
06:03:16.390 --> 06:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
wanted but that's the story of the bill
 
06:03:19.190 --> 06:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:20.868 --> 06:03:20.878 align:start position:0%
representative bixby and then i have a
 
06:03:23.510 --> 06:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
question myself yeah i have a um a
 
06:03:26.548 --> 06:03:26.558 align:start position:0%
couple of related questions which uh we
 
06:03:28.868 --> 06:03:28.878 align:start position:0%
weren't able to get answered last week
 
06:03:32.948 --> 06:03:32.958 align:start position:0%
by anyone who was here so um
 
06:03:35.030 --> 06:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
why does the current classification of
 
06:03:36.868 --> 06:03:36.878 align:start position:0%
recycling as solid waste create an
 
06:03:40.390 --> 06:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
impediment for advanced recycling
 
06:03:40.400 --> 06:03:41.270 align:start position:0%
impediment for advanced recycling
well

06:03:41.270 --> 06:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:03:43.830 --> 06:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
that's a good question i i you know one
 
06:03:45.270 --> 06:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
one of those i'll be very candid with
 
06:03:46.948 --> 06:03:46.958 align:start position:0%
you one of the discussions we had when
 
06:03:49.270 --> 06:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
we first started talking with acc and
 
06:03:50.708 --> 06:03:50.718 align:start position:0%
the bill sponsor
 
06:03:52.230 --> 06:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
about this was
 
06:03:54.788 --> 06:03:54.798 align:start position:0%
what is the problem and my i i don't
 
06:03:56.628 --> 06:03:56.638 align:start position:0%
know i i think you'd have to ask them i
 
06:03:58.390 --> 06:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
mean i think it it would still be
 
06:03:59.990 --> 06:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
possible to cite and operate
 
06:04:02.070 --> 06:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
successfully an advanced recycling
 
06:04:04.150 --> 06:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
facility in new hampshire under the
 
06:04:06.150 --> 06:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
current regulatory scheme
 
06:04:08.390 --> 06:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
there may be aspects of that scheme that
 
06:04:10.470 --> 06:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
are make it uncomfortable maybe it's a
 
06:04:12.548 --> 06:04:12.558 align:start position:0%
stigma i don't know
 
06:04:15.030 --> 06:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
the way that the rules work right now
 
06:04:17.830 --> 06:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
any products that might be manufactured
 
06:04:19.190 --> 06:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
from so let's say that an advanced
 
06:04:22.230 --> 06:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
recycling facility is cited here under
 
06:04:23.750 --> 06:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
the current regulatory scheme without
 
06:04:25.350 --> 06:04:25.360 align:start position:0%
this bill passing
 
06:04:27.430 --> 06:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
and um they take in
 
06:04:28.548 --> 06:04:28.558 align:start position:0%
i don't know let's just sure it's always
 
06:04:30.470 --> 06:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
teachers to talk about actual examples
 
06:04:32.470 --> 06:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
they say they take in agricultural
 
06:04:34.310 --> 06:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
plastics which is really an area where
 
06:04:35.910 --> 06:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
we want to see some benefit because most
 
06:04:37.830 --> 06:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
of that now goes to disposal in
 
06:04:40.310 --> 06:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
landfills which is a shame it's a lot of
 
06:04:42.708 --> 06:04:42.718 align:start position:0%
resource going to waste
 
06:04:44.230 --> 06:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
and let's say they take in a lot of that
 
06:04:45.750 --> 06:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
material and they they break it down
 
06:04:47.350 --> 06:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
into its monomers and they make a new
 
06:04:47.360 --> 06:04:48.548 align:start position:0%
into its monomers and they make a new
plastic

06:04:48.548 --> 06:04:48.558 align:start position:0%
plastic
 
06:04:50.230 --> 06:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
and for sale maybe it's i don't i don't
 
06:04:51.430 --> 06:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
know what they can do this maybe they
 
06:04:53.190 --> 06:04:53.200 align:start position:0%
make a new agricultural plastic that's
 
06:04:55.350 --> 06:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
gonna go right back to the same use
 
06:04:57.270 --> 06:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
under the current rules that would be
 
06:04:59.030 --> 06:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
considered what's called a certified
 
06:05:00.868 --> 06:05:00.878 align:start position:0%
waste dry product they would have to get
 
06:05:03.670 --> 06:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
a certification from the agency that
 
06:05:05.510 --> 06:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
that you know basically they would have
 
06:05:07.350 --> 06:05:07.360 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it met that that that
 
06:05:07.360 --> 06:05:08.548 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it met that that that
definition

06:05:08.548 --> 06:05:08.558 align:start position:0%
definition
 
06:05:10.628 --> 06:05:10.638 align:start position:0%
um we looked at this and we don't think
 
06:05:12.150 --> 06:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
that actually adds any particular
 
06:05:13.910 --> 06:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
protections or value
 
06:05:15.670 --> 06:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
and so that's why we were comfortable
 
06:05:17.910 --> 06:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
saying okay if this bill were to pass
 
06:05:19.670 --> 06:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
and you operated a facility like that
 
06:05:20.708 --> 06:05:20.718 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't have to get that
 
06:05:22.310 --> 06:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
certification you could just make your
 
06:05:24.948 --> 06:05:24.958 align:start position:0%
product and and market it
 
06:05:27.190 --> 06:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
um and that may be again that's
 
06:05:28.628 --> 06:05:28.638 align:start position:0%
conjecture on my part because i'm not
 
06:05:30.070 --> 06:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
trying to cite an advanced recycling
 
06:05:32.470 --> 06:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
facility but um that may be that that
 
06:05:34.948 --> 06:05:34.958 align:start position:0%
kind of requirement is unattractive to
 
06:05:36.390 --> 06:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
the folks who are trying to operate
 
06:05:38.230 --> 06:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
these facilities so i think that
 
06:05:40.230 --> 06:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
question is probably better directed to
 
06:05:42.470 --> 06:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
to acc than it is to me you actually
 
06:05:46.390 --> 06:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
that was a very helpful answer um
 
06:05:48.070 --> 06:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
06:05:52.830 --> 06:05:52.840 align:start position:0%
the so another question i have is and
 
06:05:56.390 --> 06:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh would classifying
 
06:05:59.910 --> 06:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
the plastic going in as feedstock as
 
06:06:01.910 --> 06:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
not solid waste
 
06:06:01.920 --> 06:06:02.708 align:start position:0%
not solid waste
have

06:06:02.708 --> 06:06:02.718 align:start position:0%
have
 
06:06:02.718 --> 06:06:03.750 align:start position:0%
have
a

06:06:03.750 --> 06:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:06:06.070 --> 06:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
would that impact the way that we count
 
06:06:08.788 --> 06:06:08.798 align:start position:0%
our plastic diversion goals in the solid
 
06:06:10.150 --> 06:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
waste plan
 
06:06:11.910 --> 06:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh yeah that that's a great question and
 
06:06:13.510 --> 06:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
i think the answer is both yes and no
 
06:06:15.670 --> 06:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
depending on the circumstances so if you
 
06:06:16.788 --> 06:06:16.798 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
06:06:18.070 --> 06:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
and again just listening to the
 
06:06:20.230 --> 06:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
conversation with the other witnesses
 
06:06:22.070 --> 06:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
let's say that we get to a point where
 
06:06:22.080 --> 06:06:23.190 align:start position:0%
let's say that we get to a point where
um

06:06:23.190 --> 06:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:06:25.670 --> 06:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh typical waste that you and i generate
 
06:06:28.548 --> 06:06:28.558 align:start position:0%
a you know a granola bar wrapper or a or
 
06:06:29.990 --> 06:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
a beef jerky wrapper or something like
 
06:06:31.190 --> 06:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
that which we normally throw in the
 
06:06:32.310 --> 06:06:32.320 align:start position:0%
trash right now and it goes to a
 
06:06:34.788 --> 06:06:34.798 align:start position:0%
landfill um if that's
 
06:06:37.270 --> 06:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
in in a new environment with an advanced
 
06:06:39.910 --> 06:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
recycling facility in the region became
 
06:06:41.590 --> 06:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
those kinds of plastic
 
06:06:43.350 --> 06:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
an additional group of plastics became
 
06:06:45.590 --> 06:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
recyclable and we got to a point where
 
06:06:47.190 --> 06:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
you could put those in addition to your
 
06:06:49.590 --> 06:06:49.600 align:start position:0%
ones and twos you could put threes fours
 
06:06:52.070 --> 06:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
and fives in your recycling bin
 
06:06:54.070 --> 06:06:54.080 align:start position:0%
and that went to a murph a materials
 
06:06:55.750 --> 06:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
recovery facility to be separated and
 
06:06:58.070 --> 06:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
then eventually that fraction found its
 
06:07:00.788 --> 06:07:00.798 align:start position:0%
way to an advanced recycling facility
 
06:07:02.948 --> 06:07:02.958 align:start position:0%
then yes it would be counted because
 
06:07:05.110 --> 06:07:05.120 align:start position:0%
the way that we collect data we would
 
06:07:06.868 --> 06:07:06.878 align:start position:0%
know that um
 
06:07:09.110 --> 06:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
06:07:10.948 --> 06:07:10.958 align:start position:0%
transfer stations that collected that or
 
06:07:12.868 --> 06:07:12.878 align:start position:0%
the or the haulers that collected that
 
06:07:14.868 --> 06:07:14.878 align:start position:0%
would report that they sent x tons to
 
06:07:17.910 --> 06:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
that materials recovery facility and if
 
06:07:20.070 --> 06:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
and and so basically we would know that
 
06:07:22.868 --> 06:07:22.878 align:start position:0%
that essentially was was diverted from
 
06:07:25.510 --> 06:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
disposal that's where you get to a yes
 
06:07:27.270 --> 06:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
where you might get to a no is let's say
 
06:07:28.708 --> 06:07:28.718 align:start position:0%
there's a farmer it's the things that we
 
06:07:30.628 --> 06:07:30.638 align:start position:0%
don't know about right let's say there's
 
06:07:32.470 --> 06:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
a farmer in the upper valley
 
06:07:33.830 --> 06:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
who generates
 
06:07:36.310 --> 06:07:36.320 align:start position:0%
three roll-offs every spring or every
 
06:07:38.868 --> 06:07:38.878 align:start position:0%
fall whatever of of agricultural
 
06:07:41.510 --> 06:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
plastics that he used to to store his
 
06:07:43.750 --> 06:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
hay bales or his hay you know
 
06:07:43.760 --> 06:07:44.948 align:start position:0%
hay bales or his hay you know
um

06:07:44.948 --> 06:07:44.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:07:47.590 --> 06:07:47.600 align:start position:0%
then he might just ship those if if
 
06:07:49.110 --> 06:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
there were a facility like this he might
 
06:07:51.110 --> 06:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
ship those roll offs of plastic directly
 
06:07:51.120 --> 06:07:51.910 align:start position:0%
ship those roll offs of plastic directly
there

06:07:51.910 --> 06:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
there
 
06:07:53.190 --> 06:07:53.200 align:start position:0%
we don't really have any way of
 
06:07:54.948 --> 06:07:54.958 align:start position:0%
collecting that information we don't
 
06:07:57.110 --> 06:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
he's not uh he's not a solid waste
 
06:07:58.310 --> 06:07:58.320 align:start position:0%
facility he's going directly to an
 
06:08:00.788 --> 06:08:00.798 align:start position:0%
advanced recycling facility um we
 
06:08:02.470 --> 06:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily know that so i
 
06:08:03.430 --> 06:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
think they're
 
06:08:04.390 --> 06:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:08:06.788 --> 06:08:06.798 align:start position:0%
but but i would hasten to add that we
 
06:08:08.948 --> 06:08:08.958 align:start position:0%
don't know that now either
 
06:08:11.830 --> 06:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
so if there is a farmer who has found an
 
06:08:15.350 --> 06:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
outlet for his agricultural plastic
 
06:08:16.708 --> 06:08:16.718 align:start position:0%
we don't hear about it we don't know
 
06:08:19.830 --> 06:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
about it so we may want to con consider
 
06:08:21.510 --> 06:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
putting something into the bill that
 
06:08:21.520 --> 06:08:22.390 align:start position:0%
putting something into the bill that
would

06:08:22.390 --> 06:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
would
 
06:08:22.400 --> 06:08:23.270 align:start position:0%
would
um

06:08:23.270 --> 06:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:08:25.590 --> 06:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
make that would help us count that sort
 
06:08:26.948 --> 06:08:26.958 align:start position:0%
of thing
 
06:08:28.868 --> 06:08:28.878 align:start position:0%
to make sure that make sure that
 
06:08:31.350 --> 06:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
plastics that end up at these facilities
 
06:08:33.670 --> 06:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
do in fact get uh counted towards the
 
06:08:35.350 --> 06:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
diversion goals
 
06:08:37.350 --> 06:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
uh with respect there there may be a
 
06:08:39.510 --> 06:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
legislative way to do that i'm not sure
 
06:08:41.350 --> 06:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish it with this bill i
 
06:08:42.788 --> 06:08:42.798 align:start position:0%
i i think that would take some
 
06:08:44.470 --> 06:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
consideration to try to figure that that
 
06:08:46.548 --> 06:08:46.558 align:start position:0%
is not there's perhaps a more complex
 
06:08:48.548 --> 06:08:48.558 align:start position:0%
question than it sounds like okay thank
 
06:08:48.558 --> 06:08:50.390 align:start position:0%
question than it sounds like okay thank
you

06:08:50.390 --> 06:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:08:50.400 --> 06:08:51.190 align:start position:0%
you
uh

06:08:51.190 --> 06:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:08:53.030 --> 06:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
yep i'll i'll get to you it's may i ask
 
06:08:54.830 --> 06:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
a question right yep
 
06:08:57.830 --> 06:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh could i just follow up
 
06:09:00.230 --> 06:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
on that lasting question and answer just
 
06:09:01.990 --> 06:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
just a quick i just wanted to point out
 
06:09:04.310 --> 06:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
that from based on what i heard today
 
06:09:05.990 --> 06:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
that not only are there benefits on the
 
06:09:07.910 --> 06:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
front end of diverting
 
06:09:09.590 --> 06:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
plastics and so on
 
06:09:09.600 --> 06:09:10.708 align:start position:0%
plastics and so on
but

06:09:10.708 --> 06:09:10.718 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:09:12.230 --> 06:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
on the back end
 
06:09:14.390 --> 06:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
if i what i heard is correct that there
 
06:09:16.070 --> 06:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
would be a usable product that is made
 
06:09:18.150 --> 06:09:18.160 align:start position:0%
that would replace
 
06:09:20.548 --> 06:09:20.558 align:start position:0%
potentially new product
 
06:09:22.390 --> 06:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
um you know for instance they would they
 
06:09:23.350 --> 06:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
would make
 
06:09:26.470 --> 06:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
some type of of plastic feedstock
 
06:09:28.548 --> 06:09:28.558 align:start position:0%
that would go to go to a plastics
 
06:09:31.750 --> 06:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
facility and would replace the need for
 
06:09:31.760 --> 06:09:32.788 align:start position:0%
facility and would replace the need for
new

06:09:32.788 --> 06:09:32.798 align:start position:0%
new
 
06:09:35.590 --> 06:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
petroleum-based plastic feedstocks
 
06:09:35.600 --> 06:09:36.390 align:start position:0%
petroleum-based plastic feedstocks
so

06:09:36.390 --> 06:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:09:38.310 --> 06:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
i think i think there's there's two and
 
06:09:39.910 --> 06:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
two wins of this just
 
06:09:41.190 --> 06:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
that ought to be
 
06:09:47.350 --> 06:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:49.830 --> 06:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
but as as you um
 
06:09:51.830 --> 06:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
as you probably are aware this is a
 
06:09:53.910 --> 06:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
fairly complicated
 
06:09:58.070 --> 06:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
process and there is a lot of regulatory
 
06:09:59.350 --> 06:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of regulatory
 
06:10:01.430 --> 06:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
implications there are a lot there are
 
06:10:04.150 --> 06:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
certain number of safety implications
 
06:10:05.510 --> 06:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
there it's
 
06:10:07.590 --> 06:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
there is there are aspects of it are
 
06:10:10.470 --> 06:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
very attractive but we don't want to do
 
06:10:13.750 --> 06:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
um a partial job of
 
06:10:16.868 --> 06:10:16.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:19.990 --> 06:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you so i have i have two questions
 
06:10:21.830 --> 06:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
and one may be directed to you and one
 
06:10:23.670 --> 06:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
may be to the acc so let's start with
 
06:10:24.548 --> 06:10:24.558 align:start position:0%
the one
 
06:10:25.830 --> 06:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
let me ask them both to you and if you
 
06:10:27.910 --> 06:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
feel like one is germane to you then
 
06:10:29.110 --> 06:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
that's fine
 
06:10:29.120 --> 06:10:30.150 align:start position:0%
that's fine
um

06:10:30.150 --> 06:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:10:31.990 --> 06:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
going back to your conversation about
 
06:10:34.548 --> 06:10:34.558 align:start position:0%
how items are stored at the facility and
 
06:10:36.150 --> 06:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
in the event that they are stored in the
 
06:10:37.750 --> 06:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
open air
 
06:10:37.760 --> 06:10:38.628 align:start position:0%
open air
and

06:10:38.628 --> 06:10:38.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:10:41.350 --> 06:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
they are open to the elements they're
 
06:10:43.190 --> 06:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
exposed to the sun degree plastic
 
06:10:45.350 --> 06:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
degradation is the thing water runoff
 
06:10:47.270 --> 06:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
those types of things
 
06:10:49.670 --> 06:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
what type of mechanism within the bill
 
06:10:51.510 --> 06:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
do you have to ensure
 
06:10:53.670 --> 06:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
that there isn't going to be runoff or
 
06:10:56.150 --> 06:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
degraded plastic sitting out in the open
 
06:10:56.160 --> 06:10:57.270 align:start position:0%
degraded plastic sitting out in the open
somewhere

06:10:57.270 --> 06:10:57.280 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
06:10:59.830 --> 06:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
that could potentially pose a threat to
 
06:11:06.548 --> 06:11:06.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:09.190 --> 06:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
i think that the the the provision of
 
06:11:10.788 --> 06:11:10.798 align:start position:0%
the bill that was amended it does give
 
06:11:13.270 --> 06:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
us the authority to enter inspect and if
 
06:11:14.788 --> 06:11:14.798 align:start position:0%
we identify either a nuisance or an
 
06:11:16.868 --> 06:11:16.878 align:start position:0%
environmental threat we can act to
 
06:11:18.310 --> 06:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
address that
 
06:11:20.708 --> 06:11:20.718 align:start position:0%
so i think that it probably makes it
 
06:11:22.070 --> 06:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
equivalent to
 
06:11:24.070 --> 06:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
the authority we have now to address
 
06:11:25.350 --> 06:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
that question
 
06:11:28.708 --> 06:11:28.718 align:start position:0%
at a at one of these facilities under
 
06:11:31.270 --> 06:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
the current um
 
06:11:34.150 --> 06:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
of the current uh regulatory scheme
 
06:11:36.150 --> 06:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
so i guess and and to follow up if i may
 
06:11:37.590 --> 06:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
would you have
 
06:11:39.350 --> 06:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
more or less of a concern with items
 
06:11:41.270 --> 06:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
that are stored outdoor versus indoor
 
06:11:44.230 --> 06:11:44.240 align:start position:0%
and an enclosed unit
 
06:11:47.110 --> 06:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
well certainly indoor is always is
 
06:11:48.868 --> 06:11:48.878 align:start position:0%
almost unless it's a hazardous material
 
06:11:51.190 --> 06:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
that is unsafe to store indoors indoors
 
06:11:52.470 --> 06:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
almost always better for storing
 
06:11:54.470 --> 06:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
materials because you eliminate
 
06:11:56.708 --> 06:11:56.718 align:start position:0%
all the weather issues and the and run
 
06:11:58.708 --> 06:11:58.718 align:start position:0%
you know rain and precipitation and all
 
06:11:58.718 --> 06:12:00.310 align:start position:0%
you know rain and precipitation and all
that

06:12:00.310 --> 06:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:12:01.270 --> 06:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:12:02.788 --> 06:12:02.798 align:start position:0%
and i guess then the other question that
 
06:12:05.510 --> 06:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
i do have is that uh you had mentioned
 
06:12:07.750 --> 06:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
that there was a change in scope in in
 
06:12:10.150 --> 06:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
an applicant i believe that had desired
 
06:12:13.190 --> 06:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
to go from one industry to another
 
06:12:14.708 --> 06:12:14.718 align:start position:0%
does that require them to start the
 
06:12:16.628 --> 06:12:16.638 align:start position:0%
process over or amend their scope or how
 
06:12:20.628 --> 06:12:20.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:22.708 --> 06:12:22.718 align:start position:0%
no no our
 
06:12:24.948 --> 06:12:24.958 align:start position:0%
our permitting process what
 
06:12:26.788 --> 06:12:26.798 align:start position:0%
occurs is as i mentioned the facility
 
06:12:29.110 --> 06:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
would sit down with us they would
 
06:12:30.788 --> 06:12:30.798 align:start position:0%
provide all of the information they
 
06:12:32.390 --> 06:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
would fill out an application for a
 
06:12:34.150 --> 06:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
permit if we determined that they were
 
06:12:35.910 --> 06:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
subjected to that required to those
 
06:12:35.920 --> 06:12:38.310 align:start position:0%
subjected to that required to those
requirements

06:12:38.310 --> 06:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
06:12:40.868 --> 06:12:40.878 align:start position:0%
in this case the facility
 
06:12:42.628 --> 06:12:42.638 align:start position:0%
indicated to us initially that they
 
06:12:45.030 --> 06:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
planned to take the product that they
 
06:12:47.030 --> 06:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
were producing the liquid product they
 
06:12:49.190 --> 06:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
were producing and use that as a fuel
 
06:12:52.070 --> 06:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
for the generator
 
06:12:54.230 --> 06:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
during the permitting process before we
 
06:12:56.230 --> 06:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
ultimately issued the final we made a
 
06:12:58.230 --> 06:12:58.240 align:start position:0%
determination that the process itself
 
06:12:59.750 --> 06:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
was not subject to permitting that it
 
06:13:01.590 --> 06:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
was closed loop and
 
06:13:03.110 --> 06:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
and but
 
06:13:03.120 --> 06:13:04.150 align:start position:0%
and but
then

06:13:04.150 --> 06:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
then
 
06:13:07.830 --> 06:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh you know generators uh
 
06:13:10.628 --> 06:13:10.638 align:start position:0%
emergency generators or general electric
 
06:13:12.868 --> 06:13:12.878 align:start position:0%
generators at facilities are subject to
 
06:13:15.030 --> 06:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
our regulations they combust fuel and
 
06:13:16.548 --> 06:13:16.558 align:start position:0%
there's and there's air emissions with
 
06:13:18.150 --> 06:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
those so if they're of a certain size
 
06:13:21.590 --> 06:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
they're subject to our regulations
 
06:13:23.990 --> 06:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
we the original application information
 
06:13:25.830 --> 06:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
or the original discussions as i
 
06:13:27.110 --> 06:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
06:13:29.430 --> 06:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
were that they intended to use that fuel
 
06:13:31.350 --> 06:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
they subsequently came to us and amended
 
06:13:32.788 --> 06:13:32.798 align:start position:0%
that and said no
 
06:13:35.430 --> 06:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
we intend to just use diesel fuel which
 
06:13:37.430 --> 06:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
radically simplified the
 
06:13:39.350 --> 06:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
process for for issuing a permit for the
 
06:13:40.868 --> 06:13:40.878 align:start position:0%
generator and but no permit was
 
06:13:42.708 --> 06:13:42.718 align:start position:0%
necessary for the process
 
06:13:46.548 --> 06:13:46.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:48.070 --> 06:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
representative stapleton thank you so
 
06:13:49.430 --> 06:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
much for your patience
 
06:13:52.310 --> 06:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for um
 
06:13:54.708 --> 06:13:54.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for my take my question um
 
06:13:57.270 --> 06:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
that was an interesting example that you
 
06:14:00.070 --> 06:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
made with the farmer with a volume of
 
06:14:02.070 --> 06:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
roll-off plastic and
 
06:14:04.150 --> 06:14:04.160 align:start position:0%
he packs it into a truck at the end of
 
06:14:06.070 --> 06:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
the year and then sends it to a plant
 
06:14:07.110 --> 06:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
for re
 
06:14:09.830 --> 06:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
cycling or reprocessing i mean that's a
 
06:14:11.270 --> 06:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
clean example
 
06:14:13.430 --> 06:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh there would be no reason for a
 
06:14:13.440 --> 06:14:14.548 align:start position:0%
uh there would be no reason for a
landfill

06:14:14.548 --> 06:14:14.558 align:start position:0%
landfill
 
06:14:16.708 --> 06:14:16.718 align:start position:0%
permit regarding that because it's a
 
06:14:18.868 --> 06:14:18.878 align:start position:0%
direct from
 
06:14:23.110 --> 06:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:26.948 --> 06:14:26.958 align:start position:0%
i was at the landfill transfer station
 
06:14:30.310 --> 06:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
in claremont not long ago and
 
06:14:32.788 --> 06:14:32.798 align:start position:0%
wondered all of these plastics that come
 
06:14:34.868 --> 06:14:34.878 align:start position:0%
from food containers
 
06:14:36.628 --> 06:14:36.638 align:start position:0%
all different types
 
06:14:39.350 --> 06:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
and i asked the transfer
 
06:14:39.360 --> 06:14:40.390 align:start position:0%
and i asked the transfer
person

06:14:40.390 --> 06:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
person
 
06:14:42.230 --> 06:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
you know what happens to these things
 
06:14:44.470 --> 06:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
and he pointed out that these pla
 
06:14:47.750 --> 06:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturers are putting plastic codes
 
06:14:49.750 --> 06:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
type of plastic codes
 
06:14:52.470 --> 06:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
on these various containers
 
06:14:54.150 --> 06:14:54.160 align:start position:0%
so if you have
 
06:14:56.868 --> 06:14:56.878 align:start position:0%
a consolidator or aggregator they can
 
06:14:59.190 --> 06:14:59.200 align:start position:0%
separate these things out and into
 
06:15:01.670 --> 06:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
different categories of plastics and
 
06:15:03.590 --> 06:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
make a bulk volume
 
06:15:03.600 --> 06:15:04.470 align:start position:0%
make a bulk volume
that

06:15:04.470 --> 06:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:15:07.670 --> 06:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
this industry could buy for processing
 
06:15:10.470 --> 06:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
in which case it never goes into the
 
06:15:10.480 --> 06:15:11.750 align:start position:0%
in which case it never goes into the
landfill

06:15:11.750 --> 06:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
landfill
 
06:15:14.150 --> 06:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
that's what we're looking at here so why
 
06:15:16.548 --> 06:15:16.558 align:start position:0%
would we give a landfill permit
 
06:15:19.270 --> 06:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
to a a material that's never going to go
 
06:15:21.830 --> 06:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
into the landfill that that's the way i
 
06:15:24.628 --> 06:15:24.638 align:start position:0%
see it and that's the question
 
06:15:26.708 --> 06:15:26.718 align:start position:0%
why should we have to
 
06:15:29.430 --> 06:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
you know run run through landfill
 
06:15:32.628 --> 06:15:32.638 align:start position:0%
permits and considerations if it's only
 
06:15:34.788 --> 06:15:34.798 align:start position:0%
going to go to processing like scrap
 
06:15:34.798 --> 06:15:36.548 align:start position:0%
going to go to processing like scrap
metals

06:15:36.548 --> 06:15:36.558 align:start position:0%
metals
 
06:15:37.910 --> 06:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
for instance
 
06:15:40.070 --> 06:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
yes and i agree with your analysis sorry
 
06:15:42.150 --> 06:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
i do want to clarify just just so that i
 
06:15:43.670 --> 06:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
i haven't i don't i hope i haven't
 
06:15:45.190 --> 06:15:45.200 align:start position:0%
confused anybody
 
06:15:47.110 --> 06:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
under the current regulatory scheme a
 
06:15:48.708 --> 06:15:48.718 align:start position:0%
facility that would do this kind of
 
06:15:50.948 --> 06:15:50.958 align:start position:0%
advanced recycling would not actually be
 
06:15:53.350 --> 06:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
required to get a permit they would be
 
06:15:56.310 --> 06:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
what's called a permit exempt
 
06:15:58.470 --> 06:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
solid waste processing facility so they
 
06:16:00.868 --> 06:16:00.878 align:start position:0%
really have just a basic core
 
06:16:02.548 --> 06:16:02.558 align:start position:0%
set of requirements that would apply to
 
06:16:05.270 --> 06:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
them much less than what is applied to
 
06:16:08.150 --> 06:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
to a even a transfer station or or a
 
06:16:10.628 --> 06:16:10.638 align:start position:0%
landfill or any other type of facility
 
06:16:10.638 --> 06:16:11.670 align:start position:0%
landfill or any other type of facility
um

06:16:11.670 --> 06:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:13.830 --> 06:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
but uh but i understand yeah your point
 
06:16:15.990 --> 06:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
i think is exactly right if more of you
 
06:16:16.000 --> 06:16:18.708 align:start position:0%
i think is exactly right if more of you
know

06:16:18.708 --> 06:16:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:20.310 --> 06:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
you're never as dumb as you are at home
 
06:16:21.990 --> 06:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
um nobody thinks i know anything there
 
06:16:23.750 --> 06:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
so when i tell them you can't put threes
 
06:16:26.070 --> 06:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
fours and fives and sixes in recycling
 
06:16:27.750 --> 06:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
they think i'm wrong and they say you
 
06:16:30.070 --> 06:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
don't know anything about recycling so
 
06:16:32.628 --> 06:16:32.638 align:start position:0%
communities have struggled for years
 
06:16:34.390 --> 06:16:34.400 align:start position:0%
to try to get people to put the things
 
06:16:37.190 --> 06:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
into their single stream recycling or or
 
06:16:39.430 --> 06:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
separated only the things that they
 
06:16:41.350 --> 06:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
actually recycle in that community and i
 
06:16:44.310 --> 06:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
live in concord and in concord we don't
 
06:16:46.150 --> 06:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
recycle threes fours fives and sixes
 
06:16:47.590 --> 06:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
they just they just don't have an outlet
 
06:16:49.510 --> 06:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
for it they want the ones and twos
 
06:16:51.590 --> 06:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
so the hope would be if we get to a
 
06:16:53.510 --> 06:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
future state where in the region of the
 
06:16:55.990 --> 06:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
country we have a variety of these kind
 
06:16:57.990 --> 06:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
of facilities that can handle these
 
06:16:58.000 --> 06:16:59.190 align:start position:0%
of facilities that can handle these
other

06:16:59.190 --> 06:16:59.200 align:start position:0%
other
 
06:17:01.430 --> 06:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
codes of plastics more of the plastics
 
06:17:03.110 --> 06:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
will be diverted from the disposal the
 
06:17:05.110 --> 06:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
waste stream that is traditionally now
 
06:17:07.830 --> 06:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
going to disposal
 
06:17:09.270 --> 06:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you so it's a growth
 
06:17:11.350 --> 06:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
potential or a growth industry with a
 
06:17:13.430 --> 06:17:13.440 align:start position:0%
lot of potential to alleviate this
 
06:17:17.830 --> 06:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:20.310 --> 06:17:20.320 align:start position:0%
thank you i do have another question and
 
06:17:22.788 --> 06:17:22.798 align:start position:0%
being conscientious of the time
 
06:17:26.548 --> 06:17:26.558 align:start position:0%
um uh i did have one for the acc so i
 
06:17:29.270 --> 06:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
think unless there's other questions for
 
06:17:30.628 --> 06:17:30.638 align:start position:0%
the department
 
06:17:33.190 --> 06:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
great okay thank you
 
06:17:43.030 --> 06:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:45.750 --> 06:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
thank you um so
 
06:17:47.670 --> 06:17:47.680 align:start position:0%
i i did have another question you
 
06:17:50.230 --> 06:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
earlier in your testimony had testified
 
06:17:52.948 --> 06:17:52.958 align:start position:0%
to there being less suitable plastics
 
06:17:54.868 --> 06:17:54.878 align:start position:0%
for processing such as maybe
 
06:17:57.350 --> 06:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
multi-layered chip bags or anything of
 
06:17:58.708 --> 06:17:58.718 align:start position:0%
those types of sorts right now that
 
06:17:59.990 --> 06:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
06:18:00.000 --> 06:18:00.868 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
um

06:18:00.868 --> 06:18:00.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:18:03.510 --> 06:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
at the moment but
 
06:18:05.750 --> 06:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
i guess what i i
 
06:18:07.670 --> 06:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
to director wimsat's point we are well
 
06:18:09.510 --> 06:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
aware in this committee that there are
 
06:18:11.590 --> 06:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
plastics that are suitable for recycling
 
06:18:13.190 --> 06:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
and some that are not and it even sounds
 
06:18:14.948 --> 06:18:14.958 align:start position:0%
to me that there is some debate among
 
06:18:17.350 --> 06:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
your own industry or or that those that
 
06:18:18.628 --> 06:18:18.638 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
06:18:20.230 --> 06:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
whether or not you can
 
06:18:23.190 --> 06:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
potentially use those for pyrolysis so
 
06:18:25.190 --> 06:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
could you elaborate about where you are
 
06:18:27.830 --> 06:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
right now with those specific
 
06:18:29.830 --> 06:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
types of plastic that are multi-layered
 
06:18:32.548 --> 06:18:32.558 align:start position:0%
that type of thing
 
06:18:34.230 --> 06:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
no the technologies can take
 
06:18:37.030 --> 06:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
multi-layered plastics um
 
06:18:38.708 --> 06:18:38.718 align:start position:0%
i guess i think the key thing is there's
 
06:18:40.468 --> 06:18:40.478 align:start position:0%
there's so advanced recycling is not
 
06:18:44.628 --> 06:18:44.638 align:start position:0%
sort of one monolithic um
 
06:18:46.628 --> 06:18:46.638 align:start position:0%
it's not one sort of monolithic thing
 
06:18:48.788 --> 06:18:48.798 align:start position:0%
right there are different inputs
 
06:18:51.030 --> 06:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
um depending upon the plastics that
 
06:18:52.468 --> 06:18:52.478 align:start position:0%
oftentimes are dependent upon the
 
06:18:54.070 --> 06:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
technology used so there's four
 
06:18:55.510 --> 06:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
technologies that are kind of defined in
 
06:18:57.830 --> 06:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
the bill uh
 
06:19:00.390 --> 06:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh gasification sovolysis and
 
06:19:00.400 --> 06:19:01.910 align:start position:0%
uh gasification sovolysis and
depolymerization

06:19:01.910 --> 06:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
depolymerization
 
06:19:04.150 --> 06:19:04.160 align:start position:0%
and then depending upon the input the
 
06:19:07.030 --> 06:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
process used there might be a different
 
06:19:07.040 --> 06:19:07.990 align:start position:0%
process used there might be a different
output

06:19:07.990 --> 06:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
output
 
06:19:09.990 --> 06:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
so for example
 
06:19:12.310 --> 06:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
polystyrene which folks know is
 
06:19:14.628 --> 06:19:14.638 align:start position:0%
sometimes styrofoam although that's a
 
06:19:17.030 --> 06:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
misnomer for it's actually a insulation
 
06:19:18.468 --> 06:19:18.478 align:start position:0%
it's not what you think of as your
 
06:19:20.468 --> 06:19:20.478 align:start position:0%
dunkin donuts coffee cup or you know
 
06:19:21.990 --> 06:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
your foam coolers
 
06:19:23.670 --> 06:19:23.680 align:start position:0%
through the pyrolysis process if you
 
06:19:26.468 --> 06:19:26.478 align:start position:0%
just have polystyrene you can actually
 
06:19:29.030 --> 06:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
make essentially a styrene monomer
 
06:19:30.788 --> 06:19:30.798 align:start position:0%
um that goes right back in the
 
06:19:32.788 --> 06:19:32.798 align:start position:0%
production of polystyrene and so it
 
06:19:35.110 --> 06:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
could go back into uh you know your solo
 
06:19:36.390 --> 06:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
cup which is you know you think of that
 
06:19:38.468 --> 06:19:38.478 align:start position:0%
as a drink cup or into
 
06:19:41.030 --> 06:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
um you know a
 
06:19:43.590 --> 06:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
a plastic plate or something or a bowl
 
06:19:46.230 --> 06:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
so it's it's kind of dependent upon the
 
06:19:48.468 --> 06:19:48.478 align:start position:0%
technology used the inputs and the
 
06:19:50.548 --> 06:19:50.558 align:start position:0%
process and then of course the customer
 
06:19:52.468 --> 06:19:52.478 align:start position:0%
so we have companies like america
 
06:19:56.070 --> 06:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
styrenics that has committed to a goal
 
06:19:57.270 --> 06:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
of 25
 
06:19:59.510 --> 06:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
of all the food service plastics that
 
06:20:00.788 --> 06:20:00.798 align:start position:0%
they produce
 
06:20:04.070 --> 06:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
are made from recycled content um so
 
06:20:05.990 --> 06:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
again they're a sort of a polystyrene
 
06:20:07.350 --> 06:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
producer so
 
06:20:08.310 --> 06:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that answers your
 
06:20:09.430 --> 06:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
question but
 
06:20:11.990 --> 06:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
you know i mentioned uh eastman taking
 
06:20:14.468 --> 06:20:14.478 align:start position:0%
carpet carpet is very difficult to
 
06:20:14.478 --> 06:20:15.750 align:start position:0%
carpet carpet is very difficult to
recycle

06:20:15.750 --> 06:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
recycle
 
06:20:18.070 --> 06:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
mechanically but they're taking it
 
06:20:19.190 --> 06:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
they're taking it out of places like
 
06:20:19.200 --> 06:20:20.390 align:start position:0%
they're taking it out of places like
california

06:20:20.390 --> 06:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
california
 
06:20:22.310 --> 06:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
and michigan and others and can take
 
06:20:23.830 --> 06:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
that and turn it back into you know
 
06:20:25.750 --> 06:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
again it's sort of basic molecules and
 
06:20:27.590 --> 06:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
then use it to rebuild into different
 
06:20:29.750 --> 06:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
types of products again so it'll it all
 
06:20:32.628 --> 06:20:32.638 align:start position:0%
depends but pyrolysis um for the most
 
06:20:35.270 --> 06:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
part is going to take polyethylene so
 
06:20:36.390 --> 06:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
think your
 
06:20:36.400 --> 06:20:37.350 align:start position:0%
think your
um

06:20:37.350 --> 06:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:20:39.110 --> 06:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
i think your you know
 
06:20:41.030 --> 06:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
you know your your your milk jugs your
 
06:20:42.390 --> 06:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
detergent bottles so those have good
 
06:20:43.910 --> 06:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
markets right now so they're not likely
 
06:20:46.628 --> 06:20:46.638 align:start position:0%
but we're often your film plastics so
 
06:20:48.708 --> 06:20:48.718 align:start position:0%
the film that's around toilet paper and
 
06:20:51.910 --> 06:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
paper towels um you know again snack
 
06:20:54.150 --> 06:20:54.160 align:start position:0%
pouches drink pouches your
 
06:20:56.310 --> 06:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
frozen pea bags things like that
 
06:20:58.868 --> 06:20:58.878 align:start position:0%
polypropylene which you often times find
 
06:21:00.948 --> 06:21:00.958 align:start position:0%
sometimes in like squeeze bottles you
 
06:21:02.708 --> 06:21:02.718 align:start position:0%
find it in uh sometimes in like clam
 
06:21:04.150 --> 06:21:04.160 align:start position:0%
shells that have like muffins and things
 
06:21:05.910 --> 06:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
in them you find them in deli containers
 
06:21:08.390 --> 06:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
and tubs and lids ice cream sometimes is
 
06:21:09.750 --> 06:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
packed in polypropylene and then also
 
06:21:12.230 --> 06:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
polystyrene which again you see in
 
06:21:13.910 --> 06:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
different applications as well i named a
 
06:21:13.920 --> 06:21:15.750 align:start position:0%
different applications as well i named a
few

06:21:15.750 --> 06:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
few
 
06:21:17.830 --> 06:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
representative bixby sure
 
06:21:19.990 --> 06:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um
 
06:21:20.000 --> 06:21:21.110 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um
so

06:21:21.110 --> 06:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:21:21.120 --> 06:21:22.230 align:start position:0%
so
um

06:21:22.230 --> 06:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:21:24.868 --> 06:21:24.878 align:start position:0%
in the discussion i the the term came up
 
06:21:26.868 --> 06:21:26.878 align:start position:0%
that i was kind of looking for and i
 
06:21:29.430 --> 06:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
didn't uh i hadn't like remembered it
 
06:21:31.350 --> 06:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
before but um
 
06:21:34.390 --> 06:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
the uh closed-loop pro a closed-loop
 
06:21:36.708 --> 06:21:36.718 align:start position:0%
process which is essentially a process
 
06:21:38.948 --> 06:21:38.958 align:start position:0%
where you don't have
 
06:21:41.030 --> 06:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh outputs other than you don't have
 
06:21:42.948 --> 06:21:42.958 align:start position:0%
waste output so basically you have your
 
06:21:44.830 --> 06:21:44.840 align:start position:0%
input and then
 
06:21:46.868 --> 06:21:46.878 align:start position:0%
everything uh
 
06:21:48.788 --> 06:21:48.798 align:start position:0%
yeah and then you have con essentially
 
06:21:51.190 --> 06:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
controlled output of any of everything
 
06:21:53.110 --> 06:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
that that's coming out of it
 
06:21:55.590 --> 06:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
would you are these advanced recycling
 
06:21:58.230 --> 06:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
facilities closed loop facilities or are
 
06:22:01.190 --> 06:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
there emissions and effluents that
 
06:22:04.468 --> 06:22:04.478 align:start position:0%
uh are necessarily part of the process
 
06:22:05.990 --> 06:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a good question
 
06:22:08.708 --> 06:22:08.718 align:start position:0%
so i would say i i i don't really know
 
06:22:11.910 --> 06:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
of any manufacturing process that is 100
 
06:22:14.868 --> 06:22:14.878 align:start position:0%
closed loop unless it's
 
06:22:17.030 --> 06:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
running 100 on solar energy
 
06:22:17.040 --> 06:22:17.830 align:start position:0%
running 100 on solar energy
um

06:22:17.830 --> 06:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:22:20.948 --> 06:22:20.958 align:start position:0%
and also then producing zero byproduct
 
06:22:23.350 --> 06:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
or waste um so if if
 
06:22:25.190 --> 06:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
that's happening i'd you know show me
 
06:22:25.200 --> 06:22:25.910 align:start position:0%
that's happening i'd you know show me
that

06:22:25.910 --> 06:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:22:28.390 --> 06:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
number one um so number two i i think i
 
06:22:30.628 --> 06:22:30.638 align:start position:0%
mentioned sort of that right now um
 
06:22:32.390 --> 06:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
these it's sort of an 80 10 10
 
06:22:34.070 --> 06:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
proposition which is better than what
 
06:22:35.910 --> 06:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
we're doing right now so your frozen pea
 
06:22:37.110 --> 06:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
bag your
 
06:22:39.590 --> 06:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
your your pouch of granola or beef jerky
 
06:22:42.310 --> 06:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
or you know snack mix with peanuts and m
 
06:22:43.910 --> 06:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
m's and things like that that stuff's
 
06:22:45.830 --> 06:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
going to landfill so through these
 
06:22:47.750 --> 06:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
technologies at least through pyrolysis
 
06:22:49.830 --> 06:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
you'd get about 80 percent of that back
 
06:22:52.070 --> 06:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
into a liquid feedstock that can be
 
06:22:54.708 --> 06:22:54.718 align:start position:0%
turned into new plastics again you would
 
06:22:56.788 --> 06:22:56.798 align:start position:0%
get about 10 percent of this char and as
 
06:22:58.070 --> 06:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
i mentioned they're trying to get to
 
06:22:59.510 --> 06:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
close loop because they want everything
 
06:23:01.510 --> 06:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
they produce remember it's a business so
 
06:23:03.270 --> 06:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
anything that they have to
 
06:23:05.350 --> 06:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
isn't a product that they can sell as a
 
06:23:07.910 --> 06:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
cost to them so they're are actively
 
06:23:10.070 --> 06:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
looking for markets for what you can do
 
06:23:11.190 --> 06:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
with this
 
06:23:13.030 --> 06:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
chart i mentioned sort of carbon black
 
06:23:15.110 --> 06:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
as one potentially as part of a cement
 
06:23:17.270 --> 06:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
binder as well asphalt is kind of
 
06:23:18.788 --> 06:23:18.798 align:start position:0%
another there's a lot of different sort
 
06:23:20.868 --> 06:23:20.878 align:start position:0%
of testing going on but then there is a
 
06:23:23.030 --> 06:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
10 percent of these non-condensable
 
06:23:25.670 --> 06:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
gases um if you were co-located with a
 
06:23:27.750 --> 06:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
chemical plant you could potentially use
 
06:23:29.190 --> 06:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
those gases to actually become a
 
06:23:30.788 --> 06:23:30.798 align:start position:0%
feedstock for new plastics and other
 
06:23:32.150 --> 06:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
things again here in new hampshire
 
06:23:33.590 --> 06:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
though that's probably
 
06:23:35.590 --> 06:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
unlikely so it is used as a process
 
06:23:39.030 --> 06:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
energy i think the key thing though is
 
06:23:40.948 --> 06:23:40.958 align:start position:0%
is is you got to think of this in the
 
06:23:43.430 --> 06:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
context of how much so a company called
 
06:23:45.590 --> 06:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
good company out of eugene oregon did
 
06:23:47.510 --> 06:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
some emissions modeling and there was a
 
06:23:49.030 --> 06:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
good discussion about hazardous air
 
06:23:51.030 --> 06:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
pollutants and um
 
06:23:52.788 --> 06:23:52.798 align:start position:0%
criteria air pollutants right so number
 
06:23:54.548 --> 06:23:54.558 align:start position:0%
one these facilities are well well well
 
06:23:56.788 --> 06:23:56.798 align:start position:0%
below title five thresholds that's when
 
06:23:59.830 --> 06:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
you have to go to the epa to get a um
 
06:24:01.990 --> 06:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
a permit and then number two when you
 
06:24:04.468 --> 06:24:04.478 align:start position:0%
look at the criteria air pollutants no
 
06:24:06.468 --> 06:24:06.478 align:start position:0%
different than you know
 
06:24:08.708 --> 06:24:08.718 align:start position:0%
a college or a hospital you know i mean
 
06:24:10.468 --> 06:24:10.478 align:start position:0%
so when you look at the
 
06:24:11.670 --> 06:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:24:13.590 --> 06:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
um energy needed at the university of
 
06:24:14.948 --> 06:24:14.958 align:start position:0%
new hampshire in durham or keene state
 
06:24:16.948 --> 06:24:16.958 align:start position:0%
college or you know
 
06:24:18.708 --> 06:24:18.718 align:start position:0%
dartmouth hitchcock right because they
 
06:24:19.910 --> 06:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
have a boiler to produce because they
 
06:24:21.670 --> 06:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
need you know you need heat in the cold
 
06:24:23.750 --> 06:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire winters right you need
 
06:24:26.390 --> 06:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
steam for showers and things like that
 
06:24:28.468 --> 06:24:28.478 align:start position:0%
um the emissions from these facilities
 
06:24:31.350 --> 06:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
are basically the same or lower than
 
06:24:33.990 --> 06:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
colleges and universities
 
06:24:36.150 --> 06:24:36.160 align:start position:0%
and we can provide that report as um
 
06:24:38.070 --> 06:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
serve as a follow-up too
 
06:24:41.190 --> 06:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
please please do so um so
 
06:24:43.430 --> 06:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
um is there anything in the emission
 
06:24:46.868 --> 06:24:46.878 align:start position:0%
emissions other than carbon dioxide and
 
06:24:48.468 --> 06:24:48.478 align:start position:0%
um and and
 
06:24:53.590 --> 06:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
water or is it um i i i i i'm and and
 
06:24:55.830 --> 06:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
comparing that to a hospital or to a uh
 
06:24:57.510 --> 06:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
or a particular college campus i'm
 
06:24:59.110 --> 06:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
thinking about the
 
06:25:00.868 --> 06:25:00.878 align:start position:0%
hoods in the chemistry department and
 
06:25:02.468 --> 06:25:02.478 align:start position:0%
with the acetone and stuff being
 
06:25:05.350 --> 06:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
volatilized that so there there are
 
06:25:07.030 --> 06:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
there are emissions that you might not
 
06:25:09.190 --> 06:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily be happy about
 
06:25:12.548 --> 06:25:12.558 align:start position:0%
with that even in a university or at a
 
06:25:14.830 --> 06:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
hospital uh so
 
06:25:17.030 --> 06:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
um but uh
 
06:25:17.040 --> 06:25:18.468 align:start position:0%
um but uh
so

06:25:18.468 --> 06:25:18.478 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:25:22.150 --> 06:25:22.160 align:start position:0%
uh if it if the emission are there other
 
06:25:24.548 --> 06:25:24.558 align:start position:0%
emissions besides uh
 
06:25:26.708 --> 06:25:26.718 align:start position:0%
the um
 
06:25:29.590 --> 06:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
besides just carbon dioxide and and
 
06:25:31.830 --> 06:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
water coming out of the stack yes i mean
 
06:25:33.670 --> 06:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
there's small amounts of things like you
 
06:25:36.548 --> 06:25:36.558 align:start position:0%
know hydrogen oxide right nox
 
06:25:39.350 --> 06:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
um that's a good example so again we can
 
06:25:41.830 --> 06:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
provide that information to modeled
 
06:25:43.750 --> 06:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
against hospitals universities other
 
06:25:45.910 --> 06:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturing facilities
 
06:25:45.920 --> 06:25:46.788 align:start position:0%
manufacturing facilities
so

06:25:46.788 --> 06:25:46.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:25:47.590 --> 06:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
you're not going to have you're not
 
06:25:50.070 --> 06:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
going to have zero uh emissions at sort
 
06:25:51.510 --> 06:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
of any sort of manufacturing unless
 
06:25:53.350 --> 06:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
they're 100 solar powered or wind
 
06:25:55.670 --> 06:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
powered right now right and one
 
06:25:57.350 --> 06:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
follow-up from representative bixby and
 
06:25:59.350 --> 06:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
then representative
 
06:25:59.360 --> 06:26:00.230 align:start position:0%
then representative
and

06:26:00.230 --> 06:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:26:03.190 --> 06:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
uh is there any effort to use co2
 
06:26:05.430 --> 06:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
scrubbers to reduce the
 
06:26:09.430 --> 06:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:10.468 --> 06:26:10.478 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
06:26:13.430 --> 06:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
i think number one is
 
06:26:16.628 --> 06:26:16.638 align:start position:0%
co2 generated is is very little
 
06:26:16.638 --> 06:26:17.510 align:start position:0%
co2 generated is is very little
um

06:26:17.510 --> 06:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:26:19.670 --> 06:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
again because you're not going to have
 
06:26:19.680 --> 06:26:20.628 align:start position:0%
again because you're not going to have
um

06:26:20.628 --> 06:26:20.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:26:22.390 --> 06:26:22.400 align:start position:0%
you know especially in pyrolysis
 
06:26:23.910 --> 06:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
technologies there's not oxygen atoms
 
06:26:26.468 --> 06:26:26.478 align:start position:0%
going into the system number two the
 
06:26:31.030 --> 06:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:32.310 --> 06:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
you know you want to use those carbon
 
06:26:33.590 --> 06:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
atoms as i mentioned because that
 
06:26:35.670 --> 06:26:35.680 align:start position:0%
provides that bonds with the hydrogen to
 
06:26:37.590 --> 06:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
form you know your liquid feedstock that
 
06:26:39.430 --> 06:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
you're going to sell
 
06:26:41.110 --> 06:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
when there is you know there's always
 
06:26:43.430 --> 06:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
going to be look to sort of
 
06:26:45.190 --> 06:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
improve the footprint because i think
 
06:26:47.110 --> 06:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
that's a it's an important sort of
 
06:26:49.430 --> 06:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
bigger societal question that you ask is
 
06:26:51.190 --> 06:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
how we continually lower our carbon
 
06:26:53.590 --> 06:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
footprint of everything we're doing
 
06:26:55.670 --> 06:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
and the studies out there now are
 
06:26:57.990 --> 06:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
showing that if you take
 
06:26:59.910 --> 06:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
it you know there's the the one model
 
06:27:01.910 --> 06:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
the linear model where you take oil or
 
06:27:03.830 --> 06:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
natural gas out of the ground you make
 
06:27:05.750 --> 06:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
plastics and then you take them and you
 
06:27:09.110 --> 06:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
either land fill them or you
 
06:27:10.708 --> 06:27:10.718 align:start position:0%
well you do do some recycling as well
 
06:27:12.070 --> 06:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
some mechanical recycling but you either
 
06:27:13.750 --> 06:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
land fill them
 
06:27:15.190 --> 06:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
or you
 
06:27:16.948 --> 06:27:16.958 align:start position:0%
combust them for energy through a waste
 
06:27:18.468 --> 06:27:18.478 align:start position:0%
energy plant and then you have to go
 
06:27:21.590 --> 06:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
back and drill for an additional
 
06:27:23.910 --> 06:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
unit of oil or gas to then make into new
 
06:27:25.830 --> 06:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
plastics again that's one model right
 
06:27:27.910 --> 06:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
right versus model number two of what
 
06:27:29.510 --> 06:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
we're suggesting which is use the
 
06:27:29.520 --> 06:27:31.030 align:start position:0%
we're suggesting which is use the
plastics

06:27:31.030 --> 06:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
plastics
 
06:27:33.590 --> 06:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
instead of landfilling them or
 
06:27:34.948 --> 06:27:34.958 align:start position:0%
combusting them burning them
 
06:27:36.468 --> 06:27:36.478 align:start position:0%
incinerating them
 
06:27:38.230 --> 06:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
take them back turn them back into a
 
06:27:40.230 --> 06:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
liquid feedstock again
 
06:27:43.030 --> 06:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
and displace that additional unit of oil
 
06:27:44.230 --> 06:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
or natural gas
 
06:27:46.390 --> 06:27:46.400 align:start position:0%
the scenario b that i just laid out is
 
06:27:48.150 --> 06:27:48.160 align:start position:0%
going to have a lower greenhouse gas
 
06:27:50.150 --> 06:27:50.160 align:start position:0%
footprint so this is helping us get to
 
06:27:51.830 --> 06:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
lower greenhouse gas is it zero
 
06:27:53.430 --> 06:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gases no but it's not it's
 
06:27:55.270 --> 06:27:55.280 align:start position:0%
going to be lower okay i i guess
 
06:27:57.110 --> 06:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
i'm more concerned about if you're using
 
06:27:59.110 --> 06:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
natural gas or um
 
06:28:02.708 --> 06:28:02.718 align:start position:0%
or the the pyro the the gas fraction of
 
06:28:05.830 --> 06:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
the uh from the pyrolysis
 
06:28:05.840 --> 06:28:06.708 align:start position:0%
the uh from the pyrolysis
then

06:28:06.708 --> 06:28:06.718 align:start position:0%
then
 
06:28:09.510 --> 06:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
that is you know that is potential
 
06:28:12.070 --> 06:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
carbon dioxide and i it sounds like you
 
06:28:14.868 --> 06:28:14.878 align:start position:0%
that that still would be an effluent or
 
06:28:18.390 --> 06:28:18.400 align:start position:0%
a an emission an emittant after
 
06:28:20.230 --> 06:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
in this process so i think we're going
 
06:28:21.910 --> 06:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
to continue to see a greening of the
 
06:28:23.670 --> 06:28:23.680 align:start position:0%
grid which is important as well which
 
06:28:25.270 --> 06:28:25.280 align:start position:0%
will further reduce the footprint of
 
06:28:27.350 --> 06:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
these technologies um
 
06:28:29.190 --> 06:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
uh company agilex based up in the
 
06:28:31.430 --> 06:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
pacific northwest up in uh portland
 
06:28:33.910 --> 06:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
oregon they you know draw
 
06:28:35.750 --> 06:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
renewable energy off the grid because
 
06:28:38.868 --> 06:28:38.878 align:start position:0%
they have a a lot of hydro there so as
 
06:28:40.788 --> 06:28:40.798 align:start position:0%
new hampshire let's say greens its grid
 
06:28:42.788 --> 06:28:42.798 align:start position:0%
i think in the northeast you're very
 
06:28:45.350 --> 06:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
reliant of course on natural gas up here
 
06:28:45.360 --> 06:28:46.788 align:start position:0%
reliant of course on natural gas up here
um

06:28:46.788 --> 06:28:46.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:28:48.230 --> 06:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
you know there's potential there's
 
06:28:49.830 --> 06:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
there's really good greening potential
 
06:28:53.190 --> 06:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
um and and that kind of reminds me is
 
06:28:54.868 --> 06:28:54.878 align:start position:0%
closeup partners which is a new
 
06:28:57.270 --> 06:28:57.280 align:start position:0%
york-based investment firm did a whole
 
06:28:58.628 --> 06:28:58.638 align:start position:0%
very long if you're interested in
 
06:29:00.548 --> 06:29:00.558 align:start position:0%
reading 100 plus pages on these
 
06:29:01.910 --> 06:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
technologies and they cover sort of
 
06:29:03.190 --> 06:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
different types of technologies and
 
06:29:05.190 --> 06:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
inputs did a report that they released
 
06:29:06.868 --> 06:29:06.878 align:start position:0%
in november and they looked at the
 
06:29:08.948 --> 06:29:08.958 align:start position:0%
emissions and they talk about this right
 
06:29:11.910 --> 06:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
number one the lower ghg
 
06:29:13.910 --> 06:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
impact and the potential to get even
 
06:29:16.070 --> 06:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
lower with the greening of the grid okay
 
06:29:18.548 --> 06:29:18.558 align:start position:0%
would you be able to uh send us a
 
06:29:20.948 --> 06:29:20.958 align:start position:0%
reference to that closing we'll send it
 
06:29:23.430 --> 06:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
all okay great thank you representative
 
06:29:26.548 --> 06:29:26.558 align:start position:0%
representative stapleton thank you
 
06:29:29.110 --> 06:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
we hear a lot about
 
06:29:32.230 --> 06:29:32.240 align:start position:0%
lightweight and strong carbon fiber
 
06:29:35.430 --> 06:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
bicycle frames paddles canoes and
 
06:29:37.990 --> 06:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
various other things that is popular now
 
06:29:39.750 --> 06:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
in athletics
 
06:29:41.750 --> 06:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
to what extent if any
 
06:29:42.948 --> 06:29:42.958 align:start position:0%
is char
 
06:29:45.990 --> 06:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
carbon a component of these things or is
 
06:29:48.230 --> 06:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
it completely unrelated
 
06:29:50.230 --> 06:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
you know that's a good question i mean i
 
06:29:50.240 --> 06:29:53.830 align:start position:0%
you know that's a good question i mean i
think

06:29:53.830 --> 06:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:55.430 --> 06:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
i thought you were going a little bit
 
06:29:56.708 --> 06:29:56.718 align:start position:0%
different with that story because i
 
06:29:58.070 --> 06:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
think one of the things from the closed
 
06:30:00.310 --> 06:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
loop report um
 
06:30:01.910 --> 06:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
or in your question one of the things
 
06:30:03.110 --> 06:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
for the close group reported it does
 
06:30:05.110 --> 06:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
talk about the potential textiles is
 
06:30:07.270 --> 06:30:07.280 align:start position:0%
another great example of material that
 
06:30:09.590 --> 06:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
we really don't have solutions for right
 
06:30:11.590 --> 06:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
now and there's a real opportunity
 
06:30:13.430 --> 06:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
because you know again and i mentioned
 
06:30:14.708 --> 06:30:14.718 align:start position:0%
sort of eastman and the work that
 
06:30:16.628 --> 06:30:16.638 align:start position:0%
they're doing around carpet to use
 
06:30:18.468 --> 06:30:18.478 align:start position:0%
advanced recycling technologies to
 
06:30:21.030 --> 06:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
recycle those materials um but you make
 
06:30:23.110 --> 06:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
a good point is as these companies again
 
06:30:24.948 --> 06:30:24.958 align:start position:0%
continue to commercialize
 
06:30:24.958 --> 06:30:25.910 align:start position:0%
continue to commercialize
the

06:30:25.910 --> 06:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:30:25.920 --> 06:30:26.708 align:start position:0%
the
the

06:30:26.708 --> 06:30:26.718 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:30:29.190 --> 06:30:29.200 align:start position:0%
the interest in sort of having a lower
 
06:30:30.948 --> 06:30:30.958 align:start position:0%
and lower environmental impact and that
 
06:30:33.270 --> 06:30:33.280 align:start position:0%
includes any emissions that includes any
 
06:30:35.510 --> 06:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas emissions associated it
 
06:30:38.230 --> 06:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
includes being able to take a by-product
 
06:30:40.150 --> 06:30:40.160 align:start position:0%
and turn it into a product that could go
 
06:30:42.390 --> 06:30:42.400 align:start position:0%
into something like you were mentioning
 
06:30:44.548 --> 06:30:44.558 align:start position:0%
um you know using the carbon that's an
 
06:30:46.468 --> 06:30:46.478 align:start position:0%
interesting opportunity so i think again
 
06:30:48.548 --> 06:30:48.558 align:start position:0%
the the goal here you know these are
 
06:30:50.390 --> 06:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
for-profit companies
 
06:30:50.400 --> 06:30:51.190 align:start position:0%
for-profit companies
so

06:30:51.190 --> 06:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:30:53.270 --> 06:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
they are incented you know to stay in
 
06:30:53.280 --> 06:30:54.230 align:start position:0%
they are incented you know to stay in
business

06:30:54.230 --> 06:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
business
 
06:30:57.190 --> 06:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
to produce something that can be sold as
 
06:30:59.030 --> 06:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
a product right that's the i think
 
06:31:00.948 --> 06:31:00.958 align:start position:0%
really the key thing here
 
06:31:02.788 --> 06:31:02.798 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up representative
 
06:31:05.430 --> 06:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
stapleton yeah the analogy that i can
 
06:31:07.590 --> 06:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
think of going back to the old days in
 
06:31:10.150 --> 06:31:10.160 align:start position:0%
coal mining um you know around coal
 
06:31:12.310 --> 06:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
mining towns like scranton the comb
 
06:31:14.310 --> 06:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
piles all over the place
 
06:31:16.310 --> 06:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
they're non-existent anymore because as
 
06:31:18.868 --> 06:31:18.878 align:start position:0%
technology developed they found a use
 
06:31:22.230 --> 06:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
for these to making briquettes or uh
 
06:31:24.628 --> 06:31:24.638 align:start position:0%
fuel uh
 
06:31:27.830 --> 06:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
liquid fuels or liquid mixtures a coal
 
06:31:27.840 --> 06:31:28.948 align:start position:0%
liquid fuels or liquid mixtures a coal
slurry

06:31:28.948 --> 06:31:28.958 align:start position:0%
slurry
 
06:31:31.910 --> 06:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
um and some even in chemical process and
 
06:31:35.190 --> 06:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
uh virtually used up all of what was a
 
06:31:38.548 --> 06:31:38.558 align:start position:0%
waste for some 50 or 60 years
 
06:31:39.430 --> 06:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:31:41.590 --> 06:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
yeah can i just build on that i think
 
06:31:44.310 --> 06:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
that's a really important point is
 
06:31:45.990 --> 06:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
i think we also have to remember that
 
06:31:47.990 --> 06:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
technology and innovation continues to
 
06:31:48.000 --> 06:31:49.110 align:start position:0%
technology and innovation continues to
improve

06:31:49.110 --> 06:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
improve
 
06:31:50.708 --> 06:31:50.718 align:start position:0%
so there's sort of where we are now
 
06:31:52.070 --> 06:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
which is actually a pretty good place
 
06:31:53.350 --> 06:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
but we're going to continue to get
 
06:31:55.670 --> 06:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
better um an analogy i like to use is
 
06:31:57.670 --> 06:31:57.680 align:start position:0%
you know here's why my iphone is a
 
06:31:59.830 --> 06:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
little cracked but
 
06:31:59.840 --> 06:32:00.948 align:start position:0%
little cracked but
but

06:32:00.948 --> 06:32:00.958 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:32:02.868 --> 06:32:02.878 align:start position:0%
i remember when i first moved to
 
06:32:04.628 --> 06:32:04.638 align:start position:0%
washington um
 
06:32:06.230 --> 06:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
and everybody had these blackberry
 
06:32:07.750 --> 06:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
things and i was like oh that's pretty
 
06:32:08.948 --> 06:32:08.958 align:start position:0%
cool so you can be away from your
 
06:32:10.788 --> 06:32:10.798 align:start position:0%
desktop computer because no one not many
 
06:32:13.430 --> 06:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
people had laptops and you can
 
06:32:15.430 --> 06:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
you can actually send and receive emails
 
06:32:17.830 --> 06:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
away from your your desk uh which is
 
06:32:20.548 --> 06:32:20.558 align:start position:0%
pretty cool at the time and and only
 
06:32:22.548 --> 06:32:22.558 align:start position:0%
certain people had them um
 
06:32:22.558 --> 06:32:24.070 align:start position:0%
certain people had them um
and

06:32:24.070 --> 06:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:32:25.430 --> 06:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
and if you looked at them you know it
 
06:32:26.948 --> 06:32:26.958 align:start position:0%
was kind of a black and white screen you
 
06:32:28.628 --> 06:32:28.638 align:start position:0%
know it actually doubled as a phone but
 
06:32:29.910 --> 06:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
no one really used the phone because it
 
06:32:31.750 --> 06:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't that good and you think where we
 
06:32:33.830 --> 06:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
are you know when the iphone came out a
 
06:32:35.430 --> 06:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
few years later and now where we are
 
06:32:36.948 --> 06:32:36.958 align:start position:0%
with our personal devices there's more
 
06:32:38.310 --> 06:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
technology in this than there is in the
 
06:32:40.868 --> 06:32:40.878 align:start position:0%
computers that sent um our astronauts to
 
06:32:42.468 --> 06:32:42.478 align:start position:0%
the moon so
 
06:32:44.548 --> 06:32:44.558 align:start position:0%
as i talk about greening potential and
 
06:32:47.190 --> 06:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
innovation that continues right so i
 
06:32:49.670 --> 06:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
think that's an important point is
 
06:32:50.868 --> 06:32:50.878 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:32:52.708 --> 06:32:52.718 align:start position:0%
this these technologies have in this
 
06:32:52.718 --> 06:32:53.510 align:start position:0%
this these technologies have in this
this

06:32:53.510 --> 06:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:32:55.430 --> 06:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
business has has changed in just the
 
06:32:57.270 --> 06:32:57.280 align:start position:0%
last couple years and will continue to
 
06:33:00.310 --> 06:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
change and get more efficient and better
 
06:33:00.320 --> 06:33:01.350 align:start position:0%
change and get more efficient and better
um

06:33:01.350 --> 06:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:33:03.110 --> 06:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
and you know and and we've kind of
 
06:33:04.948 --> 06:33:04.958 align:start position:0%
talked about some of the plastics that
 
06:33:07.350 --> 06:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
um you know they don't take right now
 
06:33:08.948 --> 06:33:08.958 align:start position:0%
but there's potential for taking you
 
06:33:10.390 --> 06:33:10.400 align:start position:0%
know additional types of plastics in the
 
06:33:12.468 --> 06:33:12.478 align:start position:0%
future as we continue there's a lot of
 
06:33:13.990 --> 06:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
university research i mean there's an
 
06:33:16.070 --> 06:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity potentially for
 
06:33:16.080 --> 06:33:17.110 align:start position:0%
opportunity potentially for
if

06:33:17.110 --> 06:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
if
 
06:33:17.120 --> 06:33:19.350 align:start position:0%
if
if

06:33:19.350 --> 06:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:21.590 --> 06:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
you know if if you had a technology here
 
06:33:22.788 --> 06:33:22.798 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire for students from the
 
06:33:24.230 --> 06:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
university of new hampshire right to be
 
06:33:25.750 --> 06:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
able to work with these technologies get
 
06:33:28.230 --> 06:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
hands-on experience right and how we do
 
06:33:30.310 --> 06:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
a better job managing our resources
 
06:33:32.948 --> 06:33:32.958 align:start position:0%
after we've used them
 
06:33:32.958 --> 06:33:33.830 align:start position:0%
after we've used them
yep

06:33:33.830 --> 06:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
yep
 
06:33:38.390 --> 06:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:43.430 --> 06:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
yeah so uh one issue that has uh been uh
 
06:33:43.440 --> 06:33:44.230 align:start position:0%
yeah so uh one issue that has uh been uh
been

06:33:44.230 --> 06:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
been
 
06:33:46.548 --> 06:33:46.558 align:start position:0%
sort of on our radar for the last few
 
06:33:49.350 --> 06:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
years in the legislature is
 
06:33:51.110 --> 06:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
06:33:54.230 --> 06:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
is the biomass industry in um in new
 
06:33:56.788 --> 06:33:56.798 align:start position:0%
hampshire so we have a fairly active
 
06:34:00.310 --> 06:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
timber industry and they um harvest a
 
06:34:02.230 --> 06:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
fair number of high grade high grade
 
06:34:05.670 --> 06:34:05.680 align:start position:0%
logs and when you once you mill those
 
06:34:08.548 --> 06:34:08.558 align:start position:0%
logs there's a lot of bark there's a lot
 
06:34:10.788 --> 06:34:10.798 align:start position:0%
of other biomass that is not
 
06:34:13.190 --> 06:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
particularly useful for
 
06:34:14.628 --> 06:34:14.638 align:start position:0%
them for
 
06:34:16.628 --> 06:34:16.638 align:start position:0%
as wood itself and
 
06:34:19.430 --> 06:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh for a long time we had uh you know
 
06:34:20.948 --> 06:34:20.958 align:start position:0%
several biomass
 
06:34:23.350 --> 06:34:23.360 align:start position:0%
energy plants which were not vastly
 
06:34:25.030 --> 06:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
efficient at least i think we're down to
 
06:34:26.948 --> 06:34:26.958 align:start position:0%
maybe one at this point
 
06:34:29.270 --> 06:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
and they needed to have sort of a
 
06:34:29.280 --> 06:34:30.310 align:start position:0%
and they needed to have sort of a
special

06:34:30.310 --> 06:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
special
 
06:34:32.390 --> 06:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
category for their
 
06:34:32.400 --> 06:34:35.190 align:start position:0%
category for their
um

06:34:35.190 --> 06:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:37.830 --> 06:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
for counting their uh
 
06:34:40.230 --> 06:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
the the renewable renewable energy
 
06:34:42.788 --> 06:34:42.798 align:start position:0%
credits for the energy they produced in
 
06:34:45.270 --> 06:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
order to help their balance sheets
 
06:34:45.280 --> 06:34:46.468 align:start position:0%
order to help their balance sheets
uh

06:34:46.468 --> 06:34:46.478 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:34:48.948 --> 06:34:48.958 align:start position:0%
it looks like uh with the way
 
06:34:50.628 --> 06:34:50.638 align:start position:0%
regulations are going
 
06:34:53.270 --> 06:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh now there's going to be less and less
 
06:34:55.670 --> 06:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
of an outlet for that biomass
 
06:34:59.110 --> 06:34:59.120 align:start position:0%
uh on in the energy sector and i was
 
06:35:03.190 --> 06:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
reading about um pyrolysis and it sounds
 
06:35:06.310 --> 06:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
like biomass can uh can be incorporated
 
06:35:09.270 --> 06:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
along with plastics into pyrolysis and
 
06:35:10.788 --> 06:35:10.798 align:start position:0%
that will drive their reaction more
 
06:35:13.430 --> 06:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
towards aromatics rather than alkanes
 
06:35:16.708 --> 06:35:16.718 align:start position:0%
as that something that your
 
06:35:18.468 --> 06:35:18.478 align:start position:0%
that your council is looking at as a
 
06:35:18.478 --> 06:35:19.750 align:start position:0%
that your council is looking at as a
potential

06:35:19.750 --> 06:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
potential
 
06:35:19.760 --> 06:35:20.628 align:start position:0%
potential
uh

06:35:20.628 --> 06:35:20.638 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:35:22.310 --> 06:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
resource in new hampshire
 
06:35:23.510 --> 06:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
i i think
 
06:35:25.270 --> 06:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
i mean most of the companies you know
 
06:35:26.788 --> 06:35:26.798 align:start position:0%
getting started try to you know looking
 
06:35:28.230 --> 06:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
at the low-hanging fruit right which is
 
06:35:30.070 --> 06:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
like your polyethylene and polypropylene
 
06:35:32.070 --> 06:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
uh plastics but i think you hit on
 
06:35:34.230 --> 06:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
something very important right is that i
 
06:35:37.030 --> 06:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
think biomass is going to be
 
06:35:37.040 --> 06:35:38.310 align:start position:0%
think biomass is going to be
increasingly

06:35:38.310 --> 06:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
increasingly
 
06:35:39.750 --> 06:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
a feedstock
 
06:35:41.910 --> 06:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
as the industry looks to get you know
 
06:35:43.990 --> 06:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
the industry as a whole
 
06:35:46.548 --> 06:35:46.558 align:start position:0%
looks to get um
 
06:35:48.868 --> 06:35:48.878 align:start position:0%
you know lower its carbon footprint it's
 
06:35:51.030 --> 06:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
going to continue to look to
 
06:35:53.110 --> 06:35:53.120 align:start position:0%
both recycled products but also
 
06:35:55.750 --> 06:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
feedstocks made from bio uh the
 
06:35:57.910 --> 06:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
mcdonald's drink cup is a great example
 
06:36:01.030 --> 06:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
of sort of a you know one of these um i
 
06:36:02.788 --> 06:36:02.798 align:start position:0%
mentioned the uh
 
06:36:04.868 --> 06:36:04.878 align:start position:0%
the the ellen macarthur foundation and
 
06:36:07.190 --> 06:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
the 400 companies that have committed to
 
06:36:08.708 --> 06:36:08.718 align:start position:0%
you know higher levels of recycled
 
06:36:09.910 --> 06:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
content there's also sort of the
 
06:36:11.270 --> 06:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
spin-off of that is called the u.s
 
06:36:12.948 --> 06:36:12.958 align:start position:0%
plastics pact and about a hundred
 
06:36:14.948 --> 06:36:14.958 align:start position:0%
companies have made commitments to use
 
06:36:17.030 --> 06:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
thirty percent recycled content in their
 
06:36:19.910 --> 06:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
packaging and other products but
 
06:36:21.750 --> 06:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
in that part of that thirty percent is
 
06:36:23.110 --> 06:36:23.120 align:start position:0%
less talked about it's thirty percent
 
06:36:25.830 --> 06:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
either recycled plastics or from
 
06:36:29.270 --> 06:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
sustainably sourced biomass
 
06:36:32.628 --> 06:36:32.638 align:start position:0%
feedstock so i think that's
 
06:36:34.788 --> 06:36:34.798 align:start position:0%
i would say it's less mature
 
06:36:37.270 --> 06:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
than where we are now on the you know on
 
06:36:39.830 --> 06:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
sort of using pyrolysis for recycling
 
06:36:42.230 --> 06:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
plastics but it's definitely coming and
 
06:36:43.510 --> 06:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
you're right i mean there are companies
 
06:36:45.430 --> 06:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
that are looking at sort of how you
 
06:36:47.670 --> 06:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
incorporate biomass it's going to change
 
06:36:49.270 --> 06:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
the molecular structure and then you
 
06:36:51.590 --> 06:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
have different types of outputs that you
 
06:36:54.310 --> 06:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:57.830 --> 06:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
thank you without seeing any further
 
06:37:03.110 --> 06:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:04.708 --> 06:37:04.718 align:start position:0%
i believe there's a gentleman here from
 
06:37:07.030 --> 06:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
the clf that would like to come forward
 
06:37:08.548 --> 06:37:08.558 align:start position:0%
and i just want to be honest with
 
06:37:10.070 --> 06:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
everyone as to where we're at right now
 
06:37:11.590 --> 06:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
i'd like to give you
 
06:37:13.750 --> 06:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
five minutes to come up and
 
06:37:15.590 --> 06:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
speak about the issues and concerns you
 
06:37:16.788 --> 06:37:16.798 align:start position:0%
may have but then we are going to
 
06:37:19.910 --> 06:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
continue this conversation next week
 
06:37:22.788 --> 06:37:22.798 align:start position:0%
at 1pm on tuesday is that correct yep
 
06:37:23.670 --> 06:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:37:26.230 --> 06:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
so um with that i will have you and
 
06:37:27.350 --> 06:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
thanks again for the questions and we'll
 
06:37:29.590 --> 06:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
make sure that we provide um
 
06:37:31.430 --> 06:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
all the reports and other studies that i
 
06:37:33.190 --> 06:37:33.200 align:start position:0%
cited as well like closed loop and good
 
06:37:34.708 --> 06:37:34.718 align:start position:0%
company on admissions and other things
 
06:37:46.868 --> 06:37:46.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:48.310 --> 06:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:37:50.548 --> 06:37:50.558 align:start position:0%
my colleague heidi tremarco was the one
 
06:37:51.510 --> 06:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
who was at the public hearing i
 
06:37:53.110 --> 06:37:53.120 align:start position:0%
apologize for not being able to attend
 
06:37:55.430 --> 06:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
but clf is very interested in this bill
 
06:37:57.110 --> 06:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
and we have a lot of significant
 
06:37:57.120 --> 06:37:58.390 align:start position:0%
and we have a lot of significant
concerns

06:37:58.390 --> 06:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
06:38:01.750 --> 06:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
the first point i'd like to make is that
 
06:38:03.030 --> 06:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
they're not really talking about a
 
06:38:04.788 --> 06:38:04.798 align:start position:0%
manufacturing process in terms of
 
06:38:07.350 --> 06:38:07.360 align:start position:0%
recycling if you think of recycling you
 
06:38:08.948 --> 06:38:08.958 align:start position:0%
think of taking a plastic water bottle
 
06:38:10.230 --> 06:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
and turning it into a plastic water
 
06:38:11.590 --> 06:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
bottle correct
 
06:38:14.070 --> 06:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
so what they're essentially doing with
 
06:38:16.868 --> 06:38:16.878 align:start position:0%
these advanced recycling facilities is
 
06:38:18.788 --> 06:38:18.798 align:start position:0%
they're creating a high-tech murph they
 
06:38:20.468 --> 06:38:20.478 align:start position:0%
are taking plastics and creating it into
 
06:38:23.590 --> 06:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
a feedstock that feedstock the liquid
 
06:38:25.350 --> 06:38:25.360 align:start position:0%
uh generated that they talked about can
 
06:38:26.948 --> 06:38:26.958 align:start position:0%
either be done for two things you can
 
06:38:29.030 --> 06:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
burn it which is from our understanding
 
06:38:30.708 --> 06:38:30.718 align:start position:0%
what is mostly happening to this
 
06:38:32.628 --> 06:38:32.638 align:start position:0%
feedstock it is not being used in a
 
06:38:35.030 --> 06:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
circular fashion to displace oil and gas
 
06:38:37.030 --> 06:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
used for new plastic production it is
 
06:38:39.350 --> 06:38:39.360 align:start position:0%
just being burned it is incineration
 
06:38:41.750 --> 06:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
with extra steps
 
06:38:43.590 --> 06:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
importantly it's very hard to track
 
06:38:45.430 --> 06:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
exactly where this material is going
 
06:38:47.030 --> 06:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
because once you exempt it from solid
 
06:38:48.548 --> 06:38:48.558 align:start position:0%
waste regulations
 
06:38:50.468 --> 06:38:50.478 align:start position:0%
you can't keep track of how much plastic
 
06:38:52.230 --> 06:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
is going into this facility how much
 
06:38:54.548 --> 06:38:54.558 align:start position:0%
plastic is then being sent to a facility
 
06:38:56.310 --> 06:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
to either be used to make new plastic or
 
06:38:57.670 --> 06:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
to be burned
 
06:38:59.910 --> 06:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
so i think it's a little disingenuous to
 
06:39:01.910 --> 06:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
refer to this as manufacturing you're
 
06:39:03.590 --> 06:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
essentially doing the same thing murph
 
06:39:06.468 --> 06:39:06.478 align:start position:0%
is doing which is taking a waste product
 
06:39:07.830 --> 06:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
and murph's it's you know the single
 
06:39:09.270 --> 06:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
stream the dual stream whichever have
 
06:39:09.280 --> 06:39:09.990 align:start position:0%
stream the dual stream whichever have
you

06:39:09.990 --> 06:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:39:11.270 --> 06:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
and then sending it to somewhere where
 
06:39:13.670 --> 06:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
it's manufacturing a new material this
 
06:39:15.830 --> 06:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
is essentially the same thing it is a
 
06:39:17.910 --> 06:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
waste process it should be regulated
 
06:39:19.750 --> 06:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
that way
 
06:39:21.270 --> 06:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
i would also note that they talked about
 
06:39:22.948 --> 06:39:22.958 align:start position:0%
the bills in rhode island connecticut
 
06:39:24.070 --> 06:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
new york
 
06:39:25.990 --> 06:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
all of those bills have failed those
 
06:39:27.670 --> 06:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
states have looked at this and decided
 
06:39:29.190 --> 06:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
that this is not the direction they want
 
06:39:30.548 --> 06:39:30.558 align:start position:0%
to go in because they have significant
 
06:39:32.628 --> 06:39:32.638 align:start position:0%
concerns about whether this is actually
 
06:39:34.548 --> 06:39:34.558 align:start position:0%
true recycling they want to make sure if
 
06:39:36.070 --> 06:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
these facilities are built that they are
 
06:39:37.590 --> 06:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
actually reporting where the waste is
 
06:39:40.230 --> 06:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
coming from where it is going
 
06:39:42.310 --> 06:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
new york recently had an epr bill that
 
06:39:44.070 --> 06:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
had an advanced recycling provision they
 
06:39:45.510 --> 06:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
tanked the whole bill because they were
 
06:39:47.110 --> 06:39:47.120 align:start position:0%
so concerned about including that
 
06:39:52.390 --> 06:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:53.830 --> 06:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
that's the first point i wanted to make
 
06:39:54.948 --> 06:39:54.958 align:start position:0%
they're essentially talking about a
 
06:39:56.948 --> 06:39:56.958 align:start position:0%
material recovery facility not a
 
06:39:58.708 --> 06:39:58.718 align:start position:0%
manufacturing process that the plants
 
06:40:00.628 --> 06:40:00.638 align:start position:0%
that would take this liquid fuel and use
 
06:40:02.310 --> 06:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
it to create new plastics that's
 
06:40:04.390 --> 06:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
certainly manufacturing that wouldn't be
 
06:40:07.030 --> 06:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
governed by the solid waste rules
 
06:40:09.510 --> 06:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
additionally i took issue with the
 
06:40:11.110 --> 06:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
statement that it is better for public
 
06:40:12.628 --> 06:40:12.638 align:start position:0%
health to exempt
 
06:40:14.150 --> 06:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
these types of facilities from the solid
 
06:40:15.910 --> 06:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
waste regulations i wasn't exactly sure
 
06:40:17.510 --> 06:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
of the train of thought there
 
06:40:18.948 --> 06:40:18.958 align:start position:0%
there are significant public health
 
06:40:20.708 --> 06:40:20.718 align:start position:0%
concerns with these facilities and when
 
06:40:22.708 --> 06:40:22.718 align:start position:0%
they're regulated as a waste facility
 
06:40:24.310 --> 06:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
they have to look at things like the
 
06:40:26.310 --> 06:40:26.320 align:start position:0%
public benefit determination whether
 
06:40:27.510 --> 06:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
there is going to be spills of the
 
06:40:29.030 --> 06:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
material they're dealing with what is
 
06:40:30.868 --> 06:40:30.878 align:start position:0%
the process of fires and you can
 
06:40:32.788 --> 06:40:32.798 align:start position:0%
calculate how much is in state versus
 
06:40:34.070 --> 06:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
out of state which i know is something
 
06:40:36.150 --> 06:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is very interested in how
 
06:40:38.310 --> 06:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
much of the plastic will actually be
 
06:40:40.390 --> 06:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
generated in new hampshire for this type
 
06:40:42.468 --> 06:40:42.478 align:start position:0%
of advanced recycling
 
06:40:43.590 --> 06:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
it's important to note that new
 
06:40:45.190 --> 06:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire is i believe the last state in
 
06:40:46.230 --> 06:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
new england where they have tried to
 
06:40:47.830 --> 06:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
push one of these bills they being the
 
06:40:49.510 --> 06:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
american chemistry council they have
 
06:40:51.270 --> 06:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
pushed similar bills identical bills
 
06:40:52.948 --> 06:40:52.958 align:start position:0%
really in rhode island for the past
 
06:40:54.788 --> 06:40:54.798 align:start position:0%
three years which have been continuously
 
06:40:57.510 --> 06:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
struck down
 
06:40:59.670 --> 06:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
i'd also like to point out that the
 
06:41:02.070 --> 06:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
agriliks facility that was described is
 
06:41:03.670 --> 06:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
a perfect example of how this is really
 
06:41:05.510 --> 06:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
a murph so that
 
06:41:07.190 --> 06:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
uses an advanced recycling process
 
06:41:08.468 --> 06:41:08.478 align:start position:0%
called paralysis
 
06:41:10.708 --> 06:41:10.718 align:start position:0%
to break down styrene or polystyrene
 
06:41:13.510 --> 06:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
into styrene it has been found that most
 
06:41:14.868 --> 06:41:14.878 align:start position:0%
of the styrene that they're producing
 
06:41:17.350 --> 06:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
which again styrene is very toxic
 
06:41:19.270 --> 06:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
is being sent to six different states
 
06:41:21.990 --> 06:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
across the country primarily for burning
 
06:41:23.830 --> 06:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
it is essentially a fancy way of
 
06:41:25.510 --> 06:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
incinerating it it's processed in oregon
 
06:41:27.510 --> 06:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
broken down into the monomer styrene
 
06:41:30.868 --> 06:41:30.878 align:start position:0%
sent to colorado nebraska ohio and
 
06:41:30.878 --> 06:41:32.150 align:start position:0%
sent to colorado nebraska ohio and
missouri

06:41:32.150 --> 06:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
missouri
 
06:41:34.628 --> 06:41:34.638 align:start position:0%
as well as louisiana to be burned it is
 
06:41:36.548 --> 06:41:36.558 align:start position:0%
not actually being recycled there's no
 
06:41:39.510 --> 06:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
reporting that is required if you pass
 
06:41:41.030 --> 06:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
this type of bill here in new hampshire
 
06:41:48.868 --> 06:41:48.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:50.390 --> 06:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
i'd also like to point that a lot of the
 
06:41:52.390 --> 06:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
questions talked about it depends
 
06:41:54.310 --> 06:41:54.320 align:start position:0%
advanced recycling is a catch-all term
 
06:41:55.750 --> 06:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
you're talking about paralysis
 
06:41:58.390 --> 06:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
solvolysis gasification
 
06:42:00.310 --> 06:42:00.320 align:start position:0%
there are reasons we have specific
 
06:42:03.430 --> 06:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
regulations for landfills for composting
 
06:42:05.270 --> 06:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
for recycling for the different types of
 
06:42:07.110 --> 06:42:07.120 align:start position:0%
waste management practices that happen
 
06:42:08.788 --> 06:42:08.798 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire that is because they're
 
06:42:10.150 --> 06:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
different ways of dealing with solid
 
06:42:10.160 --> 06:42:11.190 align:start position:0%
different ways of dealing with solid
waste

06:42:11.190 --> 06:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
waste
 
06:42:13.270 --> 06:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
des is responsible for figuring out what
 
06:42:15.030 --> 06:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
kind of bucket something falls into and
 
06:42:16.390 --> 06:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
then crafting regulations that are
 
06:42:18.150 --> 06:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
specific to how we manage that type of
 
06:42:20.070 --> 06:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
waste whether you are dealing with the
 
06:42:21.270 --> 06:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
landfill and you have to make sure that
 
06:42:23.030 --> 06:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
there's not going to be leaks
 
06:42:24.868 --> 06:42:24.878 align:start position:0%
this is a new technology there are
 
06:42:27.270 --> 06:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
significant concerns if you deregulate
 
06:42:28.788 --> 06:42:28.798 align:start position:0%
it now
 
06:42:32.310 --> 06:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
as this industry moves into maturation
 
06:42:33.750 --> 06:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be able to go back
 
06:42:35.110 --> 06:42:35.120 align:start position:0%
and regulate them you can't look at
 
06:42:37.350 --> 06:42:37.360 align:start position:0%
what's going wrong and say okay
 
06:42:38.788 --> 06:42:38.798 align:start position:0%
how can we look at this from a solid
 
06:42:40.468 --> 06:42:40.478 align:start position:0%
waste perspective and pass regulations
 
06:42:42.548 --> 06:42:42.558 align:start position:0%
particular to paralysis
 
06:42:44.070 --> 06:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
or what is the difference between
 
06:42:45.590 --> 06:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
paralysis and solace should there be
 
06:42:47.430 --> 06:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
specific regulations that govern this
 
06:42:49.750 --> 06:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
type of process you'd essentially be
 
06:42:53.750 --> 06:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
restricting it just to the air permits
 
06:42:55.510 --> 06:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
and additionally i'd like to point out
 
06:42:57.110 --> 06:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
that yesterday there was actually a
 
06:42:57.120 --> 06:42:58.548 align:start position:0%
that yesterday there was actually a
report

06:42:58.548 --> 06:42:58.558 align:start position:0%
report
 
06:43:00.230 --> 06:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
that in georgia one of the states that
 
06:43:02.468 --> 06:43:02.478 align:start position:0%
have deregulated this
 
06:43:03.910 --> 06:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
still was not able to get one of these
 
06:43:05.030 --> 06:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
facilities off the ground because
 
06:43:06.868 --> 06:43:06.878 align:start position:0%
they're really just not economically
 
06:43:09.190 --> 06:43:09.200 align:start position:0%
viable when you think about the process
 
06:43:10.628 --> 06:43:10.638 align:start position:0%
you're taking plastics trying to break
 
06:43:12.390 --> 06:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
it down into a monomer to create new
 
06:43:14.150 --> 06:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
plastics you're competing against the
 
06:43:16.708 --> 06:43:16.718 align:start position:0%
price of oil and natural gas which is
 
06:43:18.468 --> 06:43:18.478 align:start position:0%
significantly low even with the inflated
 
06:43:19.910 --> 06:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
numbers that we're seeing right now it
 
06:43:19.920 --> 06:43:20.868 align:start position:0%
numbers that we're seeing right now it
is

06:43:20.868 --> 06:43:20.878 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:43:23.110 --> 06:43:23.120 align:start position:0%
dirt cheaper to use that than to
 
06:43:24.948 --> 06:43:24.958 align:start position:0%
actually go through this technological
 
06:43:26.548 --> 06:43:26.558 align:start position:0%
process to create that feedstock which
 
06:43:28.390 --> 06:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
is why most of this stuff is just being
 
06:43:28.400 --> 06:43:29.430 align:start position:0%
is why most of this stuff is just being
burned

06:43:29.430 --> 06:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
burned
 
06:43:31.350 --> 06:43:31.360 align:start position:0%
so in georgia
 
06:43:32.868 --> 06:43:32.878 align:start position:0%
even though they deregulated it the
 
06:43:34.150 --> 06:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
facility they were talking about it's a
 
06:43:36.070 --> 06:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
bright mark facility it was going to be
 
06:43:37.750 --> 06:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
about 600 million dollars they wanted
 
06:43:39.830 --> 06:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
public funds to do it a condition of
 
06:43:41.910 --> 06:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
getting those public funds was that they
 
06:43:43.750 --> 06:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
needed to identify that the existing
 
06:43:48.070 --> 06:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
facility that breitmark had in indiana
 
06:43:49.670 --> 06:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
actually had a buyer for the material
 
06:43:51.110 --> 06:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
that they were creating they weren't
 
06:43:53.110 --> 06:43:53.120 align:start position:0%
specific whether that was go a buyer to
 
06:43:54.708 --> 06:43:54.718 align:start position:0%
burn the material an incinerator or a
 
06:43:57.430 --> 06:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
cement kiln or to use it to create a new
 
06:43:59.350 --> 06:43:59.360 align:start position:0%
type of plastic the threshold was
 
06:44:01.350 --> 06:44:01.360 align:start position:0%
significantly low just prove the
 
06:44:03.590 --> 06:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
existing facility you have before you
 
06:44:05.510 --> 06:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
build this new one in georgia
 
06:44:07.350 --> 06:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
actually works and they couldn't do it
 
06:44:09.510 --> 06:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
so the public funding was taken and the
 
06:44:11.670 --> 06:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
facility's not moving forward i'd point
 
06:44:15.430 --> 06:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:19.830 --> 06:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
149 m-9 roman numeral 3 has a similar
 
06:44:19.840 --> 06:44:21.110 align:start position:0%
149 m-9 roman numeral 3 has a similar
provision

06:44:21.110 --> 06:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
provision
 
06:44:23.030 --> 06:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
whenever dealing with a permit for solid
 
06:44:24.628 --> 06:44:24.638 align:start position:0%
waste des is allowed to look into the
 
06:44:26.468 --> 06:44:26.478 align:start position:0%
economic viability they can look at the
 
06:44:28.788 --> 06:44:28.798 align:start position:0%
backers of a project and see how have
 
06:44:30.868 --> 06:44:30.878 align:start position:0%
they fared in other jurisdictions do
 
06:44:32.948 --> 06:44:32.958 align:start position:0%
they have the financial ability to move
 
06:44:35.350 --> 06:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
forward with this project so that's one
 
06:44:37.030 --> 06:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
of the key considerations that would be
 
06:44:39.350 --> 06:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
removed if you deregulate this in one
 
06:44:41.110 --> 06:44:41.120 align:start position:0%
fell swoop
 
06:44:42.868 --> 06:44:42.878 align:start position:0%
and in terms of working with the local
 
06:44:44.230 --> 06:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
governments which they said they try to
 
06:44:46.150 --> 06:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
do when building these facilities i
 
06:44:47.750 --> 06:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
would note you're removing the public
 
06:44:49.510 --> 06:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
notice and comment process the public
 
06:44:51.510 --> 06:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
hearings that are all associated with
 
06:44:53.190 --> 06:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
waste facilities something that's
 
06:44:55.350 --> 06:44:55.360 align:start position:0%
incredibly important as you've seen from
 
06:44:56.948 --> 06:44:56.958 align:start position:0%
the ongoing issues with the granite
 
06:44:58.788 --> 06:44:58.798 align:start position:0%
state landfill when you're building
 
06:45:00.868 --> 06:45:00.878 align:start position:0%
waste facilities which in cf's view this
 
06:45:02.948 --> 06:45:02.958 align:start position:0%
is a waste facility people have
 
06:45:04.548 --> 06:45:04.558 align:start position:0%
significant concerns you're talking
 
06:45:07.270 --> 06:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
about bringing a lot of waste to a
 
06:45:07.280 --> 06:45:08.310 align:start position:0%
about bringing a lot of waste to a
community

06:45:08.310 --> 06:45:08.320 align:start position:0%
community
 
06:45:09.830 --> 06:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
and in this instance there will be air
 
06:45:09.840 --> 06:45:10.948 align:start position:0%
and in this instance there will be air
emissions

06:45:10.948 --> 06:45:10.958 align:start position:0%
emissions
 
06:45:12.948 --> 06:45:12.958 align:start position:0%
and people deserve to have a say in that
 
06:45:14.628 --> 06:45:14.638 align:start position:0%
they deserve to be able to say is this
 
06:45:16.150 --> 06:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
the right choice for us and go to the
 
06:45:17.750 --> 06:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
des and work through the permitting
 
06:45:17.760 --> 06:45:18.948 align:start position:0%
des and work through the permitting
process

06:45:18.948 --> 06:45:18.958 align:start position:0%
process
 
06:45:21.110 --> 06:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
that public process will be taken out if
 
06:45:23.270 --> 06:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
you deregulate this so it's not just
 
06:45:25.510 --> 06:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
about the specific permitting factors
 
06:45:27.430 --> 06:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
that are addressed for public health
 
06:45:29.350 --> 06:45:29.360 align:start position:0%
environmental safety you're talking
 
06:45:31.030 --> 06:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
about removing local control and the
 
06:45:32.788 --> 06:45:32.798 align:start position:0%
ability to weigh in on whether this
 
06:45:34.948 --> 06:45:34.958 align:start position:0%
facility should be developed
 
06:45:36.948 --> 06:45:36.958 align:start position:0%
so those are the main points i had based
 
06:45:39.030 --> 06:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
on kind of the thank you conversations i
 
06:45:41.030 --> 06:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
heard i'm happy to answer any questions
 
06:45:43.190 --> 06:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
and be back next tuesday all right
 
06:45:45.190 --> 06:45:45.200 align:start position:0%
representative contra has a question and
 
06:45:46.468 --> 06:45:46.478 align:start position:0%
then i'm going to go to representative
 
06:45:49.830 --> 06:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
homeowner and then representative bixby
 
06:45:50.788 --> 06:45:50.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:45:52.708 --> 06:45:52.718 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking
 
06:45:54.628 --> 06:45:54.638 align:start position:0%
actually this question is for everyone
 
06:45:56.468 --> 06:45:56.478 align:start position:0%
in the room
 
06:45:58.948 --> 06:45:58.958 align:start position:0%
so my question is is because we've heard
 
06:46:00.830 --> 06:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
contradictory information
 
06:46:03.830 --> 06:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
regarding house bills that are now in
 
06:46:03.840 --> 06:46:05.430 align:start position:0%
regarding house bills that are now in
legislation

06:46:05.430 --> 06:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
06:46:07.830 --> 06:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
that either have passed have not been
 
06:46:10.628 --> 06:46:10.638 align:start position:0%
passed or in study in each of those
 
06:46:12.868 --> 06:46:12.878 align:start position:0%
states that were mentioned i would like
 
06:46:15.110 --> 06:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
to know the bill numbers and the status
 
06:46:17.270 --> 06:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
of those bills for next tuesday's
 
06:46:19.830 --> 06:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
meeting if that's possible
 
06:46:22.070 --> 06:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:46:22.080 --> 06:46:24.230 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

06:46:24.230 --> 06:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:46:26.788 --> 06:46:26.798 align:start position:0%
yes um thank you so much uh
 
06:46:28.468 --> 06:46:28.478 align:start position:0%
one of the things i was actually kind of
 
06:46:30.310 --> 06:46:30.320 align:start position:0%
curious about i'm i'm listening and i'm
 
06:46:33.110 --> 06:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
trying to understand your major concerns
 
06:46:36.628 --> 06:46:36.638 align:start position:0%
and one of the we heard from des prior
 
06:46:38.150 --> 06:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
to you speaking
 
06:46:39.830 --> 06:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
is one of your concerns that you feel
 
06:46:42.468 --> 06:46:42.478 align:start position:0%
like you have unique information that
 
06:46:45.430 --> 06:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps des doesn't have available to
 
06:46:47.110 --> 06:46:47.120 align:start position:0%
them because i didn't get the impression
 
06:46:50.948 --> 06:46:50.958 align:start position:0%
that they share your concerns
 
06:46:52.390 --> 06:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
clf has been paying attention to
 
06:46:54.230 --> 06:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
advanced recycling for quite some time
 
06:46:55.670 --> 06:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
we've worked on the bills in rhode
 
06:46:57.990 --> 06:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
island connecticut massachusetts to an
 
06:46:59.590 --> 06:46:59.600 align:start position:0%
extent in new jersey and to an extent to
 
06:47:01.750 --> 06:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
new york so we are significantly
 
06:47:03.030 --> 06:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
concerned about the air emissions
 
06:47:05.590 --> 06:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
related to these facilities and
 
06:47:07.830 --> 06:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
exempting them full sail from solid
 
06:47:09.910 --> 06:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
waste specifically again that reporting
 
06:47:12.628 --> 06:47:12.638 align:start position:0%
requirement not being able to understand
 
06:47:14.390 --> 06:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
where is the plastic coming from is that
 
06:47:16.150 --> 06:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
plastic being turned into a fuel that is
 
06:47:18.468 --> 06:47:18.478 align:start position:0%
then burned an incinerator in a cement
 
06:47:20.468 --> 06:47:20.478 align:start position:0%
kiln or actually turned into a plastic
 
06:47:22.708 --> 06:47:22.718 align:start position:0%
we see this as a green washing system
 
06:47:25.430 --> 06:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
and we really are worried about how can
 
06:47:28.548 --> 06:47:28.558 align:start position:0%
you actually heat these materials and
 
06:47:30.708 --> 06:47:30.718 align:start position:0%
not have those byproducts released into
 
06:47:33.270 --> 06:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
the air and there are many facilities
 
06:47:34.628 --> 06:47:34.638 align:start position:0%
that have been taking this mostly the
 
06:47:36.150 --> 06:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
ones that burn not the ones that turn it
 
06:47:37.670 --> 06:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
into new plastics because there are very
 
06:47:38.868 --> 06:47:38.878 align:start position:0%
few of them
 
06:47:40.948 --> 06:47:40.958 align:start position:0%
that have serious clean air act
 
06:47:42.788 --> 06:47:42.798 align:start position:0%
violations there's a facility in georgia
 
06:47:44.868 --> 06:47:44.878 align:start position:0%
they just were fined i think 10 million
 
06:47:46.948 --> 06:47:46.958 align:start position:0%
dollars under a title v clean air act
 
06:47:50.468 --> 06:47:50.478 align:start position:0%
lawsuit they take styrene to
 
06:47:52.548 --> 06:47:52.558 align:start position:0%
burn from advanced recycling facilities
 
06:47:54.390 --> 06:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
so we have reports which i'm glad to
 
06:47:56.548 --> 06:47:56.558 align:start position:0%
share with the committee and to des so
 
06:47:58.788 --> 06:47:58.798 align:start position:0%
could i just quickly so just to confirm
 
06:47:59.910 --> 06:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
to make sure i understand what you're
 
06:48:02.230 --> 06:48:02.240 align:start position:0%
saying you're saying that based off the
 
06:48:03.910 --> 06:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
information you have
 
06:48:07.190 --> 06:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
you feel as if it may be
 
06:48:09.270 --> 06:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
it yields a different result than what
 
06:48:11.190 --> 06:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
des is coming up with
 
06:48:13.750 --> 06:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
06:48:15.990 --> 06:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
representative bixby and then
 
06:48:17.350 --> 06:48:17.360 align:start position:0%
uh representative kaplan and i think
 
06:48:18.868 --> 06:48:18.878 align:start position:0%
then we're gonna have to call it for the
 
06:48:20.548 --> 06:48:20.558 align:start position:0%
day and in the interest of time for
 
06:48:22.708 --> 06:48:22.718 align:start position:0%
everybody and then we will continue this
 
06:48:24.708 --> 06:48:24.718 align:start position:0%
next tuesday at 1pm
 
06:48:26.150 --> 06:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
so um
 
06:48:28.788 --> 06:48:28.798 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if uh
 
06:48:32.150 --> 06:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
if we were to mend this to uh put in a
 
06:48:33.910 --> 06:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
stipulation that
 
06:48:33.920 --> 06:48:35.270 align:start position:0%
stipulation that
uh

06:48:35.270 --> 06:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:48:37.350 --> 06:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
the in the definition of advanced
 
06:48:40.230 --> 06:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
recycling saying that if the
 
06:48:41.410 --> 06:48:41.420 align:start position:0%
uh that um
 
06:48:41.420 --> 06:48:42.548 align:start position:0%
uh that um
[Music]

06:48:42.548 --> 06:48:42.558 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:48:46.070 --> 06:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
using the products of this as fuel would
 
06:48:46.080 --> 06:48:47.190 align:start position:0%
using the products of this as fuel would
uh

06:48:47.190 --> 06:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:48:49.510 --> 06:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
void that classification as advanced
 
06:48:53.830 --> 06:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
recycling uh would that um
 
06:48:56.150 --> 06:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
would that address some of your issues
 
06:48:57.430 --> 06:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
that would definitely address some of
 
06:48:58.788 --> 06:48:58.798 align:start position:0%
our issues and i think that would be in
 
06:49:00.310 --> 06:49:00.320 align:start position:0%
the interest of transparency to
 
06:49:02.468 --> 06:49:02.478 align:start position:0%
understand where the liquid fuel that is
 
06:49:06.230 --> 06:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:08.150 --> 06:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
06:49:09.990 --> 06:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we are
 
06:49:12.070 --> 06:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
considering in in other venues in this
 
06:49:14.708 --> 06:49:14.718 align:start position:0%
committee is uh advanced producer
 
06:49:17.350 --> 06:49:17.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility which would in which
 
06:49:19.110 --> 06:49:19.120 align:start position:0%
could include advanced resp
 
06:49:21.750 --> 06:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility for single-use plastics
 
06:49:21.760 --> 06:49:22.628 align:start position:0%
responsibility for single-use plastics
and

06:49:22.628 --> 06:49:22.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:49:24.150 --> 06:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
one of the questions that will come up
 
06:49:26.788 --> 06:49:26.798 align:start position:0%
with that is well if the response the
 
06:49:29.110 --> 06:49:29.120 align:start position:0%
re uh if the manufacturer
 
06:49:32.708 --> 06:49:32.718 align:start position:0%
recaptures those uh those plastics
 
06:49:34.868 --> 06:49:34.878 align:start position:0%
what do they do with them then
 
06:49:34.878 --> 06:49:35.830 align:start position:0%
what do they do with them then
and

06:49:35.830 --> 06:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:49:38.948 --> 06:49:38.958 align:start position:0%
one possibility is
 
06:49:41.110 --> 06:49:41.120 align:start position:0%
some sort of advanced recycling
 
06:49:44.230 --> 06:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:46.468 --> 06:49:46.478 align:start position:0%
further regulation would be necessary
 
06:49:48.548 --> 06:49:48.558 align:start position:0%
for advanced recycling in order to make
 
06:49:51.350 --> 06:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
it really workable
 
06:49:52.868 --> 06:49:52.878 align:start position:0%
and this is something that you if you
 
06:49:54.468 --> 06:49:54.478 align:start position:0%
want to come back with this next week
 
06:49:55.750 --> 06:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
that's fine
 
06:49:55.760 --> 06:49:56.548 align:start position:0%
that's fine
um

06:49:56.548 --> 06:49:56.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:49:58.708 --> 06:49:58.718 align:start position:0%
i will note that there are two extended
 
06:50:00.150 --> 06:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
producer responsibility for packaging
 
06:50:02.230 --> 06:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
laws in the u.s one in maine and one in
 
06:50:03.830 --> 06:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
oregon i worked very heavily on the one
 
06:50:04.868 --> 06:50:04.878 align:start position:0%
in maine
 
06:50:06.788 --> 06:50:06.798 align:start position:0%
we were very careful to make sure that
 
06:50:08.310 --> 06:50:08.320 align:start position:0%
there was no advanced recycling
 
06:50:11.270 --> 06:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
definition in that bill that the key
 
06:50:12.948 --> 06:50:12.958 align:start position:0%
part of making sure that when you have
 
06:50:14.628 --> 06:50:14.638 align:start position:0%
an extended producer responsibility for
 
06:50:17.030 --> 06:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
packaging system designed for a specific
 
06:50:19.350 --> 06:50:19.360 align:start position:0%
state is to make sure that recyclability
 
06:50:21.350 --> 06:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
is actually being used not at a national
 
06:50:22.708 --> 06:50:22.718 align:start position:0%
level where something is theoretically
 
06:50:25.110 --> 06:50:25.120 align:start position:0%
recyclable and that's an important part
 
06:50:27.430 --> 06:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
with this the agrocycle
 
06:50:29.830 --> 06:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
rolex facility in oregon
 
06:50:32.230 --> 06:50:32.240 align:start position:0%
is shipping that material very far that
 
06:50:34.468 --> 06:50:34.478 align:start position:0%
is a lot of greenhouse gases to to just
 
06:50:36.548 --> 06:50:36.558 align:start position:0%
burn the material so you want to make
 
06:50:38.468 --> 06:50:38.478 align:start position:0%
sure that with epr for packaging the
 
06:50:40.150 --> 06:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
definition of recycling refers to the
 
06:50:41.750 --> 06:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
actual jurisdiction can something be
 
06:50:43.830 --> 06:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
captured in new hampshire processed and
 
06:50:45.350 --> 06:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
turned into a new product is there an
 
06:50:47.350 --> 06:50:47.360 align:start position:0%
end market that is specific to the state
 
06:50:49.110 --> 06:50:49.120 align:start position:0%
or the region and with advanced
 
06:50:51.350 --> 06:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
recycling we don't see that as an actual
 
06:50:51.360 --> 06:50:52.628 align:start position:0%
recycling we don't see that as an actual
possibility

06:50:52.628 --> 06:50:52.638 align:start position:0%
possibility
 
06:50:54.230 --> 06:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
most of the facilities are going to be
 
06:50:55.670 --> 06:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
in the south where they are not as
 
06:50:58.390 --> 06:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
stringent regulations and that's
 
06:51:01.350 --> 06:51:01.360 align:start position:0%
mostly where this material is going
 
06:51:03.270 --> 06:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
thank you and the final question goes to
 
06:51:05.270 --> 06:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative kaplan this is just to
 
06:51:07.110 --> 06:51:07.120 align:start position:0%
clarify a point that uh representative
 
06:51:08.948 --> 06:51:08.958 align:start position:0%
homolo was asking about
 
06:51:10.310 --> 06:51:10.320 align:start position:0%
because we heard from the des that
 
06:51:13.030 --> 06:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
they're comfortable uh that a facility
 
06:51:14.230 --> 06:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
like this coming into the state under
 
06:51:16.708 --> 06:51:16.718 align:start position:0%
the current manufacturing regulations
 
06:51:18.070 --> 06:51:18.080 align:start position:0%
that they would be able to make the
 
06:51:19.990 --> 06:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
determination as to what kind of permit
 
06:51:22.868 --> 06:51:22.878 align:start position:0%
uh would be uh applicable based on the
 
06:51:24.628 --> 06:51:24.638 align:start position:0%
reporting from the facility as to the
 
06:51:27.910 --> 06:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
feed stocks as to the processes
 
06:51:29.750 --> 06:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
what about that process
 
06:51:31.190 --> 06:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
makes you come to
 
06:51:32.708 --> 06:51:32.718 align:start position:0%
the conclusion or what about the
 
06:51:34.390 --> 06:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
regulations in new hampshire makes you
 
06:51:36.310 --> 06:51:36.320 align:start position:0%
come to the conclusion that
 
06:51:37.910 --> 06:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't really quite capture the real
 
06:51:37.920 --> 06:51:39.350 align:start position:0%
wouldn't really quite capture the real
picture

06:51:39.350 --> 06:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
picture
 
06:51:40.948 --> 06:51:40.958 align:start position:0%
that it shouldn't be a permit exam
 
06:51:42.150 --> 06:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
facility that it should be treated the
 
06:51:43.910 --> 06:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
same way a material recovery facility
 
06:51:45.190 --> 06:51:45.200 align:start position:0%
would be treated which is you need to
 
06:51:46.708 --> 06:51:46.718 align:start position:0%
make sure how much inbound material is
 
06:51:48.390 --> 06:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
actually going to the facility where is
 
06:51:50.070 --> 06:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
that material going after that the
 
06:51:51.350 --> 06:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
material is actually being managed in a
 
06:51:54.628 --> 06:51:54.638 align:start position:0%
proper and environmentally safe manner
 
06:51:56.868 --> 06:51:56.878 align:start position:0%
we are significantly concerned again
 
06:51:58.948 --> 06:51:58.958 align:start position:0%
that what des may think now their
 
06:52:01.350 --> 06:52:01.360 align:start position:0%
current interpretation is based on a lot
 
06:52:03.110 --> 06:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
of theoretical
 
06:52:04.708 --> 06:52:04.718 align:start position:0%
information there are not a lot of these
 
06:52:06.230 --> 06:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
facilities that are actually working
 
06:52:07.510 --> 06:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
there is not a lot of information on
 
06:52:08.948 --> 06:52:08.958 align:start position:0%
these facilities because they have been
 
06:52:11.190 --> 06:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
deregulated in 18 states
 
06:52:13.590 --> 06:52:13.600 align:start position:0%
if you exempt this now you can't go back
 
06:52:15.030 --> 06:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
you need to pass a new legislation
 
06:52:17.350 --> 06:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
saying that now it's solid waste again
 
06:52:19.750 --> 06:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
let's develop some site specific
 
06:52:21.350 --> 06:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
or not site specific but industry
 
06:52:23.270 --> 06:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
specific regulations so first and
 
06:52:24.788 --> 06:52:24.798 align:start position:0%
foremost i feel it would qualify as a
 
06:52:27.030 --> 06:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
murph second you'd be completely cutting
 
06:52:29.270 --> 06:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
off any ability to regulate them which
 
06:52:32.628 --> 06:52:32.638 align:start position:0%
is it's an innovative new technology and
 
06:52:34.390 --> 06:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
we need to learn how to deal with this
 
06:52:35.830 --> 06:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
and figure out regulations that are
 
06:52:40.548 --> 06:52:40.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:48.948 --> 06:52:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:50.948 --> 06:52:50.958 align:start position:0%
she's welcome to send that along to us
 
06:52:52.868 --> 06:52:52.878 align:start position:0%
and if she emails that to the entire
 
06:52:54.390 --> 06:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
committee to house environment and
 
06:52:56.310 --> 06:52:56.320 align:start position:0%
agriculture we will all get it including
 
06:52:57.430 --> 06:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
the members who are not on the
 
06:52:59.190 --> 06:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work session so please send
 
06:53:01.270 --> 06:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
that along and with that we will see
 
06:53:04.708 --> 06:53:04.718 align:start position:0%
everybody again on the 19th at 1 p.m
 
06:53:20.468 --> 06:53:20.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:20.478 --> 06:53:37.830 align:start position:0%
 
yes

06:53:37.830 --> 06:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:53.590 --> 06:53:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:39.990 --> 06:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:40.000 --> 06:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
you
