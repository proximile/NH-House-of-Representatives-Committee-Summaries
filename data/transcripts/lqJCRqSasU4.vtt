00:06:58.950 --> 00:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
uh in order to
 
00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.469 align:start position:0%
uh in order to
explain

00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
explain
 
00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:01.510 align:start position:0%
explain
why

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
a study committee is necessary and would
 
00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
be a good idea on this bill i need to
 
00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:09.759 align:start position:0%
give some background to the
 
00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:13.039 align:start position:0%
uh the factual situation that has given
 
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
rise to it i'll be a little bit brief
 
00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
about some of the history
 
00:07:21.589 --> 00:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
because one of the uh speakers today
 
00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
is alicia powell
 
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
who is
 
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
a part of the adams family that owns
 
00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
wendyhurst farm
 
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh winnie hirst farm is located in in
 
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
west milan it is a uh
 
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
is somewhat of an icon in our community
 
00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
west milan is a uh for those who don't
 
00:07:39.599 --> 00:07:40.390 align:start position:0%
west milan is a uh for those who don't
know

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
is a small town between uh keene and
 
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
brattleboro vermont and is in many
 
00:07:49.749 --> 00:07:49.759 align:start position:0%
respects a town of small farms so we pay
 
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
attention to our small farms and we like
 
00:07:54.309 --> 00:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
to keep our small farms
 
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
the issue that came up
 
00:07:59.430 --> 00:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh that came to my attention
 
00:08:01.029 --> 00:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
was that
 
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
the adams family that
 
00:08:06.629 --> 00:08:06.639 align:start position:0%
has owned and run windyhurst farm for a
 
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
very long time entered into a
 
00:08:11.589 --> 00:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
conservation easement
 
00:08:14.469 --> 00:08:14.479 align:start position:0%
back in the 1980s
 
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
and i have
 
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
more recently been told
 
00:08:22.309 --> 00:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
uh by its state government
 
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
that a particular use or two
 
00:08:28.869 --> 00:08:28.879 align:start position:0%
of the land subject to the conservation
 
00:08:28.879 --> 00:08:30.309 align:start position:0%
of the land subject to the conservation
easement

00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
easement
 
00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
is in violation and they would have to
 
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.029 align:start position:0%
 
they

00:08:37.029 --> 00:08:37.039 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:08:39.509 --> 00:08:39.519 align:start position:0%
received a letter
 
00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:41.919 align:start position:0%
from stephen walker who's the director
 
00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
of the conservation land stewardship
 
00:08:43.839 --> 00:08:44.870 align:start position:0%
of the conservation land stewardship
program

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:47.519 align:start position:0%
and i know one part of it which says
 
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
that these uses do not conform to the
 
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
definition of agriculture at the time
 
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
the conservation easement was completed
 
00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
and which definition remains in effect
 
00:08:59.509 --> 00:08:59.519 align:start position:0%
and i want to get back to that in a
 
00:08:59.519 --> 00:09:00.550 align:start position:0%
and i want to get back to that in a
moment

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
moment
 
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
um so they they attempted to to resolve
 
00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
this they ended up hiring an attorney
 
00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:08.720 align:start position:0%
named gary kenyon gary kenyon contacted
 
00:09:10.389 --> 00:09:10.399 align:start position:0%
the ag's office
 
00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
uh it got bumped up to the next higher
 
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:13.670 align:start position:0%
uh it got bumped up to the next higher
level

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
which is a christopher aslan senior
 
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:18.160 align:start position:0%
assistant attorney general
 
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
who said
 
00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.829 align:start position:0%
who said
that

00:09:20.829 --> 00:09:20.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh in order to respect the legislature's
 
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.269 align:start position:0%
uh in order to respect the legislature's
authority

00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
authority
 
00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
um the conservation land uh program
 
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
is not in position to negotiate a land
 
00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
swap or any other adjustment
 
00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
absent an indication that mr stewart has
 
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
secured a legislative sponsor for a
 
00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
legislative solution
 
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:45.200 align:start position:0%
basically said should the legislative
 
00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
process be initiated clsp will work with
 
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
whitneyhurst farm and the legislature to
 
00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
find a reasonable
 
00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.110 align:start position:0%
find a reasonable
solution

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
solution
 
00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
so they got a hold of me
 
00:09:59.509 --> 00:09:59.519 align:start position:0%
and said they can't get anywhere their
 
00:10:00.949 --> 00:10:00.959 align:start position:0%
lawyer can't get anywhere and they're
 
00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
told to file a bill
 
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
so i reached out to um
 
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
sean jasper the commissioner of
 
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
agriculture and the former speaker of
 
00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
the house
 
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
and talked to him about it he's familiar
 
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
with the uh
 
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
with the farm he's very supportive of
 
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
the farm and said that he had to support
 
00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:21.750 align:start position:0%
the farm and said that he had to support
the

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office and that i
 
00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.509 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office and that i
should

00:10:25.509 --> 00:10:25.519 align:start position:0%
should
 
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
file a bill
 
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:29.200 align:start position:0%
so i filed this bill
 
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
and believe me
 
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
little did i know it was like stepping
 
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
on a or mowing over a hornet's nest
 
00:10:37.829 --> 00:10:37.839 align:start position:0%
i've done that once i think it was
 
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
yellow jackets i don't want to do that
 
00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.030 align:start position:0%
yellow jackets i don't want to do that
again

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.230 align:start position:0%
again
um

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:46.389 --> 00:10:46.399 align:start position:0%
and that's resulted in a pile of letters
 
00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
that you have received
 
00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
and has resulted me in having zoom
 
00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.910 align:start position:0%
and has resulted me in having zoom
conversations

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
conversations
 
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
emails phone calls with a host of
 
00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
government officials and many many many
 
00:10:59.590 --> 00:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in the
 
00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:02.240 align:start position:0%
easement community boy did i not know
 
00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
what i was stepping into all right
 
00:11:05.279 --> 00:11:06.150 align:start position:0%
what i was stepping into all right
um

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:07.269 --> 00:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
to put it
 
00:11:07.279 --> 00:11:08.630 align:start position:0%
to put it
shortly

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
shortly
 
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.790 align:start position:0%
shortly
um

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
by everybody not everybody's but most
 
00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
people's agreement
 
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:17.200 align:start position:0%
the easement entered into in the 1980s
 
00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
along with a number of others is a
 
00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
horrible easement they don't draft them
 
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
like this anymore
 
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
they've changed how they drafted and
 
00:11:28.069 --> 00:11:28.079 align:start position:0%
nowadays they're much better easements
 
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
and in fact the law got changed by the
 
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
legislature after a court case i think
 
00:11:35.509 --> 00:11:35.519 align:start position:0%
it was forester versus henniker
 
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
in the 1990s
 
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh to change the definition of
 
00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
agriculture which is interesting that
 
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
the ag's office hasn't acknowledged that
 
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
yet when they wrote and said the
 
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:47.200 align:start position:0%
definition of agriculture hasn't changed
 
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
because it did
 
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
it changed by by legislative decree
 
00:11:52.079 --> 00:11:53.430 align:start position:0%
it changed by by legislative decree
so

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
the problem here is
 
00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
is that everybody admits that
 
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
not everybody but many admit that these
 
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.110 align:start position:0%
not everybody but many admit that these
early

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
early
 
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
leases the early uh easements are
 
00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.269 align:start position:0%
leases the early uh easements are
problematic

00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
problematic
 
00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
but nobody wants to deal with it
 
00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.509 align:start position:0%
but nobody wants to deal with it
and

00:12:09.509 --> 00:12:09.519 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
thus we get a whole bunch of these
 
00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:13.829 align:start position:0%
thus we get a whole bunch of these
letters

00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:13.839 align:start position:0%
letters
 
00:12:13.839 --> 00:12:15.509 align:start position:0%
letters
um

00:12:15.509 --> 00:12:15.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
conservation easements under the law can
 
00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:20.959 align:start position:0%
be changed there are whole treatises
 
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
involved in that
 
00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.350 align:start position:0%
involved in that
um

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
there's a group called one of the
 
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
leading groups is the land trust
 
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
associate alliance
 
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.310 align:start position:0%
associate alliance
um

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:34.949 --> 00:12:34.959 align:start position:0%
a quote from their uh
 
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
magazine saving land in 2014
 
00:12:40.389 --> 00:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
most people in the land trust community
 
00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
believe that in certain circumstances
 
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
conservation easement amendments can
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
strengthen land protection goals
 
00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
while land trust should exercise caution
 
00:12:50.949 --> 00:12:50.959 align:start position:0%
and adhere to sound practices they
 
00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
should not fear entering into these
 
00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
agreements with landowners to ensure
 
00:12:56.389 --> 00:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
that easements would stand the test of
 
00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
time the use of amendments to
 
00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
conservation easements is expected to
 
00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.590 align:start position:0%
conservation easements is expected to
increase

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
increase
 
00:13:04.069 --> 00:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
as easements age protected land changes
 
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
hands and on the ground conditions
 
00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.150 align:start position:0%
hands and on the ground conditions
evolve

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
evolve
 
00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.750 align:start position:0%
evolve
so

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
there's 184 page treatise
 
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
online from the
 
00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
land trust alliance on how to change
 
00:13:21.269 --> 00:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
conservation easements
 
00:13:22.629 --> 00:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:13:24.389 --> 00:13:24.399 align:start position:0%
uh but if you can't get people to sit
 
00:13:26.069 --> 00:13:26.079 align:start position:0%
down and talk with you you can't make
 
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
the changes and that's what this bill
 
00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
intended to happen
 
00:13:29.279 --> 00:13:30.470 align:start position:0%
intended to happen
okay

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:13:34.949 --> 00:13:34.959 align:start position:0%
so we all got 20 or 30 letters um i got
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
flooded phone calls i'm sure many of you
 
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
got calls i talked to state reps i
 
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
talked to a lot of people
 
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
and the arguments and this is why we
 
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
need a study committee the arguments
 
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
are two basically
 
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
and they are not consistent with one
 
00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:52.550 align:start position:0%
and they are not consistent with one
another

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
on page one of a lot of these letters
 
00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
you get the argument
 
00:13:58.870 --> 00:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
conservation easements are perpetual
 
00:14:01.269 --> 00:14:01.279 align:start position:0%
they are written in letters of fire on
 
00:14:03.269 --> 00:14:03.279 align:start position:0%
tablets of stone and handed down from
 
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
mount sinai they shall not be changed
 
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
under any circumstances
 
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
that's page one page two is of course
 
00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
you can change these amendments just go
 
00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
talk to the attorney general's office
 
00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
and there's policies and procedures and
 
00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
methods to change these conservation
 
00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.030 align:start position:0%
methods to change these conservation
easements

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
easements
 
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:23.680 align:start position:0%
those two statements cannot exist in the
 
00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
same universe
 
00:14:27.829 --> 00:14:27.839 align:start position:0%
and that's the problem here
 
00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:29.519 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:14:31.509 --> 00:14:31.519 align:start position:0%
the word perpetual
 
00:14:34.629 --> 00:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
is being made equivalent to no changes
 
00:14:34.639 --> 00:14:36.069 align:start position:0%
is being made equivalent to no changes
whatsoever

00:14:36.069 --> 00:14:36.079 align:start position:0%
whatsoever
 
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
and that is not how the law is developed
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
either generally in property law really
 
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
much else in the law
 
00:14:44.629 --> 00:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:14:47.509 --> 00:14:47.519 align:start position:0%
i was told even by one person i said
 
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
well what if there was a drafting
 
00:14:49.199 --> 00:14:51.030 align:start position:0%
well what if there was a drafting
mistake

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
mistake
 
00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:52.720 align:start position:0%
what if they said 200 feet and they
 
00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:53.750 align:start position:0%
what if they said 200 feet and they
meant

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
meant
 
00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
200 yards
 
00:14:57.269 --> 00:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
nope can't change it
 
00:14:59.670 --> 00:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
you know once it's done it's done
 
00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
and we don't we're not interested in
 
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.509 align:start position:0%
and we don't we're not interested in
changing

00:15:03.509 --> 00:15:03.519 align:start position:0%
changing
 
00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:12.160 align:start position:0%
i got from the rockingham county
 
00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
conservation district probably sets it
 
00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:15.839 align:start position:0%
out best
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
our finite easement
 
00:15:20.389 --> 00:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
stewardship fund is designed for defense
 
00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
of these conservation easements not for
 
00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
amendment requests
 
00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
don't bother us with amendment requests
 
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
they take time effort money and we don't
 
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
really care
 
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
more than that
 
00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.230 align:start position:0%
more than that
so

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
the problem is as the west milan
 
00:15:42.069 --> 00:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
conservation commission said
 
00:15:42.079 --> 00:15:43.110 align:start position:0%
conservation commission said
that

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:46.720 align:start position:0%
refusing to even talk about making
 
00:15:48.389 --> 00:15:48.399 align:start position:0%
reasonable changes
 
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
discourages people from entering into
 
00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
conservation easements
 
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
and they're not going to want to do that
 
00:15:58.069 --> 00:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
if they feel like they can't even sit
 
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
down with government officials
 
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
so the purpose of having a study
 
00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:03.430 align:start position:0%
so the purpose of having a study
committee

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
i understand that the bill as is written
 
00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
is going to need to be revised
 
00:16:11.189 --> 00:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
there are legitimate
 
00:16:11.199 --> 00:16:12.230 align:start position:0%
there are legitimate
concerns

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
about what it covers what it doesn't
 
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.749 align:start position:0%
about what it covers what it doesn't
cover

00:16:15.749 --> 00:16:15.759 align:start position:0%
cover
 
00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
but if we can get everybody in a study
 
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
committee pointed in the same direction
 
00:16:22.389 --> 00:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
maybe we can take care of those
 
00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
um those early leases which are the ones
 
00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
we're talking about there might be a
 
00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
solution that says we can pass
 
00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
legislation that only covers
 
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
leases done before the change in the
 
00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
definition of of agriculture
 
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
we can do um a number of proposed
 
00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
solutions but i think we need to get
 
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
everybody in the study committee and um
 
00:16:48.629 --> 00:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
see what we can come up with
 
00:16:48.639 --> 00:16:49.590 align:start position:0%
see what we can come up with
so

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
with that i thank you
 
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony today are
 
00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
there questions for representative burch
 
00:16:59.110 --> 00:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
one last thing if i could
 
00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
and that is normally if we were in lob
 
00:17:04.949 --> 00:17:04.959 align:start position:0%
i would have asked permission of the
 
00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:08.079 align:start position:0%
chair to have alicia powell sit with me
 
00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:08.949 align:start position:0%
chair to have alicia powell sit with me
as

00:17:08.949 --> 00:17:08.959 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
the the person behind the bill i
 
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
couldn't do that obviously here
 
00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:15.839 align:start position:0%
but i want to make sure that the chair
 
00:17:17.909 --> 00:17:17.919 align:start position:0%
understands that she has a certain
 
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
presentation to give right she she has
 
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak and she will be
 
00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
called upon representative alexander did
 
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
you have a question
 
00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
um yes mr chair just more of a
 
00:17:29.669 --> 00:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
procedural question are we allowed to
 
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
open up a public hearing then move
 
00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
immediately move an amendment
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
or is that just is that just for the
 
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
exact session that that happens
 
00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:41.039 align:start position:0%
i don't actually think it's a motion i
 
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
at this point in time we're not in
 
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
executive session so i'm not sure that
 
00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
we're accepting motions i think the way
 
00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
i viewed it was that representative
 
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
burch had presented the bill but at this
 
00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
point in time
 
00:17:55.029 --> 00:17:55.039 align:start position:0%
uh realizing what the outcome might be
 
00:17:55.039 --> 00:17:55.830 align:start position:0%
uh realizing what the outcome might be
has

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:17:58.950 --> 00:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
indicated that he would prefer us to
 
00:18:01.029 --> 00:18:01.039 align:start position:0%
adopt an amendment to make it a study
 
00:18:01.039 --> 00:18:02.630 align:start position:0%
adopt an amendment to make it a study
community

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
um so the motion in the exact session
 
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
would not be and not to pass his
 
00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
amendment right away it would still be
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
00:18:14.549 --> 00:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's a motion to act on
 
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
i guess what i'm saying is i don't think
 
00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
there's a motion to act on right now
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
because we're not an executive session
 
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
all we have is a presentation by the
 
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
sponsor who has said that he would
 
00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
prefer to have
 
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
his bill
 
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
made into a study committee and he has
 
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
proposed that amendment and somebody in
 
00:18:37.029 --> 00:18:37.039 align:start position:0%
our executive session could offer that
 
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
amendment in a motion at the time
 
00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:50.789 --> 00:18:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
usually that's a good thing but i'll
 
00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
hear i'm unmuted um usually
 
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
this is the pretty routine thing that
 
00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
happens in hearings all the time but
 
00:18:59.830 --> 00:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
somebody brings the bill and that says
 
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
they're intending to offer a
 
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
an amendment sometimes amendments that
 
00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.029 align:start position:0%
an amendment sometimes amendments that
are

00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
much more difficult to summarize in the
 
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
study committee which uh you know
 
00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:10.720 align:start position:0%
something i think we all
 
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
can picture immediately when they say
 
00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
we're going to the study committee
 
00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
we've all seen those a million times but
 
00:19:18.789 --> 00:19:18.799 align:start position:0%
we've seen okay i certainly see
 
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes much more complicated
 
00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
amendments alluded to as happened with
 
00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
i presented to another committee
 
00:19:27.029 --> 00:19:27.039 align:start position:0%
yesterday so anyway
 
00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to say that mr chair i
 
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
don't see anything unusual in that
 
00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:31.430 align:start position:0%
don't see anything unusual in that
thanks

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative wolper
 
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
yes mr chairman uh representative first
 
00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.789 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:19:42.789 --> 00:19:42.799 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh i have a bunch of rough notes but
 
00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:46.799 align:start position:0%
they're really to the substance of the
 
00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
bill and since i've changed it to
 
00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:50.870 align:start position:0%
bill and since i've changed it to
[Music]

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
a study committee those are off the cuff
 
00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
so i don't have anything to submit
 
00:19:58.390 --> 00:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:19:59.669 --> 00:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
thank you is there are there any other
 
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
questions for representative birch
 
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you for your testimony
 
00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
we do have a number of people who have
 
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
signed up today to speak as i indicated
 
00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.230 align:start position:0%
signed up today to speak as i indicated
earlier

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
before we started the meeting
 
00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
there was only one person who signed it
 
00:20:19.669 --> 00:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
up in support and there were 286 people
 
00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
signed up in opposition
 
00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
to the bill
 
00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
as as it's written
 
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
so at this point in time where it
 
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
appears to me that we're really
 
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
discussing whether or not we should have
 
00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
a study
 
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
community and because we do have a
 
00:20:38.789 --> 00:20:38.799 align:start position:0%
number of people who have signed up to
 
00:20:38.799 --> 00:20:40.070 align:start position:0%
number of people who have signed up to
speak

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
speak
 
00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to limit the speakers if
 
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
they would
 
00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
to speak no more than three minutes
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
at a time so we can get through our
 
00:20:51.669 --> 00:20:51.679 align:start position:0%
hearing quickly and if the speakers
 
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
would more specifically address whether
 
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
there's a need for study i think that
 
00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
would be very helpful
 
00:20:59.510 --> 00:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
the first
 
00:21:02.149 --> 00:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
person is the uh person who was
 
00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned by representative burch and
 
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:12.549 --> 00:21:12.559 align:start position:0%
i'm available
 
00:21:12.559 --> 00:21:14.630 align:start position:0%
i'm available
okay

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
you can hear me okay
 
00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
we can okay
 
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
all right my name is alicia adams powell
 
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm speaking on behalf of my family
 
00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
here at wendyhurst farm in westmoreland
 
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
we are a multi-generational dairy farm
 
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
in cheshire county we're milking about
 
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
250 cows and we have a maple sugaring
 
00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
business as well as a restaurant where
 
00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
we serve our maple syrup and we use our
 
00:21:38.549 --> 00:21:38.559 align:start position:0%
own beef most of our farmland is
 
00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
protected under an easement that we
 
00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
entered into in 1988 we have a long
 
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
history of cooperation and collaboration
 
00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
with many conservation agencies in our
 
00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:48.549 align:start position:0%
with many conservation agencies in our
region

00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:48.559 align:start position:0%
region
 
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
we were named co-operator of the year in
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
2013 by the cheshire county conservation
 
00:21:52.559 --> 00:21:53.669 align:start position:0%
2013 by the cheshire county conservation
district

00:21:53.669 --> 00:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
this bill was written in response to our
 
00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
request for help in dealing with the
 
00:21:58.870 --> 00:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
matter that has come up recently and is
 
00:22:00.789 --> 00:22:00.799 align:start position:0%
adversely affecting our livelihood and
 
00:22:02.549 --> 00:22:02.559 align:start position:0%
future here on the farm
 
00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
we received a letter from stephen walker
 
00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
at the clsp in january of 2020 stating
 
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
that the use of our property to host
 
00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
cruise night events was a
 
00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:13.190 align:start position:0%
cruise night events was a
non-agriculture

00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
non-agriculture
 
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
use of conservation easement property
 
00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
and therefore not allowed
 
00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:19.919 align:start position:0%
cruise nights started in 2006. once a
 
00:22:21.669 --> 00:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
week during the summer people come from
 
00:22:23.669 --> 00:22:23.679 align:start position:0%
around the region and beyond with
 
00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
classic cars and parked them to display
 
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
in our field no changes updates or
 
00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
damage has happened to the land where
 
00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
this takes place no fee is charged for
 
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
this event it does spark local interest
 
00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
and has enhanced visitation to our sugar
 
00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
house and farm over the years
 
00:22:40.549 --> 00:22:40.559 align:start position:0%
the state argued that because the event
 
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
benefits our restaurant it is therefore
 
00:22:44.149 --> 00:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
considered to be a commercial use of the
 
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
property wendy harris farm partnership
 
00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
owns all the land in question and owns
 
00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
and operates the sugar house restaurant
 
00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
we first tried to handle this issue with
 
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
the help of legal counsel with
 
00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
communication back and forth between the
 
00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:57.590 align:start position:0%
communication back and forth between the
clsp

00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
clsp
 
00:22:59.909 --> 00:22:59.919 align:start position:0%
and the state ag's office we attempted
 
00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
mediation with stephen walker in the
 
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
clsp which is extremely unproductive
 
00:23:05.909 --> 00:23:05.919 align:start position:0%
even in trying to understand their
 
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
perspective on this issue and why after
 
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
15 years this event has now been
 
00:23:12.549 --> 00:23:12.559 align:start position:0%
disallowed we have reached out and
 
00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
discussed this issue with many state and
 
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
agricultural organizations uh
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner of agriculture sean jasper
 
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
suggested pursuit of a legislative
 
00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
solution as well as
 
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
chris aslin as you heard earlier stated
 
00:23:26.789 --> 00:23:26.799 align:start position:0%
to us in a letter short of legislative
 
00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
action to release the conserved property
 
00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
from the public trust or to approve a
 
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
land swap the clsp has no discretion to
 
00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
allow non-permitted commercial uses of
 
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
the easement
 
00:23:38.789 --> 00:23:38.799 align:start position:0%
as part of the discussion with the ag's
 
00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
office it had been at one point
 
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
suggested that a parcel of land that the
 
00:23:44.149 --> 00:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
farm had retained for a possible
 
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
building lot which was equal in size to
 
00:23:48.149 --> 00:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
the field in question could possibly be
 
00:23:48.159 --> 00:23:49.270 align:start position:0%
the field in question could possibly be
swapped

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:49.280 align:start position:0%
swapped
 
00:23:50.789 --> 00:23:50.799 align:start position:0%
at that point we discussed the matter
 
00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:52.640 align:start position:0%
with paul burch who agreed to help us
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
pursue this legislative action
 
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
while this bill was written to try to
 
00:23:58.390 --> 00:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
address this issue of being able to swap
 
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
an equal parcel of land in our easement
 
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
we understand that solution would be
 
00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
difficult to enact without opening up
 
00:24:06.149 --> 00:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
other issues related to other
 
00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
conservation easements to us the bigger
 
00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
issue here is in regard to land that is
 
00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
under a conservation easement in the
 
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire and had been
 
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
enacted prior to the state adopting an
 
00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
updated definition of agritourism when
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
our easement was enacted in 1988
 
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
agritourism was not well defined as part
 
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
of agriculture in the state of new
 
00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire the current definition of
 
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
agritourism as set forth in new
 
00:24:30.789 --> 00:24:30.799 align:start position:0%
hampshire state law
 
00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
reads as follows marketing shall include
 
00:24:35.269 --> 00:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
agritourism which means attracting
 
00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
visitors to a farm to attend events or
 
00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
activities that are accessory uses to
 
00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
the primary farm operation
 
00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
including but not limited to being
 
00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
providing provided a meal making
 
00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
overnight stays enjoyment of the farm
 
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
environment education which shall be
 
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
instruction or learning about the farm's
 
00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
operations or active involvement in the
 
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
activities on the farm
 
00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
farming and agriculture
 
00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
yeah and if you could just address the
 
00:25:05.269 --> 00:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
issue of whether or not you support the
 
00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
idea of having the study committee that
 
00:25:08.789 --> 00:25:08.799 align:start position:0%
would be appreciated
 
00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
okay we respectfully request that people
 
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
involved in conservation agriculture and
 
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
legislative leadership in the state will
 
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
work with us to find a way to allow
 
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
older easements such as ours to
 
00:25:20.149 --> 00:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
recognize and allow agritourism on our
 
00:25:21.909 --> 00:25:21.919 align:start position:0%
farms while being able to uphold the
 
00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
integrity of the conservation of
 
00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
agricultural lands
 
00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:28.720 align:start position:0%
so yes it would be great if it could be
 
00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
put into a study committee so that um
 
00:25:32.789 --> 00:25:32.799 align:start position:0%
you know there could be discussion about
 
00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
this issue um because otherwise we're
 
00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
we're not finding anyone to work with us
 
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
or help us in any way with an issue that
 
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
seems to be pretty common sense
 
00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.870 align:start position:0%
seems to be pretty common sense
okay

00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%

00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:46.799 align:start position:0%

received a letter from myself and from
 
00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
terry knowles who's the former assistant

director of the charitable trust unit of
 
00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
the office attorney general

she has extensive experience with
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
charitable trusts of all kinds including
 
00:27:09.909 --> 00:27:09.919 align:start position:0%
conservation easements defined as
 
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
charitable trust
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
she has advised public agencies towns
 
00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
and land trusts on a wide variety of
 
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
issues related to the interpretation
 
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement and amendment of
 
00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
conservation easements and she is the
 
00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:22.240 align:start position:0%
co-author of the document i just
 
00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned amending or terminating
 
00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
conservation easements in new hampshire
 
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh conforming to charitable trust
 
00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
requirements and as well as a law
 
00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh review article on the experience of
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
new hampshire in that regard
 
00:27:36.789 --> 00:27:36.799 align:start position:0%
i won't repeat what's in our letter
 
00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:38.720 align:start position:0%
because i believe that substance speaks
 
00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
to the substance of the idea of original
 
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill i'll simply say that
 
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
if there's to be a study committee i
 
00:27:48.149 --> 00:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
would recommend strongly that the
 
00:27:48.159 --> 00:27:49.269 align:start position:0%
would recommend strongly that the
committee

00:27:49.269 --> 00:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
seek the advice of those who have been
 
00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039 align:start position:0%
involved in the amendment process in new
 
00:27:53.039 --> 00:27:54.310 align:start position:0%
involved in the amendment process in new
hampshire

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
i participated in dozens of conservation
 
00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
easement amendment discussions some of
 
00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
which were easy some of which were
 
00:28:02.149 --> 00:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
difficult some of which were approved by
 
00:28:04.789 --> 00:28:04.799 align:start position:0%
the attorney general in its review by uh
 
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
in using the document i mentioned
 
00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
earlier and some of which were not
 
00:28:09.909 --> 00:28:09.919 align:start position:0%
approved because they were
 
00:28:12.389 --> 00:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
deemed inappropriate um
 
00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
then there will be others in this uh
 
00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:16.640 align:start position:0%
committee hearing who will address the
 
00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
specific legislative problem with the
 
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
easement at wendyhurst farm which was
 
00:28:24.149 --> 00:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
enacted through the lcip program in the
 
00:28:24.159 --> 00:28:25.590 align:start position:0%
enacted through the lcip program in the
1980s

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
1980s
 
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
which is unique to that program
 
00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
whereas other conservation easements in
 
00:28:32.789 --> 00:28:32.799 align:start position:0%
this state can be amended despite the
 
00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
fact that the documents are in put in
 
00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:36.389 align:start position:0%
fact that the documents are in put in
perpetuity

00:28:36.389 --> 00:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
perpetuity
 
00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh the concept of in perpetuity applies
 
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
to the fact that the easement itself
 
00:28:41.909 --> 00:28:41.919 align:start position:0%
runs in perpetuity there is a
 
00:28:44.549 --> 00:28:44.559 align:start position:0%
recognition today by all land
 
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
conservation organizations as well as
 
00:28:48.789 --> 00:28:48.799 align:start position:0%
the irs which oversees the tax
 
00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
deductibility of donated easements that
 
00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
easements amendments may sometimes be
 
00:28:55.269 --> 00:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
appropriate in very limited
 
00:28:57.669 --> 00:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
circumstances so i will end my
 
00:28:59.590 --> 00:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
discussion then i think you could read
 
00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
my letter there are some very specific
 
00:29:03.029 --> 00:29:03.039 align:start position:0%
details in there that we
 
00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
wanted you to be aware of but i will let
 
00:29:14.389 --> 00:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:16.480 align:start position:0%

go ahead ms snyder hello
 
00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
hello thank you uh for having me here
 
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
today um i wanted to i'm a member of the
 
00:30:24.389 --> 00:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
chester new hampshire conservation
 
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
commission and i did uh talk with uh
 
00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative burch on the phone
 
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
i will speak to the amendment um i was
 
00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
opposed to the original bill um i do
 
00:30:39.029 --> 00:30:39.039 align:start position:0%
support having a study committee
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
to make this short i will just pick up
 
00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
on a point
 
00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
though for future reference
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
that representative burke said that
 
00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
in his opening remarks
 
00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
that not make not being able to make
 
00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
amendments might encourage people not to
 
00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
enter easements i will say that as a
 
00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
member of a conservation commission i
 
00:31:03.909 --> 00:31:03.919 align:start position:0%
found that to be the actual opposite
 
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
when we talk to people about making um
 
00:31:09.669 --> 00:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
putting donations uh donating their land
 
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
and putting uh conservation easement on
 
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:12.710 align:start position:0%
and putting uh conservation easement on
it

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:31:15.269 --> 00:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
one of their biggest fears is that their
 
00:31:17.669 --> 00:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
wishes will be changed in the future
 
00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
they have uh they enter into contract in
 
00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
good faith that their wishes down the
 
00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
road decades down the road will be
 
00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
adhered to
 
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
and they are sometimes distrustful of
 
00:31:31.269 --> 00:31:31.279 align:start position:0%
government and if a bill um the way this
 
00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
original bill was written if that were
 
00:31:35.029 --> 00:31:35.039 align:start position:0%
to pass i think we would actually see
 
00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
less and less people inclined to donate
 
00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:38.710 align:start position:0%
less and less people inclined to donate
easements

00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
easements
 
00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
we ourselves donate an easement to the
 
00:31:44.549 --> 00:31:44.559 align:start position:0%
town and we put specific uh
 
00:31:47.909 --> 00:31:47.919 align:start position:0%
specific language in there to our wishes
 
00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:49.919 align:start position:0%
and if we thought that decades down the
 
00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
road that language would be changed and
 
00:31:54.789 --> 00:31:54.799 align:start position:0%
our wishes uh would change
 
00:31:58.470 --> 00:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
and new owners would um do the opposite
 
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
of what we would like to have had happen
 
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
on to our property we would probably not
 
00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
have donated the easement so when that
 
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
study committee if it does pass
 
00:32:10.789 --> 00:32:10.799 align:start position:0%
i hope that that's taken into
 
00:32:13.509 --> 00:32:13.519 align:start position:0%
consideration and that's all i have
 
00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:32:17.509 --> 00:32:17.519 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
sing none thank you for testifying today
 
00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.350 align:start position:0%
sing none thank you for testifying today

maslin after after mr maslin will call
 
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:34.549 --> 00:32:34.559 align:start position:0%
good morning can you hear me
 
00:32:35.509 --> 00:32:35.519 align:start position:0%
we can
 
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
yes good morning my name is thomas
 
00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
matsmond i'm an attorney
 
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
in concord
 
00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
i have been representing landowners and
 
00:32:46.149 --> 00:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
land trust and conservation easement
 
00:32:46.159 --> 00:32:47.590 align:start position:0%
land trust and conservation easement
transactions

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
transactions
 
00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
for over two decades
 
00:32:51.509 --> 00:32:51.519 align:start position:0%
i've been involved in a number of
 
00:32:53.669 --> 00:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
amendments both before
 
00:32:56.789 --> 00:32:56.799 align:start position:0%
the guidelines were established by the
 
00:32:59.350 --> 00:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office and since
 
00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
we need to recognize that in new
 
00:33:02.789 --> 00:33:02.799 align:start position:0%
hampshire conservation easements are
 
00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
dealt with as charitable trusts
 
00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
and that's an important consideration i
 
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
believe that the current system that mr
 
00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
dasher explained
 
00:33:14.549 --> 00:33:14.559 align:start position:0%
is working well through the guidelines
 
00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
uh adopted by the charitable trust unit
 
00:33:19.269 --> 00:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
of the attorney general's office
 
00:33:19.279 --> 00:33:20.389 align:start position:0%
of the attorney general's office
uh

00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
which requires a robust and rigorous
 
00:33:25.509 --> 00:33:25.519 align:start position:0%
review of amendment requests
 
00:33:28.389 --> 00:33:28.399 align:start position:0%
based upon guidelines established in
 
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
many many studies
 
00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
it works well
 
00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
and i will echo also what mr dash you
 
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
said in that if a study committee is to
 
00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
be formed that you reach out to those
 
00:33:40.389 --> 00:33:40.399 align:start position:0%
who have been involved in conservation
 
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
easement transactions
 
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
because there's a wealth of knowledge
 
00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
and information out there
 
00:33:48.549 --> 00:33:48.559 align:start position:0%
easements in new hampshire can be
 
00:33:48.559 --> 00:33:49.909 align:start position:0%
easements in new hampshire can be
amended

00:33:49.909 --> 00:33:49.919 align:start position:0%
amended
 
00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
we have a narrow situation here which
 
00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps could be solved without uh
 
00:33:57.669 --> 00:33:57.679 align:start position:0%
wholesale revision to our statutory
 
00:34:00.389 --> 00:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
schemes thank you very much
 
00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for your uh brief testimony
 
00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
much appreciated are there any questions
 
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
for mr maslin
 
00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:12.149 --> 00:34:12.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair just just a quick
 
00:34:15.669 --> 00:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
question so um because all these uh
 
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
easements are amendable is is the
 
00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
problem just with the l-chip easements
 
00:34:21.669 --> 00:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
and there's something different about
 
00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:24.230 align:start position:0%
and there's something different about
those

00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:25.589 --> 00:34:25.599 align:start position:0%
i think there is something different
 
00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:27.599 align:start position:0%
with the lcip's it's because of the
 
00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
statutory scheme under which that
 
00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
thank you as that's pre-l chip there's a
 
00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
difference between the lcip and lca
 
00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
any other questions for mr maslin
 
00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
attorney maslan
 
00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
if not
 
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
thanks for your testimony today thank
 
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.510 align:start position:0%
thanks for your testimony today thank

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:53.520 align:start position:0%

00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
barbara richter and
 
00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:57.839 align:start position:0%
and after we hear from
 
00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
okay well thank you very much for this
 
00:35:19.109 --> 00:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide comments on house
 
00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
bill 82
 
00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
my name is barbara richter and i'm the
 
00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
executive director of the new hampshire
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
association of conservation commissions
 
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
nhacc is a non-profit organization that
 
00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
serves 217 conservation commissions in
 
00:35:33.589 --> 00:35:33.599 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:35:35.109 --> 00:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
and we work with more than fifteen
 
00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
hundred volunteers committed to
 
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
protecting natural resources in their
 
00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:40.150 align:start position:0%
protecting natural resources in their
community

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
and i'd just like to point out that um
 
00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
towns in new hampshire do hold
 
00:35:47.589 --> 00:35:47.599 align:start position:0%
conservation easements and this bill as
 
00:35:47.599 --> 00:35:48.870 align:start position:0%
conservation easements and this bill as
written

00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
written
 
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
would cause
 
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of complicated lawsuits and would
 
00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
end up um
 
00:35:58.710 --> 00:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
being a great legal expense for a lot of
 
00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
communities and the reason why we were
 
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill is mainly because
 
00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
of that broad language that was included
 
00:36:09.589 --> 00:36:09.599 align:start position:0%
um the including but not limited to
 
00:36:09.599 --> 00:36:10.710 align:start position:0%
um the including but not limited to
and

00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
the term terminology to correct an
 
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
injustice for any reason that advances
 
00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
the public good
 
00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
because we have questions that you know
 
00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
is it an injustice to new hampshire
 
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
citizens when taxpayer dollars have been
 
00:36:25.589 --> 00:36:25.599 align:start position:0%
used to purchase an easement to then
 
00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
change the terms of the easement
 
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of questions regarding
 
00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
that and it's not that towns are not
 
00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
willing to discuss amendments or
 
00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
willing to consider
 
00:36:39.829 --> 00:36:39.839 align:start position:0%
landowner issues but under these broad
 
00:36:39.839 --> 00:36:41.510 align:start position:0%
landowner issues but under these broad
guidelines

00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
00:36:43.829 --> 00:36:43.839 align:start position:0%
it i think it would just be a legal
 
00:36:43.839 --> 00:36:44.950 align:start position:0%
it i think it would just be a legal
nightmare

00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
nightmare
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
so we do hope that when you are
 
00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
creating the study committee that you
 
00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
address these broader
 
00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
issues and make sure that you are
 
00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
following those guidelines
 
00:36:59.750 --> 00:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
as others have pointed out but the ag
 
00:37:01.829 --> 00:37:01.839 align:start position:0%
ag's office has established and in my
 
00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:03.599 align:start position:0%
letter i also sent a link to those
 
00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
guidelines because that process has been
 
00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
working well and i think that
 
00:37:11.829 --> 00:37:11.839 align:start position:0%
really keeps everybody on track and
 
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
aware of what's happening so
 
00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:15.750 align:start position:0%
aware of what's happening so
um

00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:17.109 --> 00:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
and i just like to point out just a
 
00:37:20.069 --> 00:37:20.079 align:start position:0%
couple more things real quickly
 
00:37:20.079 --> 00:37:21.430 align:start position:0%
couple more things real quickly
that

00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
conflict a bit with this this bill um
 
00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:28.069 align:start position:0%
conflict a bit with this this bill um
because

00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has already determined um
 
00:37:32.069 --> 00:37:32.079 align:start position:0%
natural aries to be in the public good
 
00:37:35.109 --> 00:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
if you look at rsa 79a it is hereby
 
00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
declared to be in the public interest to
 
00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
encourage the preservation of open space
 
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
thus providing a healthful and
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
attractive outdoor environment
 
00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:44.150 align:start position:0%
attractive outdoor environment
um

00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.349 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
if it's already a public good you know
 
00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
which public good to advance there's a
 
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
lot of questions here
 
00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
and the language of this bill really
 
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
provides no parameters or legal
 
00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
guidelines so it would just complicate
 
00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:00.069 align:start position:0%
guidelines so it would just complicate
issues

00:38:00.069 --> 00:38:00.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
and finally i just want to point out
 
00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
that nhacc supports farms we want to
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
make sure that they're productive and
 
00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:08.069 align:start position:0%
make sure that they're productive and
profitable

00:38:08.069 --> 00:38:08.079 align:start position:0%
profitable
 
00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
farms face many challenges today and
 
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
conservation easements continue to be a
 
00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
source of funds to help farmers plan for
 
00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
the future
 
00:38:18.069 --> 00:38:18.079 align:start position:0%
income from the sale of a conservation
 
00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
easement can be used to pay off farm
 
00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
debt invest in equipment and reduce
 
00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
mortgage or um purchase additional land
 
00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
um and with this
 
00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
finish up
 
00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
so i do um think that
 
00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
having too broad of a language that the
 
00:38:38.069 --> 00:38:38.079 align:start position:0%
towns will no longer want to hold
 
00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
easements and you're going to be
 
00:38:41.109 --> 00:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
limiting the opportunities for land
 
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
conservation for landowners so we hope
 
00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
that that's taken into consideration in
 
00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
the study bill we would certainly
 
00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
support a study bill if that's the
 
00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
direction this is heading thank you very
 
00:38:53.829 --> 00:38:53.839 align:start position:0%
much and i'd be happy to answer any
 
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
 
00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:03.750 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
today

00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:08.790 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:17.109 --> 00:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i appreciate the
 
00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak
 
00:39:20.069 --> 00:39:20.079 align:start position:0%
you can hear me
 
00:39:21.589 --> 00:39:21.599 align:start position:0%
we can
 
00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
my name is jack savage i'm the president
 
00:39:25.109 --> 00:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
of the society for the protection new
 
00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire for us
 
00:39:31.109 --> 00:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
we hold some 750 conservation easements
 
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
around the state covering about more
 
00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
than 130 000 acres
 
00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
and as paul dascher alluded to we were
 
00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
instrumental in
 
00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
making conservation easements possible
 
00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
back in the 1970s
 
00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:48.640 align:start position:0%
um here in new hampshire um we deal with
 
00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
easements that were written back then we
 
00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
deal with easements that were written
 
00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
um more recently you've received a
 
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
letter from us i won't read that or
 
00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
repeat that um
 
00:40:01.589 --> 00:40:01.599 align:start position:0%
uh you'll have that input in writing i
 
00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
did want to point out that that the bill
 
00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
as proposed
 
00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:07.800 align:start position:0%
addressed rsa
 
00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
477-46 and
 
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
as we address this issue as a state we
 
00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
want to look at rsa 162 c10 as well
 
00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
which i think is something that
 
00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:21.030 align:start position:0%
which i think is something that
specifically

00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
limits the number of changes that one of
 
00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
these lcip easements
 
00:40:27.109 --> 00:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
can do
 
00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
if if this goes to study committee i
 
00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
think you need to take a broad look at
 
00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:36.069 align:start position:0%
think you need to take a broad look at
what

00:40:36.069 --> 00:40:36.079 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
the existing law and whether there's an
 
00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide
 
00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
a reasonable process for considering an
 
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
amendment of an lcip easement um the
 
00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
bill of sales also has a number of
 
00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
bring the irs into it and to what extent
 
00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:56.150 align:start position:0%
bring the irs into it and to what extent
a

00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:40:57.910 --> 00:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
donated easement
 
00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
might be deductible by the irs if it's
 
00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
if the ability to
 
00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
amend it is too broad and without a
 
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
rigorous process
 
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
there's an issue about whether
 
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
the funding mechanisms the federal
 
00:41:16.309 --> 00:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
funding agencies if if the ability to
 
00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
amend is too broad would in fact
 
00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
continue funding agricultural easements
 
00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:22.640 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't be in the
 
00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
favor of
 
00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:25.430 align:start position:0%
favor of
future

00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
future
 
00:41:27.109 --> 00:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
farmers who are looking to make use of
 
00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
and i would remind that every amendment
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
is based on a specific easement and you
 
00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:38.720 align:start position:0%
have to look at the language in that
 
00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:39.750 align:start position:0%
have to look at the language in that
easement

00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
easement
 
00:41:42.069 --> 00:41:42.079 align:start position:0%
and even if there is the ability to
 
00:41:45.349 --> 00:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
amend the answer may still be no the
 
00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
intent of the original easement may be
 
00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
more important than a changing
 
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
definition of agriculture so it really
 
00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
comes down to looking specifically
 
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
easement and answer your question we
 
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
would be in favor of a study committee
 
00:41:57.990 --> 00:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
as long as it includes input from
 
00:41:59.750 --> 00:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
stakeholders among the conservation
 
00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:01.030 align:start position:0%
stakeholders among the conservation
community

00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
that deal with easement amendment issues
 
00:42:07.589 --> 00:42:07.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
 
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
if not again thank you for your
 
00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
testimony today
 
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
paul suska and then he'll be followed by
 
00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:29.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:31.589 --> 00:42:31.599 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chair and members of the
 
00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
committee i'm paul suska from the
 
00:42:36.069 --> 00:42:36.079 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services
 
00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
where we have programs that fund land
 
00:42:39.829 --> 00:42:39.839 align:start position:0%
conservation to protect important
 
00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
resources specifically water supplies
 
00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
and wetlands
 
00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
des has concerns about hb 82 as
 
00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:49.349 align:start position:0%
des has concerns about hb 82 as
introduced

00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
our concerns are outlined in our
 
00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
testimony letter
 
00:42:54.069 --> 00:42:54.079 align:start position:0%
we're not taking a position on the
 
00:42:55.829 --> 00:42:55.839 align:start position:0%
amendment but we would be happy to work
 
00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
with the study committee to craft a
 
00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:58.710 align:start position:0%
with the study committee to craft a
solution

00:42:58.710 --> 00:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
solution
 
00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
that addresses the sponsor's concerns to
 
00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
the exp
 
00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
to the extent possible
 
00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
without harming the departments and the
 
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
state's interests in resource protection
 
00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony today uh
 
00:43:21.589 --> 00:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none again thank you and judith
 
00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:47.589 --> 00:43:47.599 align:start position:0%
well i learned long ago that every time
 
00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
i engage in conversation with my dear
 
00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
friend representative burch i better be
 
00:43:55.109 --> 00:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
prepared to be fast on my feet
 
00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
and once again i was not aware that he
 
00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
was going to propose this amendment but
 
00:44:03.109 --> 00:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
i greatly respect
 
00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
the knowledge
 
00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
and insight that has gone into his
 
00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
decision to make this a study committee
 
00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
i was going to testify as a landowner
 
00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
who has conference conservation
 
00:44:19.109 --> 00:44:19.119 align:start position:0%
easements and
 
00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
the fact that we understand that there
 
00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
are certain uses we have reserve certain
 
00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:26.720 align:start position:0%
uses in our easements
 
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
we can't always look ahead to know that
 
00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
the neighbor is going to want to run a
 
00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
line across our our land
 
00:44:36.309 --> 00:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
so that isn't accounted for and we
 
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
understand that ultimately decisions
 
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
will be allowed on our easement and what
 
00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
will not
 
00:44:45.829 --> 00:44:45.839 align:start position:0%
all hinge on the resource values
 
00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
that both we and the
 
00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
organization that are helping us want to
 
00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:53.510 align:start position:0%
organization that are helping us want to
protect

00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
protect
 
00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
so i don't think that you know lando can
 
00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:58.079 align:start position:0%
chafe underneath
 
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
their the restrictions that they find
 
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
themselves under
 
00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:04.640 align:start position:0%
but i think if the landowner keeps in
 
00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
mind there was a reason that they wanted
 
00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
to put this easement in there's likely
 
00:45:11.589 --> 00:45:11.599 align:start position:0%
to be fewer problems
 
00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
in term i've been the chair of multiple
 
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
study committees and study commissions
 
00:45:19.829 --> 00:45:19.839 align:start position:0%
over my 20 years in the house
 
00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
and i have one piece of
 
00:45:26.309 --> 00:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
input that i like would like to make i
 
00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
would like for that study to committee
 
00:45:30.309 --> 00:45:30.319 align:start position:0%
to have
 
00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
some parameters around which they're
 
00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
going to do their work
 
00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
for example
 
00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
um i became very concerned with talk to
 
00:45:41.349 --> 00:45:41.359 align:start position:0%
representative burch
 
00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
about how farm easements are written and
 
00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
as a board member of l-ship
 
00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
um and having worked to get easements on
 
00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
palm is i realized that this is a very
 
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
unique kind of situation where those
 
00:45:58.950 --> 00:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
easements have to be different
 
00:46:02.069 --> 00:46:02.079 align:start position:0%
our the easement on our 100 acres was
 
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
obtained through federal funding that's
 
00:46:07.349 --> 00:46:07.359 align:start position:0%
a whole other issue
 
00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
some it's through state funding some is
 
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
through private donations all of those
 
00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:16.160 align:start position:0%
are specific issues
 
00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
that need to be addressed and i think
 
00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
that in
 
00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
designing this study committee
 
00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
we have to decide
 
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
which of those issues we're going to
 
00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
concentrate on or how we're going to
 
00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
prioritize them
 
00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of what we're going to address
 
00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
so we have plenty of experts that we're
 
00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
going to we're hearing from now who can
 
00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
help to design that study so we get the
 
00:46:45.829 --> 00:46:45.839 align:start position:0%
most out of it um going forward
 
00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
if you could just
 
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
wrap up your testimony that would be
 
00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:50.710 align:start position:0%
wrap up your testimony that would be
appreciated

00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:50.720 align:start position:0%
appreciated
 
00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
chairman gordon you got it
 
00:46:57.670 --> 00:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
okay i am wrapped thank you very much
 
00:46:59.750 --> 00:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank thank you for your testimony and
 
00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
seeing none again thank you for your
 
00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
testimony today
 
00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:09.280 align:start position:0%
i see i do have one person on the
 
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
attendee list with their hand up and
 
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
that's tom donovan from
 
00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:47:33.109 --> 00:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
um good morning my name is tom donovan
 
00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
i'm the director of charitable trusts at
 
00:47:37.109 --> 00:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office
 
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
um and i want to just speak uh briefly i
 
00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
support uh this bill going to the study
 
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
committee i think there some good could
 
00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
get out of it
 
00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:46.630 align:start position:0%
get out of it
um

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:48.309 --> 00:47:48.319 align:start position:0%
ours is the office that you've been
 
00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
hearing about it's the one that reviews
 
00:47:52.950 --> 00:47:52.960 align:start position:0%
proposed amendments to conservation
 
00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:54.069 align:start position:0%
proposed amendments to conservation
easements

00:47:54.069 --> 00:47:54.079 align:start position:0%
easements
 
00:47:56.870 --> 00:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
we get about 15 to 20 such requests
 
00:47:59.430 --> 00:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
every year
 
00:48:02.069 --> 00:48:02.079 align:start position:0%
and you've heard from others that
 
00:48:04.069 --> 00:48:04.079 align:start position:0%
you know some sometimes they go well
 
00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes they don't go well but we give
 
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
each one
 
00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:09.270 align:start position:0%
each one
consideration

00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:10.640 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:48:13.109 --> 00:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
this easement is complicated because
 
00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
it's an old lcip easement
 
00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
and there are two flavors of trusts
 
00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
involved in this easement
 
00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
one is
 
00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
the public trust which is written into
 
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
the lcip statute and that easement
 
00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
and that puts a restriction that the
 
00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
staff at the
 
00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
conservation land stewardship program
 
00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
can't simply change uh an easement that
 
00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:45.599 align:start position:0%
was granted using state funds under the
 
00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
lcip program that's why a legislative
 
00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:49.829 align:start position:0%
lcip program that's why a legislative
fix

00:48:49.829 --> 00:48:49.839 align:start position:0%
fix
 
00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
relating to that part may be in order
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:59.109 --> 00:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
a narrow bill might be able to address
 
00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
it the other flavor of trust is
 
00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
charitable trust
 
00:49:06.069 --> 00:49:06.079 align:start position:0%
and that applies to any conservation
 
00:49:07.349 --> 00:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
easement where
 
00:49:11.829 --> 00:49:11.839 align:start position:0%
there was a donation in whole or in part
 
00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
and most conservation easements fall
 
00:49:15.109 --> 00:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
into that
 
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
and if there's a charitable trust then
 
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with property rights and
 
00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
that's frankly not the the role of the
 
00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:22.790 align:start position:0%
that's frankly not the the role of the
legislature

00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:23.750 align:start position:0%
legislature
um

00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:24.470 align:start position:0%
um
if

00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:25.430 align:start position:0%
if
uh

00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
if there is something that our office
 
00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
cannot address then the uh place to go
 
00:49:34.069 --> 00:49:34.079 align:start position:0%
is to uh
 
00:49:37.109 --> 00:49:37.119 align:start position:0%
to a court so i don't want uh folks to
 
00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
think that just a legislative fix
 
00:49:44.549 --> 00:49:44.559 align:start position:0%
is going to um get windyhurst farm
 
00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
is going to solve all their problems
 
00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
there is a process in our office as well
 
00:49:52.309 --> 00:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
that would uh be able to address the
 
00:49:53.829 --> 00:49:53.839 align:start position:0%
charitable trust and i'd be happy to
 
00:49:55.829 --> 00:49:55.839 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:05.109 --> 00:50:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:07.589 --> 00:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you mr donovan
 
00:50:09.349 --> 00:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
i something came up in an earlier
 
00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
testimony and i think you might be the
 
00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
right person to answer this question for
 
00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:16.549 align:start position:0%
right person to answer this question for
me

00:50:16.549 --> 00:50:16.559 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
somewhere we were hearing in the
 
00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:20.240 align:start position:0%
testimony that the um
 
00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
that your office
 
00:50:24.309 --> 00:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
was not able to
 
00:50:26.069 --> 00:50:26.079 align:start position:0%
include the newer definition of
 
00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
agriculture in your reflection on this
 
00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
particular easement and i just wondered
 
00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
if that was
 
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
why that why that was
 
00:50:38.230 --> 00:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
yeah um representative simpson that's a
 
00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
good question i i think they might be
 
00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:42.200 align:start position:0%
referring to the
 
00:50:45.349 --> 00:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
conservation land stewardship program
 
00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
and it may be that there is specific
 
00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
language in that easement
 
00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
as recorded
 
00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:53.589 align:start position:0%
as recorded
that

00:50:53.589 --> 00:50:53.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:50:56.069 --> 00:50:56.079 align:start position:0%
might not be able to evolve with the
 
00:50:58.870 --> 00:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
change in the definition of agriculture
 
00:51:01.349 --> 00:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
um i haven't seen the deed so i can't
 
00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
comment on it
 
00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:03.670 align:start position:0%
comment on it

00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:03.680 align:start position:0%

00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:08.309 --> 00:51:08.319 align:start position:0%
there's always a deed that you have to
 
00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:13.680 align:start position:0%

00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
nature conservancy here in new hampshire
 
00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
and i promise i will be brief as i i did
 
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
submit written testimony so i will touch
 
00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
on just a couple of of facets and i will
 
00:51:53.349 --> 00:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
speak to the study committee as well so
 
00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
um just so you are all aware since 1961
 
00:51:58.470 --> 00:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
the nature conservancy in new hampshire
 
00:52:00.390 --> 00:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
has worked with both partners and
 
00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
landowners to protect more than 294
 
00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
thousand acres in new hampshire and um
 
00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
just to keep it brief you have all heard
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
um the reasons why this bill is a bad
 
00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
bill and we certainly oppose the bill as
 
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
originally intended we also opposed the
 
00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
study committee um and our reasoning
 
00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
behind that is just the office of the
 
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
attorney general already has a clear and
 
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
well-established process to amend
 
00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:28.640 align:start position:0%
easements when complications arise and
 
00:52:31.270 --> 00:52:31.280 align:start position:0%

non-disparagement clauses in settlement
 
00:54:58.390 --> 00:54:58.400 align:start position:0%

00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:04.069 align:start position:0%
a
small

00:55:04.069 --> 00:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
small
 
00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
amendment that has been filed which i
 
00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
don't seem to have in front of me
 
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
which would uh
 
00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:11.510 align:start position:0%
which would uh
uh

00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
change the language to simply
 
00:55:16.870 --> 00:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
have it as a claim
 
00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:17.990 align:start position:0%
have it as a claim
by

00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:20.720 align:start position:0%
or against the government so it goes in
 
00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
both directions
 
00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
and with that i'd like to speak to the
 
00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
bill with the minor amendment
 
00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
yep go ahead
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:55:34.870 --> 00:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
um basically what this bill does
 
00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:35.910 align:start position:0%
um basically what this bill does
is

00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:55:39.109 --> 00:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
says that if there's a settlement
 
00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
of a claim involving a government body
 
00:55:47.109 --> 00:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
that settlement cannot include a clause
 
00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
that prohibits the party from discussing
 
00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:52.559 align:start position:0%
the facts of the claim or speaking
 
00:55:56.549 --> 00:55:56.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:59.030 --> 00:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
this bill does not apply
 
00:56:02.470 --> 00:56:02.480 align:start position:0%
to public to private suits which do not
 
00:56:04.789 --> 00:56:04.799 align:start position:0%
involve government actors and i think if
 
00:56:07.109 --> 00:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
you look at the uh
 
00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
at two chairs versus three chairs you'll
 
00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
understand a little better what this
 
00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
bill is about
 
00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:14.390 align:start position:0%
bill is about
if

00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
if i crash my car into a neighbor's car
 
00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:18.470 align:start position:0%
if i crash my car into a neighbor's car
and

00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
she sues me
 
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:21.030 align:start position:0%
she sues me
that's

00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:56:24.150 --> 00:56:24.160 align:start position:0%
two people involved in a lawsuit we
 
00:56:26.069 --> 00:56:26.079 align:start position:0%
reach an agreement we can have whatever
 
00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
terms we like uh in terms of how we
 
00:56:30.309 --> 00:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
settle it you can look at it as two
 
00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
chairs one's my neighbor one's me we
 
00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
resolve our suit
 
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
what this bill deals with are three
 
00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:38.150 align:start position:0%
what this bill deals with are three
chairs

00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
chairs
 
00:56:40.069 --> 00:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
and these are suits involving the
 
00:56:42.309 --> 00:56:42.319 align:start position:0%
government and the third chair
 
00:56:45.829 --> 00:56:45.839 align:start position:0%
basically is that of the public
 
00:56:49.109 --> 00:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
and if we understand that there's three
 
00:56:51.030 --> 00:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
chairs at the table we'll understand
 
00:56:53.430 --> 00:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
some of the conversation about this bill
 
00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:54.390 align:start position:0%
some of the conversation about this bill
better

00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:56:56.950 --> 00:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
there's already a statute we have that
 
00:56:59.670 --> 00:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
requires the terms of the settlement
 
00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
to be a public record
 
00:57:04.309 --> 00:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
but that's been a very little use if the
 
00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
parties cannot talk about what actually
 
00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:07.589 align:start position:0%
parties cannot talk about what actually
happened

00:57:07.589 --> 00:57:07.599 align:start position:0%
happened
 
00:57:10.309 --> 00:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
why this bill
 
00:57:12.549 --> 00:57:12.559 align:start position:0%
a little while ago actually by now a
 
00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
couple years ago i was reading an
 
00:57:16.789 --> 00:57:16.799 align:start position:0%
article and i think it was a concord
 
00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
monitor i'm not sure
 
00:57:20.950 --> 00:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
um that
 
00:57:23.109 --> 00:57:23.119 align:start position:0%
related how a reporter was trying to do
 
00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
an article about a number of fairly
 
00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
large settlements involving misconduct
 
00:57:31.109 --> 00:57:31.119 align:start position:0%
at one of our county jails
 
00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
and the reporter went
 
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
from one
 
00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
plaintiff or victim to another to
 
00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:39.270 align:start position:0%
plaintiff or victim to another to
another

00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:57:41.670 --> 00:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
and it kept being told i would like to
 
00:57:43.349 --> 00:57:43.359 align:start position:0%
talk to you about what happened to me
 
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
we'd like to talk to you about what
 
00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:46.240 align:start position:0%
happened to our family member
 
00:57:48.390 --> 00:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
but if we say a word we're going to lose
 
00:57:50.549 --> 00:57:50.559 align:start position:0%
our settlement
 
00:57:50.559 --> 00:57:51.510 align:start position:0%
our settlement
and

00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:57:54.309 --> 00:57:54.319 align:start position:0%
that's a problem it's a national problem
 
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
and it's a problem here
 
00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
in uh in new hampshire this is a
 
00:58:02.069 --> 00:58:02.079 align:start position:0%
similar bill it might be identical bill
 
00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:04.640 align:start position:0%
that was passed by the house
 
00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
in the past term by voice vote
 
00:58:08.870 --> 00:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
in the u.s
 
00:58:11.430 --> 00:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
civil trials are disappearing
 
00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:14.240 align:start position:0%
instead of litigating disputes in court
 
00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:16.640 align:start position:0%
parties have increasingly turned to
 
00:58:19.349 --> 00:58:19.359 align:start position:0%
settlements and other avenues of dispute
 
00:58:19.359 --> 00:58:20.630 align:start position:0%
settlements and other avenues of dispute
resolution

00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
one result of this credit is this is
 
00:58:25.270 --> 00:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
that systemic discrimination
 
00:58:26.789 --> 00:58:26.799 align:start position:0%
and other harms that might have been
 
00:58:28.710 --> 00:58:28.720 align:start position:0%
revealed to the public
 
00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
in public trials have been obscured
 
00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
through sealed settlements
 
00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
and non-disparagement provisions
 
00:58:37.750 --> 00:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
such provisions are not uncommon
 
00:58:39.990 --> 00:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
in baltimore because it was a big case
 
00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
in baltimore which i will mention
 
00:58:44.549 --> 00:58:44.559 align:start position:0%
baltimore has inserted non-disparagement
 
00:58:47.109 --> 00:58:47.119 align:start position:0%
clauses in 95 percent
 
00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
of recent settlement agreements
 
00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
with plaintiffs that have alleged police
 
00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
misconduct 95 percent
 
00:58:56.230 --> 00:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
the victims cannot talk about what
 
00:58:58.390 --> 00:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
happened to them at a risk of losing
 
00:59:00.069 --> 00:59:00.079 align:start position:0%
their settlement
 
00:59:02.069 --> 00:59:02.079 align:start position:0%
one of the core values of the first
 
00:59:02.079 --> 00:59:03.670 align:start position:0%
one of the core values of the first
amendment

00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:59:05.910 --> 00:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
is to promote public understanding
 
00:59:07.349 --> 00:59:07.359 align:start position:0%
through free speech
 
00:59:09.670 --> 00:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
of the workings of our government
 
00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
as the supreme court noted in lane
 
00:59:13.109 --> 00:59:13.119 align:start position:0%
versus frank
 
00:59:15.349 --> 00:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
speech by citizens on matters of public
 
00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
concern lies at the heart of the first
 
00:59:20.309 --> 00:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
amendment which was fashioned to ensure
 
00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
unfettered exchange of ideas for the
 
00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
bringing about a political and social
 
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
changes desired by the people
 
00:59:28.870 --> 00:59:28.880 align:start position:0%
we've made it clear that the core first
 
00:59:30.390 --> 00:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
amendment concern
 
00:59:32.789 --> 00:59:32.799 align:start position:0%
is the actual workings not just the
 
00:59:35.109 --> 00:59:35.119 align:start position:0%
speeches reports and handouts of our
 
00:59:36.870 --> 00:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
public bodies
 
00:59:38.950 --> 00:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
in 2019
 
00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
in over b versus mayor of baltimore
 
00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
the fourth circuit found that the first
 
00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
amendment prohibited the enforcement of
 
00:59:49.349 --> 00:59:49.359 align:start position:0%
a settlement agreement between the civil
 
00:59:51.270 --> 00:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
rights plaintiff and the city of
 
00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
baltimore based on these first amendment
 
00:59:56.710 --> 00:59:56.720 align:start position:0%
core values it was a suit brought by the
 
00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:58.470 align:start position:0%
core values it was a suit brought by the
aclu

00:59:58.470 --> 00:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
aclu
 
01:00:01.109 --> 01:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
and the court noted
 
01:00:03.349 --> 01:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
that it wanted
 
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
it it didn't approve
 
01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
of the government using its power to
 
01:00:10.950 --> 01:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
curb speech not to its liking
 
01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:12.829 align:start position:0%
curb speech not to its liking
and

01:00:12.829 --> 01:00:12.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:00:16.470 --> 01:00:16.480 align:start position:0%
uh that is uh
 
01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:17.430 align:start position:0%
uh that is uh
why

01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
this litigation exists
 
01:00:21.349 --> 01:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
we will hear
 
01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
and you may have read there's an
 
01:00:24.549 --> 01:00:24.559 align:start position:0%
objection saying this is going to
 
01:00:27.270 --> 01:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
increase the cost of litigation
 
01:00:29.829 --> 01:00:29.839 align:start position:0%
uh somehow that if
 
01:00:29.839 --> 01:00:30.630 align:start position:0%
uh somehow that if
if

01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:30.640 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:00:32.789 --> 01:00:32.799 align:start position:0%
you can't have secret settlements cost
 
01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
litigation is going to go up
 
01:00:37.030 --> 01:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
that's been widely discredited
 
01:00:38.789 --> 01:00:38.799 align:start position:0%
it's promoted but it's widely
 
01:00:38.799 --> 01:00:40.150 align:start position:0%
it's promoted but it's widely
discredited

01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
discredited
 
01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
first of all from the courts have
 
01:00:43.349 --> 01:00:43.359 align:start position:0%
discredited that
 
01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
from the oberbee case
 
01:00:47.430 --> 01:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
we are troubled by the underlying logic
 
01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
of this assertion police misconduct
 
01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
claimants get money to keep quiet the
 
01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
city gets silence and expedient
 
01:00:57.430 --> 01:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
litigation and everybody wins except
 
01:00:59.829 --> 01:00:59.839 align:start position:0%
presumably members of the public who are
 
01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
interested in transparency surrounding
 
01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
police misconduct suits
 
01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
aside from that concern they're two
 
01:01:07.670 --> 01:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
factors that make the city's assertion
 
01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:09.510 align:start position:0%
factors that make the city's assertion
unconvincing

01:01:09.510 --> 01:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
unconvincing
 
01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
first the assertion is overly simple
 
01:01:13.510 --> 01:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
the outcome of settlements and
 
01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:15.109 align:start position:0%
the outcome of settlements and
negotiations

01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
negotiations
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
in a police misconduct suit is likely to
 
01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
be driven by complex interactions
 
01:01:21.589 --> 01:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
case-specific factors
 
01:01:23.670 --> 01:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
such as the defendant's risk of exposure
 
01:01:26.069 --> 01:01:26.079 align:start position:0%
to high damages the claims financial
 
01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
resources besides appetite for for
 
01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:29.910 align:start position:0%
resources besides appetite for for
litigation

01:01:29.910 --> 01:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
litigation
 
01:01:31.829 --> 01:01:31.839 align:start position:0%
therefore we will not assume that the
 
01:01:31.839 --> 01:01:33.190 align:start position:0%
therefore we will not assume that the
financial

01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:33.200 align:start position:0%
financial
 
01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
terms of future settlement will be
 
01:01:37.950 --> 01:01:37.960 align:start position:0%
affected by the enforceability of
 
01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
non-disparagement agreements
 
01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:41.670 align:start position:0%
non-disparagement agreements
okay

01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
i will
 
01:01:45.990 --> 01:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
note that a scholarly study compared
 
01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
the uh the costs of the
 
01:01:51.589 --> 01:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
settlements in
 
01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
states that have this versus the
 
01:01:55.030 --> 01:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
settlement in the case states that don't
 
01:01:57.190 --> 01:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
found no appreciable difference
 
01:01:58.789 --> 01:01:58.799 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:02:02.230 --> 01:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
i know we're falling behind so i will
 
01:02:04.829 --> 01:02:04.839 align:start position:0%
end my comments at that point at this
 
01:02:07.349 --> 01:02:07.359 align:start position:0%
point thank you are there any questions
 
01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:16.549 --> 01:02:16.559 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
representative birth for taking my
 
01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:20.150 align:start position:0%
representative birth for taking my
question

01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:22.549 align:start position:0%
question
so

01:02:22.549 --> 01:02:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:25.030 --> 01:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
is a non-disclosure stipulation
 
01:02:29.349 --> 01:02:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:32.309 --> 01:02:32.319 align:start position:0%
and in many respects it is
 
01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
it we're talking here only about
 
01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
ability to talk about the case and just
 
01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
quote disparage the other side and it
 
01:02:49.030 --> 01:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:49.910 align:start position:0%
 
other

01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:02:53.829 --> 01:02:53.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:59.430 --> 01:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:06.559 align:start position:0%
if this was uh changed and people were
 
01:03:08.230 --> 01:03:08.240 align:start position:0%
able to talk do you think that's going
 
01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:15.270 align:start position:0%
 
probably

01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
probably
 
01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:16.470 align:start position:0%
probably
not

01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:17.910 align:start position:0%
not
um

01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:19.589 --> 01:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
i did settlements
 
01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:22.559 align:start position:0%
in in in the world of of criminal
 
01:03:22.559 --> 01:03:23.910 align:start position:0%
in in in the world of of criminal
prosecution

01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
prosecution
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
and criminal cases
 
01:03:29.349 --> 01:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
all of those cases are public
 
01:03:29.359 --> 01:03:30.549 align:start position:0%
all of those cases are public
and

01:03:30.549 --> 01:03:30.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:30.559 --> 01:03:32.549 align:start position:0%
and
95

01:03:32.549 --> 01:03:32.559 align:start position:0%
95
 
01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
of those cases are resolved in by
 
01:03:38.069 --> 01:03:38.079 align:start position:0%
negotiation about five percent go to
 
01:03:41.829 --> 01:03:41.839 align:start position:0%
trial 95 are negotiated in the light of
 
01:03:41.839 --> 01:03:42.789 align:start position:0%
trial 95 are negotiated in the light of
day

01:03:42.789 --> 01:03:42.799 align:start position:0%
day
 
01:03:45.270 --> 01:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
and those negotiations go on rapidly
 
01:03:48.069 --> 01:03:48.079 align:start position:0%
they go on quickly they go on every day
 
01:03:50.789 --> 01:03:50.799 align:start position:0%
in in every court pretty much in the
 
01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
united states that handles criminal
 
01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
cases so the idea that you have to have
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
cases done in secret in order to achieve
 
01:04:02.069 --> 01:04:02.079 align:start position:0%
settlement just you know just isn't true
 
01:04:02.079 --> 01:04:03.109 align:start position:0%
settlement just you know just isn't true
okay

01:04:03.109 --> 01:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:04:06.309 --> 01:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:13.589 --> 01:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um so you talked
 
01:04:18.549 --> 01:04:18.559 align:start position:0%
about the um the cost of litigation
 
01:04:20.309 --> 01:04:20.319 align:start position:0%
argument increase argument is
 
01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
discredited um you mentioned a little
 
01:04:24.390 --> 01:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
bit about like earlier settlement do you
 
01:04:26.789 --> 01:04:26.799 align:start position:0%
think that this bill would prevent an
 
01:04:28.549 --> 01:04:28.559 align:start position:0%
earlier settlement
 
01:04:31.589 --> 01:04:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:31.599 --> 01:04:33.029 align:start position:0%
 
no

01:04:33.029 --> 01:04:33.039 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
people settle for a number of reasons
 
01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:36.829 align:start position:0%
people settle for a number of reasons
um

01:04:36.829 --> 01:04:36.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
cases tend to go to trial if there's a
 
01:04:44.789 --> 01:04:44.799 align:start position:0%
dispute about facts or dispute about law
 
01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
if there isn't you know then people will
 
01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
tend to to reach what best best
 
01:04:51.349 --> 01:04:51.359 align:start position:0%
agreement they can reach
 
01:04:51.359 --> 01:04:52.710 align:start position:0%
agreement they can reach
um

01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:54.549 --> 01:04:54.559 align:start position:0%
the speed of settlement often depends on
 
01:04:57.029 --> 01:04:57.039 align:start position:0%
the court how fast the court pushes it
 
01:04:59.510 --> 01:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
along forces uh
 
01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:00.390 align:start position:0%
along forces uh
uh

01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
decisions made at the courthouse door
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:10.150 --> 01:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
01:05:12.789 --> 01:05:12.799 align:start position:0%
representative mclean
 
01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question so
 
01:05:19.510 --> 01:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that um other states
 
01:05:22.549 --> 01:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
are already going down this path
 
01:05:22.559 --> 01:05:23.430 align:start position:0%
are already going down this path
so

01:05:23.430 --> 01:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
how broad is that are we talking lots of
 
01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
states and how long is this is this a
 
01:05:30.390 --> 01:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
relatively new thing or has it been
 
01:05:33.589 --> 01:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
going on for quite some time
 
01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
it's been going on quite some time i
 
01:05:37.829 --> 01:05:37.839 align:start position:0%
don't have the numbers there there are
 
01:05:39.990 --> 01:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
some experts that may be testifying
 
01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:40.870 align:start position:0%
some experts that may be testifying
later

01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
later
 
01:05:42.789 --> 01:05:42.799 align:start position:0%
uh in this hearing that may have more
 
01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
information than i do
 
01:05:48.549 --> 01:05:48.559 align:start position:0%
uh about the breadth of it uh so i don't
 
01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
have that information it is uh
 
01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:53.349 align:start position:0%
have that information it is uh
um

01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:53.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:55.990 --> 01:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
non-disclosure agreements non-uh
 
01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:57.839 align:start position:0%
disparagement agreements
 
01:05:59.109 --> 01:05:59.119 align:start position:0%
are obviously
 
01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
much in the news in the last couple of
 
01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:01.910 align:start position:0%
much in the news in the last couple of
years

01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:03.270 align:start position:0%
years
um

01:06:03.270 --> 01:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:05.589 --> 01:06:05.599 align:start position:0%
be careful about making representations
 
01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
about our former president's use of
 
01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
non-disclosure agreements but they are
 
01:06:14.390 --> 01:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
as the city of baltimore noted they're
 
01:06:16.150 --> 01:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
incredibly common
 
01:06:19.270 --> 01:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
in uh settling misconduct litigation
 
01:06:22.470 --> 01:06:22.480 align:start position:0%
problem is is if you want to do a study
 
01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
of police misconduct or correctional
 
01:06:29.589 --> 01:06:29.599 align:start position:0%
officer misconduct or school counsel or
 
01:06:31.910 --> 01:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
misconduct and if all the cases are
 
01:06:34.710 --> 01:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
sealed and nobody can talk about them
 
01:06:37.029 --> 01:06:37.039 align:start position:0%
then there's no way for the public
 
01:06:39.270 --> 01:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
to be able to do public policy to deal
 
01:06:40.710 --> 01:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
with those issues
 
01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
because the information is no longer
 
01:06:44.470 --> 01:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
available it's not available to the
 
01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:46.230 align:start position:0%
available it's not available to the
public

01:06:46.230 --> 01:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
so just a quick follow-up mr care yes
 
01:06:52.150 --> 01:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that the impact on access
 
01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
has been widely discredited and and your
 
01:06:56.069 --> 01:06:56.079 align:start position:0%
site the case
 
01:06:59.109 --> 01:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
are you is there empirical evidence
 
01:07:01.270 --> 01:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
in those jurisdictions where this has
 
01:07:03.109 --> 01:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
happened that has actually shown that
 
01:07:04.789 --> 01:07:04.799 align:start position:0%
now we haven't really seen a drop in
 
01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
access or are people coming after you're
 
01:07:09.510 --> 01:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
going to speak to that
 
01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:13.109 align:start position:0%
going to speak to that
um

01:07:13.109 --> 01:07:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:15.109 --> 01:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
there is
 
01:07:18.309 --> 01:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
a scholarly study by richard
 
01:07:21.190 --> 01:07:21.200 align:start position:0%
zitrin i can send you the site if you
 
01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:22.069 align:start position:0%
zitrin i can send you the site if you
wish

01:07:22.069 --> 01:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
wish
 
01:07:23.589 --> 01:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
it's called the case against secret
 
01:07:25.430 --> 01:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
settlements or what you don't know can
 
01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
hurt you
 
01:07:28.549 --> 01:07:28.559 align:start position:0%
in the institute for study of legal
 
01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
ethics in 1999
 
01:07:34.710 --> 01:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
and uh that's where it noted that states
 
01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
with anti-secrecy regulations have not
 
01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
seen a decrease in settlements
 
01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
and that parties who don't want their
 
01:07:43.109 --> 01:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
conduct exposed will still have a
 
01:07:45.589 --> 01:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
substantial incentive to settle before
 
01:07:48.549 --> 01:07:48.559 align:start position:0%
the heightened scrutiny of a trial
 
01:07:49.750 --> 01:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
you're welcome representative silver
 
01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
mr sharer thank you representative for
 
01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:55.039 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:07:57.510 --> 01:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
can you explain the rationale of why
 
01:08:01.270 --> 01:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money should be used to settle
 
01:08:03.109 --> 01:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
a dispute over
 
01:08:05.029 --> 01:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
governmental actions
 
01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
that should be kept secret from the
 
01:08:10.630 --> 01:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
public who's paying the bill
 
01:08:12.870 --> 01:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh no i cannot i think that's why
 
01:08:14.950 --> 01:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
there's three chairs at the table
 
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
um when you're talking about not only
 
01:08:20.470 --> 01:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
spending public money
 
01:08:22.709 --> 01:08:22.719 align:start position:0%
and trying to hide
 
01:08:24.709 --> 01:08:24.719 align:start position:0%
the reasons for it but you're also
 
01:08:26.950 --> 01:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
talking about the behavior of public
 
01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:28.470 align:start position:0%
talking about the behavior of public
employees

01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:08:30.309 --> 01:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
and uh who are
 
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh employees of of every one of us and
 
01:08:35.590 --> 01:08:35.600 align:start position:0%
we can't tell if they're doing a good
 
01:08:37.510 --> 01:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
job or not a good job
 
01:08:39.749 --> 01:08:39.759 align:start position:0%
if these settlements are quiet what has
 
01:08:41.510 --> 01:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
happened in some
 
01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
areas and this has happened in new
 
01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:44.630 align:start position:0%
areas and this has happened in new
hampshire

01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
is that for instance a police officer
 
01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:47.669 align:start position:0%
is that for instance a police officer
who

01:08:47.669 --> 01:08:47.679 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
does an act of misconduct
 
01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
and there's a settlement of the
 
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
misconduct case with secrecy the officer
 
01:08:57.829 --> 01:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
is allowed to quietly resign and the
 
01:08:59.590 --> 01:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
officer goes to the next town over and
 
01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
gets hired
 
01:09:04.470 --> 01:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
and uh repeats bad behavior
 
01:09:08.149 --> 01:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
and that is unfortunately that happens i
 
01:09:12.229 --> 01:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other questions
 
01:09:18.070 --> 01:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:19.349 --> 01:09:19.359 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
01:09:21.669 --> 01:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony today
 
01:09:21.679 --> 01:09:23.269 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony today
again

01:09:23.269 --> 01:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:09:32.229 --> 01:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh cordell
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
johnston representing the new hampshire
 
01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
municipal association in opposition to
 
01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
um as representative burch mentioned the
 
01:09:44.550 --> 01:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
house did pass an identical bill two
 
01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:48.319 align:start position:0%
the senate unanimously killed that on a
 
01:09:49.669 --> 01:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
voice vote
 
01:09:51.990 --> 01:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh when it when it got the bill and i
 
01:09:54.550 --> 01:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
think for for pretty good reason
 
01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:55.510 align:start position:0%
think for for pretty good reason
um

01:09:55.510 --> 01:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:57.590 --> 01:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
as representative burch mentioned in
 
01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
these in these situations uh there are i
 
01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
guess theoretically three seats at the
 
01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:03.669 align:start position:0%
guess theoretically three seats at the
table

01:10:03.669 --> 01:10:03.679 align:start position:0%
table
 
01:10:05.830 --> 01:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
uh one is the public but the other two
 
01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:06.790 align:start position:0%
uh one is the public but the other two
seats

01:10:06.790 --> 01:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
seats
 
01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
i don't think can be
 
01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:09.669 align:start position:0%
i don't think can be
ignored

01:10:09.669 --> 01:10:09.679 align:start position:0%
ignored
 
01:10:12.310 --> 01:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
um parties to a lawsuit should have a
 
01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
right to negotiate
 
01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
their settlement terms
 
01:10:19.189 --> 01:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
and we don't believe that the state
 
01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
should be interfering with uh that right
 
01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:24.149 align:start position:0%
should be interfering with uh that right
um

01:10:24.149 --> 01:10:24.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:26.470 --> 01:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
representative burch talked about
 
01:10:30.070 --> 01:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh police misconduct cases and i think
 
01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:31.350 align:start position:0%
uh police misconduct cases and i think
almost

01:10:31.350 --> 01:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
almost
 
01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
almost everything you mentioned was
 
01:10:35.430 --> 01:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
about police misconduct cases but this
 
01:10:37.669 --> 01:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
would apply to any um
 
01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
any lawsuit between a
 
01:10:41.830 --> 01:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
government entity any lawsuit involving
 
01:10:44.790 --> 01:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
a government entity and and
 
01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
police misconduct cases are going to be
 
01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
a very small fraction of all of those
 
01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
cases they're going to be all kinds of
 
01:10:55.110 --> 01:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
employment um employment
 
01:10:58.709 --> 01:10:58.719 align:start position:0%
litigation and other things um
 
01:11:01.270 --> 01:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
i think it is common sense that it will
 
01:11:04.870 --> 01:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
make it harder to to settle lawsuits
 
01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:06.390 align:start position:0%
make it harder to to settle lawsuits
um

01:11:06.390 --> 01:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:07.990 --> 01:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
parties negotiate
 
01:11:10.709 --> 01:11:10.719 align:start position:0%
settlement agreements um
 
01:11:13.030 --> 01:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
and there are various incentives to
 
01:11:14.950 --> 01:11:14.960 align:start position:0%
settle and this takes away
 
01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
a very important uh a very important
 
01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:19.669 align:start position:0%
a very important uh a very important
incentive

01:11:19.669 --> 01:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
incentive
 
01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things that
 
01:11:25.510 --> 01:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
needs to be kept in mind is that
 
01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:26.390 align:start position:0%
needs to be kept in mind is that
in

01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
many if not most of these cases
 
01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:30.390 align:start position:0%
many if not most of these cases
um

01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:32.470 --> 01:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
the settlement is going to be discussed
 
01:11:34.709 --> 01:11:34.719 align:start position:0%
and and much of the case is going to be
 
01:11:37.030 --> 01:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
discussed by a
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
board of selectmen or a
 
01:11:42.149 --> 01:11:42.159 align:start position:0%
school board or a city council in a
 
01:11:44.310 --> 01:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
non-public session
 
01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
for obvious reasons
 
01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:47.669 align:start position:0%
for obvious reasons
um

01:11:47.669 --> 01:11:47.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:49.189 --> 01:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
the minutes of those sessions will
 
01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
almost invariably be sealed to protect
 
01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:53.510 align:start position:0%
almost invariably be sealed to protect
um

01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:56.950 --> 01:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
to protect privacy and also to
 
01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:59.110 align:start position:0%
to protect privacy and also to
protect

01:11:59.110 --> 01:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
protect
 
01:12:02.149 --> 01:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
discussions involving litigation
 
01:12:02.159 --> 01:12:03.030 align:start position:0%
discussions involving litigation
those

01:12:03.030 --> 01:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
if those minutes are sealed and
 
01:12:06.950 --> 01:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
legally so
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
members of that public body are there
 
01:12:12.070 --> 01:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
after prohibited from talking about
 
01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
anything that went on in in non-public
 
01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:16.310 align:start position:0%
anything that went on in in non-public
section

01:12:16.310 --> 01:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
but the other party is not prohibited
 
01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
from talking about it
 
01:12:23.430 --> 01:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
so that leaves a situation where the
 
01:12:25.750 --> 01:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
employee former employee
 
01:12:26.709 --> 01:12:26.719 align:start position:0%
or the
 
01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
person whoever it is who brought the
 
01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
lawsuit is now perfectly free to
 
01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
say whatever he or she wants
 
01:12:36.790 --> 01:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
about what went on and whatever they
 
01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:37.669 align:start position:0%
about what went on and whatever they
want

01:12:37.669 --> 01:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
want
 
01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
about the
 
01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
public officials but the public
 
01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
officials are
 
01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
now the ones that are subject to a gag
 
01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.110 align:start position:0%
now the ones that are subject to a gag
order

01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
order
 
01:12:50.550 --> 01:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
and that is a problem
 
01:12:51.910 --> 01:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:12:53.430 --> 01:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
for those reasons
 
01:12:55.110 --> 01:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
we oppose the bill i know you have
 
01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
written testimony from other at least
 
01:12:59.510 --> 01:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
one other organization opposing it for
 
01:13:01.189 --> 01:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
similar reasons and i'll end my
 
01:13:03.430 --> 01:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
testimony there thank you
 
01:13:06.149 --> 01:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr johnson and representative
 
01:13:10.950 --> 01:13:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much um
 
01:13:17.910 --> 01:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
mr chair um mr johnson can you explain
 
01:13:22.229 --> 01:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:22.239 --> 01:13:23.189 align:start position:0%
 
why

01:13:23.189 --> 01:13:23.199 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:13:25.510 --> 01:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
the public
 
01:13:28.630 --> 01:13:28.640 align:start position:0%
in a state that
 
01:13:32.390 --> 01:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
values the concept of right to know
 
01:13:33.990 --> 01:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
should not
 
01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:34.790 align:start position:0%
should not
know

01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:36.229 align:start position:0%
know
about

01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
what happened in these negotiations
 
01:13:44.830 --> 01:13:44.840 align:start position:0%
i know that the municipal association
 
01:13:48.870 --> 01:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
um tends to see itself as
 
01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
playing the role of protecting
 
01:13:52.709 --> 01:13:52.719 align:start position:0%
the town
 
01:13:57.110 --> 01:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:59.189 align:start position:0%
 
but

01:13:59.189 --> 01:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:14:02.630 --> 01:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
since they those governments are there
 
01:14:04.630 --> 01:14:04.640 align:start position:0%
at the behest of the citizens who
 
01:14:06.229 --> 01:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
elected them
 
01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
why shouldn't the citizens have access
 
01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:11.430 align:start position:0%
why shouldn't the citizens have access
to

01:14:11.430 --> 01:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:18.390 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:14:18.390 --> 01:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:21.030 align:start position:0%
the
um

01:14:21.030 --> 01:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:23.830 --> 01:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
first of all it's not real it's not
 
01:14:27.669 --> 01:14:27.679 align:start position:0%
the details of the negotiations
 
01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
that would be that are prohibited by a
 
01:14:32.070 --> 01:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
non-disparagement agreement
 
01:14:34.390 --> 01:14:34.400 align:start position:0%
what is prohibited is
 
01:14:35.830 --> 01:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
either party
 
01:14:37.590 --> 01:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
from uh
 
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
making negative comments
 
01:14:43.590 --> 01:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
about the other party so it's not the
 
01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
it's not the um
 
01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
it's not the negotiations the the
 
01:14:50.070 --> 01:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
negotiations are
 
01:14:51.669 --> 01:14:51.679 align:start position:0%
done in private but that's a that's a
 
01:14:53.910 --> 01:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
separate issue that's not this bill
 
01:14:56.390 --> 01:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
that's that's the the right to know law
 
01:14:58.550 --> 01:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
i suppose if you want to
 
01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
if you want to address that through the
 
01:15:02.310 --> 01:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
right to know law although we would have
 
01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
you would have concerns about that too
 
01:15:07.990 --> 01:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
um what the non-disparaging agreement is
 
01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.030 align:start position:0%
um what the non-disparaging agreement is
simply

01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
simply
 
01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
it limits what one party can say about
 
01:15:13.669 --> 01:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
the other party
 
01:15:13.679 --> 01:15:15.510 align:start position:0%
the other party
and

01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:15:17.990 --> 01:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
as i said i acknowledge that there is a
 
01:15:19.669 --> 01:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
third seat at the table the public has
 
01:15:20.709 --> 01:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
an interest
 
01:15:22.229 --> 01:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:15:26.630 --> 01:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
employees uh have a privacy interest
 
01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:27.590 align:start position:0%
employees uh have a privacy interest
um

01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
police where who are accused of
 
01:15:33.110 --> 01:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
misconduct have a privacy interest
 
01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:34.630 align:start position:0%
misconduct have a privacy interest
um

01:15:34.630 --> 01:15:34.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:37.189 --> 01:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
and so there there are a number of
 
01:15:38.790 --> 01:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
interests at stake
 
01:15:41.189 --> 01:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't think it's
 
01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
as easy as saying just the public has a
 
01:15:45.430 --> 01:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
right to know and
 
01:15:50.630 --> 01:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:52.870 --> 01:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
thank you i won't belabor this now thank
 
01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:53.590 align:start position:0%
thank you i won't belabor this now thank
you

01:15:53.590 --> 01:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:56.390 align:start position:0%
you
representative

01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:59.110 --> 01:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you mr
 
01:16:00.870 --> 01:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
johnson for taking our attorney johnson
 
01:16:02.630 --> 01:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
mike question
 
01:16:05.510 --> 01:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to verify what you said
 
01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:06.470 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to verify what you said
about

01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:16:08.310 --> 01:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
if we've got the three people at the
 
01:16:10.550 --> 01:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
table or the three chairs
 
01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
and there's a non-public hearing and
 
01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
those minutes are sealed
 
01:16:17.110 --> 01:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
did you say that the person say the
 
01:16:20.550 --> 01:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
public person is able to talk about it
 
01:16:22.950 --> 01:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
but the other the people that are under
 
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
the non-disclosure have to keep their
 
01:16:27.990 --> 01:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
mouths quiet
 
01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
what i'm saying is um
 
01:16:32.470 --> 01:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
setting aside a non-disparagement
 
01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:33.669 align:start position:0%
setting aside a non-disparagement
agreement

01:16:33.669 --> 01:16:33.679 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
if i'm
 
01:16:37.590 --> 01:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
if i'm the person who has sued the town
 
01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:40.400 align:start position:0%
or have been sued by the town
 
01:16:42.870 --> 01:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
and there is a
 
01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:43.910 align:start position:0%
and there is a
uh

01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:16:46.709 --> 01:16:46.719 align:start position:0%
there's a discussion in non-public
 
01:16:46.719 --> 01:16:48.870 align:start position:0%
there's a discussion in non-public
session

01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh among say the board of selectmen
 
01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
um and then the minutes of that
 
01:16:55.910 --> 01:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
non-public session are sealed
 
01:16:57.669 --> 01:16:57.679 align:start position:0%
they are the
 
01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
the members of the public body the board
 
01:17:02.550 --> 01:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
of selectmen in this case are prohibited
 
01:17:04.630 --> 01:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
from revealing
 
01:17:06.630 --> 01:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
what occurred in that non-public section
 
01:17:08.149 --> 01:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
and if they do they're subject to
 
01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
removal from office under rsa i think
 
01:17:14.070 --> 01:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
it's 42 colon 1a
 
01:17:16.470 --> 01:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
but i if if i the
 
01:17:20.149 --> 01:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
employee or the the person who is uh
 
01:17:21.750 --> 01:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
on the other side of the lawsuit if i
 
01:17:24.149 --> 01:17:24.159 align:start position:0%
reveal what happened in in non-public
 
01:17:24.159 --> 01:17:25.510 align:start position:0%
reveal what happened in in non-public
session

01:17:25.510 --> 01:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:17:27.910 --> 01:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
there's no i've done nothing wrong i
 
01:17:29.669 --> 01:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
have a perfect i have a perfect right to
 
01:17:30.630 --> 01:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
do that
 
01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:31.830 align:start position:0%
do that
unless

01:17:31.830 --> 01:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
unless
 
01:17:34.149 --> 01:17:34.159 align:start position:0%
there is a non-disparagement agreement
 
01:17:36.390 --> 01:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
that prohibits me from doing that
 
01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:37.750 align:start position:0%
that prohibits me from doing that
okay

01:17:37.750 --> 01:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:17:40.390 --> 01:17:40.400 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair can you hear me
 
01:18:18.870 --> 01:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
we can
 
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
thank you my name is robert mcnamara i'm
 
01:18:22.790 --> 01:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
a senior attorney with a non-profit law
 
01:18:24.550 --> 01:18:24.560 align:start position:0%
firm called the institute for justice
 
01:18:26.229 --> 01:18:26.239 align:start position:0%
here in arlington virginia where we've
 
01:18:27.750 --> 01:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
done a lot of work on the first
 
01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
amendment implications of these sorts of
 
01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
gag orders and we're actually currently
 
01:18:33.669 --> 01:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
engaged in litigation against the
 
01:18:35.350 --> 01:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
securities and exchange commission about
 
01:18:37.270 --> 01:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
whether these sorts of gag orders
 
01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
violate the constitution i'm here to
 
01:18:41.430 --> 01:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
speak in favor of the bill which i think
 
01:18:44.229 --> 01:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
is wise both as a matter of policy and
 
01:18:46.870 --> 01:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
as a matter of law i think the the best
 
01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
way to understand the policy argument
 
01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:49.669 align:start position:0%
way to understand the policy argument
here

01:18:49.669 --> 01:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:18:52.390 --> 01:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
is to imagine a lawsuit where the
 
01:18:54.709 --> 01:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
government settles for fifty thousand
 
01:18:57.830 --> 01:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
dollars plus a non-disparagement clause
 
01:18:59.430 --> 01:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
and i think there are only two things
 
01:19:01.590 --> 01:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
that could be going on in that lawsuit
 
01:19:03.510 --> 01:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
either the fair settlement value of the
 
01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
lawsuit was actually less than fifty
 
01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and the government
 
01:19:10.229 --> 01:19:10.239 align:start position:0%
defendant is paying out extra taxpayer
 
01:19:12.390 --> 01:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
dollars in order to
 
01:19:14.790 --> 01:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
pay the private citizen not to speak out
 
01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
on a matter of public concern whether
 
01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:17.590 align:start position:0%
on a matter of public concern whether
it's

01:19:17.590 --> 01:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:19:19.510 --> 01:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
don't go telling people that our police
 
01:19:21.510 --> 01:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
department engaged in misconduct or
 
01:19:23.350 --> 01:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
don't go telling people that we do a bad
 
01:19:25.590 --> 01:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
job clearing the ice in the parking lot
 
01:19:28.149 --> 01:19:28.159 align:start position:0%
they're paying taxpayer dollars to buy a
 
01:19:30.310 --> 01:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
private citizen's silence but i think
 
01:19:32.149 --> 01:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
the alternative is actually worse the
 
01:19:34.149 --> 01:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
alternative in that case is the fair
 
01:19:36.229 --> 01:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
settlement value of that case actually
 
01:19:38.229 --> 01:19:38.239 align:start position:0%
was 50 000
 
01:19:40.229 --> 01:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
and the government is withholding the
 
01:19:42.470 --> 01:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
fair payment in an effort to coerce the
 
01:19:44.229 --> 01:19:44.239 align:start position:0%
private citizen
 
01:19:46.229 --> 01:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
into agreeing to give up their basic
 
01:19:48.390 --> 01:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
first amendment right to criticize the
 
01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:49.430 align:start position:0%
first amendment right to criticize the
government

01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:19:52.149 --> 01:19:52.159 align:start position:0%
um either way i think that's deeply
 
01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
troublesome and it's even more
 
01:19:55.189 --> 01:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
troublesome in a context where the
 
01:19:57.750 --> 01:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
government brings the suit itself brings
 
01:20:00.470 --> 01:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
the full coercive apparatus of the state
 
01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
and says we'll go away but we'll go away
 
01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
if and only if you promise not to say
 
01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
bad things about us uh it is i think
 
01:20:10.709 --> 01:20:10.719 align:start position:0%
inherently dangerous when the government
 
01:20:13.030 --> 01:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh uses its power to coerce private
 
01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
citizens not to say bad things about
 
01:20:18.550 --> 01:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
that very government uh but i also think
 
01:20:20.310 --> 01:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
going to the
 
01:20:22.310 --> 01:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
the question of whether this bill would
 
01:20:24.070 --> 01:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
increase litigation costs i think it's
 
01:20:26.709 --> 01:20:26.719 align:start position:0%
actually quite the opposite uh because
 
01:20:28.870 --> 01:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
one other thing that emerged in the the
 
01:20:30.950 --> 01:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
2019 fourth circuit case that
 
01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
representative burch mentioned is the
 
01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
fourth circuit didn't just find that
 
01:20:37.030 --> 01:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
agreements like this can violate the
 
01:20:39.030 --> 01:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
first amendment and actually found that
 
01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
the news media can bring lawsuits on its
 
01:20:43.350 --> 01:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
own bring its own first amendment
 
01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
challenges to policies of including
 
01:20:47.750 --> 01:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
provisions like this in settlement
 
01:20:50.149 --> 01:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
agreements so one of the plaintiffs in
 
01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
that case was just a local newspaper
 
01:20:54.550 --> 01:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
suing the city of baltimore and so too
 
01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
the concord monitor reporter that
 
01:20:58.229 --> 01:20:58.239 align:start position:0%
representative burch mentioned would be
 
01:21:00.070 --> 01:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
able to bring his own lawsuit and say it
 
01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
violates the first amendment when you
 
01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
insert these agreements in settlement
 
01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:04.390 align:start position:0%
insert these agreements in settlement
agreements

01:21:04.390 --> 01:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
agreements
 
01:21:07.270 --> 01:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
and so it's not just the question of
 
01:21:09.270 --> 01:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
whether settlement agreements increase
 
01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
or decrease the difficulty of settling
 
01:21:13.669 --> 01:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
the case in which the gag order is being
 
01:21:13.679 --> 01:21:14.470 align:start position:0%
the case in which the gag order is being
entered

01:21:14.470 --> 01:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
entered
 
01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
allowing government entities to demand
 
01:21:19.270 --> 01:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
gag orders like these in new hampshire
 
01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
will actually lead to brand new
 
01:21:22.950 --> 01:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
litigation whole new lawsuits first
 
01:21:24.630 --> 01:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
amendment challenges that could be
 
01:21:27.110 --> 01:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
avoided if the policy embodied by this
 
01:21:28.390 --> 01:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
bill were in place
 
01:21:29.910 --> 01:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
with that i thank you very much for your
 
01:21:31.669 --> 01:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
time and the opportunity to testify and
 
01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
representative macbeth
 
01:21:49.430 --> 01:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and and thank you for
 
01:21:51.669 --> 01:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
uh taking my question um attorney
 
01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
mcnamara i'm just wondering um is the
 
01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:56.950 align:start position:0%
mcnamara i'm just wondering um is the
non-disparagement

01:21:56.950 --> 01:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
non-disparagement
 
01:21:59.830 --> 01:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
is that defined in within the statute or
 
01:22:02.950 --> 01:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
is there um significant um case law that
 
01:22:05.430 --> 01:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
lets people exactly know what that what
 
01:22:07.430 --> 01:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
is included in that um
 
01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:08.310 align:start position:0%
is included in that um
phrase

01:22:08.310 --> 01:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
phrase
 
01:22:11.669 --> 01:22:11.679 align:start position:0%
thank you i i think the the fair
 
01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
definition of a non-disparagement
 
01:22:16.790 --> 01:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
agreement uh is an an agreement that
 
01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:17.910 align:start position:0%
agreement uh is an an agreement that
prevents

01:22:17.910 --> 01:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
prevents
 
01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:19.830 align:start position:0%
prevents
um

01:22:19.830 --> 01:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
that quite simply prevents a party from
 
01:22:23.990 --> 01:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
saying a bad thing about another party
 
01:22:26.070 --> 01:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
from disputing the facts of the
 
01:22:29.350 --> 01:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
underlying case uh and i think that is
 
01:22:32.629 --> 01:22:32.639 align:start position:0%
the the heart of the bill it's not about
 
01:22:34.790 --> 01:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh the ability to disclose the ins and
 
01:22:37.030 --> 01:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
outs of particular negotiations and who
 
01:22:39.270 --> 01:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
offered what what these clauses are used
 
01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:40.070 align:start position:0%
offered what what these clauses are used
for

01:22:40.070 --> 01:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:22:42.790 --> 01:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
uh is preventing the
 
01:22:44.390 --> 01:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
either party from going out in public
 
01:22:46.310 --> 01:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
and saying what the government did to me
 
01:22:48.550 --> 01:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
was really bad uh or the government
 
01:22:50.709 --> 01:22:50.719 align:start position:0%
going out and saying that person's lying
 
01:22:52.229 --> 01:22:52.239 align:start position:0%
we didn't really do something that was
 
01:22:53.350 --> 01:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
very bad to them that's how
 
01:22:55.830 --> 01:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
non-disparagement clauses are used in
 
01:22:57.990 --> 01:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
private litigation but in public
 
01:23:00.950 --> 01:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
litigation the the basic right to say
 
01:23:02.550 --> 01:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
what the government did to me was really
 
01:23:04.229 --> 01:23:04.239 align:start position:0%
bad and the right of the government to
 
01:23:05.910 --> 01:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
put out its own press releases and say
 
01:23:08.709 --> 01:23:08.719 align:start position:0%
what we did wasn't really bad is is the
 
01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
heart of how we engage in
 
01:23:12.149 --> 01:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
self-government in this country and
 
01:23:13.830 --> 01:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
agreements not to disparage the
 
01:23:16.470 --> 01:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
government uh are agreements not to
 
01:23:18.470 --> 01:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
engage in fundamental political
 
01:23:19.590 --> 01:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
discourse and that's why they're
 
01:23:21.189 --> 01:23:21.199 align:start position:0%
appropriate with purely private
 
01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
litigation but are deeply dangerous when
 
01:23:29.030 --> 01:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:31.189 --> 01:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:23:35.189 --> 01:23:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:37.910 --> 01:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
i think mr mcnamara if i could it seems
 
01:23:39.750 --> 01:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
to me that
 
01:23:42.870 --> 01:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
having practiced and
 
01:23:46.390 --> 01:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
drafted settlement agreements
 
01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:47.189 align:start position:0%
drafted settlement agreements
i

01:23:47.189 --> 01:23:47.199 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:23:49.030 --> 01:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
and including despair and
 
01:23:51.590 --> 01:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
non-disparagement clauses
 
01:23:55.270 --> 01:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
the idea as an attorney is that
 
01:23:57.270 --> 01:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
you don't want to continue litigating an
 
01:23:57.280 --> 01:23:59.030 align:start position:0%
you don't want to continue litigating an
event

01:23:59.030 --> 01:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
event
 
01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:00.229 align:start position:0%
event
after

01:24:00.229 --> 01:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
after
 
01:24:03.189 --> 01:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
after you've settled and just settling
 
01:24:05.910 --> 01:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
it for money doesn't necessarily settle
 
01:24:07.430 --> 01:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
the dispute
 
01:24:10.790 --> 01:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
if the one of the parties can still
 
01:24:13.750 --> 01:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
actively contest the facts
 
01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:15.189 align:start position:0%
actively contest the facts
so

01:24:15.189 --> 01:24:15.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:24:18.070 --> 01:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
there's certainly an advantage to having
 
01:24:20.870 --> 01:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
the non-disparagement provision
 
01:24:23.110 --> 01:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
in the in your settlement agreement
 
01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:24.070 align:start position:0%
in the in your settlement agreement
because

01:24:24.070 --> 01:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:24:27.669 --> 01:24:27.679 align:start position:0%
in fact that's what settles the case
 
01:24:31.830 --> 01:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
but the other side of it is that
 
01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
that because and i think it's the
 
01:24:37.270 --> 01:24:37.280 align:start position:0%
three-chair issue that is because a
 
01:24:39.189 --> 01:24:39.199 align:start position:0%
government entity is working on behalf
 
01:24:40.950 --> 01:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
of the people that the people have a
 
01:24:42.790 --> 01:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
right to know so it seems to me that our
 
01:24:45.110 --> 01:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
decision today is a decision as to
 
01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
whether we think the people's right to
 
01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:48.790 align:start position:0%
whether we think the people's right to
know

01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:49.990 align:start position:0%
know
has

01:24:49.990 --> 01:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
imbalance a greater value
 
01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:53.430 align:start position:0%
imbalance a greater value
than

01:24:53.430 --> 01:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:24:56.149 --> 01:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
fully settling a case
 
01:24:58.229 --> 01:24:58.239 align:start position:0%
so i think you're absolutely right mr
 
01:25:00.310 --> 01:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
chair that that's the value of clauses
 
01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
like this for private citizens where you
 
01:25:04.550 --> 01:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
can say i just never want to talk about
 
01:25:06.470 --> 01:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
this car accident again i don't think it
 
01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
was my fault but i want to give you five
 
01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in exchange for just
 
01:25:12.550 --> 01:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
never ever talking about this again but
 
01:25:14.550 --> 01:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
i think framing the impulse that way
 
01:25:16.790 --> 01:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
illustrates why it's an unacceptable
 
01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
impulse for government the government
 
01:25:19.910 --> 01:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't get to say
 
01:25:22.229 --> 01:25:22.239 align:start position:0%
i just never ever want to talk about
 
01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
this police misconduct case again i just
 
01:25:26.790 --> 01:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
never ever want to talk about whether
 
01:25:28.149 --> 01:25:28.159 align:start position:0%
we're doing a good job at road
 
01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
maintenance again
 
01:25:31.350 --> 01:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
because the public debate about what
 
01:25:33.350 --> 01:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
happened in the past is in part the
 
01:25:34.950 --> 01:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
public debate about how we're going to
 
01:25:36.950 --> 01:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
prevent things like this from happening
 
01:25:39.430 --> 01:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
in the future and it's just not i think
 
01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
a permissible impulse for the government
 
01:25:43.830 --> 01:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
in a free society to say we should just
 
01:25:45.910 --> 01:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
never discuss this incident again uh the
 
01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
people who decide whether or not they
 
01:25:49.590 --> 01:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
care about that incident are the voters
 
01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
and they're not the government as
 
01:25:52.950 --> 01:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
litigants saying we're done with this
 
01:25:55.590 --> 01:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
and moving on
 
01:25:57.750 --> 01:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:26:00.950 --> 01:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
are there other questions
 
01:26:03.990 --> 01:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
for mr mcnamara
 
01:26:05.430 --> 01:26:05.440 align:start position:0%

have been awarded
 
01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:57.840 align:start position:0%

they told me not to bring the case to

them it was the worst case they had ever
 
01:29:12.550 --> 01:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
seen and to simply go settle it don't
 
01:29:19.510 --> 01:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:22.629 --> 01:29:22.639 align:start position:0%

there is no gag order in my settlement
 
01:29:39.590 --> 01:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
agreement it was the only thing that i
 
01:29:42.470 --> 01:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
wanted out of my settlement agreement
 
01:29:44.950 --> 01:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
so that i could speak about it
 
01:29:47.350 --> 01:29:47.360 align:start position:0%

01:30:07.350 --> 01:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:10.229 --> 01:30:10.239 align:start position:0%
i needed someone to act
 
01:30:12.390 --> 01:30:12.400 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
01:30:15.030 --> 01:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
there are 36 dead veterans at the home
 
01:30:18.070 --> 01:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
as a result of this coveted virus
 
01:30:20.470 --> 01:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
it didn't have to happen
 
01:30:22.310 --> 01:30:22.320 align:start position:0%

looking what year were those hp 1403 and
 
01:30:50.790 --> 01:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
i believe that hb
 
01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:54.629 align:start position:0%
i believe that hb
1403

01:30:54.629 --> 01:30:54.639 align:start position:0%
1403
 
01:30:54.639 --> 01:30:55.510 align:start position:0%
1403
was

01:30:55.510 --> 01:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:30:57.990 --> 01:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
january of 2010.
 
01:30:59.270 --> 01:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:31:02.950 --> 01:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
and uh hb 591
 
01:31:04.870 --> 01:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
that went for a while
 
01:31:08.070 --> 01:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
i think it was finally um
 
01:31:11.189 --> 01:31:11.199 align:start position:0%
it did not succeed because it was not
 
01:31:13.830 --> 01:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
able to be overturned by the veto of the
 
01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:14.870 align:start position:0%
able to be overturned by the veto of the
governor

01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
governor
 
01:31:17.189 --> 01:31:17.199 align:start position:0%
i think that was the result of that was
 
01:31:18.790 --> 01:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
in 2014
 
01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:20.310 align:start position:0%
in 2014
okay

01:31:20.310 --> 01:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
um it was specifically to provide status
 
01:31:27.030 --> 01:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:27.910 align:start position:0%
 
now

01:31:27.910 --> 01:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:30.400 align:start position:0%
those were the only avenues that i could
 
01:31:32.149 --> 01:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
find although i have
 
01:31:32.159 --> 01:31:33.270 align:start position:0%
find although i have
gotten

01:31:33.270 --> 01:31:33.280 align:start position:0%
gotten
 
01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:34.550 align:start position:0%
gotten
some

01:31:34.550 --> 01:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:31:36.950 --> 01:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
minimal press coverage certainly not in
 
01:31:39.189 --> 01:31:39.199 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire
 
01:31:41.910 --> 01:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
none of the press would touch my case
 
01:31:44.070 --> 01:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
nobody would come near it nobody would
 
01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:45.669 align:start position:0%
nobody would come near it nobody would
talk

01:31:45.669 --> 01:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
talk
 
01:31:47.669 --> 01:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
uh i did get some national press on the
 
01:31:49.669 --> 01:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
issue you can find that as well
 
01:31:51.830 --> 01:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
oh thanks yeah
 
01:31:53.030 --> 01:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:31:56.149 --> 01:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
we all agree that the 36 deaths um the
 
01:31:58.070 --> 01:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
veterans were a tragedy although we'll
 
01:31:59.830 --> 01:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
say we have one member no they're not a
 
01:32:01.350 --> 01:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
tragedy that was a preventable
 
01:32:03.750 --> 01:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
circumstance as was the global situation
 
01:32:05.350 --> 01:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
at hand right now
 
01:32:07.590 --> 01:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
i have never taken an oath to defend or
 
01:32:09.750 --> 01:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
uphold the constitution
 
01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
i know where the duty of we the people
 
01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:13.910 align:start position:0%
i know where the duty of we the people
rests

01:32:13.910 --> 01:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
rests
 
01:32:16.390 --> 01:32:16.400 align:start position:0%
and it rests in the first amendment
 
01:32:18.390 --> 01:32:18.400 align:start position:0%
and the second amendment is there to
 
01:32:19.990 --> 01:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
defend the first
 
01:32:22.070 --> 01:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
i understand we have a one member who's
 
01:32:23.590 --> 01:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
not a member of his committees he's not
 
01:32:24.709 --> 01:32:24.719 align:start position:0%
here but
 
01:32:27.030 --> 01:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
a tireless defender of both veterans and
 
01:32:28.950 --> 01:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
the second amendment and he
 
01:32:31.189 --> 01:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
or whatever is worth um must be aware of
 
01:32:33.270 --> 01:32:33.280 align:start position:0%
the veterans home and i rely on him to
 
01:32:35.430 --> 01:32:35.440 align:start position:0%

and
we

01:33:34.149 --> 01:33:34.159 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:33:36.790 --> 01:33:36.800 align:start position:0%
only have one other bill to hear this
 
01:33:38.950 --> 01:33:38.960 align:start position:0%

01:33:40.550 --> 01:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
10-minute break

10-minute break
um

01:34:02.149 --> 01:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
going to testify on our next bill which
 
01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:05.040 align:start position:0%

five-minute break that would be great

action against the state to protect
 
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:17.760 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair
 
01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:27.430 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
um

01:42:27.430 --> 01:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:28.390 --> 01:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:42:28.400 --> 01:42:29.350 align:start position:0%
this bill
uh

01:42:29.350 --> 01:42:29.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:42:31.510 --> 01:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
involves uh ending what's called
 
01:42:33.350 --> 01:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity
 
01:42:35.830 --> 01:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
what is qualified immunity
 
01:42:38.790 --> 01:42:38.800 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity shields government
 
01:42:40.830 --> 01:42:40.840 align:start position:0%
officials from damages
 
01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
liability even if they have violated
 
01:42:46.550 --> 01:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs constitutional rights
 
01:42:49.030 --> 01:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
so long as they have not violated
 
01:42:51.830 --> 01:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
clearly established law
 
01:42:53.830 --> 01:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
and the courts have said that except in
 
01:42:56.310 --> 01:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
extraordinary circumstances
 
01:42:58.950 --> 01:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
the law is quote clearly established
 
01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:00.229 align:start position:0%
the law is quote clearly established
unquote

01:43:00.229 --> 01:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
unquote
 
01:43:02.550 --> 01:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
only if a prior case has declared the
 
01:43:04.790 --> 01:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
conduct unconstitutional
 
01:43:07.830 --> 01:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
and that prior case must have facts that
 
01:43:09.830 --> 01:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
map neatly onto the facts of the
 
01:43:11.430 --> 01:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's case
 
01:43:13.750 --> 01:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
it's not enough just to point to
 
01:43:15.830 --> 01:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
general supreme court cases or other
 
01:43:18.550 --> 01:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
cases that set out frameworks
 
01:43:20.550 --> 01:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
processing the constitutionality of the
 
01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
use of force
 
01:43:25.430 --> 01:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
you have to show specific holdings of
 
01:43:27.350 --> 01:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
specific cases
 
01:43:30.470 --> 01:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
to find a factually similar case is a
 
01:43:32.149 --> 01:43:32.159 align:start position:0%
challenge on its own
 
01:43:34.310 --> 01:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
given the unending number of ways
 
01:43:35.910 --> 01:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
government officials
 
01:43:37.830 --> 01:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
can violate people's constitutional
 
01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:39.030 align:start position:0%
can violate people's constitutional
rights

01:43:39.030 --> 01:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
rights
 
01:43:41.109 --> 01:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity
 
01:43:43.750 --> 01:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
is was invented by the courts
 
01:43:46.229 --> 01:43:46.239 align:start position:0%
your so-called judicial activism
 
01:43:49.270 --> 01:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
was invented by the supreme court back
 
01:43:53.270 --> 01:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
in 1967 not by the legislatures
 
01:43:55.590 --> 01:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
and it's been an abject failure
 
01:43:57.270 --> 01:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
it protects officers who have
 
01:43:57.280 --> 01:43:58.790 align:start position:0%
it protects officers who have
outrageously

01:43:58.790 --> 01:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
outrageously
 
01:44:01.270 --> 01:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
abused their power simply because no
 
01:44:04.790 --> 01:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
prior decision has declared that exact
 
01:44:08.229 --> 01:44:08.239 align:start position:0%
specific conduct unconstitutional
 
01:44:10.550 --> 01:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
this immunity goes against deeply held
 
01:44:12.310 --> 01:44:12.320 align:start position:0%
new hampshire values
 
01:44:14.950 --> 01:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
the citizens are entitled to redress of
 
01:44:16.310 --> 01:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
their wrongs
 
01:44:18.470 --> 01:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
through the legal process
 
01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:19.189 align:start position:0%
through the legal process
that

01:44:19.189 --> 01:44:19.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:44:20.790 --> 01:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
is enshrined in the new hampshire
 
01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:22.390 align:start position:0%
is enshrined in the new hampshire
constitution

01:44:22.390 --> 01:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
in fact this judiciary committee has
 
01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:27.430 align:start position:0%
in fact this judiciary committee has
historically

01:44:27.430 --> 01:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
historically
 
01:44:30.310 --> 01:44:30.320 align:start position:0%
stood for the principle that the doors
 
01:44:31.910 --> 01:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
of our courts
 
01:44:34.550 --> 01:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
are to be open to our citizens
 
01:44:36.550 --> 01:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
for redress of wrongs committed by
 
01:44:38.950 --> 01:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
government agents
 
01:44:40.950 --> 01:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
i further want to note that this
 
01:44:43.270 --> 01:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
doctrine of qualified immunity has been
 
01:44:45.830 --> 01:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
criticized because it rewards poor
 
01:44:49.189 --> 01:44:49.199 align:start position:0%
training of police officers
 
01:44:51.109 --> 01:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
the doctrine seeks to shield police
 
01:44:53.109 --> 01:44:53.119 align:start position:0%
officers from damages
 
01:44:55.830 --> 01:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
liability unless they had
 
01:44:57.189 --> 01:44:57.199 align:start position:0%
fair warning
 
01:44:59.270 --> 01:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
or fair notice
 
01:45:02.470 --> 01:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
of the unlawfulness of their acts but if
 
01:45:04.709 --> 01:45:04.719 align:start position:0%
they've been poorly trained
 
01:45:07.669 --> 01:45:07.679 align:start position:0%
or not trained in what the law is
 
01:45:09.510 --> 01:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
then it becomes easy to say that they
 
01:45:13.109 --> 01:45:13.119 align:start position:0%
had no fair warning or fair notice
 
01:45:15.189 --> 01:45:15.199 align:start position:0%
so bad training or no training becomes
 
01:45:18.470 --> 01:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
rewarded and that's not a good thing
 
01:45:22.070 --> 01:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
it's often asserted perhaps wrongly
 
01:45:23.910 --> 01:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
that this immunity is required because
 
01:45:26.070 --> 01:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
police have to make split split level
 
01:45:28.470 --> 01:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
decisions split second decisions
 
01:45:30.550 --> 01:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
and should not be impoverished
 
01:45:32.950 --> 01:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
because they make a wrong decision
 
01:45:36.229 --> 01:45:36.239 align:start position:0%
let's examine briefly both premises
 
01:45:39.030 --> 01:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
doctors make split-second decisions
 
01:45:41.510 --> 01:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
they don't have qualified immunity
 
01:45:43.270 --> 01:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
lawyers make
 
01:45:44.709 --> 01:45:44.719 align:start position:0%
second decisions
 
01:45:48.470 --> 01:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
they have no such immunity i could go on
 
01:45:50.790 --> 01:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
no one should have immunity if they act
 
01:45:52.790 --> 01:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
under color of law
 
01:45:55.270 --> 01:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
and violate the constitutional rights of
 
01:45:55.280 --> 01:45:56.550 align:start position:0%
and violate the constitutional rights of
citizens

01:45:56.550 --> 01:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
01:45:59.189 --> 01:45:59.199 align:start position:0%
they must be held accountable
 
01:46:01.109 --> 01:46:01.119 align:start position:0%
as to the second issue
 
01:46:03.030 --> 01:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
and that's what's really different about
 
01:46:05.669 --> 01:46:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:07.750 --> 01:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
this bill removes
 
01:46:10.390 --> 01:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
the financial penalty against individual
 
01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
government officials
 
01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:14.790 align:start position:0%
government officials
period

01:46:14.790 --> 01:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
period
 
01:46:17.910 --> 01:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
the individual himself or herself
 
01:46:21.030 --> 01:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
will not be held financially liable
 
01:46:23.350 --> 01:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
under this statute
 
01:46:26.629 --> 01:46:26.639 align:start position:0%
when an individual is sued the state or
 
01:46:28.790 --> 01:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
its political subdivisions
 
01:46:31.030 --> 01:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
are responsible for the actions of its
 
01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:32.709 align:start position:0%
are responsible for the actions of its
employees

01:46:32.709 --> 01:46:32.719 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:46:35.430 --> 01:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
and will pay for any damages resulting
 
01:46:37.910 --> 01:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
in the proven wrongful acts of its
 
01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:39.350 align:start position:0%
in the proven wrongful acts of its
employees

01:46:39.350 --> 01:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:46:41.350 --> 01:46:41.360 align:start position:0%
but the bottom line is
 
01:46:44.310 --> 01:46:44.320 align:start position:0%
that the employee is held financially
 
01:46:44.320 --> 01:46:45.669 align:start position:0%
that the employee is held financially
harmless

01:46:45.669 --> 01:46:45.679 align:start position:0%
harmless
 
01:46:47.750 --> 01:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
of course the employer can still take
 
01:46:50.310 --> 01:46:50.320 align:start position:0%
whatever lawful and appropriate measures
 
01:46:52.709 --> 01:46:52.719 align:start position:0%
it wishes against the employee
 
01:46:55.189 --> 01:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
as per the employment contract
 
01:46:57.590 --> 01:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
union rules state or municipal law or
 
01:46:57.600 --> 01:46:58.870 align:start position:0%
union rules state or municipal law or
whatever

01:46:58.870 --> 01:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:47:01.430 --> 01:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
so basically in conclusion this bill
 
01:47:03.270 --> 01:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
splits the difference
 
01:47:05.669 --> 01:47:05.679 align:start position:0%
it allows our citizens to seek redress
 
01:47:06.950 --> 01:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
in the courts
 
01:47:09.830 --> 01:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
for violation of constitutional rights
 
01:47:11.830 --> 01:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
and it protects individual offenders
 
01:47:13.830 --> 01:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
from financial penalty
 
01:47:15.910 --> 01:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
apportioning those costs to the entity
 
01:47:18.790 --> 01:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
that hired the individual
 
01:47:22.229 --> 01:47:22.239 align:start position:0%
it puts a premium on effective training
 
01:47:24.149 --> 01:47:24.159 align:start position:0%
of government employees so that they
 
01:47:25.830 --> 01:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
don't violate
 
01:47:28.390 --> 01:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights of citizens
 
01:47:30.070 --> 01:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
and encourages the state of new
 
01:47:32.629 --> 01:47:32.639 align:start position:0%
hampshire and political subdivisions
 
01:47:35.750 --> 01:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
to be vigilant in not employing people
 
01:47:38.390 --> 01:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
who have or might have a tendency to
 
01:47:40.709 --> 01:47:40.719 align:start position:0%
violate the rights of citizens
 
01:47:43.270 --> 01:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
all in all a win-win
 
01:47:45.109 --> 01:47:45.119 align:start position:0%

01:47:56.070 --> 01:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
representative burch who who has the
 
01:47:58.550 --> 01:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
immunity is it the governmental entity
 
01:48:00.629 --> 01:48:00.639 align:start position:0%
that has the qualified immunity or is it
 
01:48:03.590 --> 01:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
the individual employee
 
01:48:05.910 --> 01:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
far as i know and i think others will
 
01:48:07.830 --> 01:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
will be more expert on this deny it's
 
01:48:10.149 --> 01:48:10.159 align:start position:0%
the government employee at the current
 
01:48:10.159 --> 01:48:11.669 align:start position:0%
the government employee at the current
currently

01:48:11.669 --> 01:48:11.679 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:48:13.910 --> 01:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
the employee i think could be suits
 
01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:17.350 align:start position:0%
the employee i think could be suits
personally

01:48:17.350 --> 01:48:17.360 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair thank you
 
01:48:22.070 --> 01:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question if
 
01:48:24.550 --> 01:48:24.560 align:start position:0%
this passes wouldn't the government
 
01:48:26.709 --> 01:48:26.719 align:start position:0%
agencies be covered by insurance just
 
01:48:30.950 --> 01:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:33.030 --> 01:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
normally i would say yes there's a fair
 
01:48:35.750 --> 01:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
amount in new hampshire of self
 
01:48:37.189 --> 01:48:37.199 align:start position:0%

towns and municipalities but yes i i
 
01:48:42.470 --> 01:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
suspect a uh
 
01:48:43.990 --> 01:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
percentage i don't know how large a
 
01:48:46.950 --> 01:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
percentage of these costs would be
 
01:48:48.310 --> 01:48:48.320 align:start position:0%
covered by
 
01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:49.510 align:start position:0%
covered by

i know especially for me uh thank you mr
 
01:49:58.550 --> 01:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
chairman my name is jill bisonette i'm a
 
01:50:01.030 --> 01:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
legal director for the aclu
 
01:50:02.629 --> 01:50:02.639 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
01:50:05.109 --> 01:50:05.119 align:start position:0%
i'm here to testify in support of the
 
01:50:07.109 --> 01:50:07.119 align:start position:0%
concept behind hb
 
01:50:07.119 --> 01:50:08.470 align:start position:0%
concept behind hb
111

01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
111
 
01:50:10.790 --> 01:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
the aclu is historically supported the
 
01:50:13.030 --> 01:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
end of the doctrine called qualified
 
01:50:15.510 --> 01:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
immunity that immunizes police officers
 
01:50:18.390 --> 01:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
from liability uh even when there's been
 
01:50:21.350 --> 01:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
a constitutional violation the bill does
 
01:50:23.669 --> 01:50:23.679 align:start position:0%
two things that i just want to flag
 
01:50:25.990 --> 01:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
for the committee
 
01:50:28.149 --> 01:50:28.159 align:start position:0%
first is
 
01:50:31.189 --> 01:50:31.199 align:start position:0%
this bill would actually create a cause
 
01:50:33.590 --> 01:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
of action for damages
 
01:50:35.910 --> 01:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
when a state or local police officer
 
01:50:37.830 --> 01:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
violates the new hom the new hampshire
 
01:50:41.189 --> 01:50:41.199 align:start position:0%
constitution and in so doing causes harm
 
01:50:43.350 --> 01:50:43.360 align:start position:0%
to a person and why i think that's
 
01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:44.310 align:start position:0%
to a person and why i think that's
important

01:50:44.310 --> 01:50:44.320 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:50:46.550 --> 01:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
is because currently if a state
 
01:50:48.790 --> 01:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
or local police officer violates the new
 
01:50:50.709 --> 01:50:50.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire constitution and as a result
 
01:50:52.390 --> 01:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
causes damage to a person there's
 
01:50:54.629 --> 01:50:54.639 align:start position:0%
actually no recognized
 
01:50:56.870 --> 01:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
cause of action to seek damages in the
 
01:50:59.350 --> 01:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
courts for that violation of the new
 
01:51:00.709 --> 01:51:00.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire constitution so this
 
01:51:02.550 --> 01:51:02.560 align:start position:0%
legislation would actually remedy this
 
01:51:05.189 --> 01:51:05.199 align:start position:0%
problem and i think in so doing
 
01:51:07.430 --> 01:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
would make local police departments
 
01:51:09.350 --> 01:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
and police officers more accountable to
 
01:51:10.950 --> 01:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
granite staters under the new hampshire
 
01:51:12.709 --> 01:51:12.719 align:start position:0%
constitution and also into doing i think
 
01:51:15.030 --> 01:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
would build greater public trust because
 
01:51:16.390 --> 01:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
after all
 
01:51:17.990 --> 01:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
you know what good are the independent
 
01:51:19.430 --> 01:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
protections of the new hampshire
 
01:51:21.270 --> 01:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
constitution if someone can't sue for
 
01:51:22.950 --> 01:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
damages when
 
01:51:24.790 --> 01:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
these protections are violated and
 
01:51:26.950 --> 01:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
damages caused so that's the first point
 
01:51:29.270 --> 01:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to to raise
 
01:51:32.310 --> 01:51:32.320 align:start position:0%
and second as representative burch noted
 
01:51:34.070 --> 01:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
in creating this cause of action this
 
01:51:36.310 --> 01:51:36.320 align:start position:0%
bill would eliminate qualified immunity
 
01:51:39.109 --> 01:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
as a defense to uh to this cause of
 
01:51:39.119 --> 01:51:40.790 align:start position:0%
as a defense to uh to this cause of
action

01:51:40.790 --> 01:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
action
 
01:51:42.790 --> 01:51:42.800 align:start position:0%
you know a public distrust of law
 
01:51:44.390 --> 01:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement really could be attributed
 
01:51:46.550 --> 01:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
to a single thing i think it likely
 
01:51:48.870 --> 01:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
would be just how common it is for
 
01:51:51.270 --> 01:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
an officer to evade uh legal
 
01:51:53.109 --> 01:51:53.119 align:start position:0%
accountability for violating someone's
 
01:51:54.790 --> 01:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights particularly in
 
01:51:57.669 --> 01:51:57.679 align:start position:0%
cases where where forced is used
 
01:52:00.709 --> 01:52:00.719 align:start position:0%
this policy that um you know really at
 
01:52:02.229 --> 01:52:02.239 align:start position:0%
the end of the day prevents officers
 
01:52:05.030 --> 01:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
from being held individually accountable
 
01:52:07.189 --> 01:52:07.199 align:start position:0%
um it you know it exists in new
 
01:52:08.790 --> 01:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire this doctrine applies
 
01:52:10.950 --> 01:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
nationwide and i believe that the public
 
01:52:12.629 --> 01:52:12.639 align:start position:0%
really has a difficult time believing
 
01:52:14.390 --> 01:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
that law enforcement is committed to
 
01:52:15.990 --> 01:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
accountability when its members are
 
01:52:18.390 --> 01:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
shielded from individual accountability
 
01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
even when they violate a person's
 
01:52:23.270 --> 01:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
rights so what's the end result
 
01:52:24.870 --> 01:52:24.880 align:start position:0%
of this doctrine
 
01:52:26.550 --> 01:52:26.560 align:start position:0%
individuals who are the subject of
 
01:52:28.390 --> 01:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
constitutional violations are not
 
01:52:30.790 --> 01:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
compensated that's a big deal that's a
 
01:52:32.550 --> 01:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
huge trade-off
 
01:52:34.070 --> 01:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
in the system that we currently have
 
01:52:37.510 --> 01:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
where qualified immunity operates and i
 
01:52:39.270 --> 01:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
think an additional trade-off is that
 
01:52:41.830 --> 01:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
the appropriate incentives may not uh
 
01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:43.270 align:start position:0%
the appropriate incentives may not uh
exist

01:52:43.270 --> 01:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
exist
 
01:52:45.510 --> 01:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
because of this doctrine
 
01:52:47.830 --> 01:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
you know to encourage uh full and
 
01:52:49.589 --> 01:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
complete compliance with state
 
01:52:51.510 --> 01:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights
 
01:52:53.189 --> 01:52:53.199 align:start position:0%
so we don't believe qualified immunity
 
01:52:54.790 --> 01:52:54.800 align:start position:0%
should exist as a defense for civil
 
01:52:56.310 --> 01:52:56.320 align:start position:0%
rights violations committed by the
 
01:52:58.550 --> 01:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
police and again this bill would address
 
01:53:00.070 --> 01:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
this i want to be clear though by
 
01:53:02.310 --> 01:53:02.320 align:start position:0%
eliminating qualified immunity
 
01:53:05.430 --> 01:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
an officer you know i will still uh have
 
01:53:08.229 --> 01:53:08.239 align:start position:0%
uh his or her day in court um you know
 
01:53:10.790 --> 01:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
to argue that no constitutional
 
01:53:12.629 --> 01:53:12.639 align:start position:0%
violation occurred the problem with
 
01:53:15.030 --> 01:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity is it really shuts
 
01:53:17.750 --> 01:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
the door on plaintiffs where ultimately
 
01:53:19.910 --> 01:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
there may be a finding down the line
 
01:53:22.550 --> 01:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
that there was actually a constitutional
 
01:53:24.390 --> 01:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
violation so that again is the real
 
01:53:26.550 --> 01:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
concern we have and the significant
 
01:53:28.390 --> 01:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
trade-offs that exist with respect to
 
01:53:30.310 --> 01:53:30.320 align:start position:0%
the qualified immunity doctrine as it
 
01:53:31.669 --> 01:53:31.679 align:start position:0%
exists under
 
01:53:31.679 --> 01:53:32.629 align:start position:0%
exists under
uh

01:53:32.629 --> 01:53:32.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:53:34.870 --> 01:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
under the law here in new hampshire so
 
01:53:36.390 --> 01:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
with that i'll conclude my testimony
 
01:53:39.830 --> 01:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman can i be happy to
 
01:53:41.510 --> 01:53:41.520 align:start position:0%

01:53:44.950 --> 01:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:49.990 --> 01:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:52.870 --> 01:53:52.880 align:start position:0%

morrison i am a lieutenant with the
 
01:54:19.430 --> 01:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
londonderry police department and i've
 
01:54:21.589 --> 01:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
been a certified law enforcement officer
 
01:54:23.510 --> 01:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
for over 22 years
 
01:54:26.390 --> 01:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
but i speak to you today in my capacity
 
01:54:27.830 --> 01:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
as the president of the new hampshire
 
01:54:30.149 --> 01:54:30.159 align:start position:0%
police association in opposition to this
 
01:54:30.159 --> 01:54:31.030 align:start position:0%
police association in opposition to this
bill

01:54:31.030 --> 01:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:54:32.629 --> 01:54:32.639 align:start position:0%
and i would urge every member to vote
 
01:54:35.189 --> 01:54:35.199 align:start position:0%
this bill is inexpedient to legislate
 
01:54:37.750 --> 01:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
this past year i was privileged to be
 
01:54:39.669 --> 01:54:39.679 align:start position:0%
named to the governor sununu's
 
01:54:41.189 --> 01:54:41.199 align:start position:0%
commission on law enforcement
 
01:54:42.470 --> 01:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
accountability community and
 
01:54:42.480 --> 01:54:44.149 align:start position:0%
accountability community and
transparency

01:54:44.149 --> 01:54:44.159 align:start position:0%
transparency
 
01:54:45.990 --> 01:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
you have no doubt heard a lot about this
 
01:54:48.790 --> 01:54:48.800 align:start position:0%
commission and the months-long effort it
 
01:54:50.629 --> 01:54:50.639 align:start position:0%
involved coming up with recommendations
 
01:54:52.229 --> 01:54:52.239 align:start position:0%
to further improve
 
01:54:53.750 --> 01:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
what is already a great product for new
 
01:54:55.910 --> 01:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire citizens that of new hampshire
 
01:54:57.510 --> 01:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
law enforcement
 
01:54:59.270 --> 01:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
during those months of testimony we had
 
01:55:01.430 --> 01:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
people testify on the topic of qualified
 
01:55:03.109 --> 01:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
and official immunity
 
01:55:05.350 --> 01:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
to include some very talented folks who
 
01:55:07.990 --> 01:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
would see a windfall in clients should
 
01:55:10.149 --> 01:55:10.159 align:start position:0%
the law change
 
01:55:12.470 --> 01:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
we also heard how devastating to the
 
01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:13.430 align:start position:0%
we also heard how devastating to the
function

01:55:13.430 --> 01:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
function
 
01:55:15.510 --> 01:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
of not just law enforcement but to the
 
01:55:17.189 --> 01:55:17.199 align:start position:0%
overall ability of our government to
 
01:55:19.669 --> 01:55:19.679 align:start position:0%
govern that these changes
 
01:55:19.679 --> 01:55:20.870 align:start position:0%
govern that these changes
be

01:55:20.870 --> 01:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
the result from the the leak commission
 
01:55:25.109 --> 01:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
on this issue
 
01:55:26.950 --> 01:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
was the responsible one
 
01:55:29.350 --> 01:55:29.360 align:start position:0%
which was to reject the suggestions to
 
01:55:31.830 --> 01:55:31.840 align:start position:0%
change the immunity laws and make no
 
01:55:35.109 --> 01:55:35.119 align:start position:0%
recommendation to modify the law
 
01:55:36.950 --> 01:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
this bill should be rejected in the very
 
01:55:38.550 --> 01:55:38.560 align:start position:0%
same way
 
01:55:40.229 --> 01:55:40.239 align:start position:0%
today there is currently an adequate
 
01:55:42.390 --> 01:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
remedy at law for cases where government
 
01:55:45.350 --> 01:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
employees act in a reckless or wanton
 
01:55:47.510 --> 01:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
manner while making discretionary
 
01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:49.030 align:start position:0%
manner while making discretionary
decisions

01:55:49.030 --> 01:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
01:55:51.030 --> 01:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
if employees are found to have performed
 
01:55:53.830 --> 01:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
their job in that reckless or wonton
 
01:55:56.229 --> 01:55:56.239 align:start position:0%
manner while making discretionary
 
01:55:56.239 --> 01:55:57.430 align:start position:0%
manner while making discretionary
decisions

01:55:57.430 --> 01:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
01:55:59.750 --> 01:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
they are not entitled to qualified or
 
01:56:01.669 --> 01:56:01.679 align:start position:0%
official immunity
 
01:56:04.390 --> 01:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
this standard which is a sensible one
 
01:56:06.470 --> 01:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
must remain intact
 
01:56:08.149 --> 01:56:08.159 align:start position:0%
to protect those who put their lives at
 
01:56:10.149 --> 01:56:10.159 align:start position:0%
risk every day for the public
 
01:56:12.790 --> 01:56:12.800 align:start position:0%
while still allowing for the rare worst
 
01:56:14.310 --> 01:56:14.320 align:start position:0%
case scenario to be addressed with
 
01:56:14.320 --> 01:56:15.990 align:start position:0%
case scenario to be addressed with
litigation

01:56:15.990 --> 01:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
litigation
 
01:56:18.310 --> 01:56:18.320 align:start position:0%
if any changes to this body of law are
 
01:56:20.870 --> 01:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
made the difficulties that we face as a
 
01:56:20.880 --> 01:56:22.229 align:start position:0%
made the difficulties that we face as a
profession

01:56:22.229 --> 01:56:22.239 align:start position:0%
profession
 
01:56:24.550 --> 01:56:24.560 align:start position:0%
to recruit and retain officers will be
 
01:56:26.870 --> 01:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
exponentially exacerbated
 
01:56:29.669 --> 01:56:29.679 align:start position:0%
it has been said many times that we as
 
01:56:32.149 --> 01:56:32.159 align:start position:0%
officers are willing to put our lives on
 
01:56:34.629 --> 01:56:34.639 align:start position:0%
the line to protect and serve complete
 
01:56:34.639 --> 01:56:35.830 align:start position:0%
the line to protect and serve complete
strangers

01:56:35.830 --> 01:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
strangers
 
01:56:38.070 --> 01:56:38.080 align:start position:0%
people we have never met and may never
 
01:56:39.830 --> 01:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
meet again for the good of our
 
01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:41.270 align:start position:0%
meet again for the good of our
communities

01:56:41.270 --> 01:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:56:43.430 --> 01:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
what we are not willing to do however is
 
01:56:45.510 --> 01:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
to traumatize our families with economic
 
01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:46.470 align:start position:0%
to traumatize our families with economic
risk

01:56:46.470 --> 01:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
risk
 
01:56:48.950 --> 01:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
they already go through enough
 
01:56:50.709 --> 01:56:50.719 align:start position:0%
this legislation have passed will harm
 
01:56:52.229 --> 01:56:52.239 align:start position:0%
our state in a way
 
01:56:54.870 --> 01:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
few other legislative decisions could
 
01:56:57.030 --> 01:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
the paralysis that would lay siege to
 
01:56:59.030 --> 01:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
local city and state governments as they
 
01:57:00.870 --> 01:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
are forced to hold all their business in
 
01:57:03.350 --> 01:57:03.360 align:start position:0%
order to respond to what will surely be
 
01:57:05.350 --> 01:57:05.360 align:start position:0%
a flood of litigation would be
 
01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:07.350 align:start position:0%
a flood of litigation would be
substantial

01:57:07.350 --> 01:57:07.360 align:start position:0%
substantial
 
01:57:09.270 --> 01:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
any decision that is of a discretionary
 
01:57:12.390 --> 01:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
nature will be open to litigation
 
01:57:14.470 --> 01:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
any decision that is of a discretionary
 
01:57:16.870 --> 01:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
nature will be open to litigation
 
01:57:19.189 --> 01:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
this will harm every regular citizen of
 
01:57:22.310 --> 01:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
our state by necessitating tax increases
 
01:57:24.470 --> 01:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
to deal with frivolous litigation
 
01:57:27.030 --> 01:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
that will make trial lawyers very rich
 
01:57:28.709 --> 01:57:28.719 align:start position:0%
while at the same time
 
01:57:30.470 --> 01:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
discourage anyone from serving in a
 
01:57:33.030 --> 01:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
government job
 
01:57:35.669 --> 01:57:35.679 align:start position:0%
i i would like to briefly respond to a
 
01:57:38.149 --> 01:57:38.159 align:start position:0%
couple of things that were said
 
01:57:39.750 --> 01:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
first i appreciate representative
 
01:57:41.910 --> 01:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
welch's sentiments that more training is
 
01:57:41.920 --> 01:57:42.870 align:start position:0%
welch's sentiments that more training is
needed

01:57:42.870 --> 01:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
needed
 
01:57:45.270 --> 01:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
and law enforcement is always open to
 
01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:46.229 align:start position:0%
and law enforcement is always open to
that

01:57:46.229 --> 01:57:46.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:57:48.550 --> 01:57:48.560 align:start position:0%
as you can see from the recommendations
 
01:57:51.109 --> 01:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
with leak
 
01:57:55.030 --> 01:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
our job essentially involves violation
 
01:57:57.910 --> 01:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
of people's rights every time we seize
 
01:58:00.229 --> 01:58:00.239 align:start position:0%
something or arrest somebody
 
01:58:02.790 --> 01:58:02.800 align:start position:0%
it's a constitutional violation but it's
 
01:58:05.750 --> 01:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
permissible by what our job is
 
01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:06.550 align:start position:0%
permissible by what our job is
so

01:58:06.550 --> 01:58:06.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:58:09.990 --> 01:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
the split second decisions that we make
 
01:58:11.750 --> 01:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
are made during life-threatening
 
01:58:11.760 --> 01:58:13.430 align:start position:0%
are made during life-threatening
circumstances

01:58:13.430 --> 01:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
01:58:16.070 --> 01:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
in low lighting in the rain
 
01:58:17.750 --> 01:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
under physical stress
 
01:58:20.709 --> 01:58:20.719 align:start position:0%
flashing lights dealing with knives guns
 
01:58:22.709 --> 01:58:22.719 align:start position:0%
fists and any other weapons
 
01:58:24.790 --> 01:58:24.800 align:start position:0%
known or unknown
 
01:58:26.390 --> 01:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
i really don't know that a fair
 
01:58:28.229 --> 01:58:28.239 align:start position:0%
comparison can be made
 
01:58:28.239 --> 01:58:29.350 align:start position:0%
comparison can be made
to

01:58:29.350 --> 01:58:29.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:58:31.430 --> 01:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
you know an attorney making a split
 
01:58:35.189 --> 01:58:35.199 align:start position:0%
second decision or a doctor and
 
01:58:37.510 --> 01:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
doctors i don't think are normally
 
01:58:39.910 --> 01:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
criminally charged with assault you know
 
01:58:43.030 --> 01:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
for making a mistake during surgery
 
01:58:45.109 --> 01:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
so i know time is short and there are
 
01:58:47.189 --> 01:58:47.199 align:start position:0%
other speakers to hear so i'll simply
 
01:58:49.589 --> 01:58:49.599 align:start position:0%
leave you with the position that nhpa is
 
01:58:51.669 --> 01:58:51.679 align:start position:0%
in strict opposition to this bill
 
01:58:52.950 --> 01:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your time and
 
01:58:52.960 --> 01:58:54.070 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your time and
attention

01:58:54.070 --> 01:58:54.080 align:start position:0%
attention
 
01:58:56.470 --> 01:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr morrison and representative
 
01:58:58.229 --> 01:58:58.239 align:start position:0%
smith do you have a question
 
01:59:01.030 --> 01:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you uh very much mr chair
 
01:59:03.430 --> 01:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
and thank you mr morrison for being
 
01:59:05.910 --> 01:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
willing to answer um
 
01:59:07.990 --> 01:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
questions i do have a couple of
 
01:59:10.070 --> 01:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
questions for you and i don't expect you
 
01:59:13.510 --> 01:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
to be able to answer them right now
 
01:59:14.830 --> 01:59:14.840 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you'll have to do a little
 
01:59:18.310 --> 01:59:18.320 align:start position:0%
research but i was quite taken by the
 
01:59:22.070 --> 01:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
strength of your testimony and so i
 
01:59:25.669 --> 01:59:25.679 align:start position:0%
would like to have the documentation
 
01:59:29.510 --> 01:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:29.520 --> 01:59:31.510 align:start position:0%
 
windfalls

01:59:31.510 --> 01:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
windfalls
 
01:59:33.589 --> 01:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
uh in
 
01:59:36.629 --> 01:59:36.639 align:start position:0%
to in in more clients flood of
 
01:59:36.639 --> 01:59:38.390 align:start position:0%
to in in more clients flood of
litigation

01:59:38.390 --> 01:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
litigation
 
01:59:40.709 --> 01:59:40.719 align:start position:0%
tax increases
 
01:59:45.510 --> 01:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
um and um i'd also like to know the um
 
01:59:48.950 --> 01:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
the number of specific cases where
 
01:59:50.709 --> 01:59:50.719 align:start position:0%
knives guns
 
01:59:54.149 --> 01:59:54.159 align:start position:0%
and darkness of night were involved in
 
01:59:55.430 --> 01:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
bringing you
 
01:59:55.440 --> 01:59:56.310 align:start position:0%
bringing you
to

01:59:56.310 --> 01:59:56.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:59:58.390 --> 01:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
state as facts
 
01:59:59.910 --> 01:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
all those things that you did i don't
 
02:00:02.390 --> 02:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
expect you to answer now but if you
 
02:00:05.109 --> 02:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
could get back to us um
 
02:00:09.350 --> 02:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:11.910 --> 02:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative smith i'll be
 
02:00:14.149 --> 02:00:14.159 align:start position:0%
happy to get some of that for you
 
02:00:16.950 --> 02:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
and my comments are
 
02:00:18.070 --> 02:00:18.080 align:start position:0%
meant to
 
02:00:18.080 --> 02:00:19.589 align:start position:0%
meant to
articulate

02:00:19.589 --> 02:00:19.599 align:start position:0%
articulate
 
02:00:22.310 --> 02:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
what situations we do make
 
02:00:24.390 --> 02:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
those decisions in
 
02:00:26.709 --> 02:00:26.719 align:start position:0%
that is not every decision made in
 
02:00:29.510 --> 02:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
exactly that scenario but those are
 
02:00:31.910 --> 02:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
exactly the types of conditions that you
 
02:00:33.109 --> 02:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
can find
 
02:00:34.790 --> 02:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
officers making these split-second
 
02:00:37.030 --> 02:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
decisions i'm not quite sure there needs
 
02:00:40.149 --> 02:00:40.159 align:start position:0%
to be more documentation on that the the
 
02:00:42.550 --> 02:00:42.560 align:start position:0%
flood of litigation that
 
02:00:44.149 --> 02:00:44.159 align:start position:0%
i referred to
 
02:00:45.430 --> 02:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
is simply
 
02:00:46.629 --> 02:00:46.639 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:00:48.950 --> 02:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
with the protections of qualified
 
02:00:51.510 --> 02:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
immunity or official immunity
 
02:00:55.270 --> 02:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
the lawsuits need to be disposed of as
 
02:00:57.990 --> 02:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
early as possible in the legal
 
02:00:58.000 --> 02:00:59.189 align:start position:0%
early as possible in the legal
situation

02:00:59.189 --> 02:00:59.199 align:start position:0%
situation
 
02:01:01.669 --> 02:01:01.679 align:start position:0%
you know when it when they're filed
 
02:01:03.750 --> 02:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
if that isn't there
 
02:01:06.390 --> 02:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
there will no doubt be more hearings
 
02:01:09.189 --> 02:01:09.199 align:start position:0%
there will no doubt be more people that
 
02:01:12.229 --> 02:01:12.239 align:start position:0%
will have the ability to bring
 
02:01:13.830 --> 02:01:13.840 align:start position:0%
lawsuits for any
 
02:01:16.470 --> 02:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
discretionary decision made not just by
 
02:01:18.070 --> 02:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
police officers
 
02:01:19.189 --> 02:01:19.199 align:start position:0%
but by
 
02:01:21.589 --> 02:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
anybody fixing a road or
 
02:01:23.430 --> 02:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
any of the other government
 
02:01:25.589 --> 02:01:25.599 align:start position:0%
uh sort of
 
02:01:28.229 --> 02:01:28.239 align:start position:0%
jobs that are conducted i don't know
 
02:01:30.629 --> 02:01:30.639 align:start position:0%
that you know documentation needs to be
 
02:01:32.229 --> 02:01:32.239 align:start position:0%
provided for that
 
02:01:34.189 --> 02:01:34.199 align:start position:0%
as it's just simply a
 
02:01:37.589 --> 02:01:37.599 align:start position:0%
a clear scenario of what would happen
 
02:01:37.599 --> 02:01:39.510 align:start position:0%
a clear scenario of what would happen
okay

02:01:39.510 --> 02:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:01:42.470 --> 02:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
are you all set representative smith
 
02:01:44.709 --> 02:01:44.719 align:start position:0%
well um
 
02:01:45.830 --> 02:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't think there's anything to
 
02:01:47.990 --> 02:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
be gained by by following up i think
 
02:01:50.709 --> 02:01:50.719 align:start position:0%
those statements were made um in very
 
02:01:53.669 --> 02:01:53.679 align:start position:0%
strong language presented as facts and
 
02:01:56.149 --> 02:01:56.159 align:start position:0%
out of respect for mr morrison i just
 
02:01:58.550 --> 02:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to have the documentation of the
 
02:02:00.950 --> 02:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
facts that he presented to us thank you
 
02:02:02.709 --> 02:02:02.719 align:start position:0%

point made so
 
02:02:06.229 --> 02:02:06.239 align:start position:0%

are there any other questions for mr
morrison

02:02:09.270 --> 02:02:09.280 align:start position:0%

the committee for holding this hearing
today

02:02:37.430 --> 02:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:02:38.950 --> 02:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
just for the record my name is ross

hampshire

02:02:43.589 --> 02:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:02:46.070 --> 02:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
and i'm here to voice our support for hb
 
02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:47.830 align:start position:0%
and i'm here to voice our support for hb
111

02:02:47.830 --> 02:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
111
 
02:02:49.830 --> 02:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
currently there are very few avenues to
 
02:02:52.229 --> 02:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
hold accountable government agencies who
 
02:02:53.750 --> 02:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
have violated granite staters
 
02:02:55.669 --> 02:02:55.679 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights
 
02:02:57.669 --> 02:02:57.679 align:start position:0%
and as we've heard a big reason for this
 
02:03:00.390 --> 02:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
is the doctrine of qualified immunity
 
02:03:02.149 --> 02:03:02.159 align:start position:0%
this is a court-created doctrine that
 
02:03:03.910 --> 02:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
gives immunity to government officials
 
02:03:06.470 --> 02:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
from possible soup in a wide range of
 
02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:07.430 align:start position:0%
from possible soup in a wide range of
issues

02:03:07.430 --> 02:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
issues
 
02:03:09.109 --> 02:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
essentially making them immune to
 
02:03:12.470 --> 02:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
accountability from these the citizenry
 
02:03:14.709 --> 02:03:14.719 align:start position:0%
hb 111 would bring much needed
 
02:03:17.109 --> 02:03:17.119 align:start position:0%
accountability to government agencies
 
02:03:19.030 --> 02:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
this bill would not cause a flood of
 
02:03:21.510 --> 02:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
lawsuits or many of the issues seen in
 
02:03:25.109 --> 02:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
states like colorado because hb 111 does
 
02:03:27.109 --> 02:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
not allow for legal action against an
 
02:03:30.149 --> 02:03:30.159 align:start position:0%
employee only the employer in this case
 
02:03:32.390 --> 02:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
a government agency
 
02:03:34.390 --> 02:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
this change will incentivize government
 
02:03:36.550 --> 02:03:36.560 align:start position:0%
entities to ensure their policies and
 
02:03:36.560 --> 02:03:37.589 align:start position:0%
entities to ensure their policies and
training

02:03:37.589 --> 02:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
training
 
02:03:39.430 --> 02:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
do not create the potential for a
 
02:03:42.470 --> 02:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
violation of individual rights
 
02:03:44.149 --> 02:03:44.159 align:start position:0%
i think we all should be able to agree
 
02:03:46.709 --> 02:03:46.719 align:start position:0%
that bad actors no matter who they are
 
02:03:48.550 --> 02:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
or who they work for
 
02:03:50.310 --> 02:03:50.320 align:start position:0%
should be held to the same standard as
 
02:03:52.149 --> 02:03:52.159 align:start position:0%
everybody else
 
02:03:54.229 --> 02:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
and as we've seen this is a bipartisan
 
02:03:56.629 --> 02:03:56.639 align:start position:0%
solution to bring accountability to all
 
02:03:59.109 --> 02:03:59.119 align:start position:0%
government and not and and does not
 
02:04:02.470 --> 02:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
single out a single uh government agency
 
02:04:04.550 --> 02:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
or employees
 
02:04:06.950 --> 02:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
a recent gallup poll conducted in
 
02:04:09.990 --> 02:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
september 2020 showed only 20 percent 21
 
02:04:12.070 --> 02:04:12.080 align:start position:0%
percent of the public having a very
 
02:04:15.030 --> 02:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
strong trust in their state government
 
02:04:16.709 --> 02:04:16.719 align:start position:0%
the public's trust in the core
 
02:04:19.350 --> 02:04:19.360 align:start position:0%
institutions of society is waning and it
 
02:04:21.189 --> 02:04:21.199 align:start position:0%
is even worse when asked about
 
02:04:23.109 --> 02:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
individual agencies
 
02:04:25.030 --> 02:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
and it is critical from our perspective
 
02:04:27.350 --> 02:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
that that trust is restored
 
02:04:29.270 --> 02:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
with these accountability measures hb
 
02:04:30.950 --> 02:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
111 will help
 
02:04:32.870 --> 02:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
improve granite staters confidence that
 
02:04:35.270 --> 02:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
their government supports them and when
 
02:04:38.229 --> 02:04:38.239 align:start position:0%
it doesn't they have proper recourse
 
02:04:38.239 --> 02:04:39.030 align:start position:0%
it doesn't they have proper recourse
this

02:04:39.030 --> 02:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:04:41.030 --> 02:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
legislation brings together groups from
 
02:04:43.430 --> 02:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
all over the political spectrum who
 
02:04:45.350 --> 02:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
recognize the need for citizen rights to
 
02:04:47.990 --> 02:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
be upheld and defended and for these
 
02:04:50.470 --> 02:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
reasons we urge the committee to move hb
 
02:04:53.030 --> 02:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
111 ought to pass and i'd be happy to
 
02:04:55.830 --> 02:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
take any questions if there are any
 
02:04:59.510 --> 02:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for mr connolly
 
02:05:02.790 --> 02:05:02.800 align:start position:0%
yes representative mclean
 
02:05:05.109 --> 02:05:05.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
02:05:08.550 --> 02:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
mr conley you you mentioned colorado has
 
02:05:12.790 --> 02:05:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:16.310 --> 02:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh uh i i mentioned colorado
 
02:05:18.950 --> 02:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
since uh they got a lot of attention for
 
02:05:21.830 --> 02:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
for passing a qualified immunity bill
 
02:05:24.390 --> 02:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
that their legislation uh puts the
 
02:05:27.109 --> 02:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
burden of proof on the employee is my
 
02:05:29.189 --> 02:05:29.199 align:start position:0%
understanding not the employer
 
02:05:31.830 --> 02:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh which from our perspective
 
02:05:34.550 --> 02:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh incentivized
 
02:05:36.229 --> 02:05:36.239 align:start position:0%
has the wrong incentives when you put
 
02:05:38.550 --> 02:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
the burden on the employee then it could
 
02:05:40.550 --> 02:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
result in and what the the previous
 
02:05:43.189 --> 02:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
speaker was saying of officers
 
02:05:45.750 --> 02:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
potentially changing their behavior uh
 
02:05:48.070 --> 02:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
when conducting arrests if the burden of
 
02:05:51.189 --> 02:05:51.199 align:start position:0%
proof is or the burden is put on the
 
02:05:54.709 --> 02:05:54.719 align:start position:0%
agency and the employer then uh the the
 
02:05:56.950 --> 02:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
incentive is to change
 
02:05:59.510 --> 02:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
the agency's policies and the agency's
 
02:05:59.520 --> 02:06:00.470 align:start position:0%
the agency's policies and the agency's
training

02:06:00.470 --> 02:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
training
 
02:06:03.830 --> 02:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh instead of uh the individual actions
 
02:06:07.030 --> 02:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
of the the employee
 
02:06:09.910 --> 02:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
good follow-up mr chair certainly
 
02:06:12.709 --> 02:06:12.719 align:start position:0%
so in the case of colorado where they
 
02:06:14.390 --> 02:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
really actually
 
02:06:16.229 --> 02:06:16.239 align:start position:0%
it's different where they went after the
 
02:06:20.229 --> 02:06:20.239 align:start position:0%
employee did they see any impact there
 
02:06:23.430 --> 02:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
with respect to recruitment or anything
 
02:06:25.750 --> 02:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
in that situation um because that would
 
02:06:28.550 --> 02:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
be i think even a more severe case than
 
02:06:30.069 --> 02:06:30.079 align:start position:0%
we would be looking at here in new
 
02:06:30.079 --> 02:06:31.750 align:start position:0%
we would be looking at here in new
hampshire

02:06:31.750 --> 02:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:06:34.310 --> 02:06:34.320 align:start position:0%
i i do not uh have that information
 
02:06:37.750 --> 02:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately uh i i will defer to later
 
02:06:40.149 --> 02:06:40.159 align:start position:0%
speakers who may be attorneys i am not
 
02:06:43.750 --> 02:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
an attorney um but i uh if that question
 
02:06:45.510 --> 02:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
is not answered i'll certainly follow up
 
02:06:47.510 --> 02:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
with the committee and and provide that
 
02:06:47.520 --> 02:06:48.790 align:start position:0%
with the committee and and provide that
information

02:06:48.790 --> 02:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:06:52.629 --> 02:06:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:54.229 --> 02:06:54.239 align:start position:0%

the department of health and services
 
02:08:07.510 --> 02:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
appreciates the opportunity to comment
 
02:08:10.229 --> 02:08:10.239 align:start position:0%
on the proposed legislation
 
02:08:12.390 --> 02:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh and today we are limiting our
 
02:08:14.790 --> 02:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
testimony to a request for a fiscal
 
02:08:17.430 --> 02:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
analysis on this legislation
 
02:08:19.669 --> 02:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
and as many many of you may be aware
 
02:08:21.030 --> 02:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
under rsa
 
02:08:24.790 --> 02:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
14 colon 44 roman i which falls under
 
02:08:26.390 --> 02:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
the legislative budget assistance
 
02:08:28.790 --> 02:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
statute it provides that all bills and
 
02:08:31.270 --> 02:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
resolutions having an effect on revenues
 
02:08:31.280 --> 02:08:32.629 align:start position:0%
resolutions having an effect on revenues
expenditures

02:08:32.629 --> 02:08:32.639 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
02:08:35.270 --> 02:08:35.280 align:start position:0%
or fiscal liability of the state or city
 
02:08:38.310 --> 02:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
or town or county which have a total
 
02:08:41.030 --> 02:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact of 10 000
 
02:08:43.589 --> 02:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
or more in each fiscal year over the
 
02:08:45.990 --> 02:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
period covered by a fiscal note
 
02:08:48.310 --> 02:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
shall be accompanied by a fiscal note
 
02:08:50.310 --> 02:08:50.320 align:start position:0%
which sets forth the estimated fiscal
 
02:08:52.629 --> 02:08:52.639 align:start position:0%
impact thereof
 
02:08:55.589 --> 02:08:55.599 align:start position:0%
and to build on top of that um hb 111
 
02:08:57.910 --> 02:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
does create a new cause of action under
 
02:09:00.629 --> 02:09:00.639 align:start position:0%
state law touching on all branches of
 
02:09:02.830 --> 02:09:02.840 align:start position:0%
state government and its political
 
02:09:06.149 --> 02:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
subdivisions uh including county and
 
02:09:08.870 --> 02:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
local government um as well as a waiver
 
02:09:10.470 --> 02:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
of sovereign immunity in certain
 
02:09:10.480 --> 02:09:12.149 align:start position:0%
of sovereign immunity in certain
circumstances

02:09:12.149 --> 02:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
02:09:14.950 --> 02:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
and if enacted um house bill 111 is
 
02:09:16.830 --> 02:09:16.840 align:start position:0%
projected to result in increased
 
02:09:19.830 --> 02:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
litigation with anticipated costs uh
 
02:09:22.470 --> 02:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
exceeding the ten thousand dollar or
 
02:09:27.030 --> 02:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
more threshold under rsa-14 calling 44.
 
02:09:31.189 --> 02:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
and as introduced hb 111 does not have a
 
02:09:33.830 --> 02:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact note to provide this
 
02:09:36.550 --> 02:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
honorable committee and the legislature
 
02:09:39.350 --> 02:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
with the necessary information
 
02:09:42.149 --> 02:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
on the budgetary impact related to
 
02:09:44.629 --> 02:09:44.639 align:start position:0%
revenues or expenditure
 
02:09:46.790 --> 02:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
expenditures to the state uh or its
 
02:09:48.790 --> 02:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions that were
 
02:09:50.149 --> 02:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
previously mentioned
 
02:09:54.030 --> 02:09:54.040 align:start position:0%
how however as most of you know on rsa
 
02:09:58.069 --> 02:09:58.079 align:start position:0%
146 romans 5 does provide a remedy and a
 
02:10:00.310 --> 02:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
mechanism to authorize the office of
 
02:10:01.669 --> 02:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
legislative budget assistance to
 
02:10:04.550 --> 02:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
complete a fiscal impact note at this
 
02:10:04.560 --> 02:10:06.470 align:start position:0%
complete a fiscal impact note at this
juncture

02:10:06.470 --> 02:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
juncture
 
02:10:08.629 --> 02:10:08.639 align:start position:0%
and to dovetail with that sub paragraph
 
02:10:11.669 --> 02:10:11.679 align:start position:0%
a under this section provides that a
 
02:10:14.229 --> 02:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
fiscal note may be requested after the
 
02:10:15.910 --> 02:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
introduction of a bill
 
02:10:18.709 --> 02:10:18.719 align:start position:0%
if a majority of a committee to which is
 
02:10:21.270 --> 02:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
referred a bill not containing a fiscal
 
02:10:23.750 --> 02:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
note votes to have one prepared by the
 
02:10:26.069 --> 02:10:26.079 align:start position:0%
legislative budget assistant upon the
 
02:10:29.910 --> 02:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
motion of a member of said committee
 
02:10:33.629 --> 02:10:33.639 align:start position:0%
this completes our testimony on hb
 
02:10:33.639 --> 02:10:35.510 align:start position:0%
this completes our testimony on hb
111

02:10:35.510 --> 02:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
111
 
02:10:36.870 --> 02:10:36.880 align:start position:0%

02:10:39.350 --> 02:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
human services happily remains available
 
02:10:40.709 --> 02:10:40.719 align:start position:0%
as a resource
 
02:10:43.109 --> 02:10:43.119 align:start position:0%
to the house judiciary committee as well
 
02:10:45.350 --> 02:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
as the bill sponsor representative uh
 
02:10:48.550 --> 02:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:49.589 --> 02:10:49.599 align:start position:0%
any other

for mr williams or ms milliner
 
02:10:55.920 --> 02:10:57.510 align:start position:0%

02:10:57.510 --> 02:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:10:57.520 --> 02:10:58.709 align:start position:0%
yes
yes

02:10:58.709 --> 02:10:58.719 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:11:00.550 --> 02:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
02:11:03.830 --> 02:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair um uh thank
 
02:11:06.149 --> 02:11:06.159 align:start position:0%
you very much mr williams and ms mullen

are for testifying are you aware that
 
02:11:13.109 --> 02:11:13.119 align:start position:0%
this is the policy committee um
 
02:11:13.119 --> 02:11:13.990 align:start position:0%
this is the policy committee um
of

02:11:13.990 --> 02:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:11:18.390 --> 02:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
the legislative judiciary and not the
 
02:11:20.390 --> 02:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
finance committee
 
02:11:24.149 --> 02:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
so that the testimony that we
 
02:11:26.390 --> 02:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
would most like to hear from your
 
02:11:28.390 --> 02:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
distinguished department would be the
 
02:11:30.629 --> 02:11:30.639 align:start position:0%
policy questions
 
02:11:30.639 --> 02:11:32.470 align:start position:0%
policy questions
raised

02:11:32.470 --> 02:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
raised
 
02:11:35.430 --> 02:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
and do i assume that since you are
 
02:11:36.950 --> 02:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
choosing to
 
02:11:39.589 --> 02:11:39.599 align:start position:0%
only request that we ask for a fiscal
 
02:11:42.870 --> 02:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
note that you have no problems at all
 
02:11:45.510 --> 02:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
with the policy you're supportive of the
 
02:11:47.750 --> 02:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
policy it's just that you're concerned
 
02:11:49.990 --> 02:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
about the fact that there might be
 
02:11:53.189 --> 02:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
financial implications that uh the
 
02:11:53.199 --> 02:11:54.470 align:start position:0%
financial implications that uh the
appropriate

02:11:54.470 --> 02:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
02:11:57.350 --> 02:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh committee should consider
 
02:11:59.830 --> 02:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
and and mr chair responding to rep
 
02:12:02.310 --> 02:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
smith's question as you'll see from the
 
02:12:05.189 --> 02:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
rsa it doesn't set forth that it has to
 
02:12:07.510 --> 02:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
be a financially related committee in
 
02:12:09.589 --> 02:12:09.599 align:start position:0%
fact a policy committee and also the
 
02:12:09.599 --> 02:12:10.709 align:start position:0%
fact a policy committee and also the
full

02:12:10.709 --> 02:12:10.719 align:start position:0%
full
 
02:12:12.550 --> 02:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
house representatives have the authority
 
02:12:16.390 --> 02:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
to request a fiscal note on legislation
 
02:12:18.069 --> 02:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
and although i would absolutely agree
 
02:12:20.229 --> 02:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
with you represent smith that this is a
 
02:12:22.149 --> 02:12:22.159 align:start position:0%
policy committee and we fully understand
 
02:12:23.510 --> 02:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
and appreciate that
 
02:12:25.350 --> 02:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
for the committee to have the complete
 
02:12:27.350 --> 02:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
picture we do feel it's important for
 
02:12:29.109 --> 02:12:29.119 align:start position:0%
you to have a greater understanding
 
02:12:30.470 --> 02:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
particularly in the year where there's a
 
02:12:32.470 --> 02:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
pandemic we have a budget that's heading
 
02:12:34.550 --> 02:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
before us to understanding what
 
02:12:36.950 --> 02:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
implications there may be around this
 
02:12:40.149 --> 02:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
relative policy initiative we do think
 
02:12:42.229 --> 02:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
and we want to thank and appreciate our
 
02:12:44.069 --> 02:12:44.079 align:start position:0%
conversations that we've had
 
02:12:45.830 --> 02:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
with representative burch he's been very
 
02:12:49.030 --> 02:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
open uh we have expressed some concerns
 
02:12:50.950 --> 02:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
regarding some unanswered questions
 
02:12:53.189 --> 02:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
around the legislation and perhaps other
 
02:12:55.350 --> 02:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
state agencies or others may be weighing
 
02:12:55.360 --> 02:12:56.069 align:start position:0%
state agencies or others may be weighing
in

02:12:56.069 --> 02:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:12:57.910 --> 02:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
on similar concerns regarding for
 
02:12:59.990 --> 02:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
example the scope of the legislation as
 
02:13:02.950 --> 02:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
it impacts all branches of
 
02:13:04.310 --> 02:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
state government as well as the
 
02:13:06.629 --> 02:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions thereof so there
 
02:13:08.550 --> 02:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
are questions regarding how would this
 
02:13:11.189 --> 02:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
relate for example to a state agency
 
02:13:13.990 --> 02:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
like the national guard who as we know
 
02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:14.790 align:start position:0%
like the national guard who as we know
are

02:13:14.790 --> 02:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:13:16.229 --> 02:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
working along with the department of
 
02:13:18.310 --> 02:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
health and services around uh
 
02:13:21.750 --> 02:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
immunization or the code 19. would this
 
02:13:25.030 --> 02:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
expose those particular individuals to
 
02:13:27.030 --> 02:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
a new cause of action within the state
 
02:13:29.109 --> 02:13:29.119 align:start position:0%
and what would the fiscal implication be
 
02:13:30.470 --> 02:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
around that so we do think it would be
 
02:13:32.390 --> 02:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
helpful referee smith for you have this
 
02:13:35.430 --> 02:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
information and i do reflect very fondly
 
02:13:37.430 --> 02:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh on working with you when you were the
 
02:13:39.430 --> 02:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
chair of house finance and also
 
02:13:41.990 --> 02:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
considering the overlap of policy and
 
02:13:44.149 --> 02:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
fiscal implications are very critical
 
02:13:45.589 --> 02:13:45.599 align:start position:0%
and important
 
02:13:47.189 --> 02:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
and i didn't know this moment or had
 
02:13:49.030 --> 02:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
anything else to offer
 
02:13:53.830 --> 02:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
i could just follow up um mr chair uh uh
 
02:13:56.310 --> 02:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
i had i'm not commenting at all on the
 
02:13:58.550 --> 02:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
request for a fiscal note that's a
 
02:14:00.870 --> 02:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
perfectly legitimate uh request for you
 
02:14:03.750 --> 02:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
to make what i am asking is that since
 
02:14:05.910 --> 02:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
you are peering before the judiciary
 
02:14:09.430 --> 02:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
committee where our primary focus
 
02:14:13.430 --> 02:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
is the policy um i still have not heard
 
02:14:16.149 --> 02:14:16.159 align:start position:0%
anything substantive from the department
 
02:14:18.310 --> 02:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
of health and human services about the
 
02:14:18.320 --> 02:14:20.390 align:start position:0%
of health and human services about the
policy

02:14:20.390 --> 02:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
policy
 
02:14:22.069 --> 02:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
and there are
 
02:14:24.229 --> 02:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
i know you've heard me say that when
 
02:14:26.470 --> 02:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
they say it's not the money it's always
 
02:14:29.189 --> 02:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
the money i understand that but the
 
02:14:31.830 --> 02:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
money is based on a policy and i want to
 
02:14:31.840 --> 02:14:33.189 align:start position:0%
money is based on a policy and i want to
know

02:14:33.189 --> 02:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:14:35.990 --> 02:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
what your position is on the policy
 
02:14:38.870 --> 02:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
whether or not this committee chooses to
 
02:14:43.270 --> 02:14:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:45.109 --> 02:14:45.119 align:start position:0%
representative gordon in responding to
 
02:14:47.510 --> 02:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
representatives question the department
 
02:14:49.990 --> 02:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
clearly in registering for our testimony
 
02:14:51.589 --> 02:14:51.599 align:start position:0%
is not taking position on the bill but
 
02:14:53.990 --> 02:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
we do remain a resource to the committee
 
02:14:55.910 --> 02:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
on the underlying legislation either as
 
02:14:57.750 --> 02:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
it might relate to the fiscal
 
02:14:58.870 --> 02:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
implications of the bill because
 
02:15:01.990 --> 02:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
certainly other um entities other
 
02:15:03.910 --> 02:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
departments actually would be likely
 
02:15:05.990 --> 02:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
taking lead on that physical analysis
 
02:15:09.350 --> 02:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
like the department of admin services uh
 
02:15:12.470 --> 02:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
perhaps the other other major uh
 
02:15:14.950 --> 02:15:14.960 align:start position:0%
executive branch um
 
02:15:17.270 --> 02:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
agencies but i do think in responding to
 
02:15:19.189 --> 02:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
your question respectfully represented
 
02:15:21.030 --> 02:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
smith i did outline that there are
 
02:15:23.270 --> 02:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
several unanswered questions that i
 
02:15:25.510 --> 02:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
think do relate to this bill that need
 
02:15:28.629 --> 02:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
further exploration and so with that we
 
02:15:31.109 --> 02:15:31.119 align:start position:0%
remain a resource to this committee to
 
02:15:34.470 --> 02:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
represent birch uh and to others uh as
 
02:15:35.830 --> 02:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
this bill makes its way through the
 
02:15:37.510 --> 02:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
process but we do think it's critical
 
02:15:39.109 --> 02:15:39.119 align:start position:0%
and we thought it was important enough
 
02:15:41.189 --> 02:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
to come here today to at least bring to
 
02:15:44.550 --> 02:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
your attention the request for a fiscal
 
02:15:49.030 --> 02:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:51.030 --> 02:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative simpson did you
 
02:15:53.189 --> 02:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
02:15:55.270 --> 02:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
yes i do thank you mr chair and thank
 
02:15:57.430 --> 02:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
02:15:57.440 --> 02:15:58.310 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
um

02:15:58.310 --> 02:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:59.830 --> 02:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
i'm glad that you presented yourself as
 
02:16:01.109 --> 02:16:01.119 align:start position:0%
a resource because i actually do have a
 
02:16:02.709 --> 02:16:02.719 align:start position:0%
question that i think you might be able
 
02:16:04.149 --> 02:16:04.159 align:start position:0%
to help with and since i've not been
 
02:16:05.750 --> 02:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
privy to your conversations with
 
02:16:08.629 --> 02:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
representative birch i'd like to um ask
 
02:16:08.639 --> 02:16:09.510 align:start position:0%
representative birch i'd like to um ask
it

02:16:09.510 --> 02:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:16:12.950 --> 02:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
earlier in the hearing we heard that um
 
02:16:14.870 --> 02:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
about who sort of makes split-second
 
02:16:16.550 --> 02:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
decision-making in their in their
 
02:16:18.790 --> 02:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
careers and in their jobs and
 
02:16:20.790 --> 02:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
i was thinking about um
 
02:16:22.870 --> 02:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
doctors and surgeons who are often
 
02:16:25.350 --> 02:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
making split split-second decisions as
 
02:16:26.950 --> 02:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
they work and um
 
02:16:29.750 --> 02:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
and are liable for those decisions and
 
02:16:32.389 --> 02:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
in fact have a lot of insurance um in in
 
02:16:35.589 --> 02:16:35.599 align:start position:0%
order to cope with that liability
 
02:16:37.910 --> 02:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
and so i wondered if there if you see
 
02:16:40.309 --> 02:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
any kind of difference
 
02:16:41.589 --> 02:16:41.599 align:start position:0%
in your
 
02:16:44.230 --> 02:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
policy how you look at the policy from
 
02:16:46.389 --> 02:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
the perspective of dhhs
 
02:16:48.309 --> 02:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
then maybe um
 
02:16:50.070 --> 02:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
the police association would look i
 
02:16:51.910 --> 02:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
don't know if insurance is different in
 
02:16:54.870 --> 02:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
the police um i would think it is in
 
02:16:57.669 --> 02:16:57.679 align:start position:0%
some way different in the police
 
02:17:01.110 --> 02:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
than it is in say doctors or nurses
 
02:17:03.349 --> 02:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
um but maybe if you could talk about
 
02:17:06.230 --> 02:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
that at all that would be helpful for me
 
02:17:08.790 --> 02:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
and uh uh mr chair and responding to
 
02:17:10.950 --> 02:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
representative simpson's question
 
02:17:13.110 --> 02:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh you know we do come here today with
 
02:17:14.950 --> 02:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
the lens of the department of health and
 
02:17:18.070 --> 02:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
services and i do understand that from
 
02:17:20.469 --> 02:17:20.479 align:start position:0%
the bills prime sponsored that the at
 
02:17:23.190 --> 02:17:23.200 align:start position:0%
least initial uh intent is to look at
 
02:17:25.190 --> 02:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and perhaps other
 
02:17:28.469 --> 02:17:28.479 align:start position:0%
related areas such as corrections uh so
 
02:17:30.870 --> 02:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
within our agency we certainly interact
 
02:17:32.309 --> 02:17:32.319 align:start position:0%
with a lot of people you're probably
 
02:17:34.070 --> 02:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
aware at new hampshire hospital that we
 
02:17:36.309 --> 02:17:36.319 align:start position:0%
have patients there so from the co from
 
02:17:38.549 --> 02:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
the context of a clinical perspective
 
02:17:40.709 --> 02:17:40.719 align:start position:0%
there are some similarities between uh
 
02:17:44.309 --> 02:17:44.319 align:start position:0%
us and the private sector uh on on many
 
02:17:47.030 --> 02:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
occasions and so uh and i'd have to
 
02:17:48.790 --> 02:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
defer to others and again that's the
 
02:17:50.629 --> 02:17:50.639 align:start position:0%
request for the fiscal analysis being
 
02:17:52.870 --> 02:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
done that it's my understanding and i
 
02:17:54.150 --> 02:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
think there are others you could
 
02:17:56.150 --> 02:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
leverage who would be a better resource
 
02:17:59.190 --> 02:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
than our agency around the issues of the
 
02:18:01.910 --> 02:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
state being self-insured at some point
 
02:18:04.870 --> 02:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
if there are fiscal implications through
 
02:18:07.429 --> 02:18:07.439 align:start position:0%
additional litigation being filed
 
02:18:08.790 --> 02:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
that's the issue that i think is
 
02:18:11.030 --> 02:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
important for at least a part of
 
02:18:12.549 --> 02:18:12.559 align:start position:0%
critical information to come before this
 
02:18:14.549 --> 02:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
committee and assessing whether or not
 
02:18:17.270 --> 02:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
the policy linked up with the fiscal
 
02:18:19.509 --> 02:18:19.519 align:start position:0%
implications makes sense and whether or
 
02:18:22.150 --> 02:18:22.160 align:start position:0%
not you want to re-examine the scope of
 
02:18:24.469 --> 02:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
the overall legislation if it is related
 
02:18:27.270 --> 02:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
to law enforcement for example versus
 
02:18:28.950 --> 02:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
those activities done by the department
 
02:18:30.790 --> 02:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
of health and services in terms of
 
02:18:32.870 --> 02:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
administering services to the public
 
02:18:34.070 --> 02:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
that that would be helpful as part of
 
02:18:38.709 --> 02:18:38.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:40.150 --> 02:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
representative alexander you had your
 
02:18:41.750 --> 02:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
quest you had your hand up at one point
 
02:18:43.270 --> 02:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
in time are you all set
 
02:18:45.750 --> 02:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
i'm all set mr chair thank you
 
02:18:51.110 --> 02:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:53.429 --> 02:18:53.439 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair uh mr
 
02:18:55.270 --> 02:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
williams um
 
02:18:58.309 --> 02:18:58.319 align:start position:0%
i know uh dhhs uh because it's the
 
02:18:59.910 --> 02:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
largest agency in the state and also
 
02:19:01.750 --> 02:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
because of the range of issues it deals
 
02:19:03.750 --> 02:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
it gets enough there's lots of citizens
 
02:19:05.030 --> 02:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
that are
 
02:19:07.110 --> 02:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
maybe unhappy the things you do do you
 
02:19:08.230 --> 02:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
have a large
 
02:19:11.190 --> 02:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
number disputes where
 
02:19:11.200 --> 02:19:12.629 align:start position:0%
number disputes where
individuals

02:19:12.629 --> 02:19:12.639 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
02:19:12.639 --> 02:19:13.669 align:start position:0%
individuals
or

02:19:13.669 --> 02:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:19:16.230 --> 02:19:16.240 align:start position:0%
corporations want to sue
 
02:19:18.469 --> 02:19:18.479 align:start position:0%
hhs but are now prevented to do so
 
02:19:21.110 --> 02:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
because of the qualified immunity clause
 
02:19:23.110 --> 02:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
i know that's kind of hard hard to know
 
02:19:26.150 --> 02:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
but you you need give ideas that like a
 
02:19:27.910 --> 02:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
large number of cases or just a small
 
02:19:29.270 --> 02:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
number of cases
 
02:19:29.280 --> 02:19:31.830 align:start position:0%
number of cases
thanks

02:19:31.830 --> 02:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:33.429 --> 02:19:33.439 align:start position:0%
and mr chairman responding to
 
02:19:35.509 --> 02:19:35.519 align:start position:0%
representative horgan's uh you know
 
02:19:38.709 --> 02:19:38.719 align:start position:0%
question i first want to reflect that a
 
02:19:40.790 --> 02:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
large sizable portion of our population
 
02:19:42.549 --> 02:19:42.559 align:start position:0%
are very happy with the services that we
 
02:19:44.389 --> 02:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
are providing to them to protect our
 
02:19:47.910 --> 02:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
citizens and to provide the necessary um
 
02:19:49.990 --> 02:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
resources to make them independent and
 
02:19:51.830 --> 02:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
to really focus on their well-being so i
 
02:19:53.110 --> 02:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
would take a little bit of a different
 
02:19:54.389 --> 02:19:54.399 align:start position:0%
event on
 
02:19:56.550 --> 02:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
that part of your ear question uh the
 
02:19:59.110 --> 02:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
second part of it is i can certainly uh
 
02:20:01.750 --> 02:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
working along with our legal counsel as
 
02:20:03.270 --> 02:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
well as the department of justice kind
 
02:20:05.670 --> 02:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
of generate uh an idea of what we have
 
02:20:07.990 --> 02:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of litigation you probably may
 
02:20:10.630 --> 02:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
have been aware uh within the last week
 
02:20:13.190 --> 02:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
that um the division three at house
 
02:20:15.830 --> 02:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
finance through the leadership of the
 
02:20:17.590 --> 02:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
current chair of division 3
 
02:20:19.429 --> 02:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
representative jess edwards actually had
 
02:20:21.670 --> 02:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
the department of justice present on
 
02:20:23.429 --> 02:20:23.439 align:start position:0%
litigation issues they certainly could
 
02:20:25.030 --> 02:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
not talk about current or pending
 
02:20:27.270 --> 02:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
litigation issues for obvious reasons
 
02:20:28.550 --> 02:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
but they're able to come in with
 
02:20:30.150 --> 02:20:30.160 align:start position:0%
examples from the past from various
 
02:20:32.309 --> 02:20:32.319 align:start position:0%
state agencies uh in addition to the
 
02:20:33.990 --> 02:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
department of open services believe it
 
02:20:35.910 --> 02:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
or not there are litigation involving
 
02:20:37.910 --> 02:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
many other state agencies out there as
 
02:20:40.630 --> 02:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
well and and perhaps that kind of
 
02:20:41.990 --> 02:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
information would be helpful to this
 
02:20:44.710 --> 02:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
committee but i'm not prepared today to
 
02:20:47.030 --> 02:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
walk you through that
 
02:20:50.070 --> 02:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:52.309 --> 02:20:52.319 align:start position:0%
if i could just follow up on that though
 
02:20:55.190 --> 02:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
i'm just thinking in terms of my past
 
02:20:57.510 --> 02:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
experiences and you have
 
02:21:00.550 --> 02:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
cpsw's social workers
 
02:21:01.910 --> 02:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
who are out there having to make
 
02:21:04.150 --> 02:21:04.160 align:start position:0%
decisions with regard to moving
 
02:21:04.160 --> 02:21:05.990 align:start position:0%
decisions with regard to moving
removing

02:21:05.990 --> 02:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
removing
 
02:21:08.389 --> 02:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
children from homes
 
02:21:10.389 --> 02:21:10.399 align:start position:0%
separating them from their parents at
 
02:21:12.710 --> 02:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
times republicans
 
02:21:15.110 --> 02:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
aren't you concerned with regard to this
 
02:21:17.750 --> 02:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
legislation that it would have
 
02:21:20.070 --> 02:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
a cost or you would bear the department
 
02:21:22.309 --> 02:21:22.319 align:start position:0%
for the state and bear a cost as with
 
02:21:27.030 --> 02:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:29.429 --> 02:21:29.439 align:start position:0%
and reps and boarder we we do and that's
 
02:21:31.190 --> 02:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
why we respectfully came before the
 
02:21:34.150 --> 02:21:34.160 align:start position:0%
committee uh making the request at your
 
02:21:37.590 --> 02:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
election to uh utilize the existing
 
02:21:39.670 --> 02:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
authority that you have to
 
02:21:41.190 --> 02:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
directing the legislative budget
 
02:21:42.950 --> 02:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
assistance office to provide you that
 
02:21:47.910 --> 02:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:51.030 --> 02:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
any other questions for
 
02:21:52.630 --> 02:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
williams or ms

02:22:00.150 --> 02:22:00.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony today
 
02:22:02.389 --> 02:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
and thank you both very much
 
02:22:06.150 --> 02:22:06.160 align:start position:0%
i thank you all very much thank you
 
02:22:13.270 --> 02:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:15.590 --> 02:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman cordell johnson
 
02:22:17.349 --> 02:22:17.359 align:start position:0%
representing the new hampshire municipal
 
02:22:18.950 --> 02:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
association in
 
02:22:22.230 --> 02:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
a very strong opposition to this bill i
 
02:22:23.830 --> 02:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
will follow this with
 
02:22:25.830 --> 02:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh written testimony because there are
 
02:22:28.389 --> 02:22:28.399 align:start position:0%
some pretty complicated issues here
 
02:22:28.399 --> 02:22:29.110 align:start position:0%
some pretty complicated issues here
but

02:22:29.110 --> 02:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:22:31.750 --> 02:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
the discussion so far has been about
 
02:22:34.150 --> 02:22:34.160 align:start position:0%
so-called qualified immunity but this
 
02:22:36.870 --> 02:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
bill does not just eliminate qualified
 
02:22:39.670 --> 02:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
immunity it appears to eliminate every
 
02:22:42.070 --> 02:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
kind of immunity that is available to
 
02:22:44.790 --> 02:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
the state and political subdivisions
 
02:22:44.800 --> 02:22:46.309 align:start position:0%
the state and political subdivisions
um

02:22:46.309 --> 02:22:46.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:47.910 --> 02:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
and there are there are several
 
02:22:49.349 --> 02:22:49.359 align:start position:0%
different kinds of immunity i'm not
 
02:22:51.110 --> 02:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
going to not going to talk about them
 
02:22:55.270 --> 02:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
here i will in my letter but the idea of
 
02:22:57.990 --> 02:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
municipal immunity
 
02:22:59.510 --> 02:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:23:00.870 --> 02:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
the decisions
 
02:23:03.110 --> 02:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh the discretionary decisions that all
 
02:23:04.710 --> 02:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
kinds of
 
02:23:06.870 --> 02:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
officials and employees have to make
 
02:23:09.270 --> 02:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
every day
 
02:23:12.630 --> 02:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
if if all of those decisions are subject
 
02:23:14.950 --> 02:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
to lawsuit if something goes wrong
 
02:23:16.870 --> 02:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
eventually local government becomes
 
02:23:21.750 --> 02:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
impossible um and as um
 
02:23:23.510 --> 02:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
lieutenant morrison said this is not
 
02:23:25.910 --> 02:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
just it's not just police officers
 
02:23:28.630 --> 02:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
it's uh road agents it's building
 
02:23:32.550 --> 02:23:32.560 align:start position:0%
inspectors it's all kinds of
 
02:23:35.349 --> 02:23:35.359 align:start position:0%
municipal municipal employees
 
02:23:39.349 --> 02:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
if a if a building's building inspector
 
02:23:41.830 --> 02:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
issues a certificate of occupancy
 
02:23:45.270 --> 02:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
and does so in a reasonable manner
 
02:23:47.510 --> 02:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
currently that
 
02:23:49.830 --> 02:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
there is immunity for
 
02:23:52.309 --> 02:23:52.319 align:start position:0%
injuries uh resulting from that if the
 
02:23:53.670 --> 02:23:53.680 align:start position:0%
road agent
 
02:23:56.230 --> 02:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
makes a decision about whether and how a
 
02:23:59.110 --> 02:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
road should be repaired there is some
 
02:24:01.349 --> 02:24:01.359 align:start position:0%
level of immunity for that
 
02:24:04.630 --> 02:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
all of that immunity would be wiped away
 
02:24:07.030 --> 02:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
uh by this legislation
 
02:24:09.750 --> 02:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
um i want to correct something that uh i
 
02:24:11.510 --> 02:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
think it was the representative from
 
02:24:14.630 --> 02:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
americans for prosperity said he said
 
02:24:17.270 --> 02:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
that this bill does not allow a suit
 
02:24:19.510 --> 02:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
against the individual employee
 
02:24:21.990 --> 02:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
um it very clearly does it expressly
 
02:24:23.510 --> 02:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
says that the
 
02:24:23.520 --> 02:24:24.230 align:start position:0%
says that the
the

02:24:24.230 --> 02:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:24:26.710 --> 02:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
agent the employee will be named in the
 
02:24:26.720 --> 02:24:28.630 align:start position:0%
agent the employee will be named in the
lawsuit

02:24:28.630 --> 02:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
lawsuit
 
02:24:30.550 --> 02:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:24:34.550 --> 02:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity and its
 
02:24:37.190 --> 02:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
cousin official immunity
 
02:24:41.110 --> 02:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
provide immunity only when the actor the
 
02:24:41.120 --> 02:24:42.950 align:start position:0%
provide immunity only when the actor the
employee

02:24:42.950 --> 02:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
employee
 
02:24:45.510 --> 02:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
is acting in good faith and reasonably
 
02:24:47.910 --> 02:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
believes that his or her conduct is
 
02:24:47.920 --> 02:24:50.790 align:start position:0%
believes that his or her conduct is
lawful

02:24:50.790 --> 02:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:53.270 --> 02:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
under this bill the fact that the
 
02:24:55.190 --> 02:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
employee believed that his or her
 
02:24:56.950 --> 02:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
conduct was lawful
 
02:24:59.670 --> 02:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
would be irrelevant that that could not
 
02:25:02.230 --> 02:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
be asserted as an immunity or as a
 
02:25:02.240 --> 02:25:03.750 align:start position:0%
be asserted as an immunity or as a
defense

02:25:03.750 --> 02:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
defense
 
02:25:05.750 --> 02:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
and so just to use
 
02:25:08.150 --> 02:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
an example and this is very close to an
 
02:25:10.389 --> 02:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
actual case that occurred a few years
 
02:25:10.399 --> 02:25:13.270 align:start position:0%
actual case that occurred a few years
ago

02:25:13.270 --> 02:25:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:15.830 --> 02:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
a police officer arrests someone for
 
02:25:18.070 --> 02:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
violating a statute
 
02:25:19.910 --> 02:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
the officer does everything exactly
 
02:25:19.920 --> 02:25:20.710 align:start position:0%
the officer does everything exactly
right

02:25:20.710 --> 02:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:25:22.550 --> 02:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
and the person the person clearly
 
02:25:25.110 --> 02:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
violated the law
 
02:25:27.190 --> 02:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
he gets arrested but the supreme court
 
02:25:29.710 --> 02:25:29.720 align:start position:0%
subsequently declares that statute
 
02:25:32.389 --> 02:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional because the statute
 
02:25:34.389 --> 02:25:34.399 align:start position:0%
violates the
 
02:25:36.389 --> 02:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
person's first amendment or second or
 
02:25:39.510 --> 02:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
fourth amendment rights or whatever
 
02:25:42.630 --> 02:25:42.640 align:start position:0%
so now the person who was arrested
 
02:25:45.750 --> 02:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
under this bill can sue the officer for
 
02:25:48.309 --> 02:25:48.319 align:start position:0%
violating his constitutional rights
 
02:25:50.950 --> 02:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
even though the officer had no reason
 
02:25:54.630 --> 02:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
whatsoever to think that uh
 
02:25:57.750 --> 02:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
that he was doing anything unlawful
 
02:26:00.230 --> 02:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
under this bill
 
02:26:03.190 --> 02:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
that lawsuit is likely to be successful
 
02:26:03.200 --> 02:26:04.710 align:start position:0%
that lawsuit is likely to be successful
um

02:26:04.710 --> 02:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:06.550 --> 02:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
the person bringing the lawsuit gets
 
02:26:06.560 --> 02:26:07.670 align:start position:0%
the person bringing the lawsuit gets
damages

02:26:07.670 --> 02:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
damages
 
02:26:09.270 --> 02:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
whatever those may be
 
02:26:12.950 --> 02:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
and the town has to pay his uh attorney
 
02:26:12.960 --> 02:26:13.910 align:start position:0%
and the town has to pay his uh attorney
fees

02:26:13.910 --> 02:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
fees
 
02:26:16.150 --> 02:26:16.160 align:start position:0%
and his litigation costs
 
02:26:17.590 --> 02:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:26:19.670 --> 02:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
to top it all off under
 
02:26:22.790 --> 02:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
what would be the new section 7
 
02:26:26.150 --> 02:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
starting on line 21 on page 2
 
02:26:31.349 --> 02:26:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:33.670 --> 02:26:33.680 align:start position:0%
which seems to be
 
02:26:35.830 --> 02:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
an unconstitutional impairment of the
 
02:26:39.429 --> 02:26:39.439 align:start position:0%
obligation of contracts
 
02:26:39.439 --> 02:26:40.469 align:start position:0%
obligation of contracts
so

02:26:40.469 --> 02:26:40.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:26:44.150 --> 02:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:45.910 --> 02:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
i think people need to keep in mind that
 
02:26:48.710 --> 02:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
towns have no legal obligation to
 
02:26:50.870 --> 02:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
provide police protection
 
02:26:53.110 --> 02:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
they have no legal obligation to
 
02:26:55.590 --> 02:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
keep their roads open or pick up trash
 
02:26:58.150 --> 02:26:58.160 align:start position:0%
or provide recreational programs or many
 
02:26:59.750 --> 02:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
any of the other most of the other
 
02:27:02.070 --> 02:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
services that they provide
 
02:27:02.080 --> 02:27:03.510 align:start position:0%
services that they provide
um

02:27:03.510 --> 02:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:05.349 --> 02:27:05.359 align:start position:0%
and when they start
 
02:27:06.950 --> 02:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
being subject to
 
02:27:08.550 --> 02:27:08.560 align:start position:0%
lawsuits for
 
02:27:10.389 --> 02:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
the decisions that they make in good
 
02:27:13.750 --> 02:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
faith in providing all of those services
 
02:27:15.030 --> 02:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to start thinking about
 
02:27:16.950 --> 02:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
whether they want to continue to provide
 
02:27:19.110 --> 02:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
those services
 
02:27:22.389 --> 02:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:24.950 --> 02:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
if you could wrap up yep i have i have
 
02:27:26.710 --> 02:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
wrapped up
 
02:27:26.720 --> 02:27:28.870 align:start position:0%
wrapped up
okay

02:27:28.870 --> 02:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:27:33.990 --> 02:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:35.990 --> 02:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
yes representative alexander um thank
 
02:27:37.590 --> 02:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
you mr chair and thank you mr johnson
 
02:27:39.990 --> 02:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
for answering my question um i might be
 
02:27:42.830 --> 02:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
confused in reading this um which
 
02:27:46.389 --> 02:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
is common in some things um on line 22
 
02:27:48.309 --> 02:27:48.319 align:start position:0%
on page one it's our
 
02:27:50.070 --> 02:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
line 20 to 22 on page one it says an
 
02:27:51.750 --> 02:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
individual may seek legal equitable
 
02:27:54.070 --> 02:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
other relief on this chapter in the
 
02:27:55.830 --> 02:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
state court for an injury caused by an
 
02:27:57.670 --> 02:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
agent in the state of new hampshire but
 
02:27:59.349 --> 02:27:59.359 align:start position:0%
it says in violation of a right under
 
02:28:01.270 --> 02:28:01.280 align:start position:0%
laws for the constitution so you're
 
02:28:02.309 --> 02:28:02.319 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
02:28:05.429 --> 02:28:05.439 align:start position:0%
um if a if an individual like on the
 
02:28:07.990 --> 02:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
municipal level violated um a law that's
 
02:28:10.309 --> 02:28:10.319 align:start position:0%
in statute they would also qualify
 
02:28:12.070 --> 02:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
and it's constitutional and its
 
02:28:13.349 --> 02:28:13.359 align:start position:0%
constitutional right so it could be a
 
02:28:16.230 --> 02:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
law or policy um and a constitutional
 
02:28:18.550 --> 02:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
violation that would be subject to
 
02:28:20.870 --> 02:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
um litigation
 
02:28:23.190 --> 02:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
yes yeah by its terms this is this is
 
02:28:26.389 --> 02:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
not limited to constitutional violations
 
02:28:29.349 --> 02:28:29.359 align:start position:0%
okay follow up mr chair yes you may um
 
02:28:31.270 --> 02:28:31.280 align:start position:0%
if this was narrowed down like would
 
02:28:31.280 --> 02:28:32.070 align:start position:0%
if this was narrowed down like would
that

02:28:32.070 --> 02:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:28:34.550 --> 02:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
alleviate a lot of your concerns
 
02:28:37.190 --> 02:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
just to constitutional violations
 
02:28:39.910 --> 02:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
that would alleviate a small subset of
 
02:28:41.670 --> 02:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
my concerns
 
02:28:43.110 --> 02:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:28:44.630 --> 02:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
there'd still be a lot of concern in
 
02:28:44.640 --> 02:28:47.990 align:start position:0%
there'd still be a lot of concern in
there

02:28:47.990 --> 02:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:51.830 --> 02:28:51.840 align:start position:0%

great
 
02:29:20.950 --> 02:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
my name is patrick jacomo i'm an
 
02:29:23.510 --> 02:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
attorney at the non-profit institute for
 
02:29:25.830 --> 02:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
justice which is a law firm that offers
 
02:29:28.230 --> 02:29:28.240 align:start position:0%
all of our services to our clients pro
 
02:29:28.240 --> 02:29:29.510 align:start position:0%
all of our services to our clients pro
bono

02:29:29.510 --> 02:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
bono
 
02:29:31.270 --> 02:29:31.280 align:start position:0%
my colleagues and i at the institute for
 
02:29:31.280 --> 02:29:32.469 align:start position:0%
my colleagues and i at the institute for
justice

02:29:32.469 --> 02:29:32.479 align:start position:0%
justice
 
02:29:36.630 --> 02:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
support hb 111 for two important reasons
 
02:29:39.910 --> 02:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
first hb 111 restores the concept of
 
02:29:41.510 --> 02:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
constitutional accountability and
 
02:29:44.790 --> 02:29:44.800 align:start position:0%
ensures unlike under the current regime
 
02:29:46.469 --> 02:29:46.479 align:start position:0%
that where there is a constitutional
 
02:29:49.429 --> 02:29:49.439 align:start position:0%
right that right is actually enforceable
 
02:29:52.070 --> 02:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
and second hb 111
 
02:29:54.630 --> 02:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
does so in a way that will not open the
 
02:29:56.550 --> 02:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
floodgates of litigation it's very
 
02:29:58.790 --> 02:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
reasonable and it ensures that the
 
02:30:01.270 --> 02:30:01.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate accountability falls on the
 
02:30:03.270 --> 02:30:03.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate people and damages fall on
 
02:30:04.870 --> 02:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
the employers and not the individual
 
02:30:04.880 --> 02:30:06.630 align:start position:0%
the employers and not the individual
employees

02:30:06.630 --> 02:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
employees
 
02:30:08.550 --> 02:30:08.560 align:start position:0%
first i'd like to get into this issue of
 
02:30:11.830 --> 02:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
accountability a little bit further
 
02:30:13.190 --> 02:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
under the us and new hampshire
 
02:30:16.230 --> 02:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
constitutions their entire purpose is to
 
02:30:17.910 --> 02:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
limit the government and the things that
 
02:30:19.590 --> 02:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
its agents can do
 
02:30:21.190 --> 02:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
and in large part that includes
 
02:30:23.990 --> 02:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
infringing on individual rights
 
02:30:25.990 --> 02:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
under doctrines created by the supreme
 
02:30:28.389 --> 02:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
court like qualified immunity government
 
02:30:31.110 --> 02:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
workers are allowed effectively allowed
 
02:30:33.590 --> 02:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
to violate the constitution without any
 
02:30:35.910 --> 02:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
recourse for the person whose rights
 
02:30:37.429 --> 02:30:37.439 align:start position:0%
have been violated
 
02:30:39.750 --> 02:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
now representative burch and mr bisonnet
 
02:30:41.270 --> 02:30:41.280 align:start position:0%
have done a great job explaining
 
02:30:43.270 --> 02:30:43.280 align:start position:0%
qualified immunities so i won't give the
 
02:30:44.790 --> 02:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
big picture here but i think it would be
 
02:30:47.349 --> 02:30:47.359 align:start position:0%
helpful to frame my explanation of how
 
02:30:49.030 --> 02:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity works in response to
 
02:30:50.550 --> 02:30:50.560 align:start position:0%
some things that were said by lieutenant
 
02:30:52.870 --> 02:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
morrison and mr johnson
 
02:30:54.389 --> 02:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
first i'll point out that qualified
 
02:30:55.750 --> 02:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
immunity is
 
02:30:58.389 --> 02:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
is in effect by default so unless a
 
02:31:00.389 --> 02:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
plaintiff can show clearly established
 
02:31:00.399 --> 02:31:01.429 align:start position:0%
plaintiff can show clearly established
law

02:31:01.429 --> 02:31:01.439 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:31:03.429 --> 02:31:03.439 align:start position:0%
the government worker by default is
 
02:31:05.750 --> 02:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
immune from any constitutional or legal
 
02:31:08.469 --> 02:31:08.479 align:start position:0%
claims in civil court and here this is
 
02:31:11.190 --> 02:31:11.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely crucial when lieutenant
 
02:31:13.110 --> 02:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
lieutenant morrison and mr johnson say
 
02:31:15.349 --> 02:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
that qualified immunity only applies to
 
02:31:17.910 --> 02:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
actions taken in good faith or not
 
02:31:20.469 --> 02:31:20.479 align:start position:0%
reckless or not wanton actions that is
 
02:31:23.990 --> 02:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely incorrect since 1982 when the
 
02:31:25.670 --> 02:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
united states supreme court decided a
 
02:31:28.469 --> 02:31:28.479 align:start position:0%
case called harlow versus fitzgerald
 
02:31:30.150 --> 02:31:30.160 align:start position:0%
the standard for applying qualified
 
02:31:31.990 --> 02:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
immunity does not take into
 
02:31:33.670 --> 02:31:33.680 align:start position:0%
consideration good faith or
 
02:31:35.750 --> 02:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
reasonableness all it asks is whether
 
02:31:37.349 --> 02:31:37.359 align:start position:0%
there was an earlier court case that
 
02:31:38.950 --> 02:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
said exactly what happened was
 
02:31:40.469 --> 02:31:40.479 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and to give you two
 
02:31:42.309 --> 02:31:42.319 align:start position:0%
examples where recklessness and
 
02:31:44.790 --> 02:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
wantonness were recently allowed there's
 
02:31:46.230 --> 02:31:46.240 align:start position:0%
a case from the ninth circuit called
 
02:31:48.630 --> 02:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
jessa versus city of fresno where police
 
02:31:50.630 --> 02:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
officers were alleged to have stolen two
 
02:31:53.030 --> 02:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars and the ninth
 
02:31:55.429 --> 02:31:55.439 align:start position:0%
circuit actually held although every
 
02:31:56.950 --> 02:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
society throughout history knows
 
02:31:59.190 --> 02:31:59.200 align:start position:0%
stealing is wrong because there's not an
 
02:32:00.550 --> 02:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
earlier court case saying it's
 
02:32:02.630 --> 02:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional these officers are
 
02:32:04.630 --> 02:32:04.640 align:start position:0%
entitled to qualified immunity now on
 
02:32:06.309 --> 02:32:06.319 align:start position:0%
the issue of recklessness there was
 
02:32:08.150 --> 02:32:08.160 align:start position:0%
recently an 11th circuit case called
 
02:32:10.389 --> 02:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
corbett versus vickers and in that case
 
02:32:12.389 --> 02:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
a police officer while trying to shoot a
 
02:32:14.550 --> 02:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
non-threatening family dog
 
02:32:17.030 --> 02:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
shot a 10 year old instead and the 11th
 
02:32:19.349 --> 02:32:19.359 align:start position:0%
circuit said that officer gets qualified
 
02:32:20.790 --> 02:32:20.800 align:start position:0%
immunity it doesn't matter if their
 
02:32:23.190 --> 02:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
actions were reckless so the concept of
 
02:32:25.030 --> 02:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
good faith immunity does not exist in
 
02:32:28.550 --> 02:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
american law and hasn't since 1982.
 
02:32:30.150 --> 02:32:30.160 align:start position:0%
another thing that frequently comes up
 
02:32:32.309 --> 02:32:32.319 align:start position:0%
in this context is that police officers
 
02:32:34.150 --> 02:32:34.160 align:start position:0%
in particular have to confront
 
02:32:36.230 --> 02:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
split-second decisions that they need to
 
02:32:37.990 --> 02:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
make without fear of any sort of
 
02:32:40.550 --> 02:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
liability now we don't disagree with
 
02:32:43.270 --> 02:32:43.280 align:start position:0%
that we simply point out that qualified
 
02:32:45.270 --> 02:32:45.280 align:start position:0%
immunity is not the mechanism to ensure
 
02:32:46.550 --> 02:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
that police
 
02:32:48.469 --> 02:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
aren't held account aren't held to
 
02:32:51.030 --> 02:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
account for reasonable mistakes only
 
02:32:52.389 --> 02:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
unreasonable mistakes
 
02:32:54.630 --> 02:32:54.640 align:start position:0%
now earlier lieutenant morrison said
 
02:32:56.870 --> 02:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
anytime the police search or sees
 
02:32:59.270 --> 02:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
anything that's unconstitutional on that
 
02:33:01.270 --> 02:33:01.280 align:start position:0%
point mr morrison is just simply wrong
 
02:33:03.270 --> 02:33:03.280 align:start position:0%
on how the constitution operates the
 
02:33:05.590 --> 02:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
constitution only limits unreasonable
 
02:33:07.429 --> 02:33:07.439 align:start position:0%
searches and seizures and that standard
 
02:33:09.190 --> 02:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
takes into account split-second
 
02:33:10.790 --> 02:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
decisions that need to be made in all of
 
02:33:13.750 --> 02:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
the circumstances that surround those
 
02:33:16.469 --> 02:33:16.479 align:start position:0%
so reasonableness mr jack
 
02:33:18.870 --> 02:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
jacomo if you could wrap up that would
 
02:33:21.990 --> 02:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
be great sure just in some this this
 
02:33:24.790 --> 02:33:24.800 align:start position:0%
bill will add accountability without uh
 
02:33:26.710 --> 02:33:26.720 align:start position:0%
without flooding courts with lawsuits
 
02:33:28.389 --> 02:33:28.399 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to answer any questions
 
02:33:30.790 --> 02:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
that the committee might have
 
02:33:34.630 --> 02:33:34.640 align:start position:0%
yeah either yes representative maclean
 
02:33:36.389 --> 02:33:36.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:33:38.389 --> 02:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
my question all right so i'm just trying
 
02:33:40.630 --> 02:33:40.640 align:start position:0%
to understand this since the harlow
 
02:33:43.190 --> 02:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
versus fitzgerald case
 
02:33:46.070 --> 02:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
um you have to show a violation of
 
02:33:48.710 --> 02:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
clearly established case law
 
02:33:52.389 --> 02:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
to overcome qualified immunity so
 
02:33:54.950 --> 02:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
if there is no established case law and
 
02:33:57.830 --> 02:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
you go into new situations
 
02:34:00.230 --> 02:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
do you have an opportunity to establish
 
02:34:01.910 --> 02:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
new case law i'm just having a real
 
02:34:01.920 --> 02:34:02.870 align:start position:0%
new case law i'm just having a real
struggle

02:34:02.870 --> 02:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
struggle
 
02:34:04.150 --> 02:34:04.160 align:start position:0%
with with
 
02:34:06.950 --> 02:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
is there an opportunity since 1982 to
 
02:34:09.429 --> 02:34:09.439 align:start position:0%
even establish new case law
 
02:34:12.070 --> 02:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
am i answering the question correctly
 
02:34:13.750 --> 02:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
so you're correct about the standard
 
02:34:15.190 --> 02:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
which is that all that matters is
 
02:34:17.030 --> 02:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
whether there's an earlier case the only
 
02:34:18.469 --> 02:34:18.479 align:start position:0%
wrinkle today
 
02:34:20.070 --> 02:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
is that courts effectively have
 
02:34:22.230 --> 02:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
discretion to decide a new
 
02:34:24.309 --> 02:34:24.319 align:start position:0%
constitutional issue but far more often
 
02:34:26.389 --> 02:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
what they do is exercise discretion not
 
02:34:28.870 --> 02:34:28.880 align:start position:0%
to decide it and instead simply say this
 
02:34:30.550 --> 02:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
case gets thrown out because there's not
 
02:34:32.870 --> 02:34:32.880 align:start position:0%
an earlier case and so for example in
 
02:34:34.790 --> 02:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
both the 9th circuit and 11th circuit
 
02:34:37.349 --> 02:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
cases i mentioned earlier the court
 
02:34:39.270 --> 02:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
declined to establish those were
 
02:34:41.270 --> 02:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
constitutional violations which means in
 
02:34:43.429 --> 02:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
the future police in california and
 
02:34:45.190 --> 02:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
washington state can steal knowing
 
02:34:47.030 --> 02:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
they're protected by qualified immunity
 
02:34:48.710 --> 02:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
and similar actions can be taken in the
 
02:34:50.710 --> 02:34:50.720 align:start position:0%
11th circuit
 
02:34:54.150 --> 02:34:54.160 align:start position:0%
so they have an opportunity to establish
 
02:34:56.870 --> 02:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
a new precedent but they usually choose
 
02:34:58.790 --> 02:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
not to they rarely choose exercises is
 
02:35:04.790 --> 02:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:04.800 --> 02:35:05.590 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:35:05.590 --> 02:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:35:08.870 --> 02:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative sylvia
 
02:35:12.070 --> 02:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you mr
 
02:35:15.590 --> 02:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
jacomo for taking my question a previous
 
02:35:19.270 --> 02:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh speaker talked about
 
02:35:22.070 --> 02:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
the possible violation of a
 
02:35:25.429 --> 02:35:25.439 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to contract if
 
02:35:28.950 --> 02:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
an employee was fired under this
 
02:35:30.469 --> 02:35:30.479 align:start position:0%
is that uh something you would agree
 
02:35:30.479 --> 02:35:31.590 align:start position:0%
is that uh something you would agree
with

02:35:31.590 --> 02:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:35:33.910 --> 02:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh rep representative sylvia i'm not
 
02:35:35.590 --> 02:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
exactly sure how that would apply in
 
02:35:37.349 --> 02:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
these contexts other than through things
 
02:35:39.670 --> 02:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
related to union collective bargaining
 
02:35:41.670 --> 02:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
but uh that could easily be solved
 
02:35:43.590 --> 02:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
simply by bargaining around that in the
 
02:35:45.750 --> 02:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
future to ensure that termination is a
 
02:35:48.070 --> 02:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
possibility if there's a violation of hp
 
02:35:48.080 --> 02:35:49.990 align:start position:0%
possibility if there's a violation of hp
111

02:35:49.990 --> 02:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
111
 
02:35:54.710 --> 02:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:58.469 --> 02:35:58.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:01.349 --> 02:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:05.270 --> 02:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:08.630 --> 02:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
for mr jacomo
 
02:36:10.710 --> 02:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
02:36:10.720 --> 02:36:11.830 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
today

02:36:11.830 --> 02:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:36:14.550 --> 02:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
there is one hand up among the attendees
 
02:36:16.469 --> 02:36:16.479 align:start position:0%
and that's uh
 
02:36:22.389 --> 02:36:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:25.190 --> 02:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair my name is lynn

marie kruzak the last name is spelled
 
02:36:27.120 --> 02:36:29.590 align:start position:0%
marie kruzak the last name is spelled
c-u-s-a-c-k

02:36:29.590 --> 02:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
c-u-s-a-c-k
 
02:36:31.990 --> 02:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
and i am the director of professional
 
02:36:33.030 --> 02:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
standards at the new hampshire
 
02:36:35.110 --> 02:36:35.120 align:start position:0%
department of corrections
 
02:36:36.870 --> 02:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
um we did not
 
02:36:40.070 --> 02:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
pre-register for this bill but i felt
 
02:36:42.070 --> 02:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
compelled in listening to the testimony
 
02:36:42.080 --> 02:36:43.030 align:start position:0%
compelled in listening to the testimony
today

02:36:43.030 --> 02:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:36:46.070 --> 02:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
to um speak out because i believe that
 
02:36:48.550 --> 02:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
the language of the bill as originally
 
02:36:50.870 --> 02:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
written is broader than what has been
 
02:36:53.429 --> 02:36:53.439 align:start position:0%
suggested by today's testimony we've
 
02:36:56.230 --> 02:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
heard much discussion about qualified
 
02:36:58.870 --> 02:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
immunity today and qualified immunity is
 
02:37:01.670 --> 02:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
different than sovereign immunity
 
02:37:03.990 --> 02:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
sovereign immunity is something that the
 
02:37:09.349 --> 02:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
legislature has already waived in 541 b
 
02:37:11.270 --> 02:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
and that statute
 
02:37:14.389 --> 02:37:14.399 align:start position:0%
does have exceptions for
 
02:37:17.590 --> 02:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
when a case
 
02:37:17.600 --> 02:37:20.389 align:start position:0%
when a case
can

02:37:20.389 --> 02:37:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:22.550 --> 02:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
where sovereign immunity is accepted out
 
02:37:24.870 --> 02:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
and and the legislature hasn't waived it
 
02:37:27.990 --> 02:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
saying that the state may still use that
 
02:37:30.389 --> 02:37:30.399 align:start position:0%
as a jurisdictional reason
 
02:37:32.790 --> 02:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
not to go forward with the case
 
02:37:34.710 --> 02:37:34.720 align:start position:0%
which is different than qualified
 
02:37:38.150 --> 02:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
immunity qualified immunity is a defense
 
02:37:39.590 --> 02:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
in a case
 
02:37:42.230 --> 02:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
and while i said that i am the director
 
02:37:44.150 --> 02:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
of professional standards at the
 
02:37:47.110 --> 02:37:47.120 align:start position:0%
department of corrections i have also
 
02:37:49.429 --> 02:37:49.439 align:start position:0%
spent approximately 15 years at the
 
02:37:51.270 --> 02:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
department of justice in new hampshire
 
02:37:54.870 --> 02:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office litigating
 
02:37:57.750 --> 02:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
all sorts of cases from the cases
 
02:38:00.309 --> 02:38:00.319 align:start position:0%
relative to
 
02:38:02.630 --> 02:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
our transportation department and
 
02:38:06.150 --> 02:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
slippery roads to our cases with
 
02:38:10.469 --> 02:38:10.479 align:start position:0%
dhhs and individuals being
 
02:38:12.710 --> 02:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
brought under scrutiny for the way that
 
02:38:17.030 --> 02:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
they handle cases with child protection
 
02:38:17.040 --> 02:38:18.550 align:start position:0%
they handle cases with child protection
or

02:38:18.550 --> 02:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:38:20.710 --> 02:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
my recent cases before leaving the
 
02:38:22.150 --> 02:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office for the
 
02:38:24.469 --> 02:38:24.479 align:start position:0%
department of corrections in litigation
 
02:38:26.389 --> 02:38:26.399 align:start position:0%
matters whether they are with
 
02:38:28.550 --> 02:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
corrections officers
 
02:38:28.560 --> 02:38:29.510 align:start position:0%
corrections officers
or

02:38:29.510 --> 02:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:38:31.429 --> 02:38:31.439 align:start position:0%
state police also
 
02:38:35.030 --> 02:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
so i have a breadth of experience in how
 
02:38:37.590 --> 02:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire operates with sovereign
 
02:38:39.349 --> 02:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
immunity and with
 
02:38:41.750 --> 02:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity so
 
02:38:41.760 --> 02:38:43.349 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity so
rsa

02:38:43.349 --> 02:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
rsa
 
02:38:45.590 --> 02:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
again 541b
 
02:38:48.469 --> 02:38:48.479 align:start position:0%
19 would essentially be
 
02:38:51.429 --> 02:38:51.439 align:start position:0%
nullified done away with by the language
 
02:38:53.830 --> 02:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
of this statute
 
02:38:53.840 --> 02:38:55.510 align:start position:0%
of this statute
also

02:38:55.510 --> 02:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:38:56.710 --> 02:38:56.720 align:start position:0%
one of the things that attorney
 
02:39:00.070 --> 02:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
bissonnette indicated is that their what
 
02:39:03.349 --> 02:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
the statute was doing or what hb 111
 
02:39:06.790 --> 02:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
does is allow for responding at superior
 
02:39:08.469 --> 02:39:08.479 align:start position:0%
to exist
 
02:39:10.230 --> 02:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
that already exists in the state of new
 
02:39:13.990 --> 02:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire under 541b9a
 
02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:14.950 align:start position:0%
hampshire under 541b9a
which

02:39:14.950 --> 02:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:39:14.960 --> 02:39:16.150 align:start position:0%
which
allows

02:39:16.150 --> 02:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
allows
 
02:39:16.160 --> 02:39:17.030 align:start position:0%
allows
the

02:39:17.030 --> 02:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:39:19.270 --> 02:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
court to make a determination
 
02:39:21.590 --> 02:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
that the state will be responsible for
 
02:39:23.670 --> 02:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
the actions of its agent employee or
 
02:39:23.680 --> 02:39:24.790 align:start position:0%
the actions of its agent employee or
official

02:39:24.790 --> 02:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
official
 
02:39:27.830 --> 02:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
when those actions
 
02:39:27.840 --> 02:39:29.510 align:start position:0%
when those actions
are

02:39:29.510 --> 02:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:39:31.590 --> 02:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
also when they're brought against the
 
02:39:33.990 --> 02:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
state excuse me that individual the
 
02:39:36.389 --> 02:39:36.399 align:start position:0%
state will step in and defend and
 
02:39:38.550 --> 02:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
indemnify that individual
 
02:39:40.630 --> 02:39:40.640 align:start position:0%
under another statute in the state which
 
02:39:42.790 --> 02:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
is rsa 99d
 
02:39:45.510 --> 02:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
so all of these statutes already exist
 
02:39:46.790 --> 02:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
02:39:50.870 --> 02:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
but the language as written
 
02:39:54.870 --> 02:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
in house bill 111 is much broader than
 
02:39:54.880 --> 02:39:55.750 align:start position:0%
in house bill 111 is much broader than
just

02:39:55.750 --> 02:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:39:58.070 --> 02:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
dealing with qualified immunity i would
 
02:40:00.870 --> 02:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
suggest that if um you could just wrap
 
02:40:02.150 --> 02:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
up your testimony that would be
 
02:40:05.030 --> 02:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
appreciated certainly my my my last
 
02:40:06.950 --> 02:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
suggestion was going to be that the
 
02:40:10.150 --> 02:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
committee do um to look at this in a
 
02:40:13.030 --> 02:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
study committee and um maybe there's
 
02:40:16.150 --> 02:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
language that can be adopted by all of
 
02:40:19.110 --> 02:40:19.120 align:start position:0%
the individuals that are stakeholders so
 
02:40:21.590 --> 02:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
that some language can be presented back
 
02:40:22.870 --> 02:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
to the
 
02:40:24.630 --> 02:40:24.640 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
02:40:26.790 --> 02:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
 
02:40:31.990 --> 02:40:32.000 align:start position:0%

seeing none again thank you for your
 
02:40:35.349 --> 02:40:35.359 align:start position:0%

other hands up among the attendees
 
02:40:46.469 --> 02:40:46.479 align:start position:0%
that being the case i will
 
02:40:48.630 --> 02:40:48.640 align:start position:0%
declare the hearing closed on house bill
 
02:40:48.640 --> 02:40:50.389 align:start position:0%
declare the hearing closed on house bill

02:40:52.630 --> 02:40:52.640 align:start position:0%
and the committee will be in
 
02:40:53.910 --> 02:40:53.920 align:start position:0%

almost a year i find that i talk to

myself a lot and apparently i had
 
02:41:11.590 --> 02:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
neglected to mute myself at one point
 
02:41:13.670 --> 02:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
and was therefore
 
02:41:16.710 --> 02:41:16.720 align:start position:0%
heard talking to myself and i want to
 
02:41:19.910 --> 02:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
apologize for that i'll try my best not
 
02:41:27.429 --> 02:41:27.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:28.830 --> 02:41:28.840 align:start position:0%

okay

03:55:14.229 --> 03:55:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:14.239 --> 03:55:35.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:55:35.030 --> 03:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:49.030 --> 03:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:59.670 --> 03:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:01.429 --> 03:56:01.439 align:start position:0%
and the emails from coming in all
 
03:56:02.469 --> 03:56:02.479 align:start position:0%
through the
 
03:56:02.479 --> 03:56:24.150 align:start position:0%
through the
okay

03:56:24.150 --> 03:56:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:26.550 --> 03:56:26.560 align:start position:0%

doing any executing on friday
 
03:56:29.680 --> 03:56:31.590 align:start position:0%
doing any executing on friday
no

03:56:31.590 --> 03:56:31.600 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:56:31.600 --> 03:56:33.189 align:start position:0%
no
the

03:56:33.189 --> 03:56:33.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:56:36.870 --> 03:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
my plan is to hear our bills on friday
 
03:56:39.110 --> 03:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
and then what i'd like to do is on
 
03:56:42.070 --> 03:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
tuesday when we meet make that full day
 
03:56:43.590 --> 03:56:43.600 align:start position:0%
and exec session
 
03:56:45.750 --> 03:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
at that point in time we'll have 31
 
03:56:45.760 --> 03:56:48.229 align:start position:0%
at that point in time we'll have 31
bills

03:56:48.229 --> 03:56:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:50.870 --> 03:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
and to exec
 
03:56:50.880 --> 03:56:52.790 align:start position:0%
and to exec
and

03:56:52.790 --> 03:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:56:55.750 --> 03:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
and so i figured that we would make a
 
03:56:57.349 --> 03:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
day of after
 
03:56:58.950 --> 03:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
after that
 
03:56:58.960 --> 03:56:59.990 align:start position:0%
after that
um

03:56:59.990 --> 03:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:02.070 --> 03:57:02.080 align:start position:0%
well i've i know i've been given that
 
03:57:05.910 --> 03:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
following friday again uh for a full day
 
03:57:08.389 --> 03:57:08.399 align:start position:0%
we have seven bills to here
 
03:57:11.510 --> 03:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm told we might get an eighth bill
 
03:57:13.750 --> 03:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
after this house session there's
 
03:57:15.750 --> 03:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
apparently another
 
03:57:18.150 --> 03:57:18.160 align:start position:0%
uh pfass bill that
 
03:57:20.150 --> 03:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
is sort of complementary to the bills we
 
03:57:21.750 --> 03:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
have and they're talking about sending
 
03:57:23.670 --> 03:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
that to us as well
 
03:57:23.680 --> 03:57:25.269 align:start position:0%
that to us as well
and

03:57:25.269 --> 03:57:25.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:57:27.349 --> 03:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
uh so we may have eight bills but we'll
 
03:57:30.389 --> 03:57:30.399 align:start position:0%
have seven bills at that point in time
 
03:57:30.399 --> 03:57:31.189 align:start position:0%
have seven bills at that point in time
so

03:57:31.189 --> 03:57:31.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:57:32.830 --> 03:57:32.840 align:start position:0%
long and short as
 
03:57:37.189 --> 03:57:37.199 align:start position:0%
i uh hope to exec on tuesday next
 
03:57:39.750 --> 03:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
tuesday as much as the second
 
03:57:43.670 --> 03:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
yes as much as we possibly can get done
 
03:57:45.030 --> 03:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
and okay
 
03:57:45.990 --> 03:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:57:48.710 --> 03:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
well here we'll have that friday excuse
 
03:57:48.720 --> 03:57:49.750 align:start position:0%
well here we'll have that friday excuse
me

03:57:49.750 --> 03:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
me
 
03:57:51.990 --> 03:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
we'll hear the uh
 
03:57:53.830 --> 03:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
remaining bills
 
03:57:56.150 --> 03:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
and then i'm hoping that we will have
 
03:57:59.590 --> 03:57:59.600 align:start position:0%
one another full day of executing uh to
 
03:58:05.110 --> 03:58:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:06.309 --> 03:58:06.319 align:start position:0%
and i've asked
 
03:58:08.309 --> 03:58:08.319 align:start position:0%
asked to have
 
03:58:10.469 --> 03:58:10.479 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we've been meeting on
 
03:58:13.030 --> 03:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
tuesdays tuesday the 9th happens to be
 
03:58:14.550 --> 03:58:14.560 align:start position:0%
town meeting day
 
03:58:16.630 --> 03:58:16.640 align:start position:0%
and we don't ordinarily hold hearings on
 
03:58:19.189 --> 03:58:19.199 align:start position:0%
town meeting day
 
03:58:20.870 --> 03:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
not to mention the fact on the town
 
03:58:22.710 --> 03:58:22.720 align:start position:0%
moderator but
 
03:58:22.720 --> 03:58:26.389 align:start position:0%
moderator but
um

03:58:26.389 --> 03:58:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:26.399 --> 03:58:27.110 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:58:27.110 --> 03:58:27.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:58:29.990 --> 03:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
long and the short is i've asked that if
 
03:58:31.910 --> 03:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
we have a day a full day at the
 
03:58:34.070 --> 03:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
beginning of that week either the 8th or
 
03:58:35.349 --> 03:58:35.359 align:start position:0%
the 10th
 
03:58:38.790 --> 03:58:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:43.590 --> 03:58:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:45.830 --> 03:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
that ok make sense to you
 
03:58:48.790 --> 03:58:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:50.550 --> 03:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
pretty much everything you say makes
 
03:58:52.710 --> 03:58:52.720 align:start position:0%
sense to me
 
03:58:53.990 --> 03:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
not 100
 
03:58:54.000 --> 03:58:54.870 align:start position:0%
not 100
but

03:58:54.870 --> 03:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:59:24.830 --> 03:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:24.840 --> 03:59:38.830 align:start position:0%
 
channel

03:59:38.830 --> 03:59:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:42.070 --> 03:59:42.080 align:start position:0%
nice well it'd be one o'clock i'll call
 
03:59:44.790 --> 03:59:44.800 align:start position:0%

alternative drug offender grant programs
 
03:59:59.349 --> 03:59:59.359 align:start position:0%
the primary sponsor of that bill was
 
04:00:01.429 --> 04:00:01.439 align:start position:0%
representative james colleen
 
04:00:03.830 --> 04:00:03.840 align:start position:0%

hb 212
 
04:00:26.790 --> 04:00:26.800 align:start position:0%
this was a bill um
 
04:00:29.510 --> 04:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
that was crafted out of concern of a
 
04:00:31.429 --> 04:00:31.439 align:start position:0%
constituent of mine
 
04:00:31.439 --> 04:00:32.710 align:start position:0%
constituent of mine
whose

04:00:32.710 --> 04:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
whose
 
04:00:34.790 --> 04:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
son-in-law has gone through the drug
 
04:00:37.510 --> 04:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
court program and had a difficult time
 
04:00:38.870 --> 04:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
with it
 
04:00:41.189 --> 04:00:41.199 align:start position:0%
i will tell you that i did
 
04:00:43.590 --> 04:00:43.600 align:start position:0%
speak with the honorable
 
04:00:43.600 --> 04:00:45.110 align:start position:0%
speak with the honorable
nato

04:00:45.110 --> 04:00:45.120 align:start position:0%
nato
 
04:00:47.750 --> 04:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
about her drug court program with this
 
04:00:49.269 --> 04:00:49.279 align:start position:0%
we had a long discussion before i
 
04:00:52.710 --> 04:00:52.720 align:start position:0%
decided to go ahead with filing it
 
04:00:52.720 --> 04:00:53.590 align:start position:0%
decided to go ahead with filing it
and

04:00:53.590 --> 04:00:53.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:00:57.750 --> 04:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:59.750 --> 04:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this bill
 
04:01:02.830 --> 04:01:02.840 align:start position:0%
is to address one of the situations
 
04:01:02.840 --> 04:01:04.469 align:start position:0%
is to address one of the situations
that

04:01:04.469 --> 04:01:04.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:01:07.269 --> 04:01:07.279 align:start position:0%
my constituent found when
 
04:01:09.349 --> 04:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
her son-in-law was trying to find his
 
04:01:10.790 --> 04:01:10.800 align:start position:0%
feet again
 
04:01:12.309 --> 04:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
after going through the drug court
 
04:01:12.319 --> 04:01:13.750 align:start position:0%
after going through the drug court
program

04:01:13.750 --> 04:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:01:16.950 --> 04:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
and it is an enabling bill it allows the
 
04:01:20.309 --> 04:01:20.319 align:start position:0%
judge at their discretion
 
04:01:24.550 --> 04:01:24.560 align:start position:0%
to order that a social worker also visit
 
04:01:25.990 --> 04:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
the person who's in the drug court
 
04:01:27.990 --> 04:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
program in addition to the parole
 
04:01:28.000 --> 04:01:29.429 align:start position:0%
program in addition to the parole
officer

04:01:29.429 --> 04:01:29.439 align:start position:0%
officer
 
04:01:31.030 --> 04:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
because currently
 
04:01:32.870 --> 04:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
although that's something they like to
 
04:01:34.950 --> 04:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
do from time to time it's not
 
04:01:36.309 --> 04:01:36.319 align:start position:0%
it's not something that gets ordered
 
04:01:38.870 --> 04:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
along with with everything else
 
04:01:38.880 --> 04:01:39.910 align:start position:0%
along with with everything else
and

04:01:39.910 --> 04:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:01:41.510 --> 04:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
my constituent
 
04:01:44.150 --> 04:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
related to me that
 
04:01:47.110 --> 04:01:47.120 align:start position:0%
her son-in-law did not have a lot of
 
04:01:49.510 --> 04:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
skills and he had grew up
 
04:01:51.510 --> 04:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
selling drugs
 
04:01:51.520 --> 04:01:52.630 align:start position:0%
selling drugs
and

04:01:52.630 --> 04:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:01:54.309 --> 04:01:54.319 align:start position:0%
was finding it very difficult and
 
04:01:57.830 --> 04:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
emotionally troubling and and had a lot
 
04:01:59.590 --> 04:01:59.600 align:start position:0%
of serious
 
04:02:02.229 --> 04:02:02.239 align:start position:0%
emotional problems while trying to get
 
04:02:04.150 --> 04:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
back into society after completing the
 
04:02:06.469 --> 04:02:06.479 align:start position:0%
drug drug court program
 
04:02:06.479 --> 04:02:08.550 align:start position:0%
drug drug court program
and

04:02:08.550 --> 04:02:08.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:02:11.830 --> 04:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
the parole officer who would visit was
 
04:02:14.790 --> 04:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
primarily concerned with was he doing
 
04:02:16.870 --> 04:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
drugs was he
 
04:02:19.110 --> 04:02:19.120 align:start position:0%
dealing drugs was he breaking the law or
 
04:02:21.990 --> 04:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
any of the guidelines of his parole
 
04:02:24.070 --> 04:02:24.080 align:start position:0%
and not really looking into whether that
 
04:02:24.080 --> 04:02:25.910 align:start position:0%
and not really looking into whether that
person

04:02:25.910 --> 04:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
person
 
04:02:25.920 --> 04:02:27.510 align:start position:0%
person
was

04:02:27.510 --> 04:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:02:29.910 --> 04:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
emotionally okay
 
04:02:32.870 --> 04:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:34.870 --> 04:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
able to
 
04:02:37.110 --> 04:02:37.120 align:start position:0%
have the strength to search for work and
 
04:02:38.229 --> 04:02:38.239 align:start position:0%
find other
 
04:02:40.389 --> 04:02:40.399 align:start position:0%
other alternatives
 
04:02:42.229 --> 04:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
this bill does play into the next bill
 
04:02:44.950 --> 04:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
i'll present be presenting at 1 30 uh
 
04:02:46.389 --> 04:02:46.399 align:start position:0%
for you but i wanted to keep them
 
04:02:48.550 --> 04:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
separate in case the committee had an
 
04:02:50.710 --> 04:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
opinion different on one bill than the
 
04:02:50.720 --> 04:02:53.030 align:start position:0%
opinion different on one bill than the
other

04:02:53.030 --> 04:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:55.429 --> 04:02:55.439 align:start position:0%
and and so that is where this bill comes
 
04:02:57.990 --> 04:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
out of it allows the judge to order that
 
04:03:00.229 --> 04:03:00.239 align:start position:0%
a social worker
 
04:03:02.550 --> 04:03:02.560 align:start position:0%
be at one time or
 
04:03:06.710 --> 04:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
multiple times visit and check up on the
 
04:03:09.189 --> 04:03:09.199 align:start position:0%

04:03:11.189 --> 04:03:11.199 align:start position:0%

04:03:14.389 --> 04:03:14.399 align:start position:0%
court program
 
04:03:17.510 --> 04:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
to try to prevent the recidivism that we
 
04:03:17.520 --> 04:03:18.469 align:start position:0%
to try to prevent the recidivism that we
see

04:03:18.469 --> 04:03:18.479 align:start position:0%

oh sorry representative rice you have a
 
04:03:34.080 --> 04:03:34.950 align:start position:0%
oh sorry representative rice you have a
question

04:03:34.950 --> 04:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:03:36.790 --> 04:03:36.800 align:start position:0%
just one question you said that this was
 
04:03:39.590 --> 04:03:39.600 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation but that they they
 
04:03:41.590 --> 04:03:41.600 align:start position:0%
have the ability to do it now but they
 
04:03:43.189 --> 04:03:43.199 align:start position:0%
don't do it
 
04:03:44.630 --> 04:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
that much
 
04:03:48.150 --> 04:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
why would this legislation make them
 
04:03:50.870 --> 04:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
do this more it would appear on the
 
04:03:52.550 --> 04:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
checklist of things the judge can go
 
04:03:55.110 --> 04:03:55.120 align:start position:0%
through when when issuing the parole and
 
04:03:56.870 --> 04:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
and be an item that comes and pops to
 
04:03:59.349 --> 04:03:59.359 align:start position:0%
mind more often in my opinion
 
04:04:02.150 --> 04:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
and i think that uh judge nato if she's
 
04:04:04.229 --> 04:04:04.239 align:start position:0%
going to be um
 
04:04:06.309 --> 04:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
speaking on this which i think she she
 
04:04:08.630 --> 04:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
told me she would be testifying um so i
 
04:04:10.630 --> 04:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
assume she's she's on deck to do so and
 
04:04:10.640 --> 04:04:11.269 align:start position:0%
assume she's she's on deck to do so and
i

04:04:11.269 --> 04:04:11.279 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:04:12.790 --> 04:04:12.800 align:start position:0%
i apologize for not knowing because i
 
04:04:15.110 --> 04:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
can't see the list of attendees
 
04:04:16.950 --> 04:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh normally i'm a
 
04:04:18.870 --> 04:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
technologist and i can see all that for
 
04:04:20.870 --> 04:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
the committee but i don't hear as just a
 
04:04:20.880 --> 04:04:22.790 align:start position:0%
the committee but i don't hear as just a
participant

04:04:22.790 --> 04:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
participant
 
04:04:25.670 --> 04:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
judge nadeau will be testifying next
 
04:04:27.189 --> 04:04:27.199 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair maybe i'll wait and
 
04:04:34.710 --> 04:04:34.720 align:start position:0%

04:04:37.110 --> 04:04:37.120 align:start position:0%

04:04:48.150 --> 04:04:48.160 align:start position:0%

04:04:49.750 --> 04:04:49.760 align:start position:0%

thank you members of the committee i
 
04:04:53.030 --> 04:04:53.040 align:start position:0%

04:04:56.229 --> 04:04:56.239 align:start position:0%
and we will call upon judge nadeau to
 
04:04:58.550 --> 04:04:58.560 align:start position:0%

04:05:00.870 --> 04:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
i understand that she has a hearing
 
04:05:03.590 --> 04:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
today and will be able to stay with us
 
04:05:05.670 --> 04:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
but she may have some comments on the
 
04:05:07.110 --> 04:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
next bill that we're going to hear this
 
04:05:08.630 --> 04:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
afternoon as well
 
04:05:11.750 --> 04:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:13.750 --> 04:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
hi there can you all hear me
 
04:05:14.710 --> 04:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
we can
 
04:05:16.550 --> 04:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
great thank you mr chairman and thank
 
04:05:18.229 --> 04:05:18.239 align:start position:0%
you members of the committee it's really
 
04:05:20.389 --> 04:05:20.399 align:start position:0%
an honor to be before you i wish we
 
04:05:21.750 --> 04:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
could be in person i'm sure you hear
 
04:05:23.030 --> 04:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
that all the time
 
04:05:25.510 --> 04:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
i did have a very good conversation with
 
04:05:27.750 --> 04:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of this bill we talked at
 
04:05:29.910 --> 04:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
length about drug court and how drug
 
04:05:32.150 --> 04:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
court works and while i don't have a
 
04:05:34.309 --> 04:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
strong opposition to this bill i don't
 
04:05:36.309 --> 04:05:36.319 align:start position:0%
think it's necessary and i do think it
 
04:05:38.309 --> 04:05:38.319 align:start position:0%
could cause some confusion
 
04:05:40.790 --> 04:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
among the drug court programs already in
 
04:05:43.030 --> 04:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
place it is obviously a well-intended
 
04:05:45.269 --> 04:05:45.279 align:start position:0%
bill and i'm always impressed when
 
04:05:47.110 --> 04:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
legislators have the ability to listen
 
04:05:49.590 --> 04:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
to their constituents and act promptly
 
04:05:50.950 --> 04:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
so let me just give you a quick
 
04:05:53.990 --> 04:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
thumbnail of why i think it would not be
 
04:05:55.910 --> 04:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
necessary first of all
 
04:05:58.309 --> 04:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
we have 10 operating felony adult drug
 
04:05:59.990 --> 04:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
courts in the state
 
04:06:03.670 --> 04:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
and all of them provide for
 
04:06:05.590 --> 04:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
mental health counseling
 
04:06:08.389 --> 04:06:08.399 align:start position:0%
case management services probation
 
04:06:10.710 --> 04:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
services and each individual
 
04:06:12.790 --> 04:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
participant in drug court is assessed
 
04:06:15.030 --> 04:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
for their individual needs
 
04:06:17.590 --> 04:06:17.600 align:start position:0%
and they are required to comply with an
 
04:06:19.990 --> 04:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
individualized treatment plan often that
 
04:06:22.870 --> 04:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
includes group counseling that includes
 
04:06:24.389 --> 04:06:24.399 align:start position:0%
substance use counseling mental health
 
04:06:26.070 --> 04:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
health counseling three hours a day
 
04:06:28.550 --> 04:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
three days a week it includes individual
 
04:06:30.469 --> 04:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
counseling it includes random drug
 
04:06:32.389 --> 04:06:32.399 align:start position:0%
testing it includes case management
 
04:06:32.399 --> 04:06:33.590 align:start position:0%
testing it includes case management
services

04:06:33.590 --> 04:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
services
 
04:06:36.550 --> 04:06:36.560 align:start position:0%
self-help groups and more and the
 
04:06:39.590 --> 04:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
program lasts between 18 and 24 months
 
04:06:41.830 --> 04:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
for some people it lasts longer
 
04:06:44.070 --> 04:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
and for those who graduate they still
 
04:06:46.710 --> 04:06:46.720 align:start position:0%
remain on probation for a year
 
04:06:48.070 --> 04:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
if they're coming out of the prison
 
04:06:50.070 --> 04:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
they'll remain on probate parole for a
 
04:06:52.389 --> 04:06:52.399 align:start position:0%
year so we can do some follow-up
 
04:06:56.469 --> 04:06:56.479 align:start position:0%
so i i do i think sometimes that parents
 
04:06:58.389 --> 04:06:58.399 align:start position:0%
and parents in law of people who are in
 
04:07:00.150 --> 04:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
drug court maybe get one side of the
 
04:07:00.160 --> 04:07:01.189 align:start position:0%
drug court maybe get one side of the
story

04:07:01.189 --> 04:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
story
 
04:07:03.590 --> 04:07:03.600 align:start position:0%
from the person who attended drug court
 
04:07:05.269 --> 04:07:05.279 align:start position:0%
you also have to keep in mind that the
 
04:07:07.429 --> 04:07:07.439 align:start position:0%
people that we're serving what we
 
04:07:09.510 --> 04:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
categorize and the target population is
 
04:07:11.670 --> 04:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
high risk high need that means there are
 
04:07:13.510 --> 04:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
people that would otherwise be headed to
 
04:07:15.189 --> 04:07:15.199 align:start position:0%
state prison if we didn't do something
 
04:07:17.349 --> 04:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
about the substance use disorder they
 
04:07:19.429 --> 04:07:19.439 align:start position:0%
are not dangerous but they're high risk
 
04:07:22.150 --> 04:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
for reoffending over and over again and
 
04:07:24.309 --> 04:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
their high need because they have a deep
 
04:07:26.389 --> 04:07:26.399 align:start position:0%
deep substance use disorder that started
 
04:07:27.910 --> 04:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
when they were young
 
04:07:30.630 --> 04:07:30.640 align:start position:0%
so we do provide mental health services
 
04:07:32.550 --> 04:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
social work services case management
 
04:07:35.429 --> 04:07:35.439 align:start position:0%
services and they are required in each
 
04:07:35.439 --> 04:07:37.030 align:start position:0%
services and they are required in each
program

04:07:37.030 --> 04:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:07:39.750 --> 04:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
some people engage better than others in
 
04:07:42.070 --> 04:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
the programming that we provide
 
04:07:44.229 --> 04:07:44.239 align:start position:0%
and my concern about this particular
 
04:07:47.349 --> 04:07:47.359 align:start position:0%
bill it indicates that if
 
04:07:49.429 --> 04:07:49.439 align:start position:0%
these services are ordered even though
 
04:07:51.030 --> 04:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
they're already provided
 
04:07:53.189 --> 04:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
they sh they the program shall be
 
04:07:55.590 --> 04:07:55.600 align:start position:0%
eligible for funding we are you already
 
04:07:57.590 --> 04:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
do fund drug courts which includes the
 
04:07:59.670 --> 04:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
mental health component and i've already
 
04:08:01.110 --> 04:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
gotten some calls from counties that
 
04:08:02.229 --> 04:08:02.239 align:start position:0%
think this means they're going to get
 
04:08:04.790 --> 04:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
extra funding and they're not just yet
 
04:08:06.550 --> 04:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
because we haven't asked for an increase
 
04:08:09.510 --> 04:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
since 2016 when you all passed statewide
 
04:08:11.830 --> 04:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
drug court so i believe it is well
 
04:08:14.469 --> 04:08:14.479 align:start position:0%
intended i believe it is unnecessary i
 
04:08:17.030 --> 04:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
do think it will cause some confusion
 
04:08:19.269 --> 04:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
and depending sometimes you have good
 
04:08:21.030 --> 04:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
probation officers sometimes you have
 
04:08:23.349 --> 04:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
ones that aren't as proactive but they
 
04:08:25.429 --> 04:08:25.439 align:start position:0%
do they are able to link up with those
 
04:08:27.830 --> 04:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
services even after they graduate from
 
04:08:30.229 --> 04:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
drug court and i i so appreciate the
 
04:08:32.150 --> 04:08:32.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity to talk right now and and
 
04:08:33.750 --> 04:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
with you recognizing that i have to get
 
04:08:36.309 --> 04:08:36.319 align:start position:0%
back on the bench for this second bill
 
04:08:38.309 --> 04:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
and i do have someone that will testify
 
04:08:40.229 --> 04:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
already so that it's part of the record
 
04:08:42.150 --> 04:08:42.160 align:start position:0%
but i have the same concerns regarding
 
04:08:43.510 --> 04:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
the second bill
 
04:08:45.990 --> 04:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
vocational and educational components
 
04:08:48.070 --> 04:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
are required for people who don't have a
 
04:08:50.870 --> 04:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
job they are required to get a ged
 
04:08:52.469 --> 04:08:52.479 align:start position:0%
or engage in training if it's
 
04:08:54.710 --> 04:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate to their recovery usually
 
04:08:56.950 --> 04:08:56.960 align:start position:0%
that happens near the end of drug court
 
04:08:59.030 --> 04:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
so we do have those services in place as
 
04:09:00.950 --> 04:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
well again somebody may or may not be as
 
04:09:03.030 --> 04:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
amenable to receiving them
 
04:09:04.790 --> 04:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
and the concern in the second bill is it
 
04:09:06.950 --> 04:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
talks about pre-adjudication we don't
 
04:09:08.790 --> 04:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
have any pre-adjudication drug court
 
04:09:10.870 --> 04:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
people have to plead guilty get a
 
04:09:12.950 --> 04:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
suspended sentence be on probation
 
04:09:15.830 --> 04:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
acknowledge their guilt be accountable
 
04:09:17.429 --> 04:09:17.439 align:start position:0%
before they're in drug court so that is
 
04:09:19.590 --> 04:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
my real thumbnail sketch of what we do
 
04:09:21.590 --> 04:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to answer questions and if
 
04:09:23.349 --> 04:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
there's any interest in the future when
 
04:09:24.630 --> 04:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
you're not swamped the way you're
 
04:09:26.550 --> 04:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
swamped of a full drug court
 
04:09:28.150 --> 04:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
presentation i'd be happy to provide
 
04:09:31.429 --> 04:09:31.439 align:start position:0%
that some time down the line as well
 
04:09:32.950 --> 04:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
04:09:34.309 --> 04:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
representative oregon did you have a
 
04:09:37.110 --> 04:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
question yes sure um
 
04:09:40.070 --> 04:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
my concern looking at it and i
 
04:09:40.080 --> 04:09:41.030 align:start position:0%
my concern looking at it and i
maybe

04:09:41.030 --> 04:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
04:09:43.429 --> 04:09:43.439 align:start position:0%
i may be able to put my concern to rest
 
04:09:45.429 --> 04:09:45.439 align:start position:0%
risk is it sounds like this is making uh
 
04:09:47.110 --> 04:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
participating in
 
04:09:49.349 --> 04:09:49.359 align:start position:0%
mental health counseling uh
 
04:09:50.550 --> 04:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
at least to a certain extent
 
04:09:52.309 --> 04:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
non-voluntary since you have to do it as
 
04:09:53.750 --> 04:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
part of your
 
04:09:53.760 --> 04:09:54.630 align:start position:0%
part of your
uh

04:09:54.630 --> 04:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:09:56.630 --> 04:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
basic your drug court program which is
 
04:09:59.349 --> 04:09:59.359 align:start position:0%
basically a form of uh probation so um
 
04:10:00.469 --> 04:10:00.479 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:10:03.670 --> 04:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
my concern uh well placed and um and
 
04:10:05.750 --> 04:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
then there already and i there are other
 
04:10:07.510 --> 04:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
cases where people uh
 
04:10:09.349 --> 04:10:09.359 align:start position:0%
are ordered to go i guess it must be
 
04:10:11.110 --> 04:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
ordered to go through you know mental
 
04:10:12.790 --> 04:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
health counseling or social work
 
04:10:14.950 --> 04:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
counseling well that that does happen
 
04:10:16.790 --> 04:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
that is a very good question drug court
 
04:10:19.429 --> 04:10:19.439 align:start position:0%
is voluntary someone only enters drug
 
04:10:21.910 --> 04:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
court if they agree to enter drug court
 
04:10:23.670 --> 04:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
once they've agreed to enter drug court
 
04:10:26.229 --> 04:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
they have to comply with the program
 
04:10:28.630 --> 04:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
requirements and some of them take them
 
04:10:30.550 --> 04:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
a while to get used to because they
 
04:10:31.990 --> 04:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
don't like having their time so
 
04:10:34.630 --> 04:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
scheduled but the program is voluntary
 
04:10:35.990 --> 04:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
they are required to follow the
 
04:10:38.309 --> 04:10:38.319 align:start position:0%
components of drug court and drug courts
 
04:10:40.790 --> 04:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
actually operate under very specific
 
04:10:42.950 --> 04:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
national standards we have books of
 
04:10:44.710 --> 04:10:44.720 align:start position:0%
standards that have been you know the
 
04:10:46.309 --> 04:10:46.319 align:start position:0%
elements of drug court have been studied
 
04:10:48.389 --> 04:10:48.399 align:start position:0%
empirically so that's why i think it's
 
04:10:49.510 --> 04:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
also important to stick with the
 
04:10:51.429 --> 04:10:51.439 align:start position:0%
national standards
 
04:10:52.710 --> 04:10:52.720 align:start position:0%
when someone is just on regular
 
04:10:54.710 --> 04:10:54.720 align:start position:0%
probation without drug court a probation
 
04:10:56.550 --> 04:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
officer may recommend that they get
 
04:10:58.389 --> 04:10:58.399 align:start position:0%
mental health counseling and if they
 
04:11:00.150 --> 04:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
don't follow through it could constitute
 
04:11:01.990 --> 04:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
a violation of probation but that's a
 
04:11:04.830 --> 04:11:04.840 align:start position:0%
great question great thank you
 
04:11:10.550 --> 04:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:12.389 --> 04:11:12.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you judge
 
04:11:15.269 --> 04:11:15.279 align:start position:0%
nato for taking my question and this is
 
04:11:18.630 --> 04:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
a short one um you said that services
 
04:11:20.790 --> 04:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
are available while folks are in the
 
04:11:22.309 --> 04:11:22.319 align:start position:0%
drug um
 
04:11:24.070 --> 04:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
court program
 
04:11:26.950 --> 04:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
so as far as the services
 
04:11:28.550 --> 04:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
are those and you said they're already
 
04:11:31.990 --> 04:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
funded are those services um chargeable
 
04:11:33.349 --> 04:11:33.359 align:start position:0%
to the
 
04:11:36.469 --> 04:11:36.479 align:start position:0%
person's medical insurance
 
04:11:38.469 --> 04:11:38.479 align:start position:0%
that's a good question if someone has
 
04:11:40.389 --> 04:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
insurance they
 
04:11:42.309 --> 04:11:42.319 align:start position:0%
their treatment can be covered by
 
04:11:42.319 --> 04:11:43.510 align:start position:0%
their treatment can be covered by
insurance

04:11:43.510 --> 04:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
04:11:46.150 --> 04:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
90 percent 95 percent of the people we
 
04:11:49.110 --> 04:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
see in drug court do not have insurance
 
04:11:50.710 --> 04:11:50.720 align:start position:0%
some of them are medicaid eligible
 
04:11:52.710 --> 04:11:52.720 align:start position:0%
because now we are a medicaid expansion
 
04:11:54.550 --> 04:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
state so that's why we don't have to
 
04:11:56.309 --> 04:11:56.319 align:start position:0%
fully fund the drug courts they're able
 
04:11:58.790 --> 04:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
to get reimbursement for their services
 
04:12:00.550 --> 04:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
through medicaid
 
04:12:02.710 --> 04:12:02.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:12:06.070 --> 04:12:06.080 align:start position:0%

the requirements that uh
 
04:30:02.790 --> 04:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
the court and again it's an enabling
 
04:30:05.349 --> 04:30:05.359 align:start position:0%
bill it allows the judge to order that
 
04:30:07.830 --> 04:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
that a particular participant
 
04:30:10.469 --> 04:30:10.479 align:start position:0%
as part of their graduation from drug
 
04:30:13.110 --> 04:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
court must participate in
 
04:30:13.120 --> 04:30:14.469 align:start position:0%
court must participate in
vocational

04:30:14.469 --> 04:30:14.479 align:start position:0%
vocational
 
04:30:16.550 --> 04:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
educational programs
 
04:30:18.710 --> 04:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
to give them a different career to fall
 
04:30:19.910 --> 04:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
back on
 
04:30:22.229 --> 04:30:22.239 align:start position:0%
the problem that my constituent had was
 
04:30:26.149 --> 04:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
that her son-in-law had only ever
 
04:30:28.070 --> 04:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
had a career of selling drugs from the
 
04:30:30.389 --> 04:30:30.399 align:start position:0%
time he was a very young man
 
04:30:30.399 --> 04:30:31.910 align:start position:0%
time he was a very young man
and

04:30:31.910 --> 04:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:30:34.950 --> 04:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
they were very afraid as a family uh
 
04:30:37.030 --> 04:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
afraid for
 
04:30:40.070 --> 04:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
her daughter and his children and the
 
04:30:42.070 --> 04:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
ability to sustain themselves as a
 
04:30:45.510 --> 04:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
family if if he was not able to
 
04:30:47.189 --> 04:30:47.199 align:start position:0%
transition into something other than
 
04:30:48.790 --> 04:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
drug selling and they wanted to be able
 
04:30:51.349 --> 04:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
to give him an opportunity
 
04:30:53.269 --> 04:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
to have some other
 
04:30:55.429 --> 04:30:55.439 align:start position:0%
course of action other than falling back
 
04:30:58.389 --> 04:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
on what he considered easy money
 
04:30:58.399 --> 04:31:00.070 align:start position:0%
on what he considered easy money
and

04:31:00.070 --> 04:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:31:01.590 --> 04:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
i understand that some of this is
 
04:31:04.870 --> 04:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
already done as as judge nadeau has uh
 
04:31:04.880 --> 04:31:07.750 align:start position:0%
already done as as judge nadeau has uh
explained

04:31:07.750 --> 04:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:11.189 --> 04:31:11.199 align:start position:0%
this however puts it on the radar
 
04:31:12.870 --> 04:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
for the court
 
04:31:15.269 --> 04:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
so that they they can actually order
 
04:31:17.510 --> 04:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
that that somebody who has no skills and
 
04:31:20.229 --> 04:31:20.239 align:start position:0%
has no alternative to go to
 
04:31:22.389 --> 04:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
should complete these programs not just
 
04:31:23.990 --> 04:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
participate in them but actually
 
04:31:26.229 --> 04:31:26.239 align:start position:0%
complete them successfully
 
04:31:28.229 --> 04:31:28.239 align:start position:0%
before they can be graduated from drug
 
04:31:29.990 --> 04:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
court and their probation that follows
 
04:31:31.349 --> 04:31:31.359 align:start position:0%
drug court
 
04:31:34.550 --> 04:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
and i i will point out here i i think
 
04:31:35.830 --> 04:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
there might have been some confusion
 
04:31:37.990 --> 04:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
because judge nato talked on two bills
 
04:31:39.750 --> 04:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
when before she left
 
04:31:42.149 --> 04:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
she talked about the pre-adjudication
 
04:31:42.159 --> 04:31:43.189 align:start position:0%
she talked about the pre-adjudication
aspect

04:31:43.189 --> 04:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
aspect
 
04:31:45.990 --> 04:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
there's no pre-adjudication in hb 212 we
 
04:31:47.349 --> 04:31:47.359 align:start position:0%
heard earlier
 
04:31:49.349 --> 04:31:49.359 align:start position:0%
there's no mention of that at all it's
 
04:31:51.269 --> 04:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
only here in this one
 
04:31:53.349 --> 04:31:53.359 align:start position:0%
and this is because they put in
 
04:31:55.830 --> 04:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
pre-adjudication post-adjudication or a
 
04:31:57.670 --> 04:31:57.680 align:start position:0%
combination program
 
04:31:59.429 --> 04:31:59.439 align:start position:0%
and the reason they did it that way was
 
04:32:00.550 --> 04:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
so that
 
04:32:03.990 --> 04:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
prior to the the complainant
 
04:32:05.750 --> 04:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
agreeing to the drug court and pleading
 
04:32:08.469 --> 04:32:08.479 align:start position:0%
guilty they could present the fact that
 
04:32:09.990 --> 04:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
this would be
 
04:32:12.630 --> 04:32:12.640 align:start position:0%
uh a requirement was that vocational
 
04:32:14.550 --> 04:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
training was going to be required and so
 
04:32:15.990 --> 04:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
they could have all the information when
 
04:32:18.389 --> 04:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
they decide to volunteer for drug court
 
04:32:20.469 --> 04:32:20.479 align:start position:0%
that part of that was going to be dr job
 
04:32:22.870 --> 04:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
skills training and that they needed to
 
04:32:24.870 --> 04:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
know ahead of time before they did their
 
04:32:26.469 --> 04:32:26.479 align:start position:0%
guilty plea and entered the drug court
 
04:32:28.550 --> 04:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
program that that they'd be required to
 
04:32:31.910 --> 04:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
find a profession and and do something
 
04:32:34.550 --> 04:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
um now as you know vocational training
 
04:32:36.149 --> 04:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
can take a lot of aspects they could
 
04:32:39.830 --> 04:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
choose anything they want to but
 
04:32:39.840 --> 04:32:41.269 align:start position:0%
choose anything they want to but
um

04:32:41.269 --> 04:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:44.550 --> 04:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
i'm going outside of my standard
 
04:32:46.229 --> 04:32:46.239 align:start position:0%
conservative republican bounds by
 
04:32:47.510 --> 04:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
presenting this bill because i
 
04:32:49.189 --> 04:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
04:32:50.469 --> 04:32:50.479 align:start position:0%
this is
 
04:32:52.870 --> 04:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
allocating funds
 
04:32:54.870 --> 04:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
for a new program
 
04:32:56.550 --> 04:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
and i may be
 
04:32:58.710 --> 04:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
opposed by a lot of republicans but i
 
04:33:00.389 --> 04:33:00.399 align:start position:0%
feel that
 
04:33:02.550 --> 04:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
any investment and i think i'm backed up
 
04:33:04.949 --> 04:33:04.959 align:start position:0%
by facts any investment that we do to
 
04:33:06.709 --> 04:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
try to prevent
 
04:33:06.719 --> 04:33:07.510 align:start position:0%
try to prevent
that

04:33:07.510 --> 04:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:33:09.269 --> 04:33:09.279 align:start position:0%
person who dealt in drugs from going
 
04:33:11.990 --> 04:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
back to drug dealing is a savings in the
 
04:33:14.390 --> 04:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
long run on the community and on that
 
04:33:16.709 --> 04:33:16.719 align:start position:0%
that person and the cost of the state
 
04:33:18.470 --> 04:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
and i believe that the investment that
 
04:33:20.230 --> 04:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
we might take under putting someone
 
04:33:22.869 --> 04:33:22.879 align:start position:0%
through vocational education programs as
 
04:33:25.349 --> 04:33:25.359 align:start position:0%
part of their drug court as a state
 
04:33:27.109 --> 04:33:27.119 align:start position:0%
is going to pay back
 
04:33:30.230 --> 04:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
this state and the members of this state
 
04:33:31.750 --> 04:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
in the long run
 
04:33:31.760 --> 04:33:32.869 align:start position:0%
in the long run
by

04:33:32.869 --> 04:33:32.879 align:start position:0%
by
 
04:33:32.879 --> 04:33:34.150 align:start position:0%
by
offering

04:33:34.150 --> 04:33:34.160 align:start position:0%
offering
 
04:33:37.109 --> 04:33:37.119 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to flourish under
 
04:33:37.119 --> 04:33:38.629 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to flourish under
normal

04:33:38.629 --> 04:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
normal
 
04:33:41.189 --> 04:33:41.199 align:start position:0%
job opportunities and prevent somebody
 
04:33:43.750 --> 04:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
from going back to drug dealing
 
04:33:45.109 --> 04:33:45.119 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
04:33:47.510 --> 04:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
essentially what i have to say here
 
04:33:48.949 --> 04:33:48.959 align:start position:0%
i'll take any questions if anyone has
 
04:33:48.959 --> 04:33:50.551 align:start position:0%
i'll take any questions if anyone has
them

04:33:50.551 --> 04:33:50.561 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:33:52.470 --> 04:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
are any questions for representative
 
04:33:52.480 --> 04:33:55.269 align:start position:0%
are any questions for representative

04:33:57.510 --> 04:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
representative mclean
 
04:33:58.869 --> 04:33:58.879 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
04:34:01.189 --> 04:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question just to follow up on
 
04:34:04.629 --> 04:34:04.639 align:start position:0%
on the free adjudication um aspect of
 
04:34:06.390 --> 04:34:06.400 align:start position:0%
this which i think was one of the
 
04:34:09.109 --> 04:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
concerns of of judge nato specifically
 
04:34:10.470 --> 04:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
with this bill
 
04:34:11.869 --> 04:34:11.879 align:start position:0%
if it it's a part of the
 
04:34:13.670 --> 04:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
pre-adjudication you kind of think
 
04:34:15.750 --> 04:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
you're going down one path
 
04:34:18.150 --> 04:34:18.160 align:start position:0%
but then you go through and you actually
 
04:34:19.670 --> 04:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
plead guilty
 
04:34:22.230 --> 04:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
um does that tie
 
04:34:22.240 --> 04:34:23.189 align:start position:0%
um does that tie
down

04:34:23.189 --> 04:34:23.199 align:start position:0%
down
 
04:34:24.470 --> 04:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
what um
 
04:34:24.480 --> 04:34:25.189 align:start position:0%
what um
the

04:34:25.189 --> 04:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:34:28.150 --> 04:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
the judge is able to do um and take away
 
04:34:29.429 --> 04:34:29.439 align:start position:0%
latitude because it's been
 
04:34:31.510 --> 04:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
pre-adjudicated how would that work in
 
04:34:31.520 --> 04:34:35.109 align:start position:0%
pre-adjudicated how would that work in
practice

04:34:35.109 --> 04:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:35.119 --> 04:34:36.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:34:36.230 --> 04:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:37.830 --> 04:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
i wish she was here to answer that
 
04:34:40.629 --> 04:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
because as a judge she's got
 
04:34:42.789 --> 04:34:42.799 align:start position:0%
far more experience than i do on how
 
04:34:44.869 --> 04:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
that actually works out in practice my
 
04:34:44.879 --> 04:34:46.789 align:start position:0%
that actually works out in practice my
understanding

04:34:46.789 --> 04:34:46.799 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
04:34:47.830 --> 04:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:34:49.590 --> 04:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
it gives the judge the ability
 
04:34:52.390 --> 04:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
pre-adjudication to say
 
04:34:55.269 --> 04:34:55.279 align:start position:0%
as part of your
 
04:34:55.279 --> 04:34:56.709 align:start position:0%
as part of your
your

04:34:56.709 --> 04:34:56.719 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:34:58.789 --> 04:34:58.799 align:start position:0%
going through probation and and the
 
04:35:03.109 --> 04:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
programs you will be required to take
 
04:35:04.390 --> 04:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
through the drug court you will be
 
04:35:06.789 --> 04:35:06.799 align:start position:0%
required to take vocational training you
 
04:35:08.709 --> 04:35:08.719 align:start position:0%
know you may choose which area of
 
04:35:10.949 --> 04:35:10.959 align:start position:0%
vocational training you go into but you
 
04:35:12.869 --> 04:35:12.879 align:start position:0%
will be required to take it and complete
 
04:35:12.879 --> 04:35:14.150 align:start position:0%
will be required to take it and complete
it

04:35:14.150 --> 04:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:35:15.429 --> 04:35:15.439 align:start position:0%
which may mean
 
04:35:15.439 --> 04:35:16.869 align:start position:0%
which may mean
that

04:35:16.869 --> 04:35:16.879 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:35:18.949 --> 04:35:18.959 align:start position:0%
in some instances their probation is
 
04:35:20.869 --> 04:35:20.879 align:start position:0%
extended to the end of the time that
 
04:35:22.949 --> 04:35:22.959 align:start position:0%
they finish their program
 
04:35:24.390 --> 04:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
because they need to complete their
 
04:35:24.400 --> 04:35:25.590 align:start position:0%
because they need to complete their
program

04:35:25.590 --> 04:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:35:27.029 --> 04:35:27.039 align:start position:0%
but i think that
 
04:35:27.039 --> 04:35:27.830 align:start position:0%
but i think that
it's

04:35:27.830 --> 04:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:35:29.670 --> 04:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
it's a good thing in the long run and i
 
04:35:31.429 --> 04:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
don't believe this has any impact if
 
04:35:32.949 --> 04:35:32.959 align:start position:0%
they choose not to go into the drug
 
04:35:35.269 --> 04:35:35.279 align:start position:0%
court because this is tied directly to
 
04:35:37.590 --> 04:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
entering the drug court so if they are
 
04:35:40.310 --> 04:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
told prior to adjudication that this is
 
04:35:43.429 --> 04:35:43.439 align:start position:0%
going to be a contingency and it's
 
04:35:45.590 --> 04:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
and it's part of entering the drug court
 
04:35:45.600 --> 04:35:46.789 align:start position:0%
and it's part of entering the drug court
program

04:35:46.789 --> 04:35:46.799 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:35:49.189 --> 04:35:49.199 align:start position:0%
it would still remain in effect when
 
04:35:51.510 --> 04:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
they enter the program
 
04:35:54.150 --> 04:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
but if they decided to
 
04:35:56.470 --> 04:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
wave off the program and just go to jail
 
04:35:58.230 --> 04:35:58.240 align:start position:0%
and through the regular process and not
 
04:36:00.150 --> 04:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
go through the drug court program
 
04:36:01.990 --> 04:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
obviously any
 
04:36:05.269 --> 04:36:05.279 align:start position:0%
any requirement that they
 
04:36:07.910 --> 04:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
entered into based on pre-adjudication
 
04:36:09.349 --> 04:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
for the drug court program is not
 
04:36:10.551 --> 04:36:10.561 align:start position:0%
applicable because they're no longer in
 
04:36:13.670 --> 04:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:15.429 --> 04:36:15.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:36:20.390 --> 04:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:22.310 --> 04:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much mr chair
 
04:36:23.590 --> 04:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
this is representative oregon from
 
04:36:24.869 --> 04:36:24.879 align:start position:0%
durham um
 
04:36:26.551 --> 04:36:26.561 align:start position:0%
my question is uh well i guess guess
 
04:36:28.470 --> 04:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
both these bills
 
04:36:29.910 --> 04:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
pay for uh
 
04:36:31.029 --> 04:36:31.039 align:start position:0%
pay for the things they're paying
 
04:36:34.551 --> 04:36:34.561 align:start position:0%
through through the uh drug uh
 
04:36:36.310 --> 04:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
the drug up
 
04:36:38.709 --> 04:36:38.719 align:start position:0%
the drug offender grant program so he
 
04:36:40.709 --> 04:36:40.719 align:start position:0%
tells a little bit more about what that
 
04:36:43.830 --> 04:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
is and where the money comes from and
 
04:36:45.590 --> 04:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
looks like he gives matching
 
04:36:49.189 --> 04:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
grants to the counties but where does he
 
04:36:52.789 --> 04:36:52.799 align:start position:0%
other half of it come from thanks
 
04:36:54.310 --> 04:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
thank you honorable horrigan i
 
04:36:55.990 --> 04:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate the question
 
04:36:58.150 --> 04:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
we do have funds from the federal
 
04:36:59.670 --> 04:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
government that are tied into our drug
 
04:37:01.429 --> 04:37:01.439 align:start position:0%
court programs
 
04:37:03.750 --> 04:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
and we also have funds that we have
 
04:37:06.150 --> 04:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
allocated in our general fund to fund
 
04:37:08.709 --> 04:37:08.719 align:start position:0%
those programs and i believe so far we
 
04:37:11.349 --> 04:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
have seen it to be a great success
 
04:37:12.949 --> 04:37:12.959 align:start position:0%
in providing
 
04:37:15.189 --> 04:37:15.199 align:start position:0%
benefit to the communities and to the
 
04:37:16.789 --> 04:37:16.799 align:start position:0%
offenders who can
 
04:37:19.349 --> 04:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
successfully complete the program
 
04:37:21.830 --> 04:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
over the cost to the community and the
 
04:37:23.670 --> 04:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
cost to the state for someone who is
 
04:37:27.109 --> 04:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:29.590 --> 04:37:29.600 align:start position:0%

04:37:37.670 --> 04:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for
 
04:37:41.269 --> 04:37:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:43.910 --> 04:37:43.920 align:start position:0%

and

04:37:47.269 --> 04:37:47.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:37:48.949 --> 04:37:48.959 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to

04:37:52.480 --> 04:37:53.510 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:37:53.510 --> 04:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:38:03.189 --> 04:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:15.830 --> 04:38:15.840 align:start position:0%

04:38:21.269 --> 04:38:21.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:22.551 --> 04:38:22.561 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you members
 
04:38:24.230 --> 04:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is richard head
 
04:38:25.910 --> 04:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
i'm the government affairs coordinator
 
04:38:28.949 --> 04:38:28.959 align:start position:0%
for the judicial branch my primary
 
04:38:30.629 --> 04:38:30.639 align:start position:0%
ask is
 
04:38:32.869 --> 04:38:32.879 align:start position:0%
as you heard in the testimony for house
 
04:38:34.629 --> 04:38:34.639 align:start position:0%
bill 212
 
04:38:37.349 --> 04:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
judge nato was unavailable for this
 
04:38:37.359 --> 04:38:38.390 align:start position:0%
judge nato was unavailable for this
hearing

04:38:38.390 --> 04:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
04:38:39.990 --> 04:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
because she had to go on the bench for a
 
04:38:41.830 --> 04:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
1 30 hearing
 
04:38:45.429 --> 04:38:45.439 align:start position:0%
we asked that her testimony during the
 
04:38:47.269 --> 04:38:47.279 align:start position:0%
testimony for house bill 212 be
 
04:38:51.269 --> 04:38:51.279 align:start position:0%
incorporated into house bill 569.
 
04:38:54.070 --> 04:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
i am by no means an expert in drug court
 
04:38:55.990 --> 04:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
the way judge nato is
 
04:38:58.629 --> 04:38:58.639 align:start position:0%
um if you do have additional questions
 
04:39:01.590 --> 04:39:01.600 align:start position:0%
for her she is planning on being uh in
 
04:39:04.230 --> 04:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
attendance for the two o'clock bill uh
 
04:39:08.551 --> 04:39:08.561 align:start position:0%
house bill 578 um and i don't know if
 
04:39:10.709 --> 04:39:10.719 align:start position:0%
mr chairman if he wanted to suspend so
 
04:39:12.470 --> 04:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
that an additional question can go to
 
04:39:12.480 --> 04:39:13.269 align:start position:0%
that an additional question can go to
her

04:39:13.269 --> 04:39:13.279 align:start position:0%
her
 
04:39:14.949 --> 04:39:14.959 align:start position:0%
at the very beginning at two o'clock
 
04:39:16.470 --> 04:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
when she gets on but
 
04:39:18.949 --> 04:39:18.959 align:start position:0%
she will be coming back for that bill uh
 
04:39:21.429 --> 04:39:21.439 align:start position:0%
when her hearing is over
 
04:39:22.390 --> 04:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
the other
 
04:39:23.910 --> 04:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
part of the bill
 
04:39:27.029 --> 04:39:27.039 align:start position:0%
in both bills these as judge nato said
 
04:39:29.029 --> 04:39:29.039 align:start position:0%
these are long involved programs that
 
04:39:31.269 --> 04:39:31.279 align:start position:0%
can take years to complete
 
04:39:33.510 --> 04:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
those are you know the needs are
 
04:39:35.910 --> 04:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
assessed throughout the the time that an
 
04:39:37.990 --> 04:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
individual is in that program
 
04:39:40.628 --> 04:39:40.638 align:start position:0%
uh there are evolving needs that can
 
04:39:42.550 --> 04:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
occur during the course of these these
 
04:39:45.190 --> 04:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
programs uh as a participant goes
 
04:39:47.190 --> 04:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
through them but they can be very
 
04:39:50.628 --> 04:39:50.638 align:start position:0%
long-term uh and they're quite involved
 
04:39:52.390 --> 04:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
and have a number of
 
04:39:52.400 --> 04:39:53.270 align:start position:0%
and have a number of
of

04:39:53.270 --> 04:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:39:56.310 --> 04:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
uh specialties or or areas that services
 
04:39:57.990 --> 04:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
are provided not just the ones that are
 
04:39:59.750 --> 04:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
included in these bills
 
04:40:02.948 --> 04:40:02.958 align:start position:0%
but as judge nato uh indicated in her
 
04:40:05.750 --> 04:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
prior testimony vocational services are
 
04:40:07.750 --> 04:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
currently part of the program
 
04:40:10.230 --> 04:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
uh and for the reasons that she uh
 
04:40:12.310 --> 04:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
discussed in her testimony we believe
 
04:40:16.948 --> 04:40:16.958 align:start position:0%
that this bill would is not necessary
 
04:40:19.590 --> 04:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
and with regard to the pre-adjudication
 
04:40:21.990 --> 04:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
issue it does talk about drug court
 
04:40:24.670 --> 04:40:24.680 align:start position:0%
and really that has not occurred
 
04:40:27.190 --> 04:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
pre-adjudication so the drug court
 
04:40:29.590 --> 04:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
is not actually operating
 
04:40:31.430 --> 04:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
pre-adjudication relative to an
 
04:40:31.440 --> 04:40:32.788 align:start position:0%
pre-adjudication relative to an
individual

04:40:32.788 --> 04:40:32.798 align:start position:0%
individual
 
04:40:34.708 --> 04:40:34.718 align:start position:0%
so just the the
 
04:40:37.750 --> 04:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
timing there would not make sense
 
04:40:39.510 --> 04:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to answer any questions but
 
04:40:41.270 --> 04:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
as i said before i'm by no means the
 
04:40:44.868 --> 04:40:44.878 align:start position:0%
drug court expert thank you very much
 
04:40:46.708 --> 04:40:46.718 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for attorney
 
04:40:46.718 --> 04:40:48.230 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for attorney

head
 
04:40:51.590 --> 04:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
yes representative chase
 
04:40:53.350 --> 04:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my
 
04:40:53.360 --> 04:40:54.948 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my
question

04:40:54.948 --> 04:40:54.958 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:40:57.430 --> 04:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
as i read this so would this be like
 
04:40:59.510 --> 04:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
having to have people go actually
 
04:41:02.390 --> 04:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
through a vocational school or where we
 
04:41:05.910 --> 04:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
need so many um apprenticeships
 
04:41:08.070 --> 04:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
say plumbing heating that type of thing
 
04:41:08.080 --> 04:41:09.030 align:start position:0%
say plumbing heating that type of thing
could

04:41:09.030 --> 04:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
could
 
04:41:10.948 --> 04:41:10.958 align:start position:0%
the public offer
 
04:41:13.430 --> 04:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
a position where they would
 
04:41:15.670 --> 04:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
take someone under their wing and teach
 
04:41:17.670 --> 04:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
them or would it have to be
 
04:41:21.270 --> 04:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
a actual program do you know you know i
 
04:41:22.708 --> 04:41:22.718 align:start position:0%
i don't know specifically i think
 
04:41:24.788 --> 04:41:24.798 align:start position:0%
there's a great deal of flexibility in
 
04:41:26.868 --> 04:41:26.878 align:start position:0%
terms of the vocational training that
 
04:41:28.550 --> 04:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
can go on
 
04:41:30.868 --> 04:41:30.878 align:start position:0%
i will note that the bill also says you
 
04:41:32.948 --> 04:41:32.958 align:start position:0%
know the drug court may which is which
 
04:41:35.190 --> 04:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
is really adopting what is currently
 
04:41:36.948 --> 04:41:36.958 align:start position:0%
happening you know that is always an
 
04:41:39.590 --> 04:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
option and it is in fact part of the
 
04:41:41.910 --> 04:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
the program analysis that is that is
 
04:41:44.390 --> 04:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
done for every individual the specifics
 
04:41:47.110 --> 04:41:47.120 align:start position:0%
as to who actually is able you know
 
04:41:49.110 --> 04:41:49.120 align:start position:0%
does the vocational training
 
04:41:51.110 --> 04:41:51.120 align:start position:0%
um i think the there's a great deal of
 
04:41:53.430 --> 04:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
flexibility there but i don't
 
04:41:57.670 --> 04:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:00.788 --> 04:42:00.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:02.070 --> 04:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for
 
04:42:06.390 --> 04:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:08.150 --> 04:42:08.160 align:start position:0%

yes sir if that would be appropriate i
 
04:42:28.868 --> 04:42:28.878 align:start position:0%
wanted to make a comment on on the um
 
04:42:30.070 --> 04:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
the the
 
04:42:32.070 --> 04:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
using of the word may
 
04:42:34.470 --> 04:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
um as i mentioned this was an enabling
 
04:42:36.948 --> 04:42:36.958 align:start position:0%
bill and after my discussions with judge
 
04:42:38.390 --> 04:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
nato she said that it would not
 
04:42:39.990 --> 04:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
interfere in any way with what they
 
04:42:42.230 --> 04:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
currently do if we said may it would
 
04:42:44.230 --> 04:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
just formalize what they currently do so
 
04:42:46.310 --> 04:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
that it was more of a documented
 
04:42:46.320 --> 04:42:47.590 align:start position:0%
that it was more of a documented
formalized

04:42:47.590 --> 04:42:47.600 align:start position:0%
formalized
 
04:42:49.990 --> 04:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
aspect of the process
 
04:42:52.310 --> 04:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
rather than an informal
 
04:42:54.310 --> 04:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
something that's done without any kind
 
04:42:56.628 --> 04:42:56.638 align:start position:0%
of of
 
04:42:56.638 --> 04:43:00.790 align:start position:0%

04:59:46.868 --> 04:59:46.878 align:start position:0%
commission report
 
04:59:50.948 --> 04:59:50.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:52.788 --> 04:59:52.798 align:start position:0%
you should have received more details
 
04:59:55.030 --> 04:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
about the commission that met
 
04:59:56.788 --> 04:59:56.798 align:start position:0%
during that time
 
04:59:59.270 --> 04:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
the commission didn't identify specific
 
05:00:01.350 --> 05:00:01.360 align:start position:0%
details of what we believe the court
 
05:00:02.868 --> 05:00:02.878 align:start position:0%
should do
 
05:00:05.110 --> 05:00:05.120 align:start position:0%
instead we recognized
 
05:00:07.270 --> 05:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
that the court is already moving in the
 
05:00:08.628 --> 05:00:08.638 align:start position:0%
right direction
 
05:00:12.708 --> 05:00:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:14.708 --> 05:00:14.718 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's courts have already
 
05:00:14.718 --> 05:00:16.070 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's courts have already
implemented

05:00:16.070 --> 05:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
implemented
 
05:00:18.070 --> 05:00:18.080 align:start position:0%
drug courts consistently around the
 
05:00:18.080 --> 05:00:19.430 align:start position:0%
drug courts consistently around the
state

05:00:19.430 --> 05:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:00:21.590 --> 05:00:21.600 align:start position:0%
they based them on best practices that
 
05:00:25.030 --> 05:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
were have been defined nationally
 
05:00:27.830 --> 05:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
they haven't yet implemented mental
 
05:00:29.910 --> 05:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
health courts consistently across the
 
05:00:29.920 --> 05:00:31.030 align:start position:0%
health courts consistently across the
state

05:00:31.030 --> 05:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:00:33.430 --> 05:00:33.440 align:start position:0%
due in part to the lack of best
 
05:00:33.440 --> 05:00:34.868 align:start position:0%
due in part to the lack of best
practices

05:00:34.868 --> 05:00:34.878 align:start position:0%
practices
 
05:00:35.830 --> 05:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
that have
 
05:00:37.910 --> 05:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
need to be defined now still need to be
 
05:00:40.550 --> 05:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
defined nationally
 
05:00:43.430 --> 05:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
it's time that new hampshire
 
05:00:46.550 --> 05:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
take responsibility for defining our own
 
05:00:48.550 --> 05:00:48.560 align:start position:0%
best practices
 
05:00:50.470 --> 05:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
modeled after
 
05:00:52.550 --> 05:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
mental health courts
 
05:00:54.868 --> 05:00:54.878 align:start position:0%
in our counties that have already proven
 
05:00:57.510 --> 05:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
their ability to identify those people
 
05:00:59.590 --> 05:00:59.600 align:start position:0%
who have committed crimes
 
05:01:01.270 --> 05:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
influenced by their mental health
 
05:01:01.280 --> 05:01:02.550 align:start position:0%
influenced by their mental health
conditions

05:01:02.550 --> 05:01:02.560 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
05:01:05.670 --> 05:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
and provide paths to bring them into
 
05:01:07.990 --> 05:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
back into the community at large as
 
05:01:10.948 --> 05:01:10.958 align:start position:0%
productive citizens
 
05:01:10.958 --> 05:01:13.590 align:start position:0%
productive citizens
so

05:01:13.590 --> 05:01:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:16.948 --> 05:01:16.958 align:start position:0%
to do this we need to task the courts
 
05:01:19.110 --> 05:01:19.120 align:start position:0%
with developing their own plan for
 
05:01:21.750 --> 05:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
rolling out state mental health courts
 
05:01:24.230 --> 05:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
throughout the state adhering to the
 
05:01:29.590 --> 05:01:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:31.990 --> 05:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
the court through the chief justices
 
05:01:34.150 --> 05:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
office and the judicial branch of our
 
05:01:36.868 --> 05:01:36.878 align:start position:0%
government needs to develop and own the
 
05:01:40.070 --> 05:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility for a rollout plan
 
05:01:41.910 --> 05:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
they are responsible for keeping the
 
05:01:44.948 --> 05:01:44.958 align:start position:0%
legislative and executive branches aware
 
05:01:47.350 --> 05:01:47.360 align:start position:0%
of the resources they need
 
05:01:49.270 --> 05:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
to implement the plan
 
05:01:51.910 --> 05:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
including manpower facilities use of
 
05:01:54.470 --> 05:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
external health care resources
 
05:01:57.590 --> 05:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
the cost and most importantly the cost
 
05:02:01.110 --> 05:02:01.120 align:start position:0%
savings associated with their plan
 
05:02:03.110 --> 05:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
these are the reasons for bringing this
 
05:02:06.070 --> 05:02:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:08.470 --> 05:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
you will hear more about the reasons why
 
05:02:11.430 --> 05:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
we need to test the chief justices
 
05:02:14.230 --> 05:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
office to bring a plan forward during
 
05:02:15.830 --> 05:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
this hearing
 
05:02:18.070 --> 05:02:18.080 align:start position:0%
our our mental health courts and the
 
05:02:18.080 --> 05:02:19.190 align:start position:0%
our our mental health courts and the
benefits

05:02:19.190 --> 05:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
05:02:22.550 --> 05:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
to the state are worth the effort
 
05:02:24.948 --> 05:02:24.958 align:start position:0%
these courts benefit the state the
 
05:02:26.788 --> 05:02:26.798 align:start position:0%
residents of new hampshire
 
05:02:28.470 --> 05:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
our constituents
 
05:02:30.070 --> 05:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
and the people who have been charged
 
05:02:32.230 --> 05:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
with crimes they have committed
 
05:02:33.670 --> 05:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
due in part
 
05:02:37.510 --> 05:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:39.750 --> 05:02:39.760 align:start position:0%

questions
 
05:02:51.990 --> 05:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
i believe that there's other people
 
05:02:54.150 --> 05:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
on the list who'll be better able to
 
05:02:55.990 --> 05:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
address them

05:03:57.110 --> 05:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:03:59.030 --> 05:03:59.040 align:start position:0%

how mental health court has changed my
 
05:04:11.110 --> 05:04:11.120 align:start position:0%
life i have to give you a little bit of
 
05:04:12.470 --> 05:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
my background
 
05:04:14.470 --> 05:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
i will not get into too much detail and
 
05:04:16.788 --> 05:04:16.798 align:start position:0%
respect for everyone's time
 
05:04:18.788 --> 05:04:18.798 align:start position:0%
i am open to answering any questions
 
05:04:20.628 --> 05:04:20.638 align:start position:0%
after i conclude
 
05:04:22.550 --> 05:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
i will start by saying that my childhood
 
05:04:24.788 --> 05:04:24.798 align:start position:0%
included many forms of trauma
 
05:04:27.270 --> 05:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
this trauma affected my my choices
 
05:04:28.788 --> 05:04:28.798 align:start position:0%
throughout my life
 
05:04:30.948 --> 05:04:30.958 align:start position:0%
as a teen i found a coping mechanism
 
05:04:32.868 --> 05:04:32.878 align:start position:0%
which was drugs and alcohol
 
05:04:35.910 --> 05:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
i continued to self-medicate for years
 
05:04:37.990 --> 05:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
i also got into a very unhealthy
 
05:04:40.230 --> 05:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
relationship and became a teen mother at
 
05:04:42.070 --> 05:04:42.080 align:start position:0%
the age of 16.
 
05:04:43.270 --> 05:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
i always thought that there was
 
05:04:45.990 --> 05:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
something quote unquote wrong with me i
 
05:04:47.590 --> 05:04:47.600 align:start position:0%
didn't react to life the way other
 
05:04:49.750 --> 05:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
people did and i felt disconnected from
 
05:04:51.670 --> 05:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
the world
 
05:04:53.270 --> 05:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
the only thing i knew that helped was
 
05:04:54.948 --> 05:04:54.958 align:start position:0%
drugs and alcohol
 
05:04:56.628 --> 05:04:56.638 align:start position:0%
as years went by my unhealthy
 
05:04:58.628 --> 05:04:58.638 align:start position:0%
relationship got worse physical and
 
05:05:01.590 --> 05:05:01.600 align:start position:0%
mental abuse became a regular occurrence
 
05:05:05.830 --> 05:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
eventually on january 23 2014 my husband
 
05:05:08.708 --> 05:05:08.718 align:start position:0%
and i got into a physical altercation
 
05:05:10.868 --> 05:05:10.878 align:start position:0%
as a result i was arrested and charged
 
05:05:12.788 --> 05:05:12.798 align:start position:0%
with four felonies
 
05:05:14.628 --> 05:05:14.638 align:start position:0%
at this time i felt like my life was
 
05:05:16.788 --> 05:05:16.798 align:start position:0%
over and i had no hope
 
05:05:18.788 --> 05:05:18.798 align:start position:0%
the day i had court my public defender
 
05:05:20.948 --> 05:05:20.958 align:start position:0%
came to me and suggested i try community
 
05:05:22.628 --> 05:05:22.638 align:start position:0%
connections program
 
05:05:25.270 --> 05:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
i immediately thought i'm not crazy why
 
05:05:27.110 --> 05:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
would i go to mental health
 
05:05:29.270 --> 05:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
i had developed a stigma against mental
 
05:05:31.350 --> 05:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
health and believed it was a shameful
 
05:05:33.270 --> 05:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
thing to need help
 
05:05:35.670 --> 05:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
the the court liaison at that time
 
05:05:37.670 --> 05:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
explained the program in more detail to
 
05:05:40.230 --> 05:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
me and ultimately i decided to try it
 
05:05:42.708 --> 05:05:42.718 align:start position:0%
out what did i have to lose
 
05:05:44.708 --> 05:05:44.718 align:start position:0%
i didn't realize at that time but my
 
05:05:47.350 --> 05:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
life was about to change forever
 
05:05:49.510 --> 05:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
at my intake appointment a weight was
 
05:05:52.070 --> 05:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
lifted off my shoulders i was educated
 
05:05:54.550 --> 05:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
about my diagnosis and i was told there
 
05:05:57.590 --> 05:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
was treatment for me i finally felt like
 
05:05:59.510 --> 05:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
i was going to be okay
 
05:06:01.590 --> 05:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
i fully immersed myself into this
 
05:06:01.600 --> 05:06:02.628 align:start position:0%
i fully immersed myself into this
program

05:06:02.628 --> 05:06:02.638 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:06:04.788 --> 05:06:04.798 align:start position:0%
i got to work on myself and i continued
 
05:06:06.628 --> 05:06:06.638 align:start position:0%
to make progress throughout the entire
 
05:06:06.638 --> 05:06:07.670 align:start position:0%
to make progress throughout the entire
year

05:06:07.670 --> 05:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:06:09.670 --> 05:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
when i graduated i went up front of the
 
05:06:11.990 --> 05:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
court and i shared and with the new

05:12:09.030 --> 05:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
incarcerated in jails and prisons
 
05:12:12.708 --> 05:12:12.718 align:start position:0%
has just as dramatically increased
 
05:12:14.550 --> 05:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
while nami new hampshire firmly believes
 
05:12:16.230 --> 05:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
that people who commit serious crime
 
05:12:17.910 --> 05:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
should be prosecuted
 
05:12:19.830 --> 05:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
we are opposed to the increasing
 
05:12:21.590 --> 05:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
criminalization of individuals with
 
05:12:23.750 --> 05:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
mental illness
 
05:12:26.390 --> 05:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
the commission found that research
 
05:12:29.030 --> 05:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
indicates when implemented right that
 
05:12:31.190 --> 05:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
mental health courts reduce new arrests
 
05:12:33.750 --> 05:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
endangerment incarcerated
 
05:12:35.910 --> 05:12:35.920 align:start position:0%

05:12:38.390 --> 05:12:38.400 align:start position:0%

05:12:40.708 --> 05:12:40.718 align:start position:0%
health com health outcomes and most
 
05:12:44.708 --> 05:12:44.718 align:start position:0%
significantly reduce human suffering
 
05:12:46.310 --> 05:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
but we know there are not enough mental
 
05:12:47.750 --> 05:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
health course nationally and certainly
 
05:12:49.510 --> 05:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
not here in new hampshire as you've
 
05:12:51.430 --> 05:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
heard we have we have mental health
 
05:12:54.390 --> 05:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
courts in only six counties
 
05:12:56.628 --> 05:12:56.638 align:start position:0%
those mental health courts have been
 
05:12:58.628 --> 05:12:58.638 align:start position:0%
driven by several factors most notably
 
05:13:00.550 --> 05:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
strong community partnerships that
 
05:13:02.390 --> 05:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
include judges and investment of money
 
05:13:04.708 --> 05:13:04.718 align:start position:0%
and resources by their counties
 
05:13:06.310 --> 05:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
although the work of these mental health
 
05:13:08.310 --> 05:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
courts is commendable
 
05:13:09.750 --> 05:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
this peace mental approach has
 
05:13:11.590 --> 05:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
inequities your access to a mental
 
05:13:13.510 --> 05:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
health court depends upon where you
 
05:13:16.628 --> 05:13:16.638 align:start position:0%
arrested and sometimes where you reside
 
05:13:18.628 --> 05:13:18.638 align:start position:0%
nearly weekly at nami new hampshire we
 
05:13:20.150 --> 05:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
receive calls to our information
 
05:13:21.990 --> 05:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
resource line
 
05:13:24.868 --> 05:13:24.878 align:start position:0%
from families who have a loved one
 
05:13:26.310 --> 05:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
with a mental illness who has been
 
05:13:28.628 --> 05:13:28.638 align:start position:0%
arrested and is being held in the county
 
05:13:28.638 --> 05:13:29.830 align:start position:0%
arrested and is being held in the county
jail

05:13:29.830 --> 05:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
jail
 
05:13:31.670 --> 05:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
too often with no treatment and
 
05:13:33.030 --> 05:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
frequently awaiting a bed at new
 
05:13:34.868 --> 05:13:34.878 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital
 
05:13:36.868 --> 05:13:36.878 align:start position:0%
far too often we receive calls from
 
05:13:38.470 --> 05:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
family members whose loved one was at a
 
05:13:40.070 --> 05:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
local hospital
 
05:13:41.350 --> 05:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
boarding in the emergency department
 
05:13:42.868 --> 05:13:42.878 align:start position:0%
while waiting for a bed at new hampshire
 
05:13:45.430 --> 05:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
hospital when they became agitated or
 
05:13:45.440 --> 05:13:46.628 align:start position:0%
hospital when they became agitated or
aggressive

05:13:46.628 --> 05:13:46.638 align:start position:0%
aggressive
 
05:13:48.310 --> 05:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
leading to their arrest and what is
 
05:13:50.230 --> 05:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
ultimately the diversion from emergency
 
05:13:51.910 --> 05:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
department and medical treatment for the
 
05:13:54.310 --> 05:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
county house of corrections
 
05:13:56.788 --> 05:13:56.798 align:start position:0%
yesterday there were 56 adults and 22
 
05:13:58.070 --> 05:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
children waiting for an inpatient
 
05:14:00.470 --> 05:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
psychiatric bed here in new hampshire
 
05:14:01.990 --> 05:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
five of those adults were waiting in
 
05:14:04.390 --> 05:14:04.400 align:start position:0%
correctional facilities
 
05:14:06.868 --> 05:14:06.878 align:start position:0%
it should be noted that the day prior on
 
05:14:10.310 --> 05:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
sunday there were 59 adults waiting
 
05:14:11.910 --> 05:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
five of whom were in correctional
 
05:14:11.920 --> 05:14:13.430 align:start position:0%
five of whom were in correctional
facilities

05:14:13.430 --> 05:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
05:14:16.470 --> 05:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
it is a very sad reality that once an
 
05:14:18.390 --> 05:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
individual has landed in a county
 
05:14:20.310 --> 05:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
correctional facility their weight for
 
05:14:21.910 --> 05:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
an inpatient bed and appropriate
 
05:14:23.910 --> 05:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
psychiatric treatment will actually be
 
05:14:25.830 --> 05:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
longer than if they were boarding in the
 
05:14:28.550 --> 05:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
emergency department
 
05:14:30.550 --> 05:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
when we receive calls to our information
 
05:14:32.628 --> 05:14:32.638 align:start position:0%
resource line from folks who are in this
 
05:14:35.510 --> 05:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
situation and have a loved one who has
 
05:14:37.110 --> 05:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
been arrested
 
05:14:39.990 --> 05:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
we hold our breath frankly after asking
 
05:14:40.000 --> 05:14:40.788 align:start position:0%
we hold our breath frankly after asking
where

05:14:40.788 --> 05:14:40.798 align:start position:0%
where
 
05:14:42.550 --> 05:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
that person was arrested hoping that it
 
05:14:44.230 --> 05:14:44.240 align:start position:0%
will be in a jurisdiction where mental
 
05:14:46.550 --> 05:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
health court is an option
 
05:14:48.230 --> 05:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
it is frankly heartbreaking when we have
 
05:14:50.310 --> 05:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
to tell a family that there is no mental
 
05:14:51.830 --> 05:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
health court in that area that their
 
05:14:53.270 --> 05:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
loved one will not even have the
 
05:14:55.430 --> 05:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be evaluated as to their
 
05:14:57.030 --> 05:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
appropriateness for an alternative
 
05:14:59.350 --> 05:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
sentencing program
 
05:15:01.270 --> 05:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
a program that could provide them with
 
05:15:03.350 --> 05:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
treatment and supervision working to
 
05:15:05.030 --> 05:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
build a full life in their community and
 
05:15:08.070 --> 05:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
avoiding incarceration
 
05:15:10.310 --> 05:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
the commission also found that
 
05:15:11.910 --> 05:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
data and analysis amongst new
 
05:15:13.750 --> 05:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire's mental health courts vary
 
05:15:15.270 --> 05:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
significantly from one court to the
 
05:15:15.280 --> 05:15:16.628 align:start position:0%
significantly from one court to the

other
 
05:15:18.470 --> 05:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
but there are is data out there that
 
05:15:20.070 --> 05:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
demonstrates the impact of these

connections mental health court has
 
05:15:27.750 --> 05:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
demonstrated significant cost savings
 
05:15:29.750 --> 05:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
with a total of over hundred and fifty
 
05:15:31.590 --> 05:15:31.600 align:start position:0%

05:15:34.708 --> 05:15:34.718 align:start position:0%
in 2018 alone
 
05:15:36.310 --> 05:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
now the community connections project is
 
05:15:38.470 --> 05:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
a robust one it was developed and is
 
05:15:40.470 --> 05:15:40.480 align:start position:0%

sort of wrap up the testimony that would
 
05:16:04.708 --> 05:16:04.718 align:start position:0%
be appreciated absolutely
 
05:16:06.150 --> 05:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
in developing its report and
 
05:16:07.590 --> 05:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
recommendations the commission
 
05:16:09.030 --> 05:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
recognized early on the need to

implement statewide standards mental
 
05:16:13.030 --> 05:16:13.040 align:start position:0%

existence
 
05:16:17.750 --> 05:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
and help lay the foundation for the
 
05:16:19.350 --> 05:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
development of a full complement of
 
05:16:21.510 --> 05:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
mental health courts statewide it's a
 
05:16:23.750 --> 05:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
critical first step in creating equal
 
05:16:25.910 --> 05:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
access for justice involved grant that
 
05:16:28.550 --> 05:16:28.560 align:start position:0%

improve outcomes
 
05:16:36.788 --> 05:16:36.798 align:start position:0%

to help their loved ones navigate these

recidivism rate of 14 percent
 
05:19:05.430 --> 05:19:05.440 align:start position:0%

alternative sentencing but i can tell

all willfully participate in mental

health court uh it's a fantastic program
 
05:24:42.868 --> 05:24:42.878 align:start position:0%
and as stated the recidivism rates are
 
05:24:45.030 --> 05:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
um incredibly low
 
05:24:47.510 --> 05:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
um which is one of the bigger factors as
 
05:24:49.190 --> 05:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
far as a law enforcement perspective we
 
05:24:51.510 --> 05:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
don't want to see repeat offenders
 
05:24:54.390 --> 05:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
and we want them to regain a path to
 
05:24:57.030 --> 05:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
wellness as well as citizenship
 
05:24:58.708 --> 05:24:58.718 align:start position:0%
um being part of
 
05:25:01.830 --> 05:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
g j smith i don't want to interrupt but
 
05:25:04.948 --> 05:25:04.958 align:start position:0%
i don't think anybody is contesting
 
05:25:07.270 --> 05:25:07.280 align:start position:0%
the value of the mental health court i
 
05:25:09.350 --> 05:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
think the issue with this particular
 
05:25:09.360 --> 05:25:10.628 align:start position:0%
think the issue with this particular
bill

05:25:10.628 --> 05:25:10.638 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:25:13.990 --> 05:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
is whether or not there we should direct
 
05:25:14.000 --> 05:25:15.270 align:start position:0%
is whether or not there we should direct
the

05:25:15.270 --> 05:25:15.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:25:17.670 --> 05:25:17.680 align:start position:0%
chief justice of the supreme court to
 
05:25:19.590 --> 05:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
come up with standards for a mental
 
05:25:21.670 --> 05:25:21.680 align:start position:0%
health court and so
 
05:25:23.510 --> 05:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
if you could
 
05:25:25.270 --> 05:25:25.280 align:start position:0%
and i think it would be better if
 
05:25:27.110 --> 05:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
everybody directed their testimony
 
05:25:27.120 --> 05:25:28.628 align:start position:0%
everybody directed their testimony
toward

05:25:28.628 --> 05:25:28.638 align:start position:0%
toward
 
05:25:30.150 --> 05:25:30.160 align:start position:0%
why do we need
 
05:25:32.550 --> 05:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
standards as opposed to whether or not
 
05:25:34.470 --> 05:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
there's value to the mental health court
 
05:25:36.708 --> 05:25:36.718 align:start position:0%
because i think we all agree there is
 
05:25:38.788 --> 05:25:38.798 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that representative gordon
 
05:25:40.470 --> 05:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
and that's exactly why i want to speak
 
05:25:40.480 --> 05:25:41.430 align:start position:0%
and that's exactly why i want to speak
today

05:25:41.430 --> 05:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:25:44.830 --> 05:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
um i had the uh
 
05:25:47.990 --> 05:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
the positive experience of meeting with
 
05:25:49.350 --> 05:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
chief justice
 
05:25:51.910 --> 05:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh both superior court and supreme court
 
05:25:53.990 --> 05:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
as well as the administrative judge
 
05:25:55.110 --> 05:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
for um
 
05:25:56.470 --> 05:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
circuit courts
 
05:25:59.830 --> 05:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
and my overall overall feeling
 
05:26:01.350 --> 05:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
during the meeting was yes they were
 
05:26:03.830 --> 05:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
accepted accepting mental health courts
 
05:26:05.270 --> 05:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
but they felt that
 
05:26:06.708 --> 05:26:06.718 align:start position:0%
uh it
 
05:26:08.788 --> 05:26:08.798 align:start position:0%
there really wasn't a planned structure
 
05:26:11.430 --> 05:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
for it in fact what i heard in our
 
05:26:13.350 --> 05:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
meeting was is that he expected some
 
05:26:16.230 --> 05:26:16.240 align:start position:0%
judges to volunteer time sometimes
 
05:26:17.670 --> 05:26:17.680 align:start position:0%
during lunch
 
05:26:17.680 --> 05:26:18.550 align:start position:0%
during lunch
to

05:26:18.550 --> 05:26:18.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:26:20.070 --> 05:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
provide mental health court to the
 
05:26:22.470 --> 05:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
participants there is no structure to
 
05:26:24.070 --> 05:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
the program and i think that's one of
 
05:26:26.150 --> 05:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
its biggest flaws
 
05:26:27.590 --> 05:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
everybody has
 
05:26:29.430 --> 05:26:29.440 align:start position:0%
worked very hard to make what we have
 
05:26:29.440 --> 05:26:30.310 align:start position:0%
worked very hard to make what we have
happen

05:26:30.310 --> 05:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
happen
 
05:26:32.948 --> 05:26:32.958 align:start position:0%
but uh you know our my feeling in
 
05:26:35.190 --> 05:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
grafton county is that if a clerk
 
05:26:37.750 --> 05:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to um assist with the
 
05:26:39.510 --> 05:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
program they simply don't allow us
 
05:26:41.670 --> 05:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
access to the judge and there needs to
 
05:26:44.390 --> 05:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
be structure and that's why i'm in
 
05:26:46.708 --> 05:26:46.718 align:start position:0%
support of this bill and i appreciate
 
05:26:48.868 --> 05:26:48.878 align:start position:0%
you getting right to the point the lack
 
05:26:51.350 --> 05:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
of structure is preventing people from
 
05:26:54.230 --> 05:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
accessing this program and preventing
 
05:26:56.390 --> 05:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
its complete success throughout the
 
05:26:59.030 --> 05:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
state for the citizens
 
05:27:00.390 --> 05:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
and if i could just follow up on that
 
05:27:01.990 --> 05:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
that mental health court is being done
 
05:27:04.070 --> 05:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
in the circuit court is that right
 
05:27:05.510 --> 05:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
that is correct
 
05:27:05.520 --> 05:27:06.470 align:start position:0%
that is correct
um

05:27:06.470 --> 05:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:08.708 --> 05:27:08.718 align:start position:0%
and just to follow up with that it's
 
05:27:11.590 --> 05:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
focusing on individuals that are uh
 
05:27:13.830 --> 05:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
their primary um
 
05:27:16.150 --> 05:27:16.160 align:start position:0%
reason they're in that court is uh for
 
05:27:18.948 --> 05:27:18.958 align:start position:0%
the mental health portion of it um which
 
05:27:21.270 --> 05:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
is driving their criminal behavior uh
 
05:27:23.350 --> 05:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
yes we have drug courts in in superior
 
05:27:23.360 --> 05:27:24.628 align:start position:0%
yes we have drug courts in in superior
court

05:27:24.628 --> 05:27:24.638 align:start position:0%
court
 
05:27:24.638 --> 05:27:25.510 align:start position:0%
court
which

05:27:25.510 --> 05:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
which
 
05:27:28.310 --> 05:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
the drug uses is driving that that
 
05:27:30.708 --> 05:27:30.718 align:start position:0%
particular criminal behavior we do not
 
05:27:32.548 --> 05:27:32.558 align:start position:0%
have mental health courts in superior
 
05:27:34.948 --> 05:27:34.958 align:start position:0%
court which is another big issue and it
 
05:27:37.270 --> 05:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
causes a huge kerfuffle when
 
05:27:38.948 --> 05:27:38.958 align:start position:0%
we have somebody who wants to play in a
 
05:27:40.788 --> 05:27:40.798 align:start position:0%
mental health court and superior court
 
05:27:43.030 --> 05:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
level we just can't take them there's no
 
05:27:43.040 --> 05:27:44.628 align:start position:0%
level we just can't take them there's no
mechanism

05:27:44.628 --> 05:27:44.638 align:start position:0%
mechanism
 
05:27:51.110 --> 05:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:54.628 --> 05:27:54.638 align:start position:0%
and and that uh if i could just follow
 
05:27:57.510 --> 05:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
up on that and that's part of what would
 
05:28:00.230 --> 05:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
happen if you set standards
 
05:28:03.110 --> 05:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
that would allow for that to happen
 
05:28:04.708 --> 05:28:04.718 align:start position:0%
because right now the drug courts are in
 
05:28:06.230 --> 05:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
the superior court the mental health
 
05:28:08.628 --> 05:28:08.638 align:start position:0%
courts are in the circuit courts
 
05:28:11.270 --> 05:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely sir uh yeah and there's two
 
05:28:14.310 --> 05:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
different criteria for getting into them
 
05:28:16.150 --> 05:28:16.160 align:start position:0%
there's uh different criteria for
 
05:28:18.150 --> 05:28:18.160 align:start position:0%
getting into them and currently
 
05:28:19.670 --> 05:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
i would say that all the mental health
 
05:28:21.350 --> 05:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
courts in the state uh have different
 
05:28:23.590 --> 05:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
criteria although they do have a
 
05:28:26.628 --> 05:28:26.638 align:start position:0%
central focus uh each individual one has
 
05:28:30.470 --> 05:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:32.470 --> 05:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for chief
 
05:28:32.480 --> 05:28:36.150 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for chief
smith

05:28:36.150 --> 05:28:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:38.230 --> 05:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for testifying today
 
05:28:42.150 --> 05:28:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:57.030 --> 05:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:58.470 --> 05:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman and honorable
 
05:29:01.190 --> 05:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
05:29:02.788 --> 05:29:02.798 align:start position:0%
my name is bob oxley i'm the director of
 
05:29:04.310 --> 05:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
field services for the department of
 
05:29:04.320 --> 05:29:05.510 align:start position:0%
field services for the department of
corrections

05:29:05.510 --> 05:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
corrections
 
05:29:07.270 --> 05:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
i'll be briefed with my comments uh this
 
05:29:09.110 --> 05:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
afternoon as i've submitted written
 
05:29:11.030 --> 05:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
testimony but wanted to emphasize a few
 
05:29:12.788 --> 05:29:12.798 align:start position:0%
key points
 
05:29:14.628 --> 05:29:14.638 align:start position:0%
department of corrections
 
05:29:16.470 --> 05:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
considers this bill a wise investment
 
05:29:18.628 --> 05:29:18.638 align:start position:0%
for the mental health community however
 
05:29:20.390 --> 05:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
it would have to be an investment
 
05:29:22.070 --> 05:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
if the mental health courts were to be
 
05:29:23.350 --> 05:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
structured in the same way as the
 
05:29:25.350 --> 05:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
current drug courts
 
05:29:26.788 --> 05:29:26.798 align:start position:0%
this would have an impact on field
 
05:29:28.830 --> 05:29:28.840 align:start position:0%
services without the improper
 
05:29:31.030 --> 05:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
investment as mentioned in my written
 
05:29:31.040 --> 05:29:32.470 align:start position:0%
investment as mentioned in my written
testimony

05:29:32.470 --> 05:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
05:29:35.030 --> 05:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
these cases are very time consuming
 
05:29:37.270 --> 05:29:37.280 align:start position:0%
and with proper funding we could meet
 
05:29:38.708 --> 05:29:38.718 align:start position:0%
these goals
 
05:29:40.470 --> 05:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
we would support this bill and would ask
 
05:29:42.070 --> 05:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
we are involved in the process and
 
05:29:45.270 --> 05:29:45.280 align:start position:0%
funded properly to be effective partners
 
05:29:47.430 --> 05:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
with the proper investment
 
05:29:49.350 --> 05:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
set standards would be a viable system
 
05:29:51.190 --> 05:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
for the mental health community and the
 
05:29:53.030 --> 05:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
division of field services could provide
 
05:29:55.110 --> 05:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
the necessary work hours to make this as
 
05:29:59.350 --> 05:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:00.708 --> 05:30:00.718 align:start position:0%

hampshire psychiatric society as well as
 
05:30:36.868 --> 05:30:36.878 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire medical society so
 
05:30:39.350 --> 05:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and honorable members
 
05:30:41.190 --> 05:30:41.200 align:start position:0%
of the committee for allowing me to
 
05:30:43.190 --> 05:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
speak today i had planned to cede most
 
05:30:46.390 --> 05:30:46.400 align:start position:0%
of my time to um to jake barry on this
 
05:30:48.150 --> 05:30:48.160 align:start position:0%
matter but do just want to make the
 
05:30:50.868 --> 05:30:50.878 align:start position:0%
point that um of course the
 
05:30:54.310 --> 05:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
incarceration is no substitute for
 
05:30:55.590 --> 05:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
proper mental
 
05:30:58.230 --> 05:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
health services and so i think that this
 
05:30:58.240 --> 05:30:59.430 align:start position:0%
health services and so i think that this
bill

05:30:59.430 --> 05:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:31:01.590 --> 05:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
is such an important bill for us to
 
05:31:04.310 --> 05:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
consider and vote opt to pass
 
05:31:06.868 --> 05:31:06.878 align:start position:0%
and as far as standards then i think
 
05:31:08.948 --> 05:31:08.958 align:start position:0%
those would be very important for the
 
05:31:12.548 --> 05:31:12.558 align:start position:0%
judiciary system to um to set because
 
05:31:15.590 --> 05:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
having standards would allow us to
 
05:31:17.910 --> 05:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
deliver deliver these services and
 
05:31:19.830 --> 05:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
mental health courts um more
 
05:31:22.070 --> 05:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
expeditiously and more efficiently and
 
05:31:24.788 --> 05:31:24.798 align:start position:0%
allow us to reach more of those in need
 
05:31:24.798 --> 05:31:25.510 align:start position:0%
allow us to reach more of those in need
so

05:31:25.510 --> 05:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:31:27.190 --> 05:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
i wanted to make myself available for
 
05:31:29.350 --> 05:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
questions but did want to see most of my
 
05:31:31.910 --> 05:31:31.920 align:start position:0%

and

05:33:05.830 --> 05:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:09.590 --> 05:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
we need to validate this system and have
 
05:33:13.670 --> 05:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
it organized and efficiently delivered
 
05:33:13.680 --> 05:33:14.548 align:start position:0%

i'm also
 
05:34:14.070 --> 05:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
have helped to set up the first veterans
 
05:34:16.150 --> 05:34:16.160 align:start position:0%
behavioral health track and was invited
 
05:34:19.190 --> 05:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
to capitol hill on behalf of senator
 
05:34:20.788 --> 05:34:20.798 align:start position:0%
shaheen to talk about what we've been
 
05:34:22.788 --> 05:34:22.798 align:start position:0%
doing in new hampshire so just to give
 
05:34:25.430 --> 05:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
you some context about um you know my
 
05:34:27.590 --> 05:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
expertise and as i give a point of
 
05:34:30.470 --> 05:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
reference relative to the standards
 
05:34:32.470 --> 05:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
um first and foremost i would highly
 
05:34:34.708 --> 05:34:34.718 align:start position:0%
recommend that an advisory board be
 
05:34:36.788 --> 05:34:36.798 align:start position:0%
established to conduct a thorough review
 
05:34:38.390 --> 05:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
of each mental health court program in
 
05:34:39.990 --> 05:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire to understand the
 
05:34:40.000 --> 05:34:41.350 align:start position:0%
new hampshire to understand the
landscape

05:34:41.350 --> 05:34:41.360 align:start position:0%
landscape
 
05:34:43.670 --> 05:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
the advisory board if enacted should be
 
05:34:46.390 --> 05:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
comprised of key stakeholders
 
05:34:48.470 --> 05:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
of experts with an understanding of the
 
05:34:50.470 --> 05:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
10 essential elements of a mental health
 
05:34:52.708 --> 05:34:52.718 align:start position:0%
court framework and the sequential
 
05:34:54.310 --> 05:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
intercept model
 
05:34:56.070 --> 05:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
i would caution that any independent
 
05:34:58.390 --> 05:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
research or consultation by national
 
05:35:00.150 --> 05:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
experts and proposing mental health
 
05:35:02.470 --> 05:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
court standards be considered as part of
 
05:35:05.030 --> 05:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
a final review and not the primary means
 
05:35:07.590 --> 05:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
of establishing standards
 
05:35:09.910 --> 05:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
and the purpose for this um
 
05:35:12.470 --> 05:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
this theory is um to establish buy-in
 
05:35:14.708 --> 05:35:14.718 align:start position:0%
from those key stakeholders ensure that
 
05:35:16.708 --> 05:35:16.718 align:start position:0%
there's integrity there to the process
 
05:35:18.628 --> 05:35:18.638 align:start position:0%
and this transparency
 
05:35:20.470 --> 05:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
and what i've seen in these cases is
 
05:35:22.628 --> 05:35:22.638 align:start position:0%
that when there's not transparency
 
05:35:24.470 --> 05:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
within the process and the stakeholders
 
05:35:26.868 --> 05:35:26.878 align:start position:0%
are engaged what it what the outcome is
 
05:35:28.470 --> 05:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
is limited access
 
05:35:30.390 --> 05:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
and in this situation the unintended
 
05:35:32.150 --> 05:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
outcomes are shown from defendants who
 
05:35:33.910 --> 05:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
are over sentenced to mental health
 
05:35:35.830 --> 05:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
court where otherwise a least
 
05:35:38.470 --> 05:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
restrictive sentence would be imposed or
 
05:35:40.708 --> 05:35:40.718 align:start position:0%
the intended target population of
 
05:35:42.628 --> 05:35:42.638 align:start position:0%
at-risk individuals are screened out
 
05:35:45.030 --> 05:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
from participation and this negatively
 
05:35:46.628 --> 05:35:46.638 align:start position:0%
impacts recidivism
 
05:35:48.708 --> 05:35:48.718 align:start position:0%
outcomes and can jeopardize public
 
05:35:48.718 --> 05:35:50.470 align:start position:0%
outcomes and can jeopardize public
safety

05:35:50.470 --> 05:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
safety
 
05:35:52.548 --> 05:35:52.558 align:start position:0%
you need reliable and meaningful data to
 
05:35:55.110 --> 05:35:55.120 align:start position:0%
effectively run a program over the past
 
05:35:57.270 --> 05:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
year i'm to serve as the co-facilitator
 
05:35:58.868 --> 05:35:58.878 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire justice involved
 
05:36:01.510 --> 05:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
veterans task force and i've worked to
 
05:36:03.430 --> 05:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
support veteran behavioral health tracks
 
05:36:05.110 --> 05:36:05.120 align:start position:0%
with the task force by forging
 
05:36:07.750 --> 05:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
partnerships with key stakeholders
 
05:36:10.150 --> 05:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
to collect uniform data metrics for
 
05:36:13.270 --> 05:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
analytics data analytics is critical to
 
05:36:15.190 --> 05:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
the evaluation of any program or
 
05:36:15.200 --> 05:36:16.470 align:start position:0%
the evaluation of any program or
organization

05:36:16.470 --> 05:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
organization
 
05:36:18.390 --> 05:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
and if the advisory board were to be
 
05:36:20.150 --> 05:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
established having data on the mental
 
05:36:22.070 --> 05:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
health court programs would be crucial
 
05:36:24.070 --> 05:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
to assessing the landscapes and lend
 
05:36:26.548 --> 05:36:26.558 align:start position:0%
information about establishing statewide
 
05:36:29.510 --> 05:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
standards for mental health courts
 
05:36:31.670 --> 05:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
so you wouldn't implement a project
 
05:36:33.910 --> 05:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
without a project lead
 
05:36:36.070 --> 05:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
so i'm coming from business model and
 
05:36:38.708 --> 05:36:38.718 align:start position:0%
also from a provider model
 
05:36:40.708 --> 05:36:40.718 align:start position:0%
so we're having a statewide coordinator
 
05:36:42.390 --> 05:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
of mental health courts that can be
 
05:36:44.310 --> 05:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
shared to support not only the mental
 
05:36:46.150 --> 05:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
health courts but the track that's off
 
05:36:48.070 --> 05:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
of that which is supporting our justice
 
05:36:50.070 --> 05:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
involved veterans through our veterans
 
05:36:52.708 --> 05:36:52.718 align:start position:0%
behavioral health track is essential
 
05:36:54.948 --> 05:36:54.958 align:start position:0%
new hampshire needs a strategic plan not
 
05:36:56.788 --> 05:36:56.798 align:start position:0%
just standards a plan and i thank you
 
05:36:58.230 --> 05:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
for your efforts in advancing this
 
05:36:58.240 --> 05:37:00.150 align:start position:0%
for your efforts in advancing this
conversation

05:37:00.150 --> 05:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
05:37:02.788 --> 05:37:02.798 align:start position:0%
this is necessary to enhance the current
 
05:37:05.350 --> 05:37:05.360 align:start position:0%
existing programs and also to expand
 
05:37:07.110 --> 05:37:07.120 align:start position:0%
your to jurisdictions without these
 
05:37:07.120 --> 05:37:08.390 align:start position:0%
your to jurisdictions without these
programs

05:37:08.390 --> 05:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
programs
 
05:37:10.708 --> 05:37:10.718 align:start position:0%
absent this leadership
 
05:37:13.430 --> 05:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
um this is the standards were likely if
 
05:37:15.830 --> 05:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
imposed um could be risk at being
 
05:37:19.190 --> 05:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
diluted and access to programming can be
 
05:37:19.200 --> 05:37:20.548 align:start position:0%
diluted and access to programming can be
impacted

05:37:20.548 --> 05:37:20.558 align:start position:0%
impacted
 
05:37:22.470 --> 05:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
a statewide coordinator can provide the
 
05:37:24.548 --> 05:37:24.558 align:start position:0%
technical assistance provide ongoing
 
05:37:25.910 --> 05:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
assessment of mental health court
 
05:37:28.070 --> 05:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
programs and veteran track programs as
 
05:37:30.390 --> 05:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
well coordinate trainings for the
 
05:37:31.830 --> 05:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
ever-changing court and program
 
05:37:31.840 --> 05:37:33.110 align:start position:0%
ever-changing court and program
personnel

05:37:33.110 --> 05:37:33.120 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
05:37:35.110 --> 05:37:35.120 align:start position:0%
ensure equal access to mental health
 
05:37:37.430 --> 05:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
court programs and be responsible for
 
05:37:39.670 --> 05:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
statewide data analytics if we're going
 
05:37:41.270 --> 05:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
to drive programs then we should be
 
05:37:44.070 --> 05:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
responsible to share the data behind it
 
05:37:45.910 --> 05:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
if you could just if you could just wrap
 
05:37:48.628 --> 05:37:48.638 align:start position:0%
up your testimony
 
05:37:50.070 --> 05:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
i've been at the helm of supporting the
 
05:37:52.230 --> 05:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
sustainability of both the mental health
 
05:37:53.830 --> 05:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
courts in the new hana new hampshire
 
05:37:55.750 --> 05:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
veteran behavioral health tracks i will
 
05:37:58.310 --> 05:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
submit my testimony in writing and i
 
05:38:00.070 --> 05:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
urge you to read the testimony in
 
05:38:01.830 --> 05:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
addition to judge leary
 
05:38:04.150 --> 05:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
with our leadership and expertise of how
 
05:38:06.230 --> 05:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
to advance this conversation and
 
05:38:08.070 --> 05:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
initiatives forwards thank you very much
 
05:38:11.990 --> 05:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:13.590 --> 05:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
if i could just follow up on your
 
05:38:15.590 --> 05:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
testimony you mentioned that there
 
05:38:18.310 --> 05:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
needed to be a statewide coordinator and
 
05:38:20.150 --> 05:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
i think there is a statewide coordinator
 
05:38:22.230 --> 05:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
for the drug courts but not for the
 
05:38:24.470 --> 05:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
mental health courts
 
05:38:24.480 --> 05:38:25.270 align:start position:0%
mental health courts
if

05:38:25.270 --> 05:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:38:27.030 --> 05:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
if there needs to be a statewide and
 
05:38:28.548 --> 05:38:28.558 align:start position:0%
you're looking at an advisory board are
 
05:38:31.030 --> 05:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
you suggesting that we amend this bill
 
05:38:33.110 --> 05:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
to do that or is that something that you
 
05:38:34.948 --> 05:38:34.958 align:start position:0%
contemplate would be done
 
05:38:38.070 --> 05:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
if we direct the chief justice to
 
05:38:40.788 --> 05:38:40.798 align:start position:0%
adopt standards
 
05:38:42.708 --> 05:38:42.718 align:start position:0%
um thank you for thank you for the
 
05:38:46.230 --> 05:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
question and i i think that they're
 
05:38:48.070 --> 05:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
if in reviewing of judge leary's
 
05:38:50.070 --> 05:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
testimony and i know he submitted
 
05:38:52.150 --> 05:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
written testimony i mean in the
 
05:38:53.990 --> 05:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
testimony that i have today
 
05:38:56.788 --> 05:38:56.798 align:start position:0%
i i would recommend that the the bill be
 
05:39:00.470 --> 05:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
amended to ensure that there is uh
 
05:39:02.548 --> 05:39:02.558 align:start position:0%
a process by which the standards are
 
05:39:02.558 --> 05:39:03.830 align:start position:0%
a process by which the standards are
developed

05:39:03.830 --> 05:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
developed
 
05:39:07.350 --> 05:39:07.360 align:start position:0%
given some of the expertise that was
 
05:39:09.350 --> 05:39:09.360 align:start position:0%
shared both in the written testimony my
 
05:39:12.230 --> 05:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
testimony today
 
05:39:14.708 --> 05:39:14.718 align:start position:0%
i guess if i had one more question
 
05:39:16.310 --> 05:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
and you know i'm well aware that judge
 
05:39:18.708 --> 05:39:18.718 align:start position:0%
leary has a wonderful reputation for
 
05:39:20.310 --> 05:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
running the mental health court down in
 
05:39:20.320 --> 05:39:21.670 align:start position:0%
running the mental health court down in
nashua

05:39:21.670 --> 05:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
nashua
 
05:39:21.680 --> 05:39:23.350 align:start position:0%
nashua
but

05:39:23.350 --> 05:39:23.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:39:25.910 --> 05:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
has he made any efforts
 
05:39:29.110 --> 05:39:29.120 align:start position:0%
through judge king to already do this on
 
05:39:31.190 --> 05:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
a circuit court basis
 
05:39:33.990 --> 05:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
without necessarily having to get the
 
05:39:36.390 --> 05:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
supreme court involved
 
05:39:38.628 --> 05:39:38.638 align:start position:0%
so there's been a lot of conversations
 
05:39:41.830 --> 05:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
um and great initiatives but we need
 
05:39:44.628 --> 05:39:44.638 align:start position:0%
coordination to drive these you know
 
05:39:47.910 --> 05:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
changes um suggested or proposed changes
 
05:39:49.990 --> 05:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
and and and that's where i come in
 
05:39:51.430 --> 05:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
through the veterans behavioral health
 
05:39:54.470 --> 05:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
track i can share that we have national
 
05:39:56.150 --> 05:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
justice for um
 
05:39:58.390 --> 05:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
a national organization that already we
 
05:39:59.910 --> 05:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
don't need to recreate the wheel this
 
05:40:01.670 --> 05:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
has already been established
 
05:40:04.150 --> 05:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
my efforts because there's no statewide
 
05:40:06.548 --> 05:40:06.558 align:start position:0%
coordination are not successful it's
 
05:40:08.948 --> 05:40:08.958 align:start position:0%
taking an exorbitant amount of time so
 
05:40:10.230 --> 05:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
it's not just
 
05:40:12.390 --> 05:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
establishing the standards or the the
 
05:40:14.310 --> 05:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
procedure it's about somebody that
 
05:40:16.470 --> 05:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
drives it having somebody responsible
 
05:40:18.390 --> 05:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
that oversees and and
 
05:40:20.788 --> 05:40:20.798 align:start position:0%
and helps execute the project plan
 
05:40:20.798 --> 05:40:24.230 align:start position:0%
and helps execute the project plan
essentially

05:40:24.230 --> 05:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:26.788 --> 05:40:26.798 align:start position:0%
the questions
 
05:40:30.390 --> 05:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:37.910 --> 05:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:39.430 --> 05:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
representative langley you're muted i
 
05:40:39.440 --> 05:40:41.990 align:start position:0%
representative langley you're muted i
think

05:40:41.990 --> 05:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
think
 
05:40:44.470 --> 05:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
apologize thank you for letting me know
 
05:40:47.750 --> 05:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
miss o'neill i thought when i when
 
05:40:50.070 --> 05:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
um this bill was first presented i was
 
05:40:51.430 --> 05:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
very clear
 
05:40:53.590 --> 05:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
and i guess the longer our discussion
 
05:40:57.430 --> 05:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
goes the murkier it is getting for me
 
05:41:00.150 --> 05:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
i'm not understanding why
 
05:41:01.430 --> 05:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
the system
 
05:41:03.750 --> 05:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh both the judicial the mental health
 
05:41:06.230 --> 05:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
and medical have not collaborated
 
05:41:08.310 --> 05:41:08.320 align:start position:0%
together and and
 
05:41:10.868 --> 05:41:10.878 align:start position:0%
developed the standards taking on their
 
05:41:13.190 --> 05:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
own initiative at this point
 
05:41:15.670 --> 05:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
can you help me realize why that hasn't
 
05:41:15.680 --> 05:41:16.788 align:start position:0%
can you help me realize why that hasn't
happened

05:41:16.788 --> 05:41:16.798 align:start position:0%
happened
 
05:41:19.190 --> 05:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative langley um so i
 
05:41:21.110 --> 05:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
i think that uh there has been a lot of
 
05:41:23.190 --> 05:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
collaboration but that exists within
 
05:41:26.548 --> 05:41:26.558 align:start position:0%
each individual jurisdiction and um so i
 
05:41:28.708 --> 05:41:28.718 align:start position:0%
know that there's statewide coordination
 
05:41:30.708 --> 05:41:30.718 align:start position:0%
through alex casill the statewide drug
 
05:41:32.628 --> 05:41:32.638 align:start position:0%
court coordinator and also the mental
 
05:41:35.030 --> 05:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
health court liaisons but who's the
 
05:41:37.030 --> 05:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
responsible party
 
05:41:39.030 --> 05:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
who's responsible to set that up and
 
05:41:40.708 --> 05:41:40.718 align:start position:0%
that leads me back to why it's
 
05:41:42.868 --> 05:41:42.878 align:start position:0%
imperative that we establish a statewide
 
05:41:42.878 --> 05:41:46.070 align:start position:0%
imperative that we establish a statewide
coordinator

05:41:46.070 --> 05:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:49.510 --> 05:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up mr chair certainly
 
05:41:49.520 --> 05:41:50.390 align:start position:0%
follow-up mr chair certainly
so

05:41:50.390 --> 05:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:41:52.788 --> 05:41:52.798 align:start position:0%
really what you're talking about is the
 
05:41:54.948 --> 05:41:54.958 align:start position:0%
leadership of the project as well as the
 
05:41:57.910 --> 05:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
authority to really uh set the
 
05:41:57.920 --> 05:41:59.750 align:start position:0%
authority to really uh set the
implementation

05:41:59.750 --> 05:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
implementation
 
05:42:02.230 --> 05:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
within multiple agencies
 
05:42:04.948 --> 05:42:04.958 align:start position:0%
that is correct representative langley
 
05:42:07.990 --> 05:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:09.910 --> 05:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
05:42:12.310 --> 05:42:12.320 align:start position:0%
ms o'neill
 
05:42:14.868 --> 05:42:14.878 align:start position:0%
xenon thank you for your testimony today
 
05:42:16.868 --> 05:42:16.878 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:42:23.350 --> 05:42:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:34.070 --> 05:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:35.430 --> 05:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
not sure i see him on the list of
 
05:42:35.440 --> 05:42:38.948 align:start position:0%
not sure i see him on the list of
attendees

05:42:38.948 --> 05:42:38.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:48.310 --> 05:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:51.510 --> 05:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure i see
 
05:43:00.310 --> 05:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:04.548 --> 05:43:04.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:04.558 --> 05:43:06.070 align:start position:0%
 
and

05:43:06.070 --> 05:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:43:07.110 --> 05:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
i see
 
05:43:10.948 --> 05:43:10.958 align:start position:0%
judge nadeau his hand up here
 
05:43:15.830 --> 05:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:17.910 --> 05:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
yes thank you i i was afraid that maybe
 
05:43:19.750 --> 05:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
i hadn't signed up correctly but i i
 
05:43:21.510 --> 05:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
really appreciate the time and the
 
05:43:23.110 --> 05:43:23.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to hear everybody and i will
 
05:43:25.590 --> 05:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
be very brief and focus on your question
 
05:43:27.670 --> 05:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
about standards and i do think it's
 
05:43:30.470 --> 05:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
important to have standards i think that
 
05:43:33.110 --> 05:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
when the legislature funded fully funded
 
05:43:34.708 --> 05:43:34.718 align:start position:0%
drug courts we were able to have the
 
05:43:34.718 --> 05:43:36.150 align:start position:0%
drug courts we were able to have the
resources

05:43:36.150 --> 05:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
resources
 
05:43:36.160 --> 05:43:37.030 align:start position:0%
resources
to

05:43:37.030 --> 05:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:43:38.708 --> 05:43:38.718 align:start position:0%
make sure we were implementing standards
 
05:43:40.230 --> 05:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
there are as i said in the previous
 
05:43:41.830 --> 05:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
hearing national standards for drug
 
05:43:43.590 --> 05:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
courts there aren't any for mental
 
05:43:45.510 --> 05:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
health courts for all kinds of reasons i
 
05:43:45.520 --> 05:43:46.230 align:start position:0%
health courts for all kinds of reasons i
think

05:43:46.230 --> 05:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
think
 
05:43:48.868 --> 05:43:48.878 align:start position:0%
the national folks just didn't want they
 
05:43:50.708 --> 05:43:50.718 align:start position:0%
didn't have the time and and energy to
 
05:43:52.470 --> 05:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
put into another whole set of standards
 
05:43:54.788 --> 05:43:54.798 align:start position:0%
so there are some states that have
 
05:43:56.470 --> 05:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
developed standards that we could take a
 
05:43:57.510 --> 05:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
look at
 
05:43:59.270 --> 05:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
and i do think judge king and i were
 
05:44:01.510 --> 05:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
both on the commission that produced
 
05:44:04.310 --> 05:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
this legislation so he and i are talking
 
05:44:06.708 --> 05:44:06.718 align:start position:0%
together all the time we do have a drug
 
05:44:09.270 --> 05:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
court coordinator and i think having an
 
05:44:12.310 --> 05:44:12.320 align:start position:0%
office that addresses the specialty
 
05:44:14.708 --> 05:44:14.718 align:start position:0%
courts with various participants so
 
05:44:16.548 --> 05:44:16.558 align:start position:0%
they're working together but also having
 
05:44:18.788 --> 05:44:18.798 align:start position:0%
their own specialty make some sense and
 
05:44:20.708 --> 05:44:20.718 align:start position:0%
these standards would be able to address
 
05:44:23.110 --> 05:44:23.120 align:start position:0%
all of those things judge leary has been
 
05:44:24.948 --> 05:44:24.958 align:start position:0%
an incredible leader in the mental
 
05:44:27.350 --> 05:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
health courts and they even though we
 
05:44:28.548 --> 05:44:28.558 align:start position:0%
have drug courts and mental health
 
05:44:31.030 --> 05:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
courts drug courts are designed to deal
 
05:44:32.948 --> 05:44:32.958 align:start position:0%
with co-occurring issues so mental
 
05:44:34.948 --> 05:44:34.958 align:start position:0%
health and treatment but the main
 
05:44:37.030 --> 05:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
problem is substance use mental health
 
05:44:38.788 --> 05:44:38.798 align:start position:0%
courts also deal with co-occurring
 
05:44:40.628 --> 05:44:40.638 align:start position:0%
issues but the main problem is a
 
05:44:42.548 --> 05:44:42.558 align:start position:0%
persistent mental health issue so there
 
05:44:44.868 --> 05:44:44.878 align:start position:0%
is room for both and i think when we
 
05:44:44.878 --> 05:44:45.590 align:start position:0%
is room for both and i think when we
have

05:44:45.590 --> 05:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:44:47.830 --> 05:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
best practice standards to follow then
 
05:44:48.868 --> 05:44:48.878 align:start position:0%
we're going to make sure we have the
 
05:44:54.230 --> 05:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:57.590 --> 05:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:00.628 --> 05:45:00.638 align:start position:0%
i think i had this is sort of a process
 
05:45:00.638 --> 05:45:01.670 align:start position:0%
i think i had this is sort of a process
question

05:45:01.670 --> 05:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:45:03.590 --> 05:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
05:45:05.830 --> 05:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
can the legislature direct the chief
 
05:45:08.070 --> 05:45:08.080 align:start position:0%
justice of the supreme court to do
 
05:45:11.030 --> 05:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
something in being a separate branch of
 
05:45:11.040 --> 05:45:12.548 align:start position:0%
something in being a separate branch of
government

05:45:12.548 --> 05:45:12.558 align:start position:0%
government
 
05:45:12.558 --> 05:45:13.350 align:start position:0%
government
right

05:45:13.350 --> 05:45:13.360 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:45:15.270 --> 05:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
i understand that the
 
05:45:17.750 --> 05:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
circuit court is a creation of the
 
05:45:19.990 --> 05:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
legislature and we
 
05:45:22.868 --> 05:45:22.878 align:start position:0%
have authority to do the design
 
05:45:25.190 --> 05:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
over the circuit court
 
05:45:28.070 --> 05:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
but i guess the question i had was can
 
05:45:30.310 --> 05:45:30.320 align:start position:0%
we direct the chief justice to take some
 
05:45:33.430 --> 05:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:35.030 --> 05:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
wow you really put me on the hot spot
 
05:45:37.990 --> 05:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
right so i i you know i always want to
 
05:45:39.510 --> 05:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
respect the balance between the two
 
05:45:42.070 --> 05:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
branches and work collaboratively
 
05:45:44.948 --> 05:45:44.958 align:start position:0%
and you know when you're talking um
 
05:45:47.430 --> 05:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
straight up can one branch order another
 
05:45:49.830 --> 05:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
branch to do something probably not but
 
05:45:52.150 --> 05:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
we we all want to cooperate in this
 
05:45:54.548 --> 05:45:54.558 align:start position:0%
effort and make sure that we're we're
 
05:45:57.670 --> 05:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
using resources wisely and i think that
 
05:46:00.310 --> 05:46:00.320 align:start position:0%
judge king understands the value i mean
 
05:46:03.110 --> 05:46:03.120 align:start position:0%
he and i spoke before this testimony the
 
05:46:04.628 --> 05:46:04.638 align:start position:0%
value of mental health courts he's
 
05:46:06.470 --> 05:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
gotten some really great judges in the
 
05:46:08.868 --> 05:46:08.878 align:start position:0%
circuit court to be leaders so whatever
 
05:46:11.270 --> 05:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
you decide we are we know that it's
 
05:46:12.470 --> 05:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
important to you to come up with
 
05:46:16.628 --> 05:46:16.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:20.948 --> 05:46:20.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:23.750 --> 05:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:24.948 --> 05:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
see none
 
05:46:27.510 --> 05:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony today
 
05:46:28.708 --> 05:46:28.718 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:46:31.510 --> 05:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
and i see alex cassell is asked to
 
05:46:34.788 --> 05:46:34.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:36.150 --> 05:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
hi can you hear me
 
05:46:38.628 --> 05:46:38.638 align:start position:0%
we can all right thank you um thank you
 
05:46:40.390 --> 05:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
mr chairman and members of the committee
 
05:46:42.070 --> 05:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
i will be very brief i just wanted to
 
05:46:43.830 --> 05:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
touch on a couple points that people had
 
05:46:45.830 --> 05:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
brought up over the course of this
 
05:46:48.548 --> 05:46:48.558 align:start position:0%
hearing uh i'm testifying on behalf of
 
05:46:51.590 --> 05:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
or in support of house bill 578 i am the
 
05:46:54.548 --> 05:46:54.558 align:start position:0%
statewide coordinator um the technical
 
05:46:56.708 --> 05:46:56.718 align:start position:0%
term is the drug offender program
 
05:46:59.110 --> 05:46:59.120 align:start position:0%
coordinator um but essentially i oversee
 
05:47:01.110 --> 05:47:01.120 align:start position:0%
the drug courts so we are currently
 
05:47:02.868 --> 05:47:02.878 align:start position:0%
working on a strategic plan with some
 
05:47:05.350 --> 05:47:05.360 align:start position:0%
federal partners bja has a technical
 
05:47:07.430 --> 05:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
assistance grant that they've given to
 
05:47:09.030 --> 05:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
center for court innovations out of new
 
05:47:11.750 --> 05:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
york um we're currently working on that
 
05:47:13.430 --> 05:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
and mental health court is going to be
 
05:47:15.190 --> 05:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
part of that plan
 
05:47:18.548 --> 05:47:18.558 align:start position:0%
um we also secured a master's level
 
05:47:21.030 --> 05:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
intern from unh who this will be her
 
05:47:24.070 --> 05:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
primary project will to be to do some
 
05:47:26.070 --> 05:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
national research and local research on
 
05:47:27.830 --> 05:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
our mental health courts to help us
 
05:47:30.628 --> 05:47:30.638 align:start position:0%
craft uh potentially statewide standards
 
05:47:33.350 --> 05:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
if this bill is passed
 
05:47:35.270 --> 05:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
and then
 
05:47:37.270 --> 05:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
the the reason for this or that i feel
 
05:47:39.030 --> 05:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
that is very necessary
 
05:47:40.390 --> 05:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
one of the questions you asked earlier
 
05:47:41.750 --> 05:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
with about
 
05:47:43.910 --> 05:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
chiefs to chief smith was
 
05:47:45.670 --> 05:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
um i need to be able to walk into a
 
05:47:47.910 --> 05:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
courtroom and recognize them in a mental
 
05:47:50.310 --> 05:47:50.320 align:start position:0%
health court if we have no standards
 
05:47:52.230 --> 05:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
they can all look very different and
 
05:47:55.510 --> 05:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
we're only going to be judged on
 
05:47:58.230 --> 05:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
the you know the the worst
 
05:48:00.470 --> 05:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
performing mental health court and if
 
05:48:02.788 --> 05:48:02.798 align:start position:0%
they're not following the standards
 
05:48:04.470 --> 05:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
then we can turn to that court and say
 
05:48:05.990 --> 05:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
well you need to follow standards six
 
05:48:07.830 --> 05:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
seven and eight you're not doing that so
 
05:48:09.750 --> 05:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
that's the new that's the basis of the
 
05:48:12.070 --> 05:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
need for standards is to make sure that
 
05:48:14.708 --> 05:48:14.718 align:start position:0%
they're all operating properly and
 
05:48:16.708 --> 05:48:16.718 align:start position:0%
if you walk into any courtroom during a
 
05:48:18.150 --> 05:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
mental health court session you'll
 
05:48:19.830 --> 05:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
recognize where you are
 
05:48:21.590 --> 05:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:48:27.190 --> 05:48:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:32.390 --> 05:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:36.708 --> 05:48:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:40.150 --> 05:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
i i'm not even sure how to ask this
 
05:48:40.160 --> 05:48:41.670 align:start position:0%
i i'm not even sure how to ask this
question

05:48:41.670 --> 05:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:48:41.680 --> 05:48:42.470 align:start position:0%
question
what

05:48:42.470 --> 05:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
what
 
05:48:44.948 --> 05:48:44.958 align:start position:0%
i hear is that
 
05:48:46.868 --> 05:48:46.878 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch
 
05:48:48.948 --> 05:48:48.958 align:start position:0%
cares a lot about many of the same
 
05:48:51.110 --> 05:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
things that many members of the
 
05:48:54.230 --> 05:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
legislature care about
 
05:48:54.240 --> 05:48:55.990 align:start position:0%
legislature care about
um

05:48:55.990 --> 05:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:56.000 --> 05:48:56.868 align:start position:0%
um
but

05:48:56.868 --> 05:48:56.878 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:48:56.878 --> 05:48:57.990 align:start position:0%
but
they

05:48:57.990 --> 05:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:48:59.990 --> 05:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
seem not to have
 
05:49:00.000 --> 05:49:01.270 align:start position:0%
seem not to have
the

05:49:01.270 --> 05:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:49:05.030 --> 05:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
understanding of how to
 
05:49:05.040 --> 05:49:06.708 align:start position:0%
understanding of how to
structure

05:49:06.708 --> 05:49:06.718 align:start position:0%
structure
 
05:49:09.110 --> 05:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
their courts
 
05:49:09.120 --> 05:49:10.948 align:start position:0%
their courts
and

05:49:10.948 --> 05:49:10.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:49:12.230 --> 05:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
we are
 
05:49:16.788 --> 05:49:16.798 align:start position:0%
so regularly resisted and rebuffed
 
05:49:19.510 --> 05:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
when we in the legislature try to make
 
05:49:22.230 --> 05:49:22.240 align:start position:0%
suggestions to the courts
 
05:49:25.350 --> 05:49:25.360 align:start position:0%
about things that we think are important
 
05:49:27.990 --> 05:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
i can't quite understand
 
05:49:28.000 --> 05:49:29.270 align:start position:0%
i can't quite understand
why

05:49:29.270 --> 05:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
why
 
05:49:32.548 --> 05:49:32.558 align:start position:0%
the roles have been reversed and
 
05:49:35.030 --> 05:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
the courts don't seem to find the
 
05:49:37.590 --> 05:49:37.600 align:start position:0%
resources to do this and need us to tell
 
05:49:39.430 --> 05:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
them what to do
 
05:49:42.230 --> 05:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
that's a long question mr chair but it's
 
05:49:47.190 --> 05:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:49.270 --> 05:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your question i think
 
05:49:51.030 --> 05:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
that that question might
 
05:49:54.230 --> 05:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
well be beyond my scope uh to answer if
 
05:49:55.910 --> 05:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
judgmental is still on she may be able
 
05:49:58.708 --> 05:49:58.718 align:start position:0%
to answer that but i i will just say
 
05:50:00.310 --> 05:50:00.320 align:start position:0%
this one thing to to your question
 
05:50:02.470 --> 05:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
hopefully it will help address it which
 
05:50:02.480 --> 05:50:03.350 align:start position:0%
hopefully it will help address it which
is

05:50:03.350 --> 05:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:50:05.590 --> 05:50:05.600 align:start position:0%
i think that the court system in terms
 
05:50:08.230 --> 05:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
of this legislative piece of legislation
 
05:50:09.750 --> 05:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
was was ready
 
05:50:11.430 --> 05:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
to come up with standards we were at
 
05:50:13.830 --> 05:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
that point in in the
 
05:50:16.070 --> 05:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
in the process we created the statewide
 
05:50:18.070 --> 05:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
drug courts um
 
05:50:19.270 --> 05:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
you know on the
 
05:50:21.590 --> 05:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
after the legislation was passed we
 
05:50:23.670 --> 05:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
focused on that and that and now we're
 
05:50:26.230 --> 05:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
looking to move beyond the adult drug
 
05:50:28.390 --> 05:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
courts because we want to also encompass
 
05:50:29.670 --> 05:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
some of our other treatment courts that
 
05:50:31.110 --> 05:50:31.120 align:start position:0%
we have in the state
 
05:50:32.788 --> 05:50:32.798 align:start position:0%
so i don't know if that answers your
 
05:50:35.190 --> 05:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
question but that's i think that's the
 
05:50:37.110 --> 05:50:37.120 align:start position:0%
best i can i can come up with on the
 
05:50:37.120 --> 05:50:38.708 align:start position:0%
best i can i can come up with on the
spot

05:50:38.708 --> 05:50:38.718 align:start position:0%
spot
 
05:50:40.948 --> 05:50:40.958 align:start position:0%
is he judging the vote judge nadeau has
 
05:50:43.190 --> 05:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
her hand up perhaps she would like to
 
05:50:47.990 --> 05:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:49.590 --> 05:50:49.600 align:start position:0%
oh thank you i just want to make sure i
 
05:50:51.270 --> 05:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
offered that in case you wanted to ask
 
05:50:54.310 --> 05:50:54.320 align:start position:0%
me ask me you know was it just in 2016
 
05:50:55.990 --> 05:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
where the legislature
 
05:50:57.670 --> 05:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
believed it was appropriate to fully
 
05:50:59.270 --> 05:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
fund drug courts so that's been about
 
05:51:01.590 --> 05:51:01.600 align:start position:0%
four years we've had one drug court
 
05:51:03.350 --> 05:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
coordinator who's put a ton of effort
 
05:51:05.270 --> 05:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
into making sure we're following
 
05:51:07.430 --> 05:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
standards there we have incredibly
 
05:51:10.070 --> 05:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
amount of dedicated judges and community
 
05:51:12.150 --> 05:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
leaders who are forging ahead with
 
05:51:13.910 --> 05:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
mental health courts even though we
 
05:51:15.910 --> 05:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
didn't really have the resources to do
 
05:51:17.750 --> 05:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
that so those mental health courts are
 
05:51:19.670 --> 05:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
operating well and now we've been able
 
05:51:21.910 --> 05:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
to turn our attention to what can we do
 
05:51:23.750 --> 05:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
to make sure they're operating more
 
05:51:26.310 --> 05:51:26.320 align:start position:0%
consistently and one of the steps is to
 
05:51:27.830 --> 05:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
come up with standards the commission
 
05:51:30.310 --> 05:51:30.320 align:start position:0%
that meant last year started to go down
 
05:51:32.070 --> 05:51:32.080 align:start position:0%
the road of describing what they should
 
05:51:34.070 --> 05:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
all look like and they were very
 
05:51:35.910 --> 05:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
receptive to
 
05:51:37.750 --> 05:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
our suggestion that we come up with
 
05:51:39.510 --> 05:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
standards first and because there are no
 
05:51:40.868 --> 05:51:40.878 align:start position:0%
national standards that made it
 
05:51:45.110 --> 05:51:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:46.708 --> 05:51:46.718 align:start position:0%
and representative smith did you have a
 
05:51:48.470 --> 05:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up question
 
05:51:52.868 --> 05:51:52.878 align:start position:0%
well um i have such admiration
 
05:51:56.150 --> 05:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
for uh judge nedo and for the incredible
 
05:51:58.708 --> 05:51:58.718 align:start position:0%
work that she's done here and work that
 
05:52:00.868 --> 05:52:00.878 align:start position:0%
she's done in other areas i go all the
 
05:52:03.510 --> 05:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
way back to senate bill 500
 
05:52:03.520 --> 05:52:06.150 align:start position:0%
way back to senate bill 500
um

05:52:06.150 --> 05:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:08.230 --> 05:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
i'm just not clear on whether the
 
05:52:10.548 --> 05:52:10.558 align:start position:0%
problem is that the
 
05:52:14.230 --> 05:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
judiciary that the governor has not um
 
05:52:17.190 --> 05:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
identified appropriate funds
 
05:52:19.750 --> 05:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
or that the legislature has not agreed
 
05:52:23.270 --> 05:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
to appropriate funding um
 
05:52:23.280 --> 05:52:24.390 align:start position:0%
to appropriate funding um
or

05:52:24.390 --> 05:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:52:26.868 --> 05:52:26.878 align:start position:0%
and that is and as a result the staff is
 
05:52:26.878 --> 05:52:28.628 align:start position:0%
and that is and as a result the staff is
not

05:52:28.628 --> 05:52:28.638 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:52:31.830 --> 05:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
of the size and experience it should be
 
05:52:34.708 --> 05:52:34.718 align:start position:0%
um i i just am not clear on where the
 
05:52:37.190 --> 05:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
boundaries are and i want to respect the
 
05:52:39.430 --> 05:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
boundaries between the judicial and the
 
05:52:39.440 --> 05:52:41.270 align:start position:0%
boundaries between the judicial and the
legislative

05:52:41.270 --> 05:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
05:52:41.280 --> 05:52:43.430 align:start position:0%
legislative
branches

05:52:43.430 --> 05:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
branches
 
05:52:45.510 --> 05:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
i guess i would say i just don't i don't
 
05:52:47.990 --> 05:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
think there's a problem i think there is
 
05:52:50.628 --> 05:52:50.638 align:start position:0%
concerted effort on all parts to
 
05:52:53.190 --> 05:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
to move forward and recognize that
 
05:52:57.190 --> 05:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:58.708 --> 05:52:58.718 align:start position:0%
if i could just
 
05:53:00.708 --> 05:53:00.718 align:start position:0%
follow up on that
 
05:53:00.718 --> 05:53:02.948 align:start position:0%
follow up on that
and

05:53:02.948 --> 05:53:02.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:53:05.190 --> 05:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
it seems that there was a time in the
 
05:53:07.190 --> 05:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
circuit court where
 
05:53:07.200 --> 05:53:08.230 align:start position:0%
circuit court where
uh

05:53:08.230 --> 05:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:53:11.190 --> 05:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
we opened up the idea that it made lots
 
05:53:13.750 --> 05:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
of sense to have mental health courts
 
05:53:14.708 --> 05:53:14.718 align:start position:0%
and then
 
05:53:16.948 --> 05:53:16.958 align:start position:0%
we sort of went through the recessionary
 
05:53:20.390 --> 05:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
period and began in 2008
 
05:53:23.030 --> 05:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
and it seems like there haven't
 
05:53:26.150 --> 05:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
been enough circuit court judges
 
05:53:28.628 --> 05:53:28.638 align:start position:0%
or they all appear to be
 
05:53:30.470 --> 05:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
the ones that are there
 
05:53:33.110 --> 05:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
seem to be very busy
 
05:53:34.310 --> 05:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
yeah and
 
05:53:36.310 --> 05:53:36.320 align:start position:0%
as a result
 
05:53:39.590 --> 05:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
um even though there is a
 
05:53:41.910 --> 05:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
wonderful intent on the part of lots of
 
05:53:45.190 --> 05:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
people to do more i think many feel that
 
05:53:47.270 --> 05:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
they just don't have the resources or
 
05:53:49.510 --> 05:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
the ability to do more
 
05:53:51.990 --> 05:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
and i guess the question is
 
05:53:55.030 --> 05:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
will creating standards actually
 
05:53:57.270 --> 05:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
provide the resources you need to get
 
05:54:16.230 --> 05:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:18.628 --> 05:54:18.638 align:start position:0%
no you're you're online am i there oh
 
05:54:20.948 --> 05:54:20.958 align:start position:0%
sorry i'm so sorry i'm so not used to
 
05:54:20.958 --> 05:54:21.830 align:start position:0%
sorry i'm so sorry i'm so not used to
this

05:54:21.830 --> 05:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:54:24.548 --> 05:54:24.558 align:start position:0%
no i think you said it absolutely well
 
05:54:24.558 --> 05:54:25.350 align:start position:0%
no i think you said it absolutely well
um

05:54:25.350 --> 05:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:54:27.910 --> 05:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative gordon it it it does
 
05:54:30.470 --> 05:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
take a lot of time to run these courts
 
05:54:32.470 --> 05:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
when we when we got drug courts up and
 
05:54:34.948 --> 05:54:34.958 align:start position:0%
running we figured it was probably a
 
05:54:36.628 --> 05:54:36.638 align:start position:0%
full-time equivalent of a judge and a
 
05:54:38.390 --> 05:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
half but we didn't ask for it because we
 
05:54:40.628 --> 05:54:40.638 align:start position:0%
had already been asking for so much so
 
05:54:42.070 --> 05:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
and then when you talk about all the
 
05:54:44.230 --> 05:54:44.240 align:start position:0%
circuit courts and that's really mostly
 
05:54:45.830 --> 05:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
where these mental health court cases
 
05:54:47.030 --> 05:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
come up
 
05:54:49.110 --> 05:54:49.120 align:start position:0%
they have a hard time fitting into that
 
05:54:51.190 --> 05:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
into their incredibly busy busy docket
 
05:54:53.030 --> 05:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
so there's two things there's standards
 
05:54:54.390 --> 05:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
so we can know what it's going to look
 
05:54:55.990 --> 05:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
like then we'll know what the resource
 
05:54:57.590 --> 05:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
requirement is and then there's the
 
05:54:58.868 --> 05:54:58.878 align:start position:0%
resource issue and that so i think
 
05:55:03.910 --> 05:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:06.150 --> 05:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
05:55:07.990 --> 05:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
05:55:11.110 --> 05:55:11.120 align:start position:0%
again today thank you
 
05:55:12.628 --> 05:55:12.638 align:start position:0%
i did um
 
05:55:14.150 --> 05:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
there was somebody who signed up it was
 
05:55:15.910 --> 05:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
shannon bader
 
05:55:17.430 --> 05:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if she wished to
 
05:55:21.590 --> 05:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:21.600 --> 05:55:27.910 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:55:27.910 --> 05:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:30.868 --> 05:55:30.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:33.430 --> 05:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
can you hear me now we can
 
05:55:35.110 --> 05:55:35.120 align:start position:0%
hi my name is shannon bader i'm a
 
05:55:37.670 --> 05:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
psychologist from beau new hampshire and
 
05:55:39.030 --> 05:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to
 
05:55:40.868 --> 05:55:40.878 align:start position:0%
highlight a couple points i'm a forensic
 
05:55:42.708 --> 05:55:42.718 align:start position:0%
psychologist who's licensed here in new
 
05:55:42.718 --> 05:55:43.830 align:start position:0%
psychologist who's licensed here in new
hampshire

05:55:43.830 --> 05:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:55:45.910 --> 05:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
so i conduct psychological evaluations
 
05:55:48.230 --> 05:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
for all district and superior courts
 
05:55:49.590 --> 05:55:49.600 align:start position:0%
for folks who have mental illness
 
05:55:50.868 --> 05:55:50.878 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
05:55:52.708 --> 05:55:52.718 align:start position:0%
so i've had a front row seat to all the
 
05:55:54.788 --> 05:55:54.798 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions the ones that have mental
 
05:55:57.350 --> 05:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
health court and the ones that do not
 
05:55:59.110 --> 05:55:59.120 align:start position:0%
and in addition to my role as a forensic
 
05:56:00.628 --> 05:56:00.638 align:start position:0%
psychologist i'm also the
 
05:56:02.470 --> 05:56:02.480 align:start position:0%
president-elect of the american academy
 
05:56:04.470 --> 05:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
of forensic psychologists so this has
 
05:56:05.750 --> 05:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
given me a chance to look at the
 
05:56:07.910 --> 05:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
nationwide trends in mental health
 
05:56:10.390 --> 05:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
courts across the country
 
05:56:11.750 --> 05:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
and i wanted to just say a couple things
 
05:56:13.350 --> 05:56:13.360 align:start position:0%
about standards and also about
 
05:56:15.830 --> 05:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
collaboration here in new hampshire
 
05:56:17.430 --> 05:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
um i had three points i wanted to go
 
05:56:18.628 --> 05:56:18.638 align:start position:0%
over the first is that mental health
 
05:56:20.150 --> 05:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
court works i think you've heard enough
 
05:56:21.830 --> 05:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
about that today
 
05:56:23.110 --> 05:56:23.120 align:start position:0%
the second point though is about
 
05:56:24.628 --> 05:56:24.638 align:start position:0%
standards that
 
05:56:26.948 --> 05:56:26.958 align:start position:0%
i think a bill that supports standards
 
05:56:29.270 --> 05:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
will help new hampshire develop
 
05:56:32.390 --> 05:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
standards that are unique for our state
 
05:56:32.400 --> 05:56:33.190 align:start position:0%
standards that are unique for our state
so

05:56:33.190 --> 05:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:56:35.030 --> 05:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
there's many different kinds of mental
 
05:56:36.788 --> 05:56:36.798 align:start position:0%
health courts some focus only on
 
05:56:38.470 --> 05:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
felonies others focus only on
 
05:56:38.480 --> 05:56:39.830 align:start position:0%
felonies others focus only on
misdemeanors

05:56:39.830 --> 05:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors
 
05:56:42.230 --> 05:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
mental health courts that are focused on
 
05:56:45.350 --> 05:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
just state-specific goals state-specific
 
05:56:47.590 --> 05:56:47.600 align:start position:0%
priorities that would fit our existing
 
05:56:49.190 --> 05:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
mental health system and fit our
 
05:56:51.510 --> 05:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
existing drug court system is why this
 
05:56:54.390 --> 05:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
bill is important so having a a
 
05:56:57.750 --> 05:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
state-bound set of standards is what we
 
05:56:59.190 --> 05:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
really need
 
05:57:00.868 --> 05:57:00.878 align:start position:0%
and then i think a statewide approach is
 
05:57:02.628 --> 05:57:02.638 align:start position:0%
also necessary as you're seeing we have
 
05:57:04.150 --> 05:57:04.160 align:start position:0%
sort of a piecemeal approach at this
 
05:57:04.160 --> 05:57:04.948 align:start position:0%
sort of a piecemeal approach at this
point

05:57:04.948 --> 05:57:04.958 align:start position:0%
point
 
05:57:06.548 --> 05:57:06.558 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of collaboration in new
 
05:57:09.750 --> 05:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire but it's by jurisdiction
 
05:57:12.070 --> 05:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
most often it's different counties or
 
05:57:12.080 --> 05:57:13.030 align:start position:0%
most often it's different counties or
different

05:57:13.030 --> 05:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
different
 
05:57:14.788 --> 05:57:14.798 align:start position:0%
specific areas of the state that are
 
05:57:17.590 --> 05:57:17.600 align:start position:0%
working together but as a state-wide
 
05:57:19.430 --> 05:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
approach this will allow us to make sure
 
05:57:21.510 --> 05:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
that just as they were saying about drug
 
05:57:24.070 --> 05:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
courts that this the mental health court
 
05:57:26.070 --> 05:57:26.080 align:start position:0%
up in stratford county will look the
 
05:57:27.510 --> 05:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
same as the mental health court in
 
05:57:28.948 --> 05:57:28.958 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county
 
05:57:30.868 --> 05:57:30.878 align:start position:0%
and more importantly right now coast
 
05:57:33.110 --> 05:57:33.120 align:start position:0%
county doesn't have one so as for
 
05:57:35.190 --> 05:57:35.200 align:start position:0%
example someone in my role i have to
 
05:57:36.708 --> 05:57:36.718 align:start position:0%
remember that there are different
 
05:57:38.948 --> 05:57:38.958 align:start position:0%
options available to different
 
05:57:41.030 --> 05:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
defendants throughout the state
 
05:57:43.510 --> 05:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
i find this generally unfair
 
05:57:45.830 --> 05:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
and i think is a statewide approach that
 
05:57:47.590 --> 05:57:47.600 align:start position:0%
it's one of those times where the rising
 
05:57:49.990 --> 05:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
tide will raise all ships that as long
 
05:57:51.910 --> 05:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
as we have a statewide approach
 
05:57:53.750 --> 05:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
then every county will be able to speak
 
05:57:55.430 --> 05:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
the same language
 
05:57:57.110 --> 05:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
and be able to address these complicated
 
05:57:58.788 --> 05:57:58.798 align:start position:0%
issues in the same way
 
05:58:01.110 --> 05:58:01.120 align:start position:0%
so as this is having a statewide
 
05:58:02.868 --> 05:58:02.878 align:start position:0%
approach will be especially useful when
 
05:58:04.788 --> 05:58:04.798 align:start position:0%
there has been collaboration across
 
05:58:06.788 --> 05:58:06.798 align:start position:0%
counties but then we'll bring in more
 
05:58:09.270 --> 05:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
counties into this conversation
 
05:58:10.948 --> 05:58:10.958 align:start position:0%
uh that's all i have to offer today but
 
05:58:12.150 --> 05:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
i just want to thank you all for your
 
05:58:14.548 --> 05:58:14.558 align:start position:0%
service to our state
 
05:58:16.230 --> 05:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
thank you ms vader any questions from
 
05:58:18.868 --> 05:58:18.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:21.830 --> 05:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
see none thank you very much
 
05:58:24.708 --> 05:58:24.718 align:start position:0%
and i don't see any other hands up
 
05:58:28.150 --> 05:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
and so i'm going to declare the hearing
 
05:58:32.310 --> 05:58:32.320 align:start position:0%
on house bill 578 closed
 
05:58:34.548 --> 05:58:34.558 align:start position:0%
and call to order
 
05:58:36.788 --> 05:58:36.798 align:start position:0%
the hearing on our last bill today which
 
05:58:39.990 --> 05:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
is house bill 561.
 
05:58:41.830 --> 05:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
i will note that
 
05:58:44.788 --> 05:58:44.798 align:start position:0%
with regard to the sign up sheets nobody
 
05:58:46.548 --> 05:58:46.558 align:start position:0%
signed up in support
 
05:58:48.868 --> 05:58:48.878 align:start position:0%
nobody signed up in opposition
 
05:58:51.670 --> 05:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
and no one signed up to testify
 
05:58:51.680 --> 05:58:53.110 align:start position:0%
and no one signed up to testify
um

05:58:53.110 --> 05:58:53.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:58:53.120 --> 05:58:54.390 align:start position:0%
um
a

05:58:54.390 --> 05:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:58:57.510 --> 05:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
bill's uh primary and only sponsors
 
05:58:59.990 --> 05:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative cofo and
 
05:59:01.830 --> 05:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
i don't know if representative cofold
 
05:59:01.840 --> 05:59:02.708 align:start position:0%
i don't know if representative cofold
yeah

05:59:02.708 --> 05:59:02.718 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:59:04.310 --> 05:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
he's here
 
05:59:06.070 --> 05:59:06.080 align:start position:0%
so representative cofoult if you'd like
 
05:59:07.830 --> 05:59:07.840 align:start position:0%
to introduce your bill this is a bill
 
05:59:10.070 --> 05:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
relative to potential jurors excused
 
05:59:12.150 --> 05:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
from jury duty due to a lack of
 
05:59:16.948 --> 05:59:16.958 align:start position:0%
residency in the county of jury service
 
05:59:19.910 --> 05:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um so this this is
 
05:59:22.470 --> 05:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
quite a simple bill
 
05:59:26.150 --> 05:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
this bill is about voter integrity and
 
05:59:26.160 --> 05:59:27.190 align:start position:0%
this bill is about voter integrity and
the

05:59:27.190 --> 05:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:59:29.030 --> 05:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
you know the the
 
05:59:31.430 --> 05:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
the driving force behind this i think is
 
05:59:33.190 --> 05:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
is the idea that
 
05:59:35.270 --> 05:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh citizen involvement is vital to good
 
05:59:37.190 --> 05:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
government and that includes visibility
 
05:59:39.990 --> 05:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
to government proceedings and records
 
05:59:40.000 --> 05:59:42.230 align:start position:0%
to government proceedings and records
as

05:59:42.230 --> 05:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
as
 
05:59:44.310 --> 05:59:44.320 align:start position:0%
specified in part 1 article 8 of the new
 
05:59:46.948 --> 05:59:46.958 align:start position:0%
hampshire constitution
 
05:59:49.670 --> 05:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
today there is a great deal of attention
 
05:59:52.470 --> 05:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
focused on election integrity
 
05:59:54.548 --> 05:59:54.558 align:start position:0%
in many cases it is the citizen
 
05:59:56.788 --> 05:59:56.798 align:start position:0%
activists who are
 
05:59:58.310 --> 05:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
tracking down
 
06:00:01.430 --> 06:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
questionable cases and irregularities
 
06:00:04.310 --> 06:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
this bill provides visibility as to who
 
06:00:05.830 --> 06:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
may be registered to vote in new
 
06:00:05.840 --> 06:00:07.030 align:start position:0%
may be registered to vote in new
hampshire

06:00:07.030 --> 06:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
06:00:09.030 --> 06:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
but later claims not to live in new
 
06:00:09.040 --> 06:00:11.270 align:start position:0%
but later claims not to live in new
hampshire

06:00:11.270 --> 06:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
06:00:13.670 --> 06:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
such cases do not indicate primophasia
 
06:00:16.788 --> 06:00:16.798 align:start position:0%
evidence of illegal voting however it
 
06:00:18.548 --> 06:00:18.558 align:start position:0%
does help
 
06:00:21.190 --> 06:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
someone who is trying to identify such
 
06:00:23.750 --> 06:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
cases to identify potential voting
 
06:00:25.190 --> 06:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
irregularities so that they can be
 
06:00:26.868 --> 06:00:26.878 align:start position:0%
investigated further
 
06:00:30.070 --> 06:00:30.080 align:start position:0%
so this is a small tool in a much
 
06:00:31.750 --> 06:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
much larger
 
06:00:31.760 --> 06:00:32.948 align:start position:0%
much larger
toolbox

06:00:32.948 --> 06:00:32.958 align:start position:0%
toolbox
 
06:00:34.470 --> 06:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
citizens have a right to investigate
 
06:00:36.470 --> 06:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
potential issues of voting irregularity
 
06:00:38.150 --> 06:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
and they should have an opportunity to
 
06:00:41.430 --> 06:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
do so by examining government records
 
06:00:42.548 --> 06:00:42.558 align:start position:0%
part one article eight of the new
 
06:00:44.548 --> 06:00:44.558 align:start position:0%
hampshire constitution states government
 
06:00:46.788 --> 06:00:46.798 align:start position:0%
therefore should be open accessible
 
06:00:49.030 --> 06:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
accountable and responsive
 
06:00:50.708 --> 06:00:50.718 align:start position:0%
to that end the public's right of access
 
06:00:53.910 --> 06:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
to governmental proceedings and records
 
06:00:56.788 --> 06:00:56.798 align:start position:0%
shall not be unreasonably restricted
 
06:00:59.670 --> 06:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
this bill would make sure that
 
06:01:03.750 --> 06:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
the the records concerning who has
 
06:01:05.750 --> 06:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
who has asked to be excused from jury
 
06:01:05.760 --> 06:01:07.030 align:start position:0%
who has asked to be excused from jury
duty

06:01:07.030 --> 06:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
duty
 
06:01:08.708 --> 06:01:08.718 align:start position:0%
for lack of residence in the county in
 
06:01:11.110 --> 06:01:11.120 align:start position:0%
which they are asked to serve
 
06:01:13.190 --> 06:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
that those records be made available to
 
06:01:15.030 --> 06:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
the public and for this reason i ask
 
06:01:17.750 --> 06:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
that you support hb 561
 
06:01:23.110 --> 06:01:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:25.430 --> 06:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
thank you and representative oregon do
 
06:01:29.510 --> 06:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:30.868 --> 06:01:30.878 align:start position:0%
he actually
 
06:01:32.788 --> 06:01:32.798 align:start position:0%
answered answered my first question
 
06:01:34.470 --> 06:01:34.480 align:start position:0%
right there in the uh first sentence
 
06:01:37.110 --> 06:01:37.120 align:start position:0%
that this is about uh
 
06:01:38.788 --> 06:01:38.798 align:start position:0%
about what he referred to as voter
 
06:01:40.708 --> 06:01:40.718 align:start position:0%
integrity i might use a different uh
 
06:01:44.150 --> 06:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
word after voters like this is indeed to
 
06:01:45.590 --> 06:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
try to find uh
 
06:01:48.150 --> 06:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
this is indeed try to uh trying to chase
 
06:01:50.390 --> 06:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
voters who uh
 
06:01:52.310 --> 06:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
may or may not have moved out of their
 
06:01:54.470 --> 06:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
county so that's uh thank you for
 
06:01:56.628 --> 06:01:56.638 align:start position:0%
answering that revenue call faulty
 
06:01:59.350 --> 06:01:59.360 align:start position:0%
other new other question is why is it
 
06:02:00.868 --> 06:02:00.878 align:start position:0%
how many
 
06:02:02.708 --> 06:02:02.718 align:start position:0%
how many people is this going to catch
 
06:02:04.948 --> 06:02:04.958 align:start position:0%
and um like why
 
06:02:07.190 --> 06:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
and uh why is it every six months
 
06:02:08.470 --> 06:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
instead of you know
 
06:02:10.230 --> 06:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
on a rolling basis and um
 
06:02:10.240 --> 06:02:11.510 align:start position:0%
on a rolling basis and um
[Music]

06:02:11.510 --> 06:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:02:12.948 --> 06:02:12.958 align:start position:0%
also is
 
06:02:15.190 --> 06:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
being uh she's for jury duty is that's
 
06:02:16.390 --> 06:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
something that's normally a public
 
06:02:18.628 --> 06:02:18.638 align:start position:0%
record i was i've been excused from jury
 
06:02:20.230 --> 06:02:20.240 align:start position:0%
duty actually ironically because of my
 
06:02:22.868 --> 06:02:22.878 align:start position:0%
service on the judiciary committee but i
 
06:02:22.878 --> 06:02:23.670 align:start position:0%
service on the judiciary committee but i
don't

06:02:23.670 --> 06:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
don't
 
06:02:25.430 --> 06:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
i don't recall whether or not they said
 
06:02:26.948 --> 06:02:26.958 align:start position:0%
that was confidential not that i would
 
06:02:29.030 --> 06:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
have had any problem with being telling
 
06:02:30.868 --> 06:02:30.878 align:start position:0%
people excuse for that reason so that's
 
06:02:30.878 --> 06:02:31.670 align:start position:0%
people excuse for that reason so that's
uh

06:02:31.670 --> 06:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:02:33.990 --> 06:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
why so that's those are my two specific
 
06:02:35.430 --> 06:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
questions they asked why every six
 
06:02:38.070 --> 06:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
months instead on continued basis and uh
 
06:02:38.080 --> 06:02:39.430 align:start position:0%
months instead on continued basis and uh
like

06:02:39.430 --> 06:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
like
 
06:02:39.440 --> 06:02:40.628 align:start position:0%
like
and

06:02:40.628 --> 06:02:40.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:02:42.070 --> 06:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
are people who have
 
06:02:43.990 --> 06:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
chief and jury duty regularly have their
 
06:02:45.270 --> 06:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
names made public or is this an
 
06:02:48.390 --> 06:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
exception to that
 
06:02:50.708 --> 06:02:50.718 align:start position:0%
uh so to the first question um i think
 
06:02:53.350 --> 06:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
that doing it every six months uh
 
06:02:55.590 --> 06:02:55.600 align:start position:0%
relieves the uh the state of an
 
06:02:58.390 --> 06:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
excessive um
 
06:03:00.230 --> 06:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
an excessive administrative burden it
 
06:03:02.548 --> 06:03:02.558 align:start position:0%
makes it actually quite easy i think to
 
06:03:04.150 --> 06:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
to report those names to the secretary
 
06:03:05.670 --> 06:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
of state and for the secretary of state
 
06:03:08.548 --> 06:03:08.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:08.558 --> 06:03:09.510 align:start position:0%
 
and

06:03:09.510 --> 06:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:03:12.628 --> 06:03:12.638 align:start position:0%
as to the second question
 
06:03:14.548 --> 06:03:14.558 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware that
 
06:03:17.030 --> 06:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
such names are currently
 
06:03:19.110 --> 06:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
considered to be
 
06:03:21.910 --> 06:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
confidential or public uh this just
 
06:03:23.430 --> 06:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
merely would make them public make it
 
06:03:25.510 --> 06:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
public that that people have asked to be
 
06:03:25.520 --> 06:03:31.670 align:start position:0%
public that that people have asked to be
excused

06:03:31.670 --> 06:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:33.910 --> 06:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah one question
 
06:03:35.910 --> 06:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
presumably uh
 
06:03:37.590 --> 06:03:37.600 align:start position:0%
filing period i guess probably was after
 
06:03:39.350 --> 06:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
the election and as you know we had a
 
06:03:40.948 --> 06:03:40.958 align:start position:0%
very protracted uh
 
06:03:43.190 --> 06:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
a very uncommitted transition power so
 
06:03:45.670 --> 06:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
do you think the events of uh
 
06:03:48.548 --> 06:03:48.558 align:start position:0%
they came between uh on november 6th i
 
06:03:50.150 --> 06:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
guess with the date last year and
 
06:03:50.160 --> 06:03:51.270 align:start position:0%
guess with the date last year and
january

06:03:51.270 --> 06:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
january
 
06:03:53.830 --> 06:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
20th this is a rise in january
 
06:03:55.830 --> 06:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
that give you
 
06:03:57.510 --> 06:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
even any second thought about whether or
 
06:03:59.910 --> 06:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
not this bill or anything that makes it
 
06:04:00.948 --> 06:04:00.958 align:start position:0%
harder for
 
06:04:02.868 --> 06:04:02.878 align:start position:0%
people to vote is a good idea like do
 
06:04:04.150 --> 06:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
you think this
 
06:04:05.430 --> 06:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
those events make this fellowship more
 
06:04:07.670 --> 06:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
necessary to you less that's necessary
 
06:04:09.910 --> 06:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
or does it have no effect
 
06:04:09.920 --> 06:04:10.788 align:start position:0%
or does it have no effect
i

06:04:10.788 --> 06:04:10.798 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:04:12.470 --> 06:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
don't believe that this makes it harder
 
06:04:14.548 --> 06:04:14.558 align:start position:0%
for any to anyone to vote in any way
 
06:04:17.990 --> 06:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
whatsoever um i had not i don't believe
 
06:04:21.190 --> 06:04:21.200 align:start position:0%
this is about
 
06:04:23.670 --> 06:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
any any recent events per se i do
 
06:04:25.030 --> 06:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
believe that there's quite a lot of
 
06:04:27.510 --> 06:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
interest in this topic right now
 
06:04:29.830 --> 06:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
but i think this is a necessary bill
 
06:04:32.150 --> 06:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
whether it happens now or
 
06:04:36.788 --> 06:04:36.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:41.430 --> 06:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:43.430 --> 06:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
06:04:46.070 --> 06:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative kobalt
 
06:04:46.080 --> 06:04:47.270 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative kobalt
um

06:04:47.270 --> 06:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:49.430 --> 06:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
i was a little puzzled when i
 
06:04:51.670 --> 06:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
read this bill because i did not see the
 
06:04:54.708 --> 06:04:54.718 align:start position:0%
word vote anywhere in the bill
 
06:04:54.718 --> 06:04:55.510 align:start position:0%
word vote anywhere in the bill
um

06:04:55.510 --> 06:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:57.110 --> 06:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
that's just a comment and now i have a
 
06:04:58.788 --> 06:04:58.798 align:start position:0%
question i've been living in new
 
06:05:01.110 --> 06:05:01.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire for 28 years i've been called
 
06:05:03.190 --> 06:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
the jury duty once
 
06:05:04.390 --> 06:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
so i'm
 
06:05:04.400 --> 06:05:05.750 align:start position:0%
so i'm
really

06:05:05.750 --> 06:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
really
 
06:05:08.788 --> 06:05:08.798 align:start position:0%
wondering if this bill is really needed
 
06:05:12.390 --> 06:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:13.270 --> 06:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
06:05:15.270 --> 06:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
representative uh so
 
06:05:18.150 --> 06:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
so i i too have been called once in the
 
06:05:19.830 --> 06:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
time that i have lived in new hampshire
 
06:05:21.190 --> 06:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
which is i think less than the time
 
06:05:22.470 --> 06:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
you've lived here
 
06:05:25.910 --> 06:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh but i uh you know to to me this this
 
06:05:27.590 --> 06:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
is not necessarily a question about the
 
06:05:29.270 --> 06:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
frequency at which people are called to
 
06:05:29.280 --> 06:05:30.310 align:start position:0%
frequency at which people are called to
serve

06:05:30.310 --> 06:05:30.320 align:start position:0%
serve
 
06:05:32.708 --> 06:05:32.718 align:start position:0%
um you know it to me this is this is
 
06:05:34.708 --> 06:05:34.718 align:start position:0%
fundamentally a question about
 
06:05:34.718 --> 06:05:35.750 align:start position:0%
fundamentally a question about
um

06:05:35.750 --> 06:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:05:38.628 --> 06:05:38.638 align:start position:0%
you know providing another tool to uh to
 
06:05:41.990 --> 06:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
to understand um who is registered to
 
06:05:43.670 --> 06:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
vote but not
 
06:05:47.030 --> 06:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
serving jury duty as i said before
 
06:05:49.990 --> 06:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
that that may or may not be evidence uh
 
06:05:51.670 --> 06:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
you know it really isn't
 
06:05:54.150 --> 06:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
prime prime aphasia evidence of of
 
06:05:56.948 --> 06:05:56.958 align:start position:0%
something being wrong but it is one tool
 
06:05:59.750 --> 06:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
in a much larger toolbox so do i believe
 
06:06:02.150 --> 06:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
that this will um sort of open the
 
06:06:04.070 --> 06:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
floodgates to discovering all kinds of
 
06:06:05.990 --> 06:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
malfeasance no
 
06:06:08.390 --> 06:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
do i think that it will be a tool that
 
06:06:10.470 --> 06:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
could be used by citizens to ensure
 
06:06:14.788 --> 06:06:14.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:17.110 --> 06:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
06:06:19.190 --> 06:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i'm a little
 
06:06:22.390 --> 06:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
confused the bill came to judiciary and
 
06:06:24.788 --> 06:06:24.798 align:start position:0%
i assume it's because of
 
06:06:24.798 --> 06:06:25.830 align:start position:0%
i assume it's because of
um

06:06:25.830 --> 06:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:06:27.670 --> 06:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
jury service
 
06:06:29.910 --> 06:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
but the testimony
 
06:06:32.868 --> 06:06:32.878 align:start position:0%
has all been not about jury service but
 
06:06:34.708 --> 06:06:34.718 align:start position:0%
about voting
 
06:06:38.150 --> 06:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:40.788 --> 06:06:40.798 align:start position:0%
so i i wonder why i didn't go to
 
06:06:42.310 --> 06:06:42.320 align:start position:0%
election law
 
06:06:44.390 --> 06:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
and um
 
06:06:46.628 --> 06:06:46.638 align:start position:0%
while we're at it i'd like to say that
 
06:06:49.430 --> 06:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
i've never been called for jury service
 
06:06:51.670 --> 06:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
and i very much would have liked to have
 
06:06:53.910 --> 06:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
been called and i'm wondering if there
 
06:06:55.510 --> 06:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
might be a way to
 
06:06:57.830 --> 06:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
to investigate why some of us don't get
 
06:07:00.310 --> 06:07:00.320 align:start position:0%
called to jury service even when we live
 
06:07:02.948 --> 06:07:02.958 align:start position:0%
in the county
 
06:07:07.030 --> 06:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:08.708 --> 06:07:08.718 align:start position:0%
is that a question
 
06:07:08.718 --> 06:07:09.750 align:start position:0%
is that a question
well

06:07:09.750 --> 06:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:07:11.990 --> 06:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
yes i mean why is this
 
06:07:14.070 --> 06:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
do you not see this as an election law
 
06:07:16.310 --> 06:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
problem rather than a
 
06:07:19.510 --> 06:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
judiciary committee problem
 
06:07:22.070 --> 06:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
i i uh thank you representative i would
 
06:07:24.868 --> 06:07:24.878 align:start position:0%
i would defer to to house leadership um
 
06:07:27.270 --> 06:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
as they are the ones that assigned this
 
06:07:31.110 --> 06:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
to uh to the the judiciary committee
 
06:07:33.830 --> 06:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
um you know i i i'm guessing that it's
 
06:07:36.390 --> 06:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
because it pertains to
 
06:07:39.270 --> 06:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
the publication of information
 
06:07:41.750 --> 06:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
on people who were selected as potential
 
06:07:41.760 --> 06:07:42.788 align:start position:0%
on people who were selected as potential
jurors

06:07:42.788 --> 06:07:42.798 align:start position:0%
jurors
 
06:07:45.030 --> 06:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
um to your second point for what it's
 
06:07:47.270 --> 06:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
worth i i i fully agree with you i i
 
06:07:49.190 --> 06:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
would be very interested in uh better
 
06:07:51.830 --> 06:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
understanding uh how that process works
 
06:07:53.990 --> 06:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
and and why some people are chosen and
 
06:07:56.628 --> 06:07:56.638 align:start position:0%
some are not um i personally was chosen
 
06:07:58.548 --> 06:07:58.558 align:start position:0%
for a very high profile criminal case
 
06:08:01.110 --> 06:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
and you know it was it was a it was a
 
06:08:03.910 --> 06:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
an insightful opportunity to see how the
 
06:08:05.670 --> 06:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
system works so
 
06:08:08.070 --> 06:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
it was really i think a pleasure to uh
 
06:08:10.390 --> 06:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
to be part of that
 
06:08:12.390 --> 06:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your response
 
06:08:16.310 --> 06:08:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:17.830 --> 06:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps we could arrange for it to go to
 
06:08:23.750 --> 06:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:25.590 --> 06:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
are there any other
 
06:08:27.590 --> 06:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
representative gordon
 
06:08:30.548 --> 06:08:30.558 align:start position:0%
yes if i may um you know just to point
 
06:08:32.788 --> 06:08:32.798 align:start position:0%
out that you know it did go to judiciary
 
06:08:32.798 --> 06:08:34.230 align:start position:0%
out that you know it did go to judiciary
because

06:08:34.230 --> 06:08:34.240 align:start position:0%
because
 
06:08:35.910 --> 06:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
quite frankly we didn't have a crystal
 
06:08:37.750 --> 06:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
ball to know that this was going to lead
 
06:08:37.760 --> 06:08:39.430 align:start position:0%
ball to know that this was going to lead
to

06:08:39.430 --> 06:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:08:40.868 --> 06:08:40.878 align:start position:0%
a bill about
 
06:08:42.628 --> 06:08:42.638 align:start position:0%
voter integrity
 
06:08:44.708 --> 06:08:44.718 align:start position:0%
so um
 
06:08:48.150 --> 06:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
you know and i don't see the word vote
 
06:08:50.390 --> 06:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
voting any or elections anywhere in the
 
06:08:52.868 --> 06:08:52.878 align:start position:0%
bill so i imagine that's why it was sent
 
06:08:54.868 --> 06:08:54.878 align:start position:0%
to judiciary
 
06:08:56.708 --> 06:08:56.718 align:start position:0%
i i don't think you need to be defensive
 
06:08:59.750 --> 06:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
i think i i can see the why it was sent
 
06:09:02.788 --> 06:09:02.798 align:start position:0%
to judiciary based on its face and
 
06:09:04.310 --> 06:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
uh but
 
06:09:04.320 --> 06:09:05.430 align:start position:0%
uh but
perhaps

06:09:05.430 --> 06:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
06:09:08.070 --> 06:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
it could go to a second committee and in
 
06:09:10.708 --> 06:09:10.718 align:start position:0%
some in some manner i think we've missed
 
06:09:13.190 --> 06:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
the deadline on that represent mr
 
06:09:15.830 --> 06:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
chairman we have this year
 
06:09:15.840 --> 06:09:17.670 align:start position:0%
chairman we have this year
yes

06:09:17.670 --> 06:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:09:19.350 --> 06:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
i mean you could always retain the bill
 
06:09:19.360 --> 06:09:19.990 align:start position:0%
i mean you could always retain the bill
and

06:09:19.990 --> 06:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:09:21.750 --> 06:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
send it to a second committee next year
 
06:09:25.190 --> 06:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
that's another possibility
 
06:09:26.708 --> 06:09:26.718 align:start position:0%
representative oregon
 
06:09:26.718 --> 06:09:28.548 align:start position:0%
representative oregon
yes

06:09:28.548 --> 06:09:28.558 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:09:31.030 --> 06:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
um i have a second question so thank you
 
06:09:32.708 --> 06:09:32.718 align:start position:0%
for accommodating mr chair thank you
 
06:09:34.868 --> 06:09:34.878 align:start position:0%
very cold fault um
 
06:09:34.878 --> 06:09:35.750 align:start position:0%
very cold fault um
why

06:09:35.750 --> 06:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
why
 
06:09:38.390 --> 06:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
why did you limit it to just that uh one
 
06:09:39.830 --> 06:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
reason since there's any number of
 
06:09:41.910 --> 06:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
reasons why people excuse me jury duty
 
06:09:41.920 --> 06:09:42.788 align:start position:0%
reasons why people excuse me jury duty
and

06:09:42.788 --> 06:09:42.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:09:44.628 --> 06:09:44.638 align:start position:0%
mandate having a list of everyone who's
 
06:09:47.190 --> 06:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
excused from jury duties so then you can
 
06:09:48.948 --> 06:09:48.958 align:start position:0%
cross-check that list against voter
 
06:09:51.510 --> 06:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
rolls in order of your attempts to catch
 
06:09:52.868 --> 06:09:52.878 align:start position:0%
people who
 
06:09:55.350 --> 06:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
are vote voting in the wrong place
 
06:09:55.360 --> 06:09:56.150 align:start position:0%
are vote voting in the wrong place
that

06:09:56.150 --> 06:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:10:00.310 --> 06:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:02.948 --> 06:10:02.958 align:start position:0%
well i i you're talking about why did i
 
06:10:05.670 --> 06:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
why does the bill say for lack of
 
06:10:07.510 --> 06:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
being excused for lack of residence is
 
06:10:07.520 --> 06:10:08.628 align:start position:0%
being excused for lack of residence is
that

06:10:08.628 --> 06:10:08.638 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:10:11.350 --> 06:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
your question okay um because lack of
 
06:10:16.310 --> 06:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
residence would indicate a um a a
 
06:10:16.320 --> 06:10:17.190 align:start position:0%
residence would indicate a um a a
um

06:10:17.190 --> 06:10:17.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:10:22.390 --> 06:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
a lack of domicile in that uh
 
06:10:24.390 --> 06:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
in that in that county
 
06:10:28.310 --> 06:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
which may indicate a lack of um of of
 
06:10:31.190 --> 06:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
the right to vote it also may not um you
 
06:10:32.310 --> 06:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
know they may have moved to a different
 
06:10:34.310 --> 06:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
part of new hampshire
 
06:10:36.868 --> 06:10:36.878 align:start position:0%
they also may be an overseas voter
 
06:10:38.628 --> 06:10:38.638 align:start position:0%
so if you're in the military or
 
06:10:38.638 --> 06:10:40.070 align:start position:0%
so if you're in the military or
otherwise

06:10:40.070 --> 06:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
06:10:42.070 --> 06:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
overseas you
 
06:10:44.310 --> 06:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
have a right to vote from your last new
 
06:10:44.320 --> 06:10:45.910 align:start position:0%
have a right to vote from your last new
hampshire

06:10:45.910 --> 06:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
06:10:47.750 --> 06:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
address so you can remain registered to
 
06:10:47.760 --> 06:10:49.510 align:start position:0%
address so you can remain registered to
vote

06:10:49.510 --> 06:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
vote
 
06:10:51.430 --> 06:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
from your last new hampshire address so
 
06:10:53.670 --> 06:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
the fact that somebody is registered to
 
06:10:56.548 --> 06:10:56.558 align:start position:0%
vote and indeed is still voting
 
06:10:58.390 --> 06:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
but has asked to be excused from jury
 
06:11:01.190 --> 06:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
duty for lack of of residence in
 
06:11:03.030 --> 06:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
the county where they're registered
 
06:11:04.948 --> 06:11:04.958 align:start position:0%
again is not private prime aphasia
 
06:11:09.110 --> 06:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:10.390 --> 06:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
06:11:12.390 --> 06:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
any other questions for
 
06:11:16.150 --> 06:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
