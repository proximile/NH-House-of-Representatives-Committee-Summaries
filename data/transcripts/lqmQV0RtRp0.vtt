00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
okay so it appears we have a quorum
 
00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
i've been trying to call representative
 
00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:40.800 align:start position:0%

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
but anyway this is our
 
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:00.870 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to have us introduce ourselves
 
00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
and also to let you know what we'll be
 
00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
doing this year
 
00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:12.959 align:start position:0%
so far the uh
 
00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
uh the speaker has not yet decided
 
00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
that what we'll be doing
 
00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
hi john well that's that's his voice man
 
00:10:28.389 --> 00:10:28.399 align:start position:0%
um so i'm trying to schedule
 
00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
a public hearing for next week next week
 
00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
it will be entirely remote they won't
 
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
let people into the building
 
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
and um so
 
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
that'll be a challenge to do it properly
 
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
later on i believe we will have hybrid
 
00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:47.590 align:start position:0%
later on i believe we will have hybrid
meetings

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:50.720 align:start position:0%
so if anyone exp i would expect that as
 
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
many people as possible
 
00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:56.000 align:start position:0%

up

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:10:58.829 --> 00:10:58.839 align:start position:0%
if you will not be attending under any
 
00:10:58.839 --> 00:11:00.230 align:start position:0%
if you will not be attending under any
circumstances

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:00.240 align:start position:0%

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
busy committee this is my third term
 
00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:17.519 align:start position:0%

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
we're finished
 
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:28.560 align:start position:0%

excellent um this is going to be a very
 
00:30:40.389 --> 00:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
strange year
 
00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
because as i said we will be working
 
00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:47.039 align:start position:0%
remotely for at least the next couple of
 
00:30:47.039 --> 00:30:47.669 align:start position:0%
remotely for at least the next couple of

00:30:47.669 --> 00:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
i hope we will be able to get at least
 
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
into a hybrid situation
 
00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
but i haven't seen it um
 
00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
and most most of my comments would only
 
00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
apply if we're in the lob so i don't
 
00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
have anything more to say
 
00:31:06.149 --> 00:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
madam chair you did mention at the
 
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
beginning um
 
00:31:11.909 --> 00:31:11.919 align:start position:0%
that you were hopeful that we could
 
00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
connect to
 
00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
a more normal type of meeting and
 
00:31:20.149 --> 00:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
if that happens uh i just
 
00:31:23.509 --> 00:31:23.519 align:start position:0%
want to be sure are you going to uh
 
00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
mandate that everyone wears a mask if
 
00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
we're meeting in the
 
00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:30.640 align:start position:0%
lob that's not something for me to do
 
00:31:32.389 --> 00:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
that's something for the
 
00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
speaker and the house and the
 
00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
and committee services i believe that
 
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
thank you we will definitely be spread
 
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
from what i understand we will be spread
 
00:31:48.149 --> 00:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
out in a double room
 
00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
with only the committee and the staff
 
00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
and possibly
 
00:31:54.389 --> 00:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
one person from one of the agencies with
 
00:31:54.399 --> 00:31:55.029 align:start position:0%
one person from one of the agencies with
us

00:31:55.029 --> 00:31:55.039 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
so we'll have plenty of room they've got
 
00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
extra filtrate air filtration
 
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
systems that they're working on
 
00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:03.519 align:start position:0%
installing in the lob
 
00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:07.039 align:start position:0%
because the current air system is
 
00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:10.640 align:start position:0%
not adequate and masks will be mandated
 
00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
as far as i know
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
yes i believe that's a policy that's
 
00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
been adopted by the facilities committee
 
00:32:18.549 --> 00:32:18.559 align:start position:0%
and is in place now that throughout the

and is in place now that throughout the
complex

00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
complex
 
00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:26.320 align:start position:0%

a

00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
welcoming notice with the subcommittee
 
00:32:34.789 --> 00:32:34.799 align:start position:0%
assignments because
 
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
we do most of our detailed work in
 
00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:38.389 align:start position:0%
we do most of our detailed work in
subcommittee

00:32:38.389 --> 00:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
and i like to have standing subcommittee
 
00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
so that you get to know
 
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
the areas i mean the knowing a lot about
 
00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
administrative rules doesn't necessarily
 
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
mean you know anything about licensing
 
00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:52.559 align:start position:0%
and so you get to work on a
 
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
group of bills that are on the same
 
00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:56.070 align:start position:0%
group of bills that are on the same
topic

00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
topic
 
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:04.320 align:start position:0%

pam smarling you can see it on the
screen

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
screen
 
00:33:10.389 --> 00:33:10.399 align:start position:0%

00:33:13.509 --> 00:33:13.519 align:start position:0%

for all kinds of things you know beyond
 
00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:21.360 align:start position:0%

um beyond research um
 
00:33:26.149 --> 00:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
especially in the zoom age and one
 
00:33:28.149 --> 00:33:28.159 align:start position:0%
question that i i want to just
 
00:33:30.149 --> 00:33:30.159 align:start position:0%
ask is does everybody know how to raise
 
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
their hand electronically
 
00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:35.519 align:start position:0%
does anybody have a question about that
 
00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
that really is i know i just chimed in
 
00:33:39.669 --> 00:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
without raising my hand and i apologize
 
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
in general that helps
 
00:33:46.549 --> 00:33:46.559 align:start position:0%
the meeting all right looks like
 
00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
yes i think it was representative scitec
 
00:34:08.950 --> 00:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
i have i have muted you representative
 
00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:12.230 align:start position:0%
i have i have muted you representative
scitec

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
if you could tell john that on his
 
00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
computer there should be
 
00:34:20.149 --> 00:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
a mute button on his computer that if he
 
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
mutes the computer then he can just use
 
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:29.349 --> 00:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
he should be able to hear you he's
 
00:34:32.829 --> 00:34:32.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:52.950 --> 00:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
the other item i would just briefly
 
00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
mention while we're
 
00:34:58.950 --> 00:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
in a sort of interim period here is that
 
00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
all of the meetings are recorded and and
 
00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
live streamed on youtube so if you
 
00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:03.990 align:start position:0%
live streamed on youtube so if you
should

00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
should
 
00:35:06.069 --> 00:35:06.079 align:start position:0%
miss a meeting um that's one of the
 
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
benefits of
 
00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
the remote meetings you can go on to the
 
00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:11.430 align:start position:0%
the remote meetings you can go on to the
house

00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:35:13.109 --> 00:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
new hampshire house of representatives
 
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
committee streaming
 
00:35:17.109 --> 00:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
youtube site and see anything that you
 
00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
may have missed
 
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
the other thing is that all of our
 
00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
committee meetings
 
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
are open to the public and
 
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
have to comply with the right to know
 
00:35:29.589 --> 00:35:29.599 align:start position:0%
laws so that
 
00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
you cannot get conduct well
 
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
you cannot talk about committee business
 
00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
if you have a quorum
 
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
of the committee present on a email
 
00:35:39.839 --> 00:35:40.470 align:start position:0%
of the committee present on a email
chain

00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
chain
 
00:35:43.589 --> 00:35:43.599 align:start position:0%
or a phone call or zoom or whatever
 
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
unless you all happen to be of one party
 
00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:53.589 --> 00:35:53.599 align:start position:0%
which is allowed without being open to
 
00:35:56.829 --> 00:35:56.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
okay and i i will add that uh
 
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
the chat feature has intentionally been
 
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
you know taken off of this meeting
 
00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
um so if you're looking for it you won't
 
00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
find it
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
ah and then that is
 
00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
deliberate to comply with right to know
 
00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
exactly that that would would have had
 
00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:16.710 align:start position:0%
exactly that that would would have had
to

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
be you know printed out and included in
 
00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
the committee file any chat and it just
 
00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
seemed simpler
 
00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
to allow people to communicate if they
 
00:36:26.069 --> 00:36:26.079 align:start position:0%
wanted to by text
 
00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
or email or some other way during the
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
meeting but not through
 
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
representative schultz you've got your
 
00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:34.800 align:start position:0%

00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
and legislative affairs uh tim
 
00:47:03.349 --> 00:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
crutchfield who's our
 
00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
deputy director and chief legal counsel
 
00:47:08.309 --> 00:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
dry murphy who is the director of
 
00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:10.720 align:start position:0%
finance and larry johansen who's the
 
00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
director of investments
 
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
so they'll all be having different
 
00:47:16.069 --> 00:47:16.079 align:start position:0%
segments and as you can see here's the
 
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
ground we're going to cover
 
00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
and if i may madam chair we're starting
 
00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
a little later than perhaps anticipated
 
00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
i'd just like to know if you could tell
 
00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:24.549 align:start position:0%
i'd just like to know if you could tell
us

00:47:24.549 --> 00:47:24.559 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:47:27.109 --> 00:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
how much time if you have a limitation
 
00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
in mind we have about 33 slides here so
 
00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
i just want everybody to be mindful of
 
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
we've blocked blocked out the morning
 
00:47:39.829 --> 00:47:39.839 align:start position:0%
for it and
 
00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
we will be breaking for lunch when we're
 
00:47:44.549 --> 00:47:44.559 align:start position:0%
done so i i believe the
 
00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
total period will depend on the
 
00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
questions as much as anything
 
00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
okay well i'll uh please feel free to
 
00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:54.640 align:start position:0%
let us know if you'd like us to move
 
00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
things along
 
00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
um it's one of those things where we
 
00:47:59.510 --> 00:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
don't want to rush uh past items but
 
00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
um obviously some of these things are
 
00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
quite complex and we can spend a lot
 
00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:04.640 align:start position:0%
more time so we'll
 
00:48:07.589 --> 00:48:07.599 align:start position:0%
keep that schedule in mind um so here's
 
00:48:09.109 --> 00:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
here the ground uh
 
00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
here's the ground we're going to cover
 
00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
today um
 
00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
marty is going to be discussing
 
00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:16.240 align:start position:0%
membership uh tim crutchfield will cover
 
00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:16.870 align:start position:0%
membership uh tim crutchfield will cover
benefits

00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
00:48:19.589 --> 00:48:19.599 align:start position:0%
larry will do investments gerard and i
 
00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
will split up the
 
00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
contribution funding section marty's
 
00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
back on for legislation
 
00:48:27.190 --> 00:48:27.200 align:start position:0%
and then we have a um a very brief
 
00:48:28.549 --> 00:48:28.559 align:start position:0%
summary slide
 
00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
so um with that
 
00:48:35.109 --> 00:48:35.119 align:start position:0%
marty it's over to you i believe
 
00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
thank you george is everyone seeing the
 
00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
slides that i'm sharing or
 
00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
is anyone not seeing them i guess is
 
00:48:48.309 --> 00:48:48.319 align:start position:0%
probably a better question
 
00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
so um some of this again for veteran
 
00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
committee members is going to be basic
 
00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
but i know we have some newcomers so
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
um nhrs is a contributory multi-employer
 
00:48:58.790 --> 00:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
defined benefit plan that was
 
00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
established in 1967
 
00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
when separate retirement plans for
 
00:49:05.109 --> 00:49:05.119 align:start position:0%
teachers police fire and
 
00:49:07.349 --> 00:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
state employees were merged uh
 
00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
contributory means that both the member
 
00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
and the employer
 
00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
contribute into the plan a
 
00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
multi-employer plan
 
00:49:18.069 --> 00:49:18.079 align:start position:0%
is represents the fact that the costs
 
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
are shared collectively among all the
 
00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
participating employers
 
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
um some states have what are called
 
00:49:25.349 --> 00:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
agent plans where each municipality has
 
00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
its own
 
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
essentially separate retirement plan and
 
00:49:29.349 --> 00:49:29.359 align:start position:0%
separate cost structure
 
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is a multi-employer plan
 
00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
so it's statewide
 
00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
we provide retirement disability and
 
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
death benefits
 
00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
as well as a post-retirement medical
 
00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:40.630 align:start position:0%
as well as a post-retirement medical
subsidy

00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
subsidy
 
00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
to eligible members and beneficiaries
 
00:49:45.109 --> 00:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
once someone attains eligibility through
 
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
vesting they can receive a guaranteed
 
00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
lifetime pension
 
00:49:51.109 --> 00:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
the vesting period is 10 years in new
 
00:49:51.119 --> 00:49:52.309 align:start position:0%
the vesting period is 10 years in new
hampshire

00:49:52.309 --> 00:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:49:54.549 --> 00:49:54.559 align:start position:0%
or if you are working at or beyond your
 
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
normal retirement age
 
00:49:59.430 --> 00:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
which is 60. our pension benefits are
 
00:50:01.589 --> 00:50:01.599 align:start position:0%
funded through employee and employer
 
00:50:01.599 --> 00:50:02.630 align:start position:0%
funded through employee and employer
contributions

00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
contributions
 
00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
and investment income on those
 
00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:06.230 align:start position:0%
and investment income on those
contributions

00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
contributions
 
00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
investment returns have historically
 
00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
provided the majority of funding for
 
00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
pension benefits over the the course of
 
00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:13.270 align:start position:0%
pension benefits over the the course of
the

00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
systems history um
 
00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
nhrs isn't a state agency per se
 
00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:20.800 align:start position:0%
like a department of safety or
 
00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
department of ed uh what's referred to
 
00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
as a component unit of state government
 
00:50:27.349 --> 00:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
um so we're not directly under the
 
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
executive branch
 
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
we're overseen by a board of trustees uh
 
00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
13 members they
 
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
which include active participating
 
00:50:38.230 --> 00:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
members of the retirement system
 
00:50:41.589 --> 00:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
representatives of uh state local
 
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh county and school employers uh four
 
00:50:46.069 --> 00:50:46.079 align:start position:0%
members of the public and the state
 
00:50:46.079 --> 00:50:47.670 align:start position:0%
members of the public and the state
treasurer

00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
treasurer
 
00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
are aboard our fiduciaries which means
 
00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
they are charged
 
00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
with acting in the best interest of the
 
00:50:56.309 --> 00:50:56.319 align:start position:0%
benefits and participants of the plan
 
00:50:57.910 --> 00:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
we also have an invest independent
 
00:50:59.349 --> 00:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
investment committee which we'll get
 
00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
into more detail on later and they are
 
00:51:03.829 --> 00:51:03.839 align:start position:0%
also fiduciaries
 
00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
the legislature is the plan sponsor and
 
00:51:12.549 --> 00:51:12.559 align:start position:0%
our law or planned document is rsa 100 a
 
00:51:14.549 --> 00:51:14.559 align:start position:0%
staff is here to implement the statute
 
00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:16.720 align:start position:0%
as well as administrative rules
 
00:51:20.069 --> 00:51:20.079 align:start position:0%
uh board and board policies in besides
 
00:51:20.079 --> 00:51:20.870 align:start position:0%
uh board and board policies in besides
the

00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:23.839 align:start position:0%
state and um internal controls on the
 
00:51:26.309 --> 00:51:26.319 align:start position:0%
retirement system we also have to be
 
00:51:28.309 --> 00:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
cognizant of the internal revenue code
 
00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
to main the taxi
 
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
we maintain the tax exam status of the
 
00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:33.190 align:start position:0%
we maintain the tax exam status of the
fund

00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:51:36.549 --> 00:51:36.559 align:start position:0%
so different layers of regulation
 
00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
sort of a lot govern of what we can and
 
00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
can't do
 
00:51:44.309 --> 00:51:44.319 align:start position:0%
in addition to rsa 100a there is a
 
00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
article in the new hampshire
 
00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:47.349 align:start position:0%
article in the new hampshire
constitution

00:51:47.349 --> 00:51:47.359 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
00:51:50.069 --> 00:51:50.079 align:start position:0%
in part one it's article 36a and among
 
00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
other things it protects the funds
 
00:51:54.549 --> 00:51:54.559 align:start position:0%
in the trust for the exclusive purpose
 
00:51:56.470 --> 00:51:56.480 align:start position:0%
of providing benefits
 
00:51:58.309 --> 00:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
it requires the board to certify
 
00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
employer contribution rates based on
 
00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
sound actuarial practice and it requires
 
00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
employees to pay the rates as certified
 
00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:15.829 --> 00:52:15.839 align:start position:0%
our trustees as i said have a fiduciary
 
00:52:15.839 --> 00:52:16.870 align:start position:0%
our trustees as i said have a fiduciary
obligation

00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
obligation
 
00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh to ensure that the plan is adequately
 
00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
funded this is sort of a
 
00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
actuarial pension plan 101 graphic
 
00:52:26.549 --> 00:52:26.559 align:start position:0%
representation of the equation
 
00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
contributions and investment income
 
00:52:30.390 --> 00:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
coming into the trust fund
 
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
need to equal benefit payments and
 
00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
expenses going out and this is a
 
00:52:35.829 --> 00:52:35.839 align:start position:0%
long-term equation this isn't a
 
00:52:35.839 --> 00:52:37.190 align:start position:0%
long-term equation this isn't a
year-over-year

00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
year-over-year
 
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh balance um and these are
 
00:52:43.349 --> 00:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
not to scale expenses or a fraction of
 
00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
the benefit payments that go out
 
00:52:48.069 --> 00:52:48.079 align:start position:0%
but it's again it's a simplified graphic
 
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
our trust fund at the close of fiscal 20
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh june 30th was at 9.134 billion
 
00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
and the next slide will just sort of
 
00:52:59.109 --> 00:52:59.119 align:start position:0%
show the
 
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
change in trust fund assets over the
 
00:53:03.670 --> 00:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
past uh 11 years
 
00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
um you know we've seen some
 
00:53:08.710 --> 00:53:08.720 align:start position:0%
some dips but steady progress and over
 
00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
this time while the the
 
00:53:12.150 --> 00:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
trust fund has grown from a little bit
 
00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
under 5 billion a little bit over nine
 
00:53:16.069 --> 00:53:16.079 align:start position:0%
we've also paid out about six billion
 
00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
um some recent initiatives that want the
 
00:53:25.510 --> 00:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
kidney media to be aware of is
 
00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
we've always had a focus on cyber
 
00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
security and data protection but it's
 
00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
it's become more enhanced as
 
00:53:35.829 --> 00:53:35.839 align:start position:0%
as the threat levels um
 
00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
grow over time we've seen what's
 
00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
happened with with the federal
 
00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
government with
 
00:53:42.549 --> 00:53:42.559 align:start position:0%
the hacking issues so um you know we are
 
00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
really working to
 
00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
train all of our staff to be vigilant
 
00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
for suspicious emails and other
 
00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh backdoor ways into the system and
 
00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:52.470 align:start position:0%
uh backdoor ways into the system and
enhancing

00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
enhancing
 
00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh protection of data and identity
 
00:53:56.230 --> 00:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
authentication for
 
00:53:57.990 --> 00:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
folks contacting us for benefit
 
00:53:59.670 --> 00:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
information um
 
00:54:01.829 --> 00:54:01.839 align:start position:0%
we've also over the last few years have
 
00:54:03.589 --> 00:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
been working to
 
00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
enhance our education and outreach for
 
00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
members employers and
 
00:54:09.670 --> 00:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
members of the public we've got uh
 
00:54:11.349 --> 00:54:11.359 align:start position:0%
various social media channels and a
 
00:54:11.359 --> 00:54:11.990 align:start position:0%
various social media channels and a
youtube

00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
youtube
 
00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
channel with nhrs presentations and we
 
00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
try to get out
 
00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
and tell our story to anyone who wants
 
00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
to listen
 
00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
um internally we're in the middle of a
 
00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
pension application system upgrade the
 
00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
product is called pension gold or pg
 
00:54:29.829 --> 00:54:29.839 align:start position:0%
and we're upgrading from version two to
 
00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
version three
 
00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh this is essentially the brain of the
 
00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
the retirement systems in terms of
 
00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:36.640 align:start position:0%
benefit application so this is a
 
00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:38.720 align:start position:0%
significant upgrade that's
 
00:54:42.309 --> 00:54:42.319 align:start position:0%
um moving in in phases over a period of
 
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
years we started in january of 19 and
 
00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:46.390 align:start position:0%
years we started in january of 19 and
we're

00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
um about a third of the way through the
 
00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
project the system that we're upgrading
 
00:54:52.309 --> 00:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
from was put in in 2003
 
00:54:55.349 --> 00:54:55.359 align:start position:0%
2004 and a lot of the uh server and
 
00:54:56.950 --> 00:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
other pieces of it are sort of reaching
 
00:54:58.470 --> 00:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
end of life so
 
00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
um it was it's moving within a product
 
00:55:03.349 --> 00:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
within the same vendor but still
 
00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:06.640 align:start position:0%
quite a quite a challenge um another new
 
00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
initiative is we just
 
00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
launched a contact center last month uh
 
00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
to sort of streamline
 
00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
calls from members and retirees in order
 
00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
to get them the information without
 
00:55:18.549 --> 00:55:18.559 align:start position:0%
sort of a phone tag or being being
 
00:55:20.069 --> 00:55:20.079 align:start position:0%
locked in voicemail
 
00:55:22.630 --> 00:55:22.640 align:start position:0%
so uh that's that's proceeding well so
 
00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:23.270 align:start position:0%
so uh that's that's proceeding well so
far

00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
far
 
00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
and um finally we're searching for a new
 
00:55:27.430 --> 00:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
executive director i know george will
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
talk about this um later but
 
00:55:32.549 --> 00:55:32.559 align:start position:0%
george is retiring from the retirement
 
00:55:34.309 --> 00:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
system at the end of next month
 
00:55:37.109 --> 00:55:37.119 align:start position:0%
um you announced that back in the fall
 
00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
and that search is ongoing
 
00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
and this is my last slide uh for this
 
00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:44.390 align:start position:0%
and this is my last slide uh for this
section

00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
um this is just sort of an overview of
 
00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
some significant developments since 2007
 
00:55:53.030 --> 00:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
and it's you know why 2007 it's it's 14
 
00:55:54.789 --> 00:55:54.799 align:start position:0%
years ago but this is really
 
00:55:57.109 --> 00:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
um the beginning of the the rebuild if
 
00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
you will for the new hampshire
 
00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
retirement system and the recognition
 
00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
among policy members and others that
 
00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
changes had to be made
 
00:56:07.589 --> 00:56:07.599 align:start position:0%
to strengthen the system and keep it
 
00:56:10.549 --> 00:56:10.559 align:start position:0%
viable going forward
 
00:56:12.549 --> 00:56:12.559 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest changes was a change
 
00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
in the actuarial methodology
 
00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
that was adopted in statute in 2007 uh
 
00:56:18.309 --> 00:56:18.319 align:start position:0%
we'll get
 
00:56:20.069 --> 00:56:20.079 align:start position:0%
kind of into the history of the unfunded
 
00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
liability of the pension system later
 
00:56:24.150 --> 00:56:24.160 align:start position:0%
but there was a actuarial methodology
 
00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
adopted in the early 90s
 
00:56:28.789 --> 00:56:28.799 align:start position:0%
that really undervalued valued the
 
00:56:30.069 --> 00:56:30.079 align:start position:0%
overvalued the plan
 
00:56:32.309 --> 00:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
and we weren't collecting uh the
 
00:56:33.829 --> 00:56:33.839 align:start position:0%
employer contributions we should for an
 
00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
extended period so that was fixed in
 
00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:37.109 align:start position:0%
extended period so that was fixed in
2007

00:56:37.109 --> 00:56:37.119 align:start position:0%
2007
 
00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh we created the legislature created an
 
00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
independent investment committee that
 
00:56:44.789 --> 00:56:44.799 align:start position:0%
which is performed better than peers
 
00:56:45.829 --> 00:56:45.839 align:start position:0%
over the last
 
00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
11 years since it was formed the
 
00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
legislature put in a 30-year
 
00:56:53.430 --> 00:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
amortization of our unfunded liability
 
00:56:55.829 --> 00:56:55.839 align:start position:0%
the board in a few instances over the
 
00:56:57.990 --> 00:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
years has reduced our assume rate of
 
00:57:00.309 --> 00:57:00.319 align:start position:0%
investment return which is a key driver
 
00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
of uh future costs and liabilities but
 
00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
um you know they were ratcheting it
 
00:57:06.309 --> 00:57:06.319 align:start position:0%
downwards to sort of reflect reality in
 
00:57:07.589 --> 00:57:07.599 align:start position:0%
the markets
 
00:57:11.349 --> 00:57:11.359 align:start position:0%
um and that's happened a few times
 
00:57:14.309 --> 00:57:14.319 align:start position:0%
2011 again that was my first year here
 
00:57:17.109 --> 00:57:17.119 align:start position:0%
uh house bill 2 was a significant change
 
00:57:18.789 --> 00:57:18.799 align:start position:0%
to the retirement system it was
 
00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
originally a standalone bill
 
00:57:22.470 --> 00:57:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh but was folded into house bill 2 in
 
00:57:25.349 --> 00:57:25.359 align:start position:0%
2011 uh did everything from increasing
 
00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
member contributions which are set in
 
00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:28.069 align:start position:0%
member contributions which are set in
statute

00:57:28.069 --> 00:57:28.079 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:57:30.390 --> 00:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh reduced benefit accruals and benefit
 
00:57:31.750 --> 00:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
formulas for
 
00:57:34.549 --> 00:57:34.559 align:start position:0%
uh non-vested members and future hires
 
00:57:34.559 --> 00:57:34.870 align:start position:0%
uh non-vested members and future hires
uh

00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:57:37.109 --> 00:57:37.119 align:start position:0%
changes the composition of our board
 
00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
eliminated the state employer
 
00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
contribution subsidy to
 
00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
local employers and made many other
 
00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:44.150 align:start position:0%
local employers and made many other
changes

00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
um some of those benefit and
 
00:57:47.589 --> 00:57:47.599 align:start position:0%
contribution changes were challenged in
 
00:57:50.309 --> 00:57:50.319 align:start position:0%
court uh both by labor groups and
 
00:57:52.789 --> 00:57:52.799 align:start position:0%
um you know by employers in regard to
 
00:57:54.789 --> 00:57:54.799 align:start position:0%
the to the state subsidy and in all
 
00:57:56.069 --> 00:57:56.079 align:start position:0%
those cases the
 
00:57:57.670 --> 00:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire supreme court in the
 
00:57:59.750 --> 00:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
series of decisions upheld
 
00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
the legislative changes and introduced
 
00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
into new hampshire law the
 
00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
unmistakability doctrine uh which uh
 
00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
states that if there wasn't a
 
00:58:11.829 --> 00:58:11.839 align:start position:0%
unmistakable intent of the legislature
 
00:58:12.789 --> 00:58:12.799 align:start position:0%
in an acting
 
00:58:15.589 --> 00:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
legislation future legislatures are
 
00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
allowed to change it prospectively
 
00:58:22.069 --> 00:58:22.079 align:start position:0%
uh and in 2017 uh there was what was
 
00:58:23.910 --> 00:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
called the decennial commission this was
 
00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
put into law back in 2007 as part of the
 
00:58:28.710 --> 00:58:28.720 align:start position:0%
pension changes and it's a 10-year
 
00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
look back at the retirement system on a
 
00:58:33.270 --> 00:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
panel consisting of
 
00:58:34.549 --> 00:58:34.559 align:start position:0%
representatives from the house and
 
00:58:36.549 --> 00:58:36.559 align:start position:0%
senate uh employers
 
00:58:38.309 --> 00:58:38.319 align:start position:0%
members retirees and members of the
 
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
public i believe uh
 
00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
chair mcguire was on the decennial
 
00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
commission uh you know and it was sort
 
00:58:44.630 --> 00:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
of a 360
 
00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
review went on for months and this is a
 
00:58:49.349 --> 00:58:49.359 align:start position:0%
lengthy report available on the
 
00:58:51.349 --> 00:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
general court website under the
 
00:58:53.829 --> 00:58:53.839 align:start position:0%
committee documents for this
 
00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
um you know it was a very thorough
 
00:58:57.750 --> 00:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
review of the retirement system and a
 
00:59:00.069 --> 00:59:00.079 align:start position:0%
number of recommendations were made
 
00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
um several of which were enacted into
 
00:59:04.870 --> 00:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
law as is or as modified
 
00:59:07.589 --> 00:59:07.599 align:start position:0%
you know through the legislative process
 
00:59:07.599 --> 00:59:08.230 align:start position:0%
you know through the legislative process
um

00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:08.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:11.109 --> 00:59:11.119 align:start position:0%
generally speaking the commission found
 
00:59:11.119 --> 00:59:11.430 align:start position:0%
generally speaking the commission found
that

00:59:11.430 --> 00:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:59:14.789 --> 00:59:14.799 align:start position:0%
nhrs was on the right track our costs
 
00:59:14.799 --> 00:59:16.710 align:start position:0%
nhrs was on the right track our costs
were

00:59:16.710 --> 00:59:16.720 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:59:19.829 --> 00:59:19.839 align:start position:0%
reasonable compared to other other
 
00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
plans around the country and our
 
00:59:22.470 --> 00:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
assumptions were among the more
 
00:59:24.309 --> 00:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
conservative at the time
 
00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
um well the commission also hired the
 
00:59:29.190 --> 00:59:29.200 align:start position:0%
center for retirement research in boston
 
00:59:31.349 --> 00:59:31.359 align:start position:0%
college to do an independent review and
 
00:59:33.190 --> 00:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
make recommendations for the retirement
 
00:59:34.950 --> 00:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
system and that sort of echoed
 
00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
the same findings um and then finally
 
00:59:41.270 --> 00:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
this past summer the board reduced our
 
00:59:44.069 --> 00:59:44.079 align:start position:0%
assumed rate of return to 6.75 and
 
00:59:45.990 --> 00:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
we'll address that in greater detail in
 
00:59:48.069 --> 00:59:48.079 align:start position:0%
the funding and contribution section
 
00:59:51.270 --> 00:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
that george and girardis are covering so
 
00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
at that this point i'm done for a little
 
00:59:54.630 --> 00:59:54.640 align:start position:0%
while and i'm gonna be turning it over
 
00:59:55.990 --> 00:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
to tim crutchfield
 
00:59:57.750 --> 00:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh to talk about membership and benefits
 
01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
so i'd be glad to take any questions
 
01:00:07.829 --> 01:00:07.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:11.829 --> 01:00:11.839 align:start position:0%
can you hear me yes
 
01:00:15.109 --> 01:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
would you repeat the mistake ability
 
01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
doctrine business
 
01:00:20.710 --> 01:00:20.720 align:start position:0%
yeah the uh unmistakably doctrine it
 
01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:20.950 align:start position:0%
yeah the uh unmistakably doctrine it
it's

01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:00:23.430 --> 01:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
it was it's a leak it can't other states
 
01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
have adopted it as well but the
 
01:00:27.270 --> 01:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire supreme court introduced
 
01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
it into new hampshire jurisprudence it
 
01:00:30.549 --> 01:00:30.559 align:start position:0%
basically says that
 
01:00:33.109 --> 01:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
unless there was an unmistakable intent
 
01:00:36.309 --> 01:00:36.319 align:start position:0%
in the legislation that that legislature
 
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
did not want that change going forward
 
01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
future legislatures
 
01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
had the right to to modify uh plan
 
01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:44.789 align:start position:0%
had the right to to modify uh plan
provisions

01:00:44.789 --> 01:00:44.799 align:start position:0%
provisions
 
01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:53.349 --> 01:00:53.359 align:start position:0%
marty how much uh by lowering the
 
01:00:55.270 --> 01:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh assumed rate of return from seven and
 
01:00:57.349 --> 01:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
a quarter to six and three quarters what
 
01:00:58.870 --> 01:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
did can you tell me what the effect was
 
01:00:59.349 --> 01:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:01:01.349 --> 01:01:01.359 align:start position:0%
unfunded accrued liability with that
 
01:01:02.549 --> 01:01:02.559 align:start position:0%
change yeah
 
01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:05.839 align:start position:0%
um that change in others um that were
 
01:01:05.839 --> 01:01:06.549 align:start position:0%
um that change in others um that were
adopted

01:01:06.549 --> 01:01:06.559 align:start position:0%
adopted
 
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with it such as payroll
 
01:01:10.789 --> 01:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
growth and demographic changes
 
01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
added about 900 million to the unfunded
 
01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:14.710 align:start position:0%
added about 900 million to the unfunded
liability

01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:14.720 align:start position:0%
liability
 
01:01:17.349 --> 01:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
um the lowering of the assume rate of
 
01:01:19.030 --> 01:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
return was by far the largest
 
01:01:21.589 --> 01:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
component of uh the increase but there
 
01:01:23.349 --> 01:01:23.359 align:start position:0%
were other changes that
 
01:01:25.510 --> 01:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
contributor added up together to make it
 
01:01:29.109 --> 01:01:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:48.069 --> 01:01:48.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:51.829 --> 01:01:51.839 align:start position:0%
don't see any other questions so if we
 
01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
okay i'll turn it over to tim
 
01:01:56.309 --> 01:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
crutchfield our deputy director
 
01:01:59.029 --> 01:01:59.039 align:start position:0%
thank you marty members of the committee
 
01:01:59.750 --> 01:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
01:02:01.589 --> 01:02:01.599 align:start position:0%
nice to see you again over the last 20
 
01:02:03.349 --> 01:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
years i've had the opportunity to appear
 
01:02:05.349 --> 01:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
before the committee numerous times and
 
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
it's always good to see some familiar
 
01:02:09.589 --> 01:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
faces and congratulations to the
 
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
new members of the committee as well i'm
 
01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
going to address the next
 
01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
five slides regarding membership and
 
01:02:17.029 --> 01:02:17.039 align:start position:0%
benefits and enrollment numbers and so
 
01:02:17.829 --> 01:02:17.839 align:start position:0%
forth and
 
01:02:19.589 --> 01:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
hopefully at least for the returning
 
01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
committee members some of these
 
01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
terms and and numbers and facts and
 
01:02:25.270 --> 01:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
figures will look familiar and
 
01:02:27.270 --> 01:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
i'm certainly happy to take questions
 
01:02:29.029 --> 01:02:29.039 align:start position:0%
along the way
 
01:02:32.549 --> 01:02:32.559 align:start position:0%
starting out uh by statute nhrs
 
01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
has broken the four member
 
01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
classifications into two groups
 
01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
group one being employees and teachers
 
01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
the teacher group the fire group and the
 
01:02:48.069 --> 01:02:48.079 align:start position:0%
police group
 
01:02:51.109 --> 01:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
are all mandatory participants again by
 
01:02:51.119 --> 01:02:52.230 align:start position:0%
are all mandatory participants again by
statute

01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
the employee groups can join
 
01:02:59.109 --> 01:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
nhrs if their participating employer
 
01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
elects it and
 
01:03:03.349 --> 01:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
certainly most of them have so if you
 
01:03:03.359 --> 01:03:03.990 align:start position:0%
certainly most of them have so if you
have

01:03:03.990 --> 01:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
you know a town or a city uh you know
 
01:03:07.829 --> 01:03:07.839 align:start position:0%
all their four
 
01:03:10.069 --> 01:03:10.079 align:start position:0%
member classifications within those two
 
01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
groups uh belong to nhrs
 
01:03:16.309 --> 01:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
as active members and
 
01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
as i said if you work full-time that
 
01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:19.589 align:start position:0%
as i said if you work full-time that
membership

01:03:19.589 --> 01:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
membership
 
01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
is mandatory you know there there are
 
01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:23.589 align:start position:0%
is mandatory you know there there are
exceptions

01:03:23.589 --> 01:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
exceptions
 
01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
to the rules and to the laws as most of
 
01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
you know so i'm just going to address
 
01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:27.750 align:start position:0%
you know so i'm just going to address
the

01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
the general terms of membership and
 
01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:31.990 align:start position:0%
the general terms of membership and
benefits

01:03:31.990 --> 01:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
so under the the bullet regarding the
 
01:03:37.270 --> 01:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
participating employers as you can see
 
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
there are 461
 
01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
participating employers everything from
 
01:03:45.349 --> 01:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
the state being the largest with about
 
01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
11 000
 
01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
participants to small tiny water
 
01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
districts and
 
01:03:55.349 --> 01:03:55.359 align:start position:0%
governmental entities that only have two
 
01:03:56.230 --> 01:03:56.240 align:start position:0%
or three
 
01:03:59.310 --> 01:03:59.320 align:start position:0%
members so it run it runs the gamut
 
01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:01.270 align:start position:0%
members so it run it runs the gamut
[Music]

01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:04:05.029 --> 01:04:05.039 align:start position:0%
moving on to slide 10 this shows some of
 
01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
the membership numbers between those
 
01:04:08.710 --> 01:04:08.720 align:start position:0%
four member classes
 
01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
as you can see the employee class makes
 
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
up a little more than 50 percent
 
01:04:15.829 --> 01:04:15.839 align:start position:0%
of our current total membership of about
 
01:04:15.839 --> 01:04:16.549 align:start position:0%
of our current total membership of about
48

01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
48
 
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
in the teacher group it's interesting as
 
01:04:25.270 --> 01:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
you probably know
 
01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
that's a group that is declining in
 
01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
terms of its demographics and its
 
01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:30.870 align:start position:0%
terms of its demographics and its
membership

01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
membership
 
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
numbers uh with the the enrollments of
 
01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
students declining across the state
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
police and fire make up relatively small
 
01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
percentages of
 
01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
the membership with police just a
 
01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
little less than five percent and fire
 
01:04:47.910 --> 01:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
only about two percent
 
01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:50.799 align:start position:0%
and you can see the retirees those
 
01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
numbers there as well
 
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
i will say that over the last seven
 
01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:56.319 align:start position:0%
years or so that
 
01:04:59.510 --> 01:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
active membership of about 48 000 has
 
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
remained relatively stable
 
01:05:04.309 --> 01:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
uh while the retiree group naturally we
 
01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
get more retirees every year and with
 
01:05:08.309 --> 01:05:08.319 align:start position:0%
folks living longer the number of
 
01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
retirees and beneficiaries is
 
01:05:13.270 --> 01:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
has increased i will reference
 
01:05:15.430 --> 01:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
a few slides during my presentation that
 
01:05:17.109 --> 01:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
are in the appendix that you may want to
 
01:05:19.029 --> 01:05:19.039 align:start position:0%
refer to
 
01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
in terms of the information on this
 
01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
slide i'll note that appendix slide
 
01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
38 provides a 10-year trend of
 
01:05:29.589 --> 01:05:29.599 align:start position:0%
of the numbers of both members and
 
01:05:29.599 --> 01:05:31.750 align:start position:0%
of the numbers of both members and
beneficiaries

01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries
 
01:05:34.829 --> 01:05:34.839 align:start position:0%
interestingly marty spoke about how in
 
01:05:34.839 --> 01:05:36.069 align:start position:0%
interestingly marty spoke about how in
1967

01:05:36.069 --> 01:05:36.079 align:start position:0%
1967
 
01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
nhrs was created by the legislature by
 
01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
merging four different
 
01:05:42.549 --> 01:05:42.559 align:start position:0%
retirement system plans and that first
 
01:05:42.559 --> 01:05:43.190 align:start position:0%
retirement system plans and that first
year

01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
there were 12 000 participants
 
01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
and 36 yes only 36 beneficiaries in 1967
 
01:05:53.430 --> 01:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
so the numbers have increased
 
01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:54.789 align:start position:0%
so the numbers have increased
significantly

01:05:54.789 --> 01:05:54.799 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
01:05:57.349 --> 01:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
uh and one thing that's uh i noted in
 
01:05:59.109 --> 01:05:59.119 align:start position:0%
listening to the bios of the committee
 
01:06:01.029 --> 01:06:01.039 align:start position:0%
members during the introductions is i
 
01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
think it
 
01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
it proves that there aren't six degrees
 
01:06:04.950 --> 01:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
of separation
 
01:06:07.349 --> 01:06:07.359 align:start position:0%
uh here in new hampshire between folks
 
01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
that you know
 
01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
have an impact have a vested interest in
 
01:06:11.829 --> 01:06:11.839 align:start position:0%
nhrs and
 
01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
in the lives it touches so it's we joke
 
01:06:15.829 --> 01:06:15.839 align:start position:0%
around the office that
 
01:06:17.589 --> 01:06:17.599 align:start position:0%
instead of six degrees of separation
 
01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
they're probably only about two
 
01:06:22.549 --> 01:06:22.559 align:start position:0%
you can also see that the average age of
 
01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
our active participants and the average
 
01:06:27.029 --> 01:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
age of our our beneficiaries and
 
01:06:28.549 --> 01:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
one thing i did want to point out is
 
01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
that average benefit
 
01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
of less than twenty one thousand dollars
 
01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
and sometimes the
 
01:06:37.109 --> 01:06:37.119 align:start position:0%
the headlines are the six figure uh
 
01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
annuities or benefits but
 
01:06:40.950 --> 01:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
you know the average of all those almost
 
01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
forty thousand people the average of
 
01:06:45.029 --> 01:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
less than twenty one thousand dollars i
 
01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
think would be modest
 
01:06:50.789 --> 01:06:50.799 align:start position:0%
by almost any standard uh moving on to
 
01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
slide 11. you can see the numbers there
 
01:06:54.789 --> 01:06:54.799 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
financial impact and outlay of the
 
01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
retirement system uh
 
01:07:02.470 --> 01:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
i just want to join the the first slide
 
01:07:04.990 --> 01:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
in the third slide so the
 
01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
816 almost 17 million dollars and
 
01:07:10.150 --> 01:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
benefits paid out 80 percent of that
 
01:07:12.549 --> 01:07:12.559 align:start position:0%
stays in new hampshire so i know my
 
01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
colleagues are always leery of me doing
 
01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
lawyer math but
 
01:07:18.549 --> 01:07:18.559 align:start position:0%
that's over 650 million dollars that
 
01:07:20.549 --> 01:07:20.559 align:start position:0%
stays in the state of new hampshire
 
01:07:22.470 --> 01:07:22.480 align:start position:0%
and has a significant impact on the new
 
01:07:25.029 --> 01:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
hampshire economy
 
01:07:27.190 --> 01:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
the middle bullet talks about a medical
 
01:07:28.789 --> 01:07:28.799 align:start position:0%
subsidy benefit
 
01:07:31.190 --> 01:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
that's a benefit available to
 
01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
essentially a closed pool
 
01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
of retirees that pays a a stipend if you
 
01:07:39.990 --> 01:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
will toward
 
01:07:42.390 --> 01:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
health insurance that's offered through
 
01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
retirees former employers
 
01:07:47.589 --> 01:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
there are about 10 000 retirees and
 
01:07:49.270 --> 01:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries that
 
01:07:51.589 --> 01:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
are covered under the medical subsidy
 
01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:54.079 align:start position:0%
now and as i said it's a closed group
 
01:07:57.829 --> 01:07:57.839 align:start position:0%
state employees had to have retired by
 
01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
july of 2004 teachers and political sub
 
01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
retirees had to retire by july of 2009
 
01:08:09.270 --> 01:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
and their for group twos police and fire
 
01:08:10.069 --> 01:08:10.079 align:start position:0%
they had to be
 
01:08:14.309 --> 01:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
active or retired uh by june of 2000 so
 
01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
again that that number of about 10 000
 
01:08:17.590 --> 01:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
folks now will only
 
01:08:20.709 --> 01:08:20.719 align:start position:0%
get smaller as time goes on
 
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
moving on now to slide 12.
 
01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
the four types of retirement service is
 
01:08:28.309 --> 01:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
by far
 
01:08:30.870 --> 01:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
you know the largest number of annuities
 
01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
that we pay out but
 
01:08:35.189 --> 01:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
we also offer a disability benefit and
 
01:08:37.189 --> 01:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
that's broken into two different
 
01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
types one is work related if you get
 
01:08:42.149 --> 01:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
hurt on the job as we refer to it as
 
01:08:44.550 --> 01:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
accidental disability retirement and
 
01:08:46.149 --> 01:08:46.159 align:start position:0%
then there's ordinary disability
 
01:08:46.159 --> 01:08:46.950 align:start position:0%
then there's ordinary disability
retirement

01:08:46.950 --> 01:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
you know you get sick or injured outside
 
01:08:51.749 --> 01:08:51.759 align:start position:0%
the workforce
 
01:08:54.070 --> 01:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
there's early retirement which is a
 
01:08:56.870 --> 01:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
combination of years of service and age
 
01:08:58.630 --> 01:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
i don't want to get too far down in the
 
01:09:00.309 --> 01:09:00.319 align:start position:0%
in the weeds but
 
01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
if you have say you're you're 50 years
 
01:09:06.390 --> 01:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
old and you have 30 years of service
 
01:09:08.309 --> 01:09:08.319 align:start position:0%
as a teacher you could qualify for
 
01:09:10.149 --> 01:09:10.159 align:start position:0%
what's referred to as an early service
 
01:09:10.159 --> 01:09:11.510 align:start position:0%
what's referred to as an early service
retirement

01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
which would normally be age 60 for the
 
01:09:15.749 --> 01:09:15.759 align:start position:0%
normal retirement age
 
01:09:18.070 --> 01:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
for those folks that do elect for early
 
01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
service retirement
 
01:09:22.149 --> 01:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
there is a reduction by taking early
 
01:09:23.590 --> 01:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
service as opposed to
 
01:09:26.950 --> 01:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
waiting until age 60.
 
01:09:30.630 --> 01:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
vested deferred retirement refers to
 
01:09:32.309 --> 01:09:32.319 align:start position:0%
a point of time in which a member
 
01:09:34.390 --> 01:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
qualifies for a benefit
 
01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
but they leave their participating
 
01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
employer before they actually
 
01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
retire so perhaps they have 20 years of
 
01:09:42.709 --> 01:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
service but they
 
01:09:44.229 --> 01:09:44.239 align:start position:0%
they leave and take another position
 
01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
with a non-participating employer
 
01:09:48.630 --> 01:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
so they have preserved the right to that
 
01:09:50.070 --> 01:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
benefit and
 
01:09:52.470 --> 01:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
when they get to age 60 or later in most
 
01:09:54.709 --> 01:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
cases and they want to utilize it then
 
01:09:56.709 --> 01:09:56.719 align:start position:0%
they can then apply for that vested
 
01:10:00.310 --> 01:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
deferred retirement benefit
 
01:10:02.070 --> 01:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
the next bullet refers to the different
 
01:10:04.630 --> 01:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
benefit provisions for the two groups
 
01:10:06.550 --> 01:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
again group one employees and teachers
 
01:10:09.030 --> 01:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
group two uh police and fire
 
01:10:10.870 --> 01:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
and and a large part of the the
 
01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
different benefit provisions
 
01:10:14.950 --> 01:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh have to do with the fact that group
 
01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:15.990 align:start position:0%
uh have to do with the fact that group
two

01:10:15.990 --> 01:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:10:18.390 --> 01:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
members do not have access to social
 
01:10:20.229 --> 01:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
security in new hampshire so you'll see
 
01:10:22.070 --> 01:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
some slides later on that shows
 
01:10:24.709 --> 01:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
the average group two benefit is higher
 
01:10:26.709 --> 01:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
than those for group one but
 
01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
in large part it's to make up for the
 
01:10:31.669 --> 01:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
lack of social security as well as they
 
01:10:32.709 --> 01:10:32.719 align:start position:0%
typically have a
 
01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
shorter work history due to the
 
01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:42.390 --> 01:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
the next bullet speaks to the different
 
01:10:44.070 --> 01:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
benefit provisions based on
 
01:10:47.669 --> 01:10:47.679 align:start position:0%
vested by or hired by date again vested
 
01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
vested in our terminology means at that
 
01:10:51.669 --> 01:10:51.679 align:start position:0%
point in which you're entitled to a
 
01:10:51.679 --> 01:10:52.470 align:start position:0%
point in which you're entitled to a
benefit

01:10:52.470 --> 01:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
01:10:56.709 --> 01:10:56.719 align:start position:0%
now marty mentioned hb2 back in 2011
 
01:10:58.790 --> 01:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
that established essentially two tiers
 
01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
of benefits for both groups and nhrs
 
01:11:05.110 --> 01:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
and it depends on if members were vested
 
01:11:10.870 --> 01:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
by uh 1 112 or hired prior to 7-1-11 and
 
01:11:14.229 --> 01:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
that created the two tiers
 
01:11:16.229 --> 01:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
there are different formulas for the
 
01:11:19.030 --> 01:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
benefits between group 1 and group 2.
 
01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
again i'll refer to the appendix under
 
01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:22.229 align:start position:0%
again i'll refer to the appendix under
slide

01:11:22.229 --> 01:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
slide
 
01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
40. it talks about or gives an example
 
01:11:29.110 --> 01:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
of a typical group one benefit
 
01:11:32.470 --> 01:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
slide 41 gives an example of a typical
 
01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
group two benefit uh by the the
 
01:11:37.030 --> 01:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
different components of what makes up
 
01:11:40.550 --> 01:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh a benefit the
 
01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
the months of creditable service the
 
01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
average final compensation and the
 
01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
benefit multiplier the
 
01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
creditable service is counted in terms
 
01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
of months for nhrs participants
 
01:11:54.149 --> 01:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
and again going back to that hired by or
 
01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
bested by date
 
01:11:58.550 --> 01:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh the the average final compensation
 
01:12:01.030 --> 01:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
is either based on an average of your
 
01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
high three years
 
01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
or or your high five years and again
 
01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
those slides 40 and 41 will give you an
 
01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
example of that
 
01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
moving now to slide 13.
 
01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
again i spoke earlier of the relatively
 
01:12:17.669 --> 01:12:17.679 align:start position:0%
modest benefits
 
01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
that nhrs pays its its
 
01:12:23.189 --> 01:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
retirees and beneficiaries i i think the
 
01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
numbers are right there for you
 
01:12:26.950 --> 01:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
again the the police and fire jump out
 
01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of the group one
 
01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh as being higher but again they they
 
01:12:32.550 --> 01:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
typically have a shorter
 
01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh work history and the the not
 
01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
entitled to social security
 
01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
the note on the automatic cost of living
 
01:12:46.630 --> 01:12:46.640 align:start position:0%
adjustments is interesting because those
 
01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
cost of living or
 
01:12:49.669 --> 01:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
cola adjustments are granted by the
 
01:12:52.390 --> 01:12:52.400 align:start position:0%
legislature last year a cola was granted
 
01:12:55.510 --> 01:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
for the first time since 2010
 
01:12:59.750 --> 01:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
that was 1.5 up to the first 50
 
01:13:03.630 --> 01:13:03.640 align:start position:0%
000 of a benefit so it was a maximum of
 
01:13:06.229 --> 01:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
750 dollars
 
01:13:10.870 --> 01:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
folks had to be retired uh since 7-1-14
 
01:13:13.510 --> 01:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
so that impacted about 30 000 out of the
 
01:13:15.590 --> 01:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
almost 40 000 retirees were then
 
01:13:17.110 --> 01:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
eligible for the cola
 
01:13:19.590 --> 01:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
it was phased in beginning this past
 
01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:20.790 align:start position:0%
it was phased in beginning this past
august

01:13:20.790 --> 01:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
august
 
01:13:23.990 --> 01:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
based on participants retirement month
 
01:13:26.229 --> 01:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
and so august through next july is how
 
01:13:28.149 --> 01:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
the this coming july is how the
 
01:13:31.270 --> 01:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
coals will be paid and the kohler was
 
01:13:33.830 --> 01:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
funded through employer contributions
 
01:13:36.950 --> 01:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh over the next 20 years at a cost of
 
01:13:37.669 --> 01:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
about 20
 
01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
67 million dollars through the general
 
01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:43.590 align:start position:0%
67 million dollars through the general
fund

01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:48.709 --> 01:13:48.719 align:start position:0%
moving on to slide 14 my last slide
 
01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
again i spoke briefly about perhaps
 
01:13:54.550 --> 01:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
the six figure the rare six figure
 
01:13:56.310 --> 01:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
benefits get the headlines but as you
 
01:13:58.390 --> 01:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
can see the vast majority
 
01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
of our retirees and beneficiaries
 
01:14:03.350 --> 01:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
aren't getting rich on their nhrs
 
01:14:04.950 --> 01:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
retirements uh
 
01:14:08.149 --> 01:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
you know with 28 percent or about 11 000
 
01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
of our 48 or 39 000
 
01:14:13.189 --> 01:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
make less than 10 thousand dollars a
 
01:14:15.189 --> 01:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
year in their retirement annuity
 
01:14:17.270 --> 01:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh you know two-thirds are under
 
01:14:19.189 --> 01:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
twenty-five thousand dollars
 
01:14:22.149 --> 01:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
uh and ninety-four percent make less
 
01:14:24.070 --> 01:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
than the fifty thousand so again
 
01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
um they work uh they earn it uh they're
 
01:14:28.950 --> 01:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
not getting rich by their retirement
 
01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:30.709 align:start position:0%
not getting rich by their retirement
benefit

01:14:30.709 --> 01:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
01:14:32.550 --> 01:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
an average benefit of less than twenty
 
01:14:35.510 --> 01:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
one thousand dollars
 
01:14:37.510 --> 01:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
that concludes my portion of the
 
01:14:39.270 --> 01:14:39.280 align:start position:0%
presentation i'm happy to take any
 
01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
questions before turning it over to
 
01:14:42.390 --> 01:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
larry johansen to discuss
 
01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:47.590 align:start position:0%
larry johansen to discuss
investments

01:14:47.590 --> 01:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:51.910 --> 01:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:54.550 --> 01:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i thank you tim
 
01:14:56.070 --> 01:14:56.080 align:start position:0%
for your presentation
 
01:14:59.830 --> 01:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
good to see you again um i'm wondering
 
01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
i recall during the time
 
01:15:08.229 --> 01:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
roughly at the very beginning of the
 
01:15:11.270 --> 01:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
restructuring of the retirement system
 
01:15:14.470 --> 01:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
that was undertaken as a result of
 
01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
house bill what was it 683 or something
 
01:15:18.149 --> 01:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
like that
 
01:15:24.790 --> 01:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
um that got into a whole series of the
 
01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
the decisions that have been taken back
 
01:15:28.229 --> 01:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
in the 90s that
 
01:15:30.790 --> 01:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
had resulted in kind of a devastating
 
01:15:32.550 --> 01:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
diminution of the
 
01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
the trust fund corpus
 
01:15:40.470 --> 01:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
and and and some unsustainable long-term
 
01:15:43.350 --> 01:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
programs uh given the financial status
 
01:15:44.310 --> 01:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:15:47.669 --> 01:15:47.679 align:start position:0%
retirement system uh so the colas
 
01:15:51.430 --> 01:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
and the uh the the healthcare subsidies
 
01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
which were basically kind of
 
01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:55.830 align:start position:0%
which were basically kind of
discontinued

01:15:55.830 --> 01:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
discontinued
 
01:15:59.110 --> 01:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
uh except for uh the the
 
01:16:01.110 --> 01:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
health care benefit which was continued
 
01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
for those people that were contractually
 
01:16:06.870 --> 01:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
entitled to it uh but there were a lot
 
01:16:09.189 --> 01:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
of people that came and testified
 
01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
with regard to their status and so forth
 
01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:12.310 align:start position:0%
with regard to their status and so forth
and

01:16:12.310 --> 01:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:16:14.470 --> 01:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
uh and i remember seeing a lot of those
 
01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:15.350 align:start position:0%
uh and i remember seeing a lot of those
people

01:16:15.350 --> 01:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:16:18.790 --> 01:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
um many of them had been retired for
 
01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:20.719 align:start position:0%
many years and were
 
01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
the the red hat ladies you probably saw
 
01:16:23.910 --> 01:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
them yourself
 
01:16:27.189 --> 01:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
uh who came in um and
 
01:16:29.430 --> 01:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of those people were in their high
 
01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
80s and 90s and some even older
 
01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
who had been retired for decades uh
 
01:16:38.790 --> 01:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
but um but they also had been
 
01:16:42.229 --> 01:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
uh working at a time when their earnings
 
01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
were very very low
 
01:16:46.229 --> 01:16:46.239 align:start position:0%
so the figure that you on the screen
 
01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
that you're showing us
 
01:16:49.270 --> 01:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
the annual benefit under ten thousand
 
01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:50.310 align:start position:0%
the annual benefit under ten thousand
dollars

01:16:50.310 --> 01:16:50.320 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:16:53.510 --> 01:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
28 of the people so
 
01:16:55.590 --> 01:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
is that basically those are the people
 
01:16:57.350 --> 01:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
who are who've been in the retirement
 
01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:58.229 align:start position:0%
who are who've been in the retirement
system

01:16:58.229 --> 01:16:58.239 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
for in many cases decades now
 
01:17:03.110 --> 01:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
most of many of them would have passed
 
01:17:04.470 --> 01:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
away in the meantime
 
01:17:07.350 --> 01:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
but others you know have aged into that
 
01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:08.229 align:start position:0%
but others you know have aged into that
status

01:17:08.229 --> 01:17:08.239 align:start position:0%
status
 
01:17:12.709 --> 01:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
um so they uh these are people who
 
01:17:16.310 --> 01:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
actually had very very low earnings
 
01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
was that not the case and that so that
 
01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
the figure
 
01:17:24.550 --> 01:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
of under 10 000 um
 
01:17:27.750 --> 01:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
is it has to be understood in
 
01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of who those people are is that
 
01:17:31.350 --> 01:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
not correct
 
01:17:33.910 --> 01:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative schmidt i i
 
01:17:34.630 --> 01:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
would offer
 
01:17:37.030 --> 01:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
a little different perspective that
 
01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:37.750 align:start position:0%
a little different perspective that
certainly

01:17:37.750 --> 01:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:17:40.709 --> 01:17:40.719 align:start position:0%
there probably are a few older much
 
01:17:42.149 --> 01:17:42.159 align:start position:0%
older folks who
 
01:17:44.790 --> 01:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
worked a traditional working career but
 
01:17:46.630 --> 01:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
because of the earnings at that time
 
01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
resulted in a very low pension but more
 
01:17:51.430 --> 01:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
likely i suggest that the
 
01:17:54.310 --> 01:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
uh the 10 000 a year or less are folks
 
01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:54.870 align:start position:0%
uh the 10 000 a year or less are folks
who

01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:17:57.110 --> 01:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
didn't have a long career didn't have a
 
01:17:58.950 --> 01:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
30-year teacher career or
 
01:18:01.590 --> 01:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
20-year public safety career that
 
01:18:03.030 --> 01:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps they only worked
 
01:18:04.870 --> 01:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
five or six years but they kept kept
 
01:18:06.790 --> 01:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
their money in and then they
 
01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
you know then when they aged into it age
 
01:18:11.590 --> 01:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
60 or 65 as the case may be they started
 
01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:12.149 align:start position:0%
60 or 65 as the case may be they started
collecting

01:18:12.149 --> 01:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
collecting
 
01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
it so i would suggest it's probably more
 
01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:15.669 align:start position:0%
it so i would suggest it's probably more
representative

01:18:15.669 --> 01:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
of a fewer years of service than
 
01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
a traditional long working career at a
 
01:18:22.950 --> 01:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
low wage
 
01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
i think that's very helpful to make that
 
01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:26.070 align:start position:0%
i think that's very helpful to make that
uh

01:18:26.070 --> 01:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:18:29.669 --> 01:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
distinction um because
 
01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
the the brand new members of the
 
01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
committee who are seeing all this
 
01:18:34.950 --> 01:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
information for the first time
 
01:18:38.470 --> 01:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh will have a hard time understanding
 
01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:39.030 align:start position:0%
uh will have a hard time understanding
that

01:18:39.030 --> 01:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:42.550 --> 01:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
now how are you going to help
 
01:18:45.750 --> 01:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
all of us try to recover uh from
 
01:18:48.149 --> 01:18:48.159 align:start position:0%
you know six months of enforced uh
 
01:18:48.159 --> 01:18:49.189 align:start position:0%
you know six months of enforced uh
absence

01:18:49.189 --> 01:18:49.199 align:start position:0%
absence
 
01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
and inactivity in the legislature to to
 
01:18:54.149 --> 01:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
deal with these situations
 
01:18:56.310 --> 01:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
and the people who are brand new unless
 
01:18:57.669 --> 01:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
they're in the retirement system
 
01:18:57.679 --> 01:19:00.070 align:start position:0%
they're in the retirement system
themselves

01:19:00.070 --> 01:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
01:19:01.990 --> 01:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
i don't have any knowledge of this is
 
01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
there going to be some
 
01:19:07.990 --> 01:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
like manuals and so forth so people
 
01:19:12.390 --> 01:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
can study this in in more detail
 
01:19:13.990 --> 01:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
that could be provided to the committee
 
01:19:16.709 --> 01:19:16.719 align:start position:0%
members we certainly can and i'll defer
 
01:19:16.719 --> 01:19:17.510 align:start position:0%
members we certainly can and i'll defer
to

01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:19:20.149 --> 01:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
both marty and george but we'll make
 
01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
this information and certainly this
 
01:19:24.790 --> 01:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
uh presentation on the slides available
 
01:19:26.550 --> 01:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh if we haven't already immediately
 
01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
following the conclusion of today's
 
01:19:29.910 --> 01:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
meeting at any time there's a question
 
01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:30.790 align:start position:0%
meeting at any time there's a question
from

01:19:30.790 --> 01:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:19:33.750 --> 01:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
any of you are happy to answer it and
 
01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
provide the information
 
01:19:38.070 --> 01:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
in whatever form you deem best
 
01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt this is marty
 
01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
carlin if i i can jump in i think
 
01:19:43.110 --> 01:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
i might have mentioned this while tim
 
01:19:44.870 --> 01:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
was transitioning into the
 
01:19:48.790 --> 01:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
participant phase but i i did send pam a
 
01:19:50.470 --> 01:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
series of links to all of our annual
 
01:19:51.990 --> 01:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
financial reports
 
01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
uh and some other handouts and
 
01:19:55.270 --> 01:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
supplemental material that
 
01:19:57.430 --> 01:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh would be useful background for the
 
01:19:59.350 --> 01:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
committee to to look at and we can we
 
01:20:01.110 --> 01:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
can definitely if there's
 
01:20:03.510 --> 01:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
additional information that's available
 
01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
we can provide that on request but
 
01:20:07.350 --> 01:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
um i would point out the annual
 
01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
financial report
 
01:20:12.310 --> 01:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
uh is has a lot of data in it it's um
 
01:20:15.350 --> 01:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
unlike a sort of a news article with an
 
01:20:16.950 --> 01:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
inverted pyramid all the
 
01:20:18.629 --> 01:20:18.639 align:start position:0%
the better information in the annual
 
01:20:20.470 --> 01:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
report is towards the back it's all sort
 
01:20:22.390 --> 01:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
of the statistical and data information
 
01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:23.110 align:start position:0%
of the statistical and data information
it's

01:20:23.110 --> 01:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:20:25.189 --> 01:20:25.199 align:start position:0%
formatted in such a way that the i cut
 
01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
to meet the accounting standards
 
01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
the summary uh financial report is only
 
01:20:31.669 --> 01:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
about 10 pages and that's a really
 
01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
quick reference to a lot of high-level
 
01:20:35.350 --> 01:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
information on the retirement system and
 
01:20:36.629 --> 01:20:36.639 align:start position:0%
i'd recommend
 
01:20:41.669 --> 01:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
uh checking that out as well
 
01:20:44.830 --> 01:20:44.840 align:start position:0%

stuart i i don't want to sound like a
 
01:21:33.229 --> 01:21:33.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:33.239 --> 01:21:37.750 align:start position:0%
 
www.nhrs.org

01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:42.709 --> 01:21:42.719 align:start position:0%
thank you very much further hand so
 
01:21:44.310 --> 01:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
please continue
 
01:21:46.870 --> 01:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
uh yes wait i have a question can you
 
01:21:48.310 --> 01:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
hear me
 
01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
yes sir representative please ask
 
01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh first of you're talking about people
 
01:21:57.830 --> 01:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
getting an average benefit of under 10k
 
01:21:57.840 --> 01:21:58.229 align:start position:0%
getting an average benefit of under 10k
you

01:21:58.229 --> 01:21:58.239 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:22:00.870 --> 01:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
said i thought i heard you say people
 
01:22:02.070 --> 01:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
have left their money in
 
01:22:04.390 --> 01:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
for only four or five years and left i
 
01:22:06.229 --> 01:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
thought you needed to take 10 years to
 
01:22:08.470 --> 01:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
get vested
 
01:22:10.709 --> 01:22:10.719 align:start position:0%
or that is if you're 10 years you just
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
get your money back
 
01:22:16.470 --> 01:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
if you stayed less than 10 you could get
 
01:22:17.590 --> 01:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
your money back
 
01:22:19.669 --> 01:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
if you stay 10 that's typically the the
 
01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
magic figure from
 
01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
many folks who are participating now
 
01:22:24.229 --> 01:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
that they would then become
 
01:22:27.270 --> 01:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
vested i.e entitled to a benefit the
 
01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
other way
 
01:22:30.870 --> 01:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
to be vested and be entitled to a
 
01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:31.430 align:start position:0%
to be vested and be entitled to a
benefit

01:22:31.430 --> 01:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
01:22:34.790 --> 01:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
is to age in meaning if you started
 
01:22:37.350 --> 01:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
a a career or a second career for a
 
01:22:39.030 --> 01:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
participating employer
 
01:22:41.430 --> 01:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
at age 55 for example and you worked
 
01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
until age 60 by hitting age
 
01:22:46.070 --> 01:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
60 even though you only had five years
 
01:22:46.790 --> 01:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
of service
 
01:22:49.990 --> 01:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
you would also be entitled to a benefit
 
01:22:51.830 --> 01:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
so this would not work for somebody who
 
01:22:53.590 --> 01:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
was 20 years old
 
01:22:56.629 --> 01:22:56.639 align:start position:0%
and left their five years
 
01:22:58.470 --> 01:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
correct they would not be entitled to a
 
01:23:00.470 --> 01:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
benefit thank you
 
01:23:08.709 --> 01:23:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:10.790 --> 01:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you good morning and it's uh
 
01:23:11.910 --> 01:23:11.920 align:start position:0%

at a very high level the
 
01:23:23.110 --> 01:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
responsibilities is
 
01:23:25.910 --> 01:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
is broadly distributed between the board
 
01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
of trustees a
 
01:23:31.110 --> 01:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
13-member board representing employers
 
01:23:34.870 --> 01:23:34.880 align:start position:0%

the investment policy including the
 
01:23:38.310 --> 01:23:38.320 align:start position:0%

they hire the service providers the
 
01:24:12.229 --> 01:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
asset managers
 
01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
they hire the consultants and or the
 
01:24:18.229 --> 01:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
custodian rather and they prepare as as
 
01:24:19.590 --> 01:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
was alluded to earlier
 
01:24:22.550 --> 01:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
a comprehensive annual investment report
 
01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
that was just
 
01:24:26.709 --> 01:24:26.719 align:start position:0%
finished and is is posted on our website
 
01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
um in appendix on slide 36
 
01:24:33.270 --> 01:24:33.280 align:start position:0%
is a list of the current members of the
 
01:24:35.110 --> 01:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
investment committee it's a six-member
 
01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:37.030 align:start position:0%
investment committee it's a six-member
committee

01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:24:38.950 --> 01:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
two from the board appointed by the
 
01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
board chair three independent members
 
01:24:43.830 --> 01:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
and then a member who is a member of the
 
01:24:45.430 --> 01:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
retirement system
 
01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:51.990 --> 01:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
this is our asset allocation we look at
 
01:24:54.340 --> 01:24:54.350 align:start position:0%
this continuously
 
01:24:54.350 --> 01:24:55.510 align:start position:0%
this continuously

[Music]
 
01:24:58.629 --> 01:24:58.639 align:start position:0%
we have a very long-term horizon um
 
01:25:01.750 --> 01:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
25 plus years you think about a
 
01:25:04.950 --> 01:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
new member of the retirement system 20
 
01:25:06.709 --> 01:25:06.719 align:start position:0%
years plus or minus
 
01:25:09.830 --> 01:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
retires at 65
 
01:25:12.550 --> 01:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
and then and then lives another 20-plus
 
01:25:14.229 --> 01:25:14.239 align:start position:0%
years in retirement that's a very
 
01:25:15.990 --> 01:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
long-term horizon
 
01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
we continuously manage risk and
 
01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:19.270 align:start position:0%
we continuously manage risk and
liquidity

01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
liquidity
 
01:25:22.390 --> 01:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
one of the things that that we did when
 
01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:22.790 align:start position:0%
one of the things that that we did when
the

01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:25:26.470 --> 01:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
um pandemic first started is managed
 
01:25:29.110 --> 01:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
our cash needs over a 90-day basis as
 
01:25:31.350 --> 01:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
opposed to a 30-day basis
 
01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
we have a modest negative cash flow in
 
01:25:35.669 --> 01:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
the retirement system
 
01:25:37.910 --> 01:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
meaning that when you add up all of the
 
01:25:40.310 --> 01:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
member and employer contributions
 
01:25:42.790 --> 01:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
that's slightly less than or yeah
 
01:25:44.470 --> 01:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
slightly less than the
 
01:25:46.070 --> 01:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
benefit payments that are paid so we
 
01:25:48.550 --> 01:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
need to manage that very carefully
 
01:25:50.950 --> 01:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
when when the pandemic first started and
 
01:25:52.950 --> 01:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
the economic impact and you will all
 
01:25:53.910 --> 01:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
recall the
 
01:25:56.149 --> 01:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
significant downturn in march of last
 
01:25:58.229 --> 01:25:58.239 align:start position:0%
year we wanted to make sure that we had
 
01:25:59.510 --> 01:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
sufficient cash
 
01:26:02.070 --> 01:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
to meet benefit payments every month um
 
01:26:04.629 --> 01:26:04.639 align:start position:0%
it's a well-diversified portfolio you
 
01:26:05.590 --> 01:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
can see
 
01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
that all of the asset classes are
 
01:26:11.990 --> 01:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
close to targets and well within the
 
01:26:14.550 --> 01:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
range as part of the asset allocation
 
01:26:16.629 --> 01:26:16.639 align:start position:0%
that the board adopts recommended by the
 
01:26:17.910 --> 01:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
investment committee
 
01:26:19.830 --> 01:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
there's a target allocation but then a
 
01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
range around that so you're not
 
01:26:25.110 --> 01:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
doing a round trip to try to get back to
 
01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:25.830 align:start position:0%
doing a round trip to try to get back to
it

01:26:25.830 --> 01:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
within a very narrow range on the next
 
01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:30.550 align:start position:0%
within a very narrow range on the next
slide

01:26:30.550 --> 01:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
slide
 
01:26:33.110 --> 01:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
these are our returns at june 30.
 
01:26:35.030 --> 01:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
obviously the one-year return was
 
01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:36.709 align:start position:0%
obviously the one-year return was
dramatically

01:26:36.709 --> 01:26:36.719 align:start position:0%
dramatically
 
01:26:40.870 --> 01:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
impacted by the economic impact of the
 
01:26:43.990 --> 01:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
pandemic primarily in the first quarter
 
01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:44.709 align:start position:0%
pandemic primarily in the first quarter
of

01:26:44.709 --> 01:26:44.719 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
2020 but there was some recovery in the
 
01:26:49.830 --> 01:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
second quarter but not
 
01:26:53.830 --> 01:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
complete longer term returns are listed
 
01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:54.629 align:start position:0%
complete longer term returns are listed
here

01:26:54.629 --> 01:26:54.639 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:26:57.030 --> 01:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
i would point out that at the board
 
01:26:59.350 --> 01:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
meeting yesterday we reviewed
 
01:27:02.629 --> 01:27:02.639 align:start position:0%
performance through november 30th
 
01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
um the performance has dramatically
 
01:27:07.189 --> 01:27:07.199 align:start position:0%
rebounded since
 
01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
the end of the fiscal year 14.2
 
01:27:13.270 --> 01:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
for the five months ending uh november
 
01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:14.149 align:start position:0%
for the five months ending uh november
30th

01:27:14.149 --> 01:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
30th
 
01:27:16.070 --> 01:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
and then on a longer term basis for
 
01:27:18.229 --> 01:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
three years 7.1
 
01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
five years 8.7 and 10 years 8.6 so
 
01:27:26.070 --> 01:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
the economic impact for the first two
 
01:27:26.790 --> 01:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
quarters of
 
01:27:30.790 --> 01:27:30.800 align:start position:0%
2020 have turned around significantly
 
01:27:33.669 --> 01:27:33.679 align:start position:0%
again the assumed rate of return is 6.75
 
01:27:35.350 --> 01:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
over the long term
 
01:27:39.750 --> 01:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
we want to exceed that next slide please
 
01:27:41.910 --> 01:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
this is the annual returns over long
 
01:27:43.910 --> 01:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
periods of time
 
01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
one of the things that this slide is is
 
01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
very helpful in pointing out is
 
01:27:51.510 --> 01:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
why we do asset smoothing over five
 
01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:52.629 align:start position:0%
why we do asset smoothing over five
years

01:27:52.629 --> 01:27:52.639 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:27:55.350 --> 01:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
the rate setting valuations are in the
 
01:27:56.550 --> 01:27:56.560 align:start position:0%
odd year
 
01:27:59.110 --> 01:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
if we didn't smooth the valuation as of
 
01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:00.229 align:start position:0%
if we didn't smooth the valuation as of
009

01:28:00.229 --> 01:28:00.239 align:start position:0%
009
 
01:28:02.470 --> 01:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
would have resulted in a dramatic
 
01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:03.430 align:start position:0%
would have resulted in a dramatic
increase

01:28:03.430 --> 01:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
increase
 
01:28:05.830 --> 01:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
in employer contribution rates and then
 
01:28:07.669 --> 01:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
two years later and 11
 
01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
with that very spike and positive
 
01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:10.950 align:start position:0%
with that very spike and positive
performance

01:28:10.950 --> 01:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
performance
 
01:28:12.629 --> 01:28:12.639 align:start position:0%
obviously those employer rates would
 
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
have dropped dramatically so so the
 
01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:16.310 align:start position:0%
have dropped dramatically so so the
smoothing

01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
smoothing
 
01:28:19.590 --> 01:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
helps um keep contribution rates
 
01:28:22.790 --> 01:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
relatively stable over time next slide
 
01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:25.030 align:start position:0%
relatively stable over time next slide
please

01:28:25.030 --> 01:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:28:26.709 --> 01:28:26.719 align:start position:0%
one of the things marty alluded to
 
01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
earlier is the development of the
 
01:28:30.229 --> 01:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
independent investment committee
 
01:28:32.070 --> 01:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
dramatically improved performance for
 
01:28:33.669 --> 01:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
the retirement system since its
 
01:28:33.679 --> 01:28:34.790 align:start position:0%
the retirement system since its
inception

01:28:34.790 --> 01:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
inception
 
01:28:37.270 --> 01:28:37.280 align:start position:0%
over the past 10 years our investment
 
01:28:39.030 --> 01:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
performance has been better than 9
 
01:28:42.790 --> 01:28:42.800 align:start position:0%
74 of our peers meaning we're almost
 
01:28:46.229 --> 01:28:46.239 align:start position:0%
in the top quartile since the inception
 
01:28:49.669 --> 01:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
the investment committee has um created
 
01:28:52.390 --> 01:28:52.400 align:start position:0%
to approximately 270 million dollars
 
01:28:53.189 --> 01:28:53.199 align:start position:0%
more than
 
01:28:57.430 --> 01:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
um had we earned the average return of
 
01:29:00.709 --> 01:29:00.719 align:start position:0%
of the peers um one other slide i would
 
01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
point to you in the
 
01:29:05.110 --> 01:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
appendix is slide 42 in addition to
 
01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:06.070 align:start position:0%
appendix is slide 42 in addition to
managing

01:29:06.070 --> 01:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
managing
 
01:29:08.709 --> 01:29:08.719 align:start position:0%
the assets we are very cognizant of
 
01:29:10.550 --> 01:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
managing our expenses
 
01:29:15.110 --> 01:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
slide 42 demonstrates that our
 
01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
expenses on investments are dramatically
 
01:29:19.270 --> 01:29:19.280 align:start position:0%
less than peers
 
01:29:21.110 --> 01:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
it also demonstrates that our
 
01:29:22.950 --> 01:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
administrative expenses the
 
01:29:25.030 --> 01:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
cost of running the retirement system
 
01:29:26.870 --> 01:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
are dramatically less than
 
01:29:30.310 --> 01:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
peers before i turn this over to
 
01:29:32.709 --> 01:29:32.719 align:start position:0%
gerard for the next slide of slides are
 
01:29:34.629 --> 01:29:34.639 align:start position:0%
there any questions from the
 
01:29:41.910 --> 01:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:44.149 --> 01:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
yes i had my hand raised this is uh
 
01:29:45.910 --> 01:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
representative shewett
 
01:29:49.669 --> 01:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
um i'm curious you mentioned
 
01:29:51.990 --> 01:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
the specific return for the first
 
01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:52.950 align:start position:0%
the specific return for the first
quarter

01:29:52.950 --> 01:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
quarter
 
01:29:56.470 --> 01:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
of 2020 what was the return for the
 
01:29:57.669 --> 01:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
second quarter
 
01:30:00.310 --> 01:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
and was that just for the or was that
 
01:30:01.030 --> 01:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
for the first
 
01:30:03.590 --> 01:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
six months and what was the actual
 
01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:04.870 align:start position:0%
six months and what was the actual
percentage

01:30:04.870 --> 01:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
percentage
 
01:30:07.110 --> 01:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
i i don't have that representative off
 
01:30:08.390 --> 01:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
the top of my head
 
01:30:10.629 --> 01:30:10.639 align:start position:0%
the the return for the first quarter of
 
01:30:12.550 --> 01:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
2020 was a negative return
 
01:30:15.430 --> 01:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
it was slightly positive for the second
 
01:30:16.950 --> 01:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
quarter of 2020.
 
01:30:19.189 --> 01:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
um the the total return for the fiscal
 
01:30:20.870 --> 01:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
year was 1.1
 
01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
but as a follow-up we can certainly send
 
01:30:24.870 --> 01:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
the committee that information
 
01:30:27.430 --> 01:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr johansen please
 
01:30:29.510 --> 01:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
do send us that information
 
01:30:33.510 --> 01:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
because the way the markets have been
 
01:30:36.629 --> 01:30:36.639 align:start position:0%
whipsawed we we are we're interested to
 
01:30:37.350 --> 01:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
see what's
 
01:30:44.310 --> 01:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:48.790 --> 01:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
thank you uh madam chair before before
 
01:30:51.270 --> 01:30:51.280 align:start position:0%
before i get into this um can you repeat
 
01:30:53.669 --> 01:30:53.679 align:start position:0%
that number that you said
 
01:30:57.350 --> 01:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
was it 14.2
 
01:30:59.590 --> 01:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
i wrote down end of november 30th is
 
01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:00.870 align:start position:0%
i wrote down end of november 30th is
that

01:31:00.870 --> 01:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
that's for the five months ending
 
01:31:04.149 --> 01:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
november 30th
 
01:31:07.830 --> 01:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
okay so my my question is this because
 
01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:11.590 align:start position:0%
okay so my my question is this because
my

01:31:11.590 --> 01:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:13.350 --> 01:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
my concern is with the investment
 
01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
committee we
 
01:31:17.510 --> 01:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
my understanding is it used to meet
 
01:31:20.070 --> 01:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
quarterly that changed
 
01:31:23.110 --> 01:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
to a more frequent time period
 
01:31:26.790 --> 01:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
the the act the actions
 
01:31:29.669 --> 01:31:29.679 align:start position:0%
in the market um and and to give you a
 
01:31:31.350 --> 01:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
bit of my background
 
01:31:33.110 --> 01:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
on that so where i'm coming from is my
 
01:31:34.790 --> 01:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
frame of reference i had a
 
01:31:36.629 --> 01:31:36.639 align:start position:0%
talking baby on a television convinced
 
01:31:38.470 --> 01:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
me to download an app
 
01:31:40.870 --> 01:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
eight years ago and start investing in
 
01:31:42.149 --> 01:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
my spare time
 
01:31:44.550 --> 01:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
i buy no means am someone that is
 
01:31:45.910 --> 01:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
qualified to
 
01:31:49.510 --> 01:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
give anybody any investing advice okay
 
01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
but me goofing around has pulled
 
01:31:56.310 --> 01:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
easily double digit numbers um
 
01:31:59.350 --> 01:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
you know over this time period in in
 
01:32:00.790 --> 01:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
doing a little you know personal
 
01:32:02.390 --> 01:32:02.400 align:start position:0%
investing in
 
01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
you know just just like i said very
 
01:32:06.229 --> 01:32:06.239 align:start position:0%
rudimentary amateur
 
01:32:08.790 --> 01:32:08.800 align:start position:0%
you know looking at the way the market
 
01:32:10.870 --> 01:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
moved the market didn't fall off a cliff
 
01:32:13.669 --> 01:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
the market slid
 
01:32:16.950 --> 01:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
from december of 19 through april and
 
01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:18.470 align:start position:0%
from december of 19 through april and
may

01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
may
 
01:32:20.229 --> 01:32:20.239 align:start position:0%
now with the new hampshire retirement
 
01:32:22.070 --> 01:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
system having an investment committee
 
01:32:25.110 --> 01:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
and having paid professionals
 
01:32:29.030 --> 01:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
looking at the allocation of assets
 
01:32:30.950 --> 01:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
within the retirement system
 
01:32:34.070 --> 01:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
what moves did the retirement
 
01:32:37.430 --> 01:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
system make while that slide was
 
01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:39.189 align:start position:0%
system make while that slide was
occurring

01:32:39.189 --> 01:32:39.199 align:start position:0%
occurring
 
01:32:40.870 --> 01:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
because if we just sat there and watched
 
01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:42.719 align:start position:0%
it happen
 
01:32:44.229 --> 01:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
i got a 10 year old nephew that can do
 
01:32:44.239 --> 01:32:45.910 align:start position:0%
i got a 10 year old nephew that can do
that

01:32:45.910 --> 01:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:32:47.830 --> 01:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
you know we're paying professionals to
 
01:32:49.750 --> 01:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
to make moves
 
01:32:51.430 --> 01:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
in reaction to what is currently
 
01:32:52.870 --> 01:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
happening and
 
01:32:54.870 --> 01:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
i think the question that really needs
 
01:32:57.430 --> 01:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
to be answered is what moves were made
 
01:33:00.229 --> 01:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
so you can help restore some confidence
 
01:33:01.110 --> 01:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
in this
 
01:33:03.910 --> 01:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
in this committee um that the investment
 
01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:04.870 align:start position:0%
in this committee um that the investment
committee

01:33:04.870 --> 01:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:33:09.510 --> 01:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
is actually doing anything
 
01:33:12.470 --> 01:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
well first the the investment committee
 
01:33:14.390 --> 01:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned was created in
 
01:33:17.990 --> 01:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
january one of 09 they have met
 
01:33:20.950 --> 01:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
monthly since they're correct since
 
01:33:23.510 --> 01:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
their creation so so the committee meets
 
01:33:26.790 --> 01:33:26.800 align:start position:0%
ev every month um second
 
01:33:30.550 --> 01:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
um the committee sets
 
01:33:33.430 --> 01:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
based upon um they recommend the asset
 
01:33:34.390 --> 01:33:34.400 align:start position:0%
allocation to
 
01:33:37.510 --> 01:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
to the board and and the committee and
 
01:33:38.310 --> 01:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
the board
 
01:33:41.830 --> 01:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
are long-term investors um the the
 
01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:42.870 align:start position:0%
are long-term investors um the the
problem

01:33:42.870 --> 01:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:33:45.590 --> 01:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
that happens with an attempt at market
 
01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:46.790 align:start position:0%
that happens with an attempt at market
timing

01:33:46.790 --> 01:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
timing
 
01:33:49.189 --> 01:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
is you have to get both decisions
 
01:33:50.470 --> 01:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
exactly right
 
01:33:52.950 --> 01:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
whether you're selling and buying or
 
01:33:53.750 --> 01:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
buying and then
 
01:33:56.790 --> 01:33:56.800 align:start position:0%
selling so the committee while
 
01:33:59.830 --> 01:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
was cognizant of what was going on did
 
01:34:02.070 --> 01:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
not make any short-term changes in the
 
01:34:04.149 --> 01:34:04.159 align:start position:0%
asset allocation
 
01:34:07.830 --> 01:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
so follow mountain chair follow up
 
01:34:10.950 --> 01:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
yeah so a fancy way of telling me you
 
01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:11.510 align:start position:0%
yeah so a fancy way of telling me you
guys

01:34:11.510 --> 01:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
guys
 
01:34:13.590 --> 01:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
watched you were more they were more
 
01:34:15.030 --> 01:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
spectators than partic
 
01:34:16.709 --> 01:34:16.719 align:start position:0%
active participants and what happened in
 
01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
the first quarter of 2020
 
01:34:21.270 --> 01:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
no i i wouldn't say they were part they
 
01:34:22.550 --> 01:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
were um
 
01:34:25.189 --> 01:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
spectators they they were cognizant of
 
01:34:26.470 --> 01:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
what was happening
 
01:34:28.149 --> 01:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
they recognized that this was
 
01:34:30.390 --> 01:34:30.400 align:start position:0%
potentially a very short-term
 
01:34:34.709 --> 01:34:34.719 align:start position:0%
change um and have been rewarded
 
01:34:43.030 --> 01:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:44.950 --> 01:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:34:49.189 --> 01:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:52.390 --> 01:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh
 
01:34:54.310 --> 01:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
one question and it's good to hear that
 
01:34:55.910 --> 01:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
we're in the top
 
01:35:00.070 --> 01:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
74 of uh peers in investing
 
01:35:03.510 --> 01:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
but if i look at
 
01:35:07.750 --> 01:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:09.990 --> 01:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
this one percent was a lot worse than
 
01:35:11.270 --> 01:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
our peers did
 
01:35:13.510 --> 01:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
and what was our percentage if could you
 
01:35:15.189 --> 01:35:15.199 align:start position:0%
refresh my mind as to what that memory
 
01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
of what that percentage was where we
 
01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:17.510 align:start position:0%
of what that percentage was where we
stood

01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
stood
 
01:35:19.109 --> 01:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
with this one percent because i think
 
01:35:21.189 --> 01:35:21.199 align:start position:0%
that's part of the reason
 
01:35:24.709 --> 01:35:24.719 align:start position:0%
why we failed 1.1 for the fiscal year
 
01:35:26.310 --> 01:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
ending june 30
 
01:35:29.669 --> 01:35:29.679 align:start position:0%
um put us in the in the bottom decile of
 
01:35:29.679 --> 01:35:31.030 align:start position:0%
um put us in the in the bottom decile of
piers

01:35:31.030 --> 01:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
piers
 
01:35:34.149 --> 01:35:34.159 align:start position:0%
and that was primarily because
 
01:35:37.669 --> 01:35:37.679 align:start position:0%
for that one year period um the s p
 
01:35:40.790 --> 01:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
500 outperformed everything
 
01:35:44.070 --> 01:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
um the barclays ag outperformed
 
01:35:46.870 --> 01:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
everything on the fixed income side the
 
01:35:49.750 --> 01:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
portfolio was well diversified
 
01:35:53.109 --> 01:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
um and did not own just the s p 500
 
01:35:57.109 --> 01:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
nor did it just own the um barclays ag
 
01:35:58.790 --> 01:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
and as i mentioned the performance
 
01:36:00.390 --> 01:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
through november
 
01:36:03.590 --> 01:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
um 30th um has has rewarded that
 
01:36:06.149 --> 01:36:06.159 align:start position:0%
well-diversified portfolio
 
01:36:08.149 --> 01:36:08.159 align:start position:0%
so the the one-year return and the
 
01:36:10.070 --> 01:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
bottom decile
 
01:36:14.470 --> 01:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
is is an anomaly um primarily based upon
 
01:36:16.790 --> 01:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
the the very strong performance of the s
 
01:36:18.070 --> 01:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
p 500 and
 
01:36:22.550 --> 01:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:26.229 --> 01:36:26.239 align:start position:0%
was the follow-up thank you madam chair
 
01:36:27.990 --> 01:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
what were the returns of those that were
 
01:36:30.070 --> 01:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
in the uh upper percentage of
 
01:36:32.470 --> 01:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
this past year if we were to look at
 
01:36:35.109 --> 01:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
what comparing our 1.1 percent to what
 
01:36:36.149 --> 01:36:36.159 align:start position:0%
they were making
 
01:36:39.350 --> 01:36:39.360 align:start position:0%
where were they were in the the
 
01:36:42.149 --> 01:36:42.159 align:start position:0%
low single digits there was a very
 
01:36:44.229 --> 01:36:44.239 align:start position:0%
narrow range between
 
01:36:50.830 --> 01:36:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:54.709 --> 01:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
representative of it um thank you
 
01:36:56.629 --> 01:36:56.639 align:start position:0%
can you give me the latest number on the
 
01:36:58.550 --> 01:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
unfunded liabilities side
 
01:37:02.550 --> 01:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
please yeah our funded ratio is
 
01:37:06.149 --> 01:37:06.159 align:start position:0%
is approximately 61 percent our unfunded
 
01:37:08.709 --> 01:37:08.719 align:start position:0%
liabilities approximately six billion
 
01:37:09.750 --> 01:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
dollars there are
 
01:37:11.830 --> 01:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
slides later on that go into the detail
 
01:37:13.669 --> 01:37:13.679 align:start position:0%
of that
 
01:37:18.550 --> 01:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions
 
01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
i'd like to say that when i after
 
01:37:23.430 --> 01:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
talking with people at the session
 
01:37:26.550 --> 01:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
i checked one of my retirement accounts
 
01:37:29.030 --> 01:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
and i was down three and a half percent
 
01:37:30.550 --> 01:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
june to june
 
01:37:34.149 --> 01:37:34.159 align:start position:0%
but up over the course of 2020 so i
 
01:37:37.510 --> 01:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
it was a difficult period as you all
 
01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:39.669 align:start position:0%
it was a difficult period as you all
know

01:37:39.669 --> 01:37:39.679 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:37:41.189 --> 01:37:41.199 align:start position:0%
madam chair this is uh george
 
01:37:43.030 --> 01:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
legislative just mentioned
 
01:37:44.950 --> 01:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
um i appreciate the nature of the
 
01:37:46.310 --> 01:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
questions we're hearing
 
01:37:47.830 --> 01:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
um but i think the thing i would
 
01:37:49.830 --> 01:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
emphasize um
 
01:37:53.189 --> 01:37:53.199 align:start position:0%
is that you know this is the this is
 
01:37:55.030 --> 01:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
in largely in part what happens when you
 
01:37:57.430 --> 01:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
look at snapshots and not the movie
 
01:37:59.990 --> 01:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
um you know the the track record over
 
01:38:01.990 --> 01:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
the past 10 years has been excellent
 
01:38:04.229 --> 01:38:04.239 align:start position:0%
uh we're in the top 26 percent not the
 
01:38:06.790 --> 01:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
top 74 percent over that period
 
01:38:09.830 --> 01:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
and june 30 of uh 20
 
01:38:13.030 --> 01:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
um is one day and because of the way
 
01:38:14.870 --> 01:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
this process works
 
01:38:17.189 --> 01:38:17.199 align:start position:0%
every that that day june 30 of every
 
01:38:19.350 --> 01:38:19.360 align:start position:0%
year is when the picture is taken
 
01:38:23.510 --> 01:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
so it's uh one's one frame in a movie
 
01:38:26.149 --> 01:38:26.159 align:start position:0%
and what counts is the movie so over
 
01:38:28.310 --> 01:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
over that time period uh the results
 
01:38:28.790 --> 01:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
have been
 
01:38:31.350 --> 01:38:31.360 align:start position:0%
excellent and again if you look at where
 
01:38:32.149 --> 01:38:32.159 align:start position:0%
we are
 
01:38:33.669 --> 01:38:33.679 align:start position:0%
in the first five months of the current
 
01:38:36.390 --> 01:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal year we're double digits 14
 
01:38:37.830 --> 01:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
and if you just look at that in
 
01:38:40.149 --> 01:38:40.159 align:start position:0%
comparison in addition to where we just
 
01:38:41.750 --> 01:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
entered the last fiscal year
 
01:38:44.870 --> 01:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
you can see how things over time give
 
01:38:46.229 --> 01:38:46.239 align:start position:0%
you a much different impression than
 
01:38:48.629 --> 01:38:48.639 align:start position:0%
they do if you pick any particular day
 
01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
so not to belabor it but i think that's
 
01:38:55.510 --> 01:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:59.430 --> 01:38:59.440 align:start position:0%
isn't it like us uh thank you madam
 
01:38:59.440 --> 01:38:59.830 align:start position:0%
isn't it like us uh thank you madam
chair

01:38:59.830 --> 01:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:39:01.430 --> 01:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh please remind me what is the number
 
01:39:03.990 --> 01:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
of years that uh
 
01:39:05.990 --> 01:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know the the data is averaged
 
01:39:08.790 --> 01:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
over to determine the rates that the uh
 
01:39:11.109 --> 01:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
participating employers pay i mean what
 
01:39:12.229 --> 01:39:12.239 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering is
 
01:39:15.669 --> 01:39:15.679 align:start position:0%
um to what extent is this you know one
 
01:39:17.109 --> 01:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
year's result
 
01:39:19.669 --> 01:39:19.679 align:start position:0%
gonna have uh increased costs for uh you
 
01:39:21.270 --> 01:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
know the municipalities and
 
01:39:25.030 --> 01:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh other employers as i mentioned
 
01:39:27.910 --> 01:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
on one of the earlier slides that one
 
01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:29.430 align:start position:0%
on one of the earlier slides that one
year

01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:39:32.709 --> 01:39:32.719 align:start position:0%
at 20 will be smoothed over
 
01:39:34.870 --> 01:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
five years the next rate setting
 
01:39:37.430 --> 01:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
valuation will be june 30
 
01:39:42.149 --> 01:39:42.159 align:start position:0%
21 um and and um obviously i don't know
 
01:39:43.830 --> 01:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
what our performance will be for the
 
01:39:45.910 --> 01:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal year ending 21
 
01:39:48.390 --> 01:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
but that will be in addition to the
 
01:39:49.990 --> 01:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
prior four years
 
01:39:52.149 --> 01:39:52.159 align:start position:0%
and smoothed over that period par part
 
01:39:52.159 --> 01:39:53.189 align:start position:0%
and smoothed over that period par part
of

01:39:53.189 --> 01:39:53.199 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:39:55.990 --> 01:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
the the reduction in the assumed rate of
 
01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:57.030 align:start position:0%
the the reduction in the assumed rate of
return

01:39:57.030 --> 01:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
return
 
01:40:00.870 --> 01:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
that the board adopted um last spring
 
01:40:03.910 --> 01:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
was due to the lower expectations across
 
01:40:07.189 --> 01:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
all the capital markets um as
 
01:40:11.669 --> 01:40:11.679 align:start position:0%
we move forward uh follow-up please
 
01:40:14.950 --> 01:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
follow up um so was there an
 
01:40:18.310 --> 01:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
increase um said at the end of june
 
01:40:20.229 --> 01:40:20.239 align:start position:0%
and what the municipalities had to pay i
 
01:40:22.229 --> 01:40:22.239 align:start position:0%
understand it would have been
 
01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
less than the full amount because it's
 
01:40:25.030 --> 01:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
averaged over five years but was there
 
01:40:26.070 --> 01:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
an increase
 
01:40:28.550 --> 01:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
the the employer rates that were
 
01:40:30.950 --> 01:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
certified by the board
 
01:40:34.229 --> 01:40:34.239 align:start position:0%
in september of 20
 
01:40:37.990 --> 01:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
was based upon the actual valuation
 
01:40:41.109 --> 01:40:41.119 align:start position:0%
at june 30 19. so the
 
01:40:44.790 --> 01:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
the results of june 3020 and the results
 
01:40:46.070 --> 01:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
of june 30
 
01:40:49.510 --> 01:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
to be 21 will be incorporated in the
 
01:40:52.550 --> 01:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
valuation as of 21 to set the rates
 
01:40:55.750 --> 01:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
in 22. so so the rates set in
 
01:40:58.709 --> 01:40:58.719 align:start position:0%
uh september of 20 were based upon the
 
01:41:01.750 --> 01:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year ending june 30 19.
 
01:41:07.510 --> 01:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:09.669 --> 01:41:09.679 align:start position:0%
thank you manager just one quick
 
01:41:10.790 --> 01:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
question i guess
 
01:41:14.149 --> 01:41:14.159 align:start position:0%
probably for larry if i know
 
01:41:17.270 --> 01:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
our fiscal year goes
 
01:41:20.229 --> 01:41:20.239 align:start position:0%
july 1 to june 30 um and we're getting
 
01:41:23.189 --> 01:41:23.199 align:start position:0%
our returns based on that time frame
 
01:41:27.189 --> 01:41:27.199 align:start position:0%
can is there a significant difference
 
01:41:27.199 --> 01:41:28.149 align:start position:0%
can is there a significant difference
using

01:41:28.149 --> 01:41:28.159 align:start position:0%
using
 
01:41:31.350 --> 01:41:31.360 align:start position:0%
that time frame versus using a january
 
01:41:33.590 --> 01:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
1 to december 30th time frame in the
 
01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:35.750 align:start position:0%
1 to december 30th time frame in the
market

01:41:35.750 --> 01:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
market
 
01:41:38.470 --> 01:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
over one period over one year period yes
 
01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:38.950 align:start position:0%
over one period over one year period yes
the

01:41:38.950 --> 01:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:41:40.629 --> 01:41:40.639 align:start position:0%
calendar year returns versus the fiscal
 
01:41:42.550 --> 01:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
year returns can be
 
01:41:45.910 --> 01:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
dramatically different um
 
01:41:49.750 --> 01:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
we don't have the 12 31 performance
 
01:41:52.950 --> 01:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
um as of yet we expect that
 
01:41:56.790 --> 01:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
sometime next week but um clearly
 
01:41:59.910 --> 01:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
the the second half of 20 is
 
01:42:01.990 --> 01:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
dramatically better than the first half
 
01:42:04.229 --> 01:42:04.239 align:start position:0%
of 20 and i expect that to be
 
01:42:06.790 --> 01:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
um substantially better than the fiscal
 
01:42:07.990 --> 01:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
year returns
 
01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
but but again these are one-year returns
 
01:42:15.669 --> 01:42:15.679 align:start position:0%
to reiterate what what george said is
 
01:42:19.109 --> 01:42:19.119 align:start position:0%
we are a long-term investor and
 
01:42:21.109 --> 01:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
one-year returns are important but the
 
01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
longer-term returns are
 
01:42:25.990 --> 01:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
much more important follow-up madam
 
01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:26.870 align:start position:0%
much more important follow-up madam
chair

01:42:26.870 --> 01:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:42:30.070 --> 01:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up uh yeah i'm not talking just
 
01:42:31.669 --> 01:42:31.679 align:start position:0%
about this year i'm talking about
 
01:42:31.679 --> 01:42:32.790 align:start position:0%
about this year i'm talking about
historically

01:42:32.790 --> 01:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
historically
 
01:42:35.109 --> 01:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
year-over-year using that time frame of
 
01:42:37.750 --> 01:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
january to december versus
 
01:42:41.350 --> 01:42:41.360 align:start position:0%
july to june and i mean you know
 
01:42:43.430 --> 01:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
they will be different but over the long
 
01:42:45.990 --> 01:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
term the averages will still be
 
01:42:50.709 --> 01:42:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:55.189 --> 01:42:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:59.270 --> 01:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:01.910 --> 01:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
okay i think that's me uh good morning
 
01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:03.030 align:start position:0%
okay i think that's me uh good morning
everyone

01:43:03.030 --> 01:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
01:43:04.790 --> 01:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
i'm gerard murphy i'm the director of
 
01:43:07.350 --> 01:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
finance here at nhrs
 
01:43:10.790 --> 01:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
and i will be uh discussing uh the next
 
01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:11.510 align:start position:0%
and i will be uh discussing uh the next
slides

01:43:11.510 --> 01:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
slides
 
01:43:13.430 --> 01:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
the next four slides beginning on number
 
01:43:15.669 --> 01:43:15.679 align:start position:0%
20 here
 
01:43:18.470 --> 01:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
so here we go if you recall the trust
 
01:43:19.750 --> 01:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
fund equation
 
01:43:21.910 --> 01:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
from a few slides earlier there are two
 
01:43:24.310 --> 01:43:24.320 align:start position:0%
inputs on the left side of that equation
 
01:43:25.910 --> 01:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
now that larry has covered the
 
01:43:28.070 --> 01:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
investment income i'll talk a little bit
 
01:43:31.189 --> 01:43:31.199 align:start position:0%
about the the other input contributions
 
01:43:33.270 --> 01:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
contribution amounts are calculated as
 
01:43:35.669 --> 01:43:35.679 align:start position:0%
percentage rates of payroll for members
 
01:43:37.590 --> 01:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
covered by nhrs
 
01:43:40.870 --> 01:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
what we refer to as covered payroll
 
01:43:42.709 --> 01:43:42.719 align:start position:0%
and there are two types as you've heard
 
01:43:44.070 --> 01:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
earlier there are two types of
 
01:43:46.550 --> 01:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
of contributions coming into nhrs the
 
01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:47.590 align:start position:0%
of contributions coming into nhrs the
first

01:43:47.590 --> 01:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:43:49.910 --> 01:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
are member contributions and they are
 
01:43:51.510 --> 01:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
set in state statute
 
01:43:52.950 --> 01:43:52.960 align:start position:0%
with the rates for the four different
 
01:43:55.430 --> 01:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
plans listed here on this slide
 
01:43:57.350 --> 01:43:57.360 align:start position:0%
these rates tend not to change very
 
01:43:59.350 --> 01:43:59.360 align:start position:0%
often as it has been
 
01:44:01.270 --> 01:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
over 10 years since those rent since
 
01:44:02.790 --> 01:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
those rates have have last
 
01:44:05.990 --> 01:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
changed the other contribution
 
01:44:09.030 --> 01:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
type is employer contributions these
 
01:44:11.109 --> 01:44:11.119 align:start position:0%
contribution rates are calculated every
 
01:44:11.830 --> 01:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
two years
 
01:44:14.229 --> 01:44:14.239 align:start position:0%
in our odd year actuarial valuation
 
01:44:14.239 --> 01:44:15.109 align:start position:0%
in our odd year actuarial valuation
reports

01:44:15.109 --> 01:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
reports
 
01:44:17.430 --> 01:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
and then certified by the nhrs board of
 
01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:19.270 align:start position:0%
and then certified by the nhrs board of
trustees

01:44:19.270 --> 01:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
trustees
 
01:44:20.950 --> 01:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
there are different rates for each of
 
01:44:22.310 --> 01:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
the four member groups
 
01:44:24.790 --> 01:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
and each rate is made up of uh the three
 
01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:25.910 align:start position:0%
and each rate is made up of uh the three
components

01:44:25.910 --> 01:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
components
 
01:44:28.310 --> 01:44:28.320 align:start position:0%
the normal cost the unfunded actuarial
 
01:44:29.590 --> 01:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
accrued liability
 
01:44:32.310 --> 01:44:32.320 align:start position:0%
and the medical subsidy uh we'll talk a
 
01:44:34.310 --> 01:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
little more about these components
 
01:44:36.629 --> 01:44:36.639 align:start position:0%
in a bit but the last thing i wanted to
 
01:44:36.639 --> 01:44:37.350 align:start position:0%
in a bit but the last thing i wanted to
mention

01:44:37.350 --> 01:44:37.360 align:start position:0%
mention
 
01:44:40.229 --> 01:44:40.239 align:start position:0%
from this slide was that last bullet
 
01:44:40.239 --> 01:44:41.910 align:start position:0%
from this slide was that last bullet
regarding

01:44:41.910 --> 01:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
01:44:44.149 --> 01:44:44.159 align:start position:0%
the fact that political subdivisions
 
01:44:45.030 --> 01:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
have been pla
 
01:44:47.350 --> 01:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
paying the full employer contribution
 
01:44:48.149 --> 01:44:48.159 align:start position:0%
cost for
 
01:44:50.709 --> 01:44:50.719 align:start position:0%
all of their nhrs members since the
 
01:44:53.109 --> 01:44:53.119 align:start position:0%
state subsidy was repealed in
 
01:44:56.070 --> 01:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
2011. for a number of years before that
 
01:44:57.990 --> 01:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
the state had been paying a portion of
 
01:45:00.310 --> 01:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
the employer contributions for teachers
 
01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
police and fire members for all local
 
01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:05.510 align:start position:0%
police and fire members for all local
employers

01:45:05.510 --> 01:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
employers
 
01:45:10.229 --> 01:45:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:13.669 --> 01:45:13.679 align:start position:0%
all right so the three components
 
01:45:17.669 --> 01:45:17.679 align:start position:0%
of the rates normal cost
 
01:45:19.669 --> 01:45:19.679 align:start position:0%
normal cost is just the basics the
 
01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
estimated cost of pension benefits as
 
01:45:22.870 --> 01:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
they are earned
 
01:45:25.990 --> 01:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
in the absence of of any other factors
 
01:45:27.830 --> 01:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
the member contributions that we talked
 
01:45:29.750 --> 01:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
about on the last page cover most of the
 
01:45:32.070 --> 01:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
normal cost with the employer rate
 
01:45:33.669 --> 01:45:33.679 align:start position:0%
with the component of the employer rate
 
01:45:35.910 --> 01:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
making up the difference
 
01:45:37.910 --> 01:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
the the next component of the employer
 
01:45:40.070 --> 01:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
rate is the portion that goes to pay off
 
01:45:43.510 --> 01:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
the unfunded liability the ual
 
01:45:45.750 --> 01:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
this is the estimated value of benefits
 
01:45:47.669 --> 01:45:47.679 align:start position:0%
accrued in the past but not yet
 
01:45:50.870 --> 01:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
funded it is determined by the actuaries
 
01:45:52.870 --> 01:45:52.880 align:start position:0%
and calculated by comparing the
 
01:45:54.950 --> 01:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
actuarial present value of projected
 
01:45:54.960 --> 01:45:55.750 align:start position:0%
actuarial present value of projected
benefits

01:45:55.750 --> 01:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
01:45:58.709 --> 01:45:58.719 align:start position:0%
with the actuarial value of trust assets
 
01:45:59.830 --> 01:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
and the difference
 
01:46:03.350 --> 01:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
is the ual the ual gets a lot of
 
01:46:04.310 --> 01:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
attention and it
 
01:46:06.229 --> 01:46:06.239 align:start position:0%
makes up a substantial portion of the
 
01:46:08.950 --> 01:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
contribution rates for nhrs employers
 
01:46:12.229 --> 01:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
as you will see in a later slide
 
01:46:15.430 --> 01:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
as of 6 30 20 the the nhrs ual balance
 
01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
was 6.04 billion
 
01:46:20.149 --> 01:46:20.159 align:start position:0%
and this resulted in a funded ratio of
 
01:46:24.310 --> 01:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:26.550 --> 01:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
there are a number of factors driving
 
01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
this current ual balance
 
01:46:31.910 --> 01:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
first up were the artificially low
 
01:46:33.590 --> 01:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
employer contributions
 
01:46:35.910 --> 01:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
caused by a flawed statutory funding
 
01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:37.030 align:start position:0%
caused by a flawed statutory funding
methodology

01:46:37.030 --> 01:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
methodology
 
01:46:39.590 --> 01:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
put in place in response to economic
 
01:46:41.750 --> 01:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
pressure back in the 90s
 
01:46:44.229 --> 01:46:44.239 align:start position:0%
the this this flawed funding methodology
 
01:46:46.470 --> 01:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
was coupled with an extended period of
 
01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:47.189 align:start position:0%
was coupled with an extended period of
transferring

01:46:47.189 --> 01:46:47.199 align:start position:0%
transferring
 
01:46:49.990 --> 01:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh so-called excess earnings returns
 
01:46:52.070 --> 01:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
above a certain threshold
 
01:46:54.070 --> 01:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
out of the pension trust and into the
 
01:46:56.390 --> 01:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
special account
 
01:46:59.189 --> 01:46:59.199 align:start position:0%
um these the these conditions were then
 
01:46:59.199 --> 01:47:00.149 align:start position:0%
um these the these conditions were then
exasp

01:47:00.149 --> 01:47:00.159 align:start position:0%
exasp
 
01:47:02.229 --> 01:47:02.239 align:start position:0%
were then exacerbated by the financial
 
01:47:04.870 --> 01:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
crisis in 08 and 09
 
01:47:08.229 --> 01:47:08.239 align:start position:0%
and then the third main driver of the uh
 
01:47:10.310 --> 01:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
the growth in the ual has been the
 
01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:11.510 align:start position:0%
the growth in the ual has been the
reductions

01:47:11.510 --> 01:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
reductions
 
01:47:12.950 --> 01:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
have been the reductions in the assumed
 
01:47:14.790 --> 01:47:14.800 align:start position:0%
rate of return in 2011
 
01:47:18.229 --> 01:47:18.239 align:start position:0%
2016 and most recently in 2020.
 
01:47:19.990 --> 01:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
all of these reductions were enacted in
 
01:47:21.750 --> 01:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
response to recommendations from our
 
01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:22.709 align:start position:0%
response to recommendations from our
actuaries

01:47:22.709 --> 01:47:22.719 align:start position:0%
actuaries
 
01:47:25.189 --> 01:47:25.199 align:start position:0%
after conducting actuarial experience
 
01:47:25.199 --> 01:47:27.109 align:start position:0%
after conducting actuarial experience
studies

01:47:27.109 --> 01:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
studies
 
01:47:30.550 --> 01:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
uh the last thing about the u the ual
 
01:47:31.990 --> 01:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
that i wanted to mention was the
 
01:47:34.149 --> 01:47:34.159 align:start position:0%
amortization schedule
 
01:47:35.910 --> 01:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
a little over 10 years ago the
 
01:47:38.709 --> 01:47:38.719 align:start position:0%
legislature enacted a closed 30-year
 
01:47:41.590 --> 01:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
period to pay off the uaal
 
01:47:44.629 --> 01:47:44.639 align:start position:0%
uh that period ended in 20 or will end
 
01:47:46.390 --> 01:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
in 2039
 
01:47:48.629 --> 01:47:48.639 align:start position:0%
uh then a few years ago layered
 
01:47:51.669 --> 01:47:51.679 align:start position:0%
amortization was introduced
 
01:47:54.229 --> 01:47:54.239 align:start position:0%
the closed period that original closed
 
01:47:55.030 --> 01:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
period with
 
01:47:57.590 --> 01:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
20 years remaining was kept in place for
 
01:47:59.590 --> 01:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
the ual balance
 
01:48:03.510 --> 01:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
as of 6 30 2017 and then
 
01:48:06.390 --> 01:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
the change in the ual for every two year
 
01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:06.870 align:start position:0%
the change in the ual for every two year
period

01:48:06.870 --> 01:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
period
 
01:48:10.149 --> 01:48:10.159 align:start position:0%
after that will then be amortized over a
 
01:48:10.159 --> 01:48:11.189 align:start position:0%
after that will then be amortized over a
period

01:48:11.189 --> 01:48:11.199 align:start position:0%
period
 
01:48:13.510 --> 01:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
not to exceed 20 years so there will be
 
01:48:15.669 --> 01:48:15.679 align:start position:0%
a layer every two years
 
01:48:19.109 --> 01:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
to amortize changes to the ual
 
01:48:20.950 --> 01:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
and this this layered amortization was
 
01:48:22.470 --> 01:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
put into place to
 
01:48:25.109 --> 01:48:25.119 align:start position:0%
eliminate uh some of the volatility that
 
01:48:26.229 --> 01:48:26.239 align:start position:0%
would have been present
 
01:48:29.510 --> 01:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
under the old set closed structure of
 
01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:29.910 align:start position:0%
under the old set closed structure of
that

01:48:29.910 --> 01:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:48:33.430 --> 01:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
that 30 years
 
01:48:36.070 --> 01:48:36.080 align:start position:0%
so let's see where am i okay uh the last
 
01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:36.790 align:start position:0%
so let's see where am i okay uh the last
component

01:48:36.790 --> 01:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
component
 
01:48:40.390 --> 01:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
of the employer rate so we had we had
 
01:48:41.030 --> 01:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:48:43.910 --> 01:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
the normal cost the unfunded liability
 
01:48:45.430 --> 01:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
and then the last component it's the
 
01:48:46.629 --> 01:48:46.639 align:start position:0%
medical subsidy
 
01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
and as you heard uh before uh
 
01:48:51.270 --> 01:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
eligibility for this subsidy program is
 
01:48:52.149 --> 01:48:52.159 align:start position:0%
now closed
 
01:48:55.189 --> 01:48:55.199 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a dwindling population and
 
01:48:57.430 --> 01:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
funding is determined on a pay-as-you-go
 
01:48:57.440 --> 01:48:58.550 align:start position:0%
funding is determined on a pay-as-you-go
basis

01:48:58.550 --> 01:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
basis
 
01:49:00.870 --> 01:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
so it's really enough to keep the
 
01:49:01.910 --> 01:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
program running with
 
01:49:04.229 --> 01:49:04.239 align:start position:0%
uh with margins put in place in case
 
01:49:07.109 --> 01:49:07.119 align:start position:0%
experience comes in higher
 
01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
okay if we could move to the next slide
 
01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:12.830 align:start position:0%
okay if we could move to the next slide
please

01:49:12.830 --> 01:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:17.270 --> 01:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:49:20.709 --> 01:49:20.719 align:start position:0%
here we have our two main work products
 
01:49:24.310 --> 01:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
of our actuarial consultant um
 
01:49:26.629 --> 01:49:26.639 align:start position:0%
we actually we get a valuation report
 
01:49:29.589 --> 01:49:29.599 align:start position:0%
every year however the even year reports
 
01:49:31.430 --> 01:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
are scaled down versions
 
01:49:33.030 --> 01:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
and they really only provide us with the
 
01:49:34.870 --> 01:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
information we need uh
 
01:49:36.870 --> 01:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
to complete our annual financial
 
01:49:38.629 --> 01:49:38.639 align:start position:0%
statements and be in compliance with
 
01:49:41.350 --> 01:49:41.360 align:start position:0%
with gasby requirements
 
01:49:44.550 --> 01:49:44.560 align:start position:0%
but the um but the
 
01:49:46.950 --> 01:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh the odd year valuation reports can
 
01:49:48.229 --> 01:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
they're they're beefed up
 
01:49:50.790 --> 01:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
versions of the reports and they contain
 
01:49:51.910 --> 01:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
all of the information
 
01:49:55.109 --> 01:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
necessary for the board to set rates
 
01:49:56.870 --> 01:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
um as we discussed before the reports
 
01:49:58.950 --> 01:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
have calculations for present value of
 
01:50:00.790 --> 01:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
projected benefits for the actuarial
 
01:50:02.550 --> 01:50:02.560 align:start position:0%
value of assets
 
01:50:05.669 --> 01:50:05.679 align:start position:0%
uh deriving the the ual and and the
 
01:50:09.030 --> 01:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:11.030 --> 01:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
the the second report listed on this
 
01:50:13.430 --> 01:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
slide is the actuarial experience study
 
01:50:17.189 --> 01:50:17.199 align:start position:0%
which is conducted every four years
 
01:50:19.990 --> 01:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
these reports compare actual experience
 
01:50:21.030 --> 01:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
with the actuarial
 
01:50:23.030 --> 01:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
assumptions in place in order to
 
01:50:24.470 --> 01:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
determine if changes to those
 
01:50:26.629 --> 01:50:26.639 align:start position:0%
assumptions should be made
 
01:50:28.149 --> 01:50:28.159 align:start position:0%
there are two types of actuarial
 
01:50:31.430 --> 01:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
assumptions demographic and economic
 
01:50:33.189 --> 01:50:33.199 align:start position:0%
the demographic assumptions include
 
01:50:35.270 --> 01:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
things like mortality rates retirement
 
01:50:35.280 --> 01:50:36.470 align:start position:0%
things like mortality rates retirement
rates

01:50:36.470 --> 01:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
rates
 
01:50:39.030 --> 01:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
system withdrawal rates disability rates
 
01:50:40.470 --> 01:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing
 
01:50:43.270 --> 01:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
where the economic assumptions include
 
01:50:44.550 --> 01:50:44.560 align:start position:0%
the assumed rate of return
 
01:50:47.990 --> 01:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
the wage inflation rate um and the price
 
01:50:50.310 --> 01:50:50.320 align:start position:0%
inflation rate
 
01:50:52.950 --> 01:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
the most recent experience study covered
 
01:50:54.629 --> 01:50:54.639 align:start position:0%
the four-year period
 
01:50:58.149 --> 01:50:58.159 align:start position:0%
fiscal years 2016 to 2019
 
01:51:00.390 --> 01:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
and it was presented to the board in the
 
01:51:03.030 --> 01:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
spring of 2020.
 
01:51:04.870 --> 01:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
the assumption changes recommended in
 
01:51:06.390 --> 01:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
that report were then used
 
01:51:09.270 --> 01:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
in the 630-19 actuarial evaluation
 
01:51:10.629 --> 01:51:10.639 align:start position:0%
report presented to the
 
01:51:13.589 --> 01:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
board in the summer of 2020 and this
 
01:51:15.430 --> 01:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
report was then used to certify rates
 
01:51:17.189 --> 01:51:17.199 align:start position:0%
for the 2223 biennium
 
01:51:20.229 --> 01:51:20.239 align:start position:0%
in september of 2020.
 
01:51:24.470 --> 01:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:28.070 --> 01:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
so what what did the board do
 
01:51:30.070 --> 01:51:30.080 align:start position:0%
based on the recommendations contained
 
01:51:33.189 --> 01:51:33.199 align:start position:0%
in the the 16 to 19 experience study
 
01:51:35.830 --> 01:51:35.840 align:start position:0%
and input from nhrs staff our
 
01:51:37.589 --> 01:51:37.599 align:start position:0%
independent investment consultant
 
01:51:40.229 --> 01:51:40.239 align:start position:0%
and a number of economic experts the
 
01:51:42.229 --> 01:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
board voted to change assumptions both
 
01:51:42.239 --> 01:51:43.189 align:start position:0%
board voted to change assumptions both
demographic

01:51:43.189 --> 01:51:43.199 align:start position:0%
demographic
 
01:51:45.990 --> 01:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
and economic on the demographic side the
 
01:51:48.310 --> 01:51:48.320 align:start position:0%
biggest impact was the change
 
01:51:51.030 --> 01:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
to mortality rates and this was was
 
01:51:53.189 --> 01:51:53.199 align:start position:0%
driven mainly by the adoption of
 
01:51:56.870 --> 01:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
new public pension plan mortality tables
 
01:51:59.990 --> 01:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh they're a relatively new creation
 
01:52:03.830 --> 01:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
specific to public pension plans
 
01:52:06.070 --> 01:52:06.080 align:start position:0%
on the economic side you can see those
 
01:52:08.149 --> 01:52:08.159 align:start position:0%
changes listed on the slide here
 
01:52:09.750 --> 01:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
wage growth and inflation rates were
 
01:52:11.830 --> 01:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
decreased i want to point out
 
01:52:14.550 --> 01:52:14.560 align:start position:0%
as you heard before there's a lower wage
 
01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:15.270 align:start position:0%
as you heard before there's a lower wage
growth

01:52:15.270 --> 01:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
growth
 
01:52:17.350 --> 01:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
for teachers and that's due to the
 
01:52:19.350 --> 01:52:19.360 align:start position:0%
long-term decline in the population of
 
01:52:20.470 --> 01:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
teachers so they're
 
01:52:22.070 --> 01:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
they're at a slightly lower rate than
 
01:52:25.270 --> 01:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
the other three uh employee groups
 
01:52:27.750 --> 01:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
and then obviously as you've you've all
 
01:52:30.229 --> 01:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
heard the change with the biggest impact
 
01:52:32.950 --> 01:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
was the reduction to the uh the a the
 
01:52:35.189 --> 01:52:35.199 align:start position:0%
assumed rate of return
 
01:52:37.750 --> 01:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
so with that that ends my my portion of
 
01:52:38.709 --> 01:52:38.719 align:start position:0%
the presentation
 
01:52:40.709 --> 01:52:40.719 align:start position:0%
uh before i turn it before i turn it
 
01:52:42.310 --> 01:52:42.320 align:start position:0%
back over to george i'd be happy to try
 
01:52:47.109 --> 01:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:51.669 --> 01:52:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:54.870 --> 01:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh
 
01:52:57.910 --> 01:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
just one quick question i have because
 
01:52:57.920 --> 01:52:59.030 align:start position:0%
just one quick question i have because
it

01:52:59.030 --> 01:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:53:01.189 --> 01:53:01.199 align:start position:0%
dramatically increased the unfunded
 
01:53:03.430 --> 01:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
accrued liability
 
01:53:06.709 --> 01:53:06.719 align:start position:0%
was reducing the assumed rate of return
 
01:53:08.310 --> 01:53:08.320 align:start position:0%
you had the option looking at the
 
01:53:10.229 --> 01:53:10.239 align:start position:0%
minutes of going to 7
 
01:53:13.669 --> 01:53:13.679 align:start position:0%
versus a 6.75 and knowing what that was
 
01:53:14.709 --> 01:53:14.719 align:start position:0%
going to do to the
 
01:53:17.750 --> 01:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
unfunded accrued liability and also
 
01:53:20.070 --> 01:53:20.080 align:start position:0%
to the municipalities in the rate
 
01:53:21.430 --> 01:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
setting why did
 
01:53:24.070 --> 01:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
you choose why did you choose 6.75 when
 
01:53:25.430 --> 01:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
the 7
 
01:53:33.350 --> 01:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:36.390 --> 01:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
let's see um george did you what
 
01:53:37.910 --> 01:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
were you going to cover that topic in
 
01:53:39.669 --> 01:53:39.679 align:start position:0%
your portion next yeah
 
01:53:41.830 --> 01:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
yeah certainly and i'm happy to just
 
01:53:43.510 --> 01:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
address it now because we'll come to it
 
01:53:44.629 --> 01:53:44.639 align:start position:0%
anyway in a minute
 
01:53:48.629 --> 01:53:48.639 align:start position:0%
um so um first of all our actuary
 
01:53:51.430 --> 01:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh told us that 7.25 wouldn't be
 
01:53:53.510 --> 01:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
considered as actuarially reasonable so
 
01:53:54.950 --> 01:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
that was the starting point so knowing
 
01:53:58.070 --> 01:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
that we knew we had to make a change
 
01:54:01.950 --> 01:54:01.960 align:start position:0%
the actuary said that a range from about
 
01:54:04.470 --> 01:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
6.25 to
 
01:54:06.629 --> 01:54:06.639 align:start position:0%
7 would be considered in the reasonable
 
01:54:09.350 --> 01:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
range but also recommended
 
01:54:11.910 --> 01:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh made it clear that his recommendation
 
01:54:14.550 --> 01:54:14.560 align:start position:0%
would have been 6.75 and that he would
 
01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:15.589 align:start position:0%
would have been 6.75 and that he would
have

01:54:15.589 --> 01:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:54:17.189 --> 01:54:17.199 align:start position:0%
frankly would have preferred a number
 
01:54:19.109 --> 01:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
low than that lower than that but he was
 
01:54:20.589 --> 01:54:20.599 align:start position:0%
willing to take
 
01:54:22.870 --> 01:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
6.75 as being reasonable and that would
 
01:54:24.550 --> 01:54:24.560 align:start position:0%
be his recommendation so he did
 
01:54:26.070 --> 01:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
acknowledge he would accept seven
 
01:54:27.910 --> 01:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
but what we thought that would do would
 
01:54:29.910 --> 01:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
i shouldn't say we because uh first of
 
01:54:31.510 --> 01:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
all staff doesn't vote on this this is a
 
01:54:32.709 --> 01:54:32.719 align:start position:0%
board decision
 
01:54:34.629 --> 01:54:34.639 align:start position:0%
but our recommendation from the staff
 
01:54:38.070 --> 01:54:38.080 align:start position:0%
standpoint was 6.75 as well
 
01:54:39.910 --> 01:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
so that being said i would mention also
 
01:54:41.430 --> 01:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
the investment committee actually came
 
01:54:43.030 --> 01:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
up with 6.5
 
01:54:45.830 --> 01:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
as the number so the the there are a
 
01:54:46.870 --> 01:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
number of different
 
01:54:49.270 --> 01:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
ways you can look at it and our point of
 
01:54:50.629 --> 01:54:50.639 align:start position:0%
view was that
 
01:54:52.149 --> 01:54:52.159 align:start position:0%
uh the message we were clearly getting
 
01:54:53.669 --> 01:54:53.679 align:start position:0%
from the actuary was
 
01:54:55.790 --> 01:54:55.800 align:start position:0%
that if we picked a number higher than
 
01:54:55.800 --> 01:54:57.270 align:start position:0%
that if we picked a number higher than
6.75

01:54:57.270 --> 01:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
6.75
 
01:54:59.350 --> 01:54:59.360 align:start position:0%
um we would likely be revisiting it in
 
01:55:00.550 --> 01:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
two-year time period
 
01:55:02.870 --> 01:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
and we don't like to be jumping around
 
01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:03.669 align:start position:0%
and we don't like to be jumping around
um

01:55:03.669 --> 01:55:03.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:05.669 --> 01:55:05.679 align:start position:0%
you know reviewing um the assumed rate
 
01:55:07.030 --> 01:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
of return on
 
01:55:09.510 --> 01:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
a two-year time period we prefer to do
 
01:55:11.589 --> 01:55:11.599 align:start position:0%
it um every four or five years
 
01:55:14.709 --> 01:55:14.719 align:start position:0%
in line with the experienced study so
 
01:55:16.310 --> 01:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
you know the objective of the board is
 
01:55:17.990 --> 01:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
to properly price the plan to
 
01:55:19.669 --> 01:55:19.679 align:start position:0%
adopt those assumptions that we think
 
01:55:21.430 --> 01:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
most closely reflect
 
01:55:23.189 --> 01:55:23.199 align:start position:0%
what the actual experience has been and
 
01:55:24.629 --> 01:55:24.639 align:start position:0%
what it's likely to be in the future
 
01:55:25.510 --> 01:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
with the advice
 
01:55:27.990 --> 01:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
from a number of sources so that's
 
01:55:32.149 --> 01:55:32.159 align:start position:0%
that's how the vote came out
 
01:55:35.750 --> 01:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:40.070 --> 01:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
and george i mean we all know that
 
01:55:42.709 --> 01:55:42.719 align:start position:0%
it also has the impact on the rates that
 
01:55:44.709 --> 01:55:44.719 align:start position:0%
municipalities pay
 
01:55:47.350 --> 01:55:47.360 align:start position:0%
um and i understand you don't want to
 
01:55:49.750 --> 01:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
revisit it every two years
 
01:55:51.830 --> 01:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
but the hit cities and towns were taking
 
01:55:53.030 --> 01:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
with that change
 
01:55:54.550 --> 01:55:54.560 align:start position:0%
i mean wouldn't it have been reasonable
 
01:55:57.350 --> 01:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
to revisit it in two years and set it at
 
01:55:59.669 --> 01:55:59.679 align:start position:0%
seven percent
 
01:56:03.270 --> 01:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
well i i think you know it was within
 
01:56:04.629 --> 01:56:04.639 align:start position:0%
the board's discretion to make that
 
01:56:04.639 --> 01:56:05.270 align:start position:0%
the board's discretion to make that
decision

01:56:05.270 --> 01:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
decision
 
01:56:07.270 --> 01:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
but i think the reason personally i
 
01:56:09.189 --> 01:56:09.199 align:start position:0%
think the decision was a good one
 
01:56:11.589 --> 01:56:11.599 align:start position:0%
was that their job is to properly set
 
01:56:13.589 --> 01:56:13.599 align:start position:0%
the assumptions based on
 
01:56:15.589 --> 01:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
the information provided and to the
 
01:56:17.350 --> 01:56:17.360 align:start position:0%
extent that
 
01:56:19.830 --> 01:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
you don't make those adjustments every
 
01:56:20.390 --> 01:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
time you
 
01:56:22.790 --> 01:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
make an adjustment in a way that causes
 
01:56:24.950 --> 01:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
you to come back and adjust it again
 
01:56:27.030 --> 01:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
just continues to add to the unfunded
 
01:56:28.390 --> 01:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
liability because what that
 
01:56:30.470 --> 01:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
what that does is you you end up under
 
01:56:30.480 --> 01:56:31.589 align:start position:0%
what that does is you you end up under
funding

01:56:31.589 --> 01:56:31.599 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:56:33.669 --> 01:56:33.679 align:start position:0%
if you're not funding in accordance with
 
01:56:35.350 --> 01:56:35.360 align:start position:0%
what reality ends up being
 
01:56:37.270 --> 01:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
so it creates a greater probability that
 
01:56:39.430 --> 01:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
you're adding to the unfunded liability
 
01:56:41.189 --> 01:56:41.199 align:start position:0%
more than you would be by adjusting it
 
01:56:43.109 --> 01:56:43.119 align:start position:0%
now you're actually strengthening the
 
01:56:44.709 --> 01:56:44.719 align:start position:0%
plan by bringing in more dollars
 
01:56:49.030 --> 01:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
is the impact substantial yes it is but
 
01:56:52.070 --> 01:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
it's also realistic in terms of what the
 
01:56:54.070 --> 01:56:54.080 align:start position:0%
plan experience has been and what
 
01:56:55.750 --> 01:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
all of our economic experts are telling
 
01:56:58.470 --> 01:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
us we should be expecting
 
01:57:00.310 --> 01:57:00.320 align:start position:0%
and and i can tell you a representative
 
01:57:02.229 --> 01:57:02.239 align:start position:0%
goalie that that issue itself wasn't
 
01:57:03.990 --> 01:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
lost at all on the board that was part
 
01:57:05.189 --> 01:57:05.199 align:start position:0%
of the discussion
 
01:57:07.030 --> 01:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
it was fully contemplated and that was
 
01:57:08.390 --> 01:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
the decision of the board
 
01:57:11.830 --> 01:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
taking all factors into consideration
 
01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:20.390 --> 01:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair my question is
 
01:57:23.189 --> 01:57:23.199 align:start position:0%
referring to uh slide number 20
 
01:57:26.310 --> 01:57:26.320 align:start position:0%
when you look at the group 1 employees
 
01:57:30.070 --> 01:57:30.080 align:start position:0%
both groups are at their contribution
 
01:57:30.080 --> 01:57:31.109 align:start position:0%
both groups are at their contribution
rates

01:57:31.109 --> 01:57:31.119 align:start position:0%
rates
 
01:57:33.510 --> 01:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
and the same percentile but there seems
 
01:57:34.149 --> 01:57:34.159 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:57:37.510 --> 01:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
a disparity on the group 2 employees
 
01:57:39.669 --> 01:57:39.679 align:start position:0%
what is the difference between the
 
01:57:42.149 --> 01:57:42.159 align:start position:0%
police and fire why are those
 
01:57:45.189 --> 01:57:45.199 align:start position:0%
two numbers different and
 
01:57:48.149 --> 01:57:48.159 align:start position:0%
who actually stays longer out of those
 
01:57:49.430 --> 01:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
to group two
 
01:57:51.910 --> 01:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh is the fire stay longer or the police
 
01:57:52.950 --> 01:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
stay longer
 
01:57:56.550 --> 01:57:56.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of employment i can address
 
01:57:56.560 --> 01:57:56.870 align:start position:0%
in terms of employment i can address
that

01:57:56.870 --> 01:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:57:59.910 --> 01:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
um folks uh this is marty
 
01:58:03.830 --> 01:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
um the prior to 2011 the group two rates
 
01:58:05.510 --> 01:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
were the same they were both nine point
 
01:58:07.990 --> 01:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
three percent of pay for police and fire
 
01:58:11.750 --> 01:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh house bill two did create a a larger
 
01:58:14.390 --> 01:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
rate um employer country employee member
 
01:58:16.550 --> 01:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
contribution rate for fire
 
01:58:20.790 --> 01:58:20.800 align:start position:0%
um i was pretty much living in the
 
01:58:22.709 --> 01:58:22.719 align:start position:0%
basement that legislative session and i
 
01:58:22.719 --> 01:58:23.589 align:start position:0%
basement that legislative session and i
i

01:58:23.589 --> 01:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:58:25.830 --> 01:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
attended all the hearings i don't recall
 
01:58:27.750 --> 01:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
a stated rationale for why the
 
01:58:29.910 --> 01:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
difference between police and fire
 
01:58:31.430 --> 01:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
you know other than the fact that at
 
01:58:33.510 --> 01:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
that time 10 years ago the
 
01:58:37.030 --> 01:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
um fire plan as in as a component of the
 
01:58:38.390 --> 01:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
overall plan was was
 
01:58:41.109 --> 01:58:41.119 align:start position:0%
more poorly funded than the police plan
 
01:58:42.229 --> 01:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
uh but but i
 
01:58:43.990 --> 01:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
there wasn't a lot of discussion about
 
01:58:46.629 --> 01:58:46.639 align:start position:0%
why those numbers uh are disparate
 
01:58:48.950 --> 01:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
and an answer to your second question uh
 
01:58:50.470 --> 01:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
firefighters are
 
01:58:52.709 --> 01:58:52.719 align:start position:0%
among the longer they they tend to
 
01:58:55.589 --> 01:58:55.599 align:start position:0%
average out working longer than police
 
01:58:58.790 --> 01:58:58.800 align:start position:0%
um i i could get the averages for you i
 
01:59:01.990 --> 01:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
just um
 
01:59:04.310 --> 01:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
retirees who police and fire retirees
 
01:59:06.790 --> 01:59:06.800 align:start position:0%
retiring in 2019 the average service for
 
01:59:09.430 --> 01:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
a firefighter was 26 years
 
01:59:11.430 --> 01:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
and the average service for a police
 
01:59:13.189 --> 01:59:13.199 align:start position:0%
officer was 23
 
01:59:15.270 --> 01:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
um so they they do tend to work longer
 
01:59:15.280 --> 01:59:18.310 align:start position:0%
um so they they do tend to work longer
historically

01:59:18.310 --> 01:59:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:20.790 --> 01:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
i'll follow up if i may madam chair
 
01:59:22.229 --> 01:59:22.239 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:59:25.830 --> 01:59:25.840 align:start position:0%
so interpret my from what you told me my
 
01:59:28.070 --> 01:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
interpretation to tell my friends
 
01:59:30.229 --> 01:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
basically the firefighters are penalized
 
01:59:31.589 --> 01:59:31.599 align:start position:0%
within this system
 
01:59:33.910 --> 01:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
by paying more in the contribution rate
 
01:59:35.430 --> 01:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
even though they're staying longer and
 
01:59:35.440 --> 01:59:36.229 align:start position:0%
even though they're staying longer and
making

01:59:36.229 --> 01:59:36.239 align:start position:0%
making
 
01:59:38.550 --> 01:59:38.560 align:start position:0%
uh more heftier contributions to the
 
01:59:39.830 --> 01:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
retirement system
 
01:59:43.830 --> 01:59:43.840 align:start position:0%
than the other group two group
 
01:59:45.750 --> 01:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
i i would say it was a legislative
 
01:59:46.870 --> 01:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
decision and then
 
01:59:49.589 --> 01:59:49.599 align:start position:0%
you know we wouldn't nhrs wouldn't say
 
01:59:51.189 --> 01:59:51.199 align:start position:0%
you know whether it was fair or unfair
 
01:59:51.830 --> 01:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
but that was
 
01:59:52.950 --> 01:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
what what the majority of the
 
01:59:58.470 --> 01:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
legislature chose to enact back in 2011.
 
02:00:01.589 --> 02:00:01.599 align:start position:0%
representative thank you
 
02:00:04.950 --> 02:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
so um i don't fully understand that's a
 
02:00:07.430 --> 02:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
understatement the uh the layered uh
 
02:00:09.430 --> 02:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
approach to dealing with the
 
02:00:12.870 --> 02:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
um the unfunded uh liability and i'm not
 
02:00:14.470 --> 02:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
looking for a you know detailed
 
02:00:15.990 --> 02:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
presentation at this point
 
02:00:17.669 --> 02:00:17.679 align:start position:0%
but i have a general question that is
 
02:00:19.350 --> 02:00:19.360 align:start position:0%
that uh uh
 
02:00:21.430 --> 02:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
on the effect of it and that is you know
 
02:00:21.440 --> 02:00:22.950 align:start position:0%
on the effect of it and that is you know
assuming

02:00:22.950 --> 02:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
assuming
 
02:00:24.790 --> 02:00:24.800 align:start position:0%
you know that we don't change the rules
 
02:00:25.990 --> 02:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
and assuming the given
 
02:00:28.149 --> 02:00:28.159 align:start position:0%
assumptions play out when would we
 
02:00:32.470 --> 02:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:35.669 --> 02:00:35.679 align:start position:0%
um i'll take that uh this is george
 
02:00:39.030 --> 02:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
um the the reality is so there's now
 
02:00:40.550 --> 02:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
two different aspects to the
 
02:00:43.270 --> 02:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
amortization of unfunded liability
 
02:00:45.589 --> 02:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
the original unfunded liability that was
 
02:00:48.629 --> 02:00:48.639 align:start position:0%
sort of fixed at 2017
 
02:00:52.390 --> 02:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
um is we're now about 11 years into that
 
02:00:55.189 --> 02:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
so at 39 that original part of the
 
02:00:56.470 --> 02:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability
 
02:00:59.350 --> 02:00:59.360 align:start position:0%
should be at zero okay uh well what's
 
02:01:00.070 --> 02:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
that on this
 
02:01:03.189 --> 02:01:03.199 align:start position:0%
i missed the date 2039.
 
02:01:06.709 --> 02:01:06.719 align:start position:0%
thank you right so um
 
02:01:10.629 --> 02:01:10.639 align:start position:0%
but at 2039 there will be a series of
 
02:01:13.669 --> 02:01:13.679 align:start position:0%
layered amortization schedules that will
 
02:01:15.990 --> 02:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
depend on the gains and losses
 
02:01:19.030 --> 02:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
that occur between now and then and that
 
02:01:19.040 --> 02:01:19.589 align:start position:0%
that occur between now and then and that
number

02:01:19.589 --> 02:01:19.599 align:start position:0%
number
 
02:01:22.709 --> 02:01:22.719 align:start position:0%
will be is an unknown right now so that
 
02:01:25.430 --> 02:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
there could uh very well be an unfunded
 
02:01:27.830 --> 02:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
liability in 2039 depending upon the
 
02:01:29.430 --> 02:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
experience of the plan
 
02:01:31.750 --> 02:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
um starting with the last value
 
02:01:33.109 --> 02:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
valuation through the
 
02:01:35.589 --> 02:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
2039 date but there's no way at this
 
02:01:36.870 --> 02:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
point in time of telling you what that
 
02:01:42.950 --> 02:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:46.709 --> 02:01:46.719 align:start position:0%
all right um this is marty
 
02:01:49.750 --> 02:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
sorry follow up
 
02:01:52.790 --> 02:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
dylan martin well i'm sorry i just uh
 
02:01:55.510 --> 02:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to mention as well it was sort of
 
02:01:55.520 --> 02:01:56.310 align:start position:0%
wanted to mention as well it was sort of
a

02:01:56.310 --> 02:01:56.320 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:01:58.229 --> 02:01:58.239 align:start position:0%
quick cliff notes version of thinking
 
02:02:00.310 --> 02:02:00.320 align:start position:0%
added is when the amortization was put
 
02:02:00.320 --> 02:02:01.270 align:start position:0%
added is when the amortization was put
in

02:02:01.270 --> 02:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:02:05.910 --> 02:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
in legislation in 2007 beginning in 2010
 
02:02:08.790 --> 02:02:08.800 align:start position:0%
um the the intent was to be 100 funded
 
02:02:10.310 --> 02:02:10.320 align:start position:0%
by 2039
 
02:02:12.070 --> 02:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
though the layering was put in as a
 
02:02:13.589 --> 02:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the decennial
 
02:02:16.870 --> 02:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
commission back in 2017 because
 
02:02:19.430 --> 02:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
as you get closer to 2039 you'd be much
 
02:02:21.510 --> 02:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
more subject to market fluctuations you
 
02:02:22.149 --> 02:02:22.159 align:start position:0%
could have
 
02:02:23.510 --> 02:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
tremendous swings in employer
 
02:02:25.910 --> 02:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
contributions so the layering is sort of
 
02:02:27.830 --> 02:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
a safety valve it doesn't we won't be
 
02:02:30.470 --> 02:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
100 funded in 2039
 
02:02:31.990 --> 02:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
but there's there's there's sort of a
 
02:02:34.149 --> 02:02:34.159 align:start position:0%
manageable 20-year
 
02:02:36.229 --> 02:02:36.239 align:start position:0%
tranches to pay off you know or
 
02:02:38.390 --> 02:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
recognize future gains and losses
 
02:02:41.270 --> 02:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
so we wouldn't ever theoretically get to
 
02:02:42.550 --> 02:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
where we are now
 
02:02:44.790 --> 02:02:44.800 align:start position:0%
you know we'd be pretty close to 100 but
 
02:02:46.950 --> 02:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
those other layers would be paid off
 
02:02:49.669 --> 02:02:49.679 align:start position:0%
you know going forward so so the the
 
02:02:51.510 --> 02:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
intergenerational equity
 
02:02:53.589 --> 02:02:53.599 align:start position:0%
for taxpayers in different periods would
 
02:02:56.310 --> 02:02:56.320 align:start position:0%
would be more balanced than it is now
 
02:02:59.430 --> 02:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you the the other
 
02:03:01.910 --> 02:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
issue with respect to the layered
 
02:03:01.920 --> 02:03:03.030 align:start position:0%
issue with respect to the layered
amortization

02:03:03.030 --> 02:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
amortization
 
02:03:07.430 --> 02:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
is there was no provision in the statute
 
02:03:10.629 --> 02:03:10.639 align:start position:0%
as to how to amortize any gains and
 
02:03:13.030 --> 02:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
losses beyond 2039
 
02:03:15.109 --> 02:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
so what would have happened is every two
 
02:03:17.589 --> 02:03:17.599 align:start position:0%
years if there was a gain the rate would
 
02:03:19.669 --> 02:03:19.679 align:start position:0%
go down and you'd have to amortize that
 
02:03:19.679 --> 02:03:20.550 align:start position:0%
go down and you'd have to amortize that
immediately

02:03:20.550 --> 02:03:20.560 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
02:03:22.310 --> 02:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
there was a loss the rate would go up
 
02:03:24.229 --> 02:03:24.239 align:start position:0%
and you have to amortize that
 
02:03:26.149 --> 02:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
immediately so this 20-year layered
 
02:03:26.159 --> 02:03:27.270 align:start position:0%
immediately so this 20-year layered
ammonization

02:03:27.270 --> 02:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
ammonization
 
02:03:34.070 --> 02:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:39.030 --> 02:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:42.149 --> 02:03:42.159 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you madam chair um
 
02:03:43.910 --> 02:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
i know we're not changing slides here
 
02:03:45.189 --> 02:03:45.199 align:start position:0%
that would be a little helpful
 
02:03:48.470 --> 02:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
if uh if it matches what the topic is
 
02:03:51.589 --> 02:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
um but the you mentioned the
 
02:03:53.270 --> 02:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
for those especially that are that are
 
02:03:55.109 --> 02:03:55.119 align:start position:0%
new you mentioned the formation
 
02:04:00.790 --> 02:04:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:04.950 --> 02:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
the the agreement that was made in 1967
 
02:04:06.709 --> 02:04:06.719 align:start position:0%
looks a whole lot different
 
02:04:11.030 --> 02:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
than the makeup of the system today
 
02:04:12.390 --> 02:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
and i was wondering if you could just
 
02:04:14.910 --> 02:04:14.920 align:start position:0%
touch on the states the state's
 
02:04:18.470 --> 02:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility in 1967 when they
 
02:04:22.550 --> 02:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
when they created the nhrs
 
02:04:25.350 --> 02:04:25.360 align:start position:0%
versus what the state is doing as far as
 
02:04:26.550 --> 02:04:26.560 align:start position:0%
their responsibility
 
02:04:30.069 --> 02:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:32.709 --> 02:04:32.719 align:start position:0%
um marty i trust that question goes to
 
02:04:32.719 --> 02:04:33.350 align:start position:0%
um marty i trust that question goes to
the

02:04:33.350 --> 02:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:04:35.750 --> 02:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
subsidy of municipal local governmental
 
02:04:38.310 --> 02:04:38.320 align:start position:0%
rates so why don't you tackle that yeah
 
02:04:40.950 --> 02:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
i'm a bit of the class historian um at
 
02:04:42.870 --> 02:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
nhrs so
 
02:04:46.950 --> 02:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
when rsa 100a was enacted uh back in 67
 
02:04:48.709 --> 02:04:48.719 align:start position:0%
i've got an original law book the the
 
02:04:50.790 --> 02:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
whole statute was about 38 pages long
 
02:04:50.800 --> 02:04:51.270 align:start position:0%
whole statute was about 38 pages long
and

02:04:51.270 --> 02:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:04:53.589 --> 02:04:53.599 align:start position:0%
you know same margins now the the law
 
02:04:56.069 --> 02:04:56.079 align:start position:0%
books about 160 pages so there have been
 
02:04:56.079 --> 02:04:57.270 align:start position:0%
books about 160 pages so there have been
changes

02:04:57.270 --> 02:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
changes
 
02:04:59.910 --> 02:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
throughout the history of nhrs in terms
 
02:05:03.189 --> 02:05:03.199 align:start position:0%
of the state's obligation uh in 67
 
02:05:06.149 --> 02:05:06.159 align:start position:0%
um the state was paying 40 of the cost
 
02:05:06.159 --> 02:05:06.550 align:start position:0%
um the state was paying 40 of the cost
for

02:05:06.550 --> 02:05:06.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:05:10.069 --> 02:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
teachers um that was actually a remnant
 
02:05:11.350 --> 02:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
from the previous
 
02:05:13.830 --> 02:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
um legacy plan for teachers only you
 
02:05:15.109 --> 02:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
know the teachers retirement system
 
02:05:16.470 --> 02:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
they've been paying that at least since
 
02:05:19.270 --> 02:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
the early 50s as far back as i can tell
 
02:05:23.270 --> 02:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
um back in 1977 the legislature
 
02:05:25.109 --> 02:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
changed the subsidy so they were paying
 
02:05:25.119 --> 02:05:26.310 align:start position:0%
changed the subsidy so they were paying
35

02:05:26.310 --> 02:05:26.320 align:start position:0%
35
 
02:05:29.430 --> 02:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
for teachers police and fire and that
 
02:05:30.310 --> 02:05:30.320 align:start position:0%
was in effect
 
02:05:33.990 --> 02:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
um until 2009 1011 when the
 
02:05:35.990 --> 02:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
subsidy was ratcheted down from to 30
 
02:05:38.069 --> 02:05:38.079 align:start position:0%
percent one year 25 the next year and
 
02:05:38.079 --> 02:05:38.870 align:start position:0%
percent one year 25 the next year and
then

02:05:38.870 --> 02:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:05:38.880 --> 02:05:44.790 align:start position:0%
then
eliminated

02:05:44.790 --> 02:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:47.030 --> 02:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
representatives well i had a follow-up
 
02:05:48.390 --> 02:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
sorry i couldn't get to my
 
02:05:51.910 --> 02:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
on my channel i apologize
 
02:05:56.390 --> 02:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
um so just so i i i understand what
 
02:05:56.400 --> 02:05:56.870 align:start position:0%
um so just so i i i understand what
you're

02:05:56.870 --> 02:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
you're
 
02:05:59.990 --> 02:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:03.350 --> 02:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
the the makeup today is is substantially
 
02:06:03.360 --> 02:06:04.390 align:start position:0%
the the makeup today is is substantially
different

02:06:04.390 --> 02:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:06:07.270 --> 02:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
than the when the the retirement system
 
02:06:07.280 --> 02:06:07.750 align:start position:0%
than the when the the retirement system
was

02:06:07.750 --> 02:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:06:07.760 --> 02:06:10.870 align:start position:0%
was
formed

02:06:10.870 --> 02:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:12.629 --> 02:06:12.639 align:start position:0%
where the state has basically just
 
02:06:14.830 --> 02:06:14.840 align:start position:0%
abandoned its its agreed upon
 
02:06:14.840 --> 02:06:17.189 align:start position:0%
abandoned its its agreed upon
responsibility

02:06:17.189 --> 02:06:17.199 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
02:06:19.189 --> 02:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
if i'm if i'm following your math and
 
02:06:22.069 --> 02:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
calendars correctly here
 
02:06:22.079 --> 02:06:25.830 align:start position:0%
calendars correctly here
the

02:06:25.830 --> 02:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:28.709 --> 02:06:28.719 align:start position:0%
that did that have an effect on the
 
02:06:31.109 --> 02:06:31.119 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability or was that entirely
 
02:06:32.550 --> 02:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
downshifted to the
 
02:06:35.430 --> 02:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
to the local level if you will i know
 
02:06:36.790 --> 02:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
the state there's some state agencies
 
02:06:39.270 --> 02:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
involved but you get what i'm saying
 
02:06:41.669 --> 02:06:41.679 align:start position:0%
yeah it didn't change the liability it
 
02:06:43.189 --> 02:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
just shifted the cost
 
02:06:45.109 --> 02:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
um you know from the amount that the
 
02:06:46.390 --> 02:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
state was paying on behalf of the
 
02:06:48.870 --> 02:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities that cost moved over
 
02:06:51.350 --> 02:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
um so so you think about it you know the
 
02:06:52.069 --> 02:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
other way for
 
02:06:53.830 --> 02:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
for a number of years for teachers
 
02:06:55.669 --> 02:06:55.679 align:start position:0%
police and fire
 
02:06:57.189 --> 02:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
localities and school districts are
 
02:07:00.069 --> 02:07:00.079 align:start position:0%
paying 65 percent of what the total rate
 
02:07:01.750 --> 02:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
was and then ended up paying 100
 
02:07:04.790 --> 02:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
so that elimination of the 35 subsidy
 
02:07:05.750 --> 02:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
was about a 50
 
02:07:07.990 --> 02:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
increase in what their dollar amounts
 
02:07:09.189 --> 02:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
they were paying to the retirement
 
02:07:10.629 --> 02:07:10.639 align:start position:0%
system even though the liability
 
02:07:12.629 --> 02:07:12.639 align:start position:0%
remained the same and this
 
02:07:14.870 --> 02:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
change was um challenged by some
 
02:07:14.880 --> 02:07:16.229 align:start position:0%
change was um challenged by some
municipalities

02:07:16.229 --> 02:07:16.239 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
02:07:17.990 --> 02:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
and upheld by the supreme court i think
 
02:07:20.229 --> 02:07:20.239 align:start position:0%
that decision came out in maybe 10 or
 
02:07:20.239 --> 02:07:24.470 align:start position:0%
that decision came out in maybe 10 or
11.

02:07:24.470 --> 02:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:27.280 --> 02:07:27.290 align:start position:0%
representative show up thank you man
 
02:07:27.290 --> 02:07:28.950 align:start position:0%
representative show up thank you man
[Music]

02:07:28.950 --> 02:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:07:31.030 --> 02:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
i think this is a fairly simple question
 
02:07:32.550 --> 02:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
for mr murphy
 
02:07:35.270 --> 02:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh you mentioned that the mortality
 
02:07:35.280 --> 02:07:36.229 align:start position:0%
uh you mentioned that the mortality
rates

02:07:36.229 --> 02:07:36.239 align:start position:0%
rates
 
02:07:40.149 --> 02:07:40.159 align:start position:0%
had changed did those rates increase or
 
02:07:40.159 --> 02:07:45.510 align:start position:0%
had changed did those rates increase or
decrease

02:07:45.510 --> 02:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:47.830 --> 02:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
thanks representative stewart um
 
02:07:47.840 --> 02:07:48.950 align:start position:0%
thanks representative stewart um
basically

02:07:48.950 --> 02:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
basically
 
02:07:52.790 --> 02:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
the the experience mortality experience
 
02:07:56.310 --> 02:07:56.320 align:start position:0%
has improved um folks as we all have
 
02:07:56.320 --> 02:07:57.109 align:start position:0%
has improved um folks as we all have
heard

02:07:57.109 --> 02:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
heard
 
02:08:00.550 --> 02:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
from countless sources um folks are
 
02:08:04.709 --> 02:08:04.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:08.149 --> 02:08:08.159 align:start position:0%
as time goes on so that it was a cost
 
02:08:10.629 --> 02:08:10.639 align:start position:0%
there was a cost associated with the
 
02:08:12.149 --> 02:08:12.159 align:start position:0%
with the changes to the mortality
 
02:08:14.470 --> 02:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
assumptions you are correct
 
02:08:20.149 --> 02:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:23.270 --> 02:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:08:25.189 --> 02:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
uh mr crowley could you kindly give
 
02:08:26.790 --> 02:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
those dates again so into
 
02:08:30.149 --> 02:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
in in 67 40
 
02:08:33.830 --> 02:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
was for the teachers 40 of the cost
 
02:08:36.709 --> 02:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
plan was for teachers and then in 77 it
 
02:08:36.719 --> 02:08:37.030 align:start position:0%
plan was for teachers and then in 77 it
was

02:08:37.030 --> 02:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:08:40.069 --> 02:08:40.079 align:start position:0%
reduced to 35 but it included police and
 
02:08:40.079 --> 02:08:40.950 align:start position:0%
reduced to 35 but it included police and
fire

02:08:40.950 --> 02:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
fire
 
02:08:45.270 --> 02:08:45.280 align:start position:0%
and when did 25 when in 2011 did you say
 
02:08:49.109 --> 02:08:49.119 align:start position:0%
um i i believe the the legislation was
 
02:08:51.270 --> 02:08:51.280 align:start position:0%
passed in 09
 
02:08:54.870 --> 02:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
so fiscal 10 it was 30
 
02:08:58.310 --> 02:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal 11 it was a 25 subsidy
 
02:09:00.629 --> 02:09:00.639 align:start position:0%
and the original law that was enacted 09
 
02:09:02.629 --> 02:09:02.639 align:start position:0%
was restoring it to 35
 
02:09:05.430 --> 02:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
for fiscal 12 but the legislature in
 
02:09:05.440 --> 02:09:06.470 align:start position:0%
for fiscal 12 but the legislature in
2011

02:09:06.470 --> 02:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
2011
 
02:09:09.910 --> 02:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
eliminated the subsidy instead i i've
 
02:09:11.990 --> 02:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
got a i've got the
 
02:09:15.270 --> 02:09:15.280 align:start position:0%
sort of a white paper on this on the uh
 
02:09:17.030 --> 02:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
nhrs website and i'll send it over to
 
02:09:19.669 --> 02:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
pam to distribute to the committee if
 
02:09:21.910 --> 02:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
anyone's interested thank you i think
 
02:09:24.550 --> 02:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
there will be a lot of people interested
 
02:09:27.990 --> 02:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien thank you madam
 
02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:28.629 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien thank you madam
chair

02:09:28.629 --> 02:09:28.639 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:09:31.350 --> 02:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
um i think if i'm correct past
 
02:09:33.750 --> 02:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
legislators came up with
 
02:09:36.550 --> 02:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
people who did do some shift coverage or
 
02:09:37.990 --> 02:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
overtime work
 
02:09:41.750 --> 02:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh such as details and such and
 
02:09:44.790 --> 02:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
in the past that money uh when they got
 
02:09:46.470 --> 02:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
their pay for that
 
02:09:48.149 --> 02:09:48.159 align:start position:0%
uh in the group two particularly what
 
02:09:50.550 --> 02:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
we're talking about went into their
 
02:09:53.830 --> 02:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
retirement benefit but then i think
 
02:09:57.270 --> 02:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
that was kind of cut back and if it was
 
02:10:00.390 --> 02:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
cut back if somebody worked at overtime
 
02:10:02.390 --> 02:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
shift and yet the pension system did
 
02:10:02.400 --> 02:10:02.950 align:start position:0%
shift and yet the pension system did
take

02:10:02.950 --> 02:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
take
 
02:10:05.270 --> 02:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
a percentage the normal percentage out
 
02:10:05.990 --> 02:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
of that
 
02:10:09.910 --> 02:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh shift did that increase the unfunded
 
02:10:09.920 --> 02:10:11.030 align:start position:0%
uh shift did that increase the unfunded
liability

02:10:11.030 --> 02:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
liability
 
02:10:13.750 --> 02:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
when somebody's working uh 25 to 30
 
02:10:13.760 --> 02:10:14.629 align:start position:0%
when somebody's working uh 25 to 30
years

02:10:14.629 --> 02:10:14.639 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:10:17.350 --> 02:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
uh that's a substantial chunk of change
 
02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:18.550 align:start position:0%
uh that's a substantial chunk of change
that

02:10:18.550 --> 02:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:10:24.149 --> 02:10:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:30.470 --> 02:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:32.950 --> 02:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
it probably had an actuarial impact but
 
02:10:33.830 --> 02:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
it was it
 
02:10:35.750 --> 02:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
it you know it's sort of on the margins
 
02:10:37.510 --> 02:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
they i think the actuary
 
02:10:39.030 --> 02:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
looked at that particular aspect
 
02:10:41.350 --> 02:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
significantly but but for the record
 
02:10:43.750 --> 02:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
any uh police and fire members hired
 
02:10:45.910 --> 02:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
after july first of 11
 
02:10:48.229 --> 02:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
uh the detail pay doesn't count towards
 
02:10:50.470 --> 02:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
their pension calculation anymore and
 
02:10:52.709 --> 02:10:52.719 align:start position:0%
neither the member nor their employer
 
02:10:55.189 --> 02:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
pay contributions to nhrs on that money
 
02:10:55.990 --> 02:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
02:10:57.669 --> 02:10:57.679 align:start position:0%
it's considered non-pensionable
 
02:10:57.679 --> 02:11:05.669 align:start position:0%
it's considered non-pensionable
compensation

02:11:05.669 --> 02:11:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:07.589 --> 02:11:07.599 align:start position:0%
i don't see any more questions right now
 
02:11:11.910 --> 02:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:15.750 --> 02:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you madam chair so
 
02:11:18.709 --> 02:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
we're on slide 24. um some of these
 
02:11:18.719 --> 02:11:19.350 align:start position:0%
we're on slide 24. um some of these
issues

02:11:19.350 --> 02:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
issues
 
02:11:22.709 --> 02:11:22.719 align:start position:0%
were things we just talked about but
 
02:11:24.310 --> 02:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
why why did the board take the action
 
02:11:26.390 --> 02:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
they did well the actuarial
 
02:11:28.470 --> 02:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
experience over the past four years
 
02:11:29.990 --> 02:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
showed that the assumptions didn't
 
02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:30.950 align:start position:0%
showed that the assumptions didn't
support

02:11:30.950 --> 02:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
support
 
02:11:33.510 --> 02:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh the rates that were in place um the
 
02:11:35.669 --> 02:11:35.679 align:start position:0%
economic and investment forecasts that
 
02:11:37.270 --> 02:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
the board received
 
02:11:38.870 --> 02:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
showed that inflation was going to be
 
02:11:41.189 --> 02:11:41.199 align:start position:0%
very limited so therefore
 
02:11:43.910 --> 02:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
the interest rate had to be taken into
 
02:11:45.589 --> 02:11:45.599 align:start position:0%
consideration and also investment
 
02:11:45.599 --> 02:11:46.790 align:start position:0%
consideration and also investment
returns

02:11:46.790 --> 02:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
returns
 
02:11:49.510 --> 02:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
were universally seen by i think there
 
02:11:51.990 --> 02:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
were a total of 17 or 19
 
02:11:54.229 --> 02:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
different investment operations that
 
02:11:56.470 --> 02:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
were taken into consideration by
 
02:11:59.030 --> 02:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
our actuaries and then others by the
 
02:12:00.550 --> 02:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
investment committee as well
 
02:12:02.629 --> 02:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
but clearly all expectations for future
 
02:12:04.870 --> 02:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
returns were muted
 
02:12:07.030 --> 02:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
so on that basis a couple of the key
 
02:12:07.040 --> 02:12:07.990 align:start position:0%
so on that basis a couple of the key
assumptions

02:12:07.990 --> 02:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
assumptions
 
02:12:10.550 --> 02:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh were taken down and reduced and i
 
02:12:12.310 --> 02:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
think you all know the fed has
 
02:12:14.149 --> 02:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
indicated that zero interest is their
 
02:12:16.310 --> 02:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
target for the foreseeable future
 
02:12:18.069 --> 02:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
and i think we just saw that the most
 
02:12:19.910 --> 02:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
recent year was around one point four
 
02:12:19.920 --> 02:12:20.790 align:start position:0%
recent year was around one point four
percent

02:12:20.790 --> 02:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:12:23.830 --> 02:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
um so and we're at two now so um
 
02:12:25.750 --> 02:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
you know we're seeing what we're
 
02:12:27.990 --> 02:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
expecting to see in that regard
 
02:12:32.069 --> 02:12:32.079 align:start position:0%
um so uh that's what happened in terms
 
02:12:33.030 --> 02:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
of the analysis
 
02:12:34.950 --> 02:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
and then in terms of the why while the
 
02:12:36.709 --> 02:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
trustees are fiduciaries and they're
 
02:12:38.229 --> 02:12:38.239 align:start position:0%
subject to the constitutional legal
 
02:12:39.270 --> 02:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
requirements of
 
02:12:40.790 --> 02:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire constitution and
 
02:12:42.870 --> 02:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
100a to determine
 
02:12:44.950 --> 02:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
contribution rates by sound actuarial
 
02:12:46.629 --> 02:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
evaluation and practice
 
02:12:48.229 --> 02:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
and act solely in the interest of the
 
02:12:50.550 --> 02:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
plan participants and the beneficiaries
 
02:12:52.629 --> 02:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
so the trustees in fact were making the
 
02:12:53.830 --> 02:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
decisions that they're
 
02:13:00.830 --> 02:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:00.840 --> 02:13:02.550 align:start position:0%
 
slide

02:13:02.550 --> 02:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
slide
 
02:13:04.550 --> 02:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
so the primary drivers i think we've
 
02:13:05.910 --> 02:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
covered this but the assumed rate of
 
02:13:07.430 --> 02:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
return is almost always
 
02:13:09.910 --> 02:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
the the biggest impact in terms of
 
02:13:12.229 --> 02:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
contribution rates and that was reduced
 
02:13:14.550 --> 02:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
uh by a half of a percent from seven and
 
02:13:16.790 --> 02:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
a quarter to six seven five
 
02:13:19.350 --> 02:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
um we adopted updated post retirement
 
02:13:21.109 --> 02:13:21.119 align:start position:0%
mortality assumptions as we just
 
02:13:22.950 --> 02:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
discussed people are living longer
 
02:13:25.510 --> 02:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
but that increases the cost of the plan
 
02:13:27.030 --> 02:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
because obviously benefits have to be
 
02:13:28.550 --> 02:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
paid out
 
02:13:30.069 --> 02:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
for longer periods of time than
 
02:13:32.149 --> 02:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
anticipated and the payroll growth
 
02:13:33.669 --> 02:13:33.679 align:start position:0%
factor also
 
02:13:36.470 --> 02:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
um has been one that we've been trying
 
02:13:37.750 --> 02:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
to catch up to
 
02:13:39.189 --> 02:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
employment growth just hasn't been
 
02:13:41.109 --> 02:13:41.119 align:start position:0%
growing at the uh the rate
 
02:13:43.910 --> 02:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
as expected uh compensation hasn't been
 
02:13:44.950 --> 02:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
growing as the rate
 
02:13:47.669 --> 02:13:47.679 align:start position:0%
has been expected and that's been a
 
02:13:49.350 --> 02:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
particular problem with teachers because
 
02:13:50.550 --> 02:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
as you all know
 
02:13:53.189 --> 02:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
a number of pupils in the state has been
 
02:13:54.629 --> 02:13:54.639 align:start position:0%
diminishing over time
 
02:13:55.990 --> 02:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
and although it's not a one-to-one
 
02:13:57.430 --> 02:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
relationship that means the number of
 
02:14:01.109 --> 02:14:01.119 align:start position:0%
teachers has been decreasing as well
 
02:14:02.709 --> 02:14:02.719 align:start position:0%
additional influences on the rates
 
02:14:05.030 --> 02:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
although these are far more modest the
 
02:14:07.750 --> 02:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
the cola that was passed uh and which
 
02:14:09.750 --> 02:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
we're now paying out
 
02:14:12.390 --> 02:14:12.400 align:start position:0%
had had a marginal impact because it was
 
02:14:14.149 --> 02:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
agreed that it would be funded by future
 
02:14:14.159 --> 02:14:15.510 align:start position:0%
agreed that it would be funded by future
contributions

02:14:15.510 --> 02:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
contributions
 
02:14:18.149 --> 02:14:18.159 align:start position:0%
and then also layered amortization has a
 
02:14:19.189 --> 02:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
minor impact
 
02:14:21.030 --> 02:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
um and that's sort of a mitigating
 
02:14:22.550 --> 02:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
impact but because we're only in the
 
02:14:23.750 --> 02:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
first layer here
 
02:14:25.750 --> 02:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
that impact was somewhat nominal that
 
02:14:28.069 --> 02:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
will increase over time
 
02:14:29.910 --> 02:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of muting the impact of any
 
02:14:32.390 --> 02:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
particular economic cycle
 
02:14:37.350 --> 02:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:39.189 --> 02:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
so this slide i think gives you the
 
02:14:40.470 --> 02:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
graphic of
 
02:14:42.229 --> 02:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
where we are with regard to contribution
 
02:14:44.310 --> 02:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
rates and just to keep it simple
 
02:14:45.910 --> 02:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
we've got all the member categories on
 
02:14:47.510 --> 02:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
the left but if we just take
 
02:14:49.830 --> 02:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
state employees which is the the top
 
02:14:51.669 --> 02:14:51.679 align:start position:0%
line going across
 
02:14:55.030 --> 02:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
you can see the pension normal cost 2.58
 
02:14:57.990 --> 02:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
that's the actual cost of the benefit
 
02:14:58.000 --> 02:14:59.030 align:start position:0%
that's the actual cost of the benefit
itself

02:14:59.030 --> 02:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
itself
 
02:15:00.870 --> 02:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of what state employees will
 
02:15:02.470 --> 02:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
receive for a benefit what would that
 
02:15:02.480 --> 02:15:03.189 align:start position:0%
receive for a benefit what would that
cost

02:15:03.189 --> 02:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
cost
 
02:15:07.109 --> 02:15:07.119 align:start position:0%
2.58 of the employer contribution rate
 
02:15:10.629 --> 02:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
is what's there um
 
02:15:12.390 --> 02:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
then next to it you can see the unfunded
 
02:15:12.400 --> 02:15:13.750 align:start position:0%
then next to it you can see the unfunded
liability

02:15:13.750 --> 02:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
liability
 
02:15:16.709 --> 02:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
uh the unfunded liability is 11.17
 
02:15:18.550 --> 02:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
percent of the total employer rate so
 
02:15:19.430 --> 02:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
it's about
 
02:15:21.510 --> 02:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
in the shaded column you can see within
 
02:15:23.910 --> 02:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
that category it's 81
 
02:15:25.750 --> 02:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
what's being paid by employers is going
 
02:15:28.629 --> 02:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
to pay for that unfunded liability
 
02:15:31.910 --> 02:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
that debt medical subsidy is about three
 
02:15:33.189 --> 02:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
quarters of a percent
 
02:15:34.470 --> 02:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
and when you add it up the total
 
02:15:37.669 --> 02:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
employer rate right now is 14.53
 
02:15:39.669 --> 02:15:39.679 align:start position:0%
so again you can see that the actual
 
02:15:41.589 --> 02:15:41.599 align:start position:0%
cost of the benefit is nominal
 
02:15:43.270 --> 02:15:43.280 align:start position:0%
as compared to the overall cost of
 
02:15:44.470 --> 02:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
employers and that's why it's so
 
02:15:46.149 --> 02:15:46.159 align:start position:0%
important to stay on the path
 
02:15:49.350 --> 02:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
of extinguishing this unfunded liability
 
02:15:52.069 --> 02:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
over time and into making the actuarial
 
02:15:54.310 --> 02:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
adjustments that are required to
 
02:15:59.430 --> 02:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:02.550 --> 02:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
slide this slide is just intended to
 
02:16:03.109 --> 02:16:03.119 align:start position:0%
give some
 
02:16:05.430 --> 02:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
perspective or context for where new
 
02:16:07.189 --> 02:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire stands relative
 
02:16:09.430 --> 02:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh to the rest of the country so you can
 
02:16:11.510 --> 02:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
see our data goes across the top line
 
02:16:13.109 --> 02:16:13.119 align:start position:0%
this is a report
 
02:16:15.990 --> 02:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
published by fitch and for the purpose
 
02:16:18.149 --> 02:16:18.159 align:start position:0%
of doing this they equalize
 
02:16:20.629 --> 02:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
all the investment plans by assuming
 
02:16:22.550 --> 02:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
that their rate of return is six percent
 
02:16:24.790 --> 02:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
so in other words uh they adjust
 
02:16:26.629 --> 02:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
everybody's rate of return down to six
 
02:16:27.750 --> 02:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
percent so we're all
 
02:16:31.189 --> 02:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
it's apples to apples to my accounting
 
02:16:34.309 --> 02:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
um you can see that as a percent
 
02:16:36.790 --> 02:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
of personal income new hampshire's
 
02:16:40.230 --> 02:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
adjusted net pension liability is 1.5
 
02:16:43.750 --> 02:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
which ranks us 10th um
 
02:16:46.870 --> 02:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
in in the country so um
 
02:16:49.270 --> 02:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
that that's a very favorable place to be
 
02:16:51.509 --> 02:16:51.519 align:start position:0%
a and that's lowest to highest so that's
 
02:16:52.549 --> 02:16:52.559 align:start position:0%
that's a
 
02:16:54.870 --> 02:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
obviously compared to uh you can see
 
02:16:56.309 --> 02:16:56.319 align:start position:0%
we've identified
 
02:16:58.070 --> 02:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh the new england states with us and
 
02:16:59.830 --> 02:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
then the national average so we're well
 
02:17:02.070 --> 02:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
below the national average
 
02:17:03.830 --> 02:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
and you can see how we've compared to
 
02:17:05.589 --> 02:17:05.599 align:start position:0%
states like connecticut massachusetts
 
02:17:05.599 --> 02:17:06.070 align:start position:0%
states like connecticut massachusetts
where

02:17:06.070 --> 02:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:17:08.469 --> 02:17:08.479 align:start position:0%
the number is dramatically higher and
 
02:17:09.589 --> 02:17:09.599 align:start position:0%
then when you look at pension
 
02:17:09.599 --> 02:17:10.950 align:start position:0%
then when you look at pension
contributions

02:17:10.950 --> 02:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
contributions
 
02:17:13.110 --> 02:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
as a percent of direct general spending
 
02:17:14.750 --> 02:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
by state and local governments we're at
 
02:17:14.760 --> 02:17:16.629 align:start position:0%
by state and local governments we're at
3.91

02:17:16.629 --> 02:17:16.639 align:start position:0%
3.91
 
02:17:18.309 --> 02:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
and that basically puts us in the middle
 
02:17:19.830 --> 02:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
of the pack
 
02:17:23.349 --> 02:17:23.359 align:start position:0%
um so again this is um just
 
02:17:25.589 --> 02:17:25.599 align:start position:0%
offered by way of context in terms of
 
02:17:29.990 --> 02:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:33.030 --> 02:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
um this graph i i think is um
 
02:17:34.709 --> 02:17:34.719 align:start position:0%
there the next two graphs i'm going to
 
02:17:35.830 --> 02:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
talk about for a minute because i think
 
02:17:37.589 --> 02:17:37.599 align:start position:0%
they're very very important
 
02:17:39.589 --> 02:17:39.599 align:start position:0%
um this is the assumed rate of return
 
02:17:40.629 --> 02:17:40.639 align:start position:0%
discussion we had
 
02:17:42.469 --> 02:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
you know iris earned assumed rate of
 
02:17:44.070 --> 02:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
return is now
 
02:17:46.629 --> 02:17:46.639 align:start position:0%
uh six point seven five percent but if
 
02:17:48.870 --> 02:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
you go back to where we were in 2001 you
 
02:17:50.389 --> 02:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
can see we're at nine
 
02:17:53.110 --> 02:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
the blue bar that's below us that our
 
02:17:54.950 --> 02:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
rate of return is the line going across
 
02:17:57.429 --> 02:17:57.439 align:start position:0%
the page the bars going
 
02:17:59.830 --> 02:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
north and south so to speak represent
 
02:18:01.750 --> 02:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
what the average is
 
02:18:04.389 --> 02:18:04.399 align:start position:0%
as published by the national association
 
02:18:06.070 --> 02:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
of retirement system administrators
 
02:18:06.469 --> 02:18:06.479 align:start position:0%
which is
 
02:18:08.469 --> 02:18:08.479 align:start position:0%
nasra you'll probably come to hear that
 
02:18:09.509 --> 02:18:09.519 align:start position:0%
term a lot
 
02:18:11.270 --> 02:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
so you can see that we were being much
 
02:18:12.950 --> 02:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
more optimistic than the national
 
02:18:15.429 --> 02:18:15.439 align:start position:0%
average back then by almost a full point
 
02:18:17.429 --> 02:18:17.439 align:start position:0%
and then over time what we've done is
 
02:18:19.030 --> 02:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
we've adjusted our assumed rate of
 
02:18:19.040 --> 02:18:19.910 align:start position:0%
we've adjusted our assumed rate of
return

02:18:19.910 --> 02:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
return
 
02:18:23.110 --> 02:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
and we've come down uh first eight and a
 
02:18:25.030 --> 02:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
half then to seven and three quarters
 
02:18:26.549 --> 02:18:26.559 align:start position:0%
then seven and a quarter and six and
 
02:18:27.589 --> 02:18:27.599 align:start position:0%
three quarters
 
02:18:30.230 --> 02:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
so now we're actually less than the
 
02:18:31.990 --> 02:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
national average in terms of our assumed
 
02:18:33.190 --> 02:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
rate of return
 
02:18:35.429 --> 02:18:35.439 align:start position:0%
um the last time we adjusted when we
 
02:18:37.190 --> 02:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
came down to seven and a quarter you can
 
02:18:40.070 --> 02:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
see in 2015
 
02:18:42.629 --> 02:18:42.639 align:start position:0%
we dropped down that seven and a quarter
 
02:18:43.429 --> 02:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
uh put us
 
02:18:45.990 --> 02:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
at below what the average was but you
 
02:18:47.830 --> 02:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
can see the average caught back up to us
 
02:18:47.840 --> 02:18:48.389 align:start position:0%
can see the average caught back up to us
in

02:18:48.389 --> 02:18:48.399 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:18:51.589 --> 02:18:51.599 align:start position:0%
18 and now in 19
 
02:18:52.870 --> 02:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
because we've adjusted again we've
 
02:18:55.190 --> 02:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
dropped below so what that means is the
 
02:18:57.030 --> 02:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
board over that period of time has taken
 
02:18:59.429 --> 02:18:59.439 align:start position:0%
the steps to be conservative in its
 
02:19:01.509 --> 02:19:01.519 align:start position:0%
views on the assumed rate of return and
 
02:19:03.270 --> 02:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
has frankly been right the trend has
 
02:19:04.950 --> 02:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
been coming down over time
 
02:19:07.030 --> 02:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
and the board is making the adjustments
 
02:19:09.110 --> 02:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
on a timely basis which is what the
 
02:19:09.120 --> 02:19:09.589 align:start position:0%
on a timely basis which is what the
board

02:19:09.589 --> 02:19:09.599 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:19:12.070 --> 02:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
i think is charged to do uh under the
 
02:19:12.950 --> 02:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
law and by
 
02:19:14.629 --> 02:19:14.639 align:start position:0%
fiduciary duty so they've done a very
 
02:19:17.509 --> 02:19:17.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:20.790 --> 02:19:20.800 align:start position:0%
next slide so
 
02:19:23.750 --> 02:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
this line i think really tells um a very
 
02:19:26.070 --> 02:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
positive story about what's happened
 
02:19:27.589 --> 02:19:27.599 align:start position:0%
over the past 10 years in terms of
 
02:19:29.830 --> 02:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
funding the plan the top line
 
02:19:33.270 --> 02:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
is what our peers have done so if you go
 
02:19:35.349 --> 02:19:35.359 align:start position:0%
back to 2010 the average
 
02:19:38.469 --> 02:19:38.479 align:start position:0%
um funded ratio for
 
02:19:41.429 --> 02:19:41.439 align:start position:0%
our peers was 77.1 so there's no doubt
 
02:19:43.030 --> 02:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
we've had a funding problem
 
02:19:44.309 --> 02:19:44.319 align:start position:0%
going back to the date when we
 
02:19:45.910 --> 02:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
recognized what our true unfunded
 
02:19:47.669 --> 02:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
liability was
 
02:19:49.429 --> 02:19:49.439 align:start position:0%
you know following the recognition that
 
02:19:51.830 --> 02:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
the actuarial methodology was
 
02:19:51.840 --> 02:19:53.349 align:start position:0%
the actuarial methodology was
inappropriate

02:19:53.349 --> 02:19:53.359 align:start position:0%
inappropriate
 
02:19:55.110 --> 02:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
but over that time period you can see
 
02:19:57.990 --> 02:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
that we've had a very gradual
 
02:20:00.150 --> 02:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
but positive increase in our assumed
 
02:20:01.429 --> 02:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
rate of return
 
02:20:04.230 --> 02:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
even though we've taken steps excuse me
 
02:20:05.510 --> 02:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
in our funded ratio
 
02:20:07.190 --> 02:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
even though we've taken steps to reduce
 
02:20:08.870 --> 02:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
our assumed rate of return
 
02:20:10.630 --> 02:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
and as you all know when we when we make
 
02:20:12.710 --> 02:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
reductions in our assumed rate of return
 
02:20:14.710 --> 02:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
a funded ratio comes down because our
 
02:20:16.150 --> 02:20:16.160 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability goes
 
02:20:18.950 --> 02:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
up if you look at our peer group over
 
02:20:20.630 --> 02:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
that period of time
 
02:20:22.830 --> 02:20:22.840 align:start position:0%
their funded ratio has come down from
 
02:20:24.710 --> 02:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
77.1 to 72
 
02:20:27.190 --> 02:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
4. so it's been an improvement a
 
02:20:28.790 --> 02:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
relatively modest one
 
02:20:30.710 --> 02:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
while ours has gone up over that time
 
02:20:32.710 --> 02:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
period so what that means is compared to
 
02:20:33.750 --> 02:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
our peers
 
02:20:35.910 --> 02:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
we've taken more positive steps to
 
02:20:38.309 --> 02:20:38.319 align:start position:0%
improve our funded level
 
02:20:42.150 --> 02:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
and so what was once a gap of about 19
 
02:20:42.160 --> 02:20:43.349 align:start position:0%
and so what was once a gap of about 19
percent

02:20:43.349 --> 02:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:20:45.190 --> 02:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
has come down dramatically so it's
 
02:20:47.590 --> 02:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
closer to about nine percent
 
02:20:49.429 --> 02:20:49.439 align:start position:0%
um the other thing i want to mention as
 
02:20:51.030 --> 02:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
well is that
 
02:20:53.830 --> 02:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
our current rate excuse me it's it's
 
02:20:55.030 --> 02:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
60.8 it's
 
02:20:58.309 --> 02:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
about 11 11.4 uh the other thing i want
 
02:20:59.830 --> 02:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
to mention though is
 
02:21:02.630 --> 02:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
had we not adjusted our assumed rate of
 
02:21:05.270 --> 02:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
return this last time around
 
02:21:07.110 --> 02:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
and left it where it was at seven and a
 
02:21:09.510 --> 02:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
quarter uh seven and a quarter is about
 
02:21:11.030 --> 02:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
the average right now for all those
 
02:21:12.710 --> 02:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
other plans that are above us on that
 
02:21:12.720 --> 02:21:13.750 align:start position:0%
other plans that are above us on that
line

02:21:13.750 --> 02:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
line
 
02:21:17.630 --> 02:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
our our uh funding ratio would have been
 
02:21:17.640 --> 02:21:19.830 align:start position:0%
our our uh funding ratio would have been
64.1

02:21:19.830 --> 02:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
64.1
 
02:21:22.550 --> 02:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
which would have made us even closer uh
 
02:21:23.990 --> 02:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
to the average than we've ever been
 
02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:24.950 align:start position:0%
to the average than we've ever been
before

02:21:24.950 --> 02:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
before
 
02:21:27.110 --> 02:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
so we have in fact been strengthening
 
02:21:29.270 --> 02:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
the plan over that period of time
 
02:21:31.830 --> 02:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
which i think is a very positive message
 
02:21:33.030 --> 02:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
and it shows that the
 
02:21:35.750 --> 02:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
plan that we have in place is in fact
 
02:21:35.760 --> 02:21:36.550 align:start position:0%
plan that we have in place is in fact
working

02:21:36.550 --> 02:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
working
 
02:21:38.870 --> 02:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
and the board i think is meeting its um
 
02:21:38.880 --> 02:21:40.550 align:start position:0%
and the board i think is meeting its um
responsibilities

02:21:40.550 --> 02:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
02:21:42.870 --> 02:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
one other footnote to this slide it's
 
02:21:45.110 --> 02:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
not directly related to the slide but
 
02:21:48.070 --> 02:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
you know the rating agencies take a look
 
02:21:49.590 --> 02:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
at all public pension plans and they
 
02:21:51.429 --> 02:21:51.439 align:start position:0%
comment on ours as well
 
02:21:54.230 --> 02:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
and you know in new hampshire has very
 
02:21:56.230 --> 02:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
strong financial position i think and i
 
02:21:57.830 --> 02:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
think the rating agencies appreciate
 
02:21:59.030 --> 02:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
that but one of the
 
02:22:00.950 --> 02:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
things they always express some concern
 
02:22:02.710 --> 02:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
about some more than others is
 
02:22:04.790 --> 02:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
you know the funded ratio of the plan
 
02:22:07.110 --> 02:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
and s p in their most recent report said
 
02:22:07.120 --> 02:22:08.469 align:start position:0%
and s p in their most recent report said
that

02:22:08.469 --> 02:22:08.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:22:10.389 --> 02:22:10.399 align:start position:0%
even though they expressed concern with
 
02:22:11.510 --> 02:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
our funding level
 
02:22:13.349 --> 02:22:13.359 align:start position:0%
the quote from them was we believe the
 
02:22:15.190 --> 02:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
state's funding discipline including a
 
02:22:16.550 --> 02:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
commitment to funding
 
02:22:18.870 --> 02:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
at the full annual pension contribution
 
02:22:21.590 --> 02:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
level that exceeds static funding levels
 
02:22:23.910 --> 02:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
as likely to improve pension funding
 
02:22:25.270 --> 02:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
trajectory over time
 
02:22:27.270 --> 02:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
so you know this is something the rating
 
02:22:29.190 --> 02:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
agencies look at and i think
 
02:22:31.190 --> 02:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
um the actions of the board over this
 
02:22:32.630 --> 02:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
period of time
 
02:22:36.150 --> 02:22:36.160 align:start position:0%
have been positive in that respect
 
02:22:36.160 --> 02:22:40.150 align:start position:0%
have been positive in that respect
slide

02:22:40.150 --> 02:22:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:43.349 --> 02:22:43.359 align:start position:0%
so the key takeaways um you know the
 
02:22:44.389 --> 02:22:44.399 align:start position:0%
board has got
 
02:22:46.309 --> 02:22:46.319 align:start position:0%
legal and constitutional requirements
 
02:22:48.389 --> 02:22:48.399 align:start position:0%
with recur with regard to the funding of
 
02:22:51.110 --> 02:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
the plan and determining rates
 
02:22:54.070 --> 02:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
the decisions were made at the last
 
02:22:56.550 --> 02:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
experience study were necessary
 
02:22:58.389 --> 02:22:58.399 align:start position:0%
to properly fund the plan over the long
 
02:22:58.399 --> 02:23:00.389 align:start position:0%
to properly fund the plan over the long
term

02:23:00.389 --> 02:23:00.399 align:start position:0%
term
 
02:23:02.309 --> 02:23:02.319 align:start position:0%
the fact that employer contribution
 
02:23:02.319 --> 02:23:03.830 align:start position:0%
the fact that employer contribution
rates

02:23:03.830 --> 02:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
rates
 
02:23:05.990 --> 02:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
strengthen the plan that means that it
 
02:23:08.230 --> 02:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
positions the plan better to withstand
 
02:23:10.790 --> 02:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
to withstand economic downturns and it
 
02:23:13.030 --> 02:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
also promotes intergenerational equity
 
02:23:14.870 --> 02:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
which in plain english means that
 
02:23:17.349 --> 02:23:17.359 align:start position:0%
by not kicking down kicking the can down
 
02:23:18.790 --> 02:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
the road so to speak
 
02:23:20.309 --> 02:23:20.319 align:start position:0%
um the people who are paying for the
 
02:23:22.309 --> 02:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
benefits now and paying
 
02:23:25.590 --> 02:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
as employers and members um are paying
 
02:23:27.190 --> 02:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
in line with the benefit payout as
 
02:23:28.630 --> 02:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
opposed to pushing the debt
 
02:23:30.150 --> 02:23:30.160 align:start position:0%
further down for other people in the
 
02:23:32.469 --> 02:23:32.479 align:start position:0%
future to pay off
 
02:23:34.309 --> 02:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
one very important point i want to
 
02:23:35.830 --> 02:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
mention is you know
 
02:23:38.389 --> 02:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
these changes don't really change the
 
02:23:40.469 --> 02:23:40.479 align:start position:0%
cost of the plans
 
02:23:43.030 --> 02:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
only the timing of the payments the only
 
02:23:44.710 --> 02:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
way they actually change the cost of the
 
02:23:45.670 --> 02:23:45.680 align:start position:0%
plan as if
 
02:23:47.510 --> 02:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
the changes aren't made on a timely
 
02:23:49.510 --> 02:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
basis that does in effect
 
02:23:51.670 --> 02:23:51.680 align:start position:0%
increase the unfunded liability over and
 
02:23:53.590 --> 02:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
above what it would otherwise be
 
02:23:55.910 --> 02:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
so it really is very much i won't call
 
02:23:57.750 --> 02:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
it a game but it very much is a case of
 
02:24:00.230 --> 02:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
paying me now or pay me later and
 
02:24:01.510 --> 02:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
you know one thing that we've seen
 
02:24:04.070 --> 02:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
historically is that pay me later
 
02:24:07.590 --> 02:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
is a is a very bad place to be so
 
02:24:09.270 --> 02:24:09.280 align:start position:0%
i think that's a very important message
 
02:24:13.030 --> 02:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:15.110 --> 02:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
um that's uh i'm going to be handing it
 
02:24:16.790 --> 02:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
back over to marty
 
02:24:19.990 --> 02:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
here um and before i do i'm happy to
 
02:24:23.910 --> 02:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:29.590 --> 02:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
i don't see any specific questions so uh
 
02:24:33.349 --> 02:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
marty you can finish up okay
 
02:24:36.150 --> 02:24:36.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um we are close to
 
02:24:37.590 --> 02:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
the end i'm sure folks are getting a
 
02:24:38.710 --> 02:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
little bit hungry
 
02:24:41.429 --> 02:24:41.439 align:start position:0%
a couple of slides on legislation uh
 
02:24:42.230 --> 02:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
just sort of wrap
 
02:24:44.790 --> 02:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
up what's been going on uh last year
 
02:24:46.550 --> 02:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
there were 13 bills related to the
 
02:24:48.550 --> 02:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
retirement system introduced
 
02:24:50.230 --> 02:24:50.240 align:start position:0%
all of which i think all the house bills
 
02:24:51.910 --> 02:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
went through edna
 
02:24:53.830 --> 02:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
nothing was enacted last year which is a
 
02:24:53.840 --> 02:24:55.270 align:start position:0%
nothing was enacted last year which is a
fairly

02:24:55.270 --> 02:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
fairly
 
02:24:58.389 --> 02:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
rare occurrence a couple of bills did
 
02:25:00.389 --> 02:25:00.399 align:start position:0%
pass through the house and died in the
 
02:25:02.150 --> 02:25:02.160 align:start position:0%
senate omnibus bills that the governor
 
02:25:02.160 --> 02:25:03.030 align:start position:0%
senate omnibus bills that the governor
vetoed

02:25:03.030 --> 02:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
vetoed
 
02:25:05.990 --> 02:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
last fall because of coven this year so
 
02:25:08.309 --> 02:25:08.319 align:start position:0%
far we've seen nine lsrs
 
02:25:10.950 --> 02:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
posted related to the retirement system
 
02:25:10.960 --> 02:25:11.349 align:start position:0%
posted related to the retirement system
seven

02:25:11.349 --> 02:25:11.359 align:start position:0%
seven
 
02:25:13.830 --> 02:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
in the house and two in the senate um
 
02:25:16.389 --> 02:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
many of the house lsrs have one or more
 
02:25:18.070 --> 02:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
sponsors on this committee
 
02:25:20.150 --> 02:25:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh some couple of them are repeat bills
 
02:25:21.830 --> 02:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
from last year and or from prior
 
02:25:21.840 --> 02:25:22.710 align:start position:0%
from last year and or from prior
sessions

02:25:22.710 --> 02:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
sessions
 
02:25:24.790 --> 02:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
so you've got a good base of knowledge
 
02:25:26.150 --> 02:25:26.160 align:start position:0%
on that everything
 
02:25:28.469 --> 02:25:28.479 align:start position:0%
i've seen except one is going to edna
 
02:25:30.070 --> 02:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
this year one other bill that that the
 
02:25:31.910 --> 02:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
committee saw in 18 was assigned to
 
02:25:33.429 --> 02:25:33.439 align:start position:0%
education this year
 
02:25:36.150 --> 02:25:36.160 align:start position:0%
um and i'll follow that over there um
 
02:25:38.550 --> 02:25:38.560 align:start position:0%
since 2007 and again i was
 
02:25:39.750 --> 02:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
talking about that as sort of the
 
02:25:41.830 --> 02:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
beginning of the beginning in terms of
 
02:25:41.840 --> 02:25:42.550 align:start position:0%
beginning of the beginning in terms of
uh

02:25:42.550 --> 02:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:25:44.950 --> 02:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
getting nhrs short up moving forward
 
02:25:46.710 --> 02:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
there's been over 100 changes to the
 
02:25:46.720 --> 02:25:47.590 align:start position:0%
there's been over 100 changes to the
plan

02:25:47.590 --> 02:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
plan
 
02:25:50.550 --> 02:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
through legislation since then um some
 
02:25:52.230 --> 02:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
significant like the contribution
 
02:25:54.790 --> 02:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
rates the state subsidy um things like
 
02:25:56.710 --> 02:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
that and others that are fairly minor or
 
02:25:58.150 --> 02:25:58.160 align:start position:0%
administrative or
 
02:25:59.910 --> 02:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
affect a small pool of people but
 
02:26:01.429 --> 02:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
cumulatively you've kept
 
02:26:05.590 --> 02:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
us busy i guess is the takeaway there um
 
02:26:07.349 --> 02:26:07.359 align:start position:0%
and just just to clarify for the newer
 
02:26:09.830 --> 02:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
members you know our our role in nhrs
 
02:26:12.389 --> 02:26:12.399 align:start position:0%
staff is to provide you with data and
 
02:26:14.309 --> 02:26:14.319 align:start position:0%
objective analysis either internal or
 
02:26:16.309 --> 02:26:16.319 align:start position:0%
prepared by our actuary
 
02:26:18.389 --> 02:26:18.399 align:start position:0%
uh we do that by submitting fiscal note
 
02:26:20.070 --> 02:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
worksheets to lba
 
02:26:23.270 --> 02:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh for them uh to put with the bills uh
 
02:26:24.950 --> 02:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
we do something called bill briefs which
 
02:26:26.790 --> 02:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
are handouts on
 
02:26:28.630 --> 02:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
more complicated bills or bills that
 
02:26:30.550 --> 02:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
have a history so you've got some
 
02:26:32.469 --> 02:26:32.479 align:start position:0%
information at your fingertips
 
02:26:34.870 --> 02:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
we we testify on most bills not in
 
02:26:36.150 --> 02:26:36.160 align:start position:0%
support or
 
02:26:37.830 --> 02:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
against but just for informational
 
02:26:39.270 --> 02:26:39.280 align:start position:0%
purposes um
 
02:26:40.790 --> 02:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
and then the informational materials
 
02:26:43.030 --> 02:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
that we can provide uh as needed
 
02:26:46.309 --> 02:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
annual reports etc so so we really try
 
02:26:47.429 --> 02:26:47.439 align:start position:0%
to be you know
 
02:26:50.070 --> 02:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
switzerland in a sense we uh don't want
 
02:26:51.349 --> 02:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
to take a position
 
02:26:54.150 --> 02:26:54.160 align:start position:0%
on matters that are left to the
 
02:26:56.070 --> 02:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
legislature completely that basically
 
02:26:56.080 --> 02:26:56.630 align:start position:0%
legislature completely that basically
planted

02:26:56.630 --> 02:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
planted
 
02:26:59.830 --> 02:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
um settler functions um you know you you
 
02:26:59.840 --> 02:27:00.630 align:start position:0%
um settler functions um you know you you
folks

02:27:00.630 --> 02:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
folks
 
02:27:03.270 --> 02:27:03.280 align:start position:0%
decide when people can retire and how
 
02:27:04.469 --> 02:27:04.479 align:start position:0%
much they're going to pay and how long
 
02:27:05.750 --> 02:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
they have to work and all that kind of
 
02:27:06.309 --> 02:27:06.319 align:start position:0%
stuff so
 
02:27:08.309 --> 02:27:08.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to give you the numbers so
 
02:27:09.830 --> 02:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
you can make a you know a reasoned
 
02:27:11.670 --> 02:27:11.680 align:start position:0%
decision based on facts
 
02:27:13.510 --> 02:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
and not sort of put our thumb on the
 
02:27:14.950 --> 02:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
scale the only time
 
02:27:17.510 --> 02:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
nhrs does take a position on legislation
 
02:27:19.349 --> 02:27:19.359 align:start position:0%
is when the board feels that
 
02:27:21.670 --> 02:27:21.680 align:start position:0%
legislation may intrude on their
 
02:27:21.680 --> 02:27:22.790 align:start position:0%
legislation may intrude on their
fiduciary

02:27:22.790 --> 02:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
fiduciary
 
02:27:25.110 --> 02:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
duties or maybe constitutional or
 
02:27:26.630 --> 02:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
internal revenue code
 
02:27:29.750 --> 02:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh problematic with those um documents
 
02:27:29.760 --> 02:27:30.469 align:start position:0%
uh problematic with those um documents
so

02:27:30.469 --> 02:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:27:32.550 --> 02:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
again um we are kind of heading to the
 
02:27:34.389 --> 02:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
end but we'll go one last slide for
 
02:27:34.399 --> 02:27:34.870 align:start position:0%
end but we'll go one last slide for
george

02:27:34.870 --> 02:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
george
 
02:27:37.670 --> 02:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
to um bring it all home but if anybody
 
02:27:39.750 --> 02:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
has any questions about legislative
 
02:27:39.760 --> 02:27:40.309 align:start position:0%
has any questions about legislative
matters

02:27:40.309 --> 02:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
matters
 
02:27:47.670 --> 02:27:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:55.830 --> 02:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:59.030 --> 02:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
thank you marty so i i'll just wrap up
 
02:28:00.230 --> 02:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
quickly and then i'll just give you a
 
02:28:02.389 --> 02:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
very quick update on where we are
 
02:28:06.550 --> 02:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
on the executive director search so
 
02:28:08.710 --> 02:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
a concluding message is that i think as
 
02:28:10.070 --> 02:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
you've seen
 
02:28:11.429 --> 02:28:11.439 align:start position:0%
the retirement system provides a
 
02:28:13.830 --> 02:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
relatively modest pension benefit
 
02:28:16.469 --> 02:28:16.479 align:start position:0%
um and those benefits that get paid 80
 
02:28:18.389 --> 02:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
of them do remain in state in terms of
 
02:28:21.990 --> 02:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
the local economy um there is a plan in
 
02:28:24.070 --> 02:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
place to pay down the unfunded liability
 
02:28:26.070 --> 02:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
and to manage future viability i
 
02:28:29.190 --> 02:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
i think it's a good plan it's worked
 
02:28:29.830 --> 02:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
well and
 
02:28:32.870 --> 02:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
and the charts i provided that we looked
 
02:28:33.670 --> 02:28:33.680 align:start position:0%
at i think
 
02:28:37.270 --> 02:28:37.280 align:start position:0%
show that we are in fact on the path
 
02:28:39.110 --> 02:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
and now that we're 10 years into that
 
02:28:40.790 --> 02:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
amortization schedule
 
02:28:43.990 --> 02:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
because there's a crossover point um we
 
02:28:45.990 --> 02:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
should actually should be seeing more
 
02:28:47.030 --> 02:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
and more progress
 
02:28:48.870 --> 02:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of improving the funded ratio
 
02:28:50.150 --> 02:28:50.160 align:start position:0%
as compared to what's happened over the
 
02:28:52.070 --> 02:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
past 10 years
 
02:28:55.429 --> 02:28:55.439 align:start position:0%
the board has been acting in a fiduciary
 
02:28:57.670 --> 02:28:57.680 align:start position:0%
manner and taking the proper steps to
 
02:28:59.590 --> 02:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
assure proper planned funding
 
02:29:01.270 --> 02:29:01.280 align:start position:0%
and that's reflected in the decisions
 
02:29:02.469 --> 02:29:02.479 align:start position:0%
they've made with the guide to the
 
02:29:05.270 --> 02:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
assumed greater return over the 10 years
 
02:29:07.030 --> 02:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
and as indicated the improvement in the
 
02:29:08.309 --> 02:29:08.319 align:start position:0%
funded ratio
 
02:29:11.190 --> 02:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
relative to our peers despite the impact
 
02:29:13.750 --> 02:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
of those reductions on
 
02:29:17.110 --> 02:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
the funded ratio and finally you know my
 
02:29:17.990 --> 02:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
comment earlier
 
02:29:20.070 --> 02:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
uh those of you who have been around for
 
02:29:21.510 --> 02:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
the last nine years have heard me say on
 
02:29:23.190 --> 02:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
more than one occasion that it is a
 
02:29:24.950 --> 02:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
movie and it's not a slide or
 
02:29:27.830 --> 02:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
one frame um you can say it's a marathon
 
02:29:28.950 --> 02:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
and not a sprint
 
02:29:31.670 --> 02:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
um there aren't any shortcuts and we all
 
02:29:33.349 --> 02:29:33.359 align:start position:0%
have we always have to be careful about
 
02:29:35.190 --> 02:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
snapshots because they prevent you know
 
02:29:36.309 --> 02:29:36.319 align:start position:0%
they present
 
02:29:38.230 --> 02:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
a very narrow slice of what the bigger
 
02:29:40.469 --> 02:29:40.479 align:start position:0%
picture is and what's important is how
 
02:29:41.910 --> 02:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
we do over time
 
02:29:43.830 --> 02:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
and uh i think the last 10 years have
 
02:29:45.349 --> 02:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
shown that we're making good progress
 
02:29:45.359 --> 02:29:46.630 align:start position:0%
shown that we're making good progress
and

02:29:46.630 --> 02:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:29:48.230 --> 02:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
although i'm not going to be here to see
 
02:29:50.230 --> 02:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
it i am retiring uh
 
02:29:53.110 --> 02:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
at the end of february i'm hopeful that
 
02:29:53.120 --> 02:29:53.830 align:start position:0%
at the end of february i'm hopeful that
um

02:29:53.830 --> 02:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:55.590 --> 02:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to stay on the plan for
 
02:29:57.590 --> 02:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
the next 20 years and achieve that
 
02:29:57.600 --> 02:29:58.790 align:start position:0%
the next 20 years and achieve that
objective

02:29:58.790 --> 02:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
objective
 
02:30:01.349 --> 02:30:01.359 align:start position:0%
um so the last thing i want to say is um
 
02:30:03.190 --> 02:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
i i have been with the system for nine
 
02:30:04.870 --> 02:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
years it's been an honor and privilege
 
02:30:06.389 --> 02:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
uh to work with the folks at the
 
02:30:08.150 --> 02:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
retirement system and just
 
02:30:10.630 --> 02:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
and to serve the state in that regard uh
 
02:30:12.150 --> 02:30:12.160 align:start position:0%
i'm proud of the progress we've made
 
02:30:13.270 --> 02:30:13.280 align:start position:0%
it's been
 
02:30:15.110 --> 02:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
very certainly been very interesting and
 
02:30:16.710 --> 02:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
challenging experience over that period
 
02:30:18.630 --> 02:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
of time
 
02:30:21.990 --> 02:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
we're uh pretty deep into the search now
 
02:30:23.190 --> 02:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
for a replacement
 
02:30:24.710 --> 02:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
in fact we have a meeting this afternoon
 
02:30:26.070 --> 02:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
with the personnel committee for a
 
02:30:27.910 --> 02:30:27.920 align:start position:0%
couple of hours to review
 
02:30:29.990 --> 02:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
a short list of candidates that we have
 
02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:30.950 align:start position:0%
a short list of candidates that we have
from

02:30:30.950 --> 02:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:30:34.230 --> 02:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
all across the country so we're making
 
02:30:35.750 --> 02:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
good progress and um
 
02:30:37.190 --> 02:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
we expect to be able to come to a
 
02:30:39.510 --> 02:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
decision in the very near term
 
02:30:42.150 --> 02:30:42.160 align:start position:0%
so i thank you for all your service and
 
02:30:47.030 --> 02:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take any questions
 
02:30:50.710 --> 02:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
i have a question yes representative
 
02:30:50.720 --> 02:30:52.309 align:start position:0%
i have a question yes representative

02:57:22.790 --> 02:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
of course of course happy to do that is
 
02:57:23.429 --> 02:57:23.439 align:start position:0%

02:57:27.910 --> 02:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
can um can you see those slides
 
02:57:31.590 --> 02:57:31.600 align:start position:0%
excellent excellent alrighty so
 
02:57:34.550 --> 02:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
um just by way of background oplc is a
 
02:57:36.070 --> 02:57:36.080 align:start position:0%
very uh fairly new
 
02:57:37.990 --> 02:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
agency to the state of new hampshire was
 
02:57:40.950 --> 02:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
formed in 2015 under governor hassan
 
02:57:44.309 --> 02:57:44.319 align:start position:0%
um prior to its creation we had
 
02:57:45.990 --> 02:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
the majority of the technical licensing
 
02:57:47.830 --> 02:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
boards had been previously consolidated
 
02:57:50.710 --> 02:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
with the joint boards as you may recall
 
02:57:52.950 --> 02:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
several of our health licensing boards
 
02:57:54.710 --> 02:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
were administratively attached to the
 
02:57:56.790 --> 02:57:56.800 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
02:57:58.550 --> 02:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
and then several boards operated
 
02:58:00.550 --> 02:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
independently so with
 
02:58:04.550 --> 02:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
hb2 the licensing boards the majority of
 
02:58:06.309 --> 02:58:06.319 align:start position:0%
the licensing boards were consolidated
 
02:58:07.670 --> 02:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
into the office of professional
 
02:58:07.680 --> 02:58:08.790 align:start position:0%
into the office of professional
licensure

02:58:08.790 --> 02:58:08.800 align:start position:0%
licensure
 
02:58:11.349 --> 02:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
and certification um with that obviously
 
02:58:13.110 --> 02:58:13.120 align:start position:0%
our positions and systems and funding
 
02:58:14.790 --> 02:58:14.800 align:start position:0%
transferred from other state
 
02:58:18.790 --> 02:58:18.800 align:start position:0%
boards and agencies um to the office
 
02:58:21.510 --> 02:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
the purpose is really set forth in rsa
 
02:58:21.520 --> 02:58:22.870 align:start position:0%
the purpose is really set forth in rsa
310a

02:58:22.870 --> 02:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
310a
 
02:58:24.469 --> 02:58:24.479 align:start position:0%
which is to promote efficiency and
 
02:58:26.070 --> 02:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
economy in the administration of the
 
02:58:28.070 --> 02:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
professional licensing boards
 
02:58:31.429 --> 02:58:31.439 align:start position:0%
i think what's important to note is that
 
02:58:33.030 --> 02:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the agency is not
 
02:58:34.710 --> 02:58:34.720 align:start position:0%
necessarily the purpose of the licensing
 
02:58:36.950 --> 02:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
boards the licensing boards all retain
 
02:58:37.429 --> 02:58:37.439 align:start position:0%
their own
 
02:58:40.150 --> 02:58:40.160 align:start position:0%
individual regulatory or authority over
 
02:58:40.160 --> 02:58:40.870 align:start position:0%
individual regulatory or authority over
the

02:58:40.870 --> 02:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:58:43.110 --> 02:58:43.120 align:start position:0%
professions that they regulate and
 
02:58:43.120 --> 02:58:44.630 align:start position:0%
professions that they regulate and
license

02:58:44.630 --> 02:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
license
 
02:58:46.710 --> 02:58:46.720 align:start position:0%
the office's goal is really to just
 
02:58:48.070 --> 02:58:48.080 align:start position:0%
promote the efficiency
 
02:58:51.750 --> 02:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:55.190 --> 02:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
so um a couple of highlights i wanted to
 
02:58:59.190 --> 02:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
make note of we currently have 54
 
02:59:02.230 --> 02:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
licensing boards that we administer as
 
02:59:04.389 --> 02:59:04.399 align:start position:0%
well as the prescription drug monitoring
 
02:59:04.399 --> 02:59:06.550 align:start position:0%
well as the prescription drug monitoring
program

02:59:06.550 --> 02:59:06.560 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:59:09.269 --> 02:59:09.279 align:start position:0%
at present we have a little over 300
 
02:59:10.469 --> 02:59:10.479 align:start position:0%
board members
 
02:59:12.550 --> 02:59:12.560 align:start position:0%
the majority of them receive some sort
 
02:59:13.990 --> 02:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
of per diem although it's not
 
02:59:15.429 --> 02:59:15.439 align:start position:0%
consistent something that we're trying
 
02:59:18.070 --> 02:59:18.080 align:start position:0%
to remedy through statutory change
 
02:59:19.750 --> 02:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
and some of them also receive mileage
 
02:59:21.510 --> 02:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
reimbursement beyond
 
02:59:24.150 --> 02:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
that they're essentially volunteers most
 
02:59:26.309 --> 02:59:26.319 align:start position:0%
of whom are appointed by gnc
 
02:59:29.110 --> 02:59:29.120 align:start position:0%
some are appointed directly by me and
 
02:59:29.910 --> 02:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
some others
 
02:59:33.349 --> 02:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
are nominated by various professional
 
02:59:33.359 --> 02:59:36.070 align:start position:0%
are nominated by various professional
associations

02:59:36.070 --> 02:59:36.080 align:start position:0%
associations
 
02:59:38.790 --> 02:59:38.800 align:start position:0%
so with the exception of the pdmp which
 
02:59:41.110 --> 02:59:41.120 align:start position:0%
is its own little silo as i'm sure you
 
02:59:41.120 --> 02:59:42.550 align:start position:0%
is its own little silo as i'm sure you
know

02:59:42.550 --> 02:59:42.560 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:59:45.110 --> 02:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
our staff at the office primarily
 
02:59:46.389 --> 02:59:46.399 align:start position:0%
assists the boards with
 
02:59:49.110 --> 02:59:49.120 align:start position:0%
two functions the first obviously is
 
02:59:50.710 --> 02:59:50.720 align:start position:0%
licensing individuals who wish to
 
02:59:52.469 --> 02:59:52.479 align:start position:0%
practice a particular profession in new
 
02:59:52.479 --> 02:59:53.349 align:start position:0%
practice a particular profession in new
hampshire

02:59:53.349 --> 02:59:53.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:59:55.110 --> 02:59:55.120 align:start position:0%
and the second is really enforcing
 
02:59:56.630 --> 02:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
compliance through laws and
 
02:59:58.630 --> 02:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
investigations so we've got licensing
 
03:00:00.469 --> 03:00:00.479 align:start position:0%
and we've got enforcement
 
03:00:04.469 --> 03:00:04.479 align:start position:0%
a couple of fun facts in fiscal year 20
 
03:00:07.830 --> 03:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
we had over 223 000
 
03:00:09.750 --> 03:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
occupational licenses in new hampshire
 
03:00:11.750 --> 03:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
that were active
 
03:00:13.750 --> 03:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
this was a substantial increase from the
 
03:00:16.870 --> 03:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
prior fiscal year of about 29 percent
 
03:00:19.990 --> 03:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
um it's really unclear at this point
 
03:00:22.710 --> 03:00:22.720 align:start position:0%
what caused such a such an increase in
 
03:00:25.030 --> 03:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
the number of licensees
 
03:00:27.830 --> 03:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
the board of nursing has bears the bulk
 
03:00:30.150 --> 03:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
of our licensees
 
03:00:32.630 --> 03:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
and it could be that we're seeing an
 
03:00:34.230 --> 03:00:34.240 align:start position:0%
increase of licensees through the board
 
03:00:36.309 --> 03:00:36.319 align:start position:0%
of nursing
 
03:00:39.910 --> 03:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 20 um we cataloged about
 
03:00:43.190 --> 03:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
1100 complaints i'm not actually
 
03:00:45.190 --> 03:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
um confident that that number is
 
03:00:46.790 --> 03:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
accurate and you'll and
 
03:00:50.070 --> 03:00:50.080 align:start position:0%
and as we talk a little bit further um
 
03:00:52.230 --> 03:00:52.240 align:start position:0%
about our reorganization i'll explain
 
03:00:54.830 --> 03:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
why but essentially we have since
 
03:00:54.840 --> 03:00:56.230 align:start position:0%
why but essentially we have since
consolidated

03:00:56.230 --> 03:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
consolidated
 
03:00:59.030 --> 03:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
um the investigations and complaint
 
03:00:59.040 --> 03:01:00.230 align:start position:0%
um the investigations and complaint
process

03:01:00.230 --> 03:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:01:02.790 --> 03:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
and realized that we were not um
 
03:01:04.150 --> 03:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
counting all of the
 
03:01:05.830 --> 03:01:05.840 align:start position:0%
complaints and not all the boards were
 
03:01:08.230 --> 03:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
keeping track of of the complaints as
 
03:01:09.349 --> 03:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
required so we
 
03:01:11.670 --> 03:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
really think that the the number that
 
03:01:13.830 --> 03:01:13.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to see in fiscal year 21 is
 
03:01:18.830 --> 03:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:18.840 --> 03:01:22.469 align:start position:0%
 
investigations

03:01:22.469 --> 03:01:22.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:25.269 --> 03:01:25.279 align:start position:0%
so in fiscal year 20 we had 67 permanent
 
03:01:26.790 --> 03:01:26.800 align:start position:0%
classified positions
 
03:01:30.230 --> 03:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
um we had reorganized we're working on
 
03:01:32.469 --> 03:01:32.479 align:start position:0%
reorganizing the agency so about 17
 
03:01:34.550 --> 03:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
full-time positions are dedicated to
 
03:01:36.389 --> 03:01:36.399 align:start position:0%
enforcement related tasks
 
03:01:38.230 --> 03:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
inspections and investigations
 
03:01:38.240 --> 03:01:39.510 align:start position:0%
inspections and investigations
prosecutors

03:01:39.510 --> 03:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
prosecutors
 
03:01:42.070 --> 03:01:42.080 align:start position:0%
um 39 full-time positions are dedicated
 
03:01:44.469 --> 03:01:44.479 align:start position:0%
to licensing and ministering boards
 
03:01:47.670 --> 03:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
um and about 20 of oplc's workforce part
 
03:01:47.680 --> 03:01:48.309 align:start position:0%
um and about 20 of oplc's workforce part
time

03:01:48.309 --> 03:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:01:50.150 --> 03:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
i can tell you from my observation that
 
03:01:52.150 --> 03:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
that in and of itself is a barrier to
 
03:01:53.990 --> 03:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
achieving efficiency in economy and that
 
03:01:55.510 --> 03:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
there has been
 
03:01:59.030 --> 03:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
a constant churn of personnel at oplc
 
03:02:01.590 --> 03:02:01.600 align:start position:0%
related to its part-time workforce
 
03:02:04.070 --> 03:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
people generally utilize the part-time
 
03:02:06.550 --> 03:02:06.560 align:start position:0%
positions to move into other full-time
 
03:02:08.150 --> 03:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
positions throughout the state
 
03:02:09.990 --> 03:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
we have seen a decrease in that
 
03:02:12.950 --> 03:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
obviously because of the hiring freeze
 
03:02:15.990 --> 03:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
so we've had some consistency there but
 
03:02:18.150 --> 03:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
that is something that we're seeking to
 
03:02:20.710 --> 03:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
hopefully resolve as we move forward
 
03:02:23.030 --> 03:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
we are a self-funded agency and and
 
03:02:24.790 --> 03:02:24.800 align:start position:0%
obviously our fees have to bear
 
03:02:26.790 --> 03:02:26.800 align:start position:0%
a relationship and approximate the
 
03:02:28.309 --> 03:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
expense of issuing the license of
 
03:02:30.790 --> 03:02:30.800 align:start position:0%
inspecting and regulating the businesses
 
03:02:33.830 --> 03:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
licensed we've had some
 
03:02:35.910 --> 03:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
different approaches with our fees i
 
03:02:37.429 --> 03:02:37.439 align:start position:0%
think initially we're general funded
 
03:02:37.439 --> 03:02:37.910 align:start position:0%
think initially we're general funded
although

03:02:37.910 --> 03:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
although
 
03:02:41.110 --> 03:02:41.120 align:start position:0%
that that predates me and then we moved
 
03:02:42.710 --> 03:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
to a dedicated fund
 
03:02:45.830 --> 03:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
that was non-lapsing um and then
 
03:02:47.830 --> 03:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
now we have a dedicated fund that lastes
 
03:02:49.830 --> 03:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
at the end of every fiscal year
 
03:02:52.389 --> 03:02:52.399 align:start position:0%
um which from my perspective you know
 
03:02:53.830 --> 03:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
can can be
 
03:02:55.750 --> 03:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
problematic in trying to meet the the
 
03:02:58.630 --> 03:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
needs of the agency
 
03:03:01.510 --> 03:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
because we administer over 54 licensing
 
03:03:03.750 --> 03:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
boards each with their own professional
 
03:03:07.030 --> 03:03:07.040 align:start position:0%
um regulatory authority we obviously
 
03:03:08.150 --> 03:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
engage in a lot of
 
03:03:11.750 --> 03:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
rule making and in 2018 we comprise 20
 
03:03:13.349 --> 03:03:13.359 align:start position:0%
of the state's rulemaking proposals
 
03:03:15.349 --> 03:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
which is quite significant in an agency
 
03:03:16.070 --> 03:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
of our size
 
03:03:19.269 --> 03:03:19.279 align:start position:0%
relatively small about 86 staffers
 
03:03:22.710 --> 03:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
um to to accomplish 20 percent of the
 
03:03:25.990 --> 03:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
state's rulemaking proposals
 
03:03:29.510 --> 03:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
so we really are right now engaged
 
03:03:32.150 --> 03:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
in a process to really rethink uh the
 
03:03:33.830 --> 03:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
purpose of the agency the mission of the
 
03:03:36.150 --> 03:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
agency and the vision of the agency
 
03:03:38.550 --> 03:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
um i think many of you can recall when
 
03:03:39.990 --> 03:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
oplc was formed
 
03:03:42.750 --> 03:03:42.760 align:start position:0%
it's been quite a rocky start since
 
03:03:42.760 --> 03:03:44.389 align:start position:0%
it's been quite a rocky start since
2015.

03:03:44.389 --> 03:03:44.399 align:start position:0%
2015.
 
03:03:47.670 --> 03:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
and um the agency itself
 
03:03:49.910 --> 03:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
really never came into its own it really
 
03:03:51.110 --> 03:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
in my opinion
 
03:03:54.469 --> 03:03:54.479 align:start position:0%
took on um a lot of the you know the
 
03:03:54.479 --> 03:03:55.590 align:start position:0%
took on um a lot of the you know the
board's

03:03:55.590 --> 03:03:55.600 align:start position:0%
board's
 
03:03:57.750 --> 03:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
mission which i think is distinct from
 
03:03:59.670 --> 03:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
the agency mission so we're currently
 
03:04:01.349 --> 03:04:01.359 align:start position:0%
undergoing a review of our mission and
 
03:04:02.870 --> 03:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
our visions
 
03:04:04.790 --> 03:04:04.800 align:start position:0%
but i think at a minimum occupational
 
03:04:06.550 --> 03:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
licensing has to protect the public
 
03:04:06.560 --> 03:04:07.910 align:start position:0%
licensing has to protect the public
obviously

03:04:07.910 --> 03:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
03:04:09.670 --> 03:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
by ensuring that individuals meet
 
03:04:11.990 --> 03:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
minimum standards necessary to practice
 
03:04:13.429 --> 03:04:13.439 align:start position:0%
in a safe manner
 
03:04:15.750 --> 03:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
at the same time we need to make sure
 
03:04:16.630 --> 03:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
that those
 
03:04:19.590 --> 03:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
standards those regulations are not so
 
03:04:19.600 --> 03:04:20.870 align:start position:0%
standards those regulations are not so
um

03:04:20.870 --> 03:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:23.990 --> 03:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
out of touch that they they
 
03:04:26.550 --> 03:04:26.560 align:start position:0%
they represent um an unnecessary barrier
 
03:04:28.790 --> 03:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
to workforce entry so licensing in of
 
03:04:28.800 --> 03:04:29.269 align:start position:0%
to workforce entry so licensing in of
itself

03:04:29.269 --> 03:04:29.279 align:start position:0%
itself
 
03:04:31.590 --> 03:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
has to be a barrier to workforce entry
 
03:04:33.269 --> 03:04:33.279 align:start position:0%
um but we don't want to create
 
03:04:35.510 --> 03:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
unnecessary barriers and i think that's
 
03:04:37.349 --> 03:04:37.359 align:start position:0%
one purpose of the agency that's
 
03:04:38.389 --> 03:04:38.399 align:start position:0%
distinct from
 
03:04:41.750 --> 03:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
from licensing boards so let's uh
 
03:04:44.469 --> 03:04:44.479 align:start position:0%
i didn't create this but i i like it
 
03:04:44.479 --> 03:04:44.870 align:start position:0%
i didn't create this but i i like it
it's

03:04:44.870 --> 03:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:04:47.190 --> 03:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
it's a nice visual of how we all come
 
03:04:47.200 --> 03:04:48.870 align:start position:0%
it's a nice visual of how we all come
together

03:04:48.870 --> 03:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
together
 
03:04:52.230 --> 03:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
so when oplc was first created
 
03:04:55.590 --> 03:04:55.600 align:start position:0%
this was the basic org chart in that in
 
03:04:56.870 --> 03:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
rsa 310a
 
03:04:58.790 --> 03:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
we have two divisions we have a division
 
03:05:00.309 --> 03:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
of health professions a division of
 
03:05:01.990 --> 03:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
technical professions
 
03:05:03.590 --> 03:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
we technically don't have a division of
 
03:05:03.600 --> 03:05:05.030 align:start position:0%
we technically don't have a division of
administration

03:05:05.030 --> 03:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
administration
 
03:05:07.429 --> 03:05:07.439 align:start position:0%
um but administration is overseen by the
 
03:05:09.910 --> 03:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
oplc executive director
 
03:05:13.429 --> 03:05:13.439 align:start position:0%
and when oplc was hold on
 
03:05:16.710 --> 03:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
first formed so we had
 
03:05:19.590 --> 03:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
um 20 boards within the division of
 
03:05:21.110 --> 03:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
technical professions you'll see them
 
03:05:22.550 --> 03:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
noted here
 
03:05:25.269 --> 03:05:25.279 align:start position:0%
and the staff really mirrored what it
 
03:05:26.950 --> 03:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
looked like with the joint boards and
 
03:05:28.230 --> 03:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
this existed
 
03:05:32.309 --> 03:05:32.319 align:start position:0%
you'll see until july of 2020 um
 
03:05:34.309 --> 03:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
there really had been no major changes
 
03:05:36.230 --> 03:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
to to the staff that were supporting the
 
03:05:37.910 --> 03:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
licensing boards
 
03:05:39.590 --> 03:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
um the division of health professions
 
03:05:41.830 --> 03:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
boards obviously mainly health
 
03:05:43.349 --> 03:05:43.359 align:start position:0%
professions we've
 
03:05:45.349 --> 03:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
added a few throughout the years most
 
03:05:47.590 --> 03:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
recently veterinary medicine
 
03:05:51.030 --> 03:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
um and you'll see that the staff
 
03:05:54.309 --> 03:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
um again through july 2020
 
03:05:57.269 --> 03:05:57.279 align:start position:0%
really just mirrored what the boards had
 
03:05:58.870 --> 03:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
for existing staff when they came over
 
03:05:59.910 --> 03:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
to oplc
 
03:06:03.349 --> 03:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
in 2015 so if i um
 
03:06:05.750 --> 03:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
kind of scroll in you know this was
 
03:06:05.760 --> 03:06:07.110 align:start position:0%
kind of scroll in you know this was
pharmacy

03:06:07.110 --> 03:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
pharmacy
 
03:06:10.469 --> 03:06:10.479 align:start position:0%
um then we had nursing cosmetology
 
03:06:12.790 --> 03:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
there really had been no integration
 
03:06:14.309 --> 03:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
that one would expect
 
03:06:18.309 --> 03:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
for for agency and what our purposes
 
03:06:21.349 --> 03:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
so um really
 
03:06:23.429 --> 03:06:23.439 align:start position:0%
in this past year we've engaged in an
 
03:06:23.439 --> 03:06:24.389 align:start position:0%
in this past year we've engaged in an
initiative

03:06:24.389 --> 03:06:24.399 align:start position:0%
initiative
 
03:06:27.910 --> 03:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
to achieve our statutory mission through
 
03:06:28.950 --> 03:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
agents um
 
03:06:31.990 --> 03:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
to achieve our statutory mission of
 
03:06:33.910 --> 03:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
achieving efficiencies through agency
 
03:06:33.920 --> 03:06:35.590 align:start position:0%
achieving efficiencies through agency
reorganization

03:06:35.590 --> 03:06:35.600 align:start position:0%
reorganization
 
03:06:38.309 --> 03:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
um so you can see in fy 2021 we had the
 
03:06:39.750 --> 03:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
division of health professions and
 
03:06:42.150 --> 03:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
division of technical professions and
 
03:06:42.160 --> 03:06:42.710 align:start position:0%
division of technical professions and
each

03:06:42.710 --> 03:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
each
 
03:06:45.110 --> 03:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
um board and the staff that supported
 
03:06:47.670 --> 03:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
those boards had their own process
 
03:06:50.630 --> 03:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
for doing pretty much everything that
 
03:06:51.510 --> 03:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
our agency
 
03:06:54.870 --> 03:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
was was accomplishing so we had between
 
03:06:56.870 --> 03:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
all of the boards 54 different ways of
 
03:06:58.150 --> 03:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
taking in mail
 
03:07:00.070 --> 03:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
54 different ways of approaching
 
03:07:01.510 --> 03:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
customer service
 
03:07:04.550 --> 03:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
54 different licensing processes and 54
 
03:07:06.710 --> 03:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
different investigation processes
 
03:07:08.630 --> 03:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
this obviously is not efficient and was
 
03:07:10.230 --> 03:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
not the intended purpose
 
03:07:13.510 --> 03:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
of the agency um and so
 
03:07:15.910 --> 03:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
what we have been doing over the last uh
 
03:07:17.190 --> 03:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
six to eight months
 
03:07:20.230 --> 03:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
is going through an agency restructuring
 
03:07:22.150 --> 03:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
and we are requesting some statutory
 
03:07:24.550 --> 03:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
changes to make this complete
 
03:07:27.590 --> 03:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
um to really align agency in accordance
 
03:07:27.600 --> 03:07:29.030 align:start position:0%
um to really align agency in accordance
with

03:07:29.030 --> 03:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:07:32.150 --> 03:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
job function and not subject matter from
 
03:07:34.309 --> 03:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
my perspective our staff accomplished
 
03:07:35.830 --> 03:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
two primary functions licensing and
 
03:07:37.750 --> 03:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement and so we should really be
 
03:07:39.590 --> 03:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
focusing on processes
 
03:07:41.190 --> 03:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
and not subject matter so we'd like to
 
03:07:42.870 --> 03:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
create the division of licensing and
 
03:07:44.630 --> 03:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
board administration
 
03:07:47.269 --> 03:07:47.279 align:start position:0%
and the division of enforcement and
 
03:07:47.279 --> 03:07:48.230 align:start position:0%
and the division of enforcement and
really

03:07:48.230 --> 03:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
really
 
03:07:50.469 --> 03:07:50.479 align:start position:0%
get down to one male process that's
 
03:07:52.309 --> 03:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
already been accomplished one customer
 
03:07:53.269 --> 03:07:53.279 align:start position:0%
service approach
 
03:07:55.269 --> 03:07:55.279 align:start position:0%
that's part of our next phase one
 
03:07:57.349 --> 03:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
licensing process and one investigation
 
03:07:57.359 --> 03:07:58.630 align:start position:0%
licensing process and one investigation
process

03:07:58.630 --> 03:07:58.640 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:08:01.269 --> 03:08:01.279 align:start position:0%
um where we're at with that right now is
 
03:08:02.550 --> 03:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
that we have created
 
03:08:05.349 --> 03:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
a division of enforcement or without the
 
03:08:07.510 --> 03:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
actual statutory change of the division
 
03:08:09.510 --> 03:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
but we've we've put the people together
 
03:08:10.870 --> 03:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
and they are functioning
 
03:08:14.469 --> 03:08:14.479 align:start position:0%
as one unit um we have put together
 
03:08:17.429 --> 03:08:17.439 align:start position:0%
one um specific mail process and we're
 
03:08:19.269 --> 03:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
moving on next to a customer service
 
03:08:19.279 --> 03:08:21.590 align:start position:0%
moving on next to a customer service
unit

03:08:21.590 --> 03:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
unit
 
03:08:24.950 --> 03:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
so um i spoke a little bit obviously
 
03:08:27.269 --> 03:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
about our agency reorganization project
 
03:08:28.150 --> 03:08:28.160 align:start position:0%
but i think the
 
03:08:29.670 --> 03:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
other thing is we need to leverage
 
03:08:31.269 --> 03:08:31.279 align:start position:0%
technology in order to achieve
 
03:08:31.279 --> 03:08:32.150 align:start position:0%
technology in order to achieve
efficiency

03:08:32.150 --> 03:08:32.160 align:start position:0%
efficiency
 
03:08:35.349 --> 03:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
so um we've embarked on an online
 
03:08:36.790 --> 03:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
licensing initiative
 
03:08:39.670 --> 03:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
um many of our boards have some version
 
03:08:41.670 --> 03:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
of online licensing through our my
 
03:08:43.670 --> 03:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
licensing online portal
 
03:08:46.550 --> 03:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
um not all are online and not all
 
03:08:48.309 --> 03:08:48.319 align:start position:0%
require online
 
03:08:51.269 --> 03:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
renewals in particular and i this really
 
03:08:52.630 --> 03:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
um is inefficient
 
03:08:54.469 --> 03:08:54.479 align:start position:0%
and increases the amount of time that it
 
03:08:55.990 --> 03:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
takes to get somebody licensed
 
03:08:57.750 --> 03:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
which then results in a barrier to
 
03:08:59.429 --> 03:08:59.439 align:start position:0%
workforce entry because
 
03:09:01.670 --> 03:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day what i'm seeing
 
03:09:03.349 --> 03:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
across the state is that we're really
 
03:09:05.429 --> 03:09:05.439 align:start position:0%
competing with other states particularly
 
03:09:05.439 --> 03:09:06.469 align:start position:0%
competing with other states particularly
vermont

03:09:06.469 --> 03:09:06.479 align:start position:0%
vermont
 
03:09:09.110 --> 03:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
um really vermont they're very they're
 
03:09:11.110 --> 03:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
very fast and processing licenses so if
 
03:09:12.070 --> 03:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
somebody comes in
 
03:09:14.389 --> 03:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
and they're looking for um they may be
 
03:09:15.910 --> 03:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
on the border and they're looking for a
 
03:09:17.590 --> 03:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
job if it takes new hampshire
 
03:09:19.830 --> 03:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
you know six weeks to accomplish what it
 
03:09:20.710 --> 03:09:20.720 align:start position:0%
takes vermont
 
03:09:22.950 --> 03:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
24 hours to do then obviously we're not
 
03:09:24.389 --> 03:09:24.399 align:start position:0%
we're not going to
 
03:09:27.349 --> 03:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
obtain that licensed professional um to
 
03:09:28.870 --> 03:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
provide workforce for us
 
03:09:31.269 --> 03:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
so in any event we need to move from my
 
03:09:31.279 --> 03:09:32.070 align:start position:0%
so in any event we need to move from my
perspective

03:09:32.070 --> 03:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
03:09:35.349 --> 03:09:35.359 align:start position:0%
on to electronic licensing and so
 
03:09:37.590 --> 03:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
we've started on an initiative all of
 
03:09:39.750 --> 03:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
our renewals will be up
 
03:09:42.790 --> 03:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
online by march 15th
 
03:09:44.790 --> 03:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
and then we will slowly work toward
 
03:09:46.389 --> 03:09:46.399 align:start position:0%
getting all initial licensing
 
03:09:48.150 --> 03:09:48.160 align:start position:0%
applications online
 
03:09:51.030 --> 03:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
we also need to improve communications
 
03:09:51.040 --> 03:09:51.830 align:start position:0%
we also need to improve communications
um

03:09:51.830 --> 03:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:54.790 --> 03:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
and our website has historically not
 
03:09:55.590 --> 03:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
been great
 
03:09:57.830 --> 03:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
at all um it's been very difficult i
 
03:09:59.590 --> 03:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
think for the end user to really
 
03:10:03.190 --> 03:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
um understand uh basically what it takes
 
03:10:05.349 --> 03:10:05.359 align:start position:0%
to obtain a license and also to file a
 
03:10:07.110 --> 03:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
complaint so we
 
03:10:09.750 --> 03:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
um are we completely redesigned our
 
03:10:10.790 --> 03:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
website and i
 
03:10:13.750 --> 03:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
just prior to this meeting saw saw a
 
03:10:15.429 --> 03:10:15.439 align:start position:0%
draft and it should be launched by
 
03:10:15.439 --> 03:10:16.309 align:start position:0%
draft and it should be launched by
february

03:10:16.309 --> 03:10:16.319 align:start position:0%
february
 
03:10:19.349 --> 03:10:19.359 align:start position:0%
1st of 2021 it's a complete redesign
 
03:10:19.359 --> 03:10:20.070 align:start position:0%
1st of 2021 it's a complete redesign
focusing

03:10:20.070 --> 03:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
focusing
 
03:10:23.590 --> 03:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
on improved communication to licensees
 
03:10:25.110 --> 03:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
and then also document management
 
03:10:27.190 --> 03:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
scanning all documentation
 
03:10:28.870 --> 03:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
to reduce error rates and making sure
 
03:10:30.710 --> 03:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
that we're leveraging technology that
 
03:10:30.720 --> 03:10:33.590 align:start position:0%
that we're leveraging technology that
way

03:10:33.590 --> 03:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:35.910 --> 03:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
we are also working on achieving
 
03:10:37.670 --> 03:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
efficiency in accounting
 
03:10:40.630 --> 03:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
we are moving to eliminate our double
 
03:10:42.070 --> 03:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
accounting method
 
03:10:44.229 --> 03:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
um which which you may see when it comes
 
03:10:46.550 --> 03:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
up um during the budget bill but
 
03:10:49.830 --> 03:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh essentially this this uh was
 
03:10:52.550 --> 03:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
this was not transparent in my opinion
 
03:10:52.560 --> 03:10:52.950 align:start position:0%
this was not transparent in my opinion
um

03:10:52.950 --> 03:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:55.510 --> 03:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
it required some explanation as to what
 
03:10:56.630 --> 03:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
was actually going on with their
 
03:10:58.630 --> 03:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
finances and so to increase public
 
03:10:58.640 --> 03:10:59.830 align:start position:0%
finances and so to increase public
transparency

03:10:59.830 --> 03:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
transparency
 
03:11:01.269 --> 03:11:01.279 align:start position:0%
we want to eliminate the double
 
03:11:03.110 --> 03:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
accounting method um
 
03:11:04.550 --> 03:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
the other thing that we're looking at is
 
03:11:06.469 --> 03:11:06.479 align:start position:0%
you know when oplc was first formed we
 
03:11:08.150 --> 03:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
were tracking everything down we had
 
03:11:08.160 --> 03:11:08.870 align:start position:0%
were tracking everything down we had
different

03:11:08.870 --> 03:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
different
 
03:11:10.630 --> 03:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
activity codes for all the boards that's
 
03:11:12.229 --> 03:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
incredibly inefficient
 
03:11:14.070 --> 03:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
so we needed to start functioning as an
 
03:11:15.830 --> 03:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
agency as opposed to
 
03:11:18.469 --> 03:11:18.479 align:start position:0%
um 54 different boards and so we're
 
03:11:19.429 --> 03:11:19.439 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
03:11:21.990 --> 03:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
possibly eliminating the activity codes
 
03:11:23.429 --> 03:11:23.439 align:start position:0%
obviously we'd still be able to track
 
03:11:26.550 --> 03:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
expenses and revenue to the board level
 
03:11:28.550 --> 03:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
but just the actual process of having
 
03:11:30.309 --> 03:11:30.319 align:start position:0%
everything broken up by activity codes i
 
03:11:33.190 --> 03:11:33.200 align:start position:0%
think will assist
 
03:11:34.710 --> 03:11:34.720 align:start position:0%
and then finally we're looking at
 
03:11:36.950 --> 03:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
achieving efficiency and personnel
 
03:11:39.110 --> 03:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
um one of the things we're looking at as
 
03:11:40.950 --> 03:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
i said earlier
 
03:11:43.510 --> 03:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
20 of our workforce is part time this is
 
03:11:45.269 --> 03:11:45.279 align:start position:0%
this is a problem this is a barrier to
 
03:11:47.110 --> 03:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
achieving efficiency
 
03:11:49.030 --> 03:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
and so as we move forward we'd really
 
03:11:50.469 --> 03:11:50.479 align:start position:0%
like to utilize some
 
03:11:52.070 --> 03:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
funding that has been historically a
 
03:11:53.590 --> 03:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
class 50 funding
 
03:11:56.229 --> 03:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
um to create full-time positions and
 
03:11:57.510 --> 03:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
hopefully that will provide us the
 
03:12:01.190 --> 03:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
consistency we need in workforce
 
03:12:03.750 --> 03:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
um spoke a little bit about leveraging
 
03:12:05.590 --> 03:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
technology some of the things some of
 
03:12:07.349 --> 03:12:07.359 align:start position:0%
the projects that we're looking into
 
03:12:09.349 --> 03:12:09.359 align:start position:0%
include investigations and inspection
 
03:12:09.359 --> 03:12:10.630 align:start position:0%
include investigations and inspection
software

03:12:10.630 --> 03:12:10.640 align:start position:0%
software
 
03:12:12.870 --> 03:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
when i first i came on board about a
 
03:12:14.469 --> 03:12:14.479 align:start position:0%
year ago
 
03:12:17.590 --> 03:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
we had one
 
03:12:19.990 --> 03:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
person functioning in a prosecutor role
 
03:12:21.429 --> 03:12:21.439 align:start position:0%
outside of the apu
 
03:12:23.750 --> 03:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
and he he is an attorney but he wasn't
 
03:12:25.510 --> 03:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
in an attorney position
 
03:12:27.830 --> 03:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
um so we've completely created an
 
03:12:27.840 --> 03:12:28.550 align:start position:0%
um so we've completely created an
in-house

03:12:28.550 --> 03:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
in-house
 
03:12:30.870 --> 03:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
prosecutions unit and investigations
 
03:12:32.630 --> 03:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
unit that's really going to decrease the
 
03:12:34.070 --> 03:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
amount of time
 
03:12:37.349 --> 03:12:37.359 align:start position:0%
to get a case process through our agency
 
03:12:39.990 --> 03:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
um when i came on board cases were
 
03:12:41.030 --> 03:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
lagging for
 
03:12:43.510 --> 03:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
years which is really unacceptable so
 
03:12:44.950 --> 03:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
i've given
 
03:12:46.550 --> 03:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
my staff the directive that we need to
 
03:12:48.550 --> 03:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
reduce that to
 
03:12:50.630 --> 03:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
complaint to adjudication in eight
 
03:12:51.750 --> 03:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
months or less
 
03:12:53.750 --> 03:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
and i think it's going to help um by
 
03:12:55.910 --> 03:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
leveraging technology so we're we'd like
 
03:12:57.910 --> 03:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
to focus on
 
03:13:01.429 --> 03:13:01.439 align:start position:0%
moving to electronic operations that way
 
03:13:04.229 --> 03:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
the other thing that we're working on is
 
03:13:07.830 --> 03:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
obviously our fees so there's been some
 
03:13:10.389 --> 03:13:10.399 align:start position:0%
um there's been some back and forth i
 
03:13:12.150 --> 03:13:12.160 align:start position:0%
think regarding fees in terms of what
 
03:13:12.160 --> 03:13:12.950 align:start position:0%
think regarding fees in terms of what
are

03:13:12.950 --> 03:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:13:15.750 --> 03:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
what our statutory authority is and um
 
03:13:17.670 --> 03:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
what the board statutory authority is so
 
03:13:19.670 --> 03:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
historically as you may recall
 
03:13:21.750 --> 03:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
all the boards set their fees a number
 
03:13:23.510 --> 03:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
of our boards have fees set in
 
03:13:26.150 --> 03:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
statute um the majority of other fees
 
03:13:27.349 --> 03:13:27.359 align:start position:0%
are set in rule
 
03:13:31.670 --> 03:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
then in 2018 rsa 310a was amended to
 
03:13:35.590 --> 03:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
give oplc the authority to set the fees
 
03:13:38.229 --> 03:13:38.239 align:start position:0%
but the board still retained those fees
 
03:13:38.239 --> 03:13:38.870 align:start position:0%
but the board still retained those fees
um

03:13:38.870 --> 03:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:40.870 --> 03:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
or that authority in their practice act
 
03:13:42.389 --> 03:13:42.399 align:start position:0%
so um
 
03:13:44.950 --> 03:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
our position in consulting with doj is
 
03:13:46.070 --> 03:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
that we
 
03:13:47.750 --> 03:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
did not necessarily have the authority
 
03:13:50.550 --> 03:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
to set fees for all the boards
 
03:13:53.030 --> 03:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
um and so we are seeking some statutory
 
03:13:54.710 --> 03:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
changes on that
 
03:13:57.349 --> 03:13:57.359 align:start position:0%
and i'm assuming that at some point will
 
03:13:57.359 --> 03:13:58.229 align:start position:0%
and i'm assuming that at some point will
come

03:13:58.229 --> 03:13:58.239 align:start position:0%
come
 
03:14:01.349 --> 03:14:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:04.070 --> 03:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
but um essentially we're projecting
 
03:14:04.080 --> 03:14:04.950 align:start position:0%
but um essentially we're projecting
revenue

03:14:04.950 --> 03:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
03:14:08.150 --> 03:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
um fy 22 and 23 you'll see it reflected
 
03:14:08.160 --> 03:14:08.950 align:start position:0%
um fy 22 and 23 you'll see it reflected
there

03:14:08.950 --> 03:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:14:11.910 --> 03:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
we are anticipated to lapse a certain
 
03:14:12.870 --> 03:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
amount of funding
 
03:14:21.670 --> 03:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:25.190 --> 03:14:25.200 align:start position:0%
and you'll see with our you'll see
 
03:14:26.870 --> 03:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
you know you'll see the confusion
 
03:14:28.870 --> 03:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
because the agency was previously
 
03:14:30.790 --> 03:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
self-billing itself so
 
03:14:32.229 --> 03:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
the numbers appear to be a little
 
03:14:34.550 --> 03:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
inflated in terms of our revenue for fy
 
03:14:36.870 --> 03:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
2020 15.1
 
03:14:39.349 --> 03:14:39.359 align:start position:0%
and then obviously what what um we're
 
03:14:39.359 --> 03:14:40.469 align:start position:0%
and then obviously what what um we're
anticipating

03:14:40.469 --> 03:14:40.479 align:start position:0%
anticipating
 
03:14:43.190 --> 03:14:43.200 align:start position:0%
for fy 22 and 23. so by eliminating the
 
03:14:45.590 --> 03:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
double accounting it makes clear that
 
03:14:48.469 --> 03:14:48.479 align:start position:0%
um that you know what our revenue and
 
03:14:50.830 --> 03:14:50.840 align:start position:0%
expenses actually
 
03:14:52.710 --> 03:14:52.720 align:start position:0%
are and so
 
03:14:55.830 --> 03:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
then in terms of priorities we are
 
03:14:57.349 --> 03:14:57.359 align:start position:0%
um first thing is you know we're
 
03:14:58.950 --> 03:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
undergoing a performance audit
 
03:15:00.790 --> 03:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
that um i actually had the entrance
 
03:15:02.229 --> 03:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
meeting today
 
03:15:05.830 --> 03:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
um we are completing our move projects
 
03:15:08.309 --> 03:15:08.319 align:start position:0%
um some of you may know but that we were
 
03:15:11.110 --> 03:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh asked to move from our philbrick uh
 
03:15:13.070 --> 03:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
building location we did that quite
 
03:15:15.830 --> 03:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
expeditiously in about 30 days
 
03:15:17.990 --> 03:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
over july during covid and during our
 
03:15:20.229 --> 03:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
restructuring so um
 
03:15:21.349 --> 03:15:21.359 align:start position:0%
it was a little it was a little
 
03:15:23.750 --> 03:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
difficult it was fun um but we are now
 
03:15:25.750 --> 03:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
relocating at seven eagles square
 
03:15:27.269 --> 03:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
and so we have a couple of projects that
 
03:15:28.870 --> 03:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
we need to complete in order to
 
03:15:31.190 --> 03:15:31.200 align:start position:0%
to make that happen um we're working on
 
03:15:32.710 --> 03:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
creating and implementing standardized
 
03:15:33.990 --> 03:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
procedures so as i
 
03:15:35.830 --> 03:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
previously mentioned the agency really
 
03:15:37.590 --> 03:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
hadn't done much
 
03:15:40.469 --> 03:15:40.479 align:start position:0%
by way of standardizing procedures so
 
03:15:41.910 --> 03:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
the agency really is starting to
 
03:15:43.590 --> 03:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
exercise its authority to
 
03:15:47.429 --> 03:15:47.439 align:start position:0%
um to do the adjusting licensing fees
 
03:15:50.469 --> 03:15:50.479 align:start position:0%
fees have to be adjusted um
 
03:15:52.630 --> 03:15:52.640 align:start position:0%
some of the boards are at you know 250
 
03:15:54.469 --> 03:15:54.479 align:start position:0%
percent some are at nine percent
 
03:15:55.830 --> 03:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
you know so we really need to adjust
 
03:15:57.670 --> 03:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
those fees but i think we we
 
03:15:59.269 --> 03:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
certainly need a statutory change in
 
03:16:00.790 --> 03:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
order to do that
 
03:16:02.950 --> 03:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
um we would like to redefine our mission
 
03:16:03.830 --> 03:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
and vision again
 
03:16:05.590 --> 03:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
i don't i i don't think it's just
 
03:16:07.190 --> 03:16:07.200 align:start position:0%
protecting the public
 
03:16:08.710 --> 03:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
protecting the public is obviously the
 
03:16:09.990 --> 03:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
board's mission and we have to
 
03:16:11.670 --> 03:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
administer and facilitate that but we
 
03:16:13.110 --> 03:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
need to do that in an efficient and
 
03:16:14.469 --> 03:16:14.479 align:start position:0%
economic way
 
03:16:17.750 --> 03:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
um which has impact on workforce
 
03:16:19.349 --> 03:16:19.359 align:start position:0%
again we'd like to move all licensing
 
03:16:21.110 --> 03:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
online eliminating paper
 
03:16:23.429 --> 03:16:23.439 align:start position:0%
um completing our agency restructuring
 
03:16:25.830 --> 03:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping that to be completed within
 
03:16:27.510 --> 03:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
the next six months i had a meeting with
 
03:16:27.520 --> 03:16:28.070 align:start position:0%
the next six months i had a meeting with
dop

03:16:28.070 --> 03:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
dop
 
03:16:31.750 --> 03:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
today about that and we're hoping to
 
03:16:34.150 --> 03:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
complete that over the next six months
 
03:16:36.150 --> 03:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
and then finally you know the agency is
 
03:16:38.550 --> 03:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
really interested in looking at all the
 
03:16:40.870 --> 03:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
requirements uh for licensure
 
03:16:42.469 --> 03:16:42.479 align:start position:0%
and eliminating those requirements that
 
03:16:43.990 --> 03:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
are not absolutely necessary to ensure
 
03:16:45.830 --> 03:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
minimum standards are satisfied
 
03:16:47.190 --> 03:16:47.200 align:start position:0%
we're doing this with the boards of
 
03:16:49.429 --> 03:16:49.439 align:start position:0%
course um but one of the prime examples
 
03:16:50.790 --> 03:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
that i'll give you is a photograph i
 
03:16:52.870 --> 03:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
don't know why we require a photograph
 
03:16:55.349 --> 03:16:55.359 align:start position:0%
um seems like there's some room for for
 
03:16:57.429 --> 03:16:57.439 align:start position:0%
bias there
 
03:16:59.750 --> 03:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
and that's just a prime example but
 
03:17:01.670 --> 03:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
there are others for sure and so as we
 
03:17:03.510 --> 03:17:03.520 align:start position:0%
get deeper into
 
03:17:05.190 --> 03:17:05.200 align:start position:0%
our licensing projects we are going to
 
03:17:06.870 --> 03:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
be taking a look at that
 
03:17:10.229 --> 03:17:10.239 align:start position:0%
um finally what i didn't mention was our
 
03:17:13.830 --> 03:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
prescription drug monitoring program
 
03:17:15.830 --> 03:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
this obviously as you know is a separate
 
03:17:17.750 --> 03:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
it's a separate program that
 
03:17:20.070 --> 03:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
is a it's a tool for providers and
 
03:17:22.550 --> 03:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
dispensers to utilize to determine
 
03:17:24.469 --> 03:17:24.479 align:start position:0%
um when they're dispensing or
 
03:17:26.229 --> 03:17:26.239 align:start position:0%
prescribing controlled medications to
 
03:17:26.239 --> 03:17:27.110 align:start position:0%
prescribing controlled medications to
assess

03:17:27.110 --> 03:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
assess
 
03:17:28.469 --> 03:17:28.479 align:start position:0%
whether or not that prescription is
 
03:17:30.550 --> 03:17:30.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate there has been a lot of
 
03:17:32.710 --> 03:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
conversation at the state level as you
 
03:17:33.590 --> 03:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
probably know
 
03:17:35.910 --> 03:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
about what the overall purpose of the
 
03:17:35.920 --> 03:17:36.630 align:start position:0%
about what the overall purpose of the
pdmp

03:17:36.630 --> 03:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
pdmp
 
03:17:38.630 --> 03:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
is it was originally i think intended to
 
03:17:40.630 --> 03:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
be a provider tool
 
03:17:42.389 --> 03:17:42.399 align:start position:0%
but as we've moved forward i think
 
03:17:42.399 --> 03:17:44.870 align:start position:0%
but as we've moved forward i think
there's

03:17:44.870 --> 03:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:46.870 --> 03:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
there's a desire obviously to access the
 
03:17:46.880 --> 03:17:48.469 align:start position:0%
there's a desire obviously to access the
data

03:17:48.469 --> 03:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
data
 
03:17:50.150 --> 03:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
for public health purposes and so
 
03:17:51.830 --> 03:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
there's a conversation taking place
 
03:17:51.840 --> 03:17:52.710 align:start position:0%
there's a conversation taking place
regarding

03:17:52.710 --> 03:17:52.720 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
03:17:55.910 --> 03:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
what pdmp's role if any
 
03:17:59.429 --> 03:17:59.439 align:start position:0%
is in public health i think the state
 
03:18:01.190 --> 03:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
probably needs to make a decision on
 
03:18:02.309 --> 03:18:02.319 align:start position:0%
that i think if it
 
03:18:04.309 --> 03:18:04.319 align:start position:0%
i think if pdmp is viewed as a public
 
03:18:05.750 --> 03:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
health tool
 
03:18:09.030 --> 03:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
pdp probably does not belong at oplc
 
03:18:11.349 --> 03:18:11.359 align:start position:0%
to be frankly um to speak frankly i mean
 
03:18:12.950 --> 03:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
we deal with licensing if it is a
 
03:18:13.990 --> 03:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
provider tool then
 
03:18:17.429 --> 03:18:17.439 align:start position:0%
then it is appropriately um
 
03:18:20.830 --> 03:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
housed at uh oplc so i think some
 
03:18:20.840 --> 03:18:22.710 align:start position:0%
housed at uh oplc so i think some
conversations

03:18:22.710 --> 03:18:22.720 align:start position:0%
conversations
 
03:18:24.150 --> 03:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
you know need to be had regarding the
 
03:18:26.550 --> 03:18:26.560 align:start position:0%
purpose of the pdmp
 
03:18:28.710 --> 03:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
and that's that's it i apologize i kind
 
03:18:30.229 --> 03:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
of went through that quickly and threw a
 
03:18:31.990 --> 03:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
lot of information at you but i'm happy
 
03:18:33.590 --> 03:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions about
 
03:18:35.349 --> 03:18:35.359 align:start position:0%
what our agency does what we're working
 
03:18:37.030 --> 03:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
on what our goals are
 
03:18:38.309 --> 03:18:38.319 align:start position:0%
um if there's anything else i can
 
03:18:41.670 --> 03:18:41.680 align:start position:0%
provide please please don't hesitate
 
03:18:43.750 --> 03:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
and i'll just interject quickly that i
 
03:18:45.910 --> 03:18:45.920 align:start position:0%

03:18:47.920 --> 03:18:48.469 align:start position:0%
of you at about 11 o'clock this morning
using

03:18:48.469 --> 03:18:48.479 align:start position:0%
using
 
03:18:51.269 --> 03:18:51.279 align:start position:0%
along with the retirement systems um
 
03:18:51.279 --> 03:18:52.790 align:start position:0%
along with the retirement systems um
presentation

03:18:52.790 --> 03:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
03:18:56.630 --> 03:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
and the subcommittee list so i i use the
 
03:18:59.990 --> 03:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
you know the house edna
 
03:19:02.469 --> 03:19:02.479 align:start position:0%
addresses and if you know you should you
 
03:19:03.670 --> 03:19:03.680 align:start position:0%
should have that
 
03:19:08.870 --> 03:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:13.750 --> 03:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:16.950 --> 03:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
all got hit by the fire hose
 
03:19:27.590 --> 03:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:30.309 --> 03:19:30.319 align:start position:0%
your audio cut out on me yeah thank you
 
03:19:32.070 --> 03:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
03:19:34.950 --> 03:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
um my question goes in looking at the
 
03:19:36.630 --> 03:19:36.640 align:start position:0%
restructuring of
 
03:19:39.510 --> 03:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
the office um being around for a little
 
03:19:39.520 --> 03:19:40.309 align:start position:0%
the office um being around for a little
while

03:19:40.309 --> 03:19:40.319 align:start position:0%
while
 
03:19:42.630 --> 03:19:42.640 align:start position:0%
and watching as this legislation was
 
03:19:44.830 --> 03:19:44.840 align:start position:0%
passed and
 
03:19:48.150 --> 03:19:48.160 align:start position:0%
uh going forward
 
03:19:49.990 --> 03:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
it was my understanding we were just
 
03:19:52.550 --> 03:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
going to combine some of the
 
03:19:55.910 --> 03:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
functions and reduce duplication
 
03:19:59.510 --> 03:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
for numerous boards this
 
03:20:02.870 --> 03:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
now seems like it's a whole total revamp
 
03:20:05.190 --> 03:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
of the boards under the executive
 
03:20:07.110 --> 03:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
director of oplc
 
03:20:10.630 --> 03:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
and case in point is
 
03:20:13.990 --> 03:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
looking at investigations or
 
03:20:17.670 --> 03:20:17.680 align:start position:0%
if there's any complaints going forward
 
03:20:17.680 --> 03:20:18.309 align:start position:0%
if there's any complaints going forward
with

03:20:18.309 --> 03:20:18.319 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:20:20.070 --> 03:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
any of the boards that is going to go to
 
03:20:23.190 --> 03:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:25.830 --> 03:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
hearing process versus going to each
 
03:20:29.510 --> 03:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
individual board
 
03:20:31.429 --> 03:20:31.439 align:start position:0%
could you just let me know if i'm
 
03:20:33.670 --> 03:20:33.680 align:start position:0%
correct on that going forward and
 
03:20:36.870 --> 03:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
if so what is
 
03:20:39.269 --> 03:20:39.279 align:start position:0%
the reaction from these boards and not
 
03:20:41.030 --> 03:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
being able to do the hearings themselves
 
03:20:43.670 --> 03:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
as individual boards with their members
 
03:20:45.269 --> 03:20:45.279 align:start position:0%
yeah no thank you representative i
 
03:20:47.030 --> 03:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate the question so
 
03:20:48.710 --> 03:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
um to get into the nitty-gritty of what
 
03:20:50.150 --> 03:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
we're doing with complaints is that we
 
03:20:51.910 --> 03:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
actually worked with all boards to have
 
03:20:53.590 --> 03:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
them issue standing orders
 
03:20:55.429 --> 03:20:55.439 align:start position:0%
so they've all consented to this process
 
03:20:57.830 --> 03:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
those that are participating
 
03:21:00.050 --> 03:21:00.060 align:start position:0%
what we were finding is that
 
03:21:00.060 --> 03:21:01.670 align:start position:0%
what we were finding is that
[Music]

03:21:01.670 --> 03:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:21:03.190 --> 03:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
all of the complaints were originally
 
03:21:04.790 --> 03:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
going to board administrators
 
03:21:07.590 --> 03:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
and there was not a specific standard as
 
03:21:09.110 --> 03:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
to what they were supposed to be doing
 
03:21:10.630 --> 03:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
with those complaints
 
03:21:13.349 --> 03:21:13.359 align:start position:0%
some um sent letters to licensees some
 
03:21:14.790 --> 03:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
gave them to the boards
 
03:21:17.110 --> 03:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
some put them in a file drawer to be
 
03:21:17.120 --> 03:21:17.910 align:start position:0%
some put them in a file drawer to be
frank

03:21:17.910 --> 03:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
frank
 
03:21:20.229 --> 03:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
um some you know it just was not
 
03:21:21.670 --> 03:21:21.680 align:start position:0%
protective of the public which is the
 
03:21:23.030 --> 03:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
board's mission
 
03:21:25.349 --> 03:21:25.359 align:start position:0%
and so the boards have overwhelmingly
 
03:21:27.590 --> 03:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
been supportive of this idea that the
 
03:21:29.269 --> 03:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
complaint is now going to
 
03:21:32.870 --> 03:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
go to trained um enforcement
 
03:21:35.429 --> 03:21:35.439 align:start position:0%
um staff members who are going to take a
 
03:21:37.190 --> 03:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
look at the complaint assess whether or
 
03:21:39.030 --> 03:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
not it is an emergency or not
 
03:21:41.510 --> 03:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
if so notify the board so we can have an
 
03:21:42.950 --> 03:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
emergency meeting
 
03:21:45.269 --> 03:21:45.279 align:start position:0%
um if not then then everything is going
 
03:21:47.030 --> 03:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
to be treated the same in terms of the
 
03:21:48.469 --> 03:21:48.479 align:start position:0%
licensee gets a letter
 
03:21:51.429 --> 03:21:51.439 align:start position:0%
the licensee responds if records are
 
03:21:51.439 --> 03:21:52.070 align:start position:0%
the licensee responds if records are
needed

03:21:52.070 --> 03:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
needed
 
03:21:54.150 --> 03:21:54.160 align:start position:0%
um then they will get it you know then
 
03:21:55.429 --> 03:21:55.439 align:start position:0%
we'll get the records
 
03:21:57.429 --> 03:21:57.439 align:start position:0%
then we'll do a memo to the board saying
 
03:21:58.950 --> 03:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
this is what
 
03:22:00.469 --> 03:22:00.479 align:start position:0%
is in the complaint would you like to
 
03:22:02.309 --> 03:22:02.319 align:start position:0%
proceed with formal investigation and if
 
03:22:04.229 --> 03:22:04.239 align:start position:0%
so an order of formal investigation will
 
03:22:04.239 --> 03:22:05.750 align:start position:0%
so an order of formal investigation will
ensue

03:22:05.750 --> 03:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
ensue
 
03:22:07.590 --> 03:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
then an investigator will be appointed
 
03:22:09.110 --> 03:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
to work with either
 
03:22:11.510 --> 03:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
a recruits board member or you know an
 
03:22:11.520 --> 03:22:12.790 align:start position:0%
a recruits board member or you know an
investigator

03:22:12.790 --> 03:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
investigator
 
03:22:14.389 --> 03:22:14.399 align:start position:0%
and then it goes back to the board with
 
03:22:16.070 --> 03:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
a report of investigation and the board
 
03:22:17.670 --> 03:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
makes the decision about whether to
 
03:22:19.269 --> 03:22:19.279 align:start position:0%
proceed to discipline
 
03:22:22.229 --> 03:22:22.239 align:start position:0%
at all times the board is fully acting
 
03:22:25.030 --> 03:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
in an adjudicatory role
 
03:22:26.710 --> 03:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
i i think though that your question
 
03:22:30.150 --> 03:22:30.160 align:start position:0%
raises a very good
 
03:22:32.389 --> 03:22:32.399 align:start position:0%
point in that what we're finding with
 
03:22:33.510 --> 03:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
the office
 
03:22:35.910 --> 03:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
and we've contracted with clear the
 
03:22:37.030 --> 03:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
council on licensure
 
03:22:39.429 --> 03:22:39.439 align:start position:0%
enforcement and i forget the acronym but
 
03:22:40.469 --> 03:22:40.479 align:start position:0%
in any event
 
03:22:42.309 --> 03:22:42.319 align:start position:0%
um you know they're doing an analysis
 
03:22:43.590 --> 03:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
for us as well
 
03:22:46.150 --> 03:22:46.160 align:start position:0%
i i don't think that there's a consensus
 
03:22:46.950 --> 03:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
03:22:49.990 --> 03:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
about what the purpose of the office is
 
03:22:53.110 --> 03:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
um and i think that has led to some some
 
03:22:56.469 --> 03:22:56.479 align:start position:0%
some issues right in terms of you know
 
03:22:59.349 --> 03:22:59.359 align:start position:0%
are we um and i know others have told me
 
03:23:00.790 --> 03:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
that we're supposed to just be paying
 
03:23:00.800 --> 03:23:01.510 align:start position:0%
that we're supposed to just be paying
rent

03:23:01.510 --> 03:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
rent
 
03:23:03.429 --> 03:23:03.439 align:start position:0%
or are we really supposed to be ensuring
 
03:23:04.950 --> 03:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
efficiency and what does that
 
03:23:08.630 --> 03:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
look like um i think that question has
 
03:23:10.870 --> 03:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
to be answered in order for the office
 
03:23:11.349 --> 03:23:11.359 align:start position:0%
to be
 
03:23:14.950 --> 03:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
successful i can tell you that
 
03:23:18.070 --> 03:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
around 23 other states have umbrella
 
03:23:18.080 --> 03:23:19.510 align:start position:0%
around 23 other states have umbrella
agencies

03:23:19.510 --> 03:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
03:23:22.790 --> 03:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
and um at least the four that were
 
03:23:24.229 --> 03:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
surveyed as part of our
 
03:23:26.070 --> 03:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
analysis through clear and it's a draft
 
03:23:27.830 --> 03:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
form and i can provide that to you once
 
03:23:29.190 --> 03:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
it's completed
 
03:23:31.670 --> 03:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
um i have not observed the similar
 
03:23:33.670 --> 03:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
issues in other states regarding this
 
03:23:35.910 --> 03:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
this you know um talking poll with
 
03:23:37.429 --> 03:23:37.439 align:start position:0%
regard to authority
 
03:23:39.190 --> 03:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
i think in order for us to get where we
 
03:23:41.510 --> 03:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
need to be in terms of
 
03:23:43.670 --> 03:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
appropriately protecting the public and
 
03:23:45.990 --> 03:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
also ensuring that their regulations
 
03:23:47.990 --> 03:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
are sufficient to meet minimum standards
 
03:23:49.750 --> 03:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
there has to be oversight
 
03:23:53.190 --> 03:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
and what we were seeing with uh with
 
03:23:54.870 --> 03:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
with what was handled what was going on
 
03:23:56.229 --> 03:23:56.239 align:start position:0%
with complaints
 
03:23:59.110 --> 03:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
is that um and that's just a microcosm
 
03:24:00.870 --> 03:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
of the issue in general
 
03:24:02.389 --> 03:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
is that there were complaints that were
 
03:24:04.469 --> 03:24:04.479 align:start position:0%
not being adjudicated for years
 
03:24:06.870 --> 03:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
one year two year three years that's
 
03:24:08.550 --> 03:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
really unacceptable from a public
 
03:24:10.710 --> 03:24:10.720 align:start position:0%
protection standpoint it's also not fair
 
03:24:12.469 --> 03:24:12.479 align:start position:0%
for the licensee who needs to get back
 
03:24:14.070 --> 03:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
to work and not have this hanging over
 
03:24:15.030 --> 03:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
their heads
 
03:24:16.870 --> 03:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
and so i think providing that oversight
 
03:24:18.710 --> 03:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
and really assisting um the boards
 
03:24:20.550 --> 03:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
administer those reducing the time
 
03:24:21.990 --> 03:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
frames is our
 
03:24:24.150 --> 03:24:24.160 align:start position:0%
is our end goal but i agree with you
 
03:24:25.590 --> 03:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
representative i think
 
03:24:27.190 --> 03:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
i think there are some questions out
 
03:24:28.630 --> 03:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
there that need to be answered in terms
 
03:24:30.550 --> 03:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
of what our overall
 
03:24:32.309 --> 03:24:32.319 align:start position:0%
goal is because my goal it doesn't
 
03:24:33.670 --> 03:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
always line up with with
 
03:24:35.750 --> 03:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
maybe what others believe it it should
 
03:24:35.760 --> 03:24:38.710 align:start position:0%
maybe what others believe it it should
be

03:24:38.710 --> 03:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:40.710 --> 03:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
thank you and i think uh the performance
 
03:24:41.750 --> 03:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
audit will help but
 
03:24:43.190 --> 03:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
also going forward and seeing what that
 
03:24:45.510 --> 03:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
comes out is
 
03:24:51.590 --> 03:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:53.990 --> 03:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman uh thank you
 
03:24:55.830 --> 03:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
03:24:59.590 --> 03:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
so um just uh from an experi
 
03:25:01.750 --> 03:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
experience standpoint i was actually an
 
03:25:03.269 --> 03:25:03.279 align:start position:0%
investigator for the massachusetts
 
03:25:05.590 --> 03:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
border registration and medicine
 
03:25:08.710 --> 03:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
and it's a very very complex field to
 
03:25:08.720 --> 03:25:10.070 align:start position:0%
and it's a very very complex field to
investigate

03:25:10.070 --> 03:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
investigate
 
03:25:12.790 --> 03:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
and it takes a very specific skill set
 
03:25:15.349 --> 03:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
and a very specific background knowledge
 
03:25:17.510 --> 03:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
in medicine frankly and we had
 
03:25:19.590 --> 03:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
investigators we had nurse investigators
 
03:25:20.710 --> 03:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
and we had attorneys
 
03:25:24.150 --> 03:25:24.160 align:start position:0%
all assigned to that i cannot imagine
 
03:25:26.550 --> 03:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
a person who has that skill set also
 
03:25:27.990 --> 03:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
being able to do a thorough
 
03:25:29.590 --> 03:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
investigation into
 
03:25:31.990 --> 03:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
building inspectors or home inspectors
 
03:25:33.750 --> 03:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
how is it that we're going to be able to
 
03:25:36.710 --> 03:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
coalesce all this into one without
 
03:25:38.309 --> 03:25:38.319 align:start position:0%
actually letting the public down because
 
03:25:39.510 --> 03:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
we're not able to do a thorough
 
03:25:41.349 --> 03:25:41.359 align:start position:0%
investigation because of the
 
03:25:43.110 --> 03:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
specific background needed by these
 
03:25:43.120 --> 03:25:45.349 align:start position:0%
specific background needed by these
people

03:25:45.349 --> 03:25:45.359 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:25:47.349 --> 03:25:47.359 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a great question um so what
 
03:25:48.870 --> 03:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
we've done is we've collaborated with
 
03:25:51.830 --> 03:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
the boards the boards were previously
 
03:25:54.070 --> 03:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
and i say i'm talking generally but
 
03:25:55.030 --> 03:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
every board had
 
03:25:57.590 --> 03:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
their own process which was which was
 
03:25:59.349 --> 03:25:59.359 align:start position:0%
precisely the problem
 
03:26:02.389 --> 03:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
um but the large majority of boards
 
03:26:04.550 --> 03:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
were recusing board members or they had
 
03:26:05.830 --> 03:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
members of a subcommittee
 
03:26:09.190 --> 03:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
in that field and they were asked to go
 
03:26:11.349 --> 03:26:11.359 align:start position:0%
out and do all the interviews and get
 
03:26:13.429 --> 03:26:13.439 align:start position:0%
all the records and
 
03:26:16.630 --> 03:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
um you know push the paper around
 
03:26:18.790 --> 03:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
and so what i think is appropriate and
 
03:26:20.469 --> 03:26:20.479 align:start position:0%
we also have a physician
 
03:26:22.710 --> 03:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
um that we contract with we also have
 
03:26:24.150 --> 03:26:24.160 align:start position:0%
nurses on staff
 
03:26:25.750 --> 03:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
um we have a medical review subcommittee
 
03:26:27.429 --> 03:26:27.439 align:start position:0%
comprised solely of physicians that we
 
03:26:28.389 --> 03:26:28.399 align:start position:0%
work with
 
03:26:30.150 --> 03:26:30.160 align:start position:0%
but i think it's very important that we
 
03:26:32.790 --> 03:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
utilize our experts for their expertise
 
03:26:34.950 --> 03:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
but it's not really fair in my opinion
 
03:26:36.309 --> 03:26:36.319 align:start position:0%
to ask them to go do all that
 
03:26:37.750 --> 03:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
administrative work
 
03:26:39.510 --> 03:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
so the process that we've proposed that
 
03:26:40.950 --> 03:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
we're working with the boards on
 
03:26:43.349 --> 03:26:43.359 align:start position:0%
is that we pair up an action you know a
 
03:26:45.110 --> 03:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
professional investigator
 
03:26:48.150 --> 03:26:48.160 align:start position:0%
um with the experts and they can work
 
03:26:49.670 --> 03:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
together in putting that report of
 
03:26:49.680 --> 03:26:50.550 align:start position:0%
together in putting that report of
investigation

03:26:50.550 --> 03:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
03:26:52.630 --> 03:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
together because i agree and not all
 
03:26:54.710 --> 03:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
cases are quality of care cases some of
 
03:26:54.720 --> 03:26:55.030 align:start position:0%
cases are quality of care cases some of
them

03:26:55.030 --> 03:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:26:56.309 --> 03:26:56.319 align:start position:0%
you know it's patently obvious that
 
03:26:58.150 --> 03:26:58.160 align:start position:0%
there could be gross negligence
 
03:27:00.630 --> 03:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
but there are cases that do many cases
 
03:27:02.950 --> 03:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
that require that level of expertise
 
03:27:04.550 --> 03:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
but i think we need to be utilizing them
 
03:27:05.990 --> 03:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
for their expertise
 
03:27:07.830 --> 03:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
and then we can promote people wanting
 
03:27:09.590 --> 03:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
to volunteer and participate in the
 
03:27:11.190 --> 03:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
process because that's another issue we
 
03:27:13.110 --> 03:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
have is recruiting members
 
03:27:15.510 --> 03:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
um and so i hope that answers your
 
03:27:18.070 --> 03:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
question i i fully agree with you and i
 
03:27:19.429 --> 03:27:19.439 align:start position:0%
think that we need to be
 
03:27:22.469 --> 03:27:22.479 align:start position:0%
utilizing uh the expertise of those uh
 
03:27:25.030 --> 03:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
who are plainly volunteering their their
 
03:27:25.040 --> 03:27:25.750 align:start position:0%
who are plainly volunteering their their
precious

03:27:25.750 --> 03:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
precious
 
03:27:28.870 --> 03:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
time to to assist with public safety
 
03:27:32.309 --> 03:27:32.319 align:start position:0%
follow up madam chair follow up yeah i
 
03:27:33.830 --> 03:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
guess you kind of touched on the answer
 
03:27:35.590 --> 03:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
i'm looking for um
 
03:27:37.990 --> 03:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
so for let me just give you an example
 
03:27:39.429 --> 03:27:39.439 align:start position:0%
in the medicine field
 
03:27:42.870 --> 03:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
um you've got a couple primary issues
 
03:27:44.630 --> 03:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
and standard of care usually isn't with
 
03:27:45.670 --> 03:27:45.680 align:start position:0%
the biggest one you're going to have
 
03:27:47.110 --> 03:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
over prescribing
 
03:27:48.389 --> 03:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
you're going to have inappropriate
 
03:27:51.590 --> 03:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
conduct um with with patients
 
03:27:55.670 --> 03:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
and in those fields
 
03:27:57.830 --> 03:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
just doing the investigation you have to
 
03:27:59.269 --> 03:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
know what you're looking for
 
03:28:01.510 --> 03:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
so sending out a generally trained
 
03:28:01.520 --> 03:28:02.870 align:start position:0%
so sending out a generally trained
investigator

03:28:02.870 --> 03:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
investigator
 
03:28:04.389 --> 03:28:04.399 align:start position:0%
to take statements you're going to miss
 
03:28:06.469 --> 03:28:06.479 align:start position:0%
a lot of things so that's that's
 
03:28:08.150 --> 03:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
so like what we used to do is we had a
 
03:28:10.790 --> 03:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
nurse an investigator an attorney signed
 
03:28:11.910 --> 03:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
to each case
 
03:28:13.590 --> 03:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
now i know you don't have the money to
 
03:28:16.229 --> 03:28:16.239 align:start position:0%
do that but that shows you the level of
 
03:28:18.150 --> 03:28:18.160 align:start position:0%
intricacy involved in investigating a
 
03:28:19.750 --> 03:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
medicine case
 
03:28:21.910 --> 03:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
versus some of the other i mean all the
 
03:28:23.590 --> 03:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
different boards you have in speciality
 
03:28:25.750 --> 03:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
so that's what my concern is if we just
 
03:28:26.870 --> 03:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
kind of say okay everybody's an
 
03:28:28.790 --> 03:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
investigator for everything
 
03:28:31.110 --> 03:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
um you know the old saying about jack of
 
03:28:32.790 --> 03:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
all trades
 
03:28:34.469 --> 03:28:34.479 align:start position:0%
you know i agree with you representative
 
03:28:36.150 --> 03:28:36.160 align:start position:0%
and i think i could spend a whole
 
03:28:39.110 --> 03:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
you know hour too long presentation and
 
03:28:39.590 --> 03:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:28:41.349 --> 03:28:41.359 align:start position:0%
dialogue regarding our investigation
 
03:28:42.630 --> 03:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
process because it's the first thing
 
03:28:43.990 --> 03:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
that we worked on
 
03:28:46.950 --> 03:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
um my i my goal is to get to a point
 
03:28:48.550 --> 03:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
where we have an attorney a nurse or
 
03:28:51.030 --> 03:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
whomever it is assigned to every case
 
03:28:52.550 --> 03:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
obviously there are budgetary issues
 
03:28:54.790 --> 03:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
which maybe i you know i get my
 
03:28:57.190 --> 03:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
general court to help us out with um i
 
03:28:58.710 --> 03:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
come from background of private practice
 
03:29:00.229 --> 03:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
where i did male practice work so that
 
03:29:01.190 --> 03:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
was our
 
03:29:04.070 --> 03:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
um that was our model when i was in
 
03:29:05.429 --> 03:29:05.439 align:start position:0%
private practice
 
03:29:08.790 --> 03:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
um so the way we've gotten the way we've
 
03:29:11.670 --> 03:29:11.680 align:start position:0%
we've worked within our resources now is
 
03:29:12.309 --> 03:29:12.319 align:start position:0%
to really
 
03:29:14.790 --> 03:29:14.800 align:start position:0%
leverage um the volunteer experience we
 
03:29:16.469 --> 03:29:16.479 align:start position:0%
have so we do have attorneys in the
 
03:29:18.070 --> 03:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
office that drive
 
03:29:20.710 --> 03:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
that work with our um our professional
 
03:29:20.720 --> 03:29:21.830 align:start position:0%
that work with our um our professional
investigator

03:29:21.830 --> 03:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
investigator
 
03:29:25.750 --> 03:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
who has um experience in in a particular
 
03:29:28.469 --> 03:29:28.479 align:start position:0%
different fields who also works with the
 
03:29:30.389 --> 03:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
assigned either physician
 
03:29:33.990 --> 03:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
or um other you know experts
 
03:29:36.790 --> 03:29:36.800 align:start position:0%
um to to determine how an investigation
 
03:29:38.630 --> 03:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
should proceed
 
03:29:40.389 --> 03:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
well just a follow-up comment madam
 
03:29:42.389 --> 03:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
chair um well if
 
03:29:44.070 --> 03:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
if this legislation that's going to
 
03:29:45.830 --> 03:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
enable all this is going to come before
 
03:29:47.510 --> 03:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
us this year i would suggest you to
 
03:29:47.990 --> 03:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
bring that
 
03:29:49.750 --> 03:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
hour and a half presentation because i'm
 
03:29:51.750 --> 03:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
going to want to hear all of it
 
03:29:55.030 --> 03:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:58.870 --> 03:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:01.830 --> 03:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair hi miss courtney
 
03:30:04.550 --> 03:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
nice to see you
 
03:30:07.910 --> 03:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
my my original idea was
 
03:30:11.349 --> 03:30:11.359 align:start position:0%
similar to representative goalie
 
03:30:15.110 --> 03:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
and roy's concerns that
 
03:30:18.469 --> 03:30:18.479 align:start position:0%
with the diversity of boards i'm not
 
03:30:19.349 --> 03:30:19.359 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
03:30:22.790 --> 03:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
a one-size-fits-all approach
 
03:30:25.830 --> 03:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
is going to be appropriate so we will be
 
03:30:27.750 --> 03:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
looking at that closely
 
03:30:31.190 --> 03:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
my question specifically though was
 
03:30:34.150 --> 03:30:34.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned the performance audit did i
 
03:30:36.389 --> 03:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
hear you say that you were having the
 
03:30:39.830 --> 03:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
oh session on that today
 
03:30:41.990 --> 03:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
no we had an entrance meeting so it's
 
03:30:44.150 --> 03:30:44.160 align:start position:0%
just the kickoff
 
03:30:46.630 --> 03:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
uh the kickoff meeting was today i said
 
03:30:49.510 --> 03:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:52.630 --> 03:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
yeah so it's just beginning
 
03:30:55.670 --> 03:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
correct correct okay thank you you're
 
03:30:57.349 --> 03:30:57.359 align:start position:0%
welcome that was my question
 
03:30:58.870 --> 03:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
we will be getting that performance
 
03:31:00.550 --> 03:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
audit once it is complete
 
03:31:02.550 --> 03:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
no doubt about it right i just was
 
03:31:03.830 --> 03:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
curious about
 
03:31:05.590 --> 03:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
what kind of time frame we were looking
 
03:31:05.600 --> 03:31:07.670 align:start position:0%
what kind of time frame we were looking
at

03:31:07.670 --> 03:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
at
 
03:31:09.830 --> 03:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh probably before the end of june i'd
 
03:31:12.229 --> 03:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
say but not that much
 
03:31:13.670 --> 03:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
yeah if they're just starting that's
 
03:31:15.670 --> 03:31:15.680 align:start position:0%
what i'm thinking i just like i said
 
03:31:17.670 --> 03:31:17.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to see where they were
 
03:31:22.070 --> 03:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
okay representative schmidt
 
03:31:26.630 --> 03:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um and
 
03:31:31.510 --> 03:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh i'd like to uh associate myself with
 
03:31:33.670 --> 03:31:33.680 align:start position:0%
the remarks of the previous questioners
 
03:31:34.950 --> 03:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
on the committee
 
03:31:38.389 --> 03:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
uh some of us have been at this uh for a
 
03:31:40.229 --> 03:31:40.239 align:start position:0%
long time
 
03:31:44.389 --> 03:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
and we are confronted by
 
03:31:46.710 --> 03:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of issues first of all there are
 
03:31:48.229 --> 03:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
multiple boards
 
03:31:51.510 --> 03:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh that have come in at different
 
03:31:54.309 --> 03:31:54.319 align:start position:0%
times some have been licensed for you
 
03:31:54.319 --> 03:31:54.870 align:start position:0%
times some have been licensed for you
know

03:31:54.870 --> 03:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:31:57.429 --> 03:31:57.439 align:start position:0%
decades or even more than a century
 
03:31:59.349 --> 03:31:59.359 align:start position:0%
others have been licensed
 
03:32:02.710 --> 03:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
you know very recently and
 
03:32:07.030 --> 03:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
it is kind of a hodgepodge for sure
 
03:32:09.990 --> 03:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
and so some degree of standardization is
 
03:32:11.990 --> 03:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
not something i would oppose
 
03:32:15.030 --> 03:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh and and uh and an attempt to
 
03:32:17.990 --> 03:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
reorganize as something that i also
 
03:32:18.000 --> 03:32:18.469 align:start position:0%
reorganize as something that i also
think

03:32:18.469 --> 03:32:18.479 align:start position:0%
think
 
03:32:21.269 --> 03:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
is necessary because the the whole
 
03:32:21.990 --> 03:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
concept was
 
03:32:24.710 --> 03:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
put together and i first of all need to
 
03:32:25.269 --> 03:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
03:32:27.269 --> 03:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
make sure you understand i i've been on
 
03:32:29.910 --> 03:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
the committee now for 15 years
 
03:32:33.190 --> 03:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
um so and we have been dealing with
 
03:32:36.229 --> 03:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
uh this entire process uh in
 
03:32:39.990 --> 03:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
in fits and starts uh during that entire
 
03:32:40.000 --> 03:32:40.870 align:start position:0%
in fits and starts uh during that entire
period

03:32:40.870 --> 03:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
period
 
03:32:43.830 --> 03:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
without ever really having that much of
 
03:32:45.910 --> 03:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
a handle on what was going behind
 
03:32:50.550 --> 03:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
on behind the high wall um
 
03:32:53.349 --> 03:32:53.359 align:start position:0%
we would sometimes hear complaints uh
 
03:32:53.359 --> 03:32:54.469 align:start position:0%
we would sometimes hear complaints uh
about

03:32:54.469 --> 03:32:54.479 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:32:56.630 --> 03:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
administrators or administrative
 
03:32:58.950 --> 03:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
procedures and so forth and so on
 
03:33:01.750 --> 03:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
all without having much access to the
 
03:33:01.760 --> 03:33:02.309 align:start position:0%
all without having much access to the
facts

03:33:02.309 --> 03:33:02.319 align:start position:0%
facts
 
03:33:04.870 --> 03:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh for quite a while but also not
 
03:33:06.950 --> 03:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily having any experience in
 
03:33:06.960 --> 03:33:07.830 align:start position:0%
necessarily having any experience in
management

03:33:07.830 --> 03:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
management
 
03:33:09.590 --> 03:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
i don't have any management background
 
03:33:11.030 --> 03:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
to speak of
 
03:33:13.830 --> 03:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
and i don't profess to you know be able
 
03:33:13.840 --> 03:33:14.309 align:start position:0%
and i don't profess to you know be able
to

03:33:14.309 --> 03:33:14.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:33:17.110 --> 03:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
come in there and with a clean broom and
 
03:33:17.120 --> 03:33:17.590 align:start position:0%
come in there and with a clean broom and
and

03:33:17.590 --> 03:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:33:20.790 --> 03:33:20.800 align:start position:0%
and clean house uh but there it is clear
 
03:33:22.870 --> 03:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
that that when the
 
03:33:25.990 --> 03:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
oplc was conceived of and created
 
03:33:28.870 --> 03:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
that it was intended to reduce
 
03:33:30.229 --> 03:33:30.239 align:start position:0%
redundancy and
 
03:33:32.870 --> 03:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
in enhanced efficiency and so forth and
 
03:33:33.750 --> 03:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
so on
 
03:33:36.229 --> 03:33:36.239 align:start position:0%
um another thing i'd like to reference
 
03:33:36.239 --> 03:33:36.950 align:start position:0%
um another thing i'd like to reference
here

03:33:36.950 --> 03:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:33:40.630 --> 03:33:40.640 align:start position:0%
uh is that um although
 
03:33:42.790 --> 03:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
the the boards most of the boards are
 
03:33:42.800 --> 03:33:43.990 align:start position:0%
the the boards most of the boards are
125

03:33:43.990 --> 03:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
125
 
03:33:47.349 --> 03:33:47.359 align:start position:0%
boards uh and were intended to
 
03:33:50.630 --> 03:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
uh to you know make the
 
03:33:53.030 --> 03:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
the the professions and the pr and the
 
03:33:53.040 --> 03:33:54.150 align:start position:0%
the the professions and the pr and the
occupations

03:33:54.150 --> 03:33:54.160 align:start position:0%
occupations
 
03:33:56.870 --> 03:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
pay for their own administration i think
 
03:33:56.880 --> 03:33:57.349 align:start position:0%
pay for their own administration i think
that's

03:33:57.349 --> 03:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:34:00.389 --> 03:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
not an unreasonable premise
 
03:34:04.630 --> 03:34:04.640 align:start position:0%
but that they were not intended to be
 
03:34:05.990 --> 03:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
cash cows
 
03:34:09.990 --> 03:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
for uh for the general fund
 
03:34:14.710 --> 03:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
but that they were in some cases
 
03:34:18.550 --> 03:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
by accident or just perhaps on purpose
 
03:34:21.590 --> 03:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
turned into cash cows and and that i
 
03:34:23.269 --> 03:34:23.279 align:start position:0%
totally opposed and i think
 
03:34:25.750 --> 03:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
i speak for most of my you know
 
03:34:27.349 --> 03:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
experienced colleagues in that
 
03:34:31.590 --> 03:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
regard that we certainly do not want to
 
03:34:35.030 --> 03:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
leave fees at levels that produce
 
03:34:37.990 --> 03:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
extra revenues for the state how does
 
03:34:39.990 --> 03:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
however desperately the state may need
 
03:34:41.190 --> 03:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
extra revenue
 
03:34:43.670 --> 03:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
that's not the way to get them by using
 
03:34:44.710 --> 03:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
the professions
 
03:34:47.750 --> 03:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
as no levers or
 
03:34:50.070 --> 03:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
as knee breakers effectively because you
 
03:34:51.190 --> 03:34:51.200 align:start position:0%
got to pay or
 
03:34:54.790 --> 03:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
you don't get to play so
 
03:34:58.790 --> 03:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
it's clear that that this whole process
 
03:35:02.229 --> 03:35:02.239 align:start position:0%
is a very complex uh and
 
03:35:04.389 --> 03:35:04.399 align:start position:0%
and and also to some degree very
 
03:35:04.399 --> 03:35:05.510 align:start position:0%
and and also to some degree very
entrenched

03:35:05.510 --> 03:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
entrenched
 
03:35:08.950 --> 03:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
and redoing it will be difficult uh
 
03:35:10.630 --> 03:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
but one of the things that it seems to
 
03:35:12.630 --> 03:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
me that is necessary
 
03:35:16.070 --> 03:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
is or would be advantageous is if we
 
03:35:18.070 --> 03:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
are looking at what some other states
 
03:35:20.070 --> 03:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
are doing so that we are not
 
03:35:23.510 --> 03:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
inventing the wheel entirely on our own
 
03:35:25.429 --> 03:35:25.439 align:start position:0%
it seems to me like you're going at this
 
03:35:26.950 --> 03:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
with a lot of
 
03:35:29.990 --> 03:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
zeal and a lot of
 
03:35:33.110 --> 03:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
elbow grease but but
 
03:35:35.190 --> 03:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
the question is whether we have the
 
03:35:36.550 --> 03:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
necessary management
 
03:35:39.269 --> 03:35:39.279 align:start position:0%
expertise to and whether it really makes
 
03:35:40.309 --> 03:35:40.319 align:start position:0%
sense for us to
 
03:35:43.429 --> 03:35:43.439 align:start position:0%
invent the wheel here uh in an attempt
 
03:35:44.790 --> 03:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
to get to
 
03:35:46.550 --> 03:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
something that protects the public you
 
03:35:48.150 --> 03:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
reference that several times in your
 
03:35:48.160 --> 03:35:49.429 align:start position:0%
reference that several times in your
testimony

03:35:49.429 --> 03:35:49.439 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
03:35:53.190 --> 03:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh to in to protect the public but also
 
03:35:56.070 --> 03:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
to uh promote and protect the trades and
 
03:35:56.080 --> 03:35:57.269 align:start position:0%
to uh promote and protect the trades and
professions

03:35:57.269 --> 03:35:57.279 align:start position:0%
professions
 
03:36:01.030 --> 03:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh that's all an important function
 
03:36:03.750 --> 03:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
you reference pdmp and i didn't hear you
 
03:36:03.760 --> 03:36:04.550 align:start position:0%
you reference pdmp and i didn't hear you
say

03:36:04.550 --> 03:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
say
 
03:36:08.070 --> 03:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
that uh that one of the functions was
 
03:36:11.990 --> 03:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
to prevent you know illegal
 
03:36:15.190 --> 03:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
acquisition and use of
 
03:36:17.269 --> 03:36:17.279 align:start position:0%
of various different medications by
 
03:36:19.110 --> 03:36:19.120 align:start position:0%
people who are
 
03:36:22.389 --> 03:36:22.399 align:start position:0%
not in fact ill or needing medication at
 
03:36:23.349 --> 03:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
all but who are
 
03:36:26.950 --> 03:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
operators who are attempting to you know
 
03:36:30.150 --> 03:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
get uh illicit uh
 
03:36:33.510 --> 03:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
drugs in their into their hands
 
03:36:35.590 --> 03:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
for sales and so forth and so on and it
 
03:36:37.510 --> 03:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
was a monitoring program
 
03:36:40.550 --> 03:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh and i didn't hear you say that so
 
03:36:43.429 --> 03:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
i think that's possibly the most
 
03:36:44.630 --> 03:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
important driver
 
03:36:47.269 --> 03:36:47.279 align:start position:0%
of the creation of the what was
 
03:36:50.710 --> 03:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
originally the pmp and then became pdmp
 
03:36:53.830 --> 03:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
um but anyway so i
 
03:36:55.510 --> 03:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
but i've been involved in a lot of these
 
03:36:57.429 --> 03:36:57.439 align:start position:0%
processes and
 
03:37:00.550 --> 03:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
i i i've come to recognize that
 
03:37:02.710 --> 03:37:02.720 align:start position:0%
that there's a great deal of expertise
 
03:37:04.070 --> 03:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
in the boards
 
03:37:06.870 --> 03:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
that is an important ingredient of the
 
03:37:07.830 --> 03:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
whole thing
 
03:37:10.550 --> 03:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
so one of my questions is how much
 
03:37:12.150 --> 03:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
resistance are you getting from the
 
03:37:13.910 --> 03:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
boards that seems to be
 
03:37:17.830 --> 03:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
inappropriate as opposed to appropriate
 
03:37:19.590 --> 03:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for that for that
 
03:37:22.710 --> 03:37:22.720 align:start position:0%
question um
 
03:37:24.950 --> 03:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
just just to step back a little bit we
 
03:37:26.309 --> 03:37:26.319 align:start position:0%
are looking at what other states are
 
03:37:27.590 --> 03:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
doing through clear
 
03:37:29.830 --> 03:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
and i anticipate having a final report
 
03:37:29.840 --> 03:37:30.710 align:start position:0%
and i anticipate having a final report
soon

03:37:30.710 --> 03:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
soon
 
03:37:33.110 --> 03:37:33.120 align:start position:0%
um but we contracted with clear to do an
 
03:37:34.710 --> 03:37:34.720 align:start position:0%
overall analysis
 
03:37:37.990 --> 03:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
um again as i mentioned 23 states i have
 
03:37:39.990 --> 03:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
a similar umbrella agency so we
 
03:37:42.070 --> 03:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
i agree we shouldn't reinvent the wheel
 
03:37:43.110 --> 03:37:43.120 align:start position:0%
and we um
 
03:37:44.550 --> 03:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't we're not going at this
 
03:37:47.110 --> 03:37:47.120 align:start position:0%
blindly um a lot of them have a similar
 
03:37:48.710 --> 03:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
structure to oplc
 
03:37:50.469 --> 03:37:50.479 align:start position:0%
and the ones that were interviewed do
 
03:37:51.830 --> 03:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
not have the same issues
 
03:37:54.150 --> 03:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire has in terms of this
 
03:37:55.910 --> 03:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
this question about what is the purpose
 
03:37:58.389 --> 03:37:58.399 align:start position:0%
of an umbrella agency um
 
03:37:59.910 --> 03:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
and the authority of the boards versus
 
03:38:01.510 --> 03:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
the agency um
 
03:38:03.429 --> 03:38:03.439 align:start position:0%
in fact when i was when i was speaking
 
03:38:05.510 --> 03:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
with our consultants at clear
 
03:38:06.870 --> 03:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of the other states were even
 
03:38:08.550 --> 03:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
offended by the question
 
03:38:10.550 --> 03:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
um and i think part of that has to do
 
03:38:11.990 --> 03:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
with the fact that
 
03:38:13.910 --> 03:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
the agencies have existed for a lot
 
03:38:15.670 --> 03:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
longer than new hampshire
 
03:38:18.150 --> 03:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
um and i think part of it has to do with
 
03:38:19.030 --> 03:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
the fact that
 
03:38:21.670 --> 03:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
there hasn't been a clear pathway for
 
03:38:21.680 --> 03:38:23.990 align:start position:0%
there hasn't been a clear pathway for
oplc

03:38:23.990 --> 03:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
03:38:26.790 --> 03:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
as an agency both in strategy but also
 
03:38:27.910 --> 03:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:38:31.269 --> 03:38:31.279 align:start position:0%
in statute so um so that's the first
 
03:38:32.950 --> 03:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
part of it i'm really looking forward to
 
03:38:34.550 --> 03:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
seeing that final report because i think
 
03:38:36.469 --> 03:38:36.479 align:start position:0%
that'll provide us with some good
 
03:38:38.630 --> 03:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
um talking points and and for ways for
 
03:38:40.630 --> 03:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
us to make some decisions
 
03:38:43.590 --> 03:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
um you know the second piece of that is
 
03:38:45.269 --> 03:38:45.279 align:start position:0%
how are the boards feeling
 
03:38:49.030 --> 03:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
um i fully believe in collaboration
 
03:38:51.830 --> 03:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately that takes a lot longer
 
03:38:51.840 --> 03:38:52.309 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately that takes a lot longer
and

03:38:52.309 --> 03:38:52.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:38:55.830 --> 03:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
um i think agents i think oplc has been
 
03:38:58.150 --> 03:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
in crisis for about five years
 
03:39:00.309 --> 03:39:00.319 align:start position:0%
and since its inception as we've seen
 
03:39:01.510 --> 03:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
with that with the
 
03:39:03.429 --> 03:39:03.439 align:start position:0%
constant turnover for executive
 
03:39:03.439 --> 03:39:04.710 align:start position:0%
constant turnover for executive
management

03:39:04.710 --> 03:39:04.720 align:start position:0%
management
 
03:39:06.710 --> 03:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
um the issues within the agency and i
 
03:39:07.830 --> 03:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
have a lot of
 
03:39:10.870 --> 03:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
opinions as to why that is um it's not
 
03:39:12.870 --> 03:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
really an operating environment uh
 
03:39:14.950 --> 03:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
that anybody really wants to work on so
 
03:39:16.309 --> 03:39:16.319 align:start position:0%
we're trying to address that in an
 
03:39:18.070 --> 03:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
expeditious manner
 
03:39:20.550 --> 03:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
um but i think a lot of the boards in
 
03:39:21.990 --> 03:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
collaborating with them
 
03:39:23.910 --> 03:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
um they have gotten on board because
 
03:39:25.590 --> 03:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
they have also
 
03:39:28.950 --> 03:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
been tired of of the issues that um
 
03:39:31.189 --> 03:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
that we've had we've had to deal with
 
03:39:32.950 --> 03:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
and i'll give you that example for
 
03:39:36.229 --> 03:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
for our enforcement unit um we had been
 
03:39:36.239 --> 03:39:36.710 align:start position:0%
for our enforcement unit um we had been
sending

03:39:36.710 --> 03:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
sending
 
03:39:38.070 --> 03:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
the majority of our cases over to the
 
03:39:39.269 --> 03:39:39.279 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office and the
 
03:39:41.030 --> 03:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
administrative prosecutions unit we
 
03:39:41.990 --> 03:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
obviously have
 
03:39:45.030 --> 03:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
um we have an agreement with them um and
 
03:39:47.349 --> 03:39:47.359 align:start position:0%
we fully fund their apu
 
03:39:51.189 --> 03:39:51.199 align:start position:0%
and um we started to see some
 
03:39:54.150 --> 03:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
some resource issues um and obviously
 
03:39:56.150 --> 03:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
cases were lagging at two or three years
 
03:39:58.389 --> 03:39:58.399 align:start position:0%
which is completely unacceptable
 
03:40:02.150 --> 03:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
um and so we said we there needs to be
 
03:40:04.469 --> 03:40:04.479 align:start position:0%
more oversight and the boards are
 
03:40:07.349 --> 03:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
fully agree in agreement with that so we
 
03:40:08.389 --> 03:40:08.399 align:start position:0%
created this new
 
03:40:10.550 --> 03:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
structure in-house where we are
 
03:40:13.429 --> 03:40:13.439 align:start position:0%
accountable we are providing oversight
 
03:40:16.309 --> 03:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
um if cases are taking on too long i can
 
03:40:17.910 --> 03:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
go down to my staff and say what is
 
03:40:19.590 --> 03:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
going on you need to prioritize this
 
03:40:20.950 --> 03:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
this is a problem
 
03:40:22.550 --> 03:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
and there's that accountability and the
 
03:40:23.990 --> 03:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
boards are seeing that
 
03:40:25.590 --> 03:40:25.600 align:start position:0%
and all of them agreed through a
 
03:40:27.030 --> 03:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
standing order the ones you know the
 
03:40:28.389 --> 03:40:28.399 align:start position:0%
ones that we're bringing on board i
 
03:40:30.630 --> 03:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
think mental health is the last one
 
03:40:33.030 --> 03:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
um they've all done this voluntarily
 
03:40:34.950 --> 03:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
through collaboration
 
03:40:37.990 --> 03:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
so we may not all always agree regarding
 
03:40:40.710 --> 03:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
um you know the process but we've gotten
 
03:40:42.710 --> 03:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
to a point where i think we've developed
 
03:40:44.550 --> 03:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
good relationships with the majority of
 
03:40:46.229 --> 03:40:46.239 align:start position:0%
them that they're willing to try
 
03:40:47.110 --> 03:40:47.120 align:start position:0%
something new
 
03:40:48.469 --> 03:40:48.479 align:start position:0%
because what we've been doing hasn't
 
03:40:50.309 --> 03:40:50.319 align:start position:0%
been working what the boards were doing
 
03:40:51.990 --> 03:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
i don't think had been working
 
03:40:54.229 --> 03:40:54.239 align:start position:0%
um because these are full-time
 
03:40:56.070 --> 03:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
professionals who for the most part
 
03:40:59.429 --> 03:40:59.439 align:start position:0%
are are working in the field and
 
03:41:01.269 --> 03:41:01.279 align:start position:0%
and they don't have time to devote to
 
03:41:02.870 --> 03:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
constant continued improvement for
 
03:41:04.870 --> 03:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
process improvement
 
03:41:06.309 --> 03:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
so i hope that answers your question
 
03:41:09.030 --> 03:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
03:41:13.110 --> 03:41:13.120 align:start position:0%
collaboration i i think this committee
 
03:41:16.309 --> 03:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
has reference has has
 
03:41:20.070 --> 03:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
certainly manifested a considerable
 
03:41:23.189 --> 03:41:23.199 align:start position:0%
interest in helping the
 
03:41:25.590 --> 03:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
agency to work effectively and
 
03:41:25.600 --> 03:41:27.510 align:start position:0%
agency to work effectively and
efficiently

03:41:27.510 --> 03:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
efficiently
 
03:41:29.910 --> 03:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
but also we've had a lot of concerns
 
03:41:29.920 --> 03:41:30.950 align:start position:0%
but also we've had a lot of concerns
because

03:41:30.950 --> 03:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:41:33.030 --> 03:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
there are a number of this is always
 
03:41:34.790 --> 03:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
although we have a number of new members
 
03:41:37.750 --> 03:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
this time around we also have a majority
 
03:41:39.910 --> 03:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
the committee has been around
 
03:41:41.269 --> 03:41:41.279 align:start position:0%
for quite a while been in the
 
03:41:42.870 --> 03:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
legislature for quite a while been on
 
03:41:44.550 --> 03:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
this committee for quite a while
 
03:41:47.429 --> 03:41:47.439 align:start position:0%
and thus has seen the so-called
 
03:41:47.439 --> 03:41:48.550 align:start position:0%
and thus has seen the so-called
evolution

03:41:48.550 --> 03:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
evolution
 
03:41:51.670 --> 03:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
of the agency from you know the old the
 
03:41:52.710 --> 03:41:52.720 align:start position:0%
old days of the
 
03:41:54.790 --> 03:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
joint board and order mental health
 
03:41:56.870 --> 03:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
practice and all the other boards
 
03:41:59.590 --> 03:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
uh to what we're seeing today and has a
 
03:42:01.189 --> 03:42:01.199 align:start position:0%
lot of concerns but also a lot of
 
03:42:03.030 --> 03:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
dedication to trying
 
03:42:06.630 --> 03:42:06.640 align:start position:0%
and assist uh this entity
 
03:42:10.150 --> 03:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
in functioning uh effectively and
 
03:42:13.670 --> 03:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh so we we i i can speak for myself
 
03:42:16.389 --> 03:42:16.399 align:start position:0%
and i think i can speak for some of my
 
03:42:18.070 --> 03:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
experienced colleagues that we
 
03:42:21.189 --> 03:42:21.199 align:start position:0%
want to be involved in in
 
03:42:24.229 --> 03:42:24.239 align:start position:0%
what what's what comes about here
 
03:42:28.070 --> 03:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh and and to not we don't want to give
 
03:42:29.670 --> 03:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
you blanket authority
 
03:42:34.229 --> 03:42:34.239 align:start position:0%
for things that that that we have not
 
03:42:37.349 --> 03:42:37.359 align:start position:0%
gotten a very good handle on reasons for
 
03:42:37.359 --> 03:42:37.750 align:start position:0%
gotten a very good handle on reasons for
it

03:42:37.750 --> 03:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:42:39.910 --> 03:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
so thank you representatives i'll leave
 
03:42:41.349 --> 03:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
it i'll leave it with that
 
03:42:43.429 --> 03:42:43.439 align:start position:0%
for the moment but we do want to be very
 
03:42:45.030 --> 03:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
closely involved
 
03:42:48.070 --> 03:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative fellows thank
 
03:42:49.510 --> 03:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
03:42:52.870 --> 03:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
um i have two questions the first one is
 
03:42:55.670 --> 03:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
is there a report that will tell us how
 
03:42:55.680 --> 03:42:56.309 align:start position:0%
is there a report that will tell us how
many

03:42:56.309 --> 03:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
many
 
03:43:01.030 --> 03:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
um complaints are filed annually and
 
03:43:03.830 --> 03:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
what those complaints are about the
 
03:43:05.269 --> 03:43:05.279 align:start position:0%
different boards involved
 
03:43:08.229 --> 03:43:08.239 align:start position:0%
and my second question is does the
 
03:43:08.239 --> 03:43:09.110 align:start position:0%
and my second question is does the
public

03:43:09.110 --> 03:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
public
 
03:43:12.229 --> 03:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
and do employers have access to the
 
03:43:14.469 --> 03:43:14.479 align:start position:0%
certification database to check on
 
03:43:17.830 --> 03:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
the status of somebody's credentials
 
03:43:20.070 --> 03:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
yes yes they're both so we have an
 
03:43:22.070 --> 03:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
annual report that's required by statute
 
03:43:23.510 --> 03:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
for us to be completed every
 
03:43:26.150 --> 03:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
november 1. um that's posted on our
 
03:43:27.830 --> 03:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
website and that has a list of the
 
03:43:29.670 --> 03:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
complaints by boards
 
03:43:31.910 --> 03:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
um what i will say though is
 
03:43:33.429 --> 03:43:33.439 align:start position:0%
historically we relied on board
 
03:43:35.030 --> 03:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
administrators who were fielding these
 
03:43:36.630 --> 03:43:36.640 align:start position:0%
these complaints to keep track of the
 
03:43:38.150 --> 03:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
complaints and i don't think it was an
 
03:43:38.160 --> 03:43:39.030 align:start position:0%
complaints and i don't think it was an
accurate

03:43:39.030 --> 03:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
03:43:41.990 --> 03:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
data set and so that has been changed
 
03:43:43.189 --> 03:43:43.199 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
03:43:45.110 --> 03:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
with the consolidation of enforcement
 
03:43:47.269 --> 03:43:47.279 align:start position:0%
efforts in one bureau
 
03:43:49.429 --> 03:43:49.439 align:start position:0%
and what we've seen between september
 
03:43:50.790 --> 03:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:43:53.670 --> 03:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
and uh the end of december we had about
 
03:43:56.070 --> 03:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
650 complaints received which is about
 
03:43:57.990 --> 03:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
double that what was previously reported
 
03:43:58.630 --> 03:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
so i
 
03:44:00.710 --> 03:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
i do not um think that that was an
 
03:44:02.229 --> 03:44:02.239 align:start position:0%
accurate reflection
 
03:44:04.950 --> 03:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
i think in our um our next annual report
 
03:44:06.469 --> 03:44:06.479 align:start position:0%
it'll be about 3 000
 
03:44:09.269 --> 03:44:09.279 align:start position:0%
as my anticipation um with respect to
 
03:44:10.229 --> 03:44:10.239 align:start position:0%
your second question
 
03:44:13.269 --> 03:44:13.279 align:start position:0%
yes we have a licensee look up tool so
 
03:44:15.870 --> 03:44:15.880 align:start position:0%
if you go into i think it's new
 
03:44:15.880 --> 03:44:17.030 align:start position:0%
if you go into i think it's new
newhamsterlicenses.nh.gov

03:44:17.030 --> 03:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
newhamsterlicenses.nh.gov
 
03:44:20.309 --> 03:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
you can type in somebody's name and
 
03:44:21.750 --> 03:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
their credentials should be listed there
 
03:44:23.030 --> 03:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
and if they have any disciplinary
 
03:44:27.750 --> 03:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:30.710 --> 03:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
so just one follow-up if possible follow
 
03:44:30.720 --> 03:44:31.590 align:start position:0%
so just one follow-up if possible follow
up

03:44:31.590 --> 03:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
up
 
03:44:34.550 --> 03:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
thank you um you you mentioned earlier
 
03:44:36.550 --> 03:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
that you thought it was not necessary to
 
03:44:36.560 --> 03:44:37.030 align:start position:0%
that you thought it was not necessary to
have

03:44:37.030 --> 03:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:44:40.070 --> 03:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
photos i i would think that if you're
 
03:44:41.670 --> 03:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
going to have a database where
 
03:44:44.150 --> 03:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
somebody can look up for example to see
 
03:44:45.349 --> 03:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
if a plumber
 
03:44:48.469 --> 03:44:48.479 align:start position:0%
is licensed that it might be useful to
 
03:44:53.990 --> 03:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:57.110 --> 03:44:57.120 align:start position:0%
yeah i think what we've seen with the
 
03:45:00.389 --> 03:45:00.399 align:start position:0%
a question do episode agree um
 
03:45:02.150 --> 03:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
i can see how that might be helpful but
 
03:45:03.429 --> 03:45:03.439 align:start position:0%
one of the other things that i think we
 
03:45:04.950 --> 03:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
need to think about and i'm not married
 
03:45:06.550 --> 03:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
to anything but
 
03:45:09.269 --> 03:45:09.279 align:start position:0%
um we need to think about a privacy and
 
03:45:09.279 --> 03:45:10.150 align:start position:0%
um we need to think about a privacy and
b

03:45:10.150 --> 03:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
b
 
03:45:13.030 --> 03:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
um we need to think about potential bias
 
03:45:13.040 --> 03:45:13.670 align:start position:0%
um we need to think about potential bias
um

03:45:13.670 --> 03:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:15.830 --> 03:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that we've seen
 
03:45:18.229 --> 03:45:18.239 align:start position:0%
with occupational licensing
 
03:45:20.950 --> 03:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
is that when you're using humans using
 
03:45:22.469 --> 03:45:22.479 align:start position:0%
humans to do anything
 
03:45:23.910 --> 03:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
there are opportunities for implicit
 
03:45:25.429 --> 03:45:25.439 align:start position:0%
bias i have personally seen it and i
 
03:45:26.070 --> 03:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
won't comment
 
03:45:28.870 --> 03:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
on particular boards or their operations
 
03:45:30.469 --> 03:45:30.479 align:start position:0%
but so there is a movement
 
03:45:33.750 --> 03:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
nationwide to eliminate those sort of
 
03:45:37.030 --> 03:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
bias subjective requirements
 
03:45:39.750 --> 03:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
and the photograph is one of them the
 
03:45:40.469 --> 03:45:40.479 align:start position:0%
other thing is
 
03:45:41.990 --> 03:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
you know if we're requiring a photograph
 
03:45:43.830 --> 03:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
at every renewal from an efficiency
 
03:45:45.510 --> 03:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
standpoint which we don't presently
 
03:45:47.110 --> 03:45:47.120 align:start position:0%
require photographs that renew we
 
03:45:49.510 --> 03:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
require them at initial licensing only
 
03:45:51.110 --> 03:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
at some point somebody's photograph is
 
03:45:52.830 --> 03:45:52.840 align:start position:0%
going to become completely outdated and
 
03:45:54.870 --> 03:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
useless um so i think those are the
 
03:45:56.150 --> 03:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
things that we need to think about and
 
03:45:57.990 --> 03:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
again i'm not married to anything
 
03:46:00.550 --> 03:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
but i i want the boards to be engaging
 
03:46:02.150 --> 03:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
in this type of analysis this is what
 
03:46:03.830 --> 03:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
i'd like to encourage them to do because
 
03:46:05.670 --> 03:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
just because we've done something for 30
 
03:46:07.349 --> 03:46:07.359 align:start position:0%
years doesn't mean it's the best way to
 
03:46:08.389 --> 03:46:08.399 align:start position:0%
be doing it
 
03:46:10.150 --> 03:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
i think new hampshire can eventually be
 
03:46:11.670 --> 03:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
on the cutting edge of occupational
 
03:46:13.269 --> 03:46:13.279 align:start position:0%
licensing and looking at what do we need
 
03:46:14.309 --> 03:46:14.319 align:start position:0%
really need
 
03:46:15.670 --> 03:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
to ensure minimum standards are
 
03:46:18.469 --> 03:46:18.479 align:start position:0%
satisfied and then what is just extra
 
03:46:20.550 --> 03:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
um that is a barrier to workforce
 
03:46:22.550 --> 03:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
because we have seen that our current
 
03:46:24.389 --> 03:46:24.399 align:start position:0%
licensing structure
 
03:46:25.990 --> 03:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
is in a lot of ways a barrier to
 
03:46:27.910 --> 03:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
workforce entry um we've seen that with
 
03:46:29.030 --> 03:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
03:46:31.349 --> 03:46:31.359 align:start position:0%
um and i think that if you didn't have
 
03:46:32.790 --> 03:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
and now i'm on my soapbox but if you
 
03:46:33.429 --> 03:46:33.439 align:start position:0%
didn't have
 
03:46:35.349 --> 03:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
oplc as an agency we wouldn't for
 
03:46:36.630 --> 03:46:36.640 align:start position:0%
example have been able to do
 
03:46:38.070 --> 03:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
what the state did with regards to
 
03:46:39.510 --> 03:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
emergency licensing it wouldn't have
 
03:46:39.520 --> 03:46:40.630 align:start position:0%
emergency licensing it wouldn't have
happened

03:46:40.630 --> 03:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
happened
 
03:46:43.110 --> 03:46:43.120 align:start position:0%
um and i think that's a benefit that
 
03:46:44.870 --> 03:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
we've seen but we also saw through the
 
03:46:46.950 --> 03:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
emergency licensing process
 
03:46:52.389 --> 03:46:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:57.030 --> 03:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:57.040 --> 03:47:01.269 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:47:01.269 --> 03:47:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:03.110 --> 03:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
this this whole business about a photo
 
03:47:05.590 --> 03:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
here okay if we're trying to verify
 
03:47:08.710 --> 03:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
credentials of someone a photo is
 
03:47:10.790 --> 03:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
is a part of that process we put a photo
 
03:47:12.229 --> 03:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
on a driver's license
 
03:47:14.870 --> 03:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
we put a photo on a passport this is not
 
03:47:16.309 --> 03:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
a social experiment
 
03:47:19.750 --> 03:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
this is a verification process
 
03:47:22.070 --> 03:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
that someone's credentials match the
 
03:47:22.790 --> 03:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
person that
 
03:47:26.630 --> 03:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
you are either trying to bring in or
 
03:47:27.269 --> 03:47:27.279 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
03:47:30.550 --> 03:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
use it's not a privacy issue if i'm
 
03:47:32.790 --> 03:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
trying to verify the credentials
 
03:47:36.550 --> 03:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
of a licensed plumber and i'm doing that
 
03:47:37.510 --> 03:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
let's just say
 
03:47:39.750 --> 03:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
because i'm bringing this plumber into
 
03:47:41.670 --> 03:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
my home to do work
 
03:47:44.950 --> 03:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
that's not a privacy issue hardly this
 
03:47:46.630 --> 03:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
it's a relationship issue for me to
 
03:47:48.389 --> 03:47:48.399 align:start position:0%
verify that i'm
 
03:47:50.070 --> 03:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
bringing someone in that has the
 
03:47:52.309 --> 03:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
credentials that they claim they do
 
03:47:55.990 --> 03:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
so i fully reject the idea that a photo
 
03:47:56.790 --> 03:47:56.800 align:start position:0%
is somehow
 
03:48:00.469 --> 03:48:00.479 align:start position:0%
a problem here as far as updating a
 
03:48:00.479 --> 03:48:01.429 align:start position:0%
a problem here as far as updating a
photo

03:48:01.429 --> 03:48:01.439 align:start position:0%
photo
 
03:48:04.229 --> 03:48:04.239 align:start position:0%
every single one of us have shot a
 
03:48:04.239 --> 03:48:05.189 align:start position:0%
every single one of us have shot a
zillion

03:48:05.189 --> 03:48:05.199 align:start position:0%
zillion
 
03:48:08.229 --> 03:48:08.239 align:start position:0%
very bad photos off of these things okay
 
03:48:10.150 --> 03:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
we've taken more photographs in the last
 
03:48:12.229 --> 03:48:12.239 align:start position:0%
year than the first hundred years of the
 
03:48:12.239 --> 03:48:13.269 align:start position:0%
year than the first hundred years of the
camera

03:48:13.269 --> 03:48:13.279 align:start position:0%
camera
 
03:48:14.870 --> 03:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
so the idea that it would be difficult
 
03:48:16.550 --> 03:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
for someone to update a photo
 
03:48:18.950 --> 03:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
is just is just i don't buy it i mean
 
03:48:20.389 --> 03:48:20.399 align:start position:0%
you can do that with a cell phone in
 
03:48:21.990 --> 03:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
three seconds and
 
03:48:24.389 --> 03:48:24.399 align:start position:0%
you know with the with the push for
 
03:48:26.550 --> 03:48:26.560 align:start position:0%
continued advancements in technology
 
03:48:29.590 --> 03:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
with oplc and you know you talk about
 
03:48:29.600 --> 03:48:29.990 align:start position:0%
with oplc and you know you talk about
bringing

03:48:29.990 --> 03:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
bringing
 
03:48:33.349 --> 03:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
licensing up to a faster level well then
 
03:48:34.870 --> 03:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
certainly a reapplication
 
03:48:36.469 --> 03:48:36.479 align:start position:0%
and the ability to upload a photo should
 
03:48:39.670 --> 03:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:45.750 --> 03:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:47.670 --> 03:48:47.680 align:start position:0%
i mentioned the photo merely as an
 
03:48:48.790 --> 03:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity that i think
 
03:48:50.950 --> 03:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
boards need to engage in and questions
 
03:48:53.189 --> 03:48:53.199 align:start position:0%
about what is actually required
 
03:48:55.750 --> 03:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
i do not believe any state publishes
 
03:48:57.830 --> 03:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
photographs of their licensees i'm a
 
03:48:59.030 --> 03:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
licensed attorney
 
03:49:01.750 --> 03:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
in two states there's not a photograph i
 
03:49:03.269 --> 03:49:03.279 align:start position:0%
think one
 
03:49:05.189 --> 03:49:05.199 align:start position:0%
one way to accomplish that goal right is
 
03:49:06.950 --> 03:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
to ask for a driver's license and look
 
03:49:06.960 --> 03:49:07.189 align:start position:0%
to ask for a driver's license and look
up

03:49:07.189 --> 03:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
up
 
03:49:08.710 --> 03:49:08.720 align:start position:0%
whether or not that's the actual person
 
03:49:10.790 --> 03:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
on the license tool but again i don't
 
03:49:12.710 --> 03:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
want to get sidetracked on whether photo
 
03:49:13.990 --> 03:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
is great whether it's not
 
03:49:15.269 --> 03:49:15.279 align:start position:0%
the point is that the boards are
 
03:49:16.950 --> 03:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
engaging in this analysis which we
 
03:49:18.710 --> 03:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
haven't been doing
 
03:49:21.429 --> 03:49:21.439 align:start position:0%
that was really my intent regarding the
 
03:49:29.830 --> 03:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:34.309 --> 03:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:39.590 --> 03:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
okay i don't see any
 
03:49:41.110 --> 03:49:41.120 align:start position:0%
well thank you all for your time i'm
 
03:49:43.750 --> 03:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
happy to talk offline about anything
 
03:49:45.349 --> 03:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
that i've talked about today
 
03:49:46.790 --> 03:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
and any of our initiatives as we're
 
03:49:48.070 --> 03:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
going forward and certainly the
 
03:49:49.750 --> 03:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
legislation that i'm sure will come
 
03:49:51.510 --> 03:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
before you as well
 
03:49:53.429 --> 03:49:53.439 align:start position:0%
we've got a fair number of bills that
 
03:49:55.349 --> 03:49:55.359 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you'll be involved with
 
03:49:59.590 --> 03:49:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:04.830 --> 03:50:04.840 align:start position:0%
all right so thank you all for attending
 
03:50:04.840 --> 03:50:07.030 align:start position:0%
all right so thank you all for attending
i'm

03:50:07.030 --> 03:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
03:50:09.189 --> 03:50:09.199 align:start position:0%
wish we could have done this in person
 
03:50:11.189 --> 03:50:11.199 align:start position:0%
because it's a lot more informative but
 
03:50:13.750 --> 03:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
under the circumstances i think this is
 
03:50:16.070 --> 03:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
about as good as we're going to get
 
03:50:19.590 --> 03:50:19.600 align:start position:0%
tomorrow there's a briefing from
 
03:50:21.670 --> 03:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
the governor's office or actually i
 
03:50:23.750 --> 03:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
think it's the attorney general
 
03:50:27.830 --> 03:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh on the emergency orders
 
03:50:31.349 --> 03:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
pam could you talk to
 
03:50:35.269 --> 03:50:35.279 align:start position:0%
sure there's a senior associated
 
03:50:37.349 --> 03:50:37.359 align:start position:0%
attorney general jill perlow will be
 
03:50:38.389 --> 03:50:38.399 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
03:50:41.910 --> 03:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
to talk about the the law that
 
03:50:47.670 --> 03:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:50.870 --> 03:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:52.950 --> 03:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
so that we have a number of bills on
 
03:50:54.469 --> 03:50:54.479 align:start position:0%
that this year and it's
 
03:50:57.269 --> 03:50:57.279 align:start position:0%
very topical and after that uh
 
03:50:59.510 --> 03:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt and i will give
 
03:51:02.229 --> 03:51:02.239 align:start position:0%
a 30 000 foot briefing on the
 
03:51:03.910 --> 03:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
administrative rule process
 
03:51:06.710 --> 03:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
that i hope will not take too long i'm
 
03:51:08.710 --> 03:51:08.720 align:start position:0%
trying to schedule hearings for next
 
03:51:09.830 --> 03:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
week but i haven't
 
03:51:12.469 --> 03:51:12.479 align:start position:0%
yet figured out or haven't been informed
 
03:51:13.990 --> 03:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
of what days we can use
 
03:51:17.349 --> 03:51:17.359 align:start position:0%
so i will i will let you know when i
 
03:51:19.030 --> 03:51:19.040 align:start position:0%

who knows when that'll happen and thanks
 
03:51:22.080 --> 03:51:24.550 align:start position:0%
who knows when that'll happen and thanks
again

03:51:24.550 --> 03:51:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:27.590 --> 03:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
any other questions or comments
 
03:51:30.790 --> 03:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
i have a question madam chair surprise
 
03:51:33.990 --> 03:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
schmidt thank you so i've heard
 
03:51:36.229 --> 03:51:36.239 align:start position:0%
an interesting new pronunciation of one
 
03:51:38.150 --> 03:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
of our colleagues names
 
03:51:41.189 --> 03:51:41.199 align:start position:0%
today and i'm wondering if we could have
 
03:51:43.510 --> 03:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
michael tell us how he pronounces his
 
03:51:45.269 --> 03:51:45.279 align:start position:0%
last name because i don't
 
03:51:46.870 --> 03:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
i have been pronouncing it differently
 
03:51:48.950 --> 03:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
than you did and i
 
03:51:52.870 --> 03:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
am very sensitive to linguistic things
 
03:51:55.510 --> 03:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
so i'm wondering if we could have some
 
03:51:57.349 --> 03:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
clarification about how to correctly
 
03:51:57.359 --> 03:51:58.469 align:start position:0%
clarification about how to correctly
pronounce

03:51:58.469 --> 03:51:58.479 align:start position:0%
pronounce
 
03:52:01.189 --> 03:52:01.199 align:start position:0%
pronouns representative what what i
 
03:52:03.030 --> 03:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
thought it was yakubovic but
 
03:52:06.870 --> 03:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
who knows you got it
 
03:52:10.710 --> 03:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
that's correct okay
 
03:52:13.189 --> 03:52:13.199 align:start position:0%
i will i will attempt to maintain that
 
03:52:14.630 --> 03:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:52:16.790 --> 03:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
yes and if anyone else if i mangle your
 
03:52:17.830 --> 03:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
name which i
 
03:52:21.110 --> 03:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
i tend to do please catch me before it
 
03:52:23.429 --> 03:52:23.439 align:start position:0%
goes on for 15 years like representative
 
03:52:25.110 --> 03:52:25.120 align:start position:0%
lekas did
 
03:52:28.229 --> 03:52:28.239 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for correcting that tool
 
03:52:31.269 --> 03:52:31.279 align:start position:0%
tony yeah i think um
 
03:52:33.030 --> 03:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
i don't remember what happened 15 years
 
03:52:35.349 --> 03:52:35.359 align:start position:0%
ago i suspect once or twice or maybe i'm
 
03:52:36.550 --> 03:52:36.560 align:start position:0%
misremembering i
 
03:52:38.469 --> 03:52:38.479 align:start position:0%
corrected it but usually i then give up
 
03:52:39.590 --> 03:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
so and maybe i'm
 
03:52:42.710 --> 03:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
i was remembering someone else so uh
 
03:52:44.309 --> 03:52:44.319 align:start position:0%
apologize for not doing it earlier
 
03:52:45.830 --> 03:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
actually while we're on that topic
 
03:52:49.510 --> 03:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
um uh i won't try the last name but
 
03:52:51.990 --> 03:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
um matthew if you could say your name
 
03:52:56.870 --> 03:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:00.070 --> 03:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
okay please yeah to be honest uh to be
 
03:53:01.269 --> 03:53:01.279 align:start position:0%
honest i don't even know if i know how
 
03:53:03.110 --> 03:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
to say it since i'm a
 
03:53:05.030 --> 03:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
third generation american at this point
 
03:53:06.389 --> 03:53:06.399 align:start position:0%
but i've been saying uh
 
03:53:14.389 --> 03:53:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:17.429 --> 03:53:17.439 align:start position:0%
we will all try to use that because no
 
03:53:19.269 --> 03:53:19.279 align:start position:0%
matter if it's right or wrong for your
 
03:53:20.790 --> 03:53:20.800 align:start position:0%
