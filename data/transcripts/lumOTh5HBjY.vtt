bill 1022 we're not going to necessarily
 
00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
be taking them in numerical order
 
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
um a few people have asked if we could
 
00:07:31.029 --> 00:07:31.039 align:start position:0%
hold a bill that is special to them
 
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:33.520 align:start position:0%

until tomorrow and
i've

00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
i've
 
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
so far been happy to exceed to that so
 
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
we are actually going to start with the
 
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
top of the list 10 22 permitting
 
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
pharmacists to dispense the drug
 
00:07:48.309 --> 00:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
ivermectin by means of a standing order
 
00:07:50.029 --> 00:07:50.039 align:start position:0%
and the chair
 
00:07:50.039 --> 00:07:51.589 align:start position:0%
and the chair
recognizes

00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
recognizes
 
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
representative cushman because there is
 
00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and i'm passing
 
00:08:01.029 --> 00:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
the amendment around right now it's 20
 
00:08:07.189 --> 00:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
and i brought down many of the amendment
 
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh groups from the fourth floor and just
 
00:08:14.869 --> 00:08:14.879 align:start position:0%
ask you not hand them out until the bill
 
00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
is called or we're going to drown in
 
00:08:16.319 --> 00:08:17.670 align:start position:0%
is called or we're going to drown in
paper

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
paper
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
more than we usually do
 
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:22.720 align:start position:0%
so this amendment that's coming around
 
00:08:24.309 --> 00:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
it does address some of the concerns
 
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
that were raised in the work group
 
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
on this bipartisan work group although
 
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
we could not reach a consensus in the
 
00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:33.919 align:start position:0%
work group
 
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
after several meetings
 
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
but it addresses the concerns that were
 
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.350 align:start position:0%
but it addresses the concerns that were
raised

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
raised
 
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
it it indicates that they have to
 
00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
specify a screening protocol for each
 
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
patient a requirement to document the
 
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
screening performed and the prescription
 
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
in the patient's medical record
 
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
including a plan for referring for an
 
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
evaluation and treatment if adverse
 
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
effect events occur
 
00:08:59.110 --> 00:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
it also removed the line that
 
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
nothing on the information sheet shall
 
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
discourage the use of ivermectin for the
 
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
treatment of covet 19 because if
 
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
ivermectin is a versatile drug and it's
 
00:09:13.509 --> 00:09:13.519 align:start position:0%
it's got many uses so if if a physician
 
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
in a pharmacy
 
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
um want to enter into a standing order
 
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
agreement like this
 
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
to make ivermectin available for
 
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
treating parasites such as scabies and
 
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
not not
 
00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
specifically for covet 19 then they
 
00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:29.519 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't have to
 
00:09:31.269 --> 00:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
not discourage if they feel that that's
 
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
how would the amendment differ from the
 
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
bill as originally filed
 
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so in it's mostly
 
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.509 align:start position:0%
yeah so in it's mostly
um

00:09:43.509 --> 00:09:43.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:43.519 --> 00:09:45.750 align:start position:0%
um
in

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
lines nine and sorry not lines
 
00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.150 align:start position:0%
lines nine and sorry not lines
11

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
11
 
00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
and 12 just some slightly changed
 
00:09:55.269 --> 00:09:55.279 align:start position:0%
wording just to make it clear what needs
 
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.230 align:start position:0%
to be
included

00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:58.240 align:start position:0%
included
 
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
again the screening performed and a plan
 
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
for referring for evaluation and
 
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
treatment of adverse events and then
 
00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:08.870 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:11.829 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:10:11.829 --> 00:10:11.839 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:30.949 --> 00:10:30.959 align:start position:0%
it also um
 
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
places the statements that the board of
 
00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:33.990 align:start position:0%
places the statements that the board of
medicine

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
medicine
 
00:10:35.829 --> 00:10:35.839 align:start position:0%
shall not deny revoke or suspend or
 
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
otherwise take disciplinary action
 
00:10:38.949 --> 00:10:38.959 align:start position:0%
against a physician based on a
 
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
physician's failure to follow a standing
 
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
order provided
 
00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
that were provided
 
00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:47.839 align:start position:0%
using the provisions of this section
 
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
puts that into the statutes governing
 
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
the board of medicine
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
and likewise with the
 
00:10:59.269 --> 00:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
advanced practice registered nurses
 
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
and the pharmacy pharmacists that just
 
00:11:02.949 --> 00:11:02.959 align:start position:0%
put the puts those into the appropriate
 
00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
statutes as well instead of having it
 
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
only be um
 
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
so it's actually the three new sections
 
00:11:16.949 --> 00:11:16.959 align:start position:0%
at the end
 
00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
and it also includes that the
 
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
information sheet that they give out so
 
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
this is section 5 of the bill starts on
 
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
line 25 the pharmacist shall provide
 
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
each recipient
 
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
with an information sheet written in
 
00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
plain language which shall include but
 
00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
is not limited to potential adverse
 
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
effects drug interactions food and drug
 
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
administration approved indications for
 
00:11:46.949 --> 00:11:46.959 align:start position:0%
ivermectin use the importance of
 
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up care and healthcare referral
 
00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:52.389 align:start position:0%
follow-up care and healthcare referral
information

00:11:52.389 --> 00:11:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
so really the main the important piece
 
00:11:59.030 --> 00:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
something of note is the indications for
 
00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
ivermectin use so they are informed that
 
00:12:09.269 --> 00:12:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
any questions for the representative
 
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:16.389 --> 00:12:16.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman also thank you
 
00:12:17.829 --> 00:12:17.839 align:start position:0%
represent cushman for taking the
 
00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:20.959 align:start position:0%
question or just responding to it
 
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
i want to commend you for trying to make
 
00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
some changes to it unfortunately i don't
 
00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
think it fits what we're trying to get
 
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
to at least from a pharmacist's point of
 
00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:28.790 align:start position:0%
to at least from a pharmacist's point of
view

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
view
 
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
a standing order is different than a
 
00:12:31.509 --> 00:12:31.519 align:start position:0%
collaborative agreement the way this is
 
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
written an agreement is between a
 
00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
provider and a pharmacist which spells
 
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
out exactly what it is which is what a
 
00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
collaborative agreement's all about
 
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
standing order on the other hand is
 
00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:40.949 align:start position:0%
standing order on the other hand is
really

00:12:40.949 --> 00:12:40.959 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
authorization for the pharmacists to
 
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
follow protocol
 
00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
and that's broadly used so without
 
00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:47.519 align:start position:0%
having the underlying
 
00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
protocol that we all can agree to and
 
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:50.720 align:start position:0%
vetted correctly
 
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know how we can use a standing
 
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
order as a pharmacist
 
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
so therefore
 
00:12:56.949 --> 00:12:56.959 align:start position:0%
we're trying to take a collaborative
 
00:12:59.430 --> 00:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
agreement approach and apply it to a
 
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
standing order approach and the two of
 
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
them don't fundamentally work that way
 
00:13:07.509 --> 00:13:07.519 align:start position:0%
so that's why when i look at this bill
 
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
overall even though the drug may be safe
 
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
it still needs to have some sort of
 
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
guidelines for the pharmacist to follow
 
00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:15.200 align:start position:0%
that have been vetted and built on
 
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
consensus so we did the same thing with
 
00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:18.959 align:start position:0%
nicotine with hormonal contraceptive
 
00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
therapy the process who went through to
 
00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
develop the protocol plus the
 
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
forms used to give to the patient were
 
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
fully vetted between all three
 
00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:29.750 align:start position:0%
fully vetted between all three
disciplines

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
disciplines
 
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
and it took time but it was at the end
 
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
of the day the appropriate thing to do
 
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
so without having that process in place
 
00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
to get to us
 
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
through consensus
 
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.269 align:start position:0%
through consensus
protocol

00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
protocol
 
00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
and agreement upon what the standard
 
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
form is going to say i could not support
 
00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.189 align:start position:0%
form is going to say i could not support
this

00:13:47.189 --> 00:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
question of the chair for the
 
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
representative if there was were a um
 
00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:56.240 align:start position:0%
a tweak to the amendment
 
00:13:59.110 --> 00:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
that deals with the uh terminological
 
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:02.720 align:start position:0%
problem would that be sufficient for you
 
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:04.720 align:start position:0%
no it would not mr chairman the reason
 
00:14:06.629 --> 00:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
for it being is the key to it is the
 
00:14:06.639 --> 00:14:07.750 align:start position:0%
for it being is the key to it is the
protocol

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
protocol
 
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
until we have an agreement amongst the
 
00:14:11.189 --> 00:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
professions amongst the disciplines of
 
00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
what that protocol is
 
00:14:14.949 --> 00:14:14.959 align:start position:0%
i think we're putting pharmacists into
 
00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
crosshairs with liability because if
 
00:14:20.069 --> 00:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
something happens heaven forbid it does
 
00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
and that protocol has not been vetted
 
00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.110 align:start position:0%
and that protocol has not been vetted
appropriately

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
then i think we're opening up the
 
00:14:26.389 --> 00:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
pharmacist to a lot of liability that
 
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
they may not understand
 
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
or may be pushed into taken if you
 
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
action which should not be in their best
 
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
interest i still go back to the issue
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
about the protocol
 
00:14:38.949 --> 00:14:38.959 align:start position:0%
thank you and since this is an exact
 
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
session it is not necessary to
 
00:14:43.829 --> 00:14:43.839 align:start position:0%
ask a question not that we usually do
 
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
anyway but um
 
00:14:48.069 --> 00:14:48.079 align:start position:0%
we definitely don't have to hear anyone
 
00:14:51.189 --> 00:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
with any anything you wish to share or
 
00:14:54.069 --> 00:14:54.079 align:start position:0%
ask of the amendment sponsor
 
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
representative knurk actually mine is a
 
00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
question um
 
00:15:00.389 --> 00:15:00.399 align:start position:0%
just a little confused on page one of
 
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
the amendment i'm sorry of the uh
 
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
here we are lines 29 to 31 let's say
 
00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
talks about the board of medicine shall
 
00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
not blah blah blah that's on page one
 
00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.350 align:start position:0%
not blah blah blah that's on page one
29-31

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
29-31
 
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
and then we have the new section over on
 
00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
page two
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
that is lines seven through nine i'm
 
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
trying to understand why does that need
 
00:15:22.629 --> 00:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
to be in both places could you just
 
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
clarify that for me sure so the statute
 
00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at is in the pharmacy
 
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.430 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at is in the pharmacy
statutes

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.310 align:start position:0%
statutes
so

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:34.069 --> 00:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
um and it's not specifically under
 
00:15:34.079 --> 00:15:37.590 align:start position:0%
um and it's not specifically under
um

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not specifically under
 
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
like the licensing so we just needed to
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
put it in the nursing and the physician
 
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
licensing statute so there's no
 
00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:51.990 align:start position:0%
licensing statute so there's no
question

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
representative merchant thank you the
 
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
other thing which i'll bring to people's
 
00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
attention here about the issue of a
 
00:15:59.910 --> 00:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
standing order
 
00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
when we have used standing orders in the
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
past what's included in there is a
 
00:16:06.069 --> 00:16:06.079 align:start position:0%
requirement for continuing education to
 
00:16:07.829 --> 00:16:07.839 align:start position:0%
be sure the pharmacist is educated
 
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
appropriately to follow the protocol
 
00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
that's not in here
 
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
and i think goes back to my initial
 
00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:16.720 align:start position:0%
concern is that we have a protocol
 
00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
that's really not been vetted correctly
 
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
and we also have not identified how the
 
00:16:22.389 --> 00:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
pharmacist should be trained to use the
 
00:16:24.949 --> 00:16:24.959 align:start position:0%
protocol so those two things taken
 
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
together i think makes this bill
 
00:16:31.749 --> 00:16:31.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:34.629 --> 00:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
representative folsom
 
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not really sure who would have the
 
00:16:38.949 --> 00:16:38.959 align:start position:0%
answer to this but can't the protocols
 
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
and the process of education be hammered
 
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
out in the rules process
 
00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
representative merchant
 
00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
it could be unfortunately there's no
 
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
requirement for it to be done
 
00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.509 align:start position:0%
requirement for it to be done
so

00:16:53.509 --> 00:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:16:55.829 --> 00:16:55.839 align:start position:0%
and right so you can't do that unless
 
00:16:57.749 --> 00:16:57.759 align:start position:0%
the statute requires it and at that
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
point in time the statute does not
 
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
require it um if we went through rule
 
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
making process and had the boards like
 
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
we did with the other standing orders
 
00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:06.959 align:start position:0%
vet things appropriately we could do
 
00:17:08.549 --> 00:17:08.559 align:start position:0%
that but right now that's not a
 
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
requirement in this amendment nor in the
 
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.549 align:start position:0%
requirement in this amendment nor in the
bill

00:17:12.549 --> 00:17:12.559 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
i'm going to take a step backwards and
 
00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
rather than wordsmithing just say that
 
00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
we've already passed a bill
 
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
that clarifies that off-label use
 
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
is appropriate when a
 
00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:34.870 align:start position:0%
is appropriate when a
provider

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
provider
 
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
and a patient have had an appropriate
 
00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
conversation about the medicine and its
 
00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.270 align:start position:0%
conversation about the medicine and its
use

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
use
 
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
we strengthened the protections for
 
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
people using off-label use and clarified
 
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
that they were very appropriate so i
 
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
think that's the way to go and i'm
 
00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely opposed to this approach as a
 
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
matter of policy thank you
 
00:17:57.029 --> 00:17:57.039 align:start position:0%
representative cushman thank you mr
 
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
chairman so i have several points
 
00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:01.430 align:start position:0%
chairman so i have several points
so

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
i understand what you're saying about a
 
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
collaborative agreement representative
 
00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:06.720 align:start position:0%
merchant but that requires a prior
 
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
relationship with the patient in all
 
00:18:11.909 --> 00:18:11.919 align:start position:0%
scenarios this drug is available in
 
00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
many countries over the counter with no
 
00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:17.039 align:start position:0%
protocols required it is incredibly safe
 
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
the patient could dose themselves how
 
00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
they see fit so this would ensure that
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
there's an agreement between a physician
 
00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
who's familiar with protocols that are
 
00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
effective for what they want to treat to
 
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
issue that order and then give the
 
00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
prescribing authority to the pharmacist
 
00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
through dispensa through his ability to
 
00:18:39.029 --> 00:18:39.039 align:start position:0%
his or her ability to dispense it
 
00:18:39.039 --> 00:18:40.150 align:start position:0%
his or her ability to dispense it
um

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
you know this is something that is
 
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
is needed quickly that's why i didn't
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
leave it up to rules uh well it was
 
00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
needed quickly and we don't know what
 
00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
the fall is going to bring
 
00:18:54.549 --> 00:18:54.559 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the numbers have decreased
 
00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
significantly but the problem with
 
00:18:58.710 --> 00:18:58.720 align:start position:0%
establishing relationship with these
 
00:19:00.549 --> 00:19:00.559 align:start position:0%
doctors ahead of time and we've had this
 
00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
discussion is that they're hard to find
 
00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:03.830 align:start position:0%
discussion is that they're hard to find
um

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
as far as liability
 
00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
that's up to the pharmacist this doesn't
 
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
require any pharmacy or pharmacists to
 
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
enter into this kind of agreement it
 
00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
just permits if there is a
 
00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:16.799 align:start position:0%
a small pharmacy somewhere in the state
 
00:19:19.029 --> 00:19:19.039 align:start position:0%
who wants to enter into this agreement
 
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
with a physician who's familiar with the
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
protocol and can write it and issue it
 
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
and they enter into this together then
 
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
whoever goes to that pharmacy can ask
 
00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
representative leon thank you mr
 
00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:35.750 align:start position:0%
representative leon thank you mr
chairman

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
i think what this ultimately comes down
 
00:19:39.909 --> 00:19:39.919 align:start position:0%
to is harm reduction right now people
 
00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
are getting ivermectin from india from
 
00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:44.720 align:start position:0%
mexico on spring break in the dominican
 
00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:45.990 align:start position:0%
mexico on spring break in the dominican
republic

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
republic
 
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
and also getting it from the the pet
 
00:19:51.669 --> 00:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
store the farm stores
 
00:19:53.669 --> 00:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
people are seeking it out and i would
 
00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
prefer that people have available
 
00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
ivermectin that's been manufactured in
 
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
fda compliant fda inspected facilities
 
00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
i understand this doesn't meet all the
 
00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
same same requirements that hormonal
 
00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:10.720 align:start position:0%
contraception which is very dangerous
 
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
important but dangerous and tobacco
 
00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
cessation and nicotine therapy that also
 
00:20:18.149 --> 00:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
has significantly higher risks i
 
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
understand it doesn't hit all those
 
00:20:22.549 --> 00:20:22.559 align:start position:0%
other metrics but people are using it
 
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
using one that is adulterated with
 
00:20:26.149 --> 00:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
another substance because they're only
 
00:20:28.149 --> 00:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
looking for ivermectin and not the other
 
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
things that are in the horse medicines
 
00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
is dangerous and by doing this and
 
00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
allowing those select pharmacies and
 
00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
providers who do want to enter into this
 
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to do so so that fda
 
00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
manufactured ivermectin is available i
 
00:20:47.029 --> 00:20:47.039 align:start position:0%
believe is a benefit to our people and
 
00:20:50.789 --> 00:20:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm troubled
 
00:20:59.510 --> 00:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
we as representative weber pointed out
 
00:21:01.029 --> 00:21:01.039 align:start position:0%
we already have
 
00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
one bill that i think places it in the
 
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
proper position of having the physician
 
00:21:07.029 --> 00:21:07.039 align:start position:0%
and the patient understand that this is
 
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
an off-label use and i think that's the
 
00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate place
 
00:21:11.909 --> 00:21:11.919 align:start position:0%
i don't think the legislature should be
 
00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
practicing medicine
 
00:21:16.789 --> 00:21:16.799 align:start position:0%
which is really basically what this is
 
00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
we've done that before
 
00:21:21.909 --> 00:21:21.919 align:start position:0%
you may recall that there was a
 
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
loud hue and cry
 
00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
to have bone marrow transplants for
 
00:21:27.669 --> 00:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
breast cancer
 
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
huge human cry and this legislature went
 
00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
through the process of mandating
 
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
well guess what
 
00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
within six months it was found it would
 
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
be not only inappropriate but perhaps
 
00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.990 align:start position:0%
be not only inappropriate but perhaps
dangerous

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:48.149 --> 00:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
we don't want to go down that path
 
00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
another example lay a trill hue and cry
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
about all the kids were being wasted
 
00:21:58.390 --> 00:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
because this government would not allow
 
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
turns out it was not as effective and it
 
00:22:12.149 --> 00:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
was also dangerous
 
00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
there is a human cry with covid
 
00:22:16.789 --> 00:22:16.799 align:start position:0%
i will not
 
00:22:16.799 --> 00:22:17.990 align:start position:0%
i will not
take

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
take
 
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
the vaccine
 
00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
it's not fda approved no that's just
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
emergency that is not fully fda approved
 
00:22:27.909 --> 00:22:27.919 align:start position:0%
yeah here we're
 
00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
trying to legislate something that
 
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:40.470 align:start position:0%
 
giving

00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
giving
 
00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:42.390 align:start position:0%
giving
a

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
standing order gives it the imprimatur
 
00:22:49.029 --> 00:22:49.039 align:start position:0%
that this is really fully fully approved
 
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
by the fda
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
if you look on clinical trials
 
00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
there are some that say it should be
 
00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
the recent articles in the and the
 
00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
journal medical
 
00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
american medical association
 
00:23:05.669 --> 00:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
new england journal of medicine say we
 
00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
need some state looks like it could be
 
00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
okay but the originals the studies we've
 
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:10.950 align:start position:0%
okay but the originals the studies we've
done

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:23:11.909 --> 00:23:11.919 align:start position:0%
in those
 
00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
that have just been recently reported
 
00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
say it doesn't indicate that this is
 
00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.070 align:start position:0%
say it doesn't indicate that this is
really

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:23:19.029 --> 00:23:19.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
so we have to be a little bit careful
 
00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
what we're doing of practicing medicine
 
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
in this way
 
00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
and for those reasons
 
00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
i will have to vote against it
 
00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
the chair asks representative cushman to
 
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
follow up on representative woods with
 
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
that off label bill that we've passed
 
00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
does that make your bill not needed in
 
00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
your opinion
 
00:23:46.789 --> 00:23:46.799 align:start position:0%
in my opinion no it doesn't
 
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
we still have patients who don't know
 
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
where to find the doctors who will write
 
00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
the prescription for ivermectin um and
 
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
if they know that there's a pharmacy
 
00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
that they can just go to
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
it makes it much easier for them than to
 
00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
go to a you know
 
00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
it's more convenient than having to
 
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
go and find this doctor and set up an
 
00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:07.190 align:start position:0%
go and find this doctor and set up an
appointment

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
appointment
 
00:24:08.789 --> 00:24:08.799 align:start position:0%
but it's safer than going to the farm
 
00:24:08.799 --> 00:24:10.470 align:start position:0%
but it's safer than going to the farm
store

00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
store
 
00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
if i know
 
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
that most pharmacies today
 
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
because of the politics behind us
 
00:24:23.269 --> 00:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
will not stock the drug
 
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
therefore even if we have a standing
 
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
order we pass this
 
00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:28.789 align:start position:0%
order we pass this
the

00:24:28.789 --> 00:24:28.799 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:24:30.549 --> 00:24:30.559 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a patient to go to a
 
00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
local pharmacy to obtain the medication
 
00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
which is the intent behind this becomes
 
00:24:37.029 --> 00:24:37.039 align:start position:0%
null and void
 
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
so in essence i go back to what
 
00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
representative weber said and also
 
00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
represented wood i think the way to
 
00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:44.240 align:start position:0%
approach this because both bills are
 
00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
going to come through the state house
 
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
into the senate at about the same time
 
00:24:50.789 --> 00:24:50.799 align:start position:0%
is to use the off-label use
 
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
at this point in time for people to be
 
00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
aware of it a pharmacist in the state of
 
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire can dispense a medication
 
00:24:59.510 --> 00:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
from any licensed provider licensed by a
 
00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
state in any state in this country
 
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
they can do it through telehealth
 
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
there's ways for them today
 
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
to have access to ivermectin and use the
 
00:25:09.669 --> 00:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
system we have in place and not have it
 
00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:10.799 align:start position:0%
slowed down
 
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
but getting this bill through in a
 
00:25:15.269 --> 00:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
standing order does not mean that the
 
00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
pharmacies and the pharmacists are going
 
00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
to dispense it because
 
00:25:21.029 --> 00:25:21.039 align:start position:0%
most of them probably are not going to
 
00:25:23.029 --> 00:25:23.039 align:start position:0%
stock it
 
00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
representative canarch
 
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
thank you and i wanted to just reflect a
 
00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
bit on what representative woods said he
 
00:25:31.269 --> 00:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
gave a nice historical
 
00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
viewpoint of things and i think that's
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
helpful but
 
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
keeping it into the more recent time i
 
00:25:37.269 --> 00:25:37.279 align:start position:0%
know that there were many comments made
 
00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
in this committee at various points
 
00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
about that there's this huge number of
 
00:25:43.269 --> 00:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
studies on ivermectin that shows it's
 
00:25:43.279 --> 00:25:44.470 align:start position:0%
studies on ivermectin that shows it's
effective

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
effective
 
00:25:46.549 --> 00:25:46.559 align:start position:0%
in my testimony when i testified about
 
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
this i went over the issues of how we
 
00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:49.350 align:start position:0%
this i went over the issues of how we
quali

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
quali
 
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
judge the quality of the study
 
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
so we know whether or not a study is
 
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
actually valid
 
00:25:58.870 --> 00:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
and that is not an issue of censoring or
 
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
not liking a point of view it is simply
 
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
the way we've done it now for the last
 
00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
few decades in terms of looking to see
 
00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
study design i don't know if any of you
 
00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
took time to look at the couple of
 
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
studies sent out by the new hampshire
 
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
medical society it was under james
 
00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
potter's name about three or four days
 
00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:14.390 align:start position:0%
potter's name about three or four days
ago

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
ago
 
00:26:15.669 --> 00:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
but that's an example of the big
 
00:26:17.669 --> 00:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
difference the sponsor distributed at
 
00:26:19.269 --> 00:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
the time of the hearing
 
00:26:20.789 --> 00:26:20.799 align:start position:0%
a paper
 
00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
on 233 000 subjects sounds wonderful
 
00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of people
 
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
but the way that people entered the
 
00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:28.400 align:start position:0%
study is they were invited to come in if
 
00:26:31.269 --> 00:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
they wish to do so and take the drug um
 
00:26:31.279 --> 00:26:32.230 align:start position:0%
they wish to do so and take the drug um
so

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
they if they walked in and they said hey
 
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
i'd like to do this then they were given
 
00:26:36.789 --> 00:26:36.799 align:start position:0%
the drug
 
00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
no randomization if you look at the two
 
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
articles that were sent
 
00:26:41.669 --> 00:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
by potter
 
00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
that's a standard
 
00:26:45.669 --> 00:26:45.679 align:start position:0%
real proper study where you went to a
 
00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
database from one of them to draw people
 
00:26:48.789 --> 00:26:48.799 align:start position:0%
who were under treatment the other is
 
00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:50.720 align:start position:0%
everybody admitted to the hospital they
 
00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
were invited to join the study but then
 
00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
they were randomized using computer
 
00:26:56.549 --> 00:26:56.559 align:start position:0%
randomization it's not even just a
 
00:26:58.950 --> 00:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
person assigning them it's all computer
 
00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
number generated to make sure that it's
 
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
a true randomized and prospective study
 
00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
the distribution the study distributed
 
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
at the time of the hearing is not
 
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
and if we look at these studies because
 
00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:13.919 align:start position:0%
i've reviewed dozens of them most of
 
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
them are just very poor quality
 
00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
again as i
 
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
stressed getting away from the politics
 
00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
of this country
 
00:27:22.389 --> 00:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
the cochrane collaboration which is
 
00:27:23.909 --> 00:27:23.919 align:start position:0%
international consortium that i've
 
00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
relied on for
 
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
good quality studies for decades
 
00:27:30.149 --> 00:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
have also looked at it and again they
 
00:27:31.669 --> 00:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
don't find negative but they simply
 
00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
don't find any supporting evidence from
 
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
studies that are quality studies and
 
00:27:37.669 --> 00:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
that's where they still are ongoing so i
 
00:27:39.029 --> 00:27:39.039 align:start position:0%
agree that we should be not giving them
 
00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
premature that this is actually
 
00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:43.919 align:start position:0%
an accepted treatment because it isn't
 
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
and that's probably why people have a
 
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
hard time finding doctors who will
 
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
prescribe it is because the majority of
 
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
doctors follow
 
00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
the actual
 
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
data with the best data we have
 
00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
and that's an important thing that we
 
00:27:59.669 --> 00:27:59.679 align:start position:0%
continue to do if somebody wishes to
 
00:28:03.029 --> 00:28:03.039 align:start position:0%
prescribe it off label again we have
 
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
that authority over the under under the
 
00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
other bill that we already passed
 
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
and i think that should be sufficient
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
and also online i understand people can
 
00:28:15.669 --> 00:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
go to flccc online and go ahead and get
 
00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
get information
 
00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
and get a prescription as well so thank
 
00:28:22.389 --> 00:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
you representative and would remind us
 
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
we have 23 bills and we are still
 
00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
debating the amendment on the first one
 
00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
i would not wish to think we're being
 
00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
dilatory i if you have an original
 
00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
thought that has not been stated i would
 
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
encourage you to put your hand up if
 
00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
you're going to rehash what has been
 
00:28:42.789 --> 00:28:42.799 align:start position:0%
said on both sides we have 23 bills
 
00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
does anyone wish to speak further
 
00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:47.840 align:start position:0%

you have been sent
 
00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
a copy of the amendment

by email but here is hard copy now
 
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
coming around to you and i'll

let you have a chance
to

00:33:22.149 --> 00:33:22.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:33:25.029 --> 00:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
look at it
 
00:33:25.039 --> 00:33:54.389 align:start position:0%
look at it
again

00:33:54.389 --> 00:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:21.750 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:25.109 --> 00:34:25.119 align:start position:0%
and for the record under house bill 1022
 
00:34:29.829 --> 00:34:29.839 align:start position:0%
412 people signed in in support and 327
 
00:34:32.829 --> 00:34:32.839 align:start position:0%
signed in in opposition and i'd remind
 
00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:35.919 align:start position:0%
people in the opinion of many these
 
00:34:38.629 --> 00:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
numbers are at least a bit squiffy it
 
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
has to do and i say that about bills
 
00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:41.510 align:start position:0%
has to do and i say that about bills
where

00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
way more people signed in for me than
 
00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
against me because it just means
 
00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:47.919 align:start position:0%
somebody managed to get out the emailers
 
00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
and if there's an amendment
 
00:34:52.629 --> 00:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
remember these sign in and sign in
 
00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:53.750 align:start position:0%
remember these sign in and sign in
against

00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
against
 
00:34:55.109 --> 00:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
are for the original bill not the
 
00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
amended bill so anyway
 
00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes himself to speak to
 
00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
our house committees
 
00:35:09.109 --> 00:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
are sometimes presented with a bill
 
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
asking for something to be put into law
 
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
in response we often hear someone say
 
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
the bill is unnecessary
 
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
because the subject is
 
00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
already covered
 
00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
in the law
 
00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
and we can debate whether that's true or
 
00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
not adequately speaking
 
00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
but much of the time i find myself in
 
00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
sympathy with those who
 
00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure
 
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
whether the facts
 
00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
of whether it's covered in the law are
 
00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
there or not
 
00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
i recognize that there's
 
00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
concern and maybe even fear
 
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
and for me that's also a real thing
 
00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
when conversion therapy was previously
 
00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
debated no one could cite an example of
 
00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
a licensed professional in medicine or
 
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
counseling using shock treatment or
 
00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
locking somebody in a closet or
 
00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
subjecting someone to pornography
 
00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
but irrespective of that the fact
 
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
remains that some tender aged people
 
00:36:07.349 --> 00:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
might be counseled
 
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
dare we say pressured or forced
 
00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
to become something that is against
 
00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
their will
 
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
even if it's the will of their parents
 
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
i understand the proper function of
 
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
professional counseling is to be client
 
00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:24.470 align:start position:0%
professional counseling is to be client
directed

00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
directed
 
00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
so i honor the concern raised
 
00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
as i honor
 
00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
the fear expressed
 
00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
however i also know of tender age
 
00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
persons who are experiencing same-sex
 
00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
attractions they do not wish to have
 
00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
and want professional help to work
 
00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:41.990 align:start position:0%
and want professional help to work
through

00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:36:44.069 --> 00:36:44.079 align:start position:0%
those feelings
 
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
i've spoken with professionals who have
 
00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
told me they're afraid
 
00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
of having sanctions brought against them
 
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
for offering services to this group of
 
00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:54.550 align:start position:0%
for offering services to this group of
clients

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
clients
 
00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
some have told me that their fear
 
00:36:59.270 --> 00:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
is unrealistic because the law doesn't
 
00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
read that way
 
00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
again that's debatable
 
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
and whether this is true or not i
 
00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
recognize the fear that is present
 
00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:09.270 align:start position:0%
recognize the fear that is present
here

00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:37:13.349 --> 00:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
for me that fear is a real thing as well
 
00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
so i wish to honor
 
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
the fear
 
00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:18.640 align:start position:0%
the concern
 
00:37:21.109 --> 00:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
i wish to honor what i believe is the
 
00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate use of counseling that it is
 
00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
client centered
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
and that counseling is
 
00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
not forced
 
00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
on the client
 
00:37:33.829 --> 00:37:33.839 align:start position:0%
by professionals
 
00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
in addition this amendment says that
 
00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
across the board professional services
 
00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
should be client determined
 
00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:41.839 align:start position:0%
and as i was working on this amendment i
 
00:37:43.829 --> 00:37:43.839 align:start position:0%
wondered why the people who were
 
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned were just those under 18.
 
00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
how about 19 year olds should they not
 
00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:52.150 align:start position:0%
how about 19 year olds should they not
be

00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:53.670 align:start position:0%
be
free

00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
free
 
00:37:55.829 --> 00:37:55.839 align:start position:0%
from having counseling
 
00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
forced on them
 
00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
or 20 year olds
 
00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
be able to have counseling the intent of
 
00:38:11.109 --> 00:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
what this person wants
 
00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
shouldn't this be true straight across
 
00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
the board
 
00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
no forced
 
00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:19.349 align:start position:0%
no forced
counseling

00:38:19.349 --> 00:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
counseling
 
00:38:19.359 --> 00:38:20.630 align:start position:0%
counseling
and

protections
 
00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
so that is my amendment
 
00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:27.190 align:start position:0%
so that is my amendment
and

00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:27.200 align:start position:0%

discussion for questions representative
 
00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:35.349 align:start position:0%
discussion for questions representative
merchant

00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
i want to commend you for taking the
 
00:38:39.349 --> 00:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
stab at doing this
 
00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
however i do concern myself against
 
00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.109 align:start position:0%
however i do concern myself against
anyone's

00:38:43.109 --> 00:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
anyone's
 
00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
will particularly a minor
 
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
i know growing up as a child
 
00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
my parents were
 
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
gospel they were
 
00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
you never questioned my
 
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
family my
 
00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
support system and so forth it wasn't
 
00:38:58.790 --> 00:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
because they were hard on me just
 
00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
because their acceptance of me was so
 
00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:03.349 align:start position:0%
because their acceptance of me was so
critical

00:39:03.349 --> 00:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
critical
 
00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
that whatever they were recommending
 
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
that i should be doing is what i did
 
00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
so even though it says against the will
 
00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:12.320 align:start position:0%
i concerned about how
 
00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
independent that will really is when a
 
00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:16.720 align:start position:0%
parent is basically at that point in
 
00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:18.069 align:start position:0%
parent is basically at that point in
time

00:39:18.069 --> 00:39:18.079 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:39:20.069 --> 00:39:20.079 align:start position:0%
saying to do something
 
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
even though they don't believe it or
 
00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
don't think they should do it
 
00:39:25.349 --> 00:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
the reality is
 
00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:26.720 align:start position:0%
they're god
 
00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
so therefore i don't think you can
 
00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
actually put something that says against
 
00:39:31.349 --> 00:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
the will because i don't think they have
 
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
independent will
 
00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
i'm 68 now and i still to my father
 
00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
who's 90 and his
 
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
opinion of me and what he has still
 
00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
carries tremendous amount of weight so i
 
00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
don't think we ever believe that
 
00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
representative pearson i think
 
00:39:53.589 --> 00:39:53.599 align:start position:0%
we look to our parents with a whole
 
00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
different viewpoint regardless of her
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
age more so when we're young for sure
 
00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
but even to this day i look to my father
 
00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
and his opinion means a lot to me
 
00:40:07.829 --> 00:40:07.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman and and i
 
00:40:13.109 --> 00:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
would agree i i appreciate your efforts
 
00:40:15.349 --> 00:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
to change this to
 
00:40:15.359 --> 00:40:16.870 align:start position:0%
to change this to
um

00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:19.109 --> 00:40:19.119 align:start position:0%
solve the problem that you see even
 
00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
though you
 
00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
are clearly against any kind of coercive
 
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
therapy so i
 
00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
give you kudos for making this attempt i
 
00:40:31.349 --> 00:40:31.359 align:start position:0%
would also not support this amendment
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
i was able to speak to
 
00:40:39.829 --> 00:40:39.839 align:start position:0%
dr good now who is
 
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
chair of the board of mental health who
 
00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
informs me that there has never been a
 
00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
complaint since the statute came into
 
00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:49.240 align:start position:0%
being of someone
 
00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
inappropriately talking to a client
 
00:40:51.599 --> 00:40:52.710 align:start position:0%
inappropriately talking to a client
about

00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:53.990 align:start position:0%
about
their

00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
questioning their sexual orientation or
 
00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:57.910 align:start position:0%
questioning their sexual orientation or
identity

00:40:57.910 --> 00:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
identity
 
00:40:59.349 --> 00:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
00:41:01.349 --> 00:41:01.359 align:start position:0%
has never been brought to the board
 
00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
so i would say that
 
00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
this is a problem this is an attempt to
 
00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
fix a problem that really does not exist
 
00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:09.910 align:start position:0%
fix a problem that really does not exist
um

00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
i know
 
00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
we disagree about that um but
 
00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
my long experience in the mental health
 
00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
field tells me that
 
00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
um the problem of
 
00:41:23.349 --> 00:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
clinicians being fearful about talking
 
00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
to young people about their sexuality
 
00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
about their discomfort
 
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
feelings that are not aligned with what
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
they think they should
 
00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
be feeling
 
00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
it's just i don't believe that it's a
 
00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:41.750 align:start position:0%
it's just i don't believe that it's a
problem

00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
therefore i think there's no reason for
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
this bill or for the
 
00:41:45.599 --> 00:41:46.710 align:start position:0%
this bill or for the
amendment

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:46.720 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
i also would like to just speak a little
 
00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:51.200 align:start position:0%
bit to what representative merchant um
 
00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:52.069 align:start position:0%
bit to what representative merchant um
said

00:41:52.069 --> 00:41:52.079 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
which is that i think there is just a
 
00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
power differential between
 
00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:57.750 align:start position:0%
power differential between
adults

00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
adults
 
00:42:01.109 --> 00:42:01.119 align:start position:0%
and 15 16 17 year olds
 
00:42:01.119 --> 00:42:03.829 align:start position:0%
and 15 16 17 year olds
and

00:42:03.829 --> 00:42:03.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes we wish they would listen to
 
00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
us more
 
00:42:09.829 --> 00:42:09.839 align:start position:0%
but in fact they listen to us a lot
 
00:42:11.170 --> 00:42:11.180 align:start position:0%
and i think that
 
00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:14.790 align:start position:0%
and i think that
[Music]

00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
this bill the way it's written the
 
00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
amendment the way it's written would
 
00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
still allow a parent to choose who the
 
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
therapist was
 
00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
who the who the what kind of therapy the
 
00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
therapist practiced what their biases
 
00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
might be and send their child to that
 
00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:33.510 align:start position:0%
might be and send their child to that
therapist

00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
therapist
 
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
and i think therefore the problem
 
00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:38.720 align:start position:0%
i would also say that in the last
 
00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
section where it talked about
 
00:42:43.589 --> 00:42:43.599 align:start position:0%
if the therapy in question is alleged to
 
00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
have consisted of speech only the
 
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
relevant licensing authority shall
 
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
presume that the therapy was client
 
00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:52.230 align:start position:0%
presume that the therapy was client
directed

00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
directed
 
00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
and i know you put in a less clause
 
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
speech only therapy or talk therapy
 
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.750 align:start position:0%
speech only therapy or talk therapy
certainly

00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
can be
 
00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
coercive can be pressured and um
 
00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
i don't think this is the kind of like
 
00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
question we want to be litigated um in
 
00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
each case in front of a licensing board
 
00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
um i think the licensee boards go by
 
00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:24.640 align:start position:0%
professional ethics
 
00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
they will take care of these kind of
 
00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
situations without this bill
 
00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
so for all those reasons i would vote
 
00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
against the amendment as well as against
 
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
if somebody now of any age
 
00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
but especially tender age
 
00:43:45.829 --> 00:43:45.839 align:start position:0%
is dropped off
 
00:43:47.589 --> 00:43:47.599 align:start position:0%
at a therapist
 
00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
with the words
 
00:43:52.069 --> 00:43:52.079 align:start position:0%
fix him
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
and that is the charge to the therapist
 
00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
i want
 
00:43:59.670 --> 00:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
the fear of that client yelping loudly
 
00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
to be honored
 
00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
just as i want
 
00:44:05.589 --> 00:44:05.599 align:start position:0%
those therapists who have told me
 
00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
they're running scared
 
00:44:10.069 --> 00:44:10.079 align:start position:0%
in the other direction i want to honor
 
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
the fear
 
00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
even if it's not necessary in law
 
00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
i want to honor both sides
 
00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
representative snow
 
00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
you are the keeper mary of the
 
00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
microphone and the on off switch it's a
 
00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
coveted position
 
00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:38.480 align:start position:0%
which is why we brought you in today
 
00:44:41.349 --> 00:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
having only read the i i did get to see
 
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
your amendment ahead of time so i did i
 
00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
did know i put it up right now
 
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
so i do know a little more about i just
 
00:44:49.829 --> 00:44:49.839 align:start position:0%
want to make one other point that he
 
00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
didn't make and i do have a letter here
 
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
from the national association of social
 
00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
workers that confirms that there has
 
00:44:57.589 --> 00:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
never been a problem in that particular
 
00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
area and that no social worker that
 
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
anyone knows of that if they had a
 
00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
circumstance like that when someone was
 
00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:06.640 align:start position:0%
dropped off i personally would not have
 
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
a problem seeing that youngster as long
 
00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
as i didn't make a
 
00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
promise to him that there's something i
 
00:45:13.589 --> 00:45:13.599 align:start position:0%
could do
 
00:45:16.309 --> 00:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
to convert his sexual identity
 
00:45:18.309 --> 00:45:18.319 align:start position:0%
that's the only thing that's out but
 
00:45:19.829 --> 00:45:19.839 align:start position:0%
certainly to deal with the feelings that
 
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
he's had
 
00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:22.720 align:start position:0%
when you talked about the desperation
 
00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
there's absolutely no prohibition to any
 
00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
of us
 
00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
from doing that and i would just like
 
00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
also like to point out one other thing
 
00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
knowing yourself and you do sometimes
 
00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
see people like this
 
00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
and i know you as a person and i know
 
00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
you as an approach would be the most
 
00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
gentle person in the world about how you
 
00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
handle this
 
00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
but also when you talk with some of
 
00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
these professional organizations even
 
00:45:47.109 --> 00:45:47.119 align:start position:0%
the most gentle approach
 
00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
is totally ineffective in making the
 
00:45:52.069 --> 00:45:52.079 align:start position:0%
change and secondly even the very gentle
 
00:45:55.109 --> 00:45:55.119 align:start position:0%
approach does tend to foster feelings of
 
00:45:55.119 --> 00:45:56.230 align:start position:0%
approach does tend to foster feelings of
guilt

00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
guilt
 
00:45:58.870 --> 00:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
shame and social isolation even done in
 
00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
that form and obviously when you get up
 
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
to the more coercive methods
 
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
you get into some very dangerous
 
00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
situations even cruel and and perverse
 
00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:10.790 align:start position:0%
situations even cruel and and perverse
and

00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
to ban this is absolutely necessary i
 
00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
would like to see it banned not just for
 
00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
licensed professionals but for anyone
 
00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:20.720 align:start position:0%
any self-appointed life coach
 
00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
sexual identity counselor that called
 
00:46:25.589 --> 00:46:25.599 align:start position:0%
himself that that if they engage in this
 
00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
that they ought to be banned too but i
 
00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
don't know how to go about doing that
 
00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
and that's not included in this bill
 
00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
but i would have to oppose the amendment
 
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
only because i really feel that more
 
00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
harm than help can be done even though i
 
00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
know your intention
 
00:46:41.109 --> 00:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
is to do the right thing i'm sorry mr
 
00:46:44.309 --> 00:46:44.319 align:start position:0%
chair okay anyone else
 
00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:46.079 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
i am a new member on the new hampshire
 
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
council to prevent suicides and i
 
00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
actually sat in on one of the data
 
00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
meetings and they were going through
 
00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
some of the data that they had from the
 
00:46:58.550 --> 00:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
youth risk behavior survey
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have trans as an identity on
 
00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
there they had straight gay bisexual not
 
00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
sure and there were people who didn't
 
00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:07.190 align:start position:0%
sure and there were people who didn't
answer

00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
answer
 
00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
what was really terrifying looking at it
 
00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
was that the not sure and the bisexual
 
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
had so much more of an increased risk of
 
00:47:18.309 --> 00:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
suicidal ideation and suicide attempts
 
00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
there was a large group of individuals
 
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
who aren't sure how to categorize
 
00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
themselves i don't know if that's
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
because trans was left off of the survey
 
00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
which may be the reason because if your
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
answer is not there you're going to say
 
00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
not sure that's a good test taker
 
00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
but i
 
00:47:36.549 --> 00:47:36.559 align:start position:0%
the reason why i was working to try and
 
00:47:39.829 --> 00:47:39.839 align:start position:0%
find a way where people can go in and
 
00:47:41.829 --> 00:47:41.839 align:start position:0%
have a safe place where they can discuss
 
00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
how they feel
 
00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
and the practitioner doesn't feel that
 
00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
they have to only have affirmative
 
00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
counseling for the for the therapy that
 
00:47:52.549 --> 00:47:52.559 align:start position:0%
they can explore it with somebody who
 
00:47:54.069 --> 00:47:54.079 align:start position:0%
might not be sure they might not be
 
00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
ready to make that move
 
00:47:57.670 --> 00:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
or maybe they don't want to
 
00:47:59.190 --> 00:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
but to
 
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
remove that language that says only
 
00:48:03.349 --> 00:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
affirmative therapy because
 
00:48:05.829 --> 00:48:05.839 align:start position:0%
i i don't know how it's going to impact
 
00:48:07.670 --> 00:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
each individual i do know that
 
00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:09.200 align:start position:0%
counseling against somebody's will
 
00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
directive therapy is immoral and
 
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
unethical the question
 
00:48:15.589 --> 00:48:15.599 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure that we have
 
00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
those protected places because these
 
00:48:19.349 --> 00:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
kids are attempting suicide at a much
 
00:48:20.549 --> 00:48:20.559 align:start position:0%
higher rate
 
00:48:23.589 --> 00:48:23.599 align:start position:0%
and i don't want to take any opportunity
 
00:48:26.069 --> 00:48:26.079 align:start position:0%
for them to get counseling to express
 
00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.079 align:start position:0%
their feelings and determine who they
 
00:48:28.079 --> 00:48:28.790 align:start position:0%
their feelings and determine who they
are

00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:48:30.549 --> 00:48:30.559 align:start position:0%
not be told who they are but to
 
00:48:33.109 --> 00:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
determine who they are themselves
 
00:48:35.109 --> 00:48:35.119 align:start position:0%
and hearing from counselors who are
 
00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
afraid to see minors because of this law
 
00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
means that our shortage of mental health
 
00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
professionals is even worse
 
00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
and i i believe ethics will keep any of
 
00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
these course of things out and that's
 
00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
why i want to make sure we increase
 
00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:49.910 align:start position:0%
why i want to make sure we increase
access

00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
access
 
00:48:51.589 --> 00:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i would just like
 
00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
to follow up on what representative leon
 
00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
was saying
 
00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
not only ethics but i think also
 
00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
liability is a huge motivator to stay
 
00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
away from
 
00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
coercive therapy and it's pretty clear
 
00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
in this that
 
00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
any therapy that is coercive in nature
 
00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
that is not in the
 
00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
interest of
 
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
what direction the patient would like
 
00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
the therapy to go is entering into
 
00:49:17.589 --> 00:49:17.599 align:start position:0%
dangerous territory for a therapist and
 
00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
that's a great deterrent
 
00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:20.309 align:start position:0%
that's a great deterrent
and

00:49:20.309 --> 00:49:20.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
it's not about what the parents want
 
00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
you know most therapy sessions are a
 
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
half hour to an hour long with the
 
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
patient privately
 
00:49:30.309 --> 00:49:30.319 align:start position:0%
and if there is a teenager in there who
 
00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
wants to explore their sexual
 
00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
orientation or gender identity
 
00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:36.390 align:start position:0%
orientation or gender identity
um

00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
this this ensures that they can do that
 
00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
and that more therapists will be willing
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
to have the conversations
 
00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:44.390 align:start position:0%
to have the conversations
and

00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
you know they won't be concerned that
 
00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
they're going to face disciplinary
 
00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
action just for having those
 
00:49:53.829 --> 00:49:53.839 align:start position:0%
conversations so we need this bill
 
00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
00:49:56.790 --> 00:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:49:59.750 --> 00:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
just in terms of the word um affirmative
 
00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:01.030 align:start position:0%
just in terms of the word um affirmative
i

00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
didn't think of it in the terms of being
 
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:06.640 align:start position:0%
affirmative for a particular
 
00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
end point i to interpret affirmative
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
being supportive
 
00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
of the individual regardless of what
 
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
their discussion may be i want this i
 
00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
want that or i'm not sure
 
00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
supportive i and i interpret the word
 
00:50:23.829 --> 00:50:23.839 align:start position:0%
affirmative in that vein
 
00:50:27.349 --> 00:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
so would i sir representative shapiro
 
00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman um
 
00:50:33.349 --> 00:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
i would just want to acknowledge that
 
00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
it was a failure on the part of people
 
00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:37.109 align:start position:0%
it was a failure on the part of people
who

00:50:37.109 --> 00:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to defeat this bill to not have
 
00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
clinicians come
 
00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.230 align:start position:0%
clinicians come
and

00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:50:44.230 --> 00:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
testify on the other side i think there
 
00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
were two psychologists and a
 
00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:47.270 align:start position:0%
were two psychologists and a
psychiatrist

00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist
 
00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
you know that they were intimidated by
 
00:50:56.549 --> 00:50:56.559 align:start position:0%
this law and would therefore not talk to
 
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
adolescents about their sexuality um i
 
00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:00.880 align:start position:0%
acknowledged that they were here i
 
00:51:02.549 --> 00:51:02.559 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that people were not here on
 
00:51:03.829 --> 00:51:03.839 align:start position:0%
the other side
 
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
um i don't know how to convince you of
 
00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
this but
 
00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:09.990 align:start position:0%
this but
my

00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
my absolute belief is that they are
 
00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:13.910 align:start position:0%
my absolute belief is that they are
outliers

00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
outliers
 
00:51:17.349 --> 00:51:17.359 align:start position:0%
and that um if people had known and
 
00:51:20.069 --> 00:51:20.079 align:start position:0%
people had organized around this
 
00:51:24.309 --> 00:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy ban being in um
 
00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
in danger that you would have had many
 
00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
many more clinicians and maybe that has
 
00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
to wait till it gets to the senate if it
 
00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:32.800 align:start position:0%
somehow makes it through the house but
 
00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:34.630 align:start position:0%
somehow makes it through the house but
um

00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:34.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
once again i would just say that i think
 
00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
this is a an attempt to fix a problem
 
00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
that absolutely does not exist
 
00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
i spoke with
 
00:51:46.630 --> 00:51:46.640 align:start position:0%
two counselors who are not in the room
 
00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
who agreed with those who were in the
 
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
room so that only makes it five to no
 
00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:51.270 align:start position:0%
room so that only makes it five to no
shows

00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
shows
 
00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
but still
 
00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
it wasn't just the three representative
 
00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:56.309 align:start position:0%
it wasn't just the three representative
cannon

00:51:56.309 --> 00:51:56.319 align:start position:0%
cannon
 
00:51:58.470 --> 00:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:00.640 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
when this when the original bill was
 
00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
first brought forward the language that
 
00:52:08.549 --> 00:52:08.559 align:start position:0%
was submitted for our statute is was
 
00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
identically used in a number of other
 
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
states and still is in place
 
00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:16.870 align:start position:0%
states and still is in place
and

00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:19.349 --> 00:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
a challenge that we were faced with is
 
00:52:23.109 --> 00:52:23.119 align:start position:0%
recognizing that there were a number of
 
00:52:25.349 --> 00:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
youth who were already
 
00:52:27.349 --> 00:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
had already
 
00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
had difficulty with conversion therapy
 
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
and many had taken their life because of
 
00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:34.390 align:start position:0%
and many had taken their life because of
it

00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:38.549 --> 00:52:38.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
not having a supportive home back in the
 
00:52:43.349 --> 00:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
60s that i could even think about coming
 
00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:45.839 align:start position:0%
out as well as a church then
 
00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
thought i was an abomination
 
00:52:50.549 --> 00:52:50.559 align:start position:0%
forced me into the closet with a lot of
 
00:52:50.559 --> 00:52:54.309 align:start position:0%
forced me into the closet with a lot of
pain

00:52:54.309 --> 00:52:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
when we brought this the original bill
 
00:52:59.589 --> 00:52:59.599 align:start position:0%
forward we didn't include
 
00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
people over the age of 18
 
00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:04.640 align:start position:0%
because they have the right to decide
 
00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
for themselves already
 
00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:09.109 align:start position:0%
for themselves already
as

00:53:09.109 --> 00:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
as adults
 
00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
and so we did not include that in like
 
00:53:14.790 --> 00:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
because they have the right to do
 
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
whatever they want to do
 
00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:25.589 --> 00:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
protection of their parents or their
 
00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:32.870 --> 00:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
i i really appreciate your efforts to
 
00:53:35.349 --> 00:53:35.359 align:start position:0%
improve this bill
 
00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
but i'm afraid that i'm i'm not going to
 
00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
be able to support it
 
00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
thank you amendment
 
00:53:44.309 --> 00:53:44.319 align:start position:0%
who hasn't spoken yet before we go to
 
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
round two
 
00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
representative snow
 
00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
i would just like to point out in
 
00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
response to what uh representative leon
 
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:52.870 align:start position:0%
response to what uh representative leon
said

00:53:52.870 --> 00:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
it is true that people that are going
 
00:53:56.230 --> 00:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
through this struggle are at a much
 
00:53:58.150 --> 00:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
higher risk of suicide
 
00:54:00.309 --> 00:54:00.319 align:start position:0%
but i've also read articles to show that
 
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
people who are going through this
 
00:54:03.109 --> 00:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
struggle and engage in this kind of
 
00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
treatment are even higher
 
00:54:07.990 --> 00:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
the rate it tends to promote that
 
00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:10.640 align:start position:0%
thinking even further rather than reduce
 
00:54:12.309 --> 00:54:12.319 align:start position:0%
it and
 
00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:19.910 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:21.589 align:start position:0%
 
query

00:54:21.589 --> 00:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
query
 
00:54:22.829 --> 00:54:22.839 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
um i just want to follow up on what uh
 
00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
representative snow just said um
 
00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:30.950 align:start position:0%
representative snow just said um
this

00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
this is a hard debate um
 
00:54:36.789 --> 00:54:36.799 align:start position:0%
i grew up in rural midwest
 
00:54:39.349 --> 00:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
and this is something that
 
00:54:39.359 --> 00:54:41.349 align:start position:0%
and this is something that
um

00:54:41.349 --> 00:54:41.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
that i grew up with
 
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of friends being put through this
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
whether it was through personal
 
00:54:49.349 --> 00:54:49.359 align:start position:0%
counseling of you know licensed
 
00:54:51.349 --> 00:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
therapist or
 
00:54:51.359 --> 00:54:53.910 align:start position:0%
therapist or
church

00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:55.349 align:start position:0%
 
sanctioned

00:54:55.349 --> 00:54:55.359 align:start position:0%
sanctioned
 
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
groups that would
 
00:55:00.309 --> 00:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
to just further on
 
00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
the fact that
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
kids follow what their parents
 
00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:07.510 align:start position:0%
kids follow what their parents
say

00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
they want to make their parents proud
 
00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
and when they go into these conversion
 
00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:14.630 align:start position:0%
and when they go into these conversion
therapies

00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
therapies
 
00:55:17.829 --> 00:55:17.839 align:start position:0%
and they are continuing to have the same
 
00:55:17.839 --> 00:55:19.030 align:start position:0%
and they are continuing to have the same
feelings

00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
feelings
 
00:55:21.829 --> 00:55:21.839 align:start position:0%
the same same-sex feelings that they are
 
00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
there to get rid of
 
00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
they are only seeing themselves as more
 
00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
failures to their parents
 
00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
they are only making themselves realize
 
00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
that there's no way out for them
 
00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
which is leading them closer and closer
 
00:55:38.789 --> 00:55:38.799 align:start position:0%
to making that decision
 
00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
this is an ongoing
 
00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:42.789 align:start position:0%
this is an ongoing
crisis

00:55:42.789 --> 00:55:42.799 align:start position:0%
crisis
 
00:55:45.349 --> 00:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
for the lgbtq community
 
00:55:47.589 --> 00:55:47.599 align:start position:0%
as we see bills like this
 
00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
rolling back
 
00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:50.549 align:start position:0%
rolling back
protections

00:55:50.549 --> 00:55:50.559 align:start position:0%
protections
 
00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
for us to live our lives
 
00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
it brings even the most secure and out
 
00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:57.670 align:start position:0%
it brings even the most secure and out
people

00:55:57.670 --> 00:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
to the edge of making those decisions we
 
00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
are speaking to the amendment
 
00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:04.069 align:start position:0%
are speaking to the amendment
representative

00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:06.150 --> 00:56:06.160 align:start position:0%
in that case i will cut it
 
00:56:09.030 --> 00:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
there but i will just say
 
00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh i am against this amendment and the
 
00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
underlying bill
 
00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
representative king
 
00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
all right i'm i'm um
 
00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
sitting here a little confused and
 
00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
if you know me well that's not a
 
00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
that's not a
 
00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:27.190 align:start position:0%
that's not a
um

00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:28.829 --> 00:56:28.839 align:start position:0%
unusual so
 
00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
um i know when this bill originally came
 
00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%
it just just flat out said repeal
 
00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
the original
 
00:56:38.549 --> 00:56:38.559 align:start position:0%
the law that's currently in place
 
00:56:38.559 --> 00:56:39.510 align:start position:0%
the law that's currently in place
and

00:56:39.510 --> 00:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
i don't think there was a single member
 
00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
on this committee that agreed with
 
00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy just to be
 
00:56:47.030 --> 00:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
square on this
 
00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
and so what
 
00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
the chairman has done
 
00:56:54.069 --> 00:56:54.079 align:start position:0%
is gone back and tried to define
 
00:56:56.150 --> 00:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
what conversion therapy is because we
 
00:56:58.549 --> 00:56:58.559 align:start position:0%
had people here at the hearing
 
00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
that said they were confused as well
 
00:57:04.710 --> 00:57:04.720 align:start position:0%
and that they needed boundaries on where
 
00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
they could be
 
00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
in their therapy
 
00:57:09.829 --> 00:57:09.839 align:start position:0%
and i think that what this amendment's
 
00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:12.640 align:start position:0%
trying to do is to outline those
 
00:57:15.829 --> 00:57:15.839 align:start position:0%
boundaries am i mistaken
 
00:57:19.349 --> 00:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:21.349 --> 00:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
representative kanark
 
00:57:23.589 --> 00:57:23.599 align:start position:0%
just a quick thing i think the original
 
00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
the statute as it stands does
 
00:57:27.829 --> 00:57:27.839 align:start position:0%
do those boundaries and for example it
 
00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
says conversion therapy shall not
 
00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
include so on and so on identity
 
00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
exploration so it is not something where
 
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
one has to use affirming and
 
00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
representing leon's thing but more in
 
00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
representative woods it does give those
 
00:57:40.789 --> 00:57:40.799 align:start position:0%
boundaries we're taking away those
 
00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:46.640 align:start position:0%
representative merchant
 
00:57:48.549 --> 00:57:48.559 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
has this amendment we've talked about
 
00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:51.829 align:start position:0%
has this amendment we've talked about
the

00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:54.640 align:start position:0%
five therapists that came and spoke
 
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
about three and two i found like three
 
00:57:58.470 --> 00:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
and two and yeah three and two which
 
00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
that's i think goes back to five
 
00:58:02.789 --> 00:58:02.799 align:start position:0%
um in regards to
 
00:58:04.309 --> 00:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
this issue because
 
00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
without them looking at this amendment
 
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
and understanding it
 
00:58:10.069 --> 00:58:10.079 align:start position:0%
from their viewpoint is this going to
 
00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
fix their
 
00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:13.280 align:start position:0%

being crafted one made a suggestion all
 
00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
five have read it as you see it and they
 
00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
believe yes it will
 
00:58:26.309 --> 00:58:26.319 align:start position:0%
deal with their fears thank you in a way
 
00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
that the original law on the books does
 
00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:30.710 align:start position:0%
that the original law on the books does
not

00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
not

the the therapists and not the people
 
01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:49.760 align:start position:0%

01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:50.710 align:start position:0%

um
 
01:00:59.349 --> 01:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
having the the therapists and counselors
 
01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
and all of them
 
01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
give uh feedback on the amendment and
 
01:01:04.789 --> 01:01:04.799 align:start position:0%
therefore the bill
 
01:01:08.549 --> 01:01:08.559 align:start position:0%
um however i would love to know how many
 
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh people in the lgbtq plus community
 
01:01:14.789 --> 01:01:14.799 align:start position:0%
you look to and asked for their
 
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
feedback on this
 
01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
the question of the chair um
 
01:01:21.349 --> 01:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
i have not
 
01:01:24.549 --> 01:01:24.559 align:start position:0%
asked anyone because the numbers of
 
01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
emails i've got
 
01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
from those individuals you just
 
01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
delineated was considerable i didn't
 
01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
need to ask for any more i had several
 
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:43.349 --> 01:01:43.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and i just wanted
 
01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
to state that um
 
01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
i certainly appreciate the amendment
 
01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the concern behind the
 
01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
amendment i really appreciate the
 
01:01:54.630 --> 01:01:54.640 align:start position:0%
removal of the
 
01:01:57.990 --> 01:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:59.750 --> 01:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
line although i agree with
 
01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
representative cannon that people who
 
01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
are over the age of 18 may make their
 
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
own decisions and therefore they can
 
01:02:09.349 --> 01:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
they are under a less
 
01:02:12.069 --> 01:02:12.079 align:start position:0%
coercive situation than they would be if
 
01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
they were a minor
 
01:02:18.309 --> 01:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
i just think that the drafting of the
 
01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
language on page two
 
01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:22.230 align:start position:0%
language on page two
uh

01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:02:25.109 --> 01:02:25.119 align:start position:0%
is really opening a whole set of other
 
01:02:28.150 --> 01:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
cans of worms and uh
 
01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:29.349 align:start position:0%
cans of worms and uh
i

01:02:29.349 --> 01:02:29.359 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
don't see the reason to change
 
01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
that having been said i think we're
 
01:02:36.549 --> 01:02:36.559 align:start position:0%
better off with the original statute and
 
01:02:38.309 --> 01:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
that is certainly
 
01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:40.559 align:start position:0%
the advice that i have gotten from the
 
01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
many people of the affected communities
 
01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
who have written to me and said they
 
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
want to keep the original statute and
 
01:02:51.109 --> 01:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
that was as an affirmative statement so
 
01:02:53.029 --> 01:02:53.039 align:start position:0%
that's how i will be voting thank you
 
01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
the reason for
 
01:02:57.750 --> 01:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
the paragraphs three and four
 
01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
was because of lines one and two on page
 
01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
two unprofessional conduct and shall be
 
01:03:05.589 --> 01:03:05.599 align:start position:0%
subject to such discipline as the
 
01:03:07.829 --> 01:03:07.839 align:start position:0%
relevant licensing authority deems
 
01:03:07.839 --> 01:03:09.109 align:start position:0%
relevant licensing authority deems
appropriate

01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
01:03:11.829 --> 01:03:11.839 align:start position:0%
well if you're gonna sue me
 
01:03:14.069 --> 01:03:14.079 align:start position:0%
you're gonna take my license away
 
01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
we've gotta have some definitions here
 
01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
and three and four is
 
01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:21.270 align:start position:0%
and three and four is
akin

01:03:21.270 --> 01:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
akin
 
01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:21.770 align:start position:0%
akin
to

01:03:21.770 --> 01:03:21.780 align:start position:0%

items that i have seen in other
 
01:03:29.029 --> 01:03:29.039 align:start position:0%
laws that follow
 
01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:36.069 --> 01:03:36.079 align:start position:0%

01:03:47.589 --> 01:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
this may shock a few few folks but um
 
01:03:49.829 --> 01:03:49.839 align:start position:0%
as i've read through your amendment
 
01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
as as it applies to the bill
 
01:03:56.789 --> 01:03:56.799 align:start position:0%
that's in front of us
 
01:03:59.750 --> 01:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
where it does not
 
01:04:03.270 --> 01:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
force a repeal of the existing
 
01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:05.990 align:start position:0%
force a repeal of the existing
statute

01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:06.710 align:start position:0%
 
it

01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:07.670 align:start position:0%
it
does

01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
does
 
01:04:10.069 --> 01:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
improve the statute for a number of
 
01:04:10.079 --> 01:04:11.670 align:start position:0%
improve the statute for a number of
folks

01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
folks
 
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
and as such
 
01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
i will be supporting
 
01:04:17.829 --> 01:04:17.839 align:start position:0%
a bill
 
01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
in this with this amendment
 
01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:28.480 align:start position:0%
sing nothing further
 
01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:35.990 --> 01:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative freitas to the rescue
 
01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much i don't
 
01:04:38.710 --> 01:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
know why i have much problems with
 
01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:40.230 align:start position:0%
know why i have much problems with
microphones

01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
microphones
 
01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
i i know this may sound a lot like sour
 
01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
grape what we're doing is enabling a
 
01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
bill to come into effect that's
 
01:04:47.270 --> 01:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
surprising to make it more possible for
 
01:04:49.589 --> 01:04:49.599 align:start position:0%
people to get a treatment technique that
 
01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
clearly does not work about the
 
01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
preponderance of evidence
 
01:04:54.789 --> 01:04:54.799 align:start position:0%
if the words are against the
 
01:04:56.549 --> 01:04:56.559 align:start position:0%
individual's will and the individual
 
01:04:58.230 --> 01:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't want treatment the individual
 
01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
knows doesn't work i think we've got
 
01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:08.789 --> 01:05:08.799 align:start position:0%
seeing nothing further
 
01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:15.680 align:start position:0%

advisory committee as constituted in law
 
01:10:03.910 --> 01:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
has wonderful people in it but most of
 
01:10:06.630 --> 01:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
them aren't trained in ethics
 
01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
i have groups of people who speak to me
 
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
economically politically
 
01:10:13.350 --> 01:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
people representing various special
 
01:10:16.470 --> 01:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
interest groups but i need an ethics
 
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
committee comprised of people trained in
 
01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:21.510 align:start position:0%
committee comprised of people trained in
ethics

01:10:21.510 --> 01:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
ethics
 
01:10:23.910 --> 01:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
at which point i got to meet some
 
01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
fascinating people in the realms of
 
01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:27.750 align:start position:0%
fascinating people in the realms of
law

01:10:27.750 --> 01:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:10:30.790 --> 01:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
and medicine in psychology
 
01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
and all of that
 
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
who said what a wonderful idea let's
 
01:10:37.990 --> 01:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
have the ethics advisory committee be
 
01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
made up of various people who have
 
01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
studied to some good degree or other the
 
01:10:45.669 --> 01:10:45.679 align:start position:0%
field of ethics
 
01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
now ethics isn't
 
01:10:50.709 --> 01:10:50.719 align:start position:0%
this exactly the same
 
01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
from profession to profession but
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of overlap the venn
 
01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
diagram shows a lot of commonality in
 
01:11:01.350 --> 01:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
how to think on an issue ethically
 
01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
so the members of the committee as
 
01:11:05.910 --> 01:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
delineated in the amendment
 
01:11:07.350 --> 01:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
were run by
 
01:11:09.430 --> 01:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
the commissioner
 
01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
who will benefit from this committee and
 
01:11:15.110 --> 01:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
she has given her
 
01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
imprimatur to this list
 
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.189 align:start position:0%
imprimatur to this list
so

01:11:19.189 --> 01:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:21.669 --> 01:11:21.679 align:start position:0%
the original prime sponsor is very
 
01:11:23.590 --> 01:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
grateful for the
 
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:26.560 align:start position:0%

01:21:16.629 --> 01:21:16.639 align:start position:0%
give you about a minute more and then
 
01:21:18.390 --> 01:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
we're going to ask both representative
 
01:21:20.229 --> 01:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
webber and representative leon to
 
01:21:26.070 --> 01:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
i only made 22
 
01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh well i
 
01:21:32.229 --> 01:21:32.239 align:start position:0%
my amendment is
 
01:21:32.239 --> 01:21:36.470 align:start position:0%
my amendment is
2022.0946h

01:21:36.470 --> 01:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:39.030 --> 01:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
and what i did was i took
 
01:21:41.990 --> 01:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
a significant amount but not all of the
 
01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
original bill and i placed it into the
 
01:21:46.390 --> 01:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
patient's bill of rights
 
01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:47.270 align:start position:0%
patient's bill of rights
um

01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:48.550 align:start position:0%
um
as

01:21:48.550 --> 01:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:50.070 align:start position:0%
as
number

01:21:50.070 --> 01:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:21:51.910 --> 01:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
as as
 
01:21:53.910 --> 01:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
an addition to the end of the patient's
 
01:21:56.229 --> 01:21:56.239 align:start position:0%
bill of rights
 
01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
in doing so i kept all four of the
 
01:22:02.870 --> 01:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
pieces in the original bill
 
01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:05.110 align:start position:0%
pieces in the original bill
that

01:22:05.110 --> 01:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:22:07.590 --> 01:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
the visitation policies might be limited
 
01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
or restricted when the presence of
 
01:22:11.030 --> 01:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
visitors would be medically or
 
01:22:12.870 --> 01:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
therapeutically contraindicated in the
 
01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
best clinical judgment of health care
 
01:22:18.390 --> 01:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
professionals that is not in
 
01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:19.430 align:start position:0%
professionals that is not in
um

01:22:19.430 --> 01:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
the leon amendment but i think maybe i
 
01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
should just talk to mine and and then
 
01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:24.550 align:start position:0%
should just talk to mine and and then
talk

01:22:24.550 --> 01:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
talk
 
01:22:27.189 --> 01:22:27.199 align:start position:0%
we'll discuss among ourselves afterwards
 
01:22:27.199 --> 01:22:28.709 align:start position:0%
we'll discuss among ourselves afterwards
um

01:22:28.709 --> 01:22:28.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:32.470 --> 01:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
issue that we the other things that we
 
01:22:36.629 --> 01:22:36.639 align:start position:0%
changed was that the health care
 
01:22:39.510 --> 01:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
facility is going to do its own
 
01:22:41.910 --> 01:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
drafting and posting of policies rather
 
01:22:44.870 --> 01:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
than requiring that from the department
 
01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:51.750 --> 01:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:55.350 --> 01:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
the wording on lines five to nine
 
01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:56.790 align:start position:0%
the wording on lines five to nine
because

01:22:56.790 --> 01:22:56.800 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:22:58.629 --> 01:22:58.639 align:start position:0%
when inserting it in the patient's bill
 
01:23:01.110 --> 01:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
of rights i i changed it to sort of
 
01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
track as far as i could the existing
 
01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
language and the patient's bill of
 
01:23:06.550 --> 01:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
rights about the patient shall have the
 
01:23:07.830 --> 01:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
right to so
 
01:23:10.470 --> 01:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
that's slightly redrafted and i put
 
01:23:12.550 --> 01:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
uh minors and adults in the same
 
01:23:14.310 --> 01:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
paragraph so that's those are the
 
01:23:16.229 --> 01:23:16.239 align:start position:0%
changes that i made but
 
01:23:18.390 --> 01:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
i i want to point out that in keeping
 
01:23:21.030 --> 01:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
the original language i i kept the
 
01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
language which has i believe been
 
01:23:25.750 --> 01:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
approved in other places so thank you
 
01:23:27.030 --> 01:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:23:29.430 --> 01:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
representative leon on your amendment
 
01:23:30.830 --> 01:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:32.709 align:start position:0%
which is
0953

01:23:32.709 --> 01:23:32.719 align:start position:0%
0953
 
01:23:34.229 --> 01:23:34.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
01:23:36.229 --> 01:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
representative weber for doing most of
 
01:23:39.350 --> 01:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
the lifting for me um as you pointed out
 
01:23:42.310 --> 01:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
um our amendment removes the line that
 
01:23:44.149 --> 01:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
says um
 
01:23:44.159 --> 01:23:45.270 align:start position:0%
says um
oops

01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
oops
 
01:23:47.110 --> 01:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
i'm reading it from yours here the
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
presence of visitors will be medically
 
01:23:50.790 --> 01:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
or therapeutically contraindicated in
 
01:23:52.550 --> 01:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
the best clinical judgment of healthcare
 
01:23:54.629 --> 01:23:54.639 align:start position:0%
professionals because there was a lot of
 
01:23:57.270 --> 01:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
concern that that would just allow just
 
01:23:58.950 --> 01:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
a straight out veto from some of the
 
01:24:01.189 --> 01:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
doctors in one of these scenarios
 
01:24:03.430 --> 01:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
in order to recognize that in some
 
01:24:05.669 --> 01:24:05.679 align:start position:0%
scenarios and some time frames there may
 
01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:07.280 align:start position:0%
be a need to further
 
01:24:10.470 --> 01:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
limit visitors we added the word written
 
01:24:13.110 --> 01:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
to what's line 20 on our amendment so
 
01:24:15.110 --> 01:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
visitors are non-compliant with written
 
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
hospital policy
 
01:24:18.390 --> 01:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
that would allow the hospitals to make
 
01:24:20.629 --> 01:24:20.639 align:start position:0%
clear what they need to do in terms of
 
01:24:23.110 --> 01:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
their visitation for reimbursement from
 
01:24:24.629 --> 01:24:24.639 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
01:24:26.550 --> 01:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
because they have a certain protocol
 
01:24:28.470 --> 01:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
because hospitalizations are over a
 
01:24:30.550 --> 01:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
certain rate it would allow them to have
 
01:24:32.870 --> 01:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
the flexibility so long as they make
 
01:24:35.350 --> 01:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
that available to patients prospective
 
01:24:37.830 --> 01:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
patients and their loved ones
 
01:24:40.629 --> 01:24:40.639 align:start position:0%
this is trying to honor transparency and
 
01:24:42.790 --> 01:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
say that the hospital so long as they
 
01:24:45.350 --> 01:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
share their plans may make the decisions
 
01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
that are best for the practice of
 
01:24:49.669 --> 01:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
medicine in their hospital so we believe
 
01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
that that allowed us to balance the
 
01:24:53.350 --> 01:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
rights of the patients the needs of the
 
01:24:55.189 --> 01:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
hospital and all of the different
 
01:24:57.350 --> 01:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
stakeholders by just requiring those to
 
01:24:59.910 --> 01:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
be written in that policy so that is the
 
01:25:02.070 --> 01:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
main difference there
 
01:25:05.110 --> 01:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
representative weber the other main
 
01:25:07.110 --> 01:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
difference is that
 
01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
my amendment moves the
 
01:25:13.510 --> 01:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
policy to the patient's bill of rights
 
01:25:15.189 --> 01:25:15.199 align:start position:0%
because these are talking about the
 
01:25:16.950 --> 01:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
rights of the patient
 
01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
whereas the leon amendment i believe
 
01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:21.750 align:start position:0%
whereas the leon amendment i believe
keeps

01:25:21.750 --> 01:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
keeps
 
01:25:24.390 --> 01:25:24.400 align:start position:0%
this as part of the licensing statute
 
01:25:25.830 --> 01:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
rather than moving it to the patient's
 
01:25:27.270 --> 01:25:27.280 align:start position:0%
bill of rights
 
01:25:30.390 --> 01:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
yes it does thank you sorry i apologize
 
01:25:33.110 --> 01:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
um and if you look on page 2 lines 18
 
01:25:35.430 --> 01:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
through 20 we actually make that same
 
01:25:36.629 --> 01:25:36.639 align:start position:0%
new number
 
01:25:38.229 --> 01:25:38.239 align:start position:0%
roman 22
 
01:25:40.390 --> 01:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
and we simply reference to that statute
 
01:25:42.390 --> 01:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
and the licensing which would say which
 
01:25:43.990 --> 01:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
says the patient shall be entitled to
 
01:25:47.830 --> 01:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
have visitors pursuant to rsa 151 to j
 
01:25:50.149 --> 01:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
um so that that's not all
 
01:25:52.390 --> 01:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
gumming up the works within the patient
 
01:25:55.430 --> 01:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
bill of rights
 
01:25:57.669 --> 01:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
but i appreciate that putting it in the
 
01:26:00.390 --> 01:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
bill of that is lines 18 through 20 on
 
01:26:02.709 --> 01:26:02.719 align:start position:0%
page two of the amendment
 
01:26:04.470 --> 01:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
um and but i appreciate that having that
 
01:26:06.629 --> 01:26:06.639 align:start position:0%
information there i see both arguments
 
01:26:07.910 --> 01:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
of leaving it in the facilities
 
01:26:10.470 --> 01:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
licensing or in putting it fully in
 
01:26:12.790 --> 01:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
patients in the patient bill of rights
 
01:26:14.310 --> 01:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
we just wanted to make sure that the
 
01:26:15.990 --> 01:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
hospitals knew that they needed to write
 
01:26:18.070 --> 01:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
that policy and make it available and
 
01:26:20.709 --> 01:26:20.719 align:start position:0%
that's why we we remained with it in the
 
01:26:23.030 --> 01:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
original section and just linked it back
 
01:26:25.830 --> 01:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
with that new paragraph in section three
 
01:26:28.390 --> 01:26:28.400 align:start position:0%
page two lines eighteen through twenty
 
01:26:31.189 --> 01:26:31.199 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative shapiro
 
01:26:33.510 --> 01:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative leon
 
01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
this is just a clarification
 
01:26:37.750 --> 01:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
are are you saying
 
01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:39.669 align:start position:0%
are are you saying
that

01:26:39.669 --> 01:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:26:39.679 --> 01:26:40.470 align:start position:0%
that
the

01:26:40.470 --> 01:26:40.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:26:42.709 --> 01:26:42.719 align:start position:0%
line that's in representative weber's
 
01:26:44.550 --> 01:26:44.560 align:start position:0%
amendment about
 
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
visitors could be restricted if
 
01:26:47.910 --> 01:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
medically or therapeutically
 
01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:52.229 align:start position:0%
medically or therapeutically
contraindicated

01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:56.310 --> 01:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
is really included in your
 
01:26:57.830 --> 01:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
letter c
 
01:26:59.830 --> 01:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
as long as it was in the
 
01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:08.149 --> 01:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
if that was the hospital policy if it's
 
01:27:10.870 --> 01:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
in their written policy then yes
 
01:27:12.629 --> 01:27:12.639 align:start position:0%
but we want to have them have a written
 
01:27:15.990 --> 01:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
policy but could that policy be a
 
01:27:19.669 --> 01:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
changing policy you know based on like
 
01:27:22.149 --> 01:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
for example a surge of covet or does it
 
01:27:25.510 --> 01:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:26.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:27:26.550 --> 01:27:26.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:28.229 align:start position:0%
um
well

01:27:28.229 --> 01:27:28.239 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:27:30.149 --> 01:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
it's a written policy one that's made
 
01:27:32.229 --> 01:27:32.239 align:start position:0%
available to patients and prospective
 
01:27:32.239 --> 01:27:33.510 align:start position:0%
available to patients and prospective
patients

01:27:33.510 --> 01:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
patients
 
01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
01:27:37.270 --> 01:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
i can't imagine they'd be updating it
 
01:27:39.350 --> 01:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
hour by hour even day by day
 
01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:40.070 align:start position:0%
hour by hour even day by day
but

01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:27:41.990 --> 01:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
as situations change as they ebb and
 
01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
flow they'll be able to be clear with
 
01:27:46.310 --> 01:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
the community that they serve about how
 
01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
they're approaching the current
 
01:27:51.910 --> 01:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:54.629 --> 01:27:54.639 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
01:27:57.350 --> 01:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
i just want to be clear that i
 
01:28:00.149 --> 01:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
without the language about the presence
 
01:28:01.910 --> 01:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
of visitors would be medically or
 
01:28:04.470 --> 01:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
therapeutically contraindicated then i
 
01:28:07.030 --> 01:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
think that a hospital that
 
01:28:09.510 --> 01:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
denies visitation on that basis is very
 
01:28:11.350 --> 01:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
much at risk and this is in their
 
01:28:14.470 --> 01:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
licensing statute so they are at risk of
 
01:28:16.470 --> 01:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
losing their license
 
01:28:19.110 --> 01:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
so that's item number one
 
01:28:22.709 --> 01:28:22.719 align:start position:0%
i would also point out uh with respect
 
01:28:25.270 --> 01:28:25.280 align:start position:0%
to item number
 
01:28:28.629 --> 01:28:28.639 align:start position:0%
uh the the issue of uh inclu
 
01:28:30.790 --> 01:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
incorporating it by reference into the
 
01:28:32.790 --> 01:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
patient's bill of rights
 
01:28:34.229 --> 01:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
there are lots of places where the
 
01:28:36.870 --> 01:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
patient's bill of rights is is you know
 
01:28:39.350 --> 01:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
tacked to the wall or printed on a card
 
01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
and handed to a patient
 
01:28:43.590 --> 01:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
and handing them something that says
 
01:28:45.590 --> 01:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
nothing in this section shall supersede
 
01:28:47.189 --> 01:28:47.199 align:start position:0%
the right of a patient who is terminally
 
01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:50.639 align:start position:0%
ill to have visitors pursuant to rsa 151
 
01:28:52.470 --> 01:28:52.480 align:start position:0%

01:28:57.430 --> 01:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
i whip out my computer and i have a
 
01:28:59.430 --> 01:28:59.440 align:start position:0%
direct link to the statutes so i would
 
01:29:02.709 --> 01:29:02.719 align:start position:0%
look that up but i think most patients
 
01:29:04.950 --> 01:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't and i i think they would be
 
01:29:07.030 --> 01:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
comforted by having words
 
01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
but my real concern is the location
 
01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
and the lack of the other the other
 
01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
language and i
 
01:29:15.510 --> 01:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
i want to thank everybody on the
 
01:29:17.350 --> 01:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittee who worked very hard
 
01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:18.629 align:start position:0%
subcommittee who worked very hard
because

01:29:18.629 --> 01:29:18.639 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:29:20.709 --> 01:29:20.719 align:start position:0%
we are all
 
01:29:23.189 --> 01:29:23.199 align:start position:0%
concerned about patients having the
 
01:29:25.430 --> 01:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate support
 
01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:26.709 align:start position:0%
appropriate support
at

01:29:26.709 --> 01:29:26.719 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:29:28.950 --> 01:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
a really difficult time
 
01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:31.270 align:start position:0%
a really difficult time
but

01:29:31.270 --> 01:29:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
we just were unable to agree on the way
 
01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
to go about it so
 
01:29:38.310 --> 01:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
representative leon wishes to respond um
 
01:29:39.669 --> 01:29:39.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
01:29:41.669 --> 01:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
representative weber if you look at the
 
01:29:43.750 --> 01:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
lines just below that that would be the
 
01:29:45.270 --> 01:29:45.280 align:start position:0%
section going into the patient bill of
 
01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
rights it would be line 20 which would
 
01:29:49.510 --> 01:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
be roman 22 saying the patient shall be
 
01:29:51.270 --> 01:29:51.280 align:start position:0%
entitled to have visitors pursuant to
 
01:29:53.750 --> 01:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
rsa 151 2j
 
01:29:56.149 --> 01:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
the one that you pointed out roman roman
 
01:29:58.470 --> 01:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
9 is the one that makes sure that this
 
01:30:00.950 --> 01:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't limit that end of life care and
 
01:30:02.390 --> 01:30:02.400 align:start position:0%
i do want to thank you and everybody
 
01:30:03.910 --> 01:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
else on the subcommittee too i think
 
01:30:05.830 --> 01:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
it's quite impressive how close we are
 
01:30:07.510 --> 01:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
on these two dueling amendments and i
 
01:30:10.470 --> 01:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
view that as a success um in the process
 
01:30:12.229 --> 01:30:12.239 align:start position:0%
and collaboration
 
01:30:12.239 --> 01:30:14.070 align:start position:0%
and collaboration
representative

01:30:14.070 --> 01:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:30:16.070 --> 01:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
yes just a clarification i think
 
01:30:18.470 --> 01:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
representative leon said that
 
01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:19.189 align:start position:0%
representative leon said that
the

01:30:19.189 --> 01:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:30:21.510 --> 01:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
if we look at the original bill lines 14
 
01:30:23.350 --> 01:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
and 15 the presence of visitors would be
 
01:30:24.470 --> 01:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
medically or therapeutically
 
01:30:26.229 --> 01:30:26.239 align:start position:0%
contraindicated and so on
 
01:30:28.870 --> 01:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
that that would be subsumed by point c
 
01:30:31.910 --> 01:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
on line 20 in the amendment but which
 
01:30:33.990 --> 01:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
amendment oh sorry her amendment uh
 
01:30:36.709 --> 01:30:36.719 align:start position:0%
representative both her
 
01:30:38.149 --> 01:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
uh you get a point there representative
 
01:30:39.910 --> 01:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
leon's amendment
 
01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:41.189 align:start position:0%
leon's amendment
um

01:30:41.189 --> 01:30:41.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:43.430 --> 01:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
line 20 says visitors are non-compliant
 
01:30:45.669 --> 01:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
with written hospital policy right yes
 
01:30:47.510 --> 01:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
the point is that speaking of a visitor
 
01:30:49.830 --> 01:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
not being compliant not that the they
 
01:30:52.310 --> 01:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
would have a policy against a specific
 
01:30:55.189 --> 01:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
visitation in a certain setting
 
01:30:56.950 --> 01:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
you'd want to have it say visitation is
 
01:30:58.790 --> 01:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
not compliant with hospital policy this
 
01:31:00.629 --> 01:31:00.639 align:start position:0%
says a visitor so that would be a person
 
01:31:02.229 --> 01:31:02.239 align:start position:0%
who says i'm not going to wear a mask
 
01:31:04.390 --> 01:31:04.400 align:start position:0%
when it's required so i don't think that
 
01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:06.149 align:start position:0%
when it's required so i don't think that
the

01:31:06.149 --> 01:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:31:08.390 --> 01:31:08.400 align:start position:0%
segment section a on the original bill
 
01:31:10.470 --> 01:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
is subsumed into
 
01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
c on the amendment
 
01:31:13.830 --> 01:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
because i think it's referring to a
 
01:31:15.830 --> 01:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
person not to a policy when we say
 
01:31:18.070 --> 01:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
visitor not visitation
 
01:31:19.510 --> 01:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
that's just my own personal
 
01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:24.629 align:start position:0%
that's just my own personal
interpretation

01:31:24.629 --> 01:31:24.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:28.470 --> 01:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:32.629 --> 01:31:32.639 align:start position:0%
i am totally 100 confused
 
01:31:34.709 --> 01:31:34.719 align:start position:0%
so what i'm looking through these two
 
01:31:34.719 --> 01:31:36.950 align:start position:0%
so what i'm looking through these two
amendments

01:31:36.950 --> 01:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
01:31:40.390 --> 01:31:40.400 align:start position:0%
they both seem to indicate
 
01:31:41.830 --> 01:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
the patient's bill of rights but this
 
01:31:44.470 --> 01:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
sounds like a smart about the visitors
 
01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:45.590 align:start position:0%
sounds like a smart about the visitors
rights

01:31:45.590 --> 01:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
rights
 
01:31:47.270 --> 01:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
so are we talking about the visitors
 
01:31:48.310 --> 01:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
right so we're talking about the
 
01:31:49.510 --> 01:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
patients rights because i'm really
 
01:31:51.189 --> 01:31:51.199 align:start position:0%
confused between the two which one we're
 
01:31:53.750 --> 01:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
actually talking about
 
01:31:56.149 --> 01:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
01:31:58.550 --> 01:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
okay well i'll take the first stab at it
 
01:32:00.629 --> 01:32:00.639 align:start position:0%
and we'll call done first it
 
01:32:02.470 --> 01:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
it came to us
 
01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:03.990 align:start position:0%
it came to us
as

01:32:03.990 --> 01:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:32:06.629 --> 01:32:06.639 align:start position:0%
more on the side of visitors rights and
 
01:32:08.629 --> 01:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
a number of people commented that this
 
01:32:10.950 --> 01:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
was really a patient right
 
01:32:13.110 --> 01:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
rather than a visitor's right
 
01:32:17.430 --> 01:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:18.709 --> 01:32:18.719 align:start position:0%
may be
 
01:32:21.110 --> 01:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
a little bit skewed towards visitors
 
01:32:23.030 --> 01:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
rights but
 
01:32:25.590 --> 01:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
the thing that we were trying to do
 
01:32:27.910 --> 01:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
the lang but the language in both cases
 
01:32:29.910 --> 01:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
says that
 
01:32:33.110 --> 01:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
the minor is entitled to or the adult is
 
01:32:36.950 --> 01:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
entitled to so it is a patient right
 
01:32:39.270 --> 01:32:39.280 align:start position:0%
the differences are
 
01:32:41.430 --> 01:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
and these i believe in representative
 
01:32:44.390 --> 01:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
leon may correct me if i am wrong
 
01:32:46.870 --> 01:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
in the weber amendment
 
01:32:50.950 --> 01:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
we have retained specifically
 
01:32:52.870 --> 01:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
that the presence of visitors would be
 
01:32:54.390 --> 01:32:54.400 align:start position:0%
medically or therapeutically
 
01:32:56.310 --> 01:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
contraindicated in the best clinical
 
01:32:58.629 --> 01:32:58.639 align:start position:0%
judge of health care professionals
 
01:33:01.110 --> 01:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
this is line 10 and 11 of the weber
 
01:33:03.430 --> 01:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
amendment and it does not appear in the
 
01:33:05.189 --> 01:33:05.199 align:start position:0%
leon amendment because that was one of
 
01:33:07.830 --> 01:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
the things we were having difficulty
 
01:33:10.390 --> 01:33:10.400 align:start position:0%
agreeing on
 
01:33:13.910 --> 01:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that that can be added
 
01:33:17.510 --> 01:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
to a hospital policy in the absence
 
01:33:19.590 --> 01:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
of our authorization
 
01:33:22.870 --> 01:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
or if it is added in the absence of our
 
01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:24.790 align:start position:0%
or if it is added in the absence of our
authorization

01:33:24.790 --> 01:33:24.800 align:start position:0%
authorization
 
01:33:27.590 --> 01:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
the hospital policy as a whole could be
 
01:33:31.350 --> 01:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
challenged because that isn't in there
 
01:33:34.070 --> 01:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
the thing that all of us struggled with
 
01:33:36.229 --> 01:33:36.239 align:start position:0%
in our discussions
 
01:33:39.189 --> 01:33:39.199 align:start position:0%
was to balance the rights
 
01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
of patient a
 
01:33:44.229 --> 01:33:44.239 align:start position:0%
to have the appropriate support
 
01:33:46.950 --> 01:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
and comfort of their loved ones or their
 
01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:48.830 align:start position:0%
and comfort of their loved ones or their
chosen

01:33:48.830 --> 01:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
chosen
 
01:33:54.550 --> 01:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
people and the right of patient b
 
01:33:56.310 --> 01:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
to have is
 
01:33:56.320 --> 01:33:57.910 align:start position:0%
to have is
least

01:33:57.910 --> 01:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
least
 
01:34:00.709 --> 01:34:00.719 align:start position:0%
unsafe an environment as we know how to
 
01:34:02.709 --> 01:34:02.719 align:start position:0%
provide them
 
01:34:05.910 --> 01:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
those are competing in many cases in a
 
01:34:08.310 --> 01:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
time of pandemic and and under other
 
01:34:10.390 --> 01:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
conditions as well
 
01:34:12.790 --> 01:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
and i think that we all
 
01:34:15.830 --> 01:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to get to a point where
 
01:34:18.149 --> 01:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
you know obviously no people aren't
 
01:34:20.229 --> 01:34:20.239 align:start position:0%
showing up in the emergency in the
 
01:34:22.390 --> 01:34:22.400 align:start position:0%
operating room and demanding to be there
 
01:34:25.350 --> 01:34:25.360 align:start position:0%
it it makes no sense but to have people
 
01:34:27.189 --> 01:34:27.199 align:start position:0%
have appropriate support on the one hand
 
01:34:29.590 --> 01:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
and appropriately safe care on the other
 
01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:31.110 align:start position:0%
and appropriately safe care on the other
hand

01:34:31.110 --> 01:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
hand
 
01:34:34.709 --> 01:34:34.719 align:start position:0%
the difference between the way we did it
 
01:34:38.310 --> 01:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
aside from that one line
 
01:34:40.390 --> 01:34:40.400 align:start position:0%
was that
 
01:34:42.390 --> 01:34:42.400 align:start position:0%
my amendment puts it in the patient's
 
01:34:45.109 --> 01:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
bill of rights which is where something
 
01:34:47.350 --> 01:34:47.360 align:start position:0%
that is a patient's right ought to go
 
01:34:49.990 --> 01:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
and which representative leons also does
 
01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:50.870 align:start position:0%
and which representative leons also does
only

01:34:50.870 --> 01:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
only
 
01:34:52.790 --> 01:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
incorporating it by reference which i
 
01:34:54.870 --> 01:34:54.880 align:start position:0%
don't think is as useful as seeing the
 
01:34:57.189 --> 01:34:57.199 align:start position:0%
actual words
 
01:34:57.199 --> 01:34:58.470 align:start position:0%
actual words
but

01:34:58.470 --> 01:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:35:00.950 --> 01:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
representative leons has it in the
 
01:35:03.990 --> 01:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
actual hospital licensing statute
 
01:35:05.830 --> 01:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
01:35:07.750 --> 01:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
as well as in by reference in the
 
01:35:09.830 --> 01:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
patient's bill of rights
 
01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
and that means that the hospitals are at
 
01:35:16.709 --> 01:35:16.719 align:start position:0%
far greater risk
 
01:35:19.350 --> 01:35:19.360 align:start position:0%
particularly without the protections of
 
01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:27.189 --> 01:35:27.199 align:start position:0%
when it comes to licensing as to whether
 
01:35:28.870 --> 01:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
they have complied with the licensing
 
01:35:35.750 --> 01:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:39.030 --> 01:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
chair asked paula minahan to come to the
 
01:35:41.189 --> 01:35:41.199 align:start position:0%
table please
 
01:35:43.510 --> 01:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
because she just might know what a few
 
01:35:46.870 --> 01:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:48.149 --> 01:35:48.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:35:49.910 --> 01:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative paula minnehan hospital
 
01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:52.470 align:start position:0%
representative paula minnehan hospital
association

01:35:52.470 --> 01:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
association
 
01:35:56.310 --> 01:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
did so is there a particular question um
 
01:35:58.550 --> 01:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
so regarding the patient bill of rights
 
01:35:58.560 --> 01:35:59.430 align:start position:0%
so regarding the patient bill of rights
um

01:35:59.430 --> 01:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:01.669 --> 01:36:01.679 align:start position:0%
it makes more sense to us that it be in
 
01:36:03.669 --> 01:36:03.679 align:start position:0%
the patient bill of rights um and this
 
01:36:06.149 --> 01:36:06.159 align:start position:0%
did come up during the work session that
 
01:36:08.229 --> 01:36:08.239 align:start position:0%
we believe um it should be the focus
 
01:36:10.709 --> 01:36:10.719 align:start position:0%
should be on the patient so um
 
01:36:13.430 --> 01:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
i um i do agree with representative
 
01:36:16.149 --> 01:36:16.159 align:start position:0%
weber um and i we actually are fine with
 
01:36:18.310 --> 01:36:18.320 align:start position:0%
that with representative weber's
 
01:36:20.070 --> 01:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
amendment moving it into the patient
 
01:36:23.590 --> 01:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
bill of rights it is um always um
 
01:36:25.350 --> 01:36:25.360 align:start position:0%
a challenge when you or you can
 
01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate so that's why it just makes
 
01:36:30.070 --> 01:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
much more sense to focus on the patient
 
01:36:33.350 --> 01:36:33.360 align:start position:0%
the um what i believe is um i'm just
 
01:36:36.470 --> 01:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
seeing the leon amendment now but um by
 
01:36:39.030 --> 01:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
taking out the um
 
01:36:41.910 --> 01:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
the sec the a thus the a in the original
 
01:36:43.990 --> 01:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
bill relative to the therapeutic
 
01:36:46.470 --> 01:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
medically and therapeutic um
 
01:36:49.510 --> 01:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
indications that is a non-starter for us
 
01:36:52.470 --> 01:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
it is that makes it a a really really
 
01:36:54.550 --> 01:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
problematic bill and we have
 
01:36:57.189 --> 01:36:57.199 align:start position:0%
testified to that and have stated that
 
01:36:59.590 --> 01:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
our members are very concerned about any
 
01:37:03.990 --> 01:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:06.070 --> 01:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
representative leon for a response um
 
01:37:08.629 --> 01:37:08.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh my question
 
01:37:10.950 --> 01:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
would be um or sorry i guess what i'm
 
01:37:12.550 --> 01:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out is i'm looking at
 
01:37:14.709 --> 01:37:14.719 align:start position:0%
this and saying that the visitors the
 
01:37:16.310 --> 01:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
visitors would be the ones that would be
 
01:37:18.390 --> 01:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
asked not to be in the room or not be in
 
01:37:20.390 --> 01:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
the facility if it was medically or
 
01:37:23.270 --> 01:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
therapeutically contraindicated
 
01:37:26.149 --> 01:37:26.159 align:start position:0%
and if the visitors are the ones who are
 
01:37:28.390 --> 01:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
having the behavior modified then it
 
01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
would be a matter of the visitors being
 
01:37:31.669 --> 01:37:31.679 align:start position:0%
compliant or non-compliant with the
 
01:37:33.669 --> 01:37:33.679 align:start position:0%
written hospital policy
 
01:37:35.510 --> 01:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
there's been so much confusion and so
 
01:37:38.149 --> 01:37:38.159 align:start position:0%
much stress for patients and their loved
 
01:37:39.910 --> 01:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
ones to understand what they actually
 
01:37:42.550 --> 01:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
can do when they can be in a room and
 
01:37:44.470 --> 01:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
when they can't be in the room
 
01:37:46.149 --> 01:37:46.159 align:start position:0%
and people who are missing the end of
 
01:37:47.669 --> 01:37:47.679 align:start position:0%
somebody's life because they declined
 
01:37:51.109 --> 01:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
faster than it was expected that knowing
 
01:37:52.470 --> 01:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
that it's not just about them and
 
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
whether or not the staff likes them
 
01:37:56.550 --> 01:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
but knowing what the policy is
 
01:37:58.470 --> 01:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
would be really comforting for a lot of
 
01:37:59.590 --> 01:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
these families who are going through a
 
01:38:01.350 --> 01:38:01.360 align:start position:0%
lot of trauma and i respect that the
 
01:38:02.870 --> 01:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
hospitals and the medical professionals
 
01:38:05.830 --> 01:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
are as well but um this is trying this
 
01:38:07.430 --> 01:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
is trying to balance
 
01:38:09.430 --> 01:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
these needs and so
 
01:38:12.709 --> 01:38:12.719 align:start position:0%
um currently the hospital's policies are
 
01:38:15.189 --> 01:38:15.199 align:start position:0%
on their website as as my testimony had
 
01:38:17.270 --> 01:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
indicated and if you go on the
 
01:38:20.149 --> 01:38:20.159 align:start position:0%
hospital's websites they are on there
 
01:38:23.270 --> 01:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
this is about establishing the policies
 
01:38:25.830 --> 01:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
and they are done with very
 
01:38:29.350 --> 01:38:29.360 align:start position:0%
careful consideration by clinicians and
 
01:38:31.030 --> 01:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:38:33.669 --> 01:38:33.679 align:start position:0%
depending on what the circumstances are
 
01:38:36.229 --> 01:38:36.239 align:start position:0%
forget about covid um we may we may have
 
01:38:38.870 --> 01:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
an ebola outbreak which we had at one
 
01:38:41.910 --> 01:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
point we may have a flu outbreak
 
01:38:44.470 --> 01:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
they need to and and i think there was a
 
01:38:46.229 --> 01:38:46.239 align:start position:0%
comment made that they don't change
 
01:38:49.109 --> 01:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
their policies every hour but i had one
 
01:38:50.790 --> 01:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
hospital indicate they changed their
 
01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
policies twice in one week that is a lot
 
01:38:55.750 --> 01:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
they have to go through a very extensive
 
01:38:58.390 --> 01:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
process for determining their policies
 
01:39:01.669 --> 01:39:01.679 align:start position:0%
again with the clinicians and those that
 
01:39:05.590 --> 01:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
are infectious disease specialists so
 
01:39:08.229 --> 01:39:08.239 align:start position:0%
that is very concerning to us to remove
 
01:39:10.149 --> 01:39:10.159 align:start position:0%
that language
 
01:39:12.470 --> 01:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
and i am concerned that this will just
 
01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
cause more confusion honestly um and um
 
01:39:19.750 --> 01:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
we don't have a state law now um
 
01:39:23.030 --> 01:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
the hospitals are trying to be as clear
 
01:39:25.109 --> 01:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
as possible for the patient for the
 
01:39:26.390 --> 01:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
visitors but
 
01:39:27.830 --> 01:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
you're saying about getting into the
 
01:39:29.990 --> 01:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
room they may not even be able to be
 
01:39:32.390 --> 01:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
allowed in the hospital depending on the
 
01:39:34.870 --> 01:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
situation fortunately things are much
 
01:39:37.910 --> 01:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
better now but um during a
 
01:39:41.109 --> 01:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
during the surge they were struggling
 
01:39:43.750 --> 01:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
with patients
 
01:39:46.310 --> 01:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
spilling out of their icus and and they
 
01:39:47.750 --> 01:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
had no space
 
01:39:50.229 --> 01:39:50.239 align:start position:0%
so it's it's very troubling to remove
 
01:39:51.910 --> 01:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
that language i think it's going to
 
01:39:54.229 --> 01:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
actually cause more more problems if we
 
01:39:59.350 --> 01:39:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:02.070 --> 01:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
follow up um if you wish
 
01:40:03.270 --> 01:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
i think i'll let other people ask
 
01:40:04.550 --> 01:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
 
01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:05.990 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
cushman

01:40:05.990 --> 01:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
cushman
 
01:40:07.910 --> 01:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i don't have a
 
01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:08.870 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i don't have a
question

01:40:08.870 --> 01:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:40:12.470 --> 01:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
it's okay a statement um
 
01:40:13.830 --> 01:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day we need to protect
 
01:40:15.430 --> 01:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
the rights of the patients and if the
 
01:40:17.590 --> 01:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
hospital can't make those
 
01:40:19.669 --> 01:40:19.679 align:start position:0%
available in writing
 
01:40:21.189 --> 01:40:21.199 align:start position:0%
and need to
 
01:40:23.590 --> 01:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
revoke rights on a whim
 
01:40:25.510 --> 01:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
it's not acceptable we need to put this
 
01:40:27.590 --> 01:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
through so that we ensure that patients
 
01:40:29.590 --> 01:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
have the right to have a caregiver a
 
01:40:32.390 --> 01:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
designee one person that can be there
 
01:40:34.629 --> 01:40:34.639 align:start position:0%
with them while they're receiving care
 
01:40:37.669 --> 01:40:37.679 align:start position:0%
and i am frankly
 
01:40:40.550 --> 01:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
fatigued by the excuses from the new
 
01:40:43.510 --> 01:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital association that that
 
01:40:46.070 --> 01:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
is not possible and that you need
 
01:40:48.149 --> 01:40:48.159 align:start position:0%
flexibility to keep family members out
 
01:40:50.229 --> 01:40:50.239 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry but when people are in the
 
01:40:52.149 --> 01:40:52.159 align:start position:0%
hospital and they need care they need
 
01:40:54.390 --> 01:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
their support people with them and this
 
01:40:56.629 --> 01:40:56.639 align:start position:0%
allows for ppe to be used there are
 
01:40:58.470 --> 01:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
plenty of mitigation
 
01:41:00.709 --> 01:41:00.719 align:start position:0%
methods to use but one
 
01:41:02.950 --> 01:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
visitor in the hospital with a family
 
01:41:05.430 --> 01:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
member who is probably in one of the
 
01:41:07.189 --> 01:41:07.199 align:start position:0%
worst situations of their life is
 
01:41:09.830 --> 01:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
something that they all need
 
01:41:11.750 --> 01:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
and rep and
 
01:41:13.830 --> 01:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
representative weber's amendment does
 
01:41:15.830 --> 01:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
address that and um
 
01:41:18.070 --> 01:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
i think we're going to agree to disagree
 
01:41:19.830 --> 01:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
relative to how
 
01:41:22.070 --> 01:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
hospitals have allowed for caregivers to
 
01:41:23.990 --> 01:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
be with their loved ones and they have
 
01:41:26.950 --> 01:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
been making accommodations certainly
 
01:41:29.510 --> 01:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
with when there's been end of life and
 
01:41:31.990 --> 01:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
it's just we've been in an extraordinary
 
01:41:34.629 --> 01:41:34.639 align:start position:0%
circumstance for the last two years so
 
01:41:34.639 --> 01:41:35.669 align:start position:0%
circumstance for the last two years so
um

01:41:35.669 --> 01:41:35.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:38.070 --> 01:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
i think we have attempted to the
 
01:41:39.830 --> 01:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
hospitals have attempted to be
 
01:41:41.830 --> 01:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
accommodating it's just
 
01:41:43.750 --> 01:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
there are certain situations that need
 
01:41:46.790 --> 01:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
to be um considered
 
01:41:49.270 --> 01:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
representative woods yeah thank you
 
01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:50.070 align:start position:0%
representative woods yeah thank you
um

01:41:50.070 --> 01:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:51.910 --> 01:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
just looking at its overall picture i
 
01:41:53.910 --> 01:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
i'm really in favor of putting this into
 
01:41:55.910 --> 01:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
the patient education that's where it's
 
01:41:59.030 --> 01:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
going to be most visible
 
01:42:01.109 --> 01:42:01.119 align:start position:0%
and part of this whole process is
 
01:42:01.119 --> 01:42:02.390 align:start position:0%
and part of this whole process is
education

01:42:02.390 --> 01:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:42:03.990 --> 01:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
if it's put in there in the patient's
 
01:42:05.990 --> 01:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
bill of rights they get that during a
 
01:42:08.709 --> 01:42:08.719 align:start position:0%
time of admission or it can be a flyer
 
01:42:10.950 --> 01:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
on the floor right uh but i appreciate
 
01:42:12.950 --> 01:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
that that it is referenced
 
01:42:15.350 --> 01:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
in representative leone's bill but
 
01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:16.390 align:start position:0%
in representative leone's bill but
that's

01:42:16.390 --> 01:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:42:18.229 --> 01:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
not as has been stated it's not going to
 
01:42:18.239 --> 01:42:19.030 align:start position:0%
not as has been stated it's not going to
be

01:42:19.030 --> 01:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:42:19.910 --> 01:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
something that they're going to be
 
01:42:21.669 --> 01:42:21.679 align:start position:0%
easily referenced so i think that's very
 
01:42:23.510 --> 01:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
important secondly
 
01:42:24.950 --> 01:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
i i too
 
01:42:27.590 --> 01:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
feel that the
 
01:42:28.870 --> 01:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
medically and therapeutically
 
01:42:32.229 --> 01:42:32.239 align:start position:0%
contraindicated is absolutely critical
 
01:42:35.910 --> 01:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
there has to be a captain of the ship
 
01:42:37.270 --> 01:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
and it can't be
 
01:42:39.590 --> 01:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
one family coming in and say i want this
 
01:42:41.430 --> 01:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
and this is my right and the next
 
01:42:43.270 --> 01:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
patient is coming in and say well i want
 
01:42:44.790 --> 01:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
this right
 
01:42:47.910 --> 01:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
there has to be somebody in charge
 
01:42:49.270 --> 01:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
and that's one of the response social
 
01:42:51.270 --> 01:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of physicians we accept
 
01:42:53.189 --> 01:42:53.199 align:start position:0%
that responsibility
 
01:42:55.910 --> 01:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
what i'm hearing is we don't trust
 
01:42:55.920 --> 01:42:57.350 align:start position:0%
what i'm hearing is we don't trust
physicians

01:42:57.350 --> 01:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
physicians
 
01:43:00.229 --> 01:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
and we only trust written policy
 
01:43:01.510 --> 01:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
i understand there's going to be some
 
01:43:03.990 --> 01:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
bad decisions absolutely
 
01:43:06.310 --> 01:43:06.320 align:start position:0%
but i think we have to understand too
 
01:43:09.030 --> 01:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
that if we let the public decide
 
01:43:11.270 --> 01:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
how this is going to occur
 
01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:13.430 align:start position:0%
how this is going to occur
um

01:43:13.430 --> 01:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:14.709 --> 01:43:14.719 align:start position:0%
there's going to be some bad decisions
 
01:43:14.719 --> 01:43:16.070 align:start position:0%
there's going to be some bad decisions
too

01:43:16.070 --> 01:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
too
 
01:43:17.830 --> 01:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
i think i'm just harking back there has
 
01:43:20.070 --> 01:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
to be a captain of the ship
 
01:43:22.229 --> 01:43:22.239 align:start position:0%
and we have to decide who we want that
 
01:43:23.669 --> 01:43:23.679 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:43:25.189 --> 01:43:25.199 align:start position:0%
yes there has to be some baseline
 
01:43:28.550 --> 01:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
policies but trust me you can't
 
01:43:30.470 --> 01:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
when you go to the emergency room you
 
01:43:32.310 --> 01:43:32.320 align:start position:0%
can't look the hospital policy about
 
01:43:34.550 --> 01:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
what you're going to do
 
01:43:37.750 --> 01:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
you have to act and that's what we're
 
01:43:39.750 --> 01:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
charged to do
 
01:43:41.830 --> 01:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
i think keeping that
 
01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:42.709 align:start position:0%
i think keeping that
that

01:43:42.709 --> 01:43:42.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:43:44.550 --> 01:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
line in about medical and therapeutic
 
01:43:46.870 --> 01:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
contraindicated is to me
 
01:43:49.109 --> 01:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
from my perspective as a physician
 
01:43:51.510 --> 01:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely critical
 
01:43:54.870 --> 01:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:57.189 --> 01:43:57.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:43:59.750 --> 01:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
i see merits in both of these amendments
 
01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:00.629 align:start position:0%
i see merits in both of these amendments
um

01:44:00.629 --> 01:44:00.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:03.430 --> 01:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
i do see the
 
01:44:04.950 --> 01:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
logic of putting in the patient bill of
 
01:44:06.390 --> 01:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
rights we're talking about the patient
 
01:44:08.149 --> 01:44:08.159 align:start position:0%
not the visitor
 
01:44:10.629 --> 01:44:10.639 align:start position:0%
however i do understand with you have a
 
01:44:10.639 --> 01:44:12.310 align:start position:0%
however i do understand with you have a
quote

01:44:12.310 --> 01:44:12.320 align:start position:0%
quote
 
01:44:14.149 --> 01:44:14.159 align:start position:0%
written hospital policy it does nothing
 
01:44:15.910 --> 01:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
to preclude the policy
 
01:44:18.229 --> 01:44:18.239 align:start position:0%
from including the presence of visitors
 
01:44:19.510 --> 01:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
would be medically therapeutically
 
01:44:21.030 --> 01:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
contraindicated that could go into the
 
01:44:22.790 --> 01:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
written policy of the hospital quite
 
01:44:24.790 --> 01:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
frankly i think that gives the hospitals
 
01:44:26.550 --> 01:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of credibility
 
01:44:28.310 --> 01:44:28.320 align:start position:0%
and a lot of flexibility in what they
 
01:44:30.070 --> 01:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
want to do with their policy based upon
 
01:44:31.189 --> 01:44:31.199 align:start position:0%
their needs
 
01:44:32.709 --> 01:44:32.719 align:start position:0%
versus the state telling them how to run
 
01:44:36.149 --> 01:44:36.159 align:start position:0%
the facility so i do think that
 
01:44:38.070 --> 01:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
there's merits in both as i mentioned
 
01:44:40.390 --> 01:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
one has a place which is a patient bill
 
01:44:41.270 --> 01:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
of rights we're talking about the
 
01:44:43.750 --> 01:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
patient not the facility so if really
 
01:44:45.189 --> 01:44:45.199 align:start position:0%
focus on the patient i think it should
 
01:44:47.189 --> 01:44:47.199 align:start position:0%
go in the patient's bill of rights
 
01:44:48.629 --> 01:44:48.639 align:start position:0%
if we're allowing the hospital have the
 
01:44:50.550 --> 01:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
flexibility to define their policy which
 
01:44:52.790 --> 01:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
is written it allows them at that point
 
01:44:54.390 --> 01:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
in time to include pretty much in that
 
01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
written policy however they want to run
 
01:44:57.669 --> 01:44:57.679 align:start position:0%
their facility
 
01:44:59.510 --> 01:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
so i'm looking at the two of them saying
 
01:45:01.030 --> 01:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
i wish i could have
 
01:45:03.590 --> 01:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
something between the two i can't
 
01:45:05.590 --> 01:45:05.600 align:start position:0%
the chair wishes to interject at this
 
01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:06.629 align:start position:0%
the chair wishes to interject at this
point

01:45:06.629 --> 01:45:06.639 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:45:08.470 --> 01:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
and say that this is monday and we're
 
01:45:10.709 --> 01:45:10.719 align:start position:0%
also meeting tomorrow
 
01:45:12.390 --> 01:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
you know me i love to square circles
 
01:45:15.109 --> 01:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
whenever i find them and i don't know if
 
01:45:17.430 --> 01:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
it's possible but if it's possible to
 
01:45:19.830 --> 01:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
meld the leon and weber amendment is
 
01:45:22.149 --> 01:45:22.159 align:start position:0%
there sympathy for that
 
01:45:25.910 --> 01:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
could i just clarify mr chairman yes
 
01:45:28.470 --> 01:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
my amendment allows the hospital to have
 
01:45:31.910 --> 01:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
the policy my amendment authorizes the
 
01:45:37.109 --> 01:45:37.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:39.590 --> 01:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
the considerations about presence of
 
01:45:41.830 --> 01:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
visitors being medically or
 
01:45:45.430 --> 01:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
therapeutically contraindicated
 
01:45:48.629 --> 01:45:48.639 align:start position:0%
the leon amendment also allows the
 
01:45:50.629 --> 01:45:50.639 align:start position:0%
hospital to have their own written
 
01:45:53.350 --> 01:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
policy they're no different in that
 
01:45:56.310 --> 01:45:56.320 align:start position:0%
we all agreed on that
 
01:45:58.550 --> 01:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
but the leon amendment does not
 
01:46:01.189 --> 01:46:01.199 align:start position:0%
specifically authorize the hospital to
 
01:46:03.669 --> 01:46:03.679 align:start position:0%
include the issue
 
01:46:05.430 --> 01:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
of medically or therapeutically
 
01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:07.510 align:start position:0%
of medically or therapeutically
contraindicated

01:46:07.510 --> 01:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
contraindicated
 
01:46:10.550 --> 01:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
which is a concern for the hospitals
 
01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
and if you're not concerned about the
 
01:46:14.149 --> 01:46:14.159 align:start position:0%
hospital's concern then that's not your
 
01:46:16.709 --> 01:46:16.719 align:start position:0%
concern either i mean other people
 
01:46:19.510 --> 01:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to balance things differently
 
01:46:21.030 --> 01:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
the real
 
01:46:23.109 --> 01:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
nub here is whether you put that
 
01:46:25.510 --> 01:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
language in or not in both cases the
 
01:46:28.470 --> 01:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
hospital gets to draft their policy
 
01:46:30.870 --> 01:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
but i think that if a hospital drafted a
 
01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:32.390 align:start position:0%
but i think that if a hospital drafted a
policy

01:46:32.390 --> 01:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
policy
 
01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:33.270 align:start position:0%
policy
that

01:46:33.270 --> 01:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:46:36.790 --> 01:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
was entirely on the basis that
 
01:46:39.990 --> 01:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
medically this is contraindicated
 
01:46:42.950 --> 01:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
and somebody could not visit that that
 
01:46:45.510 --> 01:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
hospital would be in jeopardy
 
01:46:47.270 --> 01:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
and if you put it in the licensing
 
01:46:49.189 --> 01:46:49.199 align:start position:0%
statute i think that hospital would be
 
01:46:51.910 --> 01:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
in jeopardy of losing their license
 
01:46:54.390 --> 01:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
that may be far-fetched it may be a
 
01:46:58.870 --> 01:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:00.870 --> 01:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
you know i think a lot of us need to go
 
01:47:03.590 --> 01:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
to the bathroom right now
 
01:47:07.750 --> 01:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
and as soon as we're done doing that
 
01:47:09.750 --> 01:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
i think the democrats can have the room
 
01:47:11.750 --> 01:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
here and the republicans can have the
 
01:47:13.669 --> 01:47:13.679 align:start position:0%
breakout room over there
 
01:47:16.550 --> 01:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
and let's do our business and followed
 
01:47:18.149 --> 01:47:18.159 align:start position:0%
by our business and be back here in
 
01:57:17.350 --> 01:57:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:21.090 --> 01:57:21.100 align:start position:0%
representative leon wishes to
 
01:57:21.100 --> 01:57:22.950 align:start position:0%
representative leon wishes to
[Music]

01:57:22.950 --> 01:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:57:27.189 --> 01:57:27.199 align:start position:0%
go get another amendment crafted uh my
 
01:57:30.470 --> 01:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
30 000 foot down view of it is to pick
 
01:57:32.310 --> 01:57:32.320 align:start position:0%
up some of the language of
 
01:57:35.589 --> 01:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
representative weber um i do suggest uh
 
01:57:37.189 --> 01:57:37.199 align:start position:0%
you you both
 
01:57:40.550 --> 01:57:40.560 align:start position:0%
chat and we'll see if we can um come up
 
01:57:41.830 --> 01:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
with something better tomorrow
 
01:57:43.510 --> 01:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
representative kanark
 
01:57:45.830 --> 01:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
yes i would just say for efficiency
 
01:57:47.669 --> 01:57:47.679 align:start position:0%
um although i appreciate that we might
 
01:57:50.229 --> 01:57:50.239 align:start position:0%
want to wait and get a new amendment
 
01:57:52.149 --> 01:57:52.159 align:start position:0%
was there any way possible we could just
 
01:57:54.790 --> 01:57:54.800 align:start position:0%
parse that language so that we actually
 
01:57:56.470 --> 01:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
submit one that we all like and then we
 
01:57:58.709 --> 01:57:58.719 align:start position:0%
can just get on with it uh if we if
 
01:58:00.229 --> 01:58:00.239 align:start position:0%
there's no reason for secrets we try to
 
01:58:01.910 --> 01:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
work together well and if we wait we
 
01:58:03.510 --> 01:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
don't see it till tomorrow and we don't
 
01:58:04.870 --> 01:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
like that then that's a problem we could
 
01:58:06.550 --> 01:58:06.560 align:start position:0%
try to come together right now
 
01:58:08.709 --> 01:58:08.719 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
01:58:10.870 --> 01:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
and we can all adjust address it here in
 
01:58:12.629 --> 01:58:12.639 align:start position:0%
an executive session i don't feel
 
01:58:15.990 --> 01:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
comfortable at this point in the process
 
01:58:17.750 --> 01:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
starting over with just two people
 
01:58:19.750 --> 01:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
talking about it i don't speak for
 
01:58:21.669 --> 01:58:21.679 align:start position:0%
everybody on
 
01:58:23.669 --> 01:58:23.679 align:start position:0%
on my side and i certainly don't speak
 
01:58:25.669 --> 01:58:25.679 align:start position:0%
for anybody out there so
 
01:58:27.990 --> 01:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
if if there is a compromise that you're
 
01:58:30.310 --> 01:58:30.320 align:start position:0%
considering it would be very helpful to
 
01:58:31.750 --> 01:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
have it stated
 
01:58:33.109 --> 01:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
so that we can
 
01:58:35.030 --> 01:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
indicate immediately whether that's
 
01:58:37.109 --> 01:58:37.119 align:start position:0%
going to be helpful or not and then
 
01:58:38.950 --> 01:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
move ahead
 
01:58:40.629 --> 01:58:40.639 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
01:58:42.950 --> 01:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman it's it's this is
 
01:58:44.950 --> 01:58:44.960 align:start position:0%
looking to put back the presence of
 
01:58:47.830 --> 01:58:47.840 align:start position:0%
visitors being contraindicated with some
 
01:58:49.109 --> 01:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
guide rails about providing the
 
01:58:51.350 --> 01:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
reasoning and writing um just so that we
 
01:58:53.270 --> 01:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
can make sure that those policies are
 
01:58:55.109 --> 01:58:55.119 align:start position:0%
actually individualized and not just a
 
01:58:57.830 --> 01:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
quiet hospital policy um need to get the
 
01:58:59.430 --> 01:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
actual language right but that is the
 
01:59:02.229 --> 01:59:02.239 align:start position:0%
intent of that amendment representative
 
01:59:02.239 --> 01:59:05.109 align:start position:0%
intent of that amendment representative
merchant

01:59:05.109 --> 01:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:06.629 --> 01:59:06.639 align:start position:0%
i'll depart the website representative
 
01:59:06.639 --> 01:59:08.070 align:start position:0%
i'll depart the website representative
weber

01:59:08.070 --> 01:59:08.080 align:start position:0%
weber
 
01:59:09.990 --> 01:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
and would that be put into the patient's
 
01:59:11.669 --> 01:59:11.679 align:start position:0%
bill of rights or into the licensing
 
01:59:11.679 --> 01:59:13.430 align:start position:0%
bill of rights or into the licensing
statute

01:59:13.430 --> 01:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:59:15.510 --> 01:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
it would be in the licensing statute
 
01:59:17.430 --> 01:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
it's a non-starter for us
 
01:59:20.870 --> 01:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:24.070 --> 01:59:24.080 align:start position:0%
if i may why why in the facility versus
 
01:59:25.270 --> 01:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
the patient's bill of rights we're
 
01:59:26.950 --> 01:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
talking about the patient here not the
 
01:59:28.870 --> 01:59:28.880 align:start position:0%
facility i think we're trying to be sure
 
01:59:30.870 --> 01:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
the patient has their rights
 
01:59:32.550 --> 01:59:32.560 align:start position:0%
and therefore the facility has to honor
 
01:59:34.390 --> 01:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
their rights so therefore indirectly it
 
01:59:36.149 --> 01:59:36.159 align:start position:0%
becomes part of the facility but it's
 
01:59:37.430 --> 01:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
actually in the right place because
 
01:59:39.030 --> 01:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
we're talking about patients
 
01:59:43.910 --> 01:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:45.990 --> 01:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
what's the consequence today for a
 
01:59:48.149 --> 01:59:48.159 align:start position:0%
hospital not following the patient bill
 
01:59:51.910 --> 01:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:55.510 --> 01:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:14.870 --> 02:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:14.880 --> 02:00:16.149 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:00:16.149 --> 02:00:16.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:00:18.870 --> 02:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
i i need to actually review the statute
 
02:00:21.270 --> 02:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
um i'm not you know an expert on exactly
 
02:00:24.550 --> 02:00:24.560 align:start position:0%
what the consequences are but they are
 
02:00:26.550 --> 02:00:26.560 align:start position:0%
they can be challenged
 
02:00:27.910 --> 02:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
that someone can raise it with the
 
02:00:30.310 --> 02:00:30.320 align:start position:0%
department again it does fall under 151
 
02:00:32.550 --> 02:00:32.560 align:start position:0%
it's just not a condition of licensure
 
02:00:34.229 --> 02:00:34.239 align:start position:0%
per se but
 
02:00:37.189 --> 02:00:37.199 align:start position:0%
the patient bill of rights are posted
 
02:00:40.229 --> 02:00:40.239 align:start position:0%
and those are available i i think a lot
 
02:00:42.229 --> 02:00:42.239 align:start position:0%
of hospitals post them um
 
02:00:45.510 --> 02:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
poster in an actual poster um posted in
 
02:00:48.229 --> 02:00:48.239 align:start position:0%
their facilities um and they are also
 
02:00:48.239 --> 02:00:49.189 align:start position:0%
their facilities um and they are also
um

02:00:49.189 --> 02:00:49.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:51.589 --> 02:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
posted and uh and given to a patient
 
02:00:53.430 --> 02:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
when they are admitted to the hospital
 
02:00:56.470 --> 02:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
so those are their their rights
 
02:00:58.070 --> 02:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh would you have any objection to
 
02:01:01.030 --> 02:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
moving it up to patients bill of rights
 
02:01:03.030 --> 02:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
yes i would there's an injection my
 
02:01:04.229 --> 02:01:04.239 align:start position:0%
objection is there's been a lot of
 
02:01:05.830 --> 02:01:05.840 align:start position:0%
broken trust and i know a lot of people
 
02:01:08.390 --> 02:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
who will refuse to go to the hospital
 
02:01:10.229 --> 02:01:10.239 align:start position:0%
and they would rather die at home than
 
02:01:12.070 --> 02:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
be denied the opportunity to have their
 
02:01:14.550 --> 02:01:14.560 align:start position:0%
loved ones with them i know
 
02:01:17.030 --> 02:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
many many many people
 
02:01:19.030 --> 02:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
who now are opting out of the medical
 
02:01:21.189 --> 02:01:21.199 align:start position:0%
system because they have lost this trust
 
02:01:22.790 --> 02:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
if the hospitals are doing the right
 
02:01:25.350 --> 02:01:25.360 align:start position:0%
thing on patient visitation then their
 
02:01:28.390 --> 02:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
licensing won't be at risk the option to
 
02:01:30.310 --> 02:01:30.320 align:start position:0%
have the written hospital policy for
 
02:01:32.950 --> 02:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
visitors provides a lot of leeway for
 
02:01:34.790 --> 02:01:34.800 align:start position:0%
the hospitals and we need to start
 
02:01:37.030 --> 02:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
rebuilding this trust and if the
 
02:01:39.030 --> 02:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
hospitals may have some threat against
 
02:01:40.709 --> 02:01:40.719 align:start position:0%
their licensing if they don't honor
 
02:01:43.109 --> 02:01:43.119 align:start position:0%
their own policies well i thought that's
 
02:01:46.229 --> 02:01:46.239 align:start position:0%
why we had policies um so i i won't i
 
02:01:48.390 --> 02:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
will not support it being solely in the
 
02:01:50.229 --> 02:01:50.239 align:start position:0%
patient bill of rights because we need
 
02:01:51.990 --> 02:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure that those rights aren't
 
02:01:53.750 --> 02:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
actually enforced
 
02:01:55.910 --> 02:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm just going to say i that is a
 
02:01:58.149 --> 02:01:58.159 align:start position:0%
stunning statement for you to say that
 
02:02:00.310 --> 02:02:00.320 align:start position:0%
the hospitals need to rebuild their
 
02:02:02.310 --> 02:02:02.320 align:start position:0%
trust they have been taking care of
 
02:02:04.470 --> 02:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
patients for the la for
 
02:02:06.550 --> 02:02:06.560 align:start position:0%
hundreds of years actually and in the
 
02:02:08.990 --> 02:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
last two years have been under
 
02:02:12.950 --> 02:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
extraordinary um stress i i am
 
02:02:15.430 --> 02:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
on behalf of our hospitals and our our
 
02:02:17.750 --> 02:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
caregivers that that is
 
02:02:20.149 --> 02:02:20.159 align:start position:0%
a very stunning and upsetting statement
 
02:02:22.470 --> 02:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
for me to hear you say that
 
02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:23.350 align:start position:0%
for me to hear you say that
god

02:02:23.350 --> 02:02:23.360 align:start position:0%
god
 
02:02:25.189 --> 02:02:25.199 align:start position:0%
i i don't really think i have anything
 
02:02:26.470 --> 02:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
else to say
 
02:02:28.390 --> 02:02:28.400 align:start position:0%
represented i think that means we need
 
02:02:29.830 --> 02:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
to do more to rebuild i have had
 
02:02:32.070 --> 02:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
hundreds of people share that so once we
 
02:02:34.229 --> 02:02:34.239 align:start position:0%
get past these sessions hopefully we can
 
02:02:36.470 --> 02:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
build back those relationships my
 
02:02:38.470 --> 02:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
suggestion is you go do what you need to
 
02:02:40.950 --> 02:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
do and we'll do what we need to do
 
02:02:43.990 --> 02:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
this could go on all day i'm gonna take
 
02:02:45.510 --> 02:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
three more people and then we're going
 
02:02:47.109 --> 02:02:47.119 align:start position:0%
to move on representative gay you've
 
02:02:49.030 --> 02:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
been patient
 
02:02:52.229 --> 02:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
thank you i just wanted to ask why we
 
02:02:54.629 --> 02:02:54.639 align:start position:0%
well i shouldn't say it negatively i
 
02:02:56.550 --> 02:02:56.560 align:start position:0%
would like to say
 
02:03:00.229 --> 02:03:00.239 align:start position:0%
keep the uh keep the re this stunning
 
02:03:00.239 --> 02:03:01.589 align:start position:0%
keep the uh keep the re this stunning
requirement

02:03:01.589 --> 02:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
02:03:01.599 --> 02:03:03.109 align:start position:0%
requirement
in

02:03:03.109 --> 02:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:03:05.270 --> 02:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
the leon amendment and
 
02:03:07.830 --> 02:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
make sure it's in the patient bill of
 
02:03:14.229 --> 02:03:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:18.070 --> 02:03:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:19.750 --> 02:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
one of the things he would be getting is
 
02:03:21.189 --> 02:03:21.199 align:start position:0%
about the licensing there's also
 
02:03:23.830 --> 02:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
accrediting organizations out there
 
02:03:25.990 --> 02:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
and haven't worked in hospitals for many
 
02:03:28.950 --> 02:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
many many years even though it's not a
 
02:03:30.470 --> 02:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
legal requirement
 
02:03:32.950 --> 02:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
but the accrediting organizations will
 
02:03:35.430 --> 02:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
not accredit a facility if they don't
 
02:03:38.149 --> 02:03:38.159 align:start position:0%
comply to the basics of what's required
 
02:03:40.229 --> 02:03:40.239 align:start position:0%
of them and one of those is actually the
 
02:03:41.589 --> 02:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
patient's bill of rights so even though
 
02:03:43.669 --> 02:03:43.679 align:start position:0%
we don't pull their license if the
 
02:03:45.030 --> 02:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
accrediting organization does not
 
02:03:46.709 --> 02:03:46.719 align:start position:0%
accredit them
 
02:03:48.229 --> 02:03:48.239 align:start position:0%
at that point in time they would lose
 
02:03:49.669 --> 02:03:49.679 align:start position:0%
the revenue stream so there is a
 
02:03:51.109 --> 02:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
consequence then for not following the
 
02:03:52.790 --> 02:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
patient bill of rights
 
02:03:53.990 --> 02:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
versus just looking at it from a
 
02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:55.510 align:start position:0%
versus just looking at it from a
licensing

02:03:55.510 --> 02:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
02:03:57.669 --> 02:03:57.679 align:start position:0%
so there is in my opinion i don't know
 
02:03:59.109 --> 02:03:59.119 align:start position:0%
again not an attorney but that's my
 
02:04:00.229 --> 02:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
understanding is don't forget the
 
02:04:01.669 --> 02:04:01.679 align:start position:0%
accrediting organizations that are out
 
02:04:03.750 --> 02:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
there and the impact they have on
 
02:04:05.830 --> 02:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
facilities and how they follow certain
 
02:04:07.990 --> 02:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
things because if you lose your revenue
 
02:04:09.510 --> 02:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
stream from an organization that's going
 
02:04:12.310 --> 02:04:12.320 align:start position:0%
to be really critical to you
 
02:04:14.950 --> 02:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
last one representative weber
 
02:04:16.629 --> 02:04:16.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:04:18.629 --> 02:04:18.639 align:start position:0%
it's very clear that we have two
 
02:04:20.870 --> 02:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
different points of view here
 
02:04:22.390 --> 02:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
it's very clear that we are still going
 
02:04:24.709 --> 02:04:24.719 align:start position:0%
to have two points of view tomorrow
 
02:04:26.790 --> 02:04:26.800 align:start position:0%
we have two stat two competing
 
02:04:28.870 --> 02:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
amendments in front of us
 
02:04:30.790 --> 02:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
um and and
 
02:04:35.030 --> 02:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:37.109 --> 02:04:37.119 align:start position:0%
my family and i looked after my husband
 
02:04:38.870 --> 02:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
at home in his last illness because
 
02:04:41.189 --> 02:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
that's what he wanted patients make
 
02:04:41.199 --> 02:04:43.189 align:start position:0%
that's what he wanted patients make
these

02:04:43.189 --> 02:04:43.199 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:04:43.199 --> 02:04:44.950 align:start position:0%
these
decisions

02:04:44.950 --> 02:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
02:04:47.350 --> 02:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
all the time he didn't want to be in a
 
02:04:50.310 --> 02:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
hospital he wanted to be in his own bed
 
02:04:53.430 --> 02:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
and i thank god even though i'm not sure
 
02:04:55.030 --> 02:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
i believe in one
 
02:04:58.470 --> 02:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
that we were able to do that for him
 
02:05:00.870 --> 02:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
but everybody has to make those
 
02:05:00.880 --> 02:05:02.550 align:start position:0%
but everybody has to make those
decisions

02:05:02.550 --> 02:05:02.560 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
02:05:04.629 --> 02:05:04.639 align:start position:0%
based on their own comfort level and
 
02:05:07.270 --> 02:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
their understanding of their needs
 
02:05:09.270 --> 02:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
i think what we should do is just go
 
02:05:11.430 --> 02:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
ahead and vote the amendments that are
 
02:05:13.109 --> 02:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
in front of us one way or another and
 
02:05:18.310 --> 02:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:20.470 --> 02:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
the chair is uh going to
 
02:05:23.030 --> 02:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
rule that representative leon may come
 
02:05:26.709 --> 02:05:26.719 align:start position:0%
back with an amendment tomorrow
 
02:05:28.709 --> 02:05:28.719 align:start position:0%
and then we will vote the amendments and
 
02:05:31.750 --> 02:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
i do not know at this point in which
 
02:05:31.760 --> 02:05:33.109 align:start position:0%
i do not know at this point in which
order

02:05:33.109 --> 02:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
order
 
02:05:35.669 --> 02:05:35.679 align:start position:0%
because the first one that is voted in
 
02:05:37.430 --> 02:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
will be replaced when the second one is
 
02:05:39.270 --> 02:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
voted in
 
02:05:40.870 --> 02:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
so this
 
02:05:40.880 --> 02:05:41.990 align:start position:0%
so this
ends

02:05:41.990 --> 02:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
ends
 
02:05:44.069 --> 02:05:44.079 align:start position:0%
for now the
 
02:05:46.709 --> 02:05:46.719 align:start position:0%
hearing on 14
 
02:05:46.719 --> 02:05:50.790 align:start position:0%
hearing on 14
39.

02:05:50.790 --> 02:05:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:53.830 --> 02:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
i now open the exact session on house

yes i have one it's also an amendment to

you sh should have had been given it
 
02:06:47.750 --> 02:06:47.760 align:start position:0%

ken
 
02:06:52.310 --> 02:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
yeah because it's you we're going to
 
02:06:54.870 --> 02:06:54.880 align:start position:0%

02:09:19.189 --> 02:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
because we have 23 bills eventually to
 
02:09:20.950 --> 02:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
do and we've only done three when you
 
02:09:23.669 --> 02:09:23.679 align:start position:0%
get the amendments please read them
 
02:09:26.069 --> 02:09:26.079 align:start position:0%
because we will not then not stop for
 
02:09:49.430 --> 02:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:51.750 --> 02:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
representative cushman please introduce
 
02:09:54.550 --> 02:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
your amendment 0499
 
02:09:56.629 --> 02:09:56.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman so before us we
 
02:09:59.109 --> 02:09:59.119 align:start position:0%
have an amendment to this bill that
 
02:09:59.119 --> 02:10:00.470 align:start position:0%
have an amendment to this bill that
requires

02:10:00.470 --> 02:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
requires
 
02:10:02.470 --> 02:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
explicit written consent
 
02:10:04.310 --> 02:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
from a child's parent or legal guardian
 
02:10:07.109 --> 02:10:07.119 align:start position:0%
for any treatments in school we expanded
 
02:10:08.550 --> 02:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
it to
 
02:10:11.589 --> 02:10:11.599 align:start position:0%
also screenings since we heard testimony
 
02:10:13.189 --> 02:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
that there were some screenings
 
02:10:13.199 --> 02:10:14.629 align:start position:0%
that there were some screenings
performed

02:10:14.629 --> 02:10:14.639 align:start position:0%
performed
 
02:10:17.030 --> 02:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
that are invasive and
 
02:10:19.910 --> 02:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
anything that is not
 
02:10:21.669 --> 02:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
related to education anything that's not
 
02:10:23.270 --> 02:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
educational in nature that's going on in
 
02:10:25.669 --> 02:10:25.679 align:start position:0%
public schools should require
 
02:10:28.870 --> 02:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
a consent from the parents
 
02:10:30.390 --> 02:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
and the other
 
02:10:32.950 --> 02:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
major changes that it also inserts that
 
02:10:34.790 --> 02:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
inserts the language
 
02:10:34.800 --> 02:10:36.870 align:start position:0%
inserts the language
into

02:10:36.870 --> 02:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
into
 
02:10:38.149 --> 02:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
not only the department of health and
 
02:10:40.870 --> 02:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
human services statutes but also the
 
02:10:43.750 --> 02:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
education statutes
 
02:10:46.069 --> 02:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
what line does the education statutes
 
02:10:49.990 --> 02:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
appear that is section three
 
02:10:53.910 --> 02:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:57.350 --> 02:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
so okay rsa200 got it thank you
 
02:10:59.510 --> 02:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative merchant your amendment
 
02:10:59.520 --> 02:11:00.390 align:start position:0%
representative merchant your amendment
looks

02:11:00.390 --> 02:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
looks
 
02:11:05.430 --> 02:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:07.270 --> 02:11:07.280 align:start position:0%
it is almost the same that's why it
 
02:11:10.629 --> 02:11:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:12.470 --> 02:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
after having some
 
02:11:15.270 --> 02:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
length conversations with
 
02:11:17.030 --> 02:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
someone in my family who's been a school
 
02:11:20.229 --> 02:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:23.030 --> 02:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
she did point out that
 
02:11:25.830 --> 02:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
in regards to treatment it's currently
 
02:11:27.350 --> 02:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
their policy has been away for a long
 
02:11:27.360 --> 02:11:28.390 align:start position:0%
their policy has been away for a long
time

02:11:28.390 --> 02:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:11:30.310 --> 02:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
that you cannot provide any treatment to
 
02:11:32.229 --> 02:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
a patient or in this case a minor
 
02:11:34.069 --> 02:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
without the explicit written consent of
 
02:11:35.750 --> 02:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
the parent
 
02:11:37.270 --> 02:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
the screenings under the hand become
 
02:11:40.229 --> 02:11:40.239 align:start position:0%
problematic because a lot of times
 
02:11:42.149 --> 02:11:42.159 align:start position:0%
it's the absentee parent
 
02:11:43.990 --> 02:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
that doesn't provide good parental
 
02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:45.350 align:start position:0%
that doesn't provide good parental
oversight

02:11:45.350 --> 02:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
02:11:46.950 --> 02:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
that needs to have the attention and
 
02:11:48.550 --> 02:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
screenings are not treatment this
 
02:11:50.470 --> 02:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
basically is a screening
 
02:11:53.430 --> 02:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
picking up on a child's vision
 
02:11:53.440 --> 02:11:54.870 align:start position:0%
picking up on a child's vision
hearing

02:11:54.870 --> 02:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
02:11:58.709 --> 02:11:58.719 align:start position:0%
etc is critical to that child
 
02:12:00.470 --> 02:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
and i just want to be sure that we talk
 
02:12:00.480 --> 02:12:01.430 align:start position:0%
and i just want to be sure that we talk
about

02:12:01.430 --> 02:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:12:03.669 --> 02:12:03.679 align:start position:0%
something that's not invasive
 
02:12:05.750 --> 02:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
it's strictly a screening
 
02:12:08.870 --> 02:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to protect the child
 
02:12:10.069 --> 02:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
from the
 
02:12:12.069 --> 02:12:12.079 align:start position:0%
off suit if you will
 
02:12:14.149 --> 02:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
of not having someone taken the time to
 
02:12:15.669 --> 02:12:15.679 align:start position:0%
sign a form
 
02:12:17.109 --> 02:12:17.119 align:start position:0%
because vision
 
02:12:18.790 --> 02:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
is critical hearing is critical you
 
02:12:20.629 --> 02:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
cannot learn accordingly if you don't
 
02:12:22.149 --> 02:12:22.159 align:start position:0%
have the two of them along with other
 
02:12:22.159 --> 02:12:22.950 align:start position:0%
have the two of them along with other
things

02:12:22.950 --> 02:12:22.960 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:12:24.870 --> 02:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
so she really advocated on my behalf
 
02:12:26.229 --> 02:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
which convinced me
 
02:12:28.629 --> 02:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
to take the word screenings out of this
 
02:12:31.750 --> 02:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
to allow that to occur without
 
02:12:34.229 --> 02:12:34.239 align:start position:0%
explicit written consent of the parent a
 
02:12:35.750 --> 02:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
lot of times parents will probably
 
02:12:36.950 --> 02:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
provide it
 
02:12:39.189 --> 02:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
but don't want to have it a requirement
 
02:12:40.629 --> 02:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
because again go back to the same thing
 
02:12:41.669 --> 02:12:41.679 align:start position:0%
she said
 
02:12:44.709 --> 02:12:44.719 align:start position:0%
gary the children who need it the most
 
02:12:46.069 --> 02:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
are probably the children of being
 
02:12:48.310 --> 02:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
neglected the most so she said you want
 
02:12:50.550 --> 02:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
to protect those children because it's
 
02:12:55.350 --> 02:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:57.830 --> 02:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
for the comments from anyone
 
02:12:59.589 --> 02:12:59.599 align:start position:0%
representative kanark uh yeah i was
 
02:13:01.830 --> 02:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
curious can you give an example of an
 
02:13:05.830 --> 02:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
invasive in quotes screening
 
02:13:08.310 --> 02:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
uh well yeah dental screenings are very
 
02:13:10.550 --> 02:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
invasive they enter a body cavity and
 
02:13:12.149 --> 02:13:12.159 align:start position:0%
especially for kids who have sensory
 
02:13:14.790 --> 02:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
issues this can be a problem
 
02:13:16.470 --> 02:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
i would say that any
 
02:13:18.870 --> 02:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
any screening really because this is an
 
02:13:21.589 --> 02:13:21.599 align:start position:0%
educational environment
 
02:13:23.990 --> 02:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
where students are meant to be educated
 
02:13:25.669 --> 02:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
it is not a
 
02:13:27.750 --> 02:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
community health clinic
 
02:13:29.669 --> 02:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's nice to have that
 
02:13:29.679 --> 02:13:30.709 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's nice to have that
available

02:13:30.709 --> 02:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
available
 
02:13:30.719 --> 02:13:31.510 align:start position:0%
available
but

02:13:31.510 --> 02:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:13:32.870 --> 02:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day people send their
 
02:13:35.510 --> 02:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
kids to school to be educated not to
 
02:13:37.030 --> 02:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
have medical interventions and
 
02:13:39.030 --> 02:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
screenings performed so if that's going
 
02:13:41.030 --> 02:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
to happen there needs to be positive
 
02:13:43.189 --> 02:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
consent for that representative connor
 
02:13:45.109 --> 02:13:45.119 align:start position:0%
follow up just a quick follow-up i i
 
02:13:46.709 --> 02:13:46.719 align:start position:0%
would agree that that would be wonderful
 
02:13:48.550 --> 02:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
in an ideal world but our public health
 
02:13:50.950 --> 02:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
system does not exist very well here
 
02:13:53.109 --> 02:13:53.119 align:start position:0%
which is why we actually also feed
 
02:13:54.870 --> 02:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
children at schools
 
02:13:56.470 --> 02:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
and other things because we
 
02:13:58.229 --> 02:13:58.239 align:start position:0%
unfortunately dump onto our schools a
 
02:14:00.069 --> 02:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
lot of the things that should be done
 
02:14:00.079 --> 02:14:01.189 align:start position:0%
lot of the things that should be done
elsewhere

02:14:01.189 --> 02:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
elsewhere
 
02:14:03.030 --> 02:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
and it would be wonderful if everybody
 
02:14:05.669 --> 02:14:05.679 align:start position:0%
had good health care access so they
 
02:14:07.830 --> 02:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
would get that screening but they don't
 
02:14:10.390 --> 02:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
and so it's a stop gap to try to help
 
02:14:10.400 --> 02:14:11.830 align:start position:0%
and so it's a stop gap to try to help
backfill

02:14:11.830 --> 02:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
backfill
 
02:14:14.629 --> 02:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
so kids don't get lost in the shuffle
 
02:14:16.310 --> 02:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
and not able to learn because they can't
 
02:14:18.790 --> 02:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
hear and they can't see
 
02:14:21.510 --> 02:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
the chair's comment is i recall in
 
02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:22.950 align:start position:0%
the chair's comment is i recall in
school

02:14:22.950 --> 02:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:14:24.550 --> 02:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
eye tests
 
02:14:28.229 --> 02:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
hearing tests looking into my mouth
 
02:14:30.310 --> 02:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
turning my head and coughing
 
02:14:32.950 --> 02:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
and others i can't think of right now
 
02:14:35.350 --> 02:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
and we discovered that the ones where
 
02:14:38.149 --> 02:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
there was uh oh something's wrong here
 
02:14:41.030 --> 02:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
with the kids who least likely ever went
 
02:14:42.709 --> 02:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
to medical care
 
02:14:47.030 --> 02:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
we were an educational and health center
 
02:14:48.470 --> 02:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
it was called the leominster public
 
02:14:51.350 --> 02:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
school system representative gay
 
02:14:52.870 --> 02:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:14:56.870 --> 02:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
my concern i i don't have a problem with
 
02:15:00.069 --> 02:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
doing the screenings at school
 
02:15:02.709 --> 02:15:02.719 align:start position:0%
i am i do have a friend who has a child
 
02:15:05.350 --> 02:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
who has a sensory problem and doesn't
 
02:15:07.030 --> 02:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
want to be touched and you know they
 
02:15:07.040 --> 02:15:07.750 align:start position:0%
want to be touched and you know they
have

02:15:07.750 --> 02:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:15:10.310 --> 02:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
but i'm thinking don't parents
 
02:15:13.430 --> 02:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
don't parents have to sign a release
 
02:15:15.830 --> 02:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
at some point at the beginning of school
 
02:15:19.270 --> 02:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
so there is a time an opportunity for
 
02:15:20.950 --> 02:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
the parents who
 
02:15:22.870 --> 02:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
have reservations about certain things
 
02:15:24.470 --> 02:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
for their child they do have that
 
02:15:27.270 --> 02:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity to say
 
02:15:29.750 --> 02:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
you know i need to be consulted
 
02:15:29.760 --> 02:15:32.069 align:start position:0%
you know i need to be consulted
but

02:15:32.069 --> 02:15:32.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:34.149 --> 02:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
i think it's a good idea to do the
 
02:15:37.430 --> 02:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
screenings and just allow the exceptions
 
02:15:39.589 --> 02:15:39.599 align:start position:0%
to be covered by their parents
 
02:15:41.189 --> 02:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
representative woods you had your hand
 
02:15:42.550 --> 02:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
up i believe
 
02:15:44.870 --> 02:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh well i'm going to work down the road
 
02:15:46.870 --> 02:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
don't worry i'll tell you i i just want
 
02:15:49.910 --> 02:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
to emphasize uh that in fact what uh
 
02:15:49.920 --> 02:15:51.109 align:start position:0%
to emphasize uh that in fact what uh
representative

02:15:51.109 --> 02:15:51.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:15:51.119 --> 02:15:52.069 align:start position:0%
representative
mentioned

02:15:52.069 --> 02:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
02:15:54.390 --> 02:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
a medical intervention is providing
 
02:15:54.400 --> 02:15:55.510 align:start position:0%
a medical intervention is providing
lunch

02:15:55.510 --> 02:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
lunch
 
02:15:57.109 --> 02:15:57.119 align:start position:0%
and so and
 
02:15:58.709 --> 02:15:58.719 align:start position:0%
technically we would have to get
 
02:16:03.270 --> 02:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:07.350 --> 02:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:09.430 --> 02:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to respond to um
 
02:16:10.629 --> 02:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
representative gay thank you for
 
02:16:13.430 --> 02:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
understanding what i'm talking about
 
02:16:14.950 --> 02:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
there's actually a
 
02:16:16.870 --> 02:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
relatively small set of parents that
 
02:16:16.880 --> 02:16:18.629 align:start position:0%
relatively small set of parents that
don't

02:16:18.629 --> 02:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
don't
 
02:16:21.430 --> 02:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
provide parental oversight it depends
 
02:16:22.870 --> 02:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
upon the community depends upon the
 
02:16:24.870 --> 02:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
economic status and so forth etc i
 
02:16:26.229 --> 02:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
cannot share with you folks some of the
 
02:16:29.189 --> 02:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
stories my wife brought home from school
 
02:16:31.430 --> 02:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
but there are many parents out there who
 
02:16:33.589 --> 02:16:33.599 align:start position:0%
are very neglectful
 
02:16:35.910 --> 02:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately we have to have a
 
02:16:37.589 --> 02:16:37.599 align:start position:0%
backstop with those parents because
 
02:16:39.589 --> 02:16:39.599 align:start position:0%
those children are critical
 
02:16:43.270 --> 02:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
and to chairman pearson's point of view
 
02:16:44.709 --> 02:16:44.719 align:start position:0%
they don't always pay attention to the
 
02:16:46.950 --> 02:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
medical community they don't even take
 
02:16:48.870 --> 02:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
the children to the physician they don't
 
02:16:51.429 --> 02:16:51.439 align:start position:0%
even get wellness visits
 
02:16:52.870 --> 02:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
what do we do with them we have to
 
02:16:54.950 --> 02:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
somehow protect them
 
02:16:57.190 --> 02:16:57.200 align:start position:0%
from the neglect of a parent in having
 
02:16:58.709 --> 02:16:58.719 align:start position:0%
that point in time
 
02:17:01.990 --> 02:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
having a school nurse who's been trained
 
02:17:03.509 --> 02:17:03.519 align:start position:0%
to do the screenings
 
02:17:05.750 --> 02:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
this is not somebody's a teacher this is
 
02:17:08.389 --> 02:17:08.399 align:start position:0%
a school nurse who's gone to school
 
02:17:10.150 --> 02:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
most likely for four years who's been
 
02:17:12.309 --> 02:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
accredited as a school nurse who
 
02:17:14.629 --> 02:17:14.639 align:start position:0%
understands how to deal with a child
 
02:17:16.549 --> 02:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
so we're not talking about just anyone
 
02:17:17.910 --> 02:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
in the school building doing the
 
02:17:19.349 --> 02:17:19.359 align:start position:0%
screenings we're talking about people
 
02:17:21.750 --> 02:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
who are relatively trained to do it so
 
02:17:23.830 --> 02:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
i'm advocating for those
 
02:17:23.840 --> 02:17:24.790 align:start position:0%
i'm advocating for those
children

02:17:24.790 --> 02:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:17:27.110 --> 02:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
who don't have parents the way we think
 
02:17:28.389 --> 02:17:28.399 align:start position:0%
of parents today
 
02:17:30.309 --> 02:17:30.319 align:start position:0%
and help protect them thank you
 
02:17:32.870 --> 02:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
02:17:35.270 --> 02:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um
 
02:17:37.349 --> 02:17:37.359 align:start position:0%
this is a question i'm not sure if this
 
02:17:40.389 --> 02:17:40.399 align:start position:0%
is intentionally left out or purposely
 
02:17:41.830 --> 02:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
left out
 
02:17:43.589 --> 02:17:43.599 align:start position:0%
but one issue
 
02:17:46.389 --> 02:17:46.399 align:start position:0%
that i'm thinking of is that
 
02:17:46.399 --> 02:17:48.309 align:start position:0%
that i'm thinking of is that
currently

02:17:48.309 --> 02:17:48.319 align:start position:0%
currently
 
02:17:51.110 --> 02:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
children at the age of 14 are able to
 
02:17:52.870 --> 02:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
consent to
 
02:17:55.270 --> 02:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
sexually transmitted disease treatment
 
02:17:56.950 --> 02:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
and diagnosis
 
02:17:58.629 --> 02:17:58.639 align:start position:0%
i think that's probably irrelevant
 
02:18:00.389 --> 02:18:00.399 align:start position:0%
because i don't know of any schools that
 
02:18:03.750 --> 02:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
have like a clinic within the school
 
02:18:05.589 --> 02:18:05.599 align:start position:0%
although that's possible but i don't
 
02:18:07.030 --> 02:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
know of any in new hampshire that have
 
02:18:11.509 --> 02:18:11.519 align:start position:0%
that but in regard to substance use
 
02:18:15.110 --> 02:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:15.120 --> 02:18:16.309 align:start position:0%
 
prevention

02:18:16.309 --> 02:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
prevention
 
02:18:18.469 --> 02:18:18.479 align:start position:0%
there are many many schools that have
 
02:18:21.030 --> 02:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
people who provide those services in the
 
02:18:21.040 --> 02:18:22.070 align:start position:0%
people who provide those services in the
school

02:18:22.070 --> 02:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:18:25.270 --> 02:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:18:26.549 --> 02:18:26.559 align:start position:0%
state law
 
02:18:29.270 --> 02:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
and i think federally also um those
 
02:18:30.870 --> 02:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
people are allowed those
 
02:18:32.870 --> 02:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
children minors are allowed to consent
 
02:18:34.629 --> 02:18:34.639 align:start position:0%
at the age of 12.
 
02:18:38.389 --> 02:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
um so this the way this is written it
 
02:18:40.389 --> 02:18:40.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any exception for those
 
02:18:42.309 --> 02:18:42.319 align:start position:0%
kind of services that happen in schools
 
02:18:43.990 --> 02:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
and maybe that's intentional maybe you
 
02:18:45.669 --> 02:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
don't feel like those should be provided
 
02:18:47.349 --> 02:18:47.359 align:start position:0%
in schools but
 
02:18:50.230 --> 02:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
that would have an enormous impact
 
02:18:53.110 --> 02:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
on the schools as they exist today and
 
02:18:56.549 --> 02:18:56.559 align:start position:0%
what they offer today and also on the
 
02:18:56.559 --> 02:18:58.709 align:start position:0%
what they offer today and also on the
um

02:18:58.709 --> 02:18:58.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:00.870 --> 02:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
changing the access to
 
02:19:02.950 --> 02:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder
 
02:19:02.960 --> 02:19:06.629 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
02:19:12.230 --> 02:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
i just had a quick
 
02:19:14.230 --> 02:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
answer to the concern about the child
 
02:19:17.110 --> 02:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
with sensory issues which is a very real
 
02:19:17.120 --> 02:19:18.469 align:start position:0%
with sensory issues which is a very real
concern

02:19:18.469 --> 02:19:18.479 align:start position:0%
concern
 
02:19:21.270 --> 02:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
first of all as representative merchants
 
02:19:23.990 --> 02:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
said a trained professional is going to
 
02:19:26.549 --> 02:19:26.559 align:start position:0%
take those into account in performing a
 
02:19:27.910 --> 02:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
screening and it may be that the
 
02:19:29.509 --> 02:19:29.519 align:start position:0%
screening can't be performed for good
 
02:19:31.190 --> 02:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
and sufficient reason because it would
 
02:19:33.509 --> 02:19:33.519 align:start position:0%
cause way more harm than it would
 
02:19:36.070 --> 02:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
but the other remedy for that is that
 
02:19:38.870 --> 02:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
the parent who is concerned about their
 
02:19:38.880 --> 02:19:39.990 align:start position:0%
the parent who is concerned about their
child

02:19:39.990 --> 02:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
child
 
02:19:42.150 --> 02:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
writes a note as my mother did at the
 
02:19:45.030 --> 02:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
beginning of every single school year
 
02:19:48.389 --> 02:19:48.399 align:start position:0%
which said lucy is not to drink whole
 
02:19:48.399 --> 02:19:50.630 align:start position:0%
which said lucy is not to drink whole
milk

02:19:50.630 --> 02:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
milk
 
02:19:53.110 --> 02:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
so i didn't i wasn't actually allergic
 
02:19:55.270 --> 02:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
to it but i hated it so much that i
 
02:19:59.030 --> 02:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
could blow my cookies every single time
 
02:20:01.510 --> 02:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
and i had any number of people who
 
02:20:03.190 --> 02:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
thought they were going to teach me to
 
02:20:05.910 --> 02:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
drink milk and they were all wrong but
 
02:20:08.950 --> 02:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
my mother wrote a note and so if a
 
02:20:11.990 --> 02:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
parent is concerned about a particular
 
02:20:13.830 --> 02:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
approach to their child which is
 
02:20:16.309 --> 02:20:16.319 align:start position:0%
inappropriate for their child they write
 
02:20:19.270 --> 02:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
a note and say don't do it
 
02:20:21.349 --> 02:20:21.359 align:start position:0%
now this side of the room anybody
 
02:20:23.190 --> 02:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
02:20:24.950 --> 02:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:20:27.110 --> 02:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
so anything that is done to children in
 
02:20:29.590 --> 02:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
schools i think that is not educational
 
02:20:31.750 --> 02:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
and isn't part of what parents expect to
 
02:20:33.590 --> 02:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
be happening to their kids needs to have
 
02:20:35.750 --> 02:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
consent there is no reason that this
 
02:20:37.830 --> 02:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
can't be part of the beginning of the
 
02:20:39.670 --> 02:20:39.680 align:start position:0%
year packet that goes out and the
 
02:20:41.830 --> 02:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
parents sign all the forms and if they
 
02:20:44.309 --> 02:20:44.319 align:start position:0%
see the form and they say oh my child
 
02:20:46.550 --> 02:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have this dental screening we
 
02:20:49.190 --> 02:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
we you know for whatever reason i don't
 
02:20:50.630 --> 02:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
want them to have it they should have
 
02:20:52.710 --> 02:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
that right we can't punish or take away
 
02:20:52.720 --> 02:20:53.590 align:start position:0%
that right we can't punish or take away
rights

02:20:53.590 --> 02:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
rights
 
02:20:56.550 --> 02:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
from parents just because we can't
 
02:20:58.710 --> 02:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
hear what's going on here please because
 
02:20:59.830 --> 02:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
of a small
 
02:21:01.910 --> 02:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
percentage of people who would abuse
 
02:21:03.910 --> 02:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
that right and if they are medically
 
02:21:07.030 --> 02:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
neglectful then they should be have
 
02:21:09.670 --> 02:21:09.680 align:start position:0%
child protective services involved and
 
02:21:12.230 --> 02:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
the schools can pay attention and and
 
02:21:14.790 --> 02:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
make that decision to report if it comes
 
02:21:15.750 --> 02:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
to that
 
02:21:17.830 --> 02:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
but at the beginning of the year to have
 
02:21:20.710 --> 02:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
a form in the packet that goes out
 
02:21:23.110 --> 02:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not a huge ask and it
 
02:21:26.790 --> 02:21:26.800 align:start position:0%
ensures that parental rights are honored
 
02:21:32.150 --> 02:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:34.950 --> 02:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
okay representative snow
 
02:21:37.270 --> 02:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i just the
 
02:21:39.349 --> 02:21:39.359 align:start position:0%
personal story my wife
 
02:21:40.950 --> 02:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
who grew up in a very middle-class
 
02:21:43.750 --> 02:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
family with very caring parents
 
02:21:46.389 --> 02:21:46.399 align:start position:0%
and she when she was in school in first
 
02:21:47.990 --> 02:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
and second grade
 
02:21:49.270 --> 02:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
realized that she had to sit in the
 
02:21:50.630 --> 02:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
front row because she couldn't see
 
02:21:52.950 --> 02:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
anything on the blackboard unless she
 
02:21:54.469 --> 02:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
sat in the front row and went up and
 
02:21:54.479 --> 02:21:55.349 align:start position:0%
sat in the front row and went up and
that

02:21:55.349 --> 02:21:55.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:21:57.750 --> 02:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
and the parents had no real inkling that
 
02:21:59.429 --> 02:21:59.439 align:start position:0%
anything was wrong because the report
 
02:22:01.030 --> 02:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
was never done
 
02:22:03.190 --> 02:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
she had a screening and a school nurse
 
02:22:05.270 --> 02:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
one day came knocking on the front door
 
02:22:06.550 --> 02:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
of their house
 
02:22:08.950 --> 02:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
and said you need to take your daughter
 
02:22:11.429 --> 02:22:11.439 align:start position:0%
to an eye doctor she really has a
 
02:22:11.439 --> 02:22:12.469 align:start position:0%
to an eye doctor she really has a
deficient

02:22:12.469 --> 02:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
deficient
 
02:22:14.469 --> 02:22:14.479 align:start position:0%
vision the mother was very embarrassed
 
02:22:16.550 --> 02:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
they immediately took it she's worn
 
02:22:18.309 --> 02:22:18.319 align:start position:0%
glasses ever since
 
02:22:19.510 --> 02:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
and thank the lord they did the
 
02:22:19.520 --> 02:22:20.710 align:start position:0%
and thank the lord they did the
screening

02:22:20.710 --> 02:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
screening
 
02:22:22.070 --> 02:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
i remember she tried out for the
 
02:22:23.510 --> 02:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
softball team
 
02:22:25.750 --> 02:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
never did see a ball in the air she said
 
02:22:27.590 --> 02:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
she just swung and hoped somehow she
 
02:22:29.590 --> 02:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
came within close proximity
 
02:22:32.150 --> 02:22:32.160 align:start position:0%
but i i think in many cases
 
02:22:34.630 --> 02:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
and i think to have those forms put in
 
02:22:34.640 --> 02:22:35.510 align:start position:0%
and i think to have those forms put in
the

02:22:35.510 --> 02:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:22:37.190 --> 02:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
in the folder at the beginning of the
 
02:22:37.200 --> 02:22:37.990 align:start position:0%
in the folder at the beginning of the
year

02:22:37.990 --> 02:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:22:40.630 --> 02:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
those same parents that don't do it are
 
02:22:42.389 --> 02:22:42.399 align:start position:0%
not going to sign those forms either so
 
02:22:44.469 --> 02:22:44.479 align:start position:0%
the people that need the screening
 
02:22:46.550 --> 02:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
the most but there are people from
 
02:22:48.870 --> 02:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
families like my wife's family
 
02:22:50.870 --> 02:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
who benefited greatly from having that
 
02:22:53.190 --> 02:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
screening and done
 
02:22:56.950 --> 02:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:00.389 --> 02:23:00.399 align:start position:0%
i have a story his name is eddie
 
02:23:01.830 --> 02:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
and we all knew eddie was deaf his
 
02:23:03.670 --> 02:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
parents didn't
 
02:23:06.070 --> 02:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
and one day eddie got the hearing test
 
02:23:06.080 --> 02:23:07.349 align:start position:0%
and one day eddie got the hearing test
screening

02:23:07.349 --> 02:23:07.359 align:start position:0%
screening
 
02:23:09.590 --> 02:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
that we all did
 
02:23:11.910 --> 02:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
and a note went home
 
02:23:13.510 --> 02:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
you ought to go get your kids
 
02:23:13.520 --> 02:23:16.710 align:start position:0%
you ought to go get your kids
professionally

02:23:16.710 --> 02:23:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:18.630 --> 02:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
ear hearing
 
02:23:21.270 --> 02:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
we don't think he can hear
 
02:23:23.910 --> 02:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
and the parents weren't bad they weren't
 
02:23:23.920 --> 02:23:25.510 align:start position:0%
and the parents weren't bad they weren't
angry

02:23:25.510 --> 02:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
angry
 
02:23:27.429 --> 02:23:27.439 align:start position:0%
they were just clueless
 
02:23:29.670 --> 02:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
until the note went home
 
02:23:31.670 --> 02:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
and eddie was fitted up with hearing
 
02:23:33.270 --> 02:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
aids and
 
02:23:34.950 --> 02:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
he could finally hear the teacher and do
 
02:23:36.790 --> 02:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
better in school
 
02:23:38.550 --> 02:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
that was the screening
 
02:23:41.270 --> 02:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
they didn't the school didn't make him
 
02:23:43.670 --> 02:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
get hearing aids the school sent home a
 
02:23:43.680 --> 02:23:44.630 align:start position:0%
get hearing aids the school sent home a
note

02:23:44.630 --> 02:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
note
 
02:23:46.389 --> 02:23:46.399 align:start position:0%
saying this is something we in the
 
02:23:48.870 --> 02:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
learning process
 
02:23:51.830 --> 02:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
you'd send your kids to school to learn
 
02:23:54.070 --> 02:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
if they're not learning why is that
 
02:23:57.750 --> 02:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
there's a diagnostic thing for dyslexia
 
02:23:59.110 --> 02:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
is that invasive
 
02:24:01.590 --> 02:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
no johnny can't read why is that
 
02:24:01.600 --> 02:24:03.670 align:start position:0%
no johnny can't read why is that
screenings

02:24:03.670 --> 02:24:03.680 align:start position:0%
screenings
 
02:24:05.270 --> 02:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
not treatments
 
02:24:07.349 --> 02:24:07.359 align:start position:0%
so another hand representative
 
02:24:12.070 --> 02:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:15.030 --> 02:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
so let me ask our parliamentarian
 
02:24:17.030 --> 02:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
the protocol here i was under the
 
02:24:17.040 --> 02:24:18.469 align:start position:0%
the protocol here i was under the
impression

02:24:18.469 --> 02:24:18.479 align:start position:0%
impression
 
02:24:21.750 --> 02:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
um if an amendment is adopted and then
 
02:24:24.150 --> 02:24:24.160 align:start position:0%
the next amendment is adopted and both
 
02:24:26.870 --> 02:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
replace of the same thing the first one
 
02:24:29.190 --> 02:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
goes away i want to do this right and
 
02:24:33.510 --> 02:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:36.230 --> 02:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
what normally happens is each person
 
02:24:38.710 --> 02:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
decides which amendment that they
 
02:24:41.030 --> 02:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
appre approve
 
02:24:43.270 --> 02:24:43.280 align:start position:0%
they're competing amendments
 
02:24:46.550 --> 02:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
each of us has one we prefer
 
02:24:46.560 --> 02:24:47.750 align:start position:0%
each of us has one we prefer
if

02:24:47.750 --> 02:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:24:50.230 --> 02:24:50.240 align:start position:0%
each of us decides which one we prefer
 
02:24:53.349 --> 02:24:53.359 align:start position:0%
and vote yes or not to pass on that and
 
02:24:55.270 --> 02:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
no on
 
02:24:58.230 --> 02:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
itl on the ones they want to keep
 
02:25:00.710 --> 02:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
it comes out right because we should not
 
02:25:02.630 --> 02:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
be voting for two
 
02:25:04.550 --> 02:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
voting the same way for two amendments
 
02:25:06.630 --> 02:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
if the amendments are competing what
 
02:25:09.270 --> 02:25:09.280 align:start position:0%
i've seen happening in the if it happens
 
02:25:10.950 --> 02:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
i don't know what happens i suppose the
 
02:25:13.750 --> 02:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
last in time controls but
 
02:25:17.110 --> 02:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
my concern is
 
02:25:19.510 --> 02:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
i don't see why anybody would vote yes
 
02:25:21.910 --> 02:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
on two different competing amendments
 
02:25:24.150 --> 02:25:24.160 align:start position:0%
what we have done at some points in the
 
02:25:24.160 --> 02:25:25.270 align:start position:0%
what we have done at some points in the
past

02:25:25.270 --> 02:25:25.280 align:start position:0%
past
 
02:25:29.030 --> 02:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
is we've had an amendment that amends
 
02:25:31.590 --> 02:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
the first paragraph of a bill and
 
02:25:33.190 --> 02:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
everybody agreed that that made the bill
 
02:25:34.870 --> 02:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
better and then we've had a second
 
02:25:37.990 --> 02:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
amendment that changes paragraph 12 of
 
02:25:40.550 --> 02:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
the bill and everybody like that and ols
 
02:25:42.550 --> 02:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
can just put those two together into a
 
02:25:44.309 --> 02:25:44.319 align:start position:0%
committee amendment at the end but we
 
02:25:46.790 --> 02:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
have before us i would urge people to
 
02:25:46.800 --> 02:25:47.670 align:start position:0%
have before us i would urge people to
vote

02:25:47.670 --> 02:25:47.680 align:start position:0%
vote
 
02:25:49.910 --> 02:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
ought to pass an itl rather than not to
 
02:25:52.309 --> 02:25:52.319 align:start position:0%
pass on everything because that's way
 
02:25:54.150 --> 02:25:54.160 align:start position:0%
lies so if i
 
02:25:56.630 --> 02:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
understand i could ask and it doesn't
 
02:25:58.230 --> 02:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
matter which order
 
02:26:01.190 --> 02:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
representative merchant will move otp
 
02:26:02.950 --> 02:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
and then we'll count the votes and then
 
02:26:04.870 --> 02:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
representative cushman or in the other
 
02:26:07.990 --> 02:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
order would move otp and
 
02:26:09.990 --> 02:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
02:26:13.110 --> 02:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
yeah on the amendment each amendment and
 
02:26:15.270 --> 02:26:15.280 align:start position:0%
those who want representative cushmans
 
02:26:17.590 --> 02:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
would write yeah do yes and we hope one
 
02:26:19.429 --> 02:26:19.439 align:start position:0%
would come out one way and one would
 
02:26:21.830 --> 02:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
come out the other yes
 
02:26:23.990 --> 02:26:24.000 align:start position:0%

02:34:53.190 --> 02:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
yes i would um
 
02:34:55.750 --> 02:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
also suggest that we itl this bill i
 
02:34:56.830 --> 02:34:56.840 align:start position:0%
think that
 
02:35:01.510 --> 02:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
um we're best off when consensus drives
 
02:35:04.710 --> 02:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
law making and um not when lawmaking
 
02:35:07.030 --> 02:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
drives consensus and um
 
02:35:09.190 --> 02:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
as indicated by the sign ins and as
 
02:35:11.429 --> 02:35:11.439 align:start position:0%
indicated by a lot of controversy about
 
02:35:13.429 --> 02:35:13.439 align:start position:0%
this we don't have a consensus on this
 
02:35:13.439 --> 02:35:14.309 align:start position:0%
this we don't have a consensus on this
issue

02:35:14.309 --> 02:35:14.319 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:35:16.070 --> 02:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
so i think we should
 
02:35:18.230 --> 02:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
itl the bill
 
02:35:24.630 --> 02:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:27.270 --> 02:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
great idea thank you i was thinking of
 
02:35:27.280 --> 02:35:29.910 align:start position:0%
great idea thank you i was thinking of
that

02:35:29.910 --> 02:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:29.920 --> 02:35:31.110 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:35:31.110 --> 02:35:31.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:35:33.830 --> 02:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
we are going to vote

exec session
 
02:37:01.270 --> 02:37:01.280 align:start position:0%

session on 1044
 
02:37:10.150 --> 02:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
and this is kind of uh
 
02:37:12.469 --> 02:37:12.479 align:start position:0%
what astronomers call a binary star as
 
02:37:15.190 --> 02:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
it eventually evolved they rotate around

uh amendment
 
02:40:32.479 --> 02:40:35.990 align:start position:0%
uh amendment
22-0

02:40:35.990 --> 02:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:38.230 align:start position:0%
 
this

02:40:38.230 --> 02:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:40:41.349 --> 02:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
so we weren't sure on the um
 
02:40:43.990 --> 02:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
what kind of model but we are sure that
 
02:40:46.309 --> 02:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
we need an alternative option for health
 
02:40:48.870 --> 02:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
care in new hampshire so
 
02:40:50.950 --> 02:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
it includes membership based business
 
02:40:50.960 --> 02:40:51.990 align:start position:0%
it includes membership based business
models

02:40:51.990 --> 02:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
models
 
02:40:53.990 --> 02:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment does and
 
02:40:58.950 --> 02:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:01.830 --> 02:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
it also we needed to incorporate
 
02:41:03.269 --> 02:41:03.279 align:start position:0%
something into the patient bill of
 
02:41:05.510 --> 02:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
rights because as it stands the patient
 
02:41:07.590 --> 02:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
bill of rights for medical facilities
 
02:41:10.630 --> 02:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
licensed under 151
 
02:41:12.710 --> 02:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
colon 2
 
02:41:16.309 --> 02:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
it has a few mentions of medicare and
 
02:41:18.389 --> 02:41:18.399 align:start position:0%
medicaid and
 
02:41:18.399 --> 02:41:21.030 align:start position:0%
medicaid and
not

02:41:21.030 --> 02:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:23.670 --> 02:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
not discharging based on
 
02:41:26.070 --> 02:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
source of payment so those obviously
 
02:41:27.910 --> 02:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't apply to these direct payment
 
02:41:30.550 --> 02:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
and membership based business model
 
02:41:30.560 --> 02:41:31.750 align:start position:0%
and membership based business model
facilities

02:41:31.750 --> 02:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
02:41:31.760 --> 02:41:32.550 align:start position:0%
facilities
so

02:41:32.550 --> 02:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:41:34.389 --> 02:41:34.399 align:start position:0%
similar to the home health
 
02:41:34.399 --> 02:41:37.429 align:start position:0%
similar to the home health
agency

02:41:37.429 --> 02:41:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:38.950 --> 02:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
bill of rights
 
02:41:40.710 --> 02:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
they are exempt from
 
02:41:40.720 --> 02:41:40.890 align:start position:0%
they are exempt from
the

02:41:40.890 --> 02:41:40.900 align:start position:0%
the

the
[Music]

02:41:42.070 --> 02:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:41:43.590 --> 02:41:43.600 align:start position:0%
current patient bill of rights for
 
02:41:45.590 --> 02:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
medical facilities and have their own
 
02:41:47.830 --> 02:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
bill of rights which is is exactly the
 
02:41:51.349 --> 02:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
same except it removes those five lines
 
02:41:53.510 --> 02:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
that have to do with medicare medicaid
 
02:41:58.309 --> 02:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:04.389 --> 02:42:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:07.510 --> 02:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
thank you and um
 
02:42:07.520 --> 02:42:08.469 align:start position:0%
thank you and um
having

02:42:08.469 --> 02:42:08.479 align:start position:0%
having
 
02:42:10.710 --> 02:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
looked at it i understand the need for
 
02:42:13.670 --> 02:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
the difference there but i am
 
02:42:16.710 --> 02:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
first of all very concerned that this
 
02:42:21.110 --> 02:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
bill which was only originally about
 
02:42:21.120 --> 02:42:22.070 align:start position:0%
bill which was only originally about
uh

02:42:22.070 --> 02:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:42:24.469 --> 02:42:24.479 align:start position:0%
payment for
 
02:42:27.510 --> 02:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
a facility that operates on a membership
 
02:42:27.520 --> 02:42:29.190 align:start position:0%
a facility that operates on a membership
basis

02:42:29.190 --> 02:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
basis
 
02:42:31.110 --> 02:42:31.120 align:start position:0%
suddenly we are incorporating the
 
02:42:33.750 --> 02:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
patient's bill of rights and that was
 
02:42:35.510 --> 02:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
something that was done with no notice
 
02:42:37.910 --> 02:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
to the public or operators of a facility
 
02:42:39.670 --> 02:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
that might want to operate under these
 
02:42:42.070 --> 02:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
things and i'm not at all
 
02:42:44.230 --> 02:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
sure that it's a germane amendment to
 
02:42:45.830 --> 02:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
begin with
 
02:42:47.590 --> 02:42:47.600 align:start position:0%
it troubles me that there has been no
 
02:42:49.750 --> 02:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity for public comment on it in
 
02:42:51.110 --> 02:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
any case
 
02:42:55.510 --> 02:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
but i think that the concerns that
 
02:42:57.750 --> 02:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
a number of people expressed on a
 
02:43:00.870 --> 02:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
membership basis business model
 
02:43:03.510 --> 02:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
continue to be
 
02:43:05.030 --> 02:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
i mean i think the drafting may be a
 
02:43:07.110 --> 02:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
little better than than the original
 
02:43:08.790 --> 02:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
drafting but i think that the concerns
 
02:43:10.790 --> 02:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
of the people who opposed the original
 
02:43:10.800 --> 02:43:11.910 align:start position:0%
of the people who opposed the original
bill

02:43:11.910 --> 02:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:43:13.750 --> 02:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
are still going to
 
02:43:15.510 --> 02:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
hold good for this
 
02:43:18.150 --> 02:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
these are the sorts of
 
02:43:21.190 --> 02:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
facilities that siphon off
 
02:43:23.670 --> 02:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
patients who can pay from facilities
 
02:43:27.110 --> 02:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
that are operating on the edge and
 
02:43:28.630 --> 02:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
i think that that
 
02:43:29.990 --> 02:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
given that we
 
02:43:32.230 --> 02:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
can't change the whole thing right now i
 
02:43:34.389 --> 02:43:34.399 align:start position:0%
think it's fine that somebody wants to
 
02:43:36.469 --> 02:43:36.479 align:start position:0%
operate on a membership-based business
 
02:43:37.750 --> 02:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
model but i think they ought to be
 
02:43:39.510 --> 02:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
subject to the same rules as everybody
 
02:43:41.030 --> 02:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
else so i'm
 
02:43:43.429 --> 02:43:43.439 align:start position:0%
opposed to the amendment and opposed to
 
02:43:43.439 --> 02:43:46.550 align:start position:0%
opposed to the amendment and opposed to
the

02:43:46.550 --> 02:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:50.790 --> 02:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
underlying bill representative merchant
 
02:43:52.870 --> 02:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:43:54.950 --> 02:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
the other concern i have in here there's
 
02:43:57.670 --> 02:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
no requirement for them to submit data
 
02:43:58.950 --> 02:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
to the new hampshire department of
 
02:43:58.960 --> 02:43:59.910 align:start position:0%
to the new hampshire department of
health

02:43:59.910 --> 02:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
health
 
02:44:01.750 --> 02:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
so the department of insurance to
 
02:44:03.910 --> 02:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
provide transparency
 
02:44:06.150 --> 02:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
all the other facilities are going to be
 
02:44:08.710 --> 02:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
required to do that number two
 
02:44:10.630 --> 02:44:10.640 align:start position:0%
when you look at things today a patient
 
02:44:12.550 --> 02:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
can actually go on site
 
02:44:15.269 --> 02:44:15.279 align:start position:0%
and find the cash payment
 
02:44:17.510 --> 02:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
by any facility for any service they
 
02:44:19.269 --> 02:44:19.279 align:start position:0%
provide including by the way dental
 
02:44:19.279 --> 02:44:20.790 align:start position:0%
provide including by the way dental
services

02:44:20.790 --> 02:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:44:22.469 --> 02:44:22.479 align:start position:0%
is an interesting site to go to it's
 
02:44:24.630 --> 02:44:24.640 align:start position:0%
very robust has a tremendous amount of
 
02:44:26.710 --> 02:44:26.720 align:start position:0%
data there so a patient today can
 
02:44:26.720 --> 02:44:28.150 align:start position:0%
data there so a patient today can
actually

02:44:28.150 --> 02:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:44:29.910 --> 02:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
be proactive
 
02:44:31.910 --> 02:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
look at what the procedure is if they
 
02:44:33.830 --> 02:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
have a high deductible and decide where
 
02:44:35.670 --> 02:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
they want to get it done
 
02:44:37.990 --> 02:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
so therefore i think we already have
 
02:44:41.030 --> 02:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
free market competition in this market
 
02:44:43.429 --> 02:44:43.439 align:start position:0%
today i support free market i think it's
 
02:44:45.830 --> 02:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
the way we always try to bring
 
02:44:47.910 --> 02:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
transparency and pricing down but i
 
02:44:49.670 --> 02:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
believe today we have a system in place
 
02:44:52.309 --> 02:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
that is in fact very transparent
 
02:44:54.230 --> 02:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
that the patients can utilize
 
02:44:56.309 --> 02:44:56.319 align:start position:0%
and to their advantage and therefore
 
02:44:58.710 --> 02:44:58.720 align:start position:0%
once we educate them on how to do that
 
02:45:00.469 --> 02:45:00.479 align:start position:0%
we actually in
 
02:45:02.230 --> 02:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
fact open up competition in the
 
02:45:03.910 --> 02:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
marketplace because we educate patients
 
02:45:07.990 --> 02:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:09.750 --> 02:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
02:45:11.269 --> 02:45:11.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:45:13.429 --> 02:45:13.439 align:start position:0%
representative merchant first
 
02:45:15.110 --> 02:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
you're incorrect that they do not have
 
02:45:18.389 --> 02:45:18.399 align:start position:0%
to submit information to the department
 
02:45:20.469 --> 02:45:20.479 align:start position:0%
this bill only
 
02:45:20.479 --> 02:45:22.070 align:start position:0%
this bill only
alters

02:45:22.070 --> 02:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
alters
 
02:45:27.510 --> 02:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
section paragraph 1 of 151 colon 2
 
02:45:29.670 --> 02:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
dash f
 
02:45:29.680 --> 02:45:30.710 align:start position:0%
dash f
and

02:45:30.710 --> 02:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:45:33.510 --> 02:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
the relevant pieces that you're talking
 
02:45:35.670 --> 02:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
about are in
 
02:45:37.750 --> 02:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
a different section of the law they are
 
02:45:37.760 --> 02:45:43.030 align:start position:0%
a different section of the law they are
in

02:45:43.030 --> 02:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:53.190 --> 02:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:56.389 --> 02:45:56.399 align:start position:0%
i'm in the wrong section i'm sorry
 
02:45:58.469 --> 02:45:58.479 align:start position:0%
here it is uh section two they must
 
02:46:00.389 --> 02:46:00.399 align:start position:0%
adopt publicize and apply assistance
 
02:46:01.670 --> 02:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
plan so they still have to have
 
02:46:04.389 --> 02:46:04.399 align:start position:0%
assistance plans um this is rep mark
 
02:46:06.710 --> 02:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
mclean's bill and it never altered that
 
02:46:09.670 --> 02:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
requirement um they also need to in
 
02:46:12.550 --> 02:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
paragraph three of that section of of
 
02:46:14.309 --> 02:46:14.319 align:start position:0%
the rsa is they need to provide data to
 
02:46:15.830 --> 02:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of the department of
 
02:46:17.190 --> 02:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
health and human services regarding the
 
02:46:19.190 --> 02:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
volume cost and outcomes of services
 
02:46:21.269 --> 02:46:21.279 align:start position:0%
provided in the facilities and they need
 
02:46:24.469 --> 02:46:24.479 align:start position:0%
to pay the fees um for licensing
 
02:46:26.710 --> 02:46:26.720 align:start position:0%
so they still do have to do everything
 
02:46:29.510 --> 02:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
that other facilities have to do except
 
02:46:33.190 --> 02:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
take all forms of payment and we've seen
 
02:46:35.429 --> 02:46:35.439 align:start position:0%
that the requirement to accept all forms
 
02:46:39.110 --> 02:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
of payment has become very onerous and
 
02:46:42.550 --> 02:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:45.190 --> 02:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
cms is included in that and we have seen
 
02:46:47.269 --> 02:46:47.279 align:start position:0%
mandates and regulations that many
 
02:46:48.950 --> 02:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
businesses do not agree with many
 
02:46:50.550 --> 02:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
consumers do not agree with and
 
02:46:52.150 --> 02:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
currently in new hampshire there are no
 
02:46:54.950 --> 02:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
alternative options and we need to allow
 
02:46:57.429 --> 02:46:57.439 align:start position:0%
for those options to spring up let the
 
02:46:59.910 --> 02:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
market work because right now it is a
 
02:47:02.389 --> 02:47:02.399 align:start position:0%
closed market that is only open to those
 
02:47:06.150 --> 02:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
who accept cms
 
02:47:08.230 --> 02:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
representative connerk
 
02:47:10.230 --> 02:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
um a couple of things i would like to
 
02:47:12.230 --> 02:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
echo what representative weber said
 
02:47:14.469 --> 02:47:14.479 align:start position:0%
before basically again
 
02:47:15.830 --> 02:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
particularly if we look at our critical
 
02:47:18.150 --> 02:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
access hospitals they function on razor
 
02:47:20.309 --> 02:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
thin margins
 
02:47:22.550 --> 02:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
the yes indeed there is cost shifting
 
02:47:25.030 --> 02:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
that's how they stay afloat you made
 
02:47:27.269 --> 02:47:27.279 align:start position:0%
representative cushman made a very good
 
02:47:28.950 --> 02:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
set of arguments when she presented
 
02:47:30.469 --> 02:47:30.479 align:start position:0%
about how broken her health care system
 
02:47:31.990 --> 02:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
is a good argument for why we need to
 
02:47:33.590 --> 02:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
reform it perhaps need a single-payer
 
02:47:33.600 --> 02:47:34.389 align:start position:0%
reform it perhaps need a single-payer
system

02:47:34.389 --> 02:47:34.399 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:47:36.070 --> 02:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
but this is not the way to do it because
 
02:47:38.710 --> 02:47:38.720 align:start position:0%
it simply will not work we can look back
 
02:47:41.510 --> 02:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
to a time when we did have a much a
 
02:47:43.830 --> 02:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
little bit more free market
 
02:47:45.990 --> 02:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
and older people couldn't get health
 
02:47:48.389 --> 02:47:48.399 align:start position:0%
care because who's going to who's going
 
02:47:50.469 --> 02:47:50.479 align:start position:0%
to insure somebody
 
02:47:52.710 --> 02:47:52.720 align:start position:0%
who is old and poor
 
02:47:55.110 --> 02:47:55.120 align:start position:0%
they're not a good risk or just poor
 
02:47:57.110 --> 02:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
because it's not going to work
 
02:47:59.670 --> 02:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
and that is why we had
 
02:48:01.910 --> 02:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
medicare and medicaid get formulated
 
02:48:03.510 --> 02:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
because it made more sense letting these
 
02:48:05.269 --> 02:48:05.279 align:start position:0%
people simply die in the streets which
 
02:48:07.190 --> 02:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
is what was happening
 
02:48:07.200 --> 02:48:08.230 align:start position:0%
is what was happening
now

02:48:08.230 --> 02:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:48:08.240 --> 02:48:09.510 align:start position:0%
now
this

02:48:09.510 --> 02:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:48:11.429 --> 02:48:11.439 align:start position:0%
is going to suction off
 
02:48:12.790 --> 02:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
siphon off
 
02:48:14.870 --> 02:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
the paying patients particularly from
 
02:48:16.950 --> 02:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
our critical access hospitals and we
 
02:48:19.269 --> 02:48:19.279 align:start position:0%
have seen closure of maternity wards
 
02:48:21.190 --> 02:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
because that's a that's a loss leader
 
02:48:22.230 --> 02:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
for them
 
02:48:24.389 --> 02:48:24.399 align:start position:0%
and they cannot afford to continue to do
 
02:48:24.399 --> 02:48:25.269 align:start position:0%
and they cannot afford to continue to do
it

02:48:25.269 --> 02:48:25.279 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:48:28.630 --> 02:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
uh the rate of births in uh
 
02:48:30.790 --> 02:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
by police increased on laconia when they
 
02:48:33.349 --> 02:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
closed their birthing center these are
 
02:48:35.429 --> 02:48:35.439 align:start position:0%
real impacts these are i live in a place
 
02:48:36.870 --> 02:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
where there's not a lot of choices for
 
02:48:38.309 --> 02:48:38.319 align:start position:0%
medical care
 
02:48:40.230 --> 02:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
and if you put a birthing center there
 
02:48:41.910 --> 02:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
it's gonna it's gonna close memorial
 
02:48:43.750 --> 02:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
hospital or it's to siphon off any of
 
02:48:44.790 --> 02:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
the ones that do pay and they're going
 
02:48:47.190 --> 02:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
to have to just drop it
 
02:48:49.269 --> 02:48:49.279 align:start position:0%
but i'm also very troubled by the fact
 
02:48:51.030 --> 02:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
that i think this is does have a great
 
02:48:52.790 --> 02:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
deal that's not germane it adds an
 
02:48:55.190 --> 02:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
enormous amount to this bill including a
 
02:48:58.230 --> 02:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
whole separate patient bill of rights
 
02:49:01.030 --> 02:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
for the
 
02:49:03.510 --> 02:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
direct pay and membership based
 
02:49:04.790 --> 02:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
and actually interestingly enough
 
02:49:06.230 --> 02:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
because of the fact you're describing
 
02:49:08.309 --> 02:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
that so to remove
 
02:49:08.319 --> 02:49:11.030 align:start position:0%
that so to remove
them

02:49:11.030 --> 02:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:15.590 --> 02:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:17.990 --> 02:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
the patient i should it's actually the
 
02:49:19.269 --> 02:49:19.279 align:start position:0%
point i'm getting at is there's a lot
 
02:49:20.550 --> 02:49:20.560 align:start position:0%
here to try to
 
02:49:22.870 --> 02:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
look at it's not a simple amendment on
 
02:49:24.469 --> 02:49:24.479 align:start position:0%
section five of the original bill of
 
02:49:24.479 --> 02:49:25.349 align:start position:0%
section five of the original bill of
rights

02:49:25.349 --> 02:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
rights
 
02:49:27.670 --> 02:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
it says that if you
 
02:49:29.190 --> 02:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
suddenly go on medicaid because perhaps
 
02:49:30.790 --> 02:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
you've spent down your assets which
 
02:49:32.710 --> 02:49:32.720 align:start position:0%
happens to many people they can just
 
02:49:34.469 --> 02:49:34.479 align:start position:0%
throw you out in the street
 
02:49:37.190 --> 02:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
unless you are required to take medicaid
 
02:49:38.550 --> 02:49:38.560 align:start position:0%
payment which is of course the major
 
02:49:42.950 --> 02:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:42.960 --> 02:49:44.469 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:49:44.469 --> 02:49:44.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:49:47.269 --> 02:49:47.279 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to see in your number five
 
02:49:50.070 --> 02:49:50.080 align:start position:0%
and the new bill of rights
 
02:49:52.389 --> 02:49:52.399 align:start position:0%
or for non-payment for the state patient
 
02:49:52.399 --> 02:49:54.950 align:start position:0%
or for non-payment for the state patient
stay

02:49:54.950 --> 02:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
stay
 
02:49:56.469 --> 02:49:56.479 align:start position:0%
so it says that the patient can be
 
02:49:56.479 --> 02:49:59.190 align:start position:0%
so it says that the patient can be
discharged

02:49:59.190 --> 02:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
discharged
 
02:50:01.269 --> 02:50:01.279 align:start position:0%
for non-payment of stay
 
02:50:02.870 --> 02:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
so and they don't accept medicare or
 
02:50:04.870 --> 02:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
medicaid so that means if a person now
 
02:50:06.870 --> 02:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
is spent down their assets
 
02:50:08.389 --> 02:50:08.399 align:start position:0%
they're in a nursing home we're going to
 
02:50:10.550 --> 02:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
throw them on the street
 
02:50:12.230 --> 02:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
so i would say that this bill goes
 
02:50:14.630 --> 02:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
beyond first of all siphoning off
 
02:50:16.230 --> 02:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
health care
 
02:50:18.710 --> 02:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
from our critical access hospitals
 
02:50:20.150 --> 02:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
leaving them to
 
02:50:22.469 --> 02:50:22.479 align:start position:0%
get into financial trouble to being just
 
02:50:28.550 --> 02:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:30.950 --> 02:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
we've just received an opinion from the
 
02:50:32.950 --> 02:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
clerk of the house that this amendment
 
02:50:34.790 --> 02:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
may not be germane
 
02:50:41.830 --> 02:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:43.429 --> 02:50:43.439 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if we need any further
 
02:50:45.030 --> 02:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
discussion on it
 
02:50:46.870 --> 02:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
well it's the speaker's purview so maybe
 
02:50:49.349 --> 02:50:49.359 align:start position:0%
we should ask him
 
02:50:49.359 --> 02:50:53.110 align:start position:0%
we should ask him
okay

02:50:53.110 --> 02:50:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:04.070 --> 02:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:05.830 --> 02:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
so if you could excuse me for a few
 
02:51:05.840 --> 02:51:22.150 align:start position:0%
so if you could excuse me for a few
minutes

02:51:22.150 --> 02:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:24.870 --> 02:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
so i don't tie you all up i'm going to
 
02:51:24.880 --> 02:51:27.510 align:start position:0%
so i don't tie you all up i'm going to
um

02:51:27.510 --> 02:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:27.520 --> 02:51:28.630 align:start position:0%
 
postpone

02:51:28.630 --> 02:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
postpone
 
02:51:30.389 --> 02:51:30.399 align:start position:0%
move close
 
02:51:33.830 --> 02:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
recess the hearing on this so over your
 
02:51:37.110 --> 02:51:37.120 align:start position:0%
lunch hour i can speak with the speaker
 
02:51:40.630 --> 02:51:40.640 align:start position:0%
this will be on 10 44 and probably
 
02:51:46.469 --> 02:51:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:48.950 --> 02:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
and uh just while i remember the
 
02:51:51.910 --> 02:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
information representative shapiro likes
 
02:51:53.349 --> 02:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
to know this
 
02:51:55.750 --> 02:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
two bits of information sign in on the
 
02:52:00.070 --> 02:52:00.080 align:start position:0%
original bill 1044 the number was 417-4
 
02:52:01.750 --> 02:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
and 3 against
 
02:52:04.389 --> 02:52:04.399 align:start position:0%
but a year ago when pretty similar to
 
02:52:07.910 --> 02:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
this came to here it was 18 to 3 itl so
 
02:52:09.349 --> 02:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
there's your numbers
 
02:52:11.190 --> 02:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
so i will deal with that over the lunch
 
02:52:11.200 --> 02:52:12.230 align:start position:0%
so i will deal with that over the lunch
hour

02:52:12.230 --> 02:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
hour
 
02:52:12.240 --> 02:52:13.349 align:start position:0%
hour
and

02:52:13.349 --> 02:52:13.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:52:13.359 --> 02:52:14.389 align:start position:0%
and
um

02:52:14.389 --> 02:52:14.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:16.630 --> 02:52:16.640 align:start position:0%
top of my stack here is
 
02:52:20.070 --> 02:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
open the hearing to uh the executive
 
02:52:20.080 --> 02:52:21.670 align:start position:0%

and
 
02:52:57.349 --> 02:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
uh somebody

has already
 
02:52:59.200 --> 02:53:00.150 align:start position:0%
has already
signed

02:53:00.150 --> 02:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
signed
 
02:53:02.790 --> 02:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
to do this so i uh the chair calls on
 
02:53:06.630 --> 02:53:06.640 align:start position:0%
representative erica leon for a motion
 
02:53:08.710 --> 02:53:08.720 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chairman i move and
 
02:53:10.950 --> 02:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate on house bill
 
02:53:13.990 --> 02:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
1481 and do i have a second
 
02:53:20.070 --> 02:53:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:22.150 --> 02:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:53:23.990 --> 02:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to repeal the
 
02:53:27.190 --> 02:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
protections that are in statute about
 
02:53:30.150 --> 02:53:30.160 align:start position:0%
people's choices around vaccination
 
02:53:33.190 --> 02:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
without informed consent
 
02:53:34.790 --> 02:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
treatments are
 
02:53:34.800 --> 02:53:36.309 align:start position:0%
treatments are
unethical

02:53:36.309 --> 02:53:36.319 align:start position:0%
unethical
 
02:53:38.389 --> 02:53:38.399 align:start position:0%
the what we need to do to increase
 
02:53:40.230 --> 02:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
vaccination rates is to convince people
 
02:53:41.510 --> 02:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
of the science the data and the
 
02:53:43.750 --> 02:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
protection not to coerce them by
 
02:53:46.309 --> 02:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
limiting their access to public public
 
02:53:49.030 --> 02:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
accommodations to schools or to any
 
02:53:50.550 --> 02:53:50.560 align:start position:0%
other services
 
02:53:53.349 --> 02:53:53.359 align:start position:0%
that is not the way to build public
 
02:53:56.469 --> 02:53:56.479 align:start position:0%
health to respect people's rights and to
 
02:53:56.479 --> 02:53:57.750 align:start position:0%
health to respect people's rights and to
get

02:53:57.750 --> 02:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
get
 
02:53:57.760 --> 02:53:59.269 align:start position:0%
get
people's

02:53:59.269 --> 02:53:59.279 align:start position:0%
people's
 
02:54:01.269 --> 02:54:01.279 align:start position:0%
enthusiastic cooperation
 
02:54:04.950 --> 02:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
the way we do that is by having data
 
02:54:06.550 --> 02:54:06.560 align:start position:0%
following that data
 
02:54:06.560 --> 02:54:07.269 align:start position:0%
following that data
and

02:54:07.269 --> 02:54:07.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:54:09.750 --> 02:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
not mandating things when we heard when
 
02:54:12.870 --> 02:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
we had the committee to study
 
02:54:14.630 --> 02:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
intervention medical interventions and
 
02:54:17.190 --> 02:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
immunizations we heard from many many
 
02:54:20.309 --> 02:54:20.319 align:start position:0%
people we also realized at that time
 
02:54:21.750 --> 02:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
that as soon as the mandate started
 
02:54:24.150 --> 02:54:24.160 align:start position:0%
coming down the vaccination rate started
 
02:54:25.429 --> 02:54:25.439 align:start position:0%
tailing off
 
02:54:27.030 --> 02:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
once people were being forced to be
 
02:54:28.790 --> 02:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
vaccinated they were wondering what they
 
02:54:29.990 --> 02:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
were missing
 
02:54:32.309 --> 02:54:32.319 align:start position:0%
if you have to force me to do this
 
02:54:34.150 --> 02:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
is this really in my best interest and
 
02:54:36.630 --> 02:54:36.640 align:start position:0%
that actually caused i believe caused a
 
02:54:38.469 --> 02:54:38.479 align:start position:0%
decline in the acceptance rate of the
 
02:54:40.630 --> 02:54:40.640 align:start position:0%
vaccinations um i'm thankful that we
 
02:54:42.389 --> 02:54:42.399 align:start position:0%
have this statute in place i think that
 
02:54:44.070 --> 02:54:44.080 align:start position:0%
it is critical because
 
02:54:45.830 --> 02:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
discrimination for a medical choice is
 
02:54:48.389 --> 02:54:48.399 align:start position:0%
wrong no matter what medical choice that
 
02:54:51.190 --> 02:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
is it is wrong and therefore i believe
 
02:54:53.269 --> 02:54:53.279 align:start position:0%
that we need to keep the statute as it
 
02:54:54.870 --> 02:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
stands and
 
02:54:56.870 --> 02:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
itl this bill
 
02:54:59.510 --> 02:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
02:55:01.750 --> 02:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
thank you um i will be
 
02:55:04.309 --> 02:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
voting ought to pass for this bill and
 
02:55:06.309 --> 02:55:06.319 align:start position:0%
um small picture
 
02:55:08.230 --> 02:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
um i think it's a problem that the
 
02:55:10.630 --> 02:55:10.640 align:start position:0%
statute as it currently exists
 
02:55:13.590 --> 02:55:13.600 align:start position:0%
does not include an exception for public
 
02:55:16.309 --> 02:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
universities and public colleges which
 
02:55:18.790 --> 02:55:18.800 align:start position:0%
have congregate living the same way that
 
02:55:21.830 --> 02:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
nursing homes and state-run hospitals
 
02:55:23.510 --> 02:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
like glencliff
 
02:55:23.520 --> 02:55:24.389 align:start position:0%
like glencliff
and

02:55:24.389 --> 02:55:24.399 align:start position:0%

02:55:26.630 --> 02:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital have they both
 
02:55:28.830 --> 02:55:28.840 align:start position:0%
have that in common
 
02:55:32.550 --> 02:55:32.560 align:start position:0%
um dorm living congregate living
 
02:55:35.590 --> 02:55:35.600 align:start position:0%

02:55:37.830 --> 02:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
from this act and the other was not so
 
02:55:41.030 --> 02:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
that's a small picture of um
 
02:55:42.710 --> 02:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
something in the statute that i disagree
 
02:55:48.389 --> 02:55:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:50.630 --> 02:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
you know i think there have just been
 
02:55:50.640 --> 02:55:52.070 align:start position:0%
you know i think there have just been
um

02:55:52.070 --> 02:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:52.080 --> 02:55:53.190 align:start position:0%
um
not

02:55:53.190 --> 02:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:55:57.110 --> 02:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
one bill not two bills and not
 
02:55:59.110 --> 02:55:59.120 align:start position:0%
scores of bills really
 
02:56:01.429 --> 02:56:01.439 align:start position:0%
which are promoting
 
02:56:03.110 --> 02:56:03.120 align:start position:0%
ideas about
 
02:56:03.120 --> 02:56:07.190 align:start position:0%
ideas about
privacy

02:56:07.190 --> 02:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:10.870 --> 02:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:14.389 --> 02:56:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:17.269 --> 02:56:17.279 align:start position:0%
i understand these bills but i think the
 
02:56:19.990 --> 02:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
bills that have been coming to us
 
02:56:22.950 --> 02:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
day after day after day are so heavily
 
02:56:27.670 --> 02:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:29.269 --> 02:56:29.279 align:start position:0%
personal issues
 
02:56:31.429 --> 02:56:31.439 align:start position:0%
at the
 
02:56:32.870 --> 02:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
end and
 
02:56:35.110 --> 02:56:35.120 align:start position:0%
where is the concern about
 
02:56:37.110 --> 02:56:37.120 align:start position:0%
the common good where is the concern
 
02:56:37.120 --> 02:56:37.990 align:start position:0%
the common good where is the concern
about

02:56:37.990 --> 02:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:56:41.030 --> 02:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
public health
 
02:56:43.030 --> 02:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
02:56:45.750 --> 02:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
we have just tipped the scales in terms
 
02:56:45.760 --> 02:56:46.710 align:start position:0%
we have just tipped the scales in terms
of

02:56:46.710 --> 02:56:46.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:56:49.830 --> 02:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
privacy personal liberty choice
 
02:56:49.840 --> 02:56:50.710 align:start position:0%
privacy personal liberty choice
and

02:56:50.710 --> 02:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:56:54.870 --> 02:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
we are not taking into consideration
 
02:56:56.790 --> 02:56:56.800 align:start position:0%
the greater good for the greater number
 
02:56:58.870 --> 02:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
of people i mean i think a
 
02:57:01.269 --> 02:57:01.279 align:start position:0%
lot of the things that we decide here
 
02:57:01.279 --> 02:57:03.670 align:start position:0%
lot of the things that we decide here
have

02:57:03.670 --> 02:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:03.680 --> 02:57:05.190 align:start position:0%
 
dueling

02:57:05.190 --> 02:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
dueling
 
02:57:05.200 --> 02:57:06.389 align:start position:0%
dueling
goods

02:57:06.389 --> 02:57:06.399 align:start position:0%
goods
 
02:57:09.349 --> 02:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
and i think that we are way over on the
 
02:57:09.359 --> 02:57:10.230 align:start position:0%
and i think that we are way over on the
side

02:57:10.230 --> 02:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
side
 
02:57:13.429 --> 02:57:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:16.389 --> 02:57:16.399 align:start position:0%
we we have we we talked earlier or
 
02:57:19.269 --> 02:57:19.279 align:start position:0%
somebody talked um representative leon
 
02:57:20.870 --> 02:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
talked about trust
 
02:57:22.870 --> 02:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
and i think these
 
02:57:25.830 --> 02:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
bills one after another after another in
 
02:57:27.990 --> 02:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
my mind are what's building this
 
02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:29.429 align:start position:0%
my mind are what's building this
distrust

02:57:29.429 --> 02:57:29.439 align:start position:0%
distrust
 
02:57:29.439 --> 02:57:30.309 align:start position:0%
distrust
so

02:57:30.309 --> 02:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:57:30.319 --> 02:57:31.269 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:57:31.269 --> 02:57:31.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:57:33.510 --> 02:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
i don't think we need the spill i mean i
 
02:57:35.590 --> 02:57:35.600 align:start position:0%
don't think we need the statute and so
 
02:57:39.590 --> 02:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:41.429 --> 02:57:41.439 align:start position:0%
representative acton
 
02:57:44.710 --> 02:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:45.990 --> 02:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of the
 
02:57:48.389 --> 02:57:48.399 align:start position:0%
a lot of these bills are pushed back in
 
02:57:51.990 --> 02:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
response to what we've been through
 
02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:53.429 align:start position:0%
response to what we've been through
so

02:57:53.429 --> 02:57:53.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:57:55.670 --> 02:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
they don't they didn't just materialize
 
02:57:57.269 --> 02:57:57.279 align:start position:0%
out of thin air
 
02:57:59.269 --> 02:57:59.279 align:start position:0%
a lot of it's based on what what we've
 
02:58:00.950 --> 02:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
endured through covet
 
02:58:03.510 --> 02:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
and it's been intense it's been a lot of
 
02:58:05.429 --> 02:58:05.439 align:start position:0%
loss of liberties
 
02:58:07.510 --> 02:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
one thing after another and we've hit a
 
02:58:09.590 --> 02:58:09.600 align:start position:0%
brick wall here as far as the
 
02:58:11.830 --> 02:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
the uh department and the
 
02:58:14.469 --> 02:58:14.479 align:start position:0%
the associations and the lobbyists
 
02:58:16.389 --> 02:58:16.399 align:start position:0%
groups and so forth in in
 
02:58:18.389 --> 02:58:18.399 align:start position:0%
opposing what the majority of lease is
 
02:58:19.830 --> 02:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
trying to do so
 
02:58:21.269 --> 02:58:21.279 align:start position:0%
yes we have a lot of bills and we all
 
02:58:22.469 --> 02:58:22.479 align:start position:0%
notice that
 
02:58:24.309 --> 02:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
um some of them tend to be a little bit
 
02:58:26.790 --> 02:58:26.800 align:start position:0%
knee-jerk in reaction we're working
 
02:58:28.710 --> 02:58:28.720 align:start position:0%
through that but these were not just
 
02:58:30.389 --> 02:58:30.399 align:start position:0%
brought out of thin air they they
 
02:58:32.790 --> 02:58:32.800 align:start position:0%
happened because they're
 
02:58:35.990 --> 02:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
they're our response to what we feel is
 
02:58:38.870 --> 02:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh overplaying of of your hand by by the
 
02:58:42.389 --> 02:58:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:44.070 --> 02:58:44.080 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
02:58:46.150 --> 02:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
representative merchant i'm going to
 
02:58:48.309 --> 02:58:48.319 align:start position:0%
take a different tack on this
 
02:58:51.429 --> 02:58:51.439 align:start position:0%
if we repeal this
 
02:58:51.439 --> 02:58:53.670 align:start position:0%
if we repeal this
statute

02:58:53.670 --> 02:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:58:55.910 --> 02:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
then we're also at the same time
 
02:58:58.710 --> 02:58:58.720 align:start position:0%
repealing the ability for a nursing home
 
02:59:01.750 --> 02:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
to require a vaccine
 
02:59:04.230 --> 02:59:04.240 align:start position:0%
so in essence it's not just the question
 
02:59:06.309 --> 02:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
of looking at repealing it
 
02:59:07.990 --> 02:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
from the patient's right
 
02:59:09.110 --> 02:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
per se
 
02:59:10.790 --> 02:59:10.800 align:start position:0%
but it's also appealing the fact that we
 
02:59:13.349 --> 02:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
carved out of here exceptions to this
 
02:59:15.349 --> 02:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
and if we repeal that all those
 
02:59:17.510 --> 02:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
exceptions go by the wayside
 
02:59:19.349 --> 02:59:19.359 align:start position:0%
and i'm concerned about those exceptions
 
02:59:20.870 --> 02:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
not being there
 
02:59:22.630 --> 02:59:22.640 align:start position:0%
for all the reasons why they were there
 
02:59:24.070 --> 02:59:24.080 align:start position:0%
in the first place
 
02:59:25.910 --> 02:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
so i'm taking a different tack on this
 
02:59:26.870 --> 02:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
and saying
 
02:59:28.550 --> 02:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
i'm against repealing it because i want
 
02:59:29.910 --> 02:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
to protect
 
02:59:31.750 --> 02:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
those that were excluded so that they
 
02:59:33.429 --> 02:59:33.439 align:start position:0%
are being able to be protected in some
 
02:59:37.269 --> 02:59:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:39.190 --> 02:59:39.200 align:start position:0%
representative canarch
 
02:59:41.590 --> 02:59:41.600 align:start position:0%
those exceptions were put in
 
02:59:44.150 --> 02:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
because of this act
 
02:59:46.389 --> 02:59:46.399 align:start position:0%
those exceptions if this act goes away
 
02:59:48.389 --> 02:59:48.399 align:start position:0%
those exceptions are still there the
 
02:59:50.790 --> 02:59:50.800 align:start position:0%
nursing homes prior to this act were
 
02:59:53.349 --> 02:59:53.359 align:start position:0%
allowed to mandate vaccinations which
 
02:59:56.070 --> 02:59:56.080 align:start position:0%
they do for any number of other diseases
 
02:59:58.230 --> 02:59:58.240 align:start position:0%
the only reason because when 220 came
 
03:00:00.309 --> 03:00:00.319 align:start position:0%
initially which is what this bill was
 
03:00:01.429 --> 03:00:01.439 align:start position:0%
last year
 
03:00:03.349 --> 03:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
it did not have these exceptions and we
 
03:00:05.590 --> 03:00:05.600 align:start position:0%
realized that this was going to cause
 
03:00:07.429 --> 03:00:07.439 align:start position:0%
any number of issues such as for example
 
03:00:09.110 --> 03:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
you couldn't involuntarily commit
 
03:00:10.469 --> 03:00:10.479 align:start position:0%
somebody for mental health treatment
 
03:00:11.990 --> 03:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
when they're suicidal
 
03:00:14.309 --> 03:00:14.319 align:start position:0%
so that was carved out as exception
 
03:00:16.469 --> 03:00:16.479 align:start position:0%
the exceptions are there because of this
 
03:00:16.479 --> 03:00:17.910 align:start position:0%
the exceptions are there because of this
bill

03:00:17.910 --> 03:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:00:20.070 --> 03:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
there's if this bill goes away the
 
03:00:21.750 --> 03:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
exceptions aren't needed because they
 
03:00:25.030 --> 03:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
were already in practice so that's not a
 
03:00:25.040 --> 03:00:27.030 align:start position:0%
were already in practice so that's not a
problem

03:00:27.030 --> 03:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
problem
 
03:00:40.630 --> 03:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:45.429 --> 03:00:45.439 align:start position:0%
yeah just and plus also we saw in 1604
 
03:00:47.429 --> 03:00:47.439 align:start position:0%
uh you know rolling that back anyway
 
03:00:49.510 --> 03:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
losing that exception so
 
03:00:51.830 --> 03:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's these it's perfectly
 
03:00:53.190 --> 03:00:53.200 align:start position:0%
reasonable just get rid of it we aren't
 
03:00:58.150 --> 03:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:00.309 --> 03:01:00.319 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions

packard
 
03:03:15.830 --> 03:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
and it is relative to state enforcement
 
03:03:17.190 --> 03:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
of federal
 
03:03:20.710 --> 03:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
vaccination mandates and while i think
 
03:03:22.070 --> 03:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
about it
 
03:03:25.190 --> 03:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
there were 513 people signing in in
 
03:03:27.990 --> 03:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
favor of it and 98
 
03:03:30.469 --> 03:03:30.479 align:start position:0%
against we had
 
03:03:32.630 --> 03:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
thought there might be some amendments
 
03:03:34.710 --> 03:03:34.720 align:start position:0%
but eventually the
 
03:03:37.830 --> 03:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
conclusion which the speaker agreed with
 
03:03:40.469 --> 03:03:40.479 align:start position:0%
is just a straight up bill
 
03:03:43.429 --> 03:03:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:45.750 --> 03:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:03:48.309 --> 03:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
as the chairman of the speaker's bill i
 
03:03:51.269 --> 03:03:51.279 align:start position:0%
recognize myself for a motion and i move
 
03:03:54.710 --> 03:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
out to pass and that is being seconded
 
03:03:54.720 --> 03:03:56.710 align:start position:0%
out to pass and that is being seconded
by

03:03:56.710 --> 03:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
by
 
03:04:06.230 --> 03:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:09.269 --> 03:04:09.279 align:start position:0%
representative canuck
 
03:04:09.279 --> 03:04:10.710 align:start position:0%
representative canuck
well

03:04:10.710 --> 03:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:04:13.510 --> 03:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:15.750 --> 03:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
oh i know i would but i'm doing three
 
03:04:15.760 --> 03:04:28.469 align:start position:0%
oh i know i would but i'm doing three
things

03:04:28.469 --> 03:04:28.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:28.479 --> 03:04:30.230 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:04:30.230 --> 03:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:04:32.150 --> 03:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
who would like to speak for
 
03:04:35.590 --> 03:04:35.600 align:start position:0%
representative cushman you seconded it
 
03:04:38.790 --> 03:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
so we have here representative packard's
 
03:04:42.070 --> 03:04:42.080 align:start position:0%
bill we decided no amendments are needed
 
03:04:44.389 --> 03:04:44.399 align:start position:0%
and we want to say to the federal
 
03:04:46.150 --> 03:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
government that new hampshire is going
 
03:04:47.750 --> 03:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
to do things the way new hampshire is
 
03:04:49.269 --> 03:04:49.279 align:start position:0%
going to do things and we are not going
 
03:04:50.630 --> 03:04:50.640 align:start position:0%
to be blackmailed by the federal
 
03:04:53.190 --> 03:04:53.200 align:start position:0%
government and we will not enforce the
 
03:04:55.670 --> 03:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
federal government's
 
03:04:55.680 --> 03:04:56.790 align:start position:0%
federal government's
dictates

03:04:56.790 --> 03:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
dictates
 
03:04:56.800 --> 03:04:57.590 align:start position:0%
dictates
that

03:04:57.590 --> 03:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:05:00.630 --> 03:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
we need to mandate vaccinations or
 
03:05:02.550 --> 03:05:02.560 align:start position:0%
comply with that so we're not going to
 
03:05:04.710 --> 03:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
send any information to them
 
03:05:04.720 --> 03:05:06.550 align:start position:0%
send any information to them
and

03:05:06.550 --> 03:05:06.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:05:09.830 --> 03:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
other states have sanctuary
 
03:05:12.469 --> 03:05:12.479 align:start position:0%
policies for
 
03:05:14.870 --> 03:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
immigrants and when it comes to
 
03:05:17.349 --> 03:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement of immigration laws and if
 
03:05:19.349 --> 03:05:19.359 align:start position:0%
those can apply there then this one can
 
03:05:20.950 --> 03:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
apply here
 
03:05:22.870 --> 03:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
that's what i was going to say
 
03:05:24.950 --> 03:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
representative knurk yes thank you very
 
03:05:26.550 --> 03:05:26.560 align:start position:0%
much um
 
03:05:27.910 --> 03:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
once again we're back to the same
 
03:05:30.830 --> 03:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
arguments that were made in 1604 we do
 
03:05:33.670 --> 03:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
have uh this will interfere with the
 
03:05:37.030 --> 03:05:37.040 align:start position:0%
ability of our hospitals for example and
 
03:05:38.389 --> 03:05:38.399 align:start position:0%
including our nursing homes at the
 
03:05:39.910 --> 03:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
county level which are political
 
03:05:39.920 --> 03:05:41.269 align:start position:0%
county level which are political
subdivisions

03:05:41.269 --> 03:05:41.279 align:start position:0%
subdivisions
 
03:05:43.429 --> 03:05:43.439 align:start position:0%
uh to be able to set their own policies
 
03:05:45.750 --> 03:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
or to to actually in this particular
 
03:05:47.830 --> 03:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
case to
 
03:05:50.950 --> 03:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
follow the policies of the cms mandates
 
03:05:53.190 --> 03:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
which will put their funding at risk and
 
03:05:54.630 --> 03:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
i know that the argument keeps being
 
03:05:56.309 --> 03:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
made that the
 
03:05:58.230 --> 03:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
it hasn't happened yet in other states
 
03:06:00.070 --> 03:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
but to remember that it is a new
 
03:06:02.710 --> 03:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
requirement and the first steps are to
 
03:06:04.630 --> 03:06:04.640 align:start position:0%
first determine that the person at the
 
03:06:07.110 --> 03:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
hospital i'm sorry is out of compliance
 
03:06:09.349 --> 03:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
after that are warning letters the
 
03:06:12.070 --> 03:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
ability to remediate that lack of
 
03:06:14.309 --> 03:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
compliance and on and on down the line
 
03:06:17.349 --> 03:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
before payment is withheld and again the
 
03:06:19.110 --> 03:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
supreme court though it was a stay of an
 
03:06:20.870 --> 03:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
injunction there have been no appeals
 
03:06:23.590 --> 03:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
filed yet against that injunction
 
03:06:26.550 --> 03:06:26.560 align:start position:0%
and their language is perfectly clear
 
03:06:29.910 --> 03:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
and in the cms rules it states clearly
 
03:06:33.110 --> 03:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
that if states pass other rules that
 
03:06:34.950 --> 03:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
they are uh
 
03:06:38.070 --> 03:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
that the cms mandate rides over that due
 
03:06:39.990 --> 03:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
to the supremacy clause
 
03:06:42.710 --> 03:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
that's in the rules and that they've
 
03:06:44.870 --> 03:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
also given that
 
03:06:46.870 --> 03:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
that uh that's what i want to say
 
03:06:46.880 --> 03:06:48.070 align:start position:0%
that uh that's what i want to say
guidance

03:06:48.070 --> 03:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
guidance
 
03:06:49.750 --> 03:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
so with all that in mind this gives us
 
03:06:52.790 --> 03:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
the same problem we had with 1604
 
03:06:54.790 --> 03:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
it puts us at risk and particularly for
 
03:06:57.510 --> 03:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
the nursing homes and for the hospitals
 
03:06:59.910 --> 03:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
of funding and that's not a matter of
 
03:06:59.920 --> 03:07:01.030 align:start position:0%
of funding and that's not a matter of
blackmail

03:07:01.030 --> 03:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
blackmail
 
03:07:03.750 --> 03:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
it is a matter of following proper
 
03:07:03.760 --> 03:07:04.790 align:start position:0%
it is a matter of following proper
medical

03:07:04.790 --> 03:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
medical
 
03:07:07.269 --> 03:07:07.279 align:start position:0%
care proper medical care is to not undo
 
03:07:07.279 --> 03:07:08.710 align:start position:0%
care proper medical care is to not undo
the

03:07:08.710 --> 03:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:07:10.870 --> 03:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
cause a patient have an undue
 
03:07:13.429 --> 03:07:13.439 align:start position:0%
exposure to a communicable disease that
 
03:07:15.349 --> 03:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
they don't need to face they have enough
 
03:07:16.630 --> 03:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
risks when they come in the hospital
 
03:07:17.990 --> 03:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
from the things that
 
03:07:20.150 --> 03:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
people like gary woods and i do to them
 
03:07:21.830 --> 03:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
they don't have to face things that they
 
03:07:23.190 --> 03:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
don't have to face
 
03:07:24.950 --> 03:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
and there are a lot of various
 
03:07:26.630 --> 03:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
guidelines that are set
 
03:07:28.230 --> 03:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
uh by
 
03:07:30.870 --> 03:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
cms and by accrediting agencies for what
 
03:07:33.030 --> 03:07:33.040 align:start position:0%
needs to be done to make sure that
 
03:07:34.710 --> 03:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
proper standards are followed whether
 
03:07:34.720 --> 03:07:35.510 align:start position:0%
proper standards are followed whether
it's

03:07:35.510 --> 03:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:07:38.469 --> 03:07:38.479 align:start position:0%
central line insertion whether it's
 
03:07:41.110 --> 03:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
infection rates uh vaccinations any
 
03:07:42.550 --> 03:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
number of things
 
03:07:44.950 --> 03:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
and it is a matter of complying with
 
03:07:47.190 --> 03:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
that not for blackmail but for the best
 
03:07:48.710 --> 03:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
medical care
 
03:07:50.230 --> 03:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
so i would vote

that it would be best to not have a form
 
04:03:55.590 --> 04:03:55.600 align:start position:0%

and that patients shall be able to
 
04:04:22.550 --> 04:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
receive a
 
04:04:25.030 --> 04:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
print out of their vaccination records
 
04:04:27.189 --> 04:04:27.199 align:start position:0%
if they request it from the provider
 
04:04:29.110 --> 04:04:29.120 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:04:30.229 --> 04:04:30.239 align:start position:0%
section b
 
04:04:33.269 --> 04:04:33.279 align:start position:0%
just clarifies
 
04:04:35.429 --> 04:04:35.439 align:start position:0%
and strengthens that
 
04:04:38.469 --> 04:04:38.479 align:start position:0%
um opt-in or opt-out option to
 
04:04:41.030 --> 04:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
require positive consent for the
 
04:04:44.469 --> 04:04:44.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:46.790 --> 04:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
any questions or comments
 
04:04:49.349 --> 04:04:49.359 align:start position:0%
nope i think one of the things which was
 
04:04:52.469 --> 04:04:52.479 align:start position:0%
important this came actually from
 
04:04:54.550 --> 04:04:54.560 align:start position:0%
an interesting gentleman in my life i
 
04:04:55.990 --> 04:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
mean a lady in my life uh who's also
 
04:04:57.110 --> 04:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
school nurse and he said what's in it
 
04:04:58.710 --> 04:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
for the patient
 
04:05:00.870 --> 04:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
and she said at that point in time
 
04:05:02.550 --> 04:05:02.560 align:start position:0%
it'd be nice if you actually could allow
 
04:05:04.309 --> 04:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
the patient or the parent to go down to
 
04:05:06.389 --> 04:05:06.399 align:start position:0%
a provider and get a print out of the
 
04:05:08.229 --> 04:05:08.239 align:start position:0%
vaccine registry
 
04:05:10.070 --> 04:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
the history if you will so if they want
 
04:05:12.070 --> 04:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
to go to a summer camp if they want to
 
04:05:14.150 --> 04:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
go to a transport another school and so
 
04:05:15.990 --> 04:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
forth they don't have to maintain the
 
04:05:17.510 --> 04:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
vaccine registry themselves they can
 
04:05:19.189 --> 04:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
actually go down to a provider and ask
 
04:05:21.590 --> 04:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
for that print out so she's basically
 
04:05:23.590 --> 04:05:23.600 align:start position:0%
said focus sometimes of what's in a
 
04:05:24.790 --> 04:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
patient always what's in it for the
 
04:05:24.800 --> 04:05:26.229 align:start position:0%
patient always what's in it for the
provider

04:05:26.229 --> 04:05:26.239 align:start position:0%
provider
 
04:05:28.229 --> 04:05:28.239 align:start position:0%
strong patient advocate representative
 
04:05:28.239 --> 04:05:29.510 align:start position:0%
strong patient advocate representative
knurk

04:05:29.510 --> 04:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
knurk
 
04:05:31.189 --> 04:05:31.199 align:start position:0%
i think this is really minor and we
 
04:05:32.630 --> 04:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
don't want to change it but it's a
 
04:05:34.389 --> 04:05:34.399 align:start position:0%
interesting wording
 
04:05:37.510 --> 04:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
on lines nine and eight nine and ten
 
04:05:39.670 --> 04:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
that they may receive a print out of all
 
04:05:41.590 --> 04:05:41.600 align:start position:0%
vaccines in the registry i think what
 
04:05:43.750 --> 04:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
you really mean is all of their
 
04:05:46.630 --> 04:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
vaccinations in the registry otherwise
 
04:05:48.070 --> 04:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
this would be that they could get a
 
04:05:49.750 --> 04:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
printout of the list of vaccines that
 
04:05:51.830 --> 04:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
are in the registry or everybody's
 
04:05:53.830 --> 04:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
records which we don't want
 
04:05:55.189 --> 04:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
and i don't think that's what you mean i
 
04:05:56.469 --> 04:05:56.479 align:start position:0%
know that's not what you mean i'm just
 
04:05:57.830 --> 04:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out whether we really
 
04:05:59.269 --> 04:05:59.279 align:start position:0%
have to worry about the wording or is
 
04:06:01.030 --> 04:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
this clear enough and implicit in what
 
04:06:02.229 --> 04:06:02.239 align:start position:0%
we're doing
 
04:06:04.710 --> 04:06:04.720 align:start position:0%
the lawyer says it's okay fine
 
04:06:07.830 --> 04:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
and the senate maybe will fix it
 
04:06:09.830 --> 04:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
04:06:11.429 --> 04:06:11.439 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
04:06:13.349 --> 04:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
mr chairman um
 
04:06:15.510 --> 04:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
in my in my thinking
 
04:06:15.520 --> 04:06:16.790 align:start position:0%
in my in my thinking
this

04:06:16.790 --> 04:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:06:16.800 --> 04:06:17.990 align:start position:0%
this
amendment

04:06:17.990 --> 04:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:06:19.510 --> 04:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:06:19.520 --> 04:06:20.630 align:start position:0%
this bill
really

04:06:20.630 --> 04:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:06:22.710 --> 04:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
changes the vaccine
 
04:06:28.950 --> 04:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:30.710 --> 04:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
program and
 
04:06:34.229 --> 04:06:34.239 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony
 
04:06:36.790 --> 04:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
from various people including department
 
04:06:38.790 --> 04:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
of health and human services i believe i
 
04:06:40.950 --> 04:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
don't want to speak for them that this
 
04:06:40.960 --> 04:06:42.070 align:start position:0%
don't want to speak for them that this
would

04:06:42.070 --> 04:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:06:45.429 --> 04:06:45.439 align:start position:0%
be onerous for
 
04:06:47.510 --> 04:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
for providers offices
 
04:06:49.750 --> 04:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
and also that it would decrease the
 
04:06:51.269 --> 04:06:51.279 align:start position:0%
number of people who actually
 
04:06:54.229 --> 04:06:54.239 align:start position:0%
participated in the vaccine registry
 
04:06:56.309 --> 04:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
which would make it a less robust and
 
04:06:57.670 --> 04:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
less useful
 
04:06:57.680 --> 04:07:00.229 align:start position:0%
less useful
program

04:07:00.229 --> 04:07:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:02.550 --> 04:07:02.560 align:start position:0%
of course nobody can predict how much it
 
04:07:04.870 --> 04:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
will decrease the participation and you
 
04:07:07.750 --> 04:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
know it may be 3 percent or it may be 20
 
04:07:09.670 --> 04:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
nobody can predict that we will see i
 
04:07:12.630 --> 04:07:12.640 align:start position:0%
guess um but i'm going to vote against
 
04:07:15.349 --> 04:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
this because of those two issues
 
04:07:17.030 --> 04:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
04:07:19.110 --> 04:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
04:07:21.590 --> 04:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
we considered all of those and came to
 
04:07:24.309 --> 04:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
the conclusion that with the opt-in
 
04:07:24.319 --> 04:07:26.229 align:start position:0%
the conclusion that with the opt-in
opt-out

04:07:26.229 --> 04:07:26.239 align:start position:0%
opt-out
 
04:07:28.070 --> 04:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
that would perhaps
 
04:07:28.080 --> 04:07:29.590 align:start position:0%
that would perhaps
perhaps

04:07:29.590 --> 04:07:29.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
04:07:32.630 --> 04:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh if we kept it strictly as an opt-in
 
04:07:34.710 --> 04:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
there perhaps would be as much as three
 
04:07:37.030 --> 04:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
percent loss is
 
04:07:38.790 --> 04:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
as an estimate and other people may have
 
04:07:41.349 --> 04:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
a more rigorous number
 
04:07:41.359 --> 04:07:42.389 align:start position:0%
a more rigorous number
um

04:07:42.389 --> 04:07:42.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:45.110 --> 04:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
that balanced against uh the issue that
 
04:07:46.790 --> 04:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
if it was
 
04:07:49.189 --> 04:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
a opt-in opt-out
 
04:07:52.550 --> 04:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
people could still get the vaccine
 
04:07:52.560 --> 04:07:53.429 align:start position:0%
people could still get the vaccine
okay

04:07:53.429 --> 04:07:53.439 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:07:55.670 --> 04:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
but not be in the regime not have their
 
04:07:57.510 --> 04:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
data into the registry that would
 
04:07:57.520 --> 04:07:58.630 align:start position:0%
data into the registry that would
increase

04:07:58.630 --> 04:07:58.640 align:start position:0%
increase
 
04:08:00.389 --> 04:08:00.399 align:start position:0%
the number
 
04:08:02.550 --> 04:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
as the bill reads
 
04:08:02.560 --> 04:08:03.510 align:start position:0%
as the bill reads
the

04:08:03.510 --> 04:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:08:05.030 --> 04:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
even though you
 
04:08:07.750 --> 04:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
opt out in terms of having your name and
 
04:08:10.229 --> 04:08:10.239 align:start position:0%
serial number in the registry
 
04:08:12.149 --> 04:08:12.159 align:start position:0%
the provider whoever provides the
 
04:08:14.590 --> 04:08:14.600 align:start position:0%
vaccination can still provide an
 
04:08:17.030 --> 04:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
unidentifiable number in other words
 
04:08:20.070 --> 04:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
providing 10 vaccines on a given day and
 
04:08:22.950 --> 04:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
here's seven or eight of the names and
 
04:08:25.590 --> 04:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
serial numbers and i have three that are
 
04:08:25.600 --> 04:08:26.389 align:start position:0%
serial numbers and i have three that are
just

04:08:26.389 --> 04:08:26.399 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:08:29.349 --> 04:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
vaccinations so that preserves
 
04:08:32.229 --> 04:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
the public health aspect as much as
 
04:08:32.239 --> 04:08:34.149 align:start position:0%
the public health aspect as much as
possible

04:08:34.149 --> 04:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
possible
 
04:08:34.159 --> 04:08:35.590 align:start position:0%
possible
so

04:08:35.590 --> 04:08:35.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:08:39.030 --> 04:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
it seems that this was a nice balance
 
04:08:41.429 --> 04:08:41.439 align:start position:0%
between the people who wanted to
 
04:08:41.439 --> 04:08:42.309 align:start position:0%
between the people who wanted to
not

04:08:42.309 --> 04:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:08:44.229 --> 04:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
have their name in the registry but
 
04:08:47.030 --> 04:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
still participate and get a vaccine
 
04:08:49.189 --> 04:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
and that's really what we're after
 
04:08:52.389 --> 04:08:52.399 align:start position:0%
the risk was that if in fact it was a
 
04:08:55.910 --> 04:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
total mandatory opt in there would be a
 
04:08:57.830 --> 04:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
finite number
 
04:09:01.110 --> 04:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
unknown that would say um i think i'll
 
04:09:03.750 --> 04:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
just skip the vaccine entirely
 
04:09:05.030 --> 04:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
because i don't want my name in the
 
04:09:07.670 --> 04:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
registry and therefore you miss that
 
04:09:07.680 --> 04:09:08.630 align:start position:0%
registry and therefore you miss that
number

04:09:08.630 --> 04:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
number
 
04:09:08.640 --> 04:09:09.750 align:start position:0%
number
so

04:09:09.750 --> 04:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:09:11.670 --> 04:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
balancing all those factors it seemed
 
04:09:14.229 --> 04:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
like the smartest thing to do
 
04:09:15.189 --> 04:09:15.199 align:start position:0%
that would
 
04:09:17.429 --> 04:09:17.439 align:start position:0%
give the greatest
 
04:09:18.790 --> 04:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
balance between
 
04:09:20.710 --> 04:09:20.720 align:start position:0%
what everybody wanted in their privacy
 
04:09:22.790 --> 04:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
but at the same time preserving the
 
04:09:24.309 --> 04:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
ability to make good public health
 
04:09:24.319 --> 04:09:25.830 align:start position:0%
ability to make good public health
decisions

04:09:25.830 --> 04:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
04:09:28.149 --> 04:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
representative kelsey thank you mr
 
04:09:30.469 --> 04:09:30.479 align:start position:0%
chairman i would also like to add i feel
 
04:09:33.830 --> 04:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
like we incentivized the registry by
 
04:09:36.630 --> 04:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
adding the portion where patients can
 
04:09:39.590 --> 04:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
now obtain their records having a child
 
04:09:41.269 --> 04:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
in school having a child that has gone
 
04:09:42.550 --> 04:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
to summer camp
 
04:09:44.710 --> 04:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
that is extremely
 
04:09:46.870 --> 04:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
convenient for the patients so i would
 
04:09:48.790 --> 04:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
like to add that i think that that
 
04:09:56.630 --> 04:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:58.870 --> 04:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
04:10:00.950 --> 04:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you i just have a question i'm i'm
 
04:10:03.429 --> 04:10:03.439 align:start position:0%
thrilled with this amendment um
 
04:10:06.630 --> 04:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
do do we have to specify that we report
 
04:10:09.510 --> 04:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
the count that's great to have it do we
 
04:10:12.710 --> 04:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
have to say that in the bill
 
04:10:14.469 --> 04:10:14.479 align:start position:0%
you know it's not in the bill what
 
04:10:17.510 --> 04:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
happens is when a provider uses state
 
04:10:20.389 --> 04:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
vaccine or vaccine for the safe program
 
04:10:21.910 --> 04:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
in order for them to replace that
 
04:10:23.510 --> 04:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
vaccine through safe program they have
 
04:10:25.189 --> 04:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
to notify the state how many vaccines
 
04:10:27.590 --> 04:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
they gave not who they gave it to
 
04:10:29.830 --> 04:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
but i gave 10
 
04:10:32.790 --> 04:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
and therefore those 10 go to the state
 
04:10:34.950 --> 04:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
program in order for them to replace the
 
04:10:34.960 --> 04:10:36.070 align:start position:0%
program in order for them to replace the
10.

04:10:36.070 --> 04:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
10.
 
04:10:37.830 --> 04:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
they maybe there's only nine in there
 
04:10:39.349 --> 04:10:39.359 align:start position:0%
that have a name in the registry but
 
04:10:40.630 --> 04:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
they have to tell the state how many
 
04:10:42.149 --> 04:10:42.159 align:start position:0%
they gave so they can get replacement of
 
04:10:42.159 --> 04:10:47.110 align:start position:0%
they gave so they can get replacement of
it

04:10:47.110 --> 04:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:49.110 --> 04:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
seeing no further discussion the motion
 
04:10:52.630 --> 04:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
before us is
 
04:10:57.189 --> 04:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:57.199 --> 04:10:58.229 align:start position:0%
 
does

04:10:58.229 --> 04:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
does
 
04:10:59.910 --> 04:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
given it says for each administered
 
04:11:01.349 --> 04:11:01.359 align:start position:0%
vaccine that would mean that the
 
04:11:04.229 --> 04:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
provider would need to do this
 
04:11:05.670 --> 04:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
if they're getting three vaccines in one
 
04:11:07.670 --> 04:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
visit because it doesn't it says for the
 
04:11:09.990 --> 04:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
vaccine not for any event of being in
 
04:11:11.750 --> 04:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
the office to get a vaccination or even
 
04:11:13.110 --> 04:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
if it's a series
 
04:11:14.950 --> 04:11:14.960 align:start position:0%
and likewise is it that every time that
 
04:11:16.149 --> 04:11:16.159 align:start position:0%
they're gonna have a vaccine they have
 
04:11:17.750 --> 04:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
to go through this even though they've
 
04:11:19.830 --> 04:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
already done it before just thinking of
 
04:11:21.990 --> 04:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
the work burden for the office can you
 
04:11:24.309 --> 04:11:24.319 align:start position:0%
clarify how that works
 
04:11:27.830 --> 04:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
i can um the forum when it's created
 
04:11:30.870 --> 04:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
it can list multiple vaccines at one
 
04:11:32.389 --> 04:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
time so you're not filling up multiple
 
04:11:32.399 --> 04:11:33.429 align:start position:0%
time so you're not filling up multiple
forms

04:11:33.429 --> 04:11:33.439 align:start position:0%
forms
 
04:11:35.429 --> 04:11:35.439 align:start position:0%
number two in the workload in the queue
 
04:11:37.910 --> 04:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
and i did talk to some providers about
 
04:11:37.920 --> 04:11:39.110 align:start position:0%
and i did talk to some providers about
this

04:11:39.110 --> 04:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:11:41.429 --> 04:11:41.439 align:start position:0%
in the electronic medical record the way
 
04:11:42.710 --> 04:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
they go through the process is a
 
04:11:44.790 --> 04:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
checklist that they go through so you
 
04:11:46.710 --> 04:11:46.720 align:start position:0%
can at that point in time in the
 
04:11:49.910 --> 04:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
software create a check box
 
04:11:51.990 --> 04:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
yes or no as far as the
 
04:11:53.349 --> 04:11:53.359 align:start position:0%
information go into the registry so
 
04:11:54.790 --> 04:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
therefore from the provider's point of
 
04:11:57.189 --> 04:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
view it should not be an
 
04:11:58.469 --> 04:11:58.479 align:start position:0%
additional burden to them because it's
 
04:12:04.149 --> 04:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:06.229 --> 04:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands
 
04:12:09.189 --> 04:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
and hearing of no hands
 
04:12:09.199 --> 04:12:11.189 align:start position:0%
and hearing of no hands
now

04:12:11.189 --> 04:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:12:13.590 --> 04:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
we are going to vote
 
04:12:16.469 --> 04:12:16.479 align:start position:0%

04:12:20.309 --> 04:12:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:23.110 --> 04:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
and the chair recognizes
 
04:12:23.120 --> 04:12:25.830 align:start position:0%

what are we up to now seven bills we've
 
04:16:58.710 --> 04:16:58.720 align:start position:0%
done wow

04:17:37.670 --> 04:17:37.680 align:start position:0%
have before you
 
04:17:39.269 --> 04:17:39.279 align:start position:0%

04:18:36.710 --> 04:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
and just for the record pupillary
 
04:18:38.550 --> 04:18:38.560 align:start position:0%
distance has nothing to do with how
 
04:18:45.110 --> 04:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:52.149 --> 04:18:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:54.790 --> 04:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
my granddaughter is really good at that
 
04:18:54.800 --> 04:19:24.790 align:start position:0%
my granddaughter is really good at that
hmm

04:19:24.790 --> 04:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:26.149 --> 04:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
what is this
 
04:19:27.110 --> 04:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
this is
 
04:19:30.950 --> 04:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
two oh we do have another one all right
 
04:19:39.590 --> 04:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:42.229 --> 04:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
here comes the others are coming
 
04:19:44.469 --> 04:19:44.479 align:start position:0%
some of these are not being presented
 
04:19:45.990 --> 04:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
let the chair announce what we're going
 
04:19:47.670 --> 04:19:47.680 align:start position:0%
to be looking at
 
04:19:49.750 --> 04:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
and that is zero eight six seven which
 
04:19:51.510 --> 04:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
you are in the process of getting from
 
04:19:53.830 --> 04:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
representative leon and representative
 
04:19:55.670 --> 04:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
zero nine six three that you have
 
04:19:57.349 --> 04:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
already gotten from representative
 
04:19:57.359 --> 04:20:04.790 align:start position:0%
already gotten from representative
merchants

04:20:04.790 --> 04:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:17.189 --> 04:20:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:34.550 --> 04:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:34.560 --> 04:20:53.750 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:20:53.750 --> 04:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:53.760 --> 04:21:53.429 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:21:53.429 --> 04:21:53.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:53.439 --> 04:22:16.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:22:16.830 --> 04:22:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:42.710 --> 04:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:44.550 --> 04:22:44.560 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't sound like it's gonna fly
 
04:23:05.910 --> 04:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:07.910 --> 04:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
all right the chair recognizes
 
04:23:12.149 --> 04:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
representatively on about um
 
04:23:14.950 --> 04:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
an issue in the drafting incorrect
 
04:23:17.349 --> 04:23:17.359 align:start position:0%
drafting of the amendment
 
04:23:19.750 --> 04:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
and that will help her get a sense of
 
04:23:22.710 --> 04:23:22.720 align:start position:0%
where she would like to go forward
 
04:23:24.630 --> 04:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:23:26.710 --> 04:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
after hearing all that we heard i had
 
04:23:27.910 --> 04:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
read through the wrong amendment the
 
04:23:30.070 --> 04:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
blue amendments that they had proposed
 
04:23:32.309 --> 04:23:32.319 align:start position:0%
and i liked everything except for
 
04:23:35.189 --> 04:23:35.199 align:start position:0%
making and a thalamus bring in a second
 
04:23:36.469 --> 04:23:36.479 align:start position:0%
professional in order to get the
 
04:23:38.870 --> 04:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
intrapupillary distance my intention in
 
04:23:40.550 --> 04:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
drafting this was to take both of their
 
04:23:42.389 --> 04:23:42.399 align:start position:0%
amendments and simply strip out that
 
04:23:45.269 --> 04:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
interpupillary distance
 
04:23:48.070 --> 04:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
if there is sufficient interest to move
 
04:23:50.149 --> 04:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
this forward without the interpupillary
 
04:23:51.830 --> 04:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
distance but clarifying the
 
04:23:54.309 --> 04:23:54.319 align:start position:0%
prescriptions i can get this redrafted
 
04:23:54.319 --> 04:23:55.429 align:start position:0%
prescriptions i can get this redrafted
correctly

04:23:55.429 --> 04:23:55.439 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
04:23:57.590 --> 04:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
but if we're looking if we're looking
 
04:23:59.590 --> 04:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
more towards this merchant amendment and
 
04:24:01.510 --> 04:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
making sure that we are in fact going to
 
04:24:03.830 --> 04:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
require intrapupillary distance then i
 
04:24:05.510 --> 04:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
don't need to redraft this right now
 
04:24:06.870 --> 04:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
this deletes
 
04:24:08.950 --> 04:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
section two and three
 
04:24:11.990 --> 04:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
of the original bill because it was
 
04:24:14.790 --> 04:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
drafted as a replace all and i apologize
 
04:24:17.670 --> 04:24:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:20.070 --> 04:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
so let's discuss what representative
 
04:24:22.550 --> 04:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
leon has posed to us whether she needs
 
04:24:25.750 --> 04:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
to go forward or we don't think so um
 
04:24:28.870 --> 04:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative canark
 
04:24:30.550 --> 04:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
so i'm a little bit confused what you're
 
04:24:31.830 --> 04:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
saying is
 
04:24:33.670 --> 04:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
the amendment as you drafted it is not
 
04:24:35.830 --> 04:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
what you intended because you did intend
 
04:24:37.830 --> 04:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
to still keep in
 
04:24:37.840 --> 04:24:38.790 align:start position:0%
to still keep in
section

04:24:38.790 --> 04:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
section
 
04:24:40.950 --> 04:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
three of the original bill
 
04:24:43.910 --> 04:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
or not i'm really confused as to
 
04:24:45.269 --> 04:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
what you intended and what you're
 
04:24:47.510 --> 04:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
thinking you might want to do can you
 
04:24:49.590 --> 04:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
clarify that for me please
 
04:24:51.349 --> 04:24:51.359 align:start position:0%
yes and i apologize i actually have a
 
04:24:53.590 --> 04:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
terrible migraine today so it's always
 
04:24:55.510 --> 04:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
great to swim through mud um well we
 
04:24:58.950 --> 04:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
passed that we it'll that bill
 
04:25:00.790 --> 04:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
having migraines
 
04:25:02.389 --> 04:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
if you can outlaw migraines that make me
 
04:25:04.710 --> 04:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
happy actually you are correct because
 
04:25:06.149 --> 04:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
there would be no changes in two and
 
04:25:08.229 --> 04:25:08.239 align:start position:0%
three right so because we strike
 
04:25:09.830 --> 04:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
interpupillary distance it doesn't need
 
04:25:11.590 --> 04:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
to be amended
 
04:25:13.429 --> 04:25:13.439 align:start position:0%
okay i'm new to this i'd rather call out
 
04:25:15.349 --> 04:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
my possible mistakes than miss them so
 
04:25:16.790 --> 04:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
just to clarify so so in other words
 
04:25:19.030 --> 04:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
your intention was to not
 
04:25:21.429 --> 04:25:21.439 align:start position:0%
your intention is to not mandate
 
04:25:23.269 --> 04:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
interpullary distance measurement is
 
04:25:25.910 --> 04:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
that correct yes that is my intention
 
04:25:27.189 --> 04:25:27.199 align:start position:0%
i'm with you
 
04:25:35.429 --> 04:25:35.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:37.269 --> 04:25:37.279 align:start position:0%
so your pleasure is to do what uh my
 
04:25:39.269 --> 04:25:39.279 align:start position:0%
pleasure is we go ahead and discuss it
 
04:25:41.030 --> 04:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
since i don't have a drafting error in
 
04:25:41.040 --> 04:25:42.630 align:start position:0%
since i don't have a drafting error in
fact

04:25:42.630 --> 04:25:42.640 align:start position:0%
fact
 
04:25:44.870 --> 04:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
okay we can discuss representative leon
 
04:25:47.910 --> 04:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
let us know what your amendment is about
 
04:25:50.950 --> 04:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman my amendment is to
 
04:25:53.269 --> 04:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
keep the areas that were brought up
 
04:25:55.510 --> 04:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
about making sure that private label and
 
04:25:58.070 --> 04:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
brand name lenses can be substituted for
 
04:25:59.590 --> 04:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
each other if as long as they're the
 
04:26:01.830 --> 04:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
same manufacturer that substitutions are
 
04:26:03.590 --> 04:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
just for health reasons
 
04:26:06.790 --> 04:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
and basically to give a little bit more
 
04:26:09.269 --> 04:26:09.279 align:start position:0%
more power for consumers to shop around
 
04:26:11.670 --> 04:26:11.680 align:start position:0%
without requiring one professional to
 
04:26:13.750 --> 04:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
bring a second professional in to write
 
04:26:15.189 --> 04:26:15.199 align:start position:0%
a prescription
 
04:26:17.110 --> 04:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
that's really that really was my
 
04:26:18.710 --> 04:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
challenge because
 
04:26:20.070 --> 04:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
if it was something that was done in the
 
04:26:22.149 --> 04:26:22.159 align:start position:0%
regular course of business for the
 
04:26:24.710 --> 04:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
optometrist um
 
04:26:24.720 --> 04:26:26.469 align:start position:0%
optometrist um
ophthalmologist

04:26:26.469 --> 04:26:26.479 align:start position:0%
ophthalmologist
 
04:26:27.910 --> 04:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
if the professional writing the
 
04:26:30.469 --> 04:26:30.479 align:start position:0%
prescription if it was part of their
 
04:26:32.550 --> 04:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
standard practice yes please put that on
 
04:26:33.830 --> 04:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
but if they have to bring another
 
04:26:35.269 --> 04:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
professional in i don't think that
 
04:26:38.710 --> 04:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:40.630 --> 04:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
representative knurk
 
04:26:42.710 --> 04:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
and i very much
 
04:26:44.950 --> 04:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate that and agree because
 
04:26:46.389 --> 04:26:46.399 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is there's really two
 
04:26:48.630 --> 04:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
steps the with the ophthalmologist or
 
04:26:49.990 --> 04:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
optometrist because they're both doing
 
04:26:51.750 --> 04:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
very much the same type of thing they're
 
04:26:53.510 --> 04:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
doing the refraction they're saying and
 
04:26:54.870 --> 04:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
that's why they call it a prescription
 
04:26:57.110 --> 04:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
for a spectacle lens it's a prescription
 
04:26:59.030 --> 04:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
for the lens and that tells you what the
 
04:27:00.550 --> 04:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
refractive power is if you have an
 
04:27:02.309 --> 04:27:02.319 align:start position:0%
astigmatism what the cylindrical
 
04:27:03.750 --> 04:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
correction is the axis of that
 
04:27:05.990 --> 04:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
cylindrical uh a prism if you're going
 
04:27:07.670 --> 04:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
to be having it because you have eyes
 
04:27:08.790 --> 04:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
that don't line up all that kind of
 
04:27:08.800 --> 04:27:09.590 align:start position:0%
that don't line up all that kind of
stuff

04:27:09.590 --> 04:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
04:27:11.269 --> 04:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
that's for the lens and that doesn't
 
04:27:13.349 --> 04:27:13.359 align:start position:0%
matter whether you have one eye two eyes
 
04:27:15.110 --> 04:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
whether they're this far apart or above
 
04:27:16.710 --> 04:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
each other that's a prescription to
 
04:27:18.790 --> 04:27:18.800 align:start position:0%
correct each eye that's why there's a
 
04:27:22.550 --> 04:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
prescription for od and for o l
 
04:27:25.269 --> 04:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
no yeah anyway so the thing is
 
04:27:27.750 --> 04:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
that's the prescription then yeah oh wes
 
04:27:29.269 --> 04:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
sinistra yeah sorry i forgot to go to
 
04:27:31.429 --> 04:27:31.439 align:start position:0%
the latin dextra and sinister so anyway
 
04:27:33.189 --> 04:27:33.199 align:start position:0%
the that's the prescription for the lens
 
04:27:35.670 --> 04:27:35.680 align:start position:0%
the next phase is fitting and that's a
 
04:27:37.830 --> 04:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
totally separate phenomena
 
04:27:39.990 --> 04:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
fitting is saying you've got a there's
 
04:27:41.510 --> 04:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
your spectacles could be big they could
 
04:27:43.510 --> 04:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
be little like these then you want to
 
04:27:45.030 --> 04:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
make sure they fit well for where the
 
04:27:47.269 --> 04:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
eyeballs are placed on the head and
 
04:27:49.429 --> 04:27:49.439 align:start position:0%
where the patient wishes to place them
 
04:27:51.429 --> 04:27:51.439 align:start position:0%
if i place these up here or if i place
 
04:27:54.229 --> 04:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
them down here that's a fitting issue
 
04:27:54.239 --> 04:27:55.349 align:start position:0%
them down here that's a fitting issue
and

04:27:55.349 --> 04:27:55.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:27:55.359 --> 04:27:56.550 align:start position:0%
and
basically

04:27:56.550 --> 04:27:56.560 align:start position:0%
basically
 
04:27:57.990 --> 04:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
for me as an orthopedist the same thing
 
04:27:59.990 --> 04:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
i might say i have a brace this is what
 
04:28:01.910 --> 04:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
i need to have it do medically then they
 
04:28:03.670 --> 04:28:03.680 align:start position:0%
go off to the brace maker and the brace
 
04:28:04.870 --> 04:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
maker is the one that takes the
 
04:28:06.550 --> 04:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
measurements of the limb
 
04:28:08.950 --> 04:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
or the spine in my case the torso and is
 
04:28:10.550 --> 04:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
then going to make that thing fit and if
 
04:28:11.990 --> 04:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't fit right it's their
 
04:28:14.149 --> 04:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
responsibility to make it right that's
 
04:28:16.309 --> 04:28:16.319 align:start position:0%
the person who's fitting
 
04:28:19.349 --> 04:28:19.359 align:start position:0%
and if we interpose uh if if i as the
 
04:28:21.510 --> 04:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
orthopedist gave these measurements and
 
04:28:23.429 --> 04:28:23.439 align:start position:0%
they're not correct then i'm going to
 
04:28:24.710 --> 04:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
lead him astray
 
04:28:26.309 --> 04:28:26.319 align:start position:0%
so i think it's perfectly reasonable to
 
04:28:27.750 --> 04:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
leave it this way
 
04:28:29.189 --> 04:28:29.199 align:start position:0%
i mean there may be a person who goes in
 
04:28:30.389 --> 04:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
and says hey you know i really want to
 
04:28:33.189 --> 04:28:33.199 align:start position:0%
order it online would you just hold the
 
04:28:35.349 --> 04:28:35.359 align:start position:0%
ruler up and measure it that's fine they
 
04:28:37.189 --> 04:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
can do that if they want to but they're
 
04:28:39.030 --> 04:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
not forced to do it it doesn't become
 
04:28:40.550 --> 04:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
part of a spectacle
 
04:28:42.389 --> 04:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
lens prescription
 
04:28:43.510 --> 04:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
and the bottom line is there are some
 
04:28:44.950 --> 04:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
things that just don't really work well
 
04:28:46.710 --> 04:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
online if you order clothes online they
 
04:28:48.149 --> 04:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
may not fit as well as if you've gone to
 
04:28:49.269 --> 04:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
a tailor if you're going to order a
 
04:28:51.910 --> 04:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
hearing aid online no way it may not fit
 
04:28:54.149 --> 04:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
really well into your ear because i have
 
04:28:56.149 --> 04:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
only a two millimeter canal on this side
 
04:28:57.670 --> 04:28:57.680 align:start position:0%
and a bigger one on this side and that
 
04:28:59.670 --> 04:28:59.680 align:start position:0%
was a real problem with fitting if i
 
04:29:01.189 --> 04:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
tried to order it online it's not going
 
04:29:04.710 --> 04:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
to work as well so this allows
 
04:29:06.149 --> 04:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
it still allows that other stuff to
 
04:29:07.590 --> 04:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
happen because there are ways to measure
 
04:29:09.349 --> 04:29:09.359 align:start position:0%
it but i think this amendment is
 
04:29:11.110 --> 04:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
perfectly fine i think the contact lens
 
04:29:12.149 --> 04:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
piece doesn't need to be there because
 
04:29:13.830 --> 04:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
the ftc is there but it does reinforce
 
04:29:16.070 --> 04:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
it in our rule or sorry statute and
 
04:29:17.510 --> 04:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
that's that's fine
 
04:29:21.990 --> 04:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:23.750 --> 04:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
anything else about representative
 
04:29:29.590 --> 04:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:31.189 --> 04:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
now let's look at representative
 
04:29:37.990 --> 04:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:38.000 --> 04:29:39.349 align:start position:0%
 
this

04:29:39.349 --> 04:29:39.359 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:29:41.990 --> 04:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
for myself was kind of a
 
04:29:44.309 --> 04:29:44.319 align:start position:0%
tough one because of conflicting points
 
04:29:46.309 --> 04:29:46.319 align:start position:0%
of view
 
04:29:48.149 --> 04:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
ideally the patient should have the best
 
04:29:51.189 --> 04:29:51.199 align:start position:0%
set of spectacles they can possibly have
 
04:29:52.950 --> 04:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there's a lot of folks
 
04:29:54.790 --> 04:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
that are on fixed incomes that cannot
 
04:29:57.429 --> 04:29:57.439 align:start position:0%
afford a cadillac but could like a chevy
 
04:29:59.510 --> 04:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
and the thing about a pupillary distance
 
04:30:01.110 --> 04:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
being provided
 
04:30:03.910 --> 04:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
it may not be accurate but for the vast
 
04:30:05.790 --> 04:30:05.800 align:start position:0%
majority of patients talking to
 
04:30:09.110 --> 04:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
authenticians it's probably okay
 
04:30:11.189 --> 04:30:11.199 align:start position:0%
for those who need to have progressive
 
04:30:13.590 --> 04:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
lenses or thick lenses precision becomes
 
04:30:13.600 --> 04:30:14.790 align:start position:0%
lenses or thick lenses precision becomes
important

04:30:14.790 --> 04:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
important
 
04:30:17.110 --> 04:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
so in listening to the testimony by the
 
04:30:19.030 --> 04:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
optician and as a dispenser i can
 
04:30:20.950 --> 04:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
understand what he's coming from
 
04:30:22.149 --> 04:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
once you write something on a
 
04:30:22.159 --> 04:30:23.429 align:start position:0%
once you write something on a
prescription

04:30:23.429 --> 04:30:23.439 align:start position:0%
prescription
 
04:30:25.830 --> 04:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
as a dispenser you're bound to what on
 
04:30:27.269 --> 04:30:27.279 align:start position:0%
is on that script
 
04:30:29.189 --> 04:30:29.199 align:start position:0%
so therefore if we don't allow the
 
04:30:31.269 --> 04:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
dispenser the authority to change and
 
04:30:32.870 --> 04:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
modify the pd
 
04:30:34.710 --> 04:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
we're locking them in and delaying
 
04:30:37.110 --> 04:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
patient care or getting the spectacles
 
04:30:39.110 --> 04:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
to the patient in a reasonable period of
 
04:30:39.120 --> 04:30:39.910 align:start position:0%
to the patient in a reasonable period of
time

04:30:39.910 --> 04:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:30:43.110 --> 04:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
so this allows the provider
 
04:30:45.269 --> 04:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
to provide the pd if the patient request
 
04:30:45.279 --> 04:30:46.630 align:start position:0%
to provide the pd if the patient request
it

04:30:46.630 --> 04:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:30:48.870 --> 04:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
and allows the dispenser to modify it to
 
04:30:51.830 --> 04:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
make it precise versus accurate
 
04:30:53.349 --> 04:30:53.359 align:start position:0%
so i think it was a good compromise all
 
04:30:55.590 --> 04:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
the way around to allow for
 
04:30:57.830 --> 04:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
the patients still have access to the pd
 
04:30:59.910 --> 04:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
if they desire to do that if they're
 
04:31:01.910 --> 04:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
shopping around and so forth aware of it
 
04:31:03.590 --> 04:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
they can ask for at the time which is
 
04:31:03.600 --> 04:31:04.469 align:start position:0%
they can ask for at the time which is
written

04:31:04.469 --> 04:31:04.479 align:start position:0%
written
 
04:31:07.030 --> 04:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
and it also allows for the dispenser to
 
04:31:11.670 --> 04:31:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:14.229 --> 04:31:14.239 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
04:31:15.830 --> 04:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:31:17.670 --> 04:31:17.680 align:start position:0%
i look at this from two perspectives and
 
04:31:19.830 --> 04:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate the perspective that
 
04:31:21.830 --> 04:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
represents merchant brought which is the
 
04:31:23.910 --> 04:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
commercial track and thinking of this
 
04:31:26.469 --> 04:31:26.479 align:start position:0%
particular problem in getting
 
04:31:28.229 --> 04:31:28.239 align:start position:0%
the chevy
 
04:31:30.309 --> 04:31:30.319 align:start position:0%
shall we speak instead of the cadillac
 
04:31:32.309 --> 04:31:32.319 align:start position:0%
to the consumer and i appreciate that
 
04:31:33.670 --> 04:31:33.680 align:start position:0%
i've been on the other end of the stick
 
04:31:33.680 --> 04:31:34.630 align:start position:0%
i've been on the other end of the stick
myself

04:31:34.630 --> 04:31:34.640 align:start position:0%
myself
 
04:31:38.790 --> 04:31:38.800 align:start position:0%
with my crazy eyes and trifocals um i
 
04:31:41.510 --> 04:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
pay a pretty penny
 
04:31:45.429 --> 04:31:45.439 align:start position:0%
nevertheless i'm looking at from the
 
04:31:48.070 --> 04:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
medical perspective
 
04:31:50.469 --> 04:31:50.479 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen in practice
 
04:31:50.479 --> 04:31:51.269 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen in practice
is

04:31:51.269 --> 04:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:31:53.910 --> 04:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
the patient comes into the office and it
 
04:31:56.870 --> 04:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
has to have a pd on it and well you may
 
04:31:58.309 --> 04:31:58.319 align:start position:0%
need to have this changed and it can be
 
04:32:00.229 --> 04:32:00.239 align:start position:0%
changed and so forth what's going to
 
04:32:02.149 --> 04:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
happen it's going to go to
 
04:32:03.910 --> 04:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
not every ophthalmologist i mean not
 
04:32:06.630 --> 04:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
every optometrist or optician and not
 
04:32:08.950 --> 04:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
every online facility but they're going
 
04:32:11.670 --> 04:32:11.680 align:start position:0%
to take that as gospel truth
 
04:32:13.349 --> 04:32:13.359 align:start position:0%
they're going well if we got one here
 
04:32:15.189 --> 04:32:15.199 align:start position:0%
why should i measure it again
 
04:32:17.429 --> 04:32:17.439 align:start position:0%
we've got 17 people in the waiting room
 
04:32:19.510 --> 04:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
got to take care of them
 
04:32:21.670 --> 04:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
so here's a pupillary distance you take
 
04:32:23.269 --> 04:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
it uh and
 
04:32:24.149 --> 04:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
on a
 
04:32:26.309 --> 04:32:26.319 align:start position:0%
next customer
 
04:32:26.319 --> 04:32:27.429 align:start position:0%
next customer
so

04:32:27.429 --> 04:32:27.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:32:27.439 --> 04:32:28.870 align:start position:0%
so
to

04:32:28.870 --> 04:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:32:30.710 --> 04:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
put it on the prescription
 
04:32:32.830 --> 04:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
even though there is the
 
04:32:36.149 --> 04:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
possibility okay of it once it's on a
 
04:32:39.110 --> 04:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
and society takes the physician's
 
04:32:39.120 --> 04:32:40.630 align:start position:0%
and society takes the physician's
prescription

04:32:40.630 --> 04:32:40.640 align:start position:0%
prescription
 
04:32:43.830 --> 04:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:46.149 --> 04:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
for the most part
 
04:32:47.990 --> 04:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
okay and i think that's where the
 
04:32:50.630 --> 04:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
imprimatur of having that being the
 
04:32:50.640 --> 04:32:51.910 align:start position:0%
imprimatur of having that being the
primary

04:32:51.910 --> 04:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
primary
 
04:32:55.030 --> 04:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
basis to proceed
 
04:32:57.910 --> 04:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
although there some people will do fine
 
04:32:59.910 --> 04:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh we also know that there are
 
04:32:59.920 --> 04:33:01.429 align:start position:0%
uh we also know that there are
prescriptions

04:33:01.429 --> 04:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
prescriptions
 
04:33:03.189 --> 04:33:03.199 align:start position:0%
that you can take a generic which don't
 
04:33:05.429 --> 04:33:05.439 align:start position:0%
work as well
 
04:33:05.439 --> 04:33:06.310 align:start position:0%
work as well
okay

04:33:06.310 --> 04:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:33:08.070 --> 04:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
uh and we we say
 
04:33:10.390 --> 04:33:10.400 align:start position:0%
no not generic for that reason
 
04:33:12.551 --> 04:33:12.561 align:start position:0%
and pharmacists are very familiar with
 
04:33:16.390 --> 04:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
what's called a narrow therapeutic range
 
04:33:16.400 --> 04:33:17.590 align:start position:0%
what's called a narrow therapeutic range
medication

04:33:17.590 --> 04:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
medication
 
04:33:19.510 --> 04:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
typically uh thyroxine if you have a
 
04:33:20.949 --> 04:33:20.959 align:start position:0%
thyroid disease
 
04:33:23.029 --> 04:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
it has to be brand
 
04:33:26.230 --> 04:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
because the generic for a vastness a
 
04:33:28.629 --> 04:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
vast significant number
 
04:33:32.310 --> 04:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't work uh so yes you can get the
 
04:33:32.320 --> 04:33:33.349 align:start position:0%
doesn't work uh so yes you can get the
generic

04:33:33.349 --> 04:33:33.359 align:start position:0%
generic
 
04:33:35.349 --> 04:33:35.359 align:start position:0%
uh the chevy form but it's not going to
 
04:33:36.551 --> 04:33:36.561 align:start position:0%
do the job
 
04:33:38.551 --> 04:33:38.561 align:start position:0%
and i don't want to put the medical
 
04:33:38.561 --> 04:33:39.670 align:start position:0%
and i don't want to put the medical
community

04:33:39.670 --> 04:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
community
 
04:33:41.029 --> 04:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
in the position
 
04:33:41.039 --> 04:33:42.470 align:start position:0%
in the position
of

04:33:42.470 --> 04:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:33:44.789 --> 04:33:44.799 align:start position:0%
pretending that this is really the best
 
04:33:46.869 --> 04:33:46.879 align:start position:0%
care that i can provide for you
 
04:33:52.709 --> 04:33:52.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:54.390 --> 04:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
representative weber had her hand up
 
04:33:54.400 --> 04:33:58.310 align:start position:0%
representative weber had her hand up
first

04:33:58.310 --> 04:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:59.750 --> 04:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to weigh in on either of
 
04:34:01.990 --> 04:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
those issues but i'm i am going to say
 
04:34:03.590 --> 04:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
that this
 
04:34:06.949 --> 04:34:06.959 align:start position:0%
express a concern that this
 
04:34:09.429 --> 04:34:09.439 align:start position:0%
makes significant changes in the contact
 
04:34:09.439 --> 04:34:10.789 align:start position:0%
makes significant changes in the contact
lens

04:34:10.789 --> 04:34:10.799 align:start position:0%
lens
 
04:34:14.869 --> 04:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
portion as well as the spectacle portion
 
04:34:16.230 --> 04:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:34:16.240 --> 04:34:17.670 align:start position:0%
of the
statute

04:34:17.670 --> 04:34:17.680 align:start position:0%
statute
 
04:34:20.470 --> 04:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
and i don't remember maybe somebody can
 
04:34:23.189 --> 04:34:23.199 align:start position:0%
enlighten me that we had any testimony
 
04:34:25.990 --> 04:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
at all about contact lenses or the
 
04:34:28.310 --> 04:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity for anybody to know that
 
04:34:29.990 --> 04:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
they might want to weigh in about
 
04:34:32.709 --> 04:34:32.719 align:start position:0%
changes having to do with contact lenses
 
04:34:34.629 --> 04:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
and once again i'm a little concerned
 
04:34:34.639 --> 04:34:35.510 align:start position:0%
and once again i'm a little concerned
about

04:34:35.510 --> 04:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:34:37.670 --> 04:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
lack of germaness
 
04:34:39.510 --> 04:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
i will say the other thing that i'm
 
04:34:41.830 --> 04:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
concerned that i will just note is if
 
04:34:44.869 --> 04:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
this is the directive we go in
 
04:34:47.590 --> 04:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
on line 16 of the leon amendment there
 
04:34:49.750 --> 04:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
is a comma after the word cylinder and
 
04:34:52.230 --> 04:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
before the word access axis that i think
 
04:34:55.029 --> 04:34:55.039 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be there
 
04:34:57.269 --> 04:34:57.279 align:start position:0%
or representative uh canaric you want to
 
04:34:59.429 --> 04:34:59.439 align:start position:0%
clarify yes actually because i quit i
 
04:35:01.109 --> 04:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
was working with optometrists and i
 
04:35:02.949 --> 04:35:02.959 align:start position:0%
questioned that when that came in that
 
04:35:04.869 --> 04:35:04.879 align:start position:0%
original amendment
 
04:35:07.830 --> 04:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
and it actually is sloppy wording period
 
04:35:08.949 --> 04:35:08.959 align:start position:0%
all of it is
 
04:35:12.390 --> 04:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
when you have a astigmatism you have not
 
04:35:14.470 --> 04:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
a spherical error but a cylindrical
 
04:35:14.480 --> 04:35:15.269 align:start position:0%
a spherical error but a cylindrical
error

04:35:15.269 --> 04:35:15.279 align:start position:0%
error
 
04:35:16.629 --> 04:35:16.639 align:start position:0%
and so you actually have to have a
 
04:35:18.949 --> 04:35:18.959 align:start position:0%
cylindrical refraction but then you have
 
04:35:21.029 --> 04:35:21.039 align:start position:0%
to know the axis of that cylinder in
 
04:35:22.310 --> 04:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
other words does it go straight up and
 
04:35:23.990 --> 04:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
down or does it go across
 
04:35:25.189 --> 04:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
and it really
 
04:35:27.670 --> 04:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
probably should be saying the cylinder
 
04:35:30.230 --> 04:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
refraction and the cylinder axis but
 
04:35:31.750 --> 04:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
it's this is the length what the
 
04:35:33.510 --> 04:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
language that was in there
 
04:35:36.470 --> 04:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
was uh the optometrist said jargon and
 
04:35:37.910 --> 04:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
what they would accept is just to say
 
04:35:39.429 --> 04:35:39.439 align:start position:0%
the cylinder comma that means the
 
04:35:41.590 --> 04:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
refractive power axis that means the
 
04:35:43.510 --> 04:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
axis of it they were comfortable that
 
04:35:45.429 --> 04:35:45.439 align:start position:0%
this would not be confusing we could
 
04:35:46.789 --> 04:35:46.799 align:start position:0%
have made it all kinds of better talking
 
04:35:48.390 --> 04:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
about for example they uh
 
04:35:50.470 --> 04:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
the uh if you have a prism the prism
 
04:35:52.551 --> 04:35:52.561 align:start position:0%
base orientation
 
04:35:53.910 --> 04:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
strength all that stuff but you don't
 
04:35:55.189 --> 04:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
need to put that in there they said it
 
04:35:56.709 --> 04:35:56.719 align:start position:0%
was okay because what this is saying is
 
04:35:58.629 --> 04:35:58.639 align:start position:0%
what you cannot change
 
04:35:58.639 --> 04:35:59.349 align:start position:0%
what you cannot change
so

04:35:59.349 --> 04:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:36:01.670 --> 04:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
it is that it does
 
04:36:04.150 --> 04:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
is needed yeah it makes it better my
 
04:36:05.910 --> 04:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
apologies that's okay i didn't know
 
04:36:08.070 --> 04:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
either until i asked them so it's okay
 
04:36:08.080 --> 04:36:09.109 align:start position:0%
either until i asked them so it's okay
the

04:36:09.109 --> 04:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:36:11.269 --> 04:36:11.279 align:start position:0%
the clerk pointed out to me that uh
 
04:36:13.670 --> 04:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
contact lenses is in the original bill
 
04:36:15.670 --> 04:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
so mention of it in an amendment may not
 
04:36:19.510 --> 04:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily be non-germane i saw
 
04:36:21.109 --> 04:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
here representative delemus you wish to
 
04:36:21.119 --> 04:36:22.470 align:start position:0%
here representative delemus you wish to
speak

04:36:22.470 --> 04:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
speak
 
04:36:25.189 --> 04:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman um actually
 
04:36:27.590 --> 04:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to chime in on
 
04:36:30.230 --> 04:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
representative merchants amendment
 
04:36:33.510 --> 04:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
and say that i really like it i think i
 
04:36:37.590 --> 04:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
like it because the patient can request
 
04:36:40.390 --> 04:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
the pupillary distance and
 
04:36:44.150 --> 04:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
i did request pupillary distance from my
 
04:36:45.910 --> 04:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
ophthalmologist when i went to get my
 
04:36:47.590 --> 04:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
prescription which i actually have in my
 
04:36:49.590 --> 04:36:49.600 align:start position:0%
pocketbook right now and that pupillary
 
04:36:53.269 --> 04:36:53.279 align:start position:0%
distance box it was empty and as i said
 
04:36:56.949 --> 04:36:56.959 align:start position:0%
before that i had to go sneak in to
 
04:36:58.709 --> 04:36:58.719 align:start position:0%
the other side of the thing and had a
 
04:37:01.590 --> 04:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
friend that actually does the the
 
04:37:04.551 --> 04:37:04.561 align:start position:0%
measurements and did my eyes for me but
 
04:37:07.109 --> 04:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
i if the doctor had just given me the
 
04:37:09.109 --> 04:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
distance because i can't see if i take
 
04:37:11.189 --> 04:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
these glasses off and i take a ruler and
 
04:37:12.949 --> 04:37:12.959 align:start position:0%
i put the ruler up to my eyes and i'm
 
04:37:14.949 --> 04:37:14.959 align:start position:0%
trying to see the distance between my
 
04:37:17.189 --> 04:37:17.199 align:start position:0%
pupils i'm like i don't can't see a darn
 
04:37:20.230 --> 04:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
thing so it's
 
04:37:22.310 --> 04:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
i would trust a doctor it can actually
 
04:37:25.429 --> 04:37:25.439 align:start position:0%
like maybe put a ruler up there and give
 
04:37:28.470 --> 04:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
me the distance upon my request if i
 
04:37:28.480 --> 04:37:29.349 align:start position:0%
me the distance upon my request if i
don't

04:37:29.349 --> 04:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
don't
 
04:37:31.510 --> 04:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
feel i need it or i don't want to get it
 
04:37:31.520 --> 04:37:32.310 align:start position:0%
feel i need it or i don't want to get it
from

04:37:32.310 --> 04:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:37:35.750 --> 04:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
the doctor the prescriber then i don't
 
04:37:38.789 --> 04:37:38.799 align:start position:0%
need to ask and and the reason that i
 
04:37:41.269 --> 04:37:41.279 align:start position:0%
did ask was because i did buy these
 
04:37:41.279 --> 04:37:42.390 align:start position:0%
did ask was because i did buy these
online

04:37:42.390 --> 04:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
online
 
04:37:43.510 --> 04:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:37:45.189 --> 04:37:45.199 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
04:37:46.310 --> 04:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:37:47.830 --> 04:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
um i
 
04:37:49.910 --> 04:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
i really like
 
04:37:51.109 --> 04:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
the merchant
 
04:37:53.990 --> 04:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
amendment because
 
04:37:56.629 --> 04:37:56.639 align:start position:0%
there's two two types two categories of
 
04:37:58.869 --> 04:37:58.879 align:start position:0%
people who would be interested
 
04:38:00.470 --> 04:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
in um
 
04:38:03.269 --> 04:38:03.279 align:start position:0%
not going to the
 
04:38:05.670 --> 04:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
glasses dispensary that's at the
 
04:38:07.670 --> 04:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
doctor's office
 
04:38:09.029 --> 04:38:09.039 align:start position:0%
they are either
 
04:38:11.269 --> 04:38:11.279 align:start position:0%
to order online
 
04:38:13.750 --> 04:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
and we all understand that
 
04:38:15.750 --> 04:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
that that's not ideal but that's
 
04:38:18.150 --> 04:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
financially for people who who either
 
04:38:20.070 --> 04:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
don't have the money to order it or
 
04:38:22.310 --> 04:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
don't have lions to buy the glasses for
 
04:38:22.320 --> 04:38:23.510 align:start position:0%
don't have lions to buy the glasses for
them

04:38:23.510 --> 04:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:38:25.109 --> 04:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
that's where they are they've got to
 
04:38:27.269 --> 04:38:27.279 align:start position:0%
order it at something they can afford
 
04:38:29.429 --> 04:38:29.439 align:start position:0%
they need that pupillary distance which
 
04:38:32.629 --> 04:38:32.639 align:start position:0%
takes oh i don't know 10 seconds to make
 
04:38:35.189 --> 04:38:35.199 align:start position:0%
of the other person who's going to go to
 
04:38:38.070 --> 04:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
a cheaper place to make their glasses
 
04:38:39.750 --> 04:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
they don't need it
 
04:38:41.590 --> 04:38:41.600 align:start position:0%
and now they have gizmos that are so
 
04:38:41.600 --> 04:38:42.470 align:start position:0%
and now they have gizmos that are so
quick

04:38:42.470 --> 04:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
quick
 
04:38:44.709 --> 04:38:44.719 align:start position:0%
uh when i was waiting after my surgery
 
04:38:46.470 --> 04:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
to get these
 
04:38:48.070 --> 04:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
seven or eight hundred dollar glasses i
 
04:38:49.510 --> 04:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
went and got some el chipos for a
 
04:38:51.990 --> 04:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
hundred and they they you know these are
 
04:38:54.070 --> 04:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
not highly trained people
 
04:38:57.269 --> 04:38:57.279 align:start position:0%
uh and they measured measured me with a
 
04:38:59.189 --> 04:38:59.199 align:start position:0%
cute little gadget
 
04:39:02.869 --> 04:39:02.879 align:start position:0%
so i think it's really important to
 
04:39:05.189 --> 04:39:05.199 align:start position:0%
guarantee that people have the right to
 
04:39:07.670 --> 04:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
get that pupillary distance
 
04:39:07.680 --> 04:39:08.629 align:start position:0%
get that pupillary distance
because

04:39:08.629 --> 04:39:08.639 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:39:11.029 --> 04:39:11.039 align:start position:0%
not everybody can afford
 
04:39:13.429 --> 04:39:13.439 align:start position:0%
what most of us can afford
 
04:39:15.590 --> 04:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
and so i think it's very prejudicial to
 
04:39:17.670 --> 04:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
say oh no you're not getting the
 
04:39:23.510 --> 04:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:26.869 --> 04:39:26.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:28.949 --> 04:39:28.959 align:start position:0%
just as a matter of clarification to my
 
04:39:31.269 --> 04:39:31.279 align:start position:0%
original point
 
04:39:33.670 --> 04:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
yes fitting contact lenses was in the
 
04:39:35.109 --> 04:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
04:39:37.670 --> 04:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
but it was a replace all the the
 
04:39:39.750 --> 04:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
language in the original bill is exactly
 
04:39:42.470 --> 04:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
the same as the existing statute and we
 
04:39:45.430 --> 04:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
didn't talk about contact lenses at all
 
04:39:47.750 --> 04:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
it was i believe it was put in there as
 
04:39:49.510 --> 04:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
a way of getting from section one to
 
04:39:51.670 --> 04:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
section three which did have the
 
04:39:53.670 --> 04:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
addition of the interpupillary distance
 
04:39:56.230 --> 04:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
so i'm still i'm still concerned about
 
04:40:00.830 --> 04:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:03.590 --> 04:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
um representative leon
 
04:40:06.150 --> 04:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um while i am
 
04:40:07.910 --> 04:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
concerned about asking different
 
04:40:10.868 --> 04:40:10.878 align:start position:0%
professions to cross train we can we can
 
04:40:12.788 --> 04:40:12.798 align:start position:0%
measure our own intrapupillary distance
 
04:40:15.750 --> 04:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
if we can see ourselves in the mirror so
 
04:40:18.470 --> 04:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
i i do like the merchant amendment how
 
04:40:20.550 --> 04:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
it can be modified and making it so that
 
04:40:22.470 --> 04:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
it is more flexible
 
04:40:24.390 --> 04:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
and if that's the way we ended up going
 
04:40:28.628 --> 04:40:28.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:30.788 --> 04:40:30.798 align:start position:0%
are you withdrawing your amendment
 
04:40:30.798 --> 04:40:33.830 align:start position:0%
are you withdrawing your amendment
um

04:40:33.830 --> 04:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:36.390 --> 04:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
or you're just happy i
 
04:40:39.350 --> 04:40:39.360 align:start position:0%
there's different ways to skin a cat um
 
04:40:41.430 --> 04:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
and it's hard to say that a professional
 
04:40:43.350 --> 04:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
can't do what we can do with an app or a
 
04:40:43.360 --> 04:40:44.868 align:start position:0%
can't do what we can do with an app or a
ruler

04:40:44.868 --> 04:40:44.878 align:start position:0%
ruler
 
04:40:44.878 --> 04:40:46.310 align:start position:0%
ruler
um

04:40:46.310 --> 04:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:48.310 --> 04:40:48.320 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't skin a cat if i was a
 
04:40:50.310 --> 04:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
professional but what would you like to
 
04:40:52.230 --> 04:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
do with your amendment well i guess i
 
04:40:53.750 --> 04:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
haven't submitted my amendment yet all
 
04:40:55.590 --> 04:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
right we haven't we haven't made a
 
04:40:58.150 --> 04:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
motion or anything we haven't
 
04:41:01.590 --> 04:41:01.600 align:start position:0%
and what i'm asking is do you want us to
 
04:41:01.600 --> 04:41:03.030 align:start position:0%
and what i'm asking is do you want us to
um

04:41:03.030 --> 04:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:06.470 --> 04:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:09.270 --> 04:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
representative canark with respect to
 
04:41:11.190 --> 04:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
the issue of the contact lenses although
 
04:41:13.350 --> 04:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
it was not part of the original bill and
 
04:41:15.590 --> 04:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
was not noticed as such we did have
 
04:41:18.310 --> 04:41:18.320 align:start position:0%
testimony about the contact lenses
 
04:41:20.628 --> 04:41:20.638 align:start position:0%
that's rosemary rungs amendment that she
 
04:41:21.750 --> 04:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
brought in
 
04:41:22.788 --> 04:41:22.798 align:start position:0%
and what
 
04:41:24.868 --> 04:41:24.878 align:start position:0%
representative leon did was take her
 
04:41:27.750 --> 04:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
amendment and blend it so it was covered
 
04:41:30.150 --> 04:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
in testimony though it was not a notice
 
04:41:34.628 --> 04:41:34.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:37.270 --> 04:41:37.280 align:start position:0%

about to pass 60 days after passage
 
04:45:27.600 --> 04:45:28.390 align:start position:0%
about to pass 60 days after passage
so

04:45:28.390 --> 04:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:45:29.830 --> 04:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
i wondered
 
04:45:31.670 --> 04:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
who took precedence because i think
 
04:45:33.750 --> 04:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
sooner's better than later
 
04:45:33.760 --> 04:45:35.670 align:start position:0%
sooner's better than later
well

04:45:35.670 --> 04:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
well

and this was to provide
 
04:45:46.150 --> 04:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
an educational opportunity from the
 
04:45:47.990 --> 04:45:48.000 align:start position:0%

house bill 1488 expanding the

prohibition against discrimination based
 
04:48:01.110 --> 04:48:01.120 align:start position:0%
on an individual's

04:48:48.390 --> 04:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
and if you look at it it is remarkable
 
04:48:51.190 --> 04:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
in its brevity
 
04:48:52.788 --> 04:48:52.798 align:start position:0%
line two
 
04:48:55.430 --> 04:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
no health care provider here's a change
 
04:48:58.230 --> 04:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
or any other entity identified in
 
04:49:02.470 --> 04:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
paragraph four well i looked it up
 
04:49:04.310 --> 04:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
and a number of people are listed in
 
04:49:06.708 --> 04:49:06.718 align:start position:0%
that paragraph four primary care
 
04:49:08.628 --> 04:49:08.638 align:start position:0%
physicians nurses other appropriate
 
04:49:10.628 --> 04:49:10.638 align:start position:0%

researchers
 
04:49:17.590 --> 04:49:17.600 align:start position:0%
none of those therefore according to the
 
04:49:19.990 --> 04:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
bill if passed shall discriminate
 
04:49:22.868 --> 04:49:22.878 align:start position:0%
against any person solely
 
04:49:24.628 --> 04:49:24.638 align:start position:0%
because that person elects not to
 
04:49:27.670 --> 04:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
participate in the immunization registry
 
04:49:29.990 --> 04:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
that's the bill
 
04:49:36.470 --> 04:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:39.110 --> 04:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
representative woods uh just uh not that
 
04:49:41.030 --> 04:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
people haven't read that it's
 
04:49:43.670 --> 04:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
the registry not the vaccination and
 
04:49:46.230 --> 04:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
other people have contacted me
 
04:49:48.708 --> 04:49:48.718 align:start position:0%
with that misunderstanding so
 
04:49:50.948 --> 04:49:50.958 align:start position:0%
this is just the non-participation in
 
04:49:52.910 --> 04:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
the registry not the
 
04:49:56.628 --> 04:49:56.638 align:start position:0%
non-participation in vaccination
 
04:49:59.830 --> 04:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
and for the record 253
 
04:50:01.670 --> 04:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
people signed in in favor of the bill
 
04:50:04.550 --> 04:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
and 47 against
 
04:50:10.868 --> 04:50:10.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:13.190 --> 04:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
looking for someone to
 
04:50:19.510 --> 04:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:21.590 --> 04:50:21.600 align:start position:0%

04:50:25.830 --> 04:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
um unless we have somebody on this side
 
04:50:31.270 --> 04:50:31.280 align:start position:0%

not being a writer in my physics

background the only thing i learned to
 
04:51:33.670 --> 04:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
write were equations so i hope you'll
 
04:51:35.430 --> 04:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
all be able to understand it
 
04:51:37.270 --> 04:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
we just don't want to read the blurb and
 
04:51:39.030 --> 04:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
think chaos

04:54:33.910 --> 04:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
to write another blurb okay wonderful
 
04:54:35.190 --> 04:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:54:37.590 --> 04:54:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh representative leon uh defend your
 
04:54:40.310 --> 04:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
motion on interim study please um thank
 
04:54:42.788 --> 04:54:42.798 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman i think that we had a
 
04:54:44.948 --> 04:54:44.958 align:start position:0%
lot of good discussion around this
 
04:54:47.670 --> 04:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of open issues around
 
04:54:49.990 --> 04:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
that section that was added to law but
 
04:54:52.230 --> 04:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
as we move out of this emergency
 
04:54:54.550 --> 04:54:54.560 align:start position:0%
figuring out how to change it so that we
 
04:54:55.910 --> 04:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
don't get rid of the protections that
 
04:54:59.190 --> 04:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
were afforded and don't cause more
 
04:55:01.750 --> 04:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
confusion by getting rid of this now
 
04:55:03.670 --> 04:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
seems to be the best way to do this by
 
04:55:05.670 --> 04:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
doing an interim study we can figure out
 
04:55:07.350 --> 04:55:07.360 align:start position:0%
how to address these sorts of things
 
04:55:09.430 --> 04:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
going forward and how
 
04:55:09.440 --> 04:55:10.788 align:start position:0%
going forward and how
[Music]

04:55:10.788 --> 04:55:10.798 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:55:12.230 --> 04:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
basically how to address the concerns
 
04:55:13.990 --> 04:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
that were raised in that hearing but
 
04:55:16.230 --> 04:55:16.240 align:start position:0%
right now there's nothing that we really
 
04:55:18.310 --> 04:55:18.320 align:start position:0%
need to do because that protection was
 
04:55:20.788 --> 04:55:20.798 align:start position:0%
afforded during the covet crisis
 
04:55:22.390 --> 04:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
and trying to figure out some way to
 
04:55:24.150 --> 04:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
pull out that pull that out right now
 
04:55:26.628 --> 04:55:26.638 align:start position:0%
just isn't the best way to go so interim
 
04:55:28.708 --> 04:55:28.718 align:start position:0%
study is my preferred
 
04:55:28.718 --> 04:55:29.830 align:start position:0%
study is my preferred
path

04:55:29.830 --> 04:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
path
 
04:55:31.830 --> 04:55:31.840 align:start position:0%

04:58:22.390 --> 04:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
everybody have one because i think i
 
04:58:25.590 --> 04:58:25.600 align:start position:0%
have a two of them
 
04:58:33.190 --> 04:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:35.510 --> 04:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
this is an extra one if anybody doesn't
 
04:58:36.708 --> 04:58:36.718 align:start position:0%
have one
 
04:58:39.590 --> 04:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
i mean it's an extra one even if they do
 
04:58:45.030 --> 04:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:50.310 --> 04:58:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:52.510 --> 04:58:52.520 align:start position:0%
proposed we have
 
04:58:55.350 --> 04:58:55.360 align:start position:0%
435 people in favor
 
04:58:57.510 --> 04:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
and 14
 
04:59:02.550 --> 04:59:02.560 align:start position:0%
144 signed in against 435 to 144.
 
04:59:02.560 --> 04:59:07.350 align:start position:0%
144 signed in against 435 to 144.
wow

04:59:07.350 --> 04:59:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:10.150 --> 04:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
uh yeah we can representative leon would
 
04:59:12.310 --> 04:59:12.320 align:start position:0%
you speak to the amendment it really
 
04:59:13.910 --> 04:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
shortens the bill
 
04:59:16.708 --> 04:59:16.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um this may seem
 
04:59:18.948 --> 04:59:18.958 align:start position:0%
like a very large pivot from the bill
 
04:59:20.868 --> 04:59:20.878 align:start position:0%
but almost all of those words are
 
04:59:24.070 --> 04:59:24.080 align:start position:0%
included on page one lines three through
 
04:59:26.868 --> 04:59:26.878 align:start position:0%
nine of the original bill
 
04:59:28.708 --> 04:59:28.718 align:start position:0%
because this now prohibits the state of
 
04:59:30.070 --> 04:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and its political
 
04:59:32.070 --> 04:59:32.080 align:start position:0%
subdivisions from requiring businesses
 
04:59:33.430 --> 04:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
to check this
 
04:59:35.750 --> 04:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
the word customer was added as well so
 
04:59:38.310 --> 04:59:38.320 align:start position:0%
that the state or any political
 
04:59:40.310 --> 04:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
subdivision if things follow what we
 
04:59:42.150 --> 04:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
have in this committee on the floor and
 
04:59:43.510 --> 04:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
we keep the medical freedom and
 
04:59:45.270 --> 04:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
immunizations the no it would not be
 
04:59:47.430 --> 04:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
necessary but if the medical freedoms
 
04:59:49.110 --> 04:59:49.120 align:start position:0%
and immunization
 
04:59:51.430 --> 04:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
is removed which is a possibility on the
 
04:59:53.590 --> 04:59:53.600 align:start position:0%
floor then this would be necessary
 
04:59:56.070 --> 04:59:56.080 align:start position:0%
great answer
 
04:59:57.750 --> 04:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
any other questions discussion
 
04:59:59.510 --> 04:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
05:00:02.390 --> 05:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
is this a substitute or just for one
 
05:00:04.830 --> 05:00:04.840 align:start position:0%
paragraph is this a yeah does this
 
05:00:11.750 --> 05:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:17.830 --> 05:00:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:19.190 --> 05:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
i'm just
 
05:00:22.310 --> 05:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
needing a little bit of a clarification
 
05:00:24.070 --> 05:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
it says the state's not going to require
 
05:00:26.070 --> 05:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
any business to require a check for
 
05:00:27.990 --> 05:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
possession of any documentation of
 
05:00:29.910 --> 05:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
certifying vaccination or immunity
 
05:00:29.920 --> 05:00:31.190 align:start position:0%
certifying vaccination or immunity
status

05:00:31.190 --> 05:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
status
 
05:00:32.868 --> 05:00:32.878 align:start position:0%
i know that the federal government
 
05:00:36.390 --> 05:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
requires all airlines to check those
 
05:00:36.400 --> 05:00:38.230 align:start position:0%
requires all airlines to check those
things

05:00:38.230 --> 05:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
things
 
05:00:38.240 --> 05:00:39.830 align:start position:0%
things
so

05:00:39.830 --> 05:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:00:43.830 --> 05:00:43.840 align:start position:0%
i'm just a little concerned about
 
05:00:45.990 --> 05:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
this shouldn't didn't have any problem
 
05:00:47.430 --> 05:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
with that because
 
05:00:49.750 --> 05:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
that's federal as a state
 
05:00:54.390 --> 05:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering if there are any
 
05:00:54.400 --> 05:00:57.910 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering if there are any
circumstances

05:00:57.910 --> 05:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:59.430 --> 05:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
where this would be
 
05:01:02.070 --> 05:01:02.080 align:start position:0%
inappropriate i i certainly agree it it
 
05:01:05.030 --> 05:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
simplifies matters enormously
 
05:01:08.550 --> 05:01:08.560 align:start position:0%
and it preserves the rights of
 
05:01:11.030 --> 05:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
private businesses which i'm for it's
 
05:01:13.430 --> 05:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
just it's a huge leap and i'm trying to
 
05:01:17.750 --> 05:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:19.830 --> 05:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
representative leon would you
 
05:01:21.830 --> 05:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
choose to answer please yes thank you mr
 
05:01:23.590 --> 05:01:23.600 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for
 
05:01:25.510 --> 05:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
for those uh question statements in
 
05:01:27.350 --> 05:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
order to clarify this more
 
05:01:29.110 --> 05:01:29.120 align:start position:0%
this simply says the state and its
 
05:01:30.948 --> 05:01:30.958 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions can't require
 
05:01:33.590 --> 05:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
that it does nothing to stop the federal
 
05:01:35.350 --> 05:01:35.360 align:start position:0%
government from requiring it it does
 
05:01:37.910 --> 05:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
nothing to stop cms from requiring it
 
05:01:40.150 --> 05:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
all it says is that the state can't put
 
05:01:42.310 --> 05:01:42.320 align:start position:0%
this mandate on businesses so the state
 
05:01:45.110 --> 05:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
or its subdivisions cannot and follow-up
 
05:01:47.830 --> 05:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
question follow-up yes um could you
 
05:01:51.110 --> 05:01:51.120 align:start position:0%
remind me what rsa141c20a
 
05:01:51.120 --> 05:01:52.150 align:start position:0%
remind me what rsa141c20a
is

05:01:52.150 --> 05:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:01:55.670 --> 05:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
yes that's childhood immunizations so a
 
05:01:58.470 --> 05:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
childcare business a care facility
 
05:02:00.150 --> 05:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
can still be required to check for that
 
05:02:02.230 --> 05:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
immunization status okay so this is
 
05:02:03.750 --> 05:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
kovitz specific
 
05:02:19.750 --> 05:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:22.628 --> 05:02:22.638 align:start position:0%
this also does not stop any business
 
05:02:24.150 --> 05:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
from doing this on their own is that
 
05:02:24.160 --> 05:02:25.190 align:start position:0%
from doing this on their own is that
correct

05:02:25.190 --> 05:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:02:27.670 --> 05:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
that is correct it just does not allow
 
05:02:29.350 --> 05:02:29.360 align:start position:0%
does not make the state an agent to
 
05:02:31.030 --> 05:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
force them to check for this they can do
 
05:02:33.030 --> 05:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
what they choose
 
05:02:35.910 --> 05:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
representative knurk uh i'd like to hear
 
05:02:38.550 --> 05:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
from dhhs regarding
 
05:02:41.270 --> 05:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
accreditation issues because
 
05:02:43.590 --> 05:02:43.600 align:start position:0%
part of their accreditation is to check
 
05:02:45.830 --> 05:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
that a facility
 
05:02:48.390 --> 05:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
is following uh federal mandates and
 
05:02:49.670 --> 05:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
granted this
 
05:02:51.190 --> 05:02:51.200 align:start position:0%
this is still
 
05:02:53.190 --> 05:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
a federal it's a federal but the state
 
05:02:54.868 --> 05:02:54.878 align:start position:0%
is the one that actually accredits the
 
05:02:54.878 --> 05:02:55.990 align:start position:0%
is the one that actually accredits the
hospital

05:02:55.990 --> 05:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
05:02:57.510 --> 05:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
or the nursing home and makes sure that
 
05:02:59.030 --> 05:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
they are following
 
05:03:01.030 --> 05:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
the see the appropriate mandates that's
 
05:03:03.190 --> 05:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
what they told us before so i would
 
05:03:04.628 --> 05:03:04.638 align:start position:0%
assume either
 
05:03:07.190 --> 05:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
perhaps paula minahan or john williams
 
05:03:09.750 --> 05:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
could clarify for us will this interfere
 
05:03:11.590 --> 05:03:11.600 align:start position:0%
with the ability for us to get
 
05:03:14.470 --> 05:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
accreditation of our facilities
 
05:03:16.070 --> 05:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
because they would not be able to do
 
05:03:17.590 --> 05:03:17.600 align:start position:0%
their accreditation work because they
 
05:03:19.510 --> 05:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
couldn't ask about whether or not
 
05:03:21.030 --> 05:03:21.040 align:start position:0%
they're doing vaccinations to be
 
05:03:24.230 --> 05:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
compliant with the federal mandates
 
05:03:27.030 --> 05:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
they're consulting and one or both and
 
05:03:29.110 --> 05:03:29.120 align:start position:0%
maybe even abby rogers for the hat trick
 
05:03:31.110 --> 05:03:31.120 align:start position:0%
would come up and
 
05:03:36.948 --> 05:03:36.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:39.110 --> 05:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
first see the amendment from someone
 
05:03:50.390 --> 05:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:52.628 --> 05:03:52.638 align:start position:0%
they're having a caucus
 
05:03:59.750 --> 05:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:02.390 --> 05:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
use this time to think of the committee
 
05:04:25.910 --> 05:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:28.628 --> 05:04:28.638 align:start position:0%
one of the three is at the table one
 
05:04:28.638 --> 05:04:30.150 align:start position:0%
one of the three is at the table one
fled

05:04:30.150 --> 05:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
fled
 
05:04:30.160 --> 05:04:31.510 align:start position:0%
fled
and

05:04:31.510 --> 05:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:04:36.948 --> 05:04:36.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:39.510 --> 05:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
oh good i did ice hockey play by play at
 
05:04:39.520 --> 05:04:42.550 align:start position:0%
oh good i did ice hockey play by play at
college

05:04:42.550 --> 05:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:43.750 --> 05:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
high members of the committee abby
 
05:04:45.270 --> 05:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
rogers legislative liaison for the
 
05:04:47.110 --> 05:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
division of public health services i'm
 
05:04:48.310 --> 05:04:48.320 align:start position:0%
just going to take a second to review
 
05:04:49.830 --> 05:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
the bill i believe that john williams is
 
05:04:51.190 --> 05:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
reaching out to joe christie who's the
 
05:04:53.030 --> 05:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
cfo of new hampshire hospital to get his
 
05:04:55.430 --> 05:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
take on we didn't scare him off he'll be
 
05:04:55.440 --> 05:05:01.270 align:start position:0%
take on we didn't scare him off he'll be
back

05:05:01.270 --> 05:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:04.070 --> 05:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
so to answer
 
05:05:07.590 --> 05:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
representative knurk's question um if
 
05:05:09.830 --> 05:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
this prohibits the state of new
 
05:05:13.590 --> 05:05:13.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire or its political subdivisions
 
05:05:16.550 --> 05:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
re from requiring any business to check
 
05:05:16.560 --> 05:05:17.670 align:start position:0%
re from requiring any business to check
or

05:05:17.670 --> 05:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:05:19.510 --> 05:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
to require a check for the possession of
 
05:05:21.430 --> 05:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
any documentation for certified
 
05:05:25.750 --> 05:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
vaccinations or immunization status
 
05:05:28.070 --> 05:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
so the question really has to do with
 
05:05:30.230 --> 05:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
the hospitals that are in the nursing
 
05:05:31.990 --> 05:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
homes that fall under survey and
 
05:05:35.910 --> 05:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:40.830 --> 05:05:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:45.670 --> 05:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
and the requirement will be for them to
 
05:05:47.750 --> 05:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
ensure that the hospitals i'll just
 
05:05:49.030 --> 05:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
speak for the hospitals but i think
 
05:05:51.030 --> 05:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
nursing homes fall into this that the
 
05:05:52.868 --> 05:05:52.878 align:start position:0%
department while they certify they have
 
05:05:54.628 --> 05:05:54.638 align:start position:0%
to or go through the certification they
 
05:05:56.550 --> 05:05:56.560 align:start position:0%
have to make sure that they're following
 
05:05:58.788 --> 05:05:58.798 align:start position:0%
the cms policy so they will say show me
 
05:06:00.948 --> 05:06:00.958 align:start position:0%
your policy
 
05:06:04.788 --> 05:06:04.798 align:start position:0%
that requires you to ensure that
 
05:06:04.798 --> 05:06:05.670 align:start position:0%
that requires you to ensure that
they

05:06:05.670 --> 05:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:06:08.550 --> 05:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
are vaccinated or have been given the
 
05:06:10.390 --> 05:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity for an exemption
 
05:06:10.400 --> 05:06:13.590 align:start position:0%
opportunity for an exemption
etc

05:06:13.590 --> 05:06:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:15.990 --> 05:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
and i believe you're right i believe
 
05:06:18.788 --> 05:06:18.798 align:start position:0%
that any documentation will be how you
 
05:06:20.230 --> 05:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
verify that
 
05:06:23.510 --> 05:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
that they have in fact documented that
 
05:06:25.030 --> 05:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
they're either
 
05:06:27.830 --> 05:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
vaccinated or that they have um
 
05:06:30.390 --> 05:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
received an exemption so i think
 
05:06:32.390 --> 05:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
representative knurk
 
05:06:35.270 --> 05:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
is correct the way i read it that this
 
05:06:37.030 --> 05:06:37.040 align:start position:0%
could be in
 
05:06:39.590 --> 05:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
conflict with that requirement of this
 
05:06:39.600 --> 05:06:40.470 align:start position:0%
conflict with that requirement of this
state

05:06:40.470 --> 05:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:06:41.910 --> 05:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
that does the
 
05:06:43.830 --> 05:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
these certifications the cms
 
05:06:43.840 --> 05:06:45.430 align:start position:0%
these certifications the cms
certifications

05:06:45.430 --> 05:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
certifications
 
05:06:48.150 --> 05:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
representative leon respond thank you mr
 
05:06:48.160 --> 05:06:49.270 align:start position:0%
representative leon respond thank you mr
chairman

05:06:49.270 --> 05:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
05:06:51.670 --> 05:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
when i was looking at these with the
 
05:06:54.070 --> 05:06:54.080 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors this doesn't prohibit them
 
05:06:55.670 --> 05:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
from checking
 
05:06:57.270 --> 05:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
whether they're compliant with other
 
05:06:59.510 --> 05:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
requirements and other regulations it's
 
05:07:01.910 --> 05:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
simply not allowing the state to be the
 
05:07:04.470 --> 05:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
one telling them that they need to check
 
05:07:04.480 --> 05:07:05.510 align:start position:0%
one telling them that they need to check
for

05:07:05.510 --> 05:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:07:06.788 --> 05:07:06.798 align:start position:0%
for those vaccinations and
 
05:07:06.798 --> 05:07:08.708 align:start position:0%
for those vaccinations and
documentations

05:07:08.708 --> 05:07:08.718 align:start position:0%
documentations
 
05:07:10.470 --> 05:07:10.480 align:start position:0%
we don't believe that it interferes with
 
05:07:13.030 --> 05:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
their right to verify if they are in
 
05:07:17.190 --> 05:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
fact following other requirements
 
05:07:19.270 --> 05:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
representative canuck follow-up
 
05:07:21.270 --> 05:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
but it says explicitly
 
05:07:24.390 --> 05:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
that it shall not require
 
05:07:26.310 --> 05:07:26.320 align:start position:0%
any of them to check
 
05:07:28.868 --> 05:07:28.878 align:start position:0%
for the possession of any documentation
 
05:07:30.550 --> 05:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
and that's precisely what accreditation
 
05:07:32.550 --> 05:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
is all about is checking to be sure that
 
05:07:34.788 --> 05:07:34.798 align:start position:0%
they have done that that is the job
 
05:07:36.070 --> 05:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
that's why i brought that question up
 
05:07:37.830 --> 05:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
and i think it does create a conflict in
 
05:07:41.030 --> 05:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:43.910 --> 05:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative merchant
 
05:07:43.920 --> 05:07:44.948 align:start position:0%
representative merchant
i

05:07:44.948 --> 05:07:44.958 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:07:46.948 --> 05:07:46.958 align:start position:0%
i hear what you're saying represent
 
05:07:49.030 --> 05:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
i read it somewhat differently because
 
05:07:50.708 --> 05:07:50.718 align:start position:0%
the way i see this
 
05:07:54.070 --> 05:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
is they're not requiring
 
05:07:55.670 --> 05:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
the documentation based upon a state
 
05:07:57.270 --> 05:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
request or state requirement they're
 
05:07:58.708 --> 05:07:58.718 align:start position:0%
doing it based upon a federal
 
05:07:58.718 --> 05:07:59.750 align:start position:0%
doing it based upon a federal
requirement

05:07:59.750 --> 05:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
05:08:02.310 --> 05:08:02.320 align:start position:0%
so therefore when i read through this
 
05:08:04.470 --> 05:08:04.480 align:start position:0%
the political subdivisions shall not
 
05:08:06.310 --> 05:08:06.320 align:start position:0%
require any business or
 
05:08:08.708 --> 05:08:08.718 align:start position:0%
to inquire or check on the possessions
 
05:08:10.390 --> 05:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
of our documentation but that's at the
 
05:08:12.310 --> 05:08:12.320 align:start position:0%
state level versus trying to be sure
 
05:08:13.990 --> 05:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
that the complying with the federal
 
05:08:14.000 --> 05:08:15.190 align:start position:0%
that the complying with the federal
level

05:08:15.190 --> 05:08:15.200 align:start position:0%
level
 
05:08:17.190 --> 05:08:17.200 align:start position:0%
representative canarch but it is the
 
05:08:19.110 --> 05:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
state level at which accreditation is
 
05:08:20.868 --> 05:08:20.878 align:start position:0%
carried out and that is the problem
 
05:08:23.110 --> 05:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
because that is what they do they go in
 
05:08:24.230 --> 05:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
and they say
 
05:08:26.070 --> 05:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
show us your
 
05:08:26.080 --> 05:08:26.868 align:start position:0%
show us your
um

05:08:26.868 --> 05:08:26.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:29.510 --> 05:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
policies show us these things that is
 
05:08:31.590 --> 05:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
how we accredit you so they're not
 
05:08:33.270 --> 05:08:33.280 align:start position:0%
actually helping the federal government
 
05:08:35.030 --> 05:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
with compliance at all they're simply
 
05:08:38.150 --> 05:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
accrediting the institution and credit
 
05:08:40.150 --> 05:08:40.160 align:start position:0%
to accredit the institution
 
05:08:42.310 --> 05:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
they must check
 
05:08:44.150 --> 05:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
that documentation
 
05:08:46.070 --> 05:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
and that's and they're not checking it
 
05:08:47.270 --> 05:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
as a federal requirement they're
 
05:08:49.190 --> 05:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
checking it as a state requirement for
 
05:08:51.510 --> 05:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
licensing that is a state requirement
 
05:08:52.708 --> 05:08:52.718 align:start position:0%
and that's why that's happening that's
 
05:08:54.470 --> 05:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
why there's a conflict representative
 
05:08:54.480 --> 05:08:58.070 align:start position:0%
why there's a conflict representative
cushman

05:08:58.070 --> 05:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:00.470 --> 05:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman um i i'm in agreement
 
05:09:02.788 --> 05:09:02.798 align:start position:0%
with representative merchant uh the way
 
05:09:05.190 --> 05:09:05.200 align:start position:0%
that i read this is that it just can't
 
05:09:07.350 --> 05:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
be a dictate coming from the state this
 
05:09:11.830 --> 05:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
business needs to require or check
 
05:09:11.840 --> 05:09:13.670 align:start position:0%
business needs to require or check
status

05:09:13.670 --> 05:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
status
 
05:09:13.680 --> 05:09:14.470 align:start position:0%
status
of

05:09:14.470 --> 05:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:09:15.750 --> 05:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
of anyone
 
05:09:17.510 --> 05:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
and that the businesses if they want to
 
05:09:19.990 --> 05:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
comply with federal regulations
 
05:09:22.470 --> 05:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
and they're seeking certification
 
05:09:24.150 --> 05:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
they can do that
 
05:09:26.390 --> 05:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
but the state can't tell them
 
05:09:30.628 --> 05:09:30.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:32.470 --> 05:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
representative kenner you're on a roll
 
05:09:34.150 --> 05:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
this is my last what
 
05:09:36.550 --> 05:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
but i regardless what you think it means
 
05:09:38.788 --> 05:09:38.798 align:start position:0%
or the other sponsors think it means i
 
05:09:40.390 --> 05:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
think we really ought to listen to the
 
05:09:42.550 --> 05:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
people who actually are doing the
 
05:09:44.310 --> 05:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
accreditation and how they would
 
05:09:45.670 --> 05:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
interpret it and that's why i brought
 
05:09:47.110 --> 05:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
this question up
 
05:09:50.628 --> 05:09:50.638 align:start position:0%
um and so i think that we still have a
 
05:09:52.310 --> 05:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
i'm not i know you weren't trying to
 
05:09:54.788 --> 05:09:54.798 align:start position:0%
make a difficulty but i think it does
 
05:09:56.230 --> 05:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
that's my concern
 
05:09:58.390 --> 05:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
anything at this point that represents
 
05:10:00.230 --> 05:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh yeah sorry
 
05:10:03.270 --> 05:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
ms rogers uh ms linahan manhattan wish
 
05:10:05.590 --> 05:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
to say at this point sure i would say
 
05:10:07.590 --> 05:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
that uh i represent public health
 
05:10:09.750 --> 05:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
services so technically accreditation is
 
05:10:11.830 --> 05:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
not under my purview for the department
 
05:10:13.510 --> 05:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily but i can say i do agree
 
05:10:15.190 --> 05:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
with representative kenner that it does
 
05:10:17.270 --> 05:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
seem to propose
 
05:10:19.030 --> 05:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a conflict with that
 
05:10:21.430 --> 05:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
with the certification having to ask
 
05:10:22.948 --> 05:10:22.958 align:start position:0%
business or employees have said business
 
05:10:24.550 --> 05:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
especially if they're a healthcare
 
05:10:25.990 --> 05:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
business whether
 
05:10:28.470 --> 05:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
there is a vaccination status
 
05:10:30.390 --> 05:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
in place if that's required to do their
 
05:10:32.868 --> 05:10:32.878 align:start position:0%
business and required by licensure okay
 
05:10:35.110 --> 05:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
representative folsom
 
05:10:37.750 --> 05:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
05:10:40.150 --> 05:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in this that says a
 
05:10:40.160 --> 05:10:41.270 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in this that says a
business

05:10:41.270 --> 05:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
business
 
05:10:43.590 --> 05:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
can't require that
 
05:10:46.390 --> 05:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
it just says the state can't require it
 
05:10:48.628 --> 05:10:48.638 align:start position:0%
so if you're a hospital or a nursing
 
05:10:48.638 --> 05:10:49.750 align:start position:0%
so if you're a hospital or a nursing
home

05:10:49.750 --> 05:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
home
 
05:10:52.628 --> 05:10:52.638 align:start position:0%
and you know that cms would like you to
 
05:10:53.670 --> 05:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
do this
 
05:10:55.670 --> 05:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
if you want your money
 
05:10:57.990 --> 05:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
then they choose as the hospital yes
 
05:11:00.470 --> 05:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
we're gonna we are going to require that
 
05:11:03.030 --> 05:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
of our employees because
 
05:11:06.150 --> 05:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
that's what cms is requesting so it's
 
05:11:08.550 --> 05:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
not the state telling the hospital and
 
05:11:10.628 --> 05:11:10.638 align:start position:0%
nursing home you have to do that it's a
 
05:11:14.788 --> 05:11:14.798 align:start position:0%
decision made by the hospital to follow
 
05:11:17.030 --> 05:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
the cms guidelines
 
05:11:19.750 --> 05:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
except the state and that's probably not
 
05:11:21.670 --> 05:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
the right term but they are kind of
 
05:11:24.628 --> 05:11:24.638 align:start position:0%
agents of cms when it comes to survey
 
05:11:28.150 --> 05:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
and certification they contract with cms
 
05:11:31.030 --> 05:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
to survey the nursing homes and survey
 
05:11:32.948 --> 05:11:32.958 align:start position:0%
the critical access hospitals we're not
 
05:11:34.390 --> 05:11:34.400 align:start position:0%
talking about all our hospitals we're
 
05:11:35.590 --> 05:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
talking about the critical access
 
05:11:39.110 --> 05:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
hospitals because they use the um health
 
05:11:42.310 --> 05:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
facilities licensing cms certification
 
05:11:46.310 --> 05:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
it it is a cms certification so that is
 
05:11:48.270 --> 05:11:48.280 align:start position:0%
that's the same concern that i have with
 
05:11:51.670 --> 05:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
1455 that got passed as is um
 
05:11:51.680 --> 05:11:52.470 align:start position:0%
1455 that got passed as is um
um

05:11:52.470 --> 05:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:54.390 --> 05:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
the speaker's bill it
 
05:11:56.868 --> 05:11:56.878 align:start position:0%
that was our testimony in that bill and
 
05:11:59.350 --> 05:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
i think it's still flawed because it it
 
05:12:01.270 --> 05:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
is going to be a problem um there's
 
05:12:03.350 --> 05:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
going to be a conflict and i think the
 
05:12:06.948 --> 05:12:06.958 align:start position:0%
agency is going to be con have a trouble
 
05:12:10.070 --> 05:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
um unless it's clarified in here that
 
05:12:12.230 --> 05:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
nothing in this um chat in this
 
05:12:15.350 --> 05:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
paragraph um you know and i
 
05:12:16.470 --> 05:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
i probably could come up with some
 
05:12:18.948 --> 05:12:18.958 align:start position:0%
language but nothing in this paragraph
 
05:12:20.868 --> 05:12:20.878 align:start position:0%
would prohibit um
 
05:12:20.878 --> 05:12:21.830 align:start position:0%
would prohibit um
that

05:12:21.830 --> 05:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:12:23.910 --> 05:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
from occurring because again they i
 
05:12:25.590 --> 05:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
don't know if agent is the right term
 
05:12:28.390 --> 05:12:28.400 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at um representative weber
 
05:12:30.070 --> 05:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
maybe it is the right maybe that is the
 
05:12:33.430 --> 05:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
right term um but it's they are acting
 
05:12:36.708 --> 05:12:36.718 align:start position:0%
on behalf of cms they have a contract so
 
05:12:39.750 --> 05:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
that's why it it it causes a conflict it
 
05:12:42.628 --> 05:12:42.638 align:start position:0%
does i think it does representative
 
05:12:42.638 --> 05:12:45.910 align:start position:0%
does i think it does representative
weber

05:12:45.910 --> 05:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:47.910 --> 05:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
i haven't seen the documentation but it
 
05:12:49.830 --> 05:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
sounds to me like it's an agency
 
05:12:52.868 --> 05:12:52.878 align:start position:0%
relationship and
 
05:12:55.190 --> 05:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
i was when i when i first started
 
05:12:57.670 --> 05:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
thinking about this i was wondering if
 
05:12:59.590 --> 05:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
there was a way to
 
05:12:59.600 --> 05:13:00.788 align:start position:0%
there was a way to
say

05:13:00.788 --> 05:13:00.798 align:start position:0%
say
 
05:13:02.230 --> 05:13:02.240 align:start position:0%
well i was instantly thinking new
 
05:13:03.990 --> 05:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital in the county nursing
 
05:13:05.430 --> 05:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
homes and i
 
05:13:07.430 --> 05:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
thought well maybe if we just insert the
 
05:13:10.390 --> 05:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
word private business here
 
05:13:11.990 --> 05:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
that would take care of it but it
 
05:13:13.750 --> 05:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't because some of the hospitals
 
05:13:17.350 --> 05:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
are not state-run hospitals
 
05:13:17.360 --> 05:13:20.150 align:start position:0%
are not state-run hospitals
so

05:13:20.150 --> 05:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:21.830 --> 05:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
05:13:24.628 --> 05:13:24.638 align:start position:0%
whether you fix it by putting the
 
05:13:27.510 --> 05:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
disclaimer that you're talking about in
 
05:13:28.868 --> 05:13:28.878 align:start position:0%
so that
 
05:13:31.430 --> 05:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
those evaluations can continue to take
 
05:13:31.440 --> 05:13:32.868 align:start position:0%
those evaluations can continue to take
place

05:13:32.868 --> 05:13:32.878 align:start position:0%
place
 
05:13:36.190 --> 05:13:36.200 align:start position:0%
or whether you carve out
 
05:13:38.948 --> 05:13:38.958 align:start position:0%
hospitals nursing homes and medical
 
05:13:40.708 --> 05:13:40.718 align:start position:0%
facilities which probably doesn't
 
05:13:40.718 --> 05:13:41.910 align:start position:0%
facilities which probably doesn't
fulfill

05:13:41.910 --> 05:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
fulfill
 
05:13:43.910 --> 05:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
the intent of the people who proposed it
 
05:13:45.430 --> 05:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
i mean i
 
05:13:47.670 --> 05:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to figure out a way
 
05:13:47.680 --> 05:13:48.708 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to figure out a way
of

05:13:48.708 --> 05:13:48.718 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:13:51.430 --> 05:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
having it apply to all those businesses
 
05:13:53.270 --> 05:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
i mean i love the idea that the business
 
05:13:55.430 --> 05:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
is given the right to decide what
 
05:13:57.350 --> 05:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
they're going to collect and people can
 
05:13:58.788 --> 05:13:58.798 align:start position:0%
work there people can work somewhere
 
05:14:01.110 --> 05:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
else and that's that's all good
 
05:14:03.590 --> 05:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
or people can attend or not attend
 
05:14:03.600 --> 05:14:05.030 align:start position:0%
or people can attend or not attend
um

05:14:05.030 --> 05:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:07.110 --> 05:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
i was
 
05:14:11.350 --> 05:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:13.030 --> 05:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
and now i've sort of lost the thought
 
05:14:13.040 --> 05:14:13.750 align:start position:0%
and now i've sort of lost the thought
but

05:14:13.750 --> 05:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:14:17.510 --> 05:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
i i was thinking of a carve out
 
05:14:19.590 --> 05:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
but i'm increasing
 
05:14:21.750 --> 05:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
the thing i'm wondering about is are
 
05:14:24.070 --> 05:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
there other businesses
 
05:14:27.030 --> 05:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
that might be in the same
 
05:14:27.040 --> 05:14:28.150 align:start position:0%
that might be in the same
state

05:14:28.150 --> 05:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:14:29.830 --> 05:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
that might might need the same kind of
 
05:14:31.830 --> 05:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
carve outs and i can't think what they
 
05:14:33.110 --> 05:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
are because
 
05:14:34.310 --> 05:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
i'm here on the health and human
 
05:14:36.550 --> 05:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
services committee and and the hospitals
 
05:14:37.990 --> 05:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
and the nursing homes are what come to
 
05:14:39.830 --> 05:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
my mind
 
05:14:42.310 --> 05:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
so contractors
 
05:14:46.550 --> 05:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
federal contractors possibly um
 
05:14:48.470 --> 05:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
yeah i feel like we're at a disadvantage
 
05:14:49.990 --> 05:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
because we're just seeing this amendment
 
05:14:52.868 --> 05:14:52.878 align:start position:0%
right now um and i i i need to think
 
05:14:54.708 --> 05:14:54.718 align:start position:0%
this through a little bit more of the
 
05:14:56.788 --> 05:14:56.798 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences representative
 
05:14:59.030 --> 05:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
webber continue um
 
05:15:00.390 --> 05:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
i think
 
05:15:02.628 --> 05:15:02.638 align:start position:0%
i think i i was kind of persuaded by
 
05:15:04.948 --> 05:15:04.958 align:start position:0%
representative leon that if the
 
05:15:07.510 --> 05:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
if the mandate comes solely from the
 
05:15:09.510 --> 05:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
federal government straight down onto
 
05:15:11.830 --> 05:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
whoever it's falling on
 
05:15:13.590 --> 05:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
that that comes from the federal
 
05:15:15.350 --> 05:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
government and this doesn't
 
05:15:19.990 --> 05:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
cover it i think the time we get into
 
05:15:20.000 --> 05:15:21.190 align:start position:0%
cover it i think the time we get into
squishy

05:15:21.190 --> 05:15:21.200 align:start position:0%
squishy
 
05:15:21.200 --> 05:15:22.948 align:start position:0%
squishy
territory

05:15:22.948 --> 05:15:22.958 align:start position:0%
territory
 
05:15:22.958 --> 05:15:23.830 align:start position:0%
territory
is

05:15:23.830 --> 05:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:15:27.270 --> 05:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
this specific instance where
 
05:15:29.830 --> 05:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
because of the contract with the federal
 
05:15:32.550 --> 05:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
government the state is the enforcer
 
05:15:32.560 --> 05:15:33.910 align:start position:0%
government the state is the enforcer
of

05:15:33.910 --> 05:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:15:35.670 --> 05:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
requirements that come from the federal
 
05:15:38.390 --> 05:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
government so i think the state is in in
 
05:15:40.150 --> 05:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
many ways mandating it even though it
 
05:15:41.670 --> 05:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
was originally the federal government
 
05:15:43.030 --> 05:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
that did it so
 
05:15:45.110 --> 05:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
whether it's a carve out or or whether
 
05:15:47.350 --> 05:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
it's clarifying language i think i would
 
05:15:48.708 --> 05:15:48.718 align:start position:0%
be a lot more comp
 
05:15:50.550 --> 05:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
a lot more comfortable if we went that
 
05:15:52.948 --> 05:15:52.958 align:start position:0%
direction mr williams do you have news
 
05:15:59.350 --> 05:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:00.788 --> 05:16:00.798 align:start position:0%
chairman pearson members committee
 
05:16:03.590 --> 05:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
regrettably um i usually come through
 
05:16:05.510 --> 05:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
but i could not get a hold of either mr
 
05:16:07.350 --> 05:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
joe christie that testified before this
 
05:16:08.788 --> 05:16:08.798 align:start position:0%
committee on the underlying bill from
 
05:16:11.510 --> 05:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital or nathan white
 
05:16:13.350 --> 05:16:13.360 align:start position:0%

who is our director for our procurement
unit

05:16:14.390 --> 05:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
unit
 
05:16:16.390 --> 05:16:16.400 align:start position:0%
i can try to get information to this
 
05:16:18.390 --> 05:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
committee on whether or not there are
 
05:16:20.550 --> 05:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
any issues to the bill we do appreciate
 
05:16:21.830 --> 05:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
the work that was done by the committee
 
05:16:24.470 --> 05:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
i think to try to address the concerns
 
05:16:26.150 --> 05:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
i just can't independently without
 
05:16:27.910 --> 05:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
confirming with either one of those two
 
05:16:29.750 --> 05:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
gentlemen that this doesn't present any
 
05:16:31.750 --> 05:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
problems for the department um i did
 
05:16:33.750 --> 05:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
earnestly get try to get a hold of them
 
05:16:35.990 --> 05:16:36.000 align:start position:0%

you know where he lives i do okay that's
 
05:16:44.390 --> 05:16:44.400 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
05:16:53.030 --> 05:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
how about where it says it's um in line
 
05:16:56.150 --> 05:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
14 where it says accept as specified in
 
05:16:56.160 --> 05:16:57.910 align:start position:0%
14 where it says accept as specified in
rsa141c

05:16:57.910 --> 05:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
rsa141c
 
05:17:00.628 --> 05:17:00.638 align:start position:0%
i didn't look up 141c but
 
05:17:02.708 --> 05:17:02.718 align:start position:0%
because it's already giving an exception
 
05:17:05.030 --> 05:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
how about except we're required by
 
05:17:11.990 --> 05:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:13.990 --> 05:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
you are addressing that to whom
 
05:17:14.000 --> 05:17:16.868 align:start position:0%
you are addressing that to whom
everybody

05:17:16.868 --> 05:17:16.878 align:start position:0%

anybody representative cushman thank you
 
05:17:22.230 --> 05:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
mr chairman uh just a couple of points
 
05:17:23.830 --> 05:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
so we've i've heard i've gotten
 
05:17:26.310 --> 05:17:26.320 align:start position:0%
testimony from the president of the
 
05:17:29.030 --> 05:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
american association of certifying
 
05:17:31.670 --> 05:17:31.680 align:start position:0%
agencies that are is a
 
05:17:33.910 --> 05:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh basically like a union a professional
 
05:17:36.948 --> 05:17:36.958 align:start position:0%
organization that represents all of the
 
05:17:39.590 --> 05:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
medicare medicaid cms certifying
 
05:17:42.150 --> 05:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
agencies across the country and in the
 
05:17:44.150 --> 05:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
states where they are
 
05:17:46.868 --> 05:17:46.878 align:start position:0%
they have bills similar to 1455 that we
 
05:17:50.628 --> 05:17:50.638 align:start position:0%
just passed in 1604 where they will not
 
05:17:52.788 --> 05:17:52.798 align:start position:0%
be certifying based on certain
 
05:17:55.270 --> 05:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
requirements such as the vaccine mandate
 
05:17:57.350 --> 05:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
that they've just continued to certify
 
05:17:57.360 --> 05:17:58.150 align:start position:0%
that they've just continued to certify
and

05:17:58.150 --> 05:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:17:58.160 --> 05:17:59.190 align:start position:0%
and
it's

05:17:59.190 --> 05:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:18:00.628 --> 05:18:00.638 align:start position:0%
you know there have been no negative
 
05:18:03.350 --> 05:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
consequences from that i also don't see
 
05:18:04.868 --> 05:18:04.878 align:start position:0%
why our state
 
05:18:07.190 --> 05:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
agencies couldn't just say
 
05:18:09.190 --> 05:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
the state isn't legally allowed to
 
05:18:11.110 --> 05:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
require this but if you want to meet the
 
05:18:14.070 --> 05:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
federal requirement you need to provide
 
05:18:16.830 --> 05:18:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:20.070 --> 05:18:20.080 align:start position:0%

05:18:52.470 --> 05:18:52.480 align:start position:0%
let's um we'll consider it overnight and
 
05:18:54.070 --> 05:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
either bring this back up or bring
 
05:18:55.910 --> 05:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
another amendment tomorrow so what
 
05:18:58.550 --> 05:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting is we should now move
 
05:19:00.628 --> 05:19:00.638 align:start position:0%
towards recessing this and not come to a
 
05:19:03.190 --> 05:19:03.200 align:start position:0%
decision representative
 
05:19:04.550 --> 05:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
just one last comment while we're
 
05:19:06.948 --> 05:19:06.958 align:start position:0%
thinking about this question though
 
05:19:08.550 --> 05:19:08.560 align:start position:0%
i think it's important to remember that
 
05:19:10.868 --> 05:19:10.878 align:start position:0%
we've had a lot of bills that came in
 
05:19:13.350 --> 05:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
based upon covet 19
 
05:19:16.390 --> 05:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
but the changes they make are sweeping
 
05:19:16.400 --> 05:19:17.190 align:start position:0%
but the changes they make are sweeping
and

05:19:17.190 --> 05:19:17.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:19:18.550 --> 05:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
for the future
 
05:19:20.310 --> 05:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
one of the big problems is ever trying
 
05:19:22.628 --> 05:19:22.638 align:start position:0%
to legislate
 
05:19:24.230 --> 05:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
public health responses because they
 
05:19:25.910 --> 05:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
need to be nimble and fast and
 
05:19:27.910 --> 05:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
legislative processes intentionally
 
05:19:29.510 --> 05:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
rather slow
 
05:19:30.948 --> 05:19:30.958 align:start position:0%
to remember this doesn't say anything
 
05:19:32.868 --> 05:19:32.878 align:start position:0%
about covert 19 this would be anything
 
05:19:34.788 --> 05:19:34.798 align:start position:0%
so if we got some other kind of
 
05:19:36.788 --> 05:19:36.798 align:start position:0%
incredibly horrendous
 
05:19:38.788 --> 05:19:38.798 align:start position:0%
pandemic of some sort respiratory as the
 
05:19:40.070 --> 05:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
usual type of
 
05:19:42.868 --> 05:19:42.878 align:start position:0%
thing we have to think of um
 
05:19:44.788 --> 05:19:44.798 align:start position:0%
this would not allow our public health
 
05:19:46.628 --> 05:19:46.638 align:start position:0%
agencies to
 
05:19:48.310 --> 05:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
have the flexibility that they might
 
05:19:50.310 --> 05:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
want not that they would if we think
 
05:19:51.270 --> 05:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
about it
 
05:19:53.590 --> 05:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
in this which was a you know the biggest
 
05:19:57.350 --> 05:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
one for our lifetimes in a century
 
05:20:00.310 --> 05:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
the state was not mandating
 
05:20:01.670 --> 05:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
the businesses
 
05:20:03.670 --> 05:20:03.680 align:start position:0%
through vaccinations i very much doubt
 
05:20:05.190 --> 05:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
they ever would but i'm not sure we
 
05:20:06.708 --> 05:20:06.718 align:start position:0%
should be prohibiting and tying the
 
05:20:09.750 --> 05:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
hands of our public health people
 
05:20:11.350 --> 05:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
for a
 
05:20:13.110 --> 05:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
highly unlikely situation but if a
 
05:20:14.948 --> 05:20:14.958 align:start position:0%
highly unlikely situation comes we don't
 
05:20:17.350 --> 05:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
want them to say sorry we can't do
 
05:20:19.270 --> 05:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
anything about this so i was still
 
05:20:21.510 --> 05:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
leaning toward just simply
 
05:20:23.190 --> 05:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
itl on the bill
 
05:20:24.628 --> 05:20:24.638 align:start position:0%
rather than trying to parse this to
 
05:20:26.948 --> 05:20:26.958 align:start position:0%
become a little less troubling because i
 
05:20:31.030 --> 05:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
don't think we actually need it anyway
 
05:20:33.270 --> 05:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
representative leon thank you mr
 
05:20:36.310 --> 05:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
chairman while i appreciate that
 
05:20:37.590 --> 05:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
there's a question of what's around the
 
05:20:37.600 --> 05:20:38.708 align:start position:0%
there's a question of what's around the
corner

05:20:38.708 --> 05:20:38.718 align:start position:0%
corner
 
05:20:40.788 --> 05:20:40.798 align:start position:0%
back before i was a representative i
 
05:20:42.948 --> 05:20:42.958 align:start position:0%
came and testified at one of the
 
05:20:45.590 --> 05:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
emergency powers hearings in that one
 
05:20:47.190 --> 05:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
they were talking about any excess
 
05:20:49.430 --> 05:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
supplies the way it was written
 
05:20:51.270 --> 05:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
food beyond that day your child's
 
05:20:52.948 --> 05:20:52.958 align:start position:0%
medication beyond that day could have
 
05:20:54.708 --> 05:20:54.718 align:start position:0%
been confiscated
 
05:20:56.310 --> 05:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
three bicycles with two people in the
 
05:20:58.230 --> 05:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
household that that third bicycle could
 
05:21:00.788 --> 05:21:00.798 align:start position:0%
be confiscated so it's our job to make
 
05:21:03.910 --> 05:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
sure that the response is in keeping
 
05:21:06.390 --> 05:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
with the demands and that we do have
 
05:21:08.628 --> 05:21:08.638 align:start position:0%
reasonable limits that that our agencies
 
05:21:09.910 --> 05:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
will work around
 
05:21:12.230 --> 05:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
i'm convinced that in an ebola pandemic
 
05:21:14.470 --> 05:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
or anything like that the businesses
 
05:21:16.548 --> 05:21:16.558 align:start position:0%
themselves would be requiring this out
 
05:21:18.948 --> 05:21:18.958 align:start position:0%
of protection and in something that is
 
05:21:22.150 --> 05:21:22.160 align:start position:0%
far more virulent than covid19 i don't
 
05:21:24.070 --> 05:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
think we need the state to act in order
 
05:21:26.230 --> 05:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
to get people to follow through but i
 
05:21:28.390 --> 05:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
just instead of moving forward on this
 
05:21:29.750 --> 05:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
let's recess it and try and get through
 
05:21:31.350 --> 05:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
a few more bills
 
05:21:33.110 --> 05:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:21:34.948 --> 05:21:34.958 align:start position:0%
all right the chair accepts that
 
05:21:37.708 --> 05:21:37.718 align:start position:0%
suggestion and we are going to recess on
 
05:21:41.190 --> 05:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
1495 but we will be looking at it
 
05:21:41.200 --> 05:21:46.948 align:start position:0%
1495 but we will be looking at it
tomorrow

05:21:46.948 --> 05:21:46.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:51.070 --> 05:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
i opened the executive session on
 
05:21:54.470 --> 05:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
1409 relative to the age at which a
 
05:21:56.390 --> 05:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
minor may receive mental health
 
05:21:57.910 --> 05:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
treatment without
 
05:22:01.030 --> 05:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
parental consent
 
05:22:03.350 --> 05:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
and you may remember yes
 
05:22:04.708 --> 05:22:04.718 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
05:22:06.948 --> 05:22:06.958 align:start position:0%
we have an amendment is that 513
 
05:22:06.958 --> 05:22:08.310 align:start position:0%
we have an amendment is that 513
amendment

05:22:08.310 --> 05:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:22:09.830 --> 05:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
but he also wants to make an
 
05:22:14.788 --> 05:22:14.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:16.470 --> 05:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
i can't hear you sir
 
05:22:19.110 --> 05:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
thank you this is not specifically about
 
05:22:21.670 --> 05:22:21.680 align:start position:0%
this bill but since we've had so many
 
05:22:23.430 --> 05:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
bills that involve
 
05:22:26.628 --> 05:22:26.638 align:start position:0%
um consent and confidentiality for
 
05:22:29.190 --> 05:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
adolescents in terms of
 
05:22:31.430 --> 05:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
vaccines and this one in terms of mental
 
05:22:33.590 --> 05:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
health center i came across
 
05:22:35.990 --> 05:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
an adolescent and young adult health
 
05:22:37.670 --> 05:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
care in new hampshire a guide to
 
05:22:39.230 --> 05:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
understanding consent and
 
05:22:42.708 --> 05:22:42.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:44.708 --> 05:22:44.718 align:start position:0%
done by a national organization so i've
 
05:22:46.708 --> 05:22:46.718 align:start position:0%
made copies that not enough copies for
 
05:22:49.030 --> 05:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
everybody but i'll leave the copies
 
05:22:51.350 --> 05:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
by representative folsom and if anybody
 
05:22:52.948 --> 05:22:52.958 align:start position:0%
wants one
 
05:22:57.510 --> 05:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:00.310 --> 05:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
coming around is representative weber's
 
05:23:03.350 --> 05:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
amendment zero five one three
 
05:23:05.030 --> 05:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
and when we've all had a chance to look
 
05:23:06.150 --> 05:23:06.160 align:start position:0%
at it
 
05:23:08.070 --> 05:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
we'll ask you to
 
05:23:10.310 --> 05:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
walk us through it
 
05:23:23.190 --> 05:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:25.830 --> 05:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
and on 1409
 
05:23:28.948 --> 05:23:28.958 align:start position:0%
people signed in in favor of the bill
 
05:23:30.868 --> 05:23:30.878 align:start position:0%
and 152
 
05:23:32.150 --> 05:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
signed in
 
05:23:46.230 --> 05:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:49.030 --> 05:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
do we have more 1409s
 
05:23:52.470 --> 05:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:56.868 --> 05:23:56.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:58.548 --> 05:23:58.558 align:start position:0%
did i get one
 
05:24:06.310 --> 05:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:09.590 --> 05:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
she'll make them she's gonna make a few
 
05:24:11.670 --> 05:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
boy i'm gonna miss having a photocopier
 
05:25:31.510 --> 05:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:33.510 --> 05:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
does everyone now have a copy of
 
05:25:36.788 --> 05:25:36.798 align:start position:0%
amendment 0513
 
05:25:43.350 --> 05:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:45.750 --> 05:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
and would representative
 
05:25:48.150 --> 05:25:48.160 align:start position:0%
um explain her amendment
 
05:25:50.390 --> 05:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you remember that
 
05:25:50.400 --> 05:25:52.628 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you remember that
when

05:25:52.628 --> 05:25:52.638 align:start position:0%
when
 
05:25:55.670 --> 05:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
house bill 1409 came to us it had long
 
05:25:58.548 --> 05:25:58.558 align:start position:0%
and complicated provisions on
 
05:26:01.350 --> 05:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
how um
 
05:26:03.270 --> 05:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
treatment was going to be paid for and
 
05:26:04.788 --> 05:26:04.798 align:start position:0%
whether what insurance was going to
 
05:26:07.750 --> 05:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
cover and there were terrible unresolved
 
05:26:09.670 --> 05:26:09.680 align:start position:0%
questions with how
 
05:26:12.390 --> 05:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
one maintained confidentiality with a
 
05:26:13.750 --> 05:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
minor when their
 
05:26:15.270 --> 05:26:15.280 align:start position:0%
parents were going to be
 
05:26:16.868 --> 05:26:16.878 align:start position:0%
presented with an explanation of
 
05:26:18.548 --> 05:26:18.558 align:start position:0%
benefits so
 
05:26:21.190 --> 05:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
this dodges frankly all of those
 
05:26:24.310 --> 05:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
questions by simply stating
 
05:26:27.030 --> 05:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
and as representative shapiro can speak
 
05:26:28.948 --> 05:26:28.958 align:start position:0%
more about
 
05:26:31.110 --> 05:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
the state of stuff as it is right now
 
05:26:33.670 --> 05:26:33.680 align:start position:0%
but but it's a little unclear so all
 
05:26:35.030 --> 05:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
this does
 
05:26:38.788 --> 05:26:38.798 align:start position:0%
is it says that a minor who is 16 or
 
05:26:38.798 --> 05:26:39.910 align:start position:0%
is it says that a minor who is 16 or
older

05:26:39.910 --> 05:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
older
 
05:26:42.310 --> 05:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
may voluntarily consent to mental health
 
05:26:42.320 --> 05:26:43.830 align:start position:0%
may voluntarily consent to mental health
services

05:26:43.830 --> 05:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
services
 
05:26:46.788 --> 05:26:46.798 align:start position:0%
so that's the minor may consent
 
05:26:48.708 --> 05:26:48.718 align:start position:0%
and a licensed mental health care
 
05:26:50.788 --> 05:26:50.798 align:start position:0%
provider may provide the services
 
05:26:52.548 --> 05:26:52.558 align:start position:0%
without the consent of the parent or
 
05:26:52.558 --> 05:26:53.590 align:start position:0%
without the consent of the parent or
guardian

05:26:53.590 --> 05:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
guardian
 
05:26:55.990 --> 05:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
provided that they're not going to
 
05:26:58.310 --> 05:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
provide medication
 
05:26:58.320 --> 05:27:00.628 align:start position:0%
provide medication
so

05:27:00.628 --> 05:27:00.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:00.638 --> 05:27:01.990 align:start position:0%
 
for

05:27:01.990 --> 05:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:27:05.910 --> 05:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
the kids who cannot go to their parents
 
05:27:07.350 --> 05:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
because their
 
05:27:10.230 --> 05:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
relationship with their parents
 
05:27:11.910 --> 05:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
is not such
 
05:27:13.350 --> 05:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
that their parents
 
05:27:15.510 --> 05:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
are already helping them look after
 
05:27:17.110 --> 05:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
their mental health
 
05:27:18.708 --> 05:27:18.718 align:start position:0%
which is of course what we want for
 
05:27:21.110 --> 05:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
every child
 
05:27:24.390 --> 05:27:24.400 align:start position:0%
it allows a kid who
 
05:27:26.390 --> 05:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
needs help
 
05:27:28.708 --> 05:27:28.718 align:start position:0%
is 16
 
05:27:31.670 --> 05:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
to go and get that help
 
05:27:35.030 --> 05:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
and it balances the interests you know
 
05:27:36.830 --> 05:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
we heard a lot of
 
05:27:36.840 --> 05:27:38.470 align:start position:0%
we heard a lot of
concern

05:27:38.470 --> 05:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
concern
 
05:27:41.270 --> 05:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
when we had the hearing of you know my
 
05:27:43.830 --> 05:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
kid may be taking a medication that i
 
05:27:46.708 --> 05:27:46.718 align:start position:0%
know nothing about and
 
05:27:49.350 --> 05:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
heard that concern so we limited it
 
05:27:52.948 --> 05:27:52.958 align:start position:0%
strictly speaking to
 
05:27:56.070 --> 05:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
talk therapy so it clarifies that the
 
05:27:58.470 --> 05:27:58.480 align:start position:0%
kid may and that the practitioner man
 
05:28:00.948 --> 05:28:00.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't go any further than that so
 
05:28:03.350 --> 05:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
with that i would be glad to offer
 
05:28:03.360 --> 05:28:05.350 align:start position:0%
with that i would be glad to offer
amendment

05:28:05.350 --> 05:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:28:05.360 --> 05:28:08.310 align:start position:0%
amendment
0513

05:28:08.310 --> 05:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
0513
 
05:28:09.910 --> 05:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
and the committee can do with it as they
 
05:28:09.920 --> 05:28:10.868 align:start position:0%
and the committee can do with it as they
please

05:28:10.868 --> 05:28:10.878 align:start position:0%
please
 
05:28:12.788 --> 05:28:12.798 align:start position:0%
representative folsom
 
05:28:14.628 --> 05:28:14.638 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
05:28:16.708 --> 05:28:16.718 align:start position:0%
just a question of some wording that
 
05:28:18.230 --> 05:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
kind of throws it in two different
 
05:28:22.070 --> 05:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
directions you just spoke of a person
 
05:28:25.670 --> 05:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
a minor 16 or older could seek out help
 
05:28:28.230 --> 05:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
but the way it's written here
 
05:28:30.548 --> 05:28:30.558 align:start position:0%
is they're not seeking it
 
05:28:32.788 --> 05:28:32.798 align:start position:0%
they're consenting to somebody else who
 
05:28:36.948 --> 05:28:36.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:39.910 --> 05:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
consent is a legal term of art which is
 
05:28:43.110 --> 05:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
used generally speaking for
 
05:28:43.120 --> 05:28:44.708 align:start position:0%
used generally speaking for
uh

05:28:44.708 --> 05:28:44.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:28:48.390 --> 05:28:48.400 align:start position:0%
who may agree to services either
 
05:28:49.830 --> 05:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
you know if i go to the hospital i have
 
05:28:52.310 --> 05:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
to consent for them
 
05:28:53.670 --> 05:28:53.680 align:start position:0%
to treat me
 
05:28:56.390 --> 05:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
if a kid goes to the hospital generally
 
05:28:58.150 --> 05:28:58.160 align:start position:0%
speaking the parent or guardian consents
 
05:29:00.548 --> 05:29:00.558 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the kid so this is not
 
05:29:02.470 --> 05:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
implying that somebody's coming up to
 
05:29:04.070 --> 05:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
somebody and going hey kid you want to
 
05:29:05.750 --> 05:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
have some mental health counseling in
 
05:29:08.230 --> 05:29:08.240 align:start position:0%
the back alley this is actually the
 
05:29:09.750 --> 05:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
legal term
 
05:29:12.150 --> 05:29:12.160 align:start position:0%
that we usually speak of
 
05:29:12.160 --> 05:29:14.070 align:start position:0%
that we usually speak of
for

05:29:14.070 --> 05:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:29:14.080 --> 05:29:15.510 align:start position:0%
for
somebody

05:29:15.510 --> 05:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
05:29:15.520 --> 05:29:16.788 align:start position:0%
somebody
approaching

05:29:16.788 --> 05:29:16.798 align:start position:0%
approaching
 
05:29:19.110 --> 05:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
a mental health counselor and you you
 
05:29:21.830 --> 05:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
you either agree that yes it's a good
 
05:29:23.670 --> 05:29:23.680 align:start position:0%
thing for 16 year olds to be able to do
 
05:29:25.430 --> 05:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
this or you don't and i know that there
 
05:29:28.310 --> 05:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
are many varied opinions on that but
 
05:29:28.320 --> 05:29:29.590 align:start position:0%
are many varied opinions on that but
um

05:29:29.590 --> 05:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:32.150 --> 05:29:32.160 align:start position:0%
i think the drafting probably should be
 
05:29:32.160 --> 05:29:36.868 align:start position:0%
i think the drafting probably should be
okay

05:29:36.868 --> 05:29:36.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:38.390 --> 05:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
i spoke with the
 
05:29:41.190 --> 05:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of the bill
 
05:29:43.430 --> 05:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
and it is her assertion
 
05:29:45.510 --> 05:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
that she eventually
 
05:29:45.520 --> 05:29:46.948 align:start position:0%
that she eventually
incrementally

05:29:46.948 --> 05:29:46.958 align:start position:0%
incrementally
 
05:29:49.830 --> 05:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
would like to move the age to 12.
 
05:29:52.390 --> 05:29:52.400 align:start position:0%
in fact a bill that she previously filed
 
05:29:54.788 --> 05:29:54.798 align:start position:0%
i believe had that age in it
 
05:29:57.750 --> 05:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
and i would also say that
 
05:30:00.070 --> 05:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
there are many steps
 
05:30:01.590 --> 05:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
that were not mentioned
 
05:30:01.600 --> 05:30:03.110 align:start position:0%
that were not mentioned
between

05:30:03.110 --> 05:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
between
 
05:30:06.150 --> 05:30:06.160 align:start position:0%
going to one's parent or not
 
05:30:09.750 --> 05:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
and going to a mental health counselor
 
05:30:11.750 --> 05:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
so many kids who just want to talk out
 
05:30:11.760 --> 05:30:13.030 align:start position:0%
so many kids who just want to talk out
something

05:30:13.030 --> 05:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
something
 
05:30:14.948 --> 05:30:14.958 align:start position:0%
go to a member of the clergy
 
05:30:17.190 --> 05:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
a coach a teacher
 
05:30:18.390 --> 05:30:18.400 align:start position:0%
a friend
 
05:30:20.310 --> 05:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
a whole variety of people who may not be
 
05:30:22.470 --> 05:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
licensed mental health counselors but
 
05:30:24.788 --> 05:30:24.798 align:start position:0%
people who need to talk things out can
 
05:30:26.628 --> 05:30:26.638 align:start position:0%
go to them
 
05:30:28.628 --> 05:30:28.638 align:start position:0%
however i think when we get to the level
 
05:30:30.788 --> 05:30:30.798 align:start position:0%
of the mental health counselor the
 
05:30:30.798 --> 05:30:32.470 align:start position:0%
of the mental health counselor the
professional

05:30:32.470 --> 05:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
professional
 
05:30:36.230 --> 05:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:37.420 --> 05:30:37.430 align:start position:0%
people who then
 
05:30:37.430 --> 05:30:38.948 align:start position:0%
people who then
[Music]

05:30:38.948 --> 05:30:38.958 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:30:44.708 --> 05:30:44.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:46.150 --> 05:30:46.160 align:start position:0%
i would think don't just have a little
 
05:30:47.590 --> 05:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
thing they want to talk through they got
 
05:30:49.430 --> 05:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
a big problem
 
05:30:51.270 --> 05:30:51.280 align:start position:0%
and i have to look at that big problem
 
05:30:52.948 --> 05:30:52.958 align:start position:0%
in that why they cannot talk with their
 
05:30:54.868 --> 05:30:54.878 align:start position:0%
parents may speak of something that is
 
05:30:57.030 --> 05:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
systemic within that family that may
 
05:30:58.948 --> 05:30:58.958 align:start position:0%
warrant further intervention
 
05:31:01.190 --> 05:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
what this does is short-circuit it
 
05:31:01.200 --> 05:31:01.910 align:start position:0%
what this does is short-circuit it
it

05:31:01.910 --> 05:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:31:04.708 --> 05:31:04.718 align:start position:0%
keeps secrets until they're exposed and
 
05:31:06.948 --> 05:31:06.958 align:start position:0%
then oh my gosh secrets have been told
 
05:31:08.708 --> 05:31:08.718 align:start position:0%
to others
 
05:31:08.718 --> 05:31:09.510 align:start position:0%
to others
i

05:31:09.510 --> 05:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:31:12.150 --> 05:31:12.160 align:start position:0%
see this as the erosion not the helping
 
05:31:15.270 --> 05:31:15.280 align:start position:0%
of the family system being fully well
 
05:31:19.670 --> 05:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:22.948 --> 05:31:22.958 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
05:31:26.708 --> 05:31:26.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:29.030 --> 05:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i i do think the
 
05:31:30.470 --> 05:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
other issue is
 
05:31:33.030 --> 05:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
a kid whether it's 12 or 16 i hope it
 
05:31:35.110 --> 05:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't go back to 12 because that to me
 
05:31:36.628 --> 05:31:36.638 align:start position:0%
is a big problem
 
05:31:39.110 --> 05:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
but if it is 16 16 year olds are
 
05:31:41.350 --> 05:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
ordinarily under the family's
 
05:31:43.430 --> 05:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
health insurance policy
 
05:31:44.948 --> 05:31:44.958 align:start position:0%
if they're going to go to a professional
 
05:31:46.708 --> 05:31:46.718 align:start position:0%
counselor they're going to have to
 
05:31:46.718 --> 05:31:48.150 align:start position:0%
counselor they're going to have to
request

05:31:48.150 --> 05:31:48.160 align:start position:0%
request
 
05:31:49.510 --> 05:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
that they're going to have to give the
 
05:31:51.110 --> 05:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
information about their insurance and
 
05:31:52.868 --> 05:31:52.878 align:start position:0%
the parents will be getting
 
05:31:52.878 --> 05:31:54.548 align:start position:0%
the parents will be getting
the

05:31:54.548 --> 05:31:54.558 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:31:57.270 --> 05:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
information that it's being paid and i
 
05:31:59.750 --> 05:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
don't know if medicaid some of them are
 
05:32:01.750 --> 05:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
going to be covered through the medicaid
 
05:32:01.760 --> 05:32:03.190 align:start position:0%
going to be covered through the medicaid
system

05:32:03.190 --> 05:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
system
 
05:32:05.750 --> 05:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming that the youngster can do
 
05:32:08.788 --> 05:32:08.798 align:start position:0%
it but whether or not that requires the
 
05:32:08.798 --> 05:32:10.150 align:start position:0%
it but whether or not that requires the
parents

05:32:10.150 --> 05:32:10.160 align:start position:0%
parents
 
05:32:12.150 --> 05:32:12.160 align:start position:0%
to request that it come under their
 
05:32:14.470 --> 05:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
medicaid coverage i think remains to be
 
05:32:14.480 --> 05:32:15.270 align:start position:0%
medicaid coverage i think remains to be
seen

05:32:15.270 --> 05:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
seen
 
05:32:18.150 --> 05:32:18.160 align:start position:0%
but it is it is kind of a complicated
 
05:32:19.670 --> 05:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
issue within it
 
05:32:21.910 --> 05:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
i do remember talking with the
 
05:32:24.230 --> 05:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
representative who sponsored this bill
 
05:32:25.830 --> 05:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
and raised questions about whether this
 
05:32:27.990 --> 05:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
can be any way tied in
 
05:32:30.230 --> 05:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
to the emancipation of minor bills which
 
05:32:32.548 --> 05:32:32.558 align:start position:0%
are in that's a court proceeding where
 
05:32:32.558 --> 05:32:33.990 align:start position:0%
are in that's a court proceeding where
essentially

05:32:33.990 --> 05:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
05:32:36.390 --> 05:32:36.400 align:start position:0%
the child essentially divorces his
 
05:32:38.310 --> 05:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
parents and can make adult decisions on
 
05:32:39.430 --> 05:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
his own
 
05:32:41.350 --> 05:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
but again it leaves open the problem of
 
05:32:43.990 --> 05:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
how does he cover the cost of this
 
05:32:47.510 --> 05:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
policy and so far none of that's been
 
05:32:49.510 --> 05:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
i think the assumption is you can go i
 
05:32:51.430 --> 05:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
could agree to see him but i have to
 
05:32:53.590 --> 05:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
understand i might not be getting paid
 
05:32:55.830 --> 05:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
for what i'm going to be doing
 
05:32:55.840 --> 05:32:58.230 align:start position:0%
for what i'm going to be doing
exactly

05:32:58.230 --> 05:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
05:33:01.110 --> 05:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
05:33:03.990 --> 05:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
yes i think this bill is very limited in
 
05:33:06.868 --> 05:33:06.878 align:start position:0%
scope purposely um because those other
 
05:33:09.590 --> 05:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
issues like payment are so complicated
 
05:33:11.830 --> 05:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
um i would say that
 
05:33:14.628 --> 05:33:14.638 align:start position:0%
as in most of the bills that we have
 
05:33:16.868 --> 05:33:16.878 align:start position:0%
we have competing benefits and
 
05:33:19.030 --> 05:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
consequences on both sides
 
05:33:19.040 --> 05:33:20.948 align:start position:0%
consequences on both sides
and

05:33:20.948 --> 05:33:20.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:33:22.948 --> 05:33:22.958 align:start position:0%
while i don't tend to use the term
 
05:33:25.030 --> 05:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
parental rights
 
05:33:26.628 --> 05:33:26.638 align:start position:0%
because i think
 
05:33:28.470 --> 05:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
parental rights
 
05:33:30.868 --> 05:33:30.878 align:start position:0%
are also parental responsibilities and
 
05:33:32.548 --> 05:33:32.558 align:start position:0%
um it's not like
 
05:33:34.628 --> 05:33:34.638 align:start position:0%
parental rights to me implies like
 
05:33:36.868 --> 05:33:36.878 align:start position:0%
ownership of our kids a little bit and
 
05:33:39.110 --> 05:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
um i don't think that's what people mean
 
05:33:41.910 --> 05:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
when they use the term but i do agree
 
05:33:43.030 --> 05:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
with um
 
05:33:45.430 --> 05:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
mr chairman with your
 
05:33:48.390 --> 05:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
thoughts about wanting to this is the
 
05:33:51.590 --> 05:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
kids family and as much as we can
 
05:33:53.990 --> 05:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
help the family work out problems this
 
05:33:55.350 --> 05:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
is for the best
 
05:33:58.230 --> 05:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
however i think on the other hand
 
05:34:00.628 --> 05:34:00.638 align:start position:0%
the competing benefits and consequences
 
05:34:02.708 --> 05:34:02.718 align:start position:0%
are that
 
05:34:05.030 --> 05:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
there are some
 
05:34:08.708 --> 05:34:08.718 align:start position:0%
young adults adolescents who do not have
 
05:34:12.470 --> 05:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
parents who for various reasons are
 
05:34:14.628 --> 05:34:14.638 align:start position:0%
able to provide the proper guidance and
 
05:34:17.030 --> 05:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
support and help
 
05:34:18.548 --> 05:34:18.558 align:start position:0%
and this would
 
05:34:20.548 --> 05:34:20.558 align:start position:0%
this would allow those
 
05:34:20.558 --> 05:34:22.230 align:start position:0%
this would allow those
kids

05:34:22.230 --> 05:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
kids
 
05:34:26.548 --> 05:34:26.558 align:start position:0%
those six 16 and 17 year olds
 
05:34:28.548 --> 05:34:28.558 align:start position:0%
um not easily
 
05:34:30.708 --> 05:34:30.718 align:start position:0%
because this bill doesn't make it easy
 
05:34:33.590 --> 05:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
but potentially to
 
05:34:38.628 --> 05:34:38.638 align:start position:0%
access mental health care and i i have a
 
05:34:40.868 --> 05:34:40.878 align:start position:0%
i have a list that was handed out during
 
05:34:43.030 --> 05:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
testimony i would say that half the
 
05:34:43.040 --> 05:34:44.150 align:start position:0%
testimony i would say that half the
states

05:34:44.150 --> 05:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
states
 
05:34:46.788 --> 05:34:46.798 align:start position:0%
about 25 out of the 50 states in the
 
05:34:48.310 --> 05:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
united states
 
05:34:48.320 --> 05:34:49.350 align:start position:0%
united states
um

05:34:49.350 --> 05:34:49.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:50.868 --> 05:34:50.878 align:start position:0%
allow for
 
05:34:53.510 --> 05:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
adolescents to access
 
05:34:55.670 --> 05:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
mental health care without
 
05:34:57.750 --> 05:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
their parents consent some as young as
 
05:35:01.190 --> 05:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
12 but many are 16 some are 14. it's all
 
05:35:03.190 --> 05:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
over the place but this is not an
 
05:35:03.200 --> 05:35:04.470 align:start position:0%
over the place but this is not an
uncommon

05:35:04.470 --> 05:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
uncommon
 
05:35:04.480 --> 05:35:06.788 align:start position:0%
uncommon
phenomenon

05:35:06.788 --> 05:35:06.798 align:start position:0%
phenomenon
 
05:35:09.830 --> 05:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
i would just ask the representative um
 
05:35:11.830 --> 05:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
i've done some a fair bit of counseling
 
05:35:13.590 --> 05:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
in my capacity you've done it as a
 
05:35:15.910 --> 05:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
professional licensed counselor do you
 
05:35:18.230 --> 05:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
see that most kids are bereft
 
05:35:19.510 --> 05:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
of having
 
05:35:21.190 --> 05:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
a coach a teacher
 
05:35:22.708 --> 05:35:22.718 align:start position:0%
the guy at the drop or gal at the
 
05:35:24.390 --> 05:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
drop-in center
 
05:35:24.400 --> 05:35:25.670 align:start position:0%
drop-in center
that

05:35:25.670 --> 05:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:35:27.670 --> 05:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
people can go to if the parents are not
 
05:35:31.590 --> 05:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:34.310 --> 05:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
well what i would say is that
 
05:35:37.430 --> 05:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:40.948 --> 05:35:40.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:42.788 --> 05:35:42.798 align:start position:0%
how kids do
 
05:35:45.430 --> 05:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
is whether they have a they often use
 
05:35:47.430 --> 05:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
the term charismatic but
 
05:35:49.190 --> 05:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
you know a caring
 
05:35:51.190 --> 05:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
and concerned
 
05:35:52.948 --> 05:35:52.958 align:start position:0%
and someone who's willing an adult
 
05:35:54.708 --> 05:35:54.718 align:start position:0%
that's willing to come forward even if
 
05:35:57.830 --> 05:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
they they don't have the family supports
 
05:35:59.670 --> 05:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
that having an adult
 
05:36:02.470 --> 05:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
who is um
 
05:36:04.628 --> 05:36:04.638 align:start position:0%
available to them really available to
 
05:36:04.638 --> 05:36:05.670 align:start position:0%
available to them really available to
them

05:36:05.670 --> 05:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:36:08.310 --> 05:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
is one of the main factors in how kids
 
05:36:10.548 --> 05:36:10.558 align:start position:0%
do as they come into adulthood and i
 
05:36:12.070 --> 05:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
think this just
 
05:36:14.628 --> 05:36:14.638 align:start position:0%
you know some adolescents have those
 
05:36:16.868 --> 05:36:16.878 align:start position:0%
other people they have a coach they have
 
05:36:20.070 --> 05:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
a somebody at the boys and girls club
 
05:36:22.390 --> 05:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
however it's kids from families who are
 
05:36:24.390 --> 05:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
having a lot of problems
 
05:36:25.830 --> 05:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
who tend to
 
05:36:28.948 --> 05:36:28.958 align:start position:0%
participate less in those activities
 
05:36:31.590 --> 05:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
church um religion
 
05:36:34.868 --> 05:36:34.878 align:start position:0%
um so i think i'd i would not
 
05:36:37.510 --> 05:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
i would not say that those other adults
 
05:36:37.520 --> 05:36:38.868 align:start position:0%
i would not say that those other adults
are

05:36:38.868 --> 05:36:38.878 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:36:40.708 --> 05:36:40.718 align:start position:0%
unimportant i would just say that this
 
05:36:42.310 --> 05:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
adds another
 
05:36:45.590 --> 05:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
um resource for
 
05:36:48.868 --> 05:36:48.878 align:start position:0%
16 and 17 year old adults to get help
 
05:36:50.628 --> 05:36:50.638 align:start position:0%
when they're hurting representative
 
05:36:50.638 --> 05:36:51.670 align:start position:0%
when they're hurting representative
knurk

05:36:51.670 --> 05:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
knurk
 
05:36:53.190 --> 05:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh yes and i would agree i think that's
 
05:36:55.030 --> 05:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
the issue is that it'd be a rather small
 
05:36:57.430 --> 05:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
number of kids who would actually
 
05:36:58.708 --> 05:36:58.718 align:start position:0%
do this
 
05:37:01.190 --> 05:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
it would be that rare child who does not
 
05:37:03.030 --> 05:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
have anybody that they can turn to and
 
05:37:04.548 --> 05:37:04.558 align:start position:0%
it's also important to realize that some
 
05:37:05.510 --> 05:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
of the
 
05:37:07.110 --> 05:37:07.120 align:start position:0%
a coach may be great to teach you how to
 
05:37:09.110 --> 05:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
handle a soccer ball but they may not be
 
05:37:11.430 --> 05:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
the best person to talk to if you are
 
05:37:11.440 --> 05:37:12.390 align:start position:0%
the best person to talk to if you are
being

05:37:12.390 --> 05:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
being
 
05:37:15.270 --> 05:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
sexually abused by your
 
05:37:15.280 --> 05:37:16.470 align:start position:0%
sexually abused by your
stepbrother

05:37:16.470 --> 05:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
stepbrother
 
05:37:18.150 --> 05:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
that just may not be an optimal person
 
05:37:20.470 --> 05:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
to go to to have that conversation
 
05:37:22.788 --> 05:37:22.798 align:start position:0%
now the thing is that
 
05:37:24.390 --> 05:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
the issue yes we cut out all the
 
05:37:26.230 --> 05:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
reimbursement that can be a problem but
 
05:37:28.150 --> 05:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
charity care has been provided by
 
05:37:28.160 --> 05:37:29.750 align:start position:0%
charity care has been provided by
providers

05:37:29.750 --> 05:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
providers
 
05:37:29.760 --> 05:37:30.708 align:start position:0%
providers
for

05:37:30.708 --> 05:37:30.718 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:37:32.150 --> 05:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
hundreds of years
 
05:37:34.390 --> 05:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
and i think if you had a provider who
 
05:37:36.390 --> 05:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
had a child come in that was really in
 
05:37:38.708 --> 05:37:38.718 align:start position:0%
trouble and sought care
 
05:37:41.270 --> 05:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
they probably i think a fair number of
 
05:37:43.590 --> 05:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
them would be willing to treat
 
05:37:45.670 --> 05:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
a small number of those kids for a short
 
05:37:48.788 --> 05:37:48.798 align:start position:0%
time if necessary and then try to engage
 
05:37:50.470 --> 05:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
the family i think just about every good
 
05:37:53.270 --> 05:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
provider would try to engage the family
 
05:37:53.280 --> 05:37:54.390 align:start position:0%
provider would try to engage the family
ultimately

05:37:54.390 --> 05:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
ultimately
 
05:37:55.910 --> 05:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
um and there's another point i was going
 
05:37:57.990 --> 05:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
to make but i forgot now what it was
 
05:37:59.910 --> 05:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro will buy you some
 
05:37:59.920 --> 05:38:01.510 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro will buy you some
time

05:38:01.510 --> 05:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:38:03.750 --> 05:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
i also want to point out that this is
 
05:38:06.230 --> 05:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
you know potentially an added resource
 
05:38:06.240 --> 05:38:07.430 align:start position:0%
you know potentially an added resource
for

05:38:07.430 --> 05:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:38:07.440 --> 05:38:08.708 align:start position:0%
for
teens

05:38:08.708 --> 05:38:08.718 align:start position:0%
teens
 
05:38:11.030 --> 05:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
and a protection for teens
 
05:38:12.948 --> 05:38:12.958 align:start position:0%
but it's also a protection for
 
05:38:15.430 --> 05:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
clinicians who want to provide this care
 
05:38:18.708 --> 05:38:18.718 align:start position:0%
i think the landscape now is incredibly
 
05:38:20.948 --> 05:38:20.958 align:start position:0%
unclear about what the age of consent
 
05:38:22.628 --> 05:38:22.638 align:start position:0%
actually is
 
05:38:22.638 --> 05:38:23.830 align:start position:0%
actually is
and

05:38:23.830 --> 05:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:38:27.910 --> 05:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
this would just make it clear that if
 
05:38:30.868 --> 05:38:30.878 align:start position:0%
if those mental health clinicians
 
05:38:31.990 --> 05:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
chose to
 
05:38:34.230 --> 05:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
that they would have some protection in
 
05:38:35.430 --> 05:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
working with
 
05:38:37.350 --> 05:38:37.360 align:start position:0%
an older adolescent
 
05:38:39.590 --> 05:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
representative snow
 
05:38:40.788 --> 05:38:40.798 align:start position:0%
yes i
 
05:38:41.750 --> 05:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
want to
 
05:38:43.750 --> 05:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
remind people i believe most of you may
 
05:38:45.190 --> 05:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
have been present whether or not it was
 
05:38:47.190 --> 05:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
this year or during the last session
 
05:38:48.708 --> 05:38:48.718 align:start position:0%
that we had some very meaningful
 
05:38:50.948 --> 05:38:50.958 align:start position:0%
testimony by a young woman who at the
 
05:38:53.030 --> 05:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
time was a student at unh
 
05:38:54.868 --> 05:38:54.878 align:start position:0%
but during her last two years of high
 
05:38:57.270 --> 05:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
school she was very depressed
 
05:38:59.910 --> 05:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
considered suicide from time to time
 
05:39:01.750 --> 05:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
and her parents because of being
 
05:39:01.760 --> 05:39:03.030 align:start position:0%
and her parents because of being
embarrassed

05:39:03.030 --> 05:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
embarrassed
 
05:39:05.190 --> 05:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
by having a child with
 
05:39:07.750 --> 05:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
mental problems refused to allow her to
 
05:39:09.110 --> 05:39:09.120 align:start position:0%
have any contact with a mental health
 
05:39:11.670 --> 05:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
professional until she got to unh where
 
05:39:13.670 --> 05:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
she did have access to the gun do you
 
05:39:16.868 --> 05:39:16.878 align:start position:0%
remember hearing that testimony and
 
05:39:19.190 --> 05:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
i think when it gets to the point
 
05:39:21.270 --> 05:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
that woman sounded like she was the kind
 
05:39:23.270 --> 05:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
of trouble that a coach or a friend is
 
05:39:24.548 --> 05:39:24.558 align:start position:0%
really not going to be a great deal of
 
05:39:25.750 --> 05:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
help for
 
05:39:27.510 --> 05:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
and certainly i worked in the business
 
05:39:29.270 --> 05:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
for a long time i think if a child that
 
05:39:31.590 --> 05:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
young i take the risk of trying to see
 
05:39:33.430 --> 05:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
them and i think most people would but i
 
05:39:36.070 --> 05:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
agree with him that this bill if it
 
05:39:37.270 --> 05:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
passes would
 
05:39:39.430 --> 05:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
tend to clarify that a little bit but i
 
05:39:41.830 --> 05:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
think most people if they thought
 
05:39:43.430 --> 05:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
they were going to be able to prevent a
 
05:39:44.708 --> 05:39:44.718 align:start position:0%
suicide now
 
05:39:46.230 --> 05:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
one of the things that often happens
 
05:39:48.310 --> 05:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
when you see them is you usually want to
 
05:39:51.510 --> 05:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
start them on some sort of medication
 
05:39:54.230 --> 05:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
and at that point i do agree with her
 
05:39:54.240 --> 05:39:55.270 align:start position:0%
and at that point i do agree with her
that

05:39:55.270 --> 05:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:39:57.030 --> 05:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
we would have to involve the family at
 
05:39:58.548 --> 05:39:58.558 align:start position:0%
that point i think that would be
 
05:40:01.110 --> 05:40:01.120 align:start position:0%
irresponsible but leading up to that
 
05:40:04.070 --> 05:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:06.868 --> 05:40:06.878 align:start position:0%
if you at least make that first gesture
 
05:40:08.548 --> 05:40:08.558 align:start position:0%
of sitting down and seeing them
 
05:40:11.190 --> 05:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
understanding the problem making sure
 
05:40:13.510 --> 05:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
that they know that you as the counselor
 
05:40:16.788 --> 05:40:16.798 align:start position:0%
are on their side and want to help
 
05:40:19.350 --> 05:40:19.360 align:start position:0%
that they may be able to listen to you
 
05:40:21.750 --> 05:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
about taking other steps that might
 
05:40:24.708 --> 05:40:24.718 align:start position:0%
improve that degree of health
 
05:40:26.390 --> 05:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
so i don't know if i'm making any sense
 
05:40:28.070 --> 05:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
but i do think this is a very serious
 
05:40:29.110 --> 05:40:29.120 align:start position:0%
issue and it
 
05:40:31.110 --> 05:40:31.120 align:start position:0%
we do have to think about
 
05:40:33.510 --> 05:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
kids i'm still opposed to lowering the
 
05:40:35.590 --> 05:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
age much below 16 but i would be
 
05:40:37.670 --> 05:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
comfortable with this
 
05:40:39.510 --> 05:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
under those circumstances
 
05:40:39.520 --> 05:40:40.628 align:start position:0%
under those circumstances
and

05:40:40.628 --> 05:40:40.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:40:42.948 --> 05:40:42.958 align:start position:0%
i think we have to use common sense some
 
05:40:44.628 --> 05:40:44.638 align:start position:0%
things are just very serious and we got
 
05:40:46.708 --> 05:40:46.718 align:start position:0%
to take them seriously representative
 
05:40:48.628 --> 05:40:48.638 align:start position:0%
kanark have you rediscovered your second
 
05:40:48.638 --> 05:40:49.510 align:start position:0%
kanark have you rediscovered your second
point

05:40:49.510 --> 05:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
point
 
05:40:51.430 --> 05:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
i figured out why it left my head it
 
05:40:52.948 --> 05:40:52.958 align:start position:0%
went sucking right down to
 
05:40:54.070 --> 05:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
representative snow because that was
 
05:40:55.430 --> 05:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
precisely what i was going to do is
 
05:40:57.110 --> 05:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
harken back to that desperate woman who
 
05:40:59.110 --> 05:40:59.120 align:start position:0%
was unable to get help when she was
 
05:41:00.788 --> 05:41:00.798 align:start position:0%
under 18. thank you for doing that
 
05:41:02.548 --> 05:41:02.558 align:start position:0%
representative snow
 
05:41:07.190 --> 05:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:08.948 --> 05:41:08.958 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:41:11.910 --> 05:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
this also allows i think
 
05:41:14.548 --> 05:41:14.558 align:start position:0%
for a school psychologist
 
05:41:14.558 --> 05:41:15.670 align:start position:0%
for a school psychologist
to

05:41:15.670 --> 05:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:41:17.350 --> 05:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
speak to a minor
 
05:41:20.150 --> 05:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
who probably needs some therapy
 
05:41:21.670 --> 05:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason
 
05:41:24.230 --> 05:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
and i think again back to the same thing
 
05:41:26.708 --> 05:41:26.718 align:start position:0%
we're not trying to destroy the family
 
05:41:28.868 --> 05:41:28.878 align:start position:0%
we're actually trying to repair it
 
05:41:31.830 --> 05:41:31.840 align:start position:0%
the pair the students here i i can share
 
05:41:33.030 --> 05:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
with you
 
05:41:35.270 --> 05:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
from my wife was a school nurse
 
05:41:36.628 --> 05:41:36.638 align:start position:0%
there are many
 
05:41:39.910 --> 05:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
times in which a child needs help
 
05:41:43.270 --> 05:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
but the parent is the barrier to it so
 
05:41:45.270 --> 05:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
i don't think this bill is trying to
 
05:41:47.190 --> 05:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
destroy the family unit i really think
 
05:41:49.430 --> 05:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
it's trying to repair the family unit as
 
05:41:51.990 --> 05:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
that has been destroyed in allowing
 
05:41:53.350 --> 05:41:53.360 align:start position:0%
health care professionals the
 
05:41:53.360 --> 05:41:55.270 align:start position:0%
health care professionals the
opportunity

05:41:55.270 --> 05:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
05:41:57.670 --> 05:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
to talk to a child at that age
 
05:42:00.230 --> 05:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
to try to help them understand that the
 
05:42:01.830 --> 05:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
parents really aren't that bad they're
 
05:42:03.990 --> 05:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
just trying to look at life differently
 
05:42:06.150 --> 05:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
and try to find a way to bridge the gap
 
05:42:07.670 --> 05:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
between the minor and the parent is
 
05:42:11.750 --> 05:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:13.750 --> 05:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
05:42:16.310 --> 05:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:42:18.230 --> 05:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
i have to um
 
05:42:21.270 --> 05:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that you know there are
 
05:42:24.788 --> 05:42:24.798 align:start position:0%
some cases where parents do not
 
05:42:27.590 --> 05:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
provide what is needed for a child
 
05:42:29.510 --> 05:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
but again we
 
05:42:32.628 --> 05:42:32.638 align:start position:0%
circle back to the issue of
 
05:42:34.948 --> 05:42:34.958 align:start position:0%
taking away the rights of some
 
05:42:37.270 --> 05:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
because of a few bad actors
 
05:42:37.280 --> 05:42:38.470 align:start position:0%
because of a few bad actors
and

05:42:38.470 --> 05:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:42:40.948 --> 05:42:40.958 align:start position:0%
i have concerns about a minor
 
05:42:42.470 --> 05:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
16 years
 
05:42:44.230 --> 05:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
17 years old
 
05:42:47.510 --> 05:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
being alone in a room with someone
 
05:42:49.830 --> 05:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
without their parents knowledge
 
05:42:52.548 --> 05:42:52.558 align:start position:0%
i think it puts them in and that person
 
05:42:54.390 --> 05:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
in a dangerous situation when the
 
05:42:58.230 --> 05:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:01.030 --> 05:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
05:43:03.270 --> 05:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
thank you i discussed this with my
 
05:43:03.280 --> 05:43:04.230 align:start position:0%
thank you i discussed this with my
daughter

05:43:04.230 --> 05:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
daughter
 
05:43:06.070 --> 05:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
who is the
 
05:43:08.390 --> 05:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
parent of two
 
05:43:10.230 --> 05:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
older teens
 
05:43:13.590 --> 05:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
and she immediately said but mom
 
05:43:15.190 --> 05:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
there's too many kids who don't have
 
05:43:17.670 --> 05:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
responsible parents
 
05:43:19.110 --> 05:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
and so
 
05:43:21.110 --> 05:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
you know i i feel
 
05:43:24.150 --> 05:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
torn in both these directions
 
05:43:26.390 --> 05:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
but i don't think i would have had to
 
05:43:26.400 --> 05:43:27.350 align:start position:0%
but i don't think i would have had to
fear

05:43:27.350 --> 05:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
fear
 
05:43:30.470 --> 05:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
if my child went to the counselor and i
 
05:43:32.788 --> 05:43:32.798 align:start position:0%
know in my in salem
 
05:43:35.110 --> 05:43:35.120 align:start position:0%
i'm told that it's
 
05:43:38.390 --> 05:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
the kids the counselors have the right
 
05:43:40.150 --> 05:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
the fact that the child's in school they
 
05:43:42.230 --> 05:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
have the right to see the counselor
 
05:43:45.270 --> 05:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
there they don't need a written pass
 
05:43:46.948 --> 05:43:46.958 align:start position:0%
from the parents
 
05:43:48.548 --> 05:43:48.558 align:start position:0%
but i also know
 
05:43:50.708 --> 05:43:50.718 align:start position:0%
that the counselors
 
05:43:52.708 --> 05:43:52.718 align:start position:0%
are way overworked
 
05:43:55.190 --> 05:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
and have way too many kids
 
05:43:58.150 --> 05:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
and if you listen to judge broderick a
 
05:44:00.628 --> 05:44:00.638 align:start position:0%
lot of kids come to him every time he
 
05:44:02.948 --> 05:44:02.958 align:start position:0%
goes and speaks at a school
 
05:44:02.958 --> 05:44:04.230 align:start position:0%
goes and speaks at a school
wherever

05:44:04.230 --> 05:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
wherever
 
05:44:07.190 --> 05:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
tons of kids come and tell him that they
 
05:44:08.788 --> 05:44:08.798 align:start position:0%
are so troubled
 
05:44:08.798 --> 05:44:10.788 align:start position:0%
are so troubled
so

05:44:10.788 --> 05:44:10.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:44:13.350 --> 05:44:13.360 align:start position:0%
i'm going to fall off the fence on that
 
05:44:16.470 --> 05:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
on the side that i would rather
 
05:44:18.868 --> 05:44:18.878 align:start position:0%
that they see a counselor
 
05:44:20.230 --> 05:44:20.240 align:start position:0%
and you certainly hope that the
 
05:44:21.990 --> 05:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
counselor is responsible and does
 
05:44:23.430 --> 05:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
everything they can
 
05:44:25.830 --> 05:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
to do the family repair
 
05:44:33.830 --> 05:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:37.110 --> 05:44:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:39.270 --> 05:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
may i make a motion the chair is going
 
05:44:40.470 --> 05:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
to make a motion
 
05:44:42.070 --> 05:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
okay the chair makes the motion
 
05:44:46.390 --> 05:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:51.430 --> 05:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:53.430 --> 05:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
may i make an inquiry of the chair you
 
05:44:53.440 --> 05:44:54.708 align:start position:0%
may i make an inquiry of the chair you
may

05:44:54.708 --> 05:44:54.718 align:start position:0%
may
 
05:44:56.948 --> 05:44:56.958 align:start position:0%
so the motion is inexpedient to
 
05:45:00.230 --> 05:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
legislate so if i want to pass the bill
 
05:45:02.548 --> 05:45:02.558 align:start position:0%
with the amendment i need to vote
 
05:45:05.510 --> 05:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
against the itl and then bring a motion
 
05:45:07.430 --> 05:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
on the amendment is this correct thank
 
05:45:11.270 --> 05:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:13.590 --> 05:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
05:45:15.590 --> 05:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
yes before we vote i would just like to
 
05:45:16.470 --> 05:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
say that
 
05:45:17.590 --> 05:45:17.600 align:start position:0%
i know
 
05:45:19.590 --> 05:45:19.600 align:start position:0%
that some people are going to view this
 
05:45:19.600 --> 05:45:21.430 align:start position:0%
that some people are going to view this
as

05:45:21.430 --> 05:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
as
 
05:45:23.990 --> 05:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
taking away something from parents
 
05:45:26.230 --> 05:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
and i would um
 
05:45:29.190 --> 05:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
i would just ask people to understand
 
05:45:29.200 --> 05:45:30.150 align:start position:0%
i would just ask people to understand
that

05:45:30.150 --> 05:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:45:32.948 --> 05:45:32.958 align:start position:0%
people who have an engaged
 
05:45:32.958 --> 05:45:35.030 align:start position:0%
people who have an engaged
positive

05:45:35.030 --> 05:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
positive
 
05:45:37.910 --> 05:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
maybe not 100 positive but an engaged
 
05:45:40.548 --> 05:45:40.558 align:start position:0%
relationship with their adolescent
 
05:45:40.558 --> 05:45:41.590 align:start position:0%
relationship with their adolescent
children

05:45:41.590 --> 05:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
children
 
05:45:41.600 --> 05:45:43.750 align:start position:0%
children
um

05:45:43.750 --> 05:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:45.350 --> 05:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
there's going to be discussion with
 
05:45:47.590 --> 05:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
their adolescent children before they go
 
05:45:50.070 --> 05:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
to therapy it's this is not gonna this
 
05:45:53.350 --> 05:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
is not gonna create a um wave of people
 
05:45:56.230 --> 05:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
running away from their parents to um
 
05:45:56.240 --> 05:45:57.510 align:start position:0%
running away from their parents to um
secretively

05:45:57.510 --> 05:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
secretively
 
05:46:00.230 --> 05:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
secure therapy people who have
 
05:46:00.240 --> 05:46:02.830 align:start position:0%
secure therapy people who have
um

05:46:02.830 --> 05:46:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:05.510 --> 05:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
positive healthy relationships with
 
05:46:05.520 --> 05:46:06.310 align:start position:0%
positive healthy relationships with
their

05:46:06.310 --> 05:46:06.320 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:46:09.190 --> 05:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
kids this will be discussed and probably
 
05:46:11.350 --> 05:46:11.360 align:start position:0%
the parents will go with them to therapy
 
05:46:12.868 --> 05:46:12.878 align:start position:0%
the first time and introduce them to the
 
05:46:14.628 --> 05:46:14.638 align:start position:0%
therapist or there'll be a family
 
05:46:16.310 --> 05:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
systems and
 
05:46:17.990 --> 05:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps there'll be a family systems
 
05:46:19.830 --> 05:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
person who works with the whole family
 
05:46:23.110 --> 05:46:23.120 align:start position:0%
which is a very good thing um so
 
05:46:25.830 --> 05:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
i hope people will not view this as only
 
05:46:28.150 --> 05:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
taking something away or taking rights
 
05:46:31.430 --> 05:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
away from parents but offering
 
05:46:31.440 --> 05:46:33.510 align:start position:0%
away from parents but offering
um

05:46:33.510 --> 05:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:36.868 --> 05:46:36.878 align:start position:0%
a resource for some kids for whom this
 
05:46:39.190 --> 05:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
might be a lifesaver thank you
 
05:46:41.350 --> 05:46:41.360 align:start position:0%
representative kanark
 
05:46:43.670 --> 05:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
mine's more a parliamentary inquiry on
 
05:46:45.510 --> 05:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
most of the bills today
 
05:46:47.510 --> 05:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
if an amendment was offered we took up
 
05:46:49.750 --> 05:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
that amendment first and voted before we
 
05:46:51.190 --> 05:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
then voted on the bill and here we're
 
05:46:53.270 --> 05:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
going straight to itl i know we could do
 
05:46:54.390 --> 05:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
that but
 
05:46:57.510 --> 05:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
would we would it be kind to go ahead
 
05:46:59.190 --> 05:46:59.200 align:start position:0%
and consider the amendment first and
 
05:47:04.310 --> 05:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:06.708 --> 05:47:06.718 align:start position:0%
i have been overruled by
 
05:47:08.150 --> 05:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
my ranking member
 
05:47:11.030 --> 05:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:14.868 --> 05:47:14.878 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak
 
05:47:16.868 --> 05:47:16.878 align:start position:0%
once again i would reiterate the fact
 
05:47:19.750 --> 05:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot of steps between
 
05:47:22.230 --> 05:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
talking with one's parents
 
05:47:24.868 --> 05:47:24.878 align:start position:0%
and needing to engage a professional
 
05:47:26.628 --> 05:47:26.638 align:start position:0%
licensed credentialed mental health
 
05:47:26.638 --> 05:47:28.548 align:start position:0%
licensed credentialed mental health
expert

05:47:28.548 --> 05:47:28.558 align:start position:0%
expert
 
05:47:31.030 --> 05:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
many people do have a coach and some
 
05:47:33.430 --> 05:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
coaches coach soccer and not kids
 
05:47:36.070 --> 05:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
but there are other coaches or teachers
 
05:47:39.190 --> 05:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
or clergy or boys and girls club people
 
05:47:41.430 --> 05:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
and if it gets to the place where
 
05:47:43.430 --> 05:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
they're just not
 
05:47:45.270 --> 05:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
able to do it because the problem is so
 
05:47:45.280 --> 05:47:47.030 align:start position:0%
able to do it because the problem is so
great

05:47:47.030 --> 05:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
great
 
05:47:49.670 --> 05:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
then we do have a great situation in
 
05:47:50.948 --> 05:47:50.958 align:start position:0%
that family
 
05:47:53.030 --> 05:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
and to keep the parents out of that loop
 
05:47:56.948 --> 05:47:56.958 align:start position:0%
at that point may well make it worse
 
05:47:56.958 --> 05:47:58.230 align:start position:0%
at that point may well make it worse
so

05:47:58.230 --> 05:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:48:02.230 --> 05:48:02.240 align:start position:0%
i do not see this as being of help
 
05:48:04.948 --> 05:48:04.958 align:start position:0%
a parliamentary inquiry you may
 
05:48:07.830 --> 05:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
so if somebody wants to ultimately
 
05:48:09.590 --> 05:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
vote for the amendment
 
05:48:11.670 --> 05:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
right now because the itl motion is
 
05:48:14.628 --> 05:48:14.638 align:start position:0%
before us we should vote down the itl so
 
05:48:15.910 --> 05:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
we can get to the amendment this is
 
05:48:18.390 --> 05:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
correct thank you
 
05:48:20.310 --> 05:48:20.320 align:start position:0%

05:48:22.548 --> 05:48:22.558 align:start position:0%

05:54:02.230 --> 05:54:02.240 align:start position:0%
it's not always about abused kids you
 
05:54:04.390 --> 05:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
know i know the really smart kids whose
 
05:54:06.470 --> 05:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
parents demand they become doctors and
 
05:54:07.830 --> 05:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
their poets
 
05:54:09.910 --> 05:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
you know 16 trying to fight out what
 
05:54:12.310 --> 05:54:12.320 align:start position:0%
college to go to and whatever i mean
 
05:54:14.070 --> 05:54:14.080 align:start position:0%
there's lots of reasons kids go to
 
05:54:14.080 --> 05:54:15.910 align:start position:0%
there's lots of reasons kids go to
therapy

05:54:15.910 --> 05:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
therapy
 
05:54:17.990 --> 05:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
well i still think that kid
 
05:54:20.230 --> 05:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
i remember how impressed i was with her
 
05:54:22.788 --> 05:54:22.798 align:start position:0%
did she testify oh yeah yeah yeah i mean
 
05:54:24.708 --> 05:54:24.718 align:start position:0%
she was so desperate my parents never
 
05:54:24.718 --> 05:54:25.830 align:start position:0%
she was so desperate my parents never
went

05:54:25.830 --> 05:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
went
 
05:54:27.590 --> 05:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
it was a snobby thing it wasn't even
 
05:54:27.600 --> 05:54:28.470 align:start position:0%
it was a snobby thing it wasn't even
anything

05:54:28.470 --> 05:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
anything
 
05:54:33.510 --> 05:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:34.788 --> 05:54:34.798 align:start position:0%
well of course i wouldn't know where to
 
05:54:36.948 --> 05:54:36.958 align:start position:0%
find a therapist but my parents wouldn't
 
05:54:38.470 --> 05:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
let me it's not going to happen all that
 
05:54:39.830 --> 05:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
often and i don't think we would have
 
05:54:41.270 --> 05:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
gotten to that and i think one of the
 
05:54:43.670 --> 05:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
things that hurts us is just one
 
05:54:49.990 --> 05:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:51.510 --> 05:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
well i hope she doesn't run again i
 
05:54:51.520 --> 05:55:08.868 align:start position:0%
well i hope she doesn't run again i
think

05:55:08.868 --> 05:55:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:11.030 --> 05:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
young black man that testified and
 
05:55:13.510 --> 05:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
whatever you know she's just
 
05:55:14.948 --> 05:55:14.958 align:start position:0%
and then she made
 
05:55:16.548 --> 05:55:16.558 align:start position:0%
something on facebook you probably
 
05:55:18.708 --> 05:55:18.718 align:start position:0%
learned on facebook she goes how about
 
05:55:21.190 --> 05:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
christians give up hating jews for less
 
05:55:22.150 --> 05:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
i'm like
 
05:55:28.390 --> 05:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:30.470 --> 05:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
i had the same experience she came to me
 
05:55:32.788 --> 05:55:32.798 align:start position:0%
way back when she had that first bill
 
05:55:33.910 --> 05:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
with that
 
05:55:33.920 --> 05:55:35.030 align:start position:0%
with that
yeah

05:55:35.030 --> 05:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:55:37.190 --> 05:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
i didn't want to sound too negative all
 
05:55:39.350 --> 05:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
right so i said well
 
05:55:42.070 --> 05:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
you know let's think about this
 
05:55:44.548 --> 05:55:44.558 align:start position:0%
maybe if you made this bill a little
 
05:55:44.558 --> 05:55:45.830 align:start position:0%
maybe if you made this bill a little
more

05:55:45.830 --> 05:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:55:45.840 --> 05:55:48.788 align:start position:0%
more
comparable

05:55:48.788 --> 05:55:48.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:04.868 --> 05:56:04.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:04.878 --> 05:56:26.390 align:start position:0%
 
unfortunately

05:56:26.390 --> 05:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:27.990 --> 05:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
you know well you know i worked at a
 
05:56:29.750 --> 05:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
mental health center we're mandated to
 
05:56:31.830 --> 05:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
see people oh yeah i wasn't i was trying
 
05:56:34.628 --> 05:56:34.638 align:start position:0%
to turn a profit which i didn't but
 
05:56:38.708 --> 05:56:38.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:40.070 --> 05:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
so like
 
05:56:42.548 --> 05:56:42.558 align:start position:0%
i had this one woman came in
 
05:56:44.150 --> 05:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
her brother or brother-in-law got
 
05:56:44.160 --> 05:56:45.990 align:start position:0%
her brother or brother-in-law got
deported

05:56:45.990 --> 05:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
deported
 
05:56:48.390 --> 05:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
the sister-in-law was in prison
 
05:56:51.030 --> 05:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
and or the other way around whatever
 
05:56:52.310 --> 05:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
yeah their sister-in-law was in france
 
05:56:54.628 --> 05:56:54.638 align:start position:0%
so she took in their child or two
 
05:56:56.548 --> 05:56:56.558 align:start position:0%
children and she had three of her own
 
05:56:58.230 --> 05:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
and she's working a full-time job at
 
05:56:58.240 --> 05:56:59.750 align:start position:0%
and she's working a full-time job at

06:12:20.948 --> 06:12:20.958 align:start position:0%
read 1487 and the chair calls on
 
06:12:23.750 --> 06:12:23.760 align:start position:0%

side by side with the bill
 
06:12:32.390 --> 06:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
06:12:35.430 --> 06:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
in regards to the
 
06:12:38.070 --> 06:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
language if you go back to the original
 
06:12:38.080 --> 06:12:40.310 align:start position:0%
language if you go back to the original
bill

06:12:40.310 --> 06:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:12:41.910 --> 06:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
under four
 
06:12:43.110 --> 06:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
this is unoriginal bill not the
 
06:12:44.868 --> 06:12:44.878 align:start position:0%
amendment under four
 
06:12:47.030 --> 06:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
the way it words is
 
06:12:48.548 --> 06:12:48.558 align:start position:0%
different than the amendment and that's
 
06:12:51.030 --> 06:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
going to be on the line where it says
 
06:12:52.868 --> 06:12:52.878 align:start position:0%
the general court finds a requirement
 
06:12:54.548 --> 06:12:54.558 align:start position:0%
for current and former health care
 
06:12:57.510 --> 06:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
provider to sign the form i change it to
 
06:12:57.520 --> 06:12:58.390 align:start position:0%
provider to sign the form i change it to
read

06:12:58.390 --> 06:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
read
 
06:12:58.400 --> 06:12:59.510 align:start position:0%
read
differently

06:12:59.510 --> 06:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
differently
 
06:13:01.990 --> 06:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
finds that limiting the requirement to a
 
06:13:04.070 --> 06:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
current and health care provider which
 
06:13:05.110 --> 06:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
is what we're talking about we're
 
06:13:08.230 --> 06:13:08.240 align:start position:0%
limiting the option for the patient on
 
06:13:10.628 --> 06:13:10.638 align:start position:0%
the bill itself
 
06:13:12.310 --> 06:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
you're looking at line 12.
 
06:13:14.070 --> 06:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
on on the amendment you're looking at
 
06:13:18.150 --> 06:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:20.070 --> 06:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
and where changes between the words
 
06:13:21.590 --> 06:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
finds that the
 
06:13:24.788 --> 06:13:24.798 align:start position:0%
requirement which is on line 12 of the
 
06:13:24.798 --> 06:13:25.750 align:start position:0%
requirement which is on line 12 of the
bill

06:13:25.750 --> 06:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:13:27.750 --> 06:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
was changed in line five the court finds
 
06:13:30.310 --> 06:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
that limiting the requirement
 
06:13:33.670 --> 06:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
so it inserted a word a single word why
 
06:13:33.680 --> 06:13:34.830 align:start position:0%
so it inserted a word a single word why
because

06:13:34.830 --> 06:13:34.840 align:start position:0%
because
 
06:13:34.840 --> 06:13:36.390 align:start position:0%
because
it's

06:13:36.390 --> 06:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
it's
 
06:13:38.310 --> 06:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
limiting the requirement if we're going
 
06:13:39.990 --> 06:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
to basically at that point in time allow
 
06:13:41.910 --> 06:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
for the options for the patient to opt
 
06:13:41.920 --> 06:13:42.788 align:start position:0%
for the options for the patient to opt
out

06:13:42.788 --> 06:13:42.798 align:start position:0%
out
 
06:13:44.470 --> 06:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
we need to change it to
 
06:13:46.628 --> 06:13:46.638 align:start position:0%
something that's more broad
 
06:13:48.628 --> 06:13:48.638 align:start position:0%
and saying limiting so it's
 
06:13:51.190 --> 06:13:51.200 align:start position:0%
what happened was the way the original
 
06:13:54.310 --> 06:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
bill was written the legislative intent
 
06:13:56.548 --> 06:13:56.558 align:start position:0%
was talking about the requirement
 
06:13:58.548 --> 06:13:58.558 align:start position:0%
for a current health care provider
 
06:14:02.708 --> 06:14:02.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:04.470 --> 06:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
okay it's it's a
 
06:14:06.230 --> 06:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
it's in my opinion it was more of a
 
06:14:08.548 --> 06:14:08.558 align:start position:0%
grammatical change
 
06:14:10.788 --> 06:14:10.798 align:start position:0%
the other part though was
 
06:14:10.798 --> 06:14:11.590 align:start position:0%
the other part though was
on

06:14:11.590 --> 06:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
on
 
06:14:11.600 --> 06:14:12.470 align:start position:0%
on
the

06:14:12.470 --> 06:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:14:14.150 --> 06:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
bill itself
 
06:14:16.230 --> 06:14:16.240 align:start position:0%
if you go to line 19
 
06:14:20.708 --> 06:14:20.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:24.230 --> 06:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
what it talks about is a healthcare
 
06:14:26.390 --> 06:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
provider either current or former and
 
06:14:28.470 --> 06:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
what came up during the conversation was
 
06:14:30.470 --> 06:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
not to limit that
 
06:14:32.948 --> 06:14:32.958 align:start position:0%
was to allow for the patient to sign the
 
06:14:35.750 --> 06:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
form without the
 
06:14:38.150 --> 06:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
signature of a current health care
 
06:14:40.868 --> 06:14:40.878 align:start position:0%
provider the challenge there is that if
 
06:14:43.750 --> 06:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
we only allow the patient to do it
 
06:14:45.190 --> 06:14:45.200 align:start position:0%
the department health and human services
 
06:14:47.350 --> 06:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
will not know if the signature was
 
06:14:48.868 --> 06:14:48.878 align:start position:0%
actually that of the patient which is
 
06:14:48.878 --> 06:14:49.910 align:start position:0%
actually that of the patient which is
fraud

06:14:49.910 --> 06:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
fraud
 
06:14:52.070 --> 06:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
versus that coming from the patient
 
06:14:52.080 --> 06:14:53.270 align:start position:0%
versus that coming from the patient
themselves

06:14:53.270 --> 06:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
06:14:55.750 --> 06:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
so what we talked about what i came up
 
06:14:57.830 --> 06:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
with was
 
06:15:00.470 --> 06:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
if you go back to the amendment on the
 
06:15:03.030 --> 06:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
beginning of line four end of line 14
 
06:15:05.270 --> 06:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
the form shall be signed by a current or
 
06:15:07.990 --> 06:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
former health care provider or the form
 
06:15:10.150 --> 06:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
shall be notarized by an official
 
06:15:11.990 --> 06:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
authorized by a government governmental
 
06:15:14.548 --> 06:15:14.558 align:start position:0%
authority to notarize the signature
 
06:15:16.150 --> 06:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
to prevent the issue of fraud because
 
06:15:17.190 --> 06:15:17.200 align:start position:0%
that was one of the things that was
 
06:15:19.910 --> 06:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
raised and discussed was how do i know
 
06:15:22.150 --> 06:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
that the signature on that form is in
 
06:15:23.910 --> 06:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
fact that of the patients that's why we
 
06:15:25.670 --> 06:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
wanted the provider to
 
06:15:27.350 --> 06:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
sign the form because if they're signing
 
06:15:29.430 --> 06:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
it they know the patient signed it so to
 
06:15:31.190 --> 06:15:31.200 align:start position:0%
avoid the issue of fraud by having a
 
06:15:33.350 --> 06:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
notarize which a patient can do you can
 
06:15:35.430 --> 06:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
simply bring it down to a notary and
 
06:15:37.270 --> 06:15:37.280 align:start position:0%
have it signed in front of the notary
 
06:15:39.510 --> 06:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
and submit the form
 
06:15:47.510 --> 06:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:49.430 --> 06:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
representative leon thank you mr
 
06:15:49.440 --> 06:15:50.628 align:start position:0%
representative leon thank you mr
chairman

06:15:50.628 --> 06:15:50.638 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
06:15:52.708 --> 06:15:52.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for this amendment and looking
 
06:15:54.948 --> 06:15:54.958 align:start position:0%
at these different options i'm looking
 
06:15:57.750 --> 06:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
at the words in the last line or the
 
06:15:59.750 --> 06:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
form shall be notarized by an official
 
06:16:01.670 --> 06:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
authorized by a governmental authority
 
06:16:03.510 --> 06:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
to notarize the signature
 
06:16:05.510 --> 06:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
is that the way that we normally refer
 
06:16:06.948 --> 06:16:06.958 align:start position:0%
to notaries because that seems really
 
06:16:08.868 --> 06:16:08.878 align:start position:0%
confusing to me well it's the way i
 
06:16:11.590 --> 06:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
wrote it at ten o'clock last night
 
06:16:12.948 --> 06:16:12.958 align:start position:0%
without a migraine yeah without a
 
06:16:14.310 --> 06:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
migraine so
 
06:16:16.868 --> 06:16:16.878 align:start position:0%
i i think it's a little bit more um
 
06:16:18.310 --> 06:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
complicated the way i written it but i
 
06:16:19.670 --> 06:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
think the intent is pretty clear that
 
06:16:21.270 --> 06:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
has to be notarized
 
06:16:22.868 --> 06:16:22.878 align:start position:0%
and i wanted to be sure that someone
 
06:16:24.708 --> 06:16:24.718 align:start position:0%
this is back not knowing the issue about
 
06:16:27.990 --> 06:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
notre notarizing a form that the
 
06:16:29.590 --> 06:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
signature is being notarized not the
 
06:16:29.600 --> 06:16:31.910 align:start position:0%
signature is being notarized not the
form

06:16:31.910 --> 06:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
form
 
06:16:36.628 --> 06:16:36.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:38.310 --> 06:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
i was going to just say that i think it
 
06:16:40.390 --> 06:16:40.400 align:start position:0%
may be more words than are necessary but
 
06:16:42.628 --> 06:16:42.638 align:start position:0%
i think it conveys the meaning that we
 
06:16:44.470 --> 06:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
just want
 
06:16:46.628 --> 06:16:46.638 align:start position:0%
some verification that the person
 
06:16:49.110 --> 06:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
signing the form is not
 
06:16:51.510 --> 06:16:51.520 align:start position:0%
your ex-spouse who's angry at you and
 
06:16:54.230 --> 06:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
has decided to remove all records that
 
06:16:57.190 --> 06:16:57.200 align:start position:0%
you yourself want to keep
 
06:16:59.910 --> 06:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
and it's a relatively easy way of doing
 
06:17:01.750 --> 06:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
it and gets around the problem of those
 
06:17:03.350 --> 06:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
people who don't have their health care
 
06:17:05.350 --> 06:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
provider here
 
06:17:07.190 --> 06:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
you know or have their health care in
 
06:17:09.510 --> 06:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
vermont or maine or whatever it is i
 
06:17:10.788 --> 06:17:10.798 align:start position:0%
think it's a great
 
06:17:13.670 --> 06:17:13.680 align:start position:0%
way of preserving the original intent
 
06:17:16.070 --> 06:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
while making sure that their fraud is a
 
06:17:17.590 --> 06:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
little less easy
 
06:17:19.430 --> 06:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
you just couldn't bring yourself to
 
06:17:23.030 --> 06:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
write notary republican could you
 
06:17:23.040 --> 06:17:25.910 align:start position:0%
write notary republican could you
represent

06:17:25.910 --> 06:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:27.990 --> 06:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
representative connerk
 
06:17:29.590 --> 06:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
thank you i once again would like to
 
06:17:31.430 --> 06:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
just check in with the department about
 
06:17:31.440 --> 06:17:32.830 align:start position:0%
just check in with the department about
something

06:17:32.830 --> 06:17:32.840 align:start position:0%
something
 
06:17:37.430 --> 06:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
on line 13 in the amendment um and this
 
06:17:39.670 --> 06:17:39.680 align:start position:0%
was actually in the original bill to
 
06:17:42.230 --> 06:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
request the removal of information from
 
06:17:44.310 --> 06:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
the registry we heard when we had the
 
06:17:46.150 --> 06:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
previous bill about
 
06:17:49.350 --> 06:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
removal of covert 19 vaccine information
 
06:17:51.110 --> 06:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
which came in under the emergency
 
06:17:51.120 --> 06:17:52.470 align:start position:0%
which came in under the emergency
authorization

06:17:52.470 --> 06:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
authorization
 
06:17:54.708 --> 06:17:54.718 align:start position:0%
that this was the only medical record
 
06:17:57.350 --> 06:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
and those records needed to be retained
 
06:17:58.788 --> 06:17:58.798 align:start position:0%
normally medical records need to be
 
06:18:00.788 --> 06:18:00.798 align:start position:0%
retained for seven years
 
06:18:03.910 --> 06:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
in this case since the provider will
 
06:18:06.230 --> 06:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
have actually given the vaccination is
 
06:18:08.150 --> 06:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
it a fair assumption that the medical
 
06:18:09.590 --> 06:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
record will still be
 
06:18:09.600 --> 06:18:11.190 align:start position:0%
record will still be
preserved

06:18:11.190 --> 06:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
preserved
 
06:18:13.350 --> 06:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
because the medical record resides in
 
06:18:15.990 --> 06:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
the provider's office
 
06:18:17.670 --> 06:18:17.680 align:start position:0%
or will this cause any problem with
 
06:18:19.990 --> 06:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
removing information likewise i guess i
 
06:18:22.070 --> 06:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
would have to say if this would apply to
 
06:18:24.230 --> 06:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
the coveted 19 where there is no other
 
06:18:26.708 --> 06:18:26.718 align:start position:0%
record will this be a problem could the
 
06:18:28.868 --> 06:18:28.878 align:start position:0%
department clarify that for us
 
06:18:30.628 --> 06:18:30.638 align:start position:0%
would the department like to clarify
 
06:18:30.638 --> 06:18:31.350 align:start position:0%
would the department like to clarify
that

06:18:31.350 --> 06:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:18:33.990 --> 06:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
and here they come
 
06:18:36.470 --> 06:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
three of the 2800 people who work at the
 
06:18:36.480 --> 06:18:37.590 align:start position:0%
three of the 2800 people who work at the
department

06:18:37.590 --> 06:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
department
 
06:18:38.788 --> 06:18:38.798 align:start position:0%
or two
 
06:18:38.798 --> 06:18:44.868 align:start position:0%
or two
two

06:18:44.868 --> 06:18:44.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:46.708 --> 06:18:46.718 align:start position:0%
good afternoon committee members and
 
06:18:48.390 --> 06:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner pearson thank you very much
 
06:18:49.830 --> 06:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
ann marie mccary from the department of
 
06:18:52.230 --> 06:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
health and human services immunization
 
06:18:53.670 --> 06:18:53.680 align:start position:0%
section chief
 
06:18:56.548 --> 06:18:56.558 align:start position:0%
that is correct we would be in conflict
 
06:19:00.150 --> 06:19:00.160 align:start position:0%
where if the new hampshire state of
 
06:19:01.670 --> 06:19:01.680 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire was the
 
06:19:04.390 --> 06:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
provider for coving 19 vaccination
 
06:19:05.830 --> 06:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
deleting these
 
06:19:07.990 --> 06:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
records would mean that we would be
 
06:19:11.190 --> 06:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
deleting the only record on file
 
06:19:13.270 --> 06:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
and therefore we would be in conflict
 
06:19:15.190 --> 06:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
with maintaining that medical record for
 
06:19:18.788 --> 06:19:18.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:21.590 --> 06:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up may i ask then can
 
06:19:23.670 --> 06:19:23.680 align:start position:0%
you think of a way to
 
06:19:24.830 --> 06:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
make this
 
06:19:27.590 --> 06:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
workable um
 
06:19:29.350 --> 06:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
would it just be a matter of saying that
 
06:19:32.708 --> 06:19:32.718 align:start position:0%
it requests remove information from
 
06:19:34.468 --> 06:19:34.478 align:start position:0%
after seven years or i mean how do we
 
06:19:36.150 --> 06:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
make this actually work so that it
 
06:19:38.310 --> 06:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't create a conflict but still
 
06:19:39.990 --> 06:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
provides what representative merchant is
 
06:19:42.150 --> 06:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
trying to do
 
06:19:43.910 --> 06:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
i believe that we could handle the forms
 
06:19:45.750 --> 06:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
in a similar way to how we handle the
 
06:19:48.468 --> 06:19:48.478 align:start position:0%
opt-out forms those paper records are
 
06:19:51.190 --> 06:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
kept out of the ias it's a separate
 
06:19:53.190 --> 06:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
system they are paper records that are
 
06:19:56.310 --> 06:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
stored in a hipaa compliant area
 
06:19:58.548 --> 06:19:58.558 align:start position:0%
so follow up again follow up so in other
 
06:20:00.150 --> 06:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
words you could live with this because
 
06:20:02.150 --> 06:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
you would remove them from the registry
 
06:20:03.830 --> 06:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
but you would keep the records we would
 
06:20:05.430 --> 06:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
just have to make sure perhaps that
 
06:20:06.548 --> 06:20:06.558 align:start position:0%
would be something that we'd want to
 
06:20:08.708 --> 06:20:08.718 align:start position:0%
make sure that the population with the
 
06:20:10.868 --> 06:20:10.878 align:start position:0%
public would be aware of that when this
 
06:20:10.878 --> 06:20:11.910 align:start position:0%
public would be aware of that when this
occurs

06:20:11.910 --> 06:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
occurs
 
06:20:14.230 --> 06:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
information would still reside there so
 
06:20:15.750 --> 06:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
they would not all information
 
06:20:17.270 --> 06:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
disappears but the information in the
 
06:20:19.270 --> 06:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
registry would disappear
 
06:20:21.030 --> 06:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
is that correct that would be correct
 
06:20:22.230 --> 06:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
06:20:24.548 --> 06:20:24.558 align:start position:0%
representative merchant
 
06:20:25.750 --> 06:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for that
 
06:20:28.150 --> 06:20:28.160 align:start position:0%
um i want to be clear though the forum
 
06:20:29.990 --> 06:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking about it currently is in
 
06:20:30.000 --> 06:20:31.670 align:start position:0%
we're talking about it currently is in
existence

06:20:31.670 --> 06:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
existence
 
06:20:33.590 --> 06:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
all we're doing at this point in time is
 
06:20:33.600 --> 06:20:34.788 align:start position:0%
all we're doing at this point in time is
allowing

06:20:34.788 --> 06:20:34.798 align:start position:0%
allowing
 
06:20:36.868 --> 06:20:36.878 align:start position:0%
not just only the provider to sign it
 
06:20:38.548 --> 06:20:38.558 align:start position:0%
but a patient to sign as long as it's
 
06:20:40.150 --> 06:20:40.160 align:start position:0%
been authorized so therefore we're still
 
06:20:41.910 --> 06:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
utilizing the form the issue we're
 
06:20:46.468 --> 06:20:46.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:48.948 --> 06:20:48.958 align:start position:0%
yes that is true
 
06:20:50.548 --> 06:20:50.558 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
06:20:52.788 --> 06:20:52.798 align:start position:0%
uh thank you so just to clarify in other
 
06:20:55.270 --> 06:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
words that could be handled in rules
 
06:20:56.310 --> 06:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
with this
 
06:21:08.230 --> 06:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:10.150 --> 06:21:10.160 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i can't hear you sir
 
06:21:11.510 --> 06:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
i think he's just trying to clarify so
 
06:21:13.190 --> 06:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
this is currently done in rules to hold
 
06:21:14.548 --> 06:21:14.558 align:start position:0%
the paper record so it's already being
 
06:21:16.070 --> 06:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
done so it's not an issue that is
 
06:21:16.080 --> 06:21:21.510 align:start position:0%
done so it's not an issue that is
correct

06:21:21.510 --> 06:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:23.190 --> 06:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
06:21:24.708 --> 06:21:24.718 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:21:26.948 --> 06:21:26.958 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm kind of puzzled if we're
 
06:21:28.548 --> 06:21:28.558 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
06:21:28.558 --> 06:21:29.750 align:start position:0%
trying to
remove

06:21:29.750 --> 06:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
remove
 
06:21:31.190 --> 06:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
a record
 
06:21:33.430 --> 06:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
from the registry
 
06:21:37.270 --> 06:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
how is that removal if you're retaining
 
06:21:39.990 --> 06:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:41.510 --> 06:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your question
 
06:21:43.910 --> 06:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
the ias is a specific system the
 
06:21:47.110 --> 06:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
immunization registry that is built to
 
06:21:49.750 --> 06:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
consolidate immunization records so that
 
06:21:51.590 --> 06:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
providers in many different areas could
 
06:21:53.670 --> 06:21:53.680 align:start position:0%
go ahead and access that if we are
 
06:21:55.910 --> 06:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
removing that record from that database
 
06:21:58.548 --> 06:21:58.558 align:start position:0%
that system that record would no longer
 
06:22:00.948 --> 06:22:00.958 align:start position:0%
exist in that system a paper record
 
06:22:03.110 --> 06:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
would not be in a form that could be
 
06:22:05.590 --> 06:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
shared in any way shape or form it would
 
06:22:05.600 --> 06:22:06.548 align:start position:0%
shared in any way shape or form it would
be

06:22:06.548 --> 06:22:06.558 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:22:08.230 --> 06:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
basically stored in the event that we
 
06:22:12.468 --> 06:22:12.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:12.478 --> 06:22:17.190 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

06:22:17.190 --> 06:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:19.910 --> 06:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
it still sounds
 
06:22:23.270 --> 06:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
who could access it i'm i'm
 
06:22:25.190 --> 06:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
not thinking i'm thinking
 
06:22:27.830 --> 06:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
i'm pushing the envelope to the ultimate
 
06:22:30.708 --> 06:22:30.718 align:start position:0%
so i'm not thinking a real incident but
 
06:22:32.150 --> 06:22:32.160 align:start position:0%
if somebody really didn't want their
 
06:22:35.350 --> 06:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
records held anywhere
 
06:22:37.270 --> 06:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
could they
 
06:22:40.628 --> 06:22:40.638 align:start position:0%
opt that there's no paper record or you
 
06:22:42.708 --> 06:22:42.718 align:start position:0%
give the paper record to
 
06:22:45.110 --> 06:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
to the person who got the immunization
 
06:22:46.310 --> 06:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
so they could it was their
 
06:22:48.390 --> 06:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility to keep it
 
06:22:50.468 --> 06:22:50.478 align:start position:0%
medical providers are required by law to
 
06:22:53.110 --> 06:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
retain a record for seven years so just
 
06:22:55.030 --> 06:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
like you would not be able to ask your
 
06:22:58.948 --> 06:22:58.958 align:start position:0%
doctor to delete your record
 
06:23:01.430 --> 06:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
that record has to be retained that's a
 
06:23:01.440 --> 06:23:02.788 align:start position:0%
that record has to be retained that's a
requirement

06:23:02.788 --> 06:23:02.798 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
06:23:04.708 --> 06:23:04.718 align:start position:0%
we would just do it separately outside
 
06:23:07.190 --> 06:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
of the ias so that we would have that
 
06:23:09.030 --> 06:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
record on file to maintain that
 
06:23:10.628 --> 06:23:10.638 align:start position:0%
compliance with maintaining for seven
 
06:23:10.638 --> 06:23:12.150 align:start position:0%
compliance with maintaining for seven
years

06:23:12.150 --> 06:23:12.160 align:start position:0%
years
 
06:23:15.270 --> 06:23:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:17.590 --> 06:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
and just to further beat the dead horse
 
06:23:20.468 --> 06:23:20.478 align:start position:0%
the purpose of all of this is that
 
06:23:22.468 --> 06:23:22.478 align:start position:0%
information in the registry can be
 
06:23:23.990 --> 06:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
shared under certain limited
 
06:23:26.708 --> 06:23:26.718 align:start position:0%
circumstances and the information on a
 
06:23:28.628 --> 06:23:28.638 align:start position:0%
piece of paper in a filing cabinet
 
06:23:30.708 --> 06:23:30.718 align:start position:0%
somewhere is not going to be shared so
 
06:23:32.868 --> 06:23:32.878 align:start position:0%
that somebody who's concerned about
 
06:23:35.510 --> 06:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
their personal information identified
 
06:23:36.788 --> 06:23:36.798 align:start position:0%
being shared
 
06:23:38.948 --> 06:23:38.958 align:start position:0%
is going to have a lot less likelihood
 
06:23:41.110 --> 06:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
of having that happen yes thank you very
 
06:23:42.548 --> 06:23:42.558 align:start position:0%
much for that clarification
 
06:23:45.190 --> 06:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
06:23:47.510 --> 06:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and it's just a
 
06:23:49.830 --> 06:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
further clarification from my friend
 
06:23:51.510 --> 06:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
06:23:53.430 --> 06:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
the only people who
 
06:23:55.190 --> 06:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
whose records the department would be
 
06:23:56.948 --> 06:23:56.958 align:start position:0%
holding on to in the event that they
 
06:23:58.868 --> 06:23:58.878 align:start position:0%
asked for it to be withdrawn
 
06:24:01.030 --> 06:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
it would and it would be somewhere
 
06:24:03.110 --> 06:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
separate from the registry would be
 
06:24:05.270 --> 06:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
those who received
 
06:24:08.070 --> 06:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
immunization from
 
06:24:10.390 --> 06:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
the state
 
06:24:13.430 --> 06:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:15.590 --> 06:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
um yeah just for further clarification
 
06:24:17.830 --> 06:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
it was under emergency order 76 and it
 
06:24:23.510 --> 06:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:26.548 --> 06:24:26.558 align:start position:0%
any further questions on the amendment
 
06:24:29.910 --> 06:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:32.390 --> 06:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
well technically you can i believe your
 
06:24:35.110 --> 06:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
statement should read may you call a
 
06:24:38.628 --> 06:24:38.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:42.150 --> 06:24:42.160 align:start position:0%
we haven't actually done that yet
 
06:24:45.110 --> 06:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
so we need to make a motion for you to
 
06:24:48.708 --> 06:24:48.718 align:start position:0%

668.
 
06:33:21.670 --> 06:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment was necessary because
 
06:33:23.830 --> 06:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
we needed to clarify
 
06:33:23.840 --> 06:33:25.110 align:start position:0%
we needed to clarify
that

06:33:25.110 --> 06:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:33:28.788 --> 06:33:28.798 align:start position:0%
we still had to accommodate
 
06:33:30.948 --> 06:33:30.958 align:start position:0%
federal requirements
 
06:33:34.390 --> 06:33:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:37.030 --> 06:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
there are a few restrictions right now
 
06:33:37.040 --> 06:33:38.070 align:start position:0%
there are a few restrictions right now
for

06:33:38.070 --> 06:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:33:41.430 --> 06:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
on release of a minor a 13 year old and
 
06:33:41.440 --> 06:33:42.468 align:start position:0%
on release of a minor a 13 year old and
above

06:33:42.468 --> 06:33:42.478 align:start position:0%
above
 
06:33:42.478 --> 06:33:43.670 align:start position:0%
above
uh

06:33:43.670 --> 06:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:33:45.270 --> 06:33:45.280 align:start position:0%
to release their records to their
 
06:33:47.030 --> 06:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
parents which
 
06:33:48.948 --> 06:33:48.958 align:start position:0%
accidentally i think
 
06:33:50.868 --> 06:33:50.878 align:start position:0%
got passed when they were trying to
 
06:33:53.430 --> 06:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
protect certain records
 
06:33:53.440 --> 06:33:54.390 align:start position:0%
protect certain records
of

06:33:54.390 --> 06:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:33:56.230 --> 06:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
of a teenager
 
06:33:59.510 --> 06:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
they kind of overstepped and just said
 
06:34:01.670 --> 06:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
a parent had no access to their
 
06:34:04.548 --> 06:34:04.558 align:start position:0%
teenager's records unless the child
 
06:34:05.670 --> 06:34:05.680 align:start position:0%
wrote them
 
06:34:10.628 --> 06:34:10.638 align:start position:0%
a release which is extremely burdensome
 
06:34:10.638 --> 06:34:11.990 align:start position:0%
a release which is extremely burdensome
to

06:34:11.990 --> 06:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:34:15.350 --> 06:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
parents and i would expect two providers
 
06:34:17.990 --> 06:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
to keep those records
 
06:34:20.708 --> 06:34:20.718 align:start position:0%
but you have to
 
06:34:22.788 --> 06:34:22.798 align:start position:0%
you have to accommodate the fact that
 
06:34:25.270 --> 06:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
there are federal requirements
 
06:34:28.708 --> 06:34:28.718 align:start position:0%
and there is a specific
 
06:34:28.718 --> 06:34:29.510 align:start position:0%
and there is a specific
uh

06:34:29.510 --> 06:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:34:31.430 --> 06:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire law
 
06:34:31.440 --> 06:34:32.628 align:start position:0%
new hampshire law
prohibiting

06:34:32.628 --> 06:34:32.638 align:start position:0%
prohibiting
 
06:34:35.670 --> 06:34:35.680 align:start position:0%
uh just releasing
 
06:34:36.788 --> 06:34:36.798 align:start position:0%
a certain
 
06:34:38.070 --> 06:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
type of
 
06:34:38.080 --> 06:34:39.270 align:start position:0%
type of
treatment

06:34:39.270 --> 06:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
06:34:41.190 --> 06:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
so that has to be
 
06:34:43.510 --> 06:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
that i had to put that back in the
 
06:34:45.270 --> 06:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
in the uh
 
06:34:45.280 --> 06:34:46.788 align:start position:0%
in the uh
bill

06:34:46.788 --> 06:34:46.798 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:34:49.830 --> 06:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
so that's why the what was added was
 
06:34:53.190 --> 06:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
line eight in the amendment
 
06:34:55.910 --> 06:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
as directed by federal or specific state
 
06:34:55.920 --> 06:35:02.390 align:start position:0%
as directed by federal or specific state
law

06:35:02.390 --> 06:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:04.788 --> 06:35:04.798 align:start position:0%
any comments or questions representative
 
06:35:04.798 --> 06:35:07.190 align:start position:0%
any comments or questions representative
merchant

06:35:07.190 --> 06:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
merchant
 
06:35:08.310 --> 06:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
i want to say thank you to
 
06:35:09.590 --> 06:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
representative gay for making the
 
06:35:11.270 --> 06:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
clarification because i think this does
 
06:35:12.868 --> 06:35:12.878 align:start position:0%
clarify a lot of things
 
06:35:14.948 --> 06:35:14.958 align:start position:0%
and what it really comes down to is that
 
06:35:16.628 --> 06:35:16.638 align:start position:0%
if there is a
 
06:35:19.270 --> 06:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
federal or specific state law we have to
 
06:35:20.548 --> 06:35:20.558 align:start position:0%
honor that
 
06:35:22.708 --> 06:35:22.718 align:start position:0%
for multiple reasons so therefore by
 
06:35:24.628 --> 06:35:24.638 align:start position:0%
adding those words into your amendment i
 
06:35:27.110 --> 06:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
think it clarifies it immensely
 
06:35:34.468 --> 06:35:34.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:36.708 --> 06:35:36.718 align:start position:0%

that we would not discuss his death
 
06:39:10.390 --> 06:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
online until an official statement has
 
06:39:11.750 --> 06:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
been released and that would not be
 
06:39:14.150 --> 06:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
until at least this evening so we can
 
06:39:16.070 --> 06:39:16.080 align:start position:0%

not to do
 
06:39:34.868 --> 06:39:34.878 align:start position:0%
i would suggest that we wait and find
 
06:39:37.270 --> 06:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
out what the family's wishes are because
 
06:39:39.270 --> 06:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
they might have an alternative
 
06:39:39.280 --> 06:39:40.468 align:start position:0%
they might have an alternative
suggestion

06:39:40.468 --> 06:39:40.478 align:start position:0%
suggestion
 
06:39:42.310 --> 06:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
uh but i think it's a very kind and
 
06:39:42.320 --> 06:39:43.510 align:start position:0%
uh but i think it's a very kind and
welcome

um
 
06:40:02.070 --> 06:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
i would like to open reopen the um
 
06:40:06.150 --> 06:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
discussion on uh 1044
 
06:40:08.628 --> 06:40:08.638 align:start position:0%
that we had looked at before
 
06:40:11.830 --> 06:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
the ruling of the speaker is the
 
06:40:16.070 --> 06:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
amendment to this is non-germane
 
06:40:18.708 --> 06:40:18.718 align:start position:0%
it has been requested that there be a
 
06:40:21.350 --> 06:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
hearing on this the calendar doesn't
 
06:40:25.350 --> 06:40:25.360 align:start position:0%
allow it i will not do that
 
06:40:27.350 --> 06:40:27.360 align:start position:0%
the question is for later and my
 
06:40:30.230 --> 06:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
suggestion to the um
 
06:40:30.240 --> 06:40:31.190 align:start position:0%
suggestion to the um
prime

06:40:31.190 --> 06:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
prime
 
06:40:32.948 --> 06:40:32.958 align:start position:0%
sponsor of well actually the prime
 
06:40:35.990 --> 06:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor no the sponsor of the amendment
 
06:40:38.628 --> 06:40:38.638 align:start position:0%
is that you work with the senate
 
06:40:41.510 --> 06:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
committee on whatever bill is closest to
 
06:40:41.520 --> 06:40:42.628 align:start position:0%
committee on whatever bill is closest to
this

06:40:42.628 --> 06:40:42.638 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:40:45.670 --> 06:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
and then um you will come up with if you
 
06:40:48.628 --> 06:40:48.638 align:start position:0%
choose an amendment that is close enough
 
06:40:50.150 --> 06:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't have to be ruled
 
06:40:53.350 --> 06:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
non-germane that makes life easier so i
 
06:40:54.868 --> 06:40:54.878 align:start position:0%
would say talk to the senate
 
06:40:57.430 --> 06:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
counterparts find out what they've got
 
06:40:59.750 --> 06:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
and when we take bills on crossover
 
06:41:05.110 --> 06:41:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:05.120 --> 06:41:05.910 align:start position:0%
 
well

06:41:05.910 --> 06:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:41:08.788 --> 06:41:08.798 align:start position:0%
i do have an amendment here for us to
 
06:41:10.468 --> 06:41:10.478 align:start position:0%
send over to the senate
 
06:41:12.230 --> 06:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
in the hopes that
 
06:41:14.310 --> 06:41:14.320 align:start position:0%
if we find we do need to make those
 
06:41:16.070 --> 06:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
non-german changes
 
06:41:17.670 --> 06:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
we can take that up in a senate
 
06:41:19.430 --> 06:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
committee later
 
06:41:21.830 --> 06:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
all right i've just received this
 
06:41:23.990 --> 06:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
amendment representative
 
06:41:24.000 --> 06:41:26.868 align:start position:0%
amendment representative
weber

06:41:26.868 --> 06:41:26.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:28.628 --> 06:41:28.638 align:start position:0%
i think that's answered my question i
 
06:41:30.868 --> 06:41:30.878 align:start position:0%
was going to ask what you were proposing
 
06:41:32.468 --> 06:41:32.478 align:start position:0%
to do with the bill in the interim but
 
06:41:33.830 --> 06:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
if we're going to look at a different
 
06:41:35.430 --> 06:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
amendment we can proceed to a different
 
06:41:37.590 --> 06:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
amendment we can and and take a look at
 
06:41:40.070 --> 06:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:43.430 --> 06:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
those of you who are really wise at this
 
06:41:43.440 --> 06:41:44.868 align:start position:0%
those of you who are really wise at this
um

06:41:44.868 --> 06:41:44.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:41:47.750 --> 06:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
sort of things see how close it looks
 
06:41:50.708 --> 06:41:50.718 align:start position:0%
because if it is not close we have to
 
06:41:52.708 --> 06:41:52.718 align:start position:0%
have another ruling on the germaness of
 
06:41:54.548 --> 06:41:54.558 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
06:41:56.868 --> 06:41:56.878 align:start position:0%
my guess is that representative cushman
 
06:41:58.390 --> 06:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
being a good writer has probably
 
06:42:01.030 --> 06:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
presented us with something that is
 
06:42:01.040 --> 06:42:02.948 align:start position:0%
presented us with something that is
germane

06:42:02.948 --> 06:42:02.958 align:start position:0%
germane
 
06:42:05.430 --> 06:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i i did speak to
 
06:42:09.590 --> 06:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
speaker packard and the issue were the
 
06:42:12.868 --> 06:42:12.878 align:start position:0%
uh two additional sections of that bill
 
06:42:14.390 --> 06:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
um that had to do with the patient bill
 
06:42:15.750 --> 06:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
of rights i mean with that amendment
 
06:42:17.030 --> 06:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
that had to do with the patient bill of
 
06:42:19.430 --> 06:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
rights so this
 
06:42:20.708 --> 06:42:20.718 align:start position:0%
is just
 
06:42:20.718 --> 06:42:22.150 align:start position:0%
is just
um

06:42:22.150 --> 06:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:42:24.070 --> 06:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
an amendment to the first part of the
 
06:42:25.910 --> 06:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
bill looks very much more like the
 
06:42:29.670 --> 06:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
original bill it just adds the words uh
 
06:42:31.670 --> 06:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
operates on a membership-based business
 
06:42:31.680 --> 06:42:39.910 align:start position:0%
operates on a membership-based business
model

06:42:39.910 --> 06:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:43.750 --> 06:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:45.750 --> 06:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the clarification i
 
06:42:47.670 --> 06:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
certainly appreciate the removal of the
 
06:42:49.830 --> 06:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
non-germane portion and and this
 
06:42:49.840 --> 06:42:51.110 align:start position:0%
non-germane portion and and this
certainly

06:42:51.110 --> 06:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
06:42:53.190 --> 06:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
is simply a modification of the original
 
06:42:53.200 --> 06:42:54.628 align:start position:0%
is simply a modification of the original
bill

06:42:54.628 --> 06:42:54.638 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:42:57.110 --> 06:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
i'm still against it for all the reasons
 
06:42:58.548 --> 06:42:58.558 align:start position:0%
we said earlier and i'm not going to
 
06:43:00.548 --> 06:43:00.558 align:start position:0%
bother to repeat them because
 
06:43:04.788 --> 06:43:04.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:07.750 --> 06:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
and i completely agree and
 
06:43:10.390 --> 06:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
for the sake of brevity i would move
 
06:43:12.708 --> 06:43:12.718 align:start position:0%
that we adopt amendment
 
06:43:12.718 --> 06:43:16.390 align:start position:0%
that we adopt amendment
2022-1

06:43:16.390 --> 06:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:20.390 --> 06:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:23.430 --> 06:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh one second please hold that thought
 
06:43:23.440 --> 06:43:24.788 align:start position:0%
uh one second please hold that thought
um

06:43:24.788 --> 06:43:24.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:43:26.310 --> 06:43:26.320 align:start position:0%
choking in the paperwork here
 
06:43:26.320 --> 06:43:27.990 align:start position:0%
choking in the paperwork here
momentarily

06:43:27.990 --> 06:43:28.000 align:start position:0%

06:43:30.390 --> 06:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
okay amendment
 
06:43:32.548 --> 06:43:32.558 align:start position:0%

06:43:38.628 --> 06:43:38.638 align:start position:0%
and representative cofold seconds this
 
06:43:49.670 --> 06:43:49.680 align:start position:0%

06:43:54.948 --> 06:43:54.958 align:start position:0%
i will oppose the amendment for the same
 
06:43:56.788 --> 06:43:56.798 align:start position:0%
reason that i continue to oppose the
 
06:43:56.798 --> 06:43:58.150 align:start position:0%

bill
 
06:44:02.150 --> 06:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
and that is that this is highly likely
 
06:44:04.310 --> 06:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
to bankrupt our critical access
 
06:44:04.320 --> 06:44:05.830 align:start position:0%
to bankrupt our critical access
hospitals

06:44:05.830 --> 06:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
06:44:05.840 --> 06:44:07.030 align:start position:0%
hospitals
who

06:44:07.030 --> 06:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
who
 
06:44:10.708 --> 06:44:10.718 align:start position:0%
if they lose a even just a small portion
 
06:44:11.750 --> 06:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
of their
 
06:44:13.030 --> 06:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
private payer
 
06:44:14.390 --> 06:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
or insured
 
06:44:16.070 --> 06:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
boxes not insured
 
06:44:17.990 --> 06:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
private payer i know there's those who
 
06:44:19.110 --> 06:44:19.120 align:start position:0%
can pay
 
06:44:20.868 --> 06:44:20.878 align:start position:0%
if they leave
 
06:44:23.270 --> 06:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
they will not be able to stay afloat and
 
06:44:24.948 --> 06:44:24.958 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to cut services
 
06:44:27.910 --> 06:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
and for those of us in rural areas
 
06:44:30.310 --> 06:44:30.320 align:start position:0%
the emergency services
 
06:44:32.230 --> 06:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
maternity services
 
06:44:34.708 --> 06:44:34.718 align:start position:0%
are critical to our area
 
06:44:36.150 --> 06:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
because you don't have a lot of time
 
06:44:37.910 --> 06:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily to go driving off to a
 
06:44:39.670 --> 06:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
hospital 100 miles away to have your
 
06:44:41.510 --> 06:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
baby or to get taken care of when you
 
06:44:44.070 --> 06:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
get run over by a car
 
06:44:46.468 --> 06:44:46.478 align:start position:0%
it does create also a two-tiered health
 
06:44:49.270 --> 06:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
care system those who can pay and then
 
06:44:50.788 --> 06:44:50.798 align:start position:0%
the rest of the people
 
06:44:52.070 --> 06:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
it's not even that they're going to get
 
06:44:53.990 --> 06:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
secondary care but they're likely to
 
06:44:55.750 --> 06:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
receive potentially
 
06:44:57.430 --> 06:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
no care
 
06:44:59.270 --> 06:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
because if you cannot
 
06:45:00.708 --> 06:45:00.718 align:start position:0%
stay afloat
 
06:45:02.868 --> 06:45:02.878 align:start position:0%
as a critical access hospital by losing
 
06:45:04.548 --> 06:45:04.558 align:start position:0%
your revenue
 
06:45:06.390 --> 06:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
the services will be gone
 
06:45:07.830 --> 06:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
and again we have seen that particularly
 
06:45:09.350 --> 06:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
with the closure of some maternity
 
06:45:09.360 --> 06:45:10.708 align:start position:0%
with the closure of some maternity
services

06:45:10.708 --> 06:45:10.718 align:start position:0%
services
 
06:45:11.990 --> 06:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
06:45:14.628 --> 06:45:14.638 align:start position:0%
when they've just not been able to
 
06:45:16.548 --> 06:45:16.558 align:start position:0%
keep in the in the bla in the black
 
06:45:17.990 --> 06:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
they're in the red chronically and they
 
06:45:20.390 --> 06:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
have to cut services that lose money and
 
06:45:22.628 --> 06:45:22.638 align:start position:0%
this is a real problem
 
06:45:24.868 --> 06:45:24.878 align:start position:0%
to our providing health care
 
06:45:27.750 --> 06:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
particularly in our rural areas
 
06:45:30.390 --> 06:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
so i think it has
 
06:45:31.510 --> 06:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if i want to call them
 
06:45:33.030 --> 06:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
unintended maybe they're intended but
 
06:45:35.670 --> 06:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
they have clear unintended consequences
 
06:45:38.230 --> 06:45:38.240 align:start position:0%
of denying health care to a large swath
 
06:45:44.150 --> 06:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:48.150 --> 06:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
chair has two thoughts um
 
06:45:49.670 --> 06:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
one as you know
 
06:45:53.110 --> 06:45:53.120 align:start position:0%

facility in kingston
 
06:46:03.430 --> 06:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
and we are very much an alternative
 
06:46:03.440 --> 06:46:04.628 align:start position:0%
and we are very much an alternative
to

06:46:04.628 --> 06:46:04.638 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:46:06.548 --> 06:46:06.558 align:start position:0%
what we all agree is
 
06:46:08.150 --> 06:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
kind of a messed up
 
06:46:08.160 --> 06:46:10.070 align:start position:0%
kind of a messed up
system

06:46:10.070 --> 06:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
system
 
06:46:12.070 --> 06:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
so my thought is
 
06:46:15.270 --> 06:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
there can be a variety of ways
 
06:46:18.230 --> 06:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
to put different models in place
 
06:46:20.788 --> 06:46:20.798 align:start position:0%
this isn't the only option we have it
 
06:46:20.798 --> 06:46:21.750 align:start position:0%
this isn't the only option we have it
isn't

06:46:21.750 --> 06:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
06:46:23.430 --> 06:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
what's in this bill
 
06:46:23.440 --> 06:46:24.708 align:start position:0%
what's in this bill
versus

06:46:24.708 --> 06:46:24.718 align:start position:0%
versus
 
06:46:26.628 --> 06:46:26.638 align:start position:0%
everything else there are other models
 
06:46:28.628 --> 06:46:28.638 align:start position:0%
there can be many more
 
06:46:30.868 --> 06:46:30.878 align:start position:0%
my second thought is i lived in england
 
06:46:32.310 --> 06:46:32.320 align:start position:0%
for three years
 
06:46:34.948 --> 06:46:34.958 align:start position:0%
and there were private pay hospitals
 
06:46:36.948 --> 06:46:36.958 align:start position:0%
and the local hospitals were not
 
06:46:40.310 --> 06:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
impoverished by there being private pay
 
06:46:43.430 --> 06:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
because you had complete government
 
06:46:46.628 --> 06:46:46.638 align:start position:0%
funded socialized medicine so if you
 
06:46:48.468 --> 06:46:48.478 align:start position:0%
want to put the price if you want to put
 
06:46:50.628 --> 06:46:50.638 align:start position:0%
up private pay hospitals and skim up the
 
06:46:52.948 --> 06:46:52.958 align:start position:0%
cream be prepared that the next step
 
06:46:54.948 --> 06:46:54.958 align:start position:0%
will be complete european style
 
06:46:56.548 --> 06:46:56.558 align:start position:0%
socialized medicine and if you don't
 
06:46:59.190 --> 06:46:59.200 align:start position:0%
want that then perhaps you don't want to
 
06:47:00.788 --> 06:47:00.798 align:start position:0%
bankrupt the local
 
06:47:02.868 --> 06:47:02.878 align:start position:0%
hospitals that exist so there's my
 
06:47:02.878 --> 06:47:06.708 align:start position:0%
hospitals that exist so there's my
thoughts

06:47:06.708 --> 06:47:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:09.350 --> 06:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
06:47:12.948 --> 06:47:12.958 align:start position:0%
if i'm if i'm not wrong it seems like a
 
06:47:15.270 --> 06:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
real serious problem is that our
 
06:47:15.280 --> 06:47:16.708 align:start position:0%
real serious problem is that our
medicare

06:47:16.708 --> 06:47:16.718 align:start position:0%
medicare
 
06:47:18.628 --> 06:47:18.638 align:start position:0%
doesn't pay
 
06:47:18.638 --> 06:47:19.990 align:start position:0%
doesn't pay
sufficiently

06:47:19.990 --> 06:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
sufficiently
 
06:47:21.670 --> 06:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
for the services
 
06:47:24.548 --> 06:47:24.558 align:start position:0%
and that seems to be it's being propped
 
06:47:27.190 --> 06:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
up by people paying
 
06:47:29.350 --> 06:47:29.360 align:start position:0%
who who are in short
 
06:47:31.510 --> 06:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
so it seems like that's an issue we
 
06:47:32.788 --> 06:47:32.798 align:start position:0%
really need to
 
06:47:34.230 --> 06:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
to work on
 
06:47:36.868 --> 06:47:36.878 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't know any of it i i could
 
06:47:38.468 --> 06:47:38.478 align:start position:0%
ask you a million questions right now
 
06:47:40.708 --> 06:47:40.718 align:start position:0%
about what's the percentage that we get
 
06:47:42.948 --> 06:47:42.958 align:start position:0%
reimbursed by the federal government are
 
06:47:44.868 --> 06:47:44.878 align:start position:0%
we restricted by the federal government
 
06:47:46.708 --> 06:47:46.718 align:start position:0%
on what we can charge
 
06:47:48.468 --> 06:47:48.478 align:start position:0%
things like that it just seems like that
 
06:47:50.708 --> 06:47:50.718 align:start position:0%
is such a serious issue
 
06:47:55.190 --> 06:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
that it's at the basis of all our costs
 
06:47:55.200 --> 06:47:57.510 align:start position:0%
that it's at the basis of all our costs

thank you mr chairman um i i do
 
06:48:03.990 --> 06:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate that some areas don't have a
 
06:48:06.468 --> 06:48:06.478 align:start position:0%
very robust healthcare market even when
 
06:48:07.830 --> 06:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
there is just the hospital in the
 
06:48:09.990 --> 06:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
critical access hospital
 
06:48:11.350 --> 06:48:11.360 align:start position:0%
when you're looking at people who are
 
06:48:13.510 --> 06:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
putting this would be creating these
 
06:48:13.520 --> 06:48:15.030 align:start position:0%

on the direct pay or membership-based
 
06:48:19.350 --> 06:48:19.360 align:start position:0%
model they're going to need a larger

06:48:26.070 --> 06:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
i i really
 
06:48:27.830 --> 06:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
only see the possibility of this being
 
06:48:30.150 --> 06:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
viable in the highly populated areas in

a giant competition for our established
 
06:48:48.628 --> 06:48:48.638 align:start position:0%
system because a lot of people do enjoy
 
06:48:50.548 --> 06:48:50.558 align:start position:0%
having their insurance coverage
 
06:48:53.110 --> 06:48:53.120 align:start position:0%
but having an option to do this and
 
06:48:55.030 --> 06:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
instead of your insurance company being
 
06:48:56.788 --> 06:48:56.798 align:start position:0%
the ultimate client of the health care
 
06:48:58.708 --> 06:48:58.718 align:start position:0%
system when you're paying you're the one
 
06:49:01.510 --> 06:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
who's paying and it changes the dynamic
 
06:49:04.150 --> 06:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to see us have a chance to
 
06:49:05.510 --> 06:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
offer these facilities here in new
 
06:49:07.350 --> 06:49:07.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire i think it'd be niche i think
 
06:49:09.510 --> 06:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
it'd be small that's what keeps the new

they didn't have those they wouldn't
 
06:49:18.628 --> 06:49:18.638 align:start position:0%
have a chance so i i want to see this

06:49:24.868 --> 06:49:24.878 align:start position:0%
but you just made the important point
 
06:49:29.270 --> 06:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
they have socialized medicine we do not
 
06:49:33.270 --> 06:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
when we do not this will be a problem
 
06:49:35.030 --> 06:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
and so representative pearson made the
 
06:49:37.190 --> 06:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
commentary person made the comment if we
 
06:49:39.670 --> 06:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
did have a system like england and
 
06:49:41.830 --> 06:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
norway also has the same thing
 
06:49:43.350 --> 06:49:43.360 align:start position:0%
then it works fine to have these private
 
06:49:45.270 --> 06:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
things because there everybody has
 
06:49:47.830 --> 06:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
coverage and the coverage actually pays
 
06:49:49.750 --> 06:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
because they invest in it the problem
 
06:49:51.590 --> 06:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
with us is we do not put enough money
 
06:49:53.430 --> 06:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
into medicare or medicaid that is the
 
06:49:56.628 --> 06:49:56.638 align:start position:0%
problem but to quote president trump who
 
06:49:58.390 --> 06:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
knew health care was complex it is
 
06:49:59.910 --> 06:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
complex and it's not a problem we're
 
06:50:01.270 --> 06:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
going to fix here today but the bottom
 
06:50:02.310 --> 06:50:02.320 align:start position:0%
line is
 
06:50:03.670 --> 06:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
the comment you made at the end there
 
06:50:06.230 --> 06:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
was exactly right they have socialized
 
06:50:12.390 --> 06:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:14.868 --> 06:50:14.878 align:start position:0%
representative leon um thank you mr
 
06:50:16.868 --> 06:50:16.878 align:start position:0%
chairman we also have a system that
 
06:50:18.548 --> 06:50:18.558 align:start position:0%
subsidizes health care throughout the
 
06:50:20.150 --> 06:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
whole world through the privately
 
06:50:23.510 --> 06:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
insured americans and uh we have lots of
 
06:50:25.590 --> 06:50:25.600 align:start position:0%
lots of big issues i see this as a small
 
06:50:28.310 --> 06:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
and niche if it does take root but we
 
06:50:29.670 --> 06:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
probably should
 
06:50:31.910 --> 06:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
stop talking start voting
 
06:50:34.468 --> 06:50:34.478 align:start position:0%

06:54:12.230 --> 06:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
and this is the last one that's the last

previously done
 
06:54:50.628 --> 06:54:50.638 align:start position:0%

0996h
 
06:56:28.788 --> 06:56:28.798 align:start position:0%
um so that the last bill we heard was
 
06:56:30.868 --> 06:56:30.878 align:start position:0%
the whole enchilada this is just a small
 
06:56:33.910 --> 06:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
bite i limited
 
06:56:36.788 --> 06:56:36.798 align:start position:0%
my original bill to only apply to
 
06:56:39.110 --> 06:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
nursing homes and rehabs
 
06:56:39.120 --> 06:56:39.910 align:start position:0%
nursing homes and rehabs
so

06:56:39.910 --> 06:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:56:44.390 --> 06:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
and as i discussed in the hearing for
 
06:56:45.670 --> 06:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
for this bill
 
06:56:47.750 --> 06:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
we did need to remove the moratorium on
 
06:56:50.150 --> 06:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
new facilities that was discussed during
 
06:56:52.390 --> 06:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
the hearing
 
06:56:52.400 --> 06:56:53.670 align:start position:0%
the hearing
so

06:56:53.670 --> 06:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:56:55.590 --> 06:56:55.600 align:start position:0%
what you have is the removal of that
 
06:56:57.350 --> 06:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
moratorium for new
 
06:56:59.910 --> 06:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
nursing homes and rehabs if they operate
 
06:57:01.830 --> 06:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
on a membership based business model or
 
06:57:03.670 --> 06:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
exclusively provide services to persons
 
06:57:06.070 --> 06:57:06.080 align:start position:0%
who make direct payment
 
06:57:08.548 --> 06:57:08.558 align:start position:0%
and in section two
 
06:57:11.030 --> 06:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
it exempts these facilities
 
06:57:16.230 --> 06:57:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:18.390 --> 06:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
only nursing homes again intermediate
 
06:57:21.510 --> 06:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
care and rehabs
 
06:57:23.510 --> 06:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
that operate on this so it exempts them
 
06:57:27.190 --> 06:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:30.070 --> 06:57:30.080 align:start position:0%
so they shall
 
06:57:32.390 --> 06:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
not be required to accept all forms of
 
06:57:32.400 --> 06:57:33.590 align:start position:0%
not be required to accept all forms of
payment

06:57:33.590 --> 06:57:33.600 align:start position:0%
payment
 
06:57:35.510 --> 06:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
and they shall not be required to have
 
06:57:35.520 --> 06:57:36.310 align:start position:0%
and they shall not be required to have
the

06:57:36.310 --> 06:57:36.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:57:37.990 --> 06:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
assistance plan for people who are
 
06:57:38.000 --> 06:57:40.230 align:start position:0%
assistance plan for people who are
uninsured

06:57:40.230 --> 06:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
uninsured
 
06:57:41.750 --> 06:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
now i don't think we're going to have
 
06:57:43.830 --> 06:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
the same argument about critical care
 
06:57:45.430 --> 06:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
hospitals closing when this is only
 
06:57:47.830 --> 06:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
nursing homes and rehab so i hope that
 
06:57:50.310 --> 06:57:50.320 align:start position:0%
that barrier being removed that we can
 
06:57:52.310 --> 06:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
come to an agreement you know that this
 
06:57:54.390 --> 06:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
is a good option for people if they want
 
06:57:57.030 --> 06:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
to pay have a different way to pay
 
06:57:59.030 --> 06:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
for nursing care that private facilities
 
06:58:00.708 --> 06:58:00.718 align:start position:0%
should be able to operate in new
 
06:58:00.718 --> 06:58:02.070 align:start position:0%
should be able to operate in new
hampshire

06:58:02.070 --> 06:58:02.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
06:58:05.670 --> 06:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:07.750 --> 06:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
in our county nursing homes and in many
 
06:58:10.628 --> 06:58:10.638 align:start position:0%
other nursing homes the primary provider
 
06:58:14.788 --> 06:58:14.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:16.230 --> 06:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
that is that is how they get the
 
06:58:16.240 --> 06:58:17.830 align:start position:0%
that is that is how they get the
reimbursement

06:58:17.830 --> 06:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
 
06:58:19.270 --> 06:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
we are just going through our budgetary
 
06:58:21.910 --> 06:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
process in carroll county right now
 
06:58:23.670 --> 06:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
and we
 
06:58:25.190 --> 06:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
the majority of our income comes from
 
06:58:26.708 --> 06:58:26.718 align:start position:0%
medicaid we have a small amount from
 
06:58:28.390 --> 06:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
private pay but that small number of
 
06:58:30.548 --> 06:58:30.558 align:start position:0%
private pay people is very important for
 
06:58:30.558 --> 06:58:31.510 align:start position:0%
private pay people is very important for
us

06:58:31.510 --> 06:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
us
 
06:58:33.270 --> 06:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
i would still make precisely the same
 
06:58:35.270 --> 06:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
argument and that is that if you skim
 
06:58:35.280 --> 06:58:36.468 align:start position:0%
argument and that is that if you skim
off

06:58:36.468 --> 06:58:36.478 align:start position:0%
off
 
06:58:38.788 --> 06:58:38.798 align:start position:0%
those private pay people into another
 
06:58:38.798 --> 06:58:40.230 align:start position:0%
those private pay people into another
facility

06:58:40.230 --> 06:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
facility
 
06:58:42.390 --> 06:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
our county nursing homes
 
06:58:45.270 --> 06:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
will not be able to function or well
 
06:58:46.548 --> 06:58:46.558 align:start position:0%
they'll be able to function as long as
 
06:58:48.230 --> 06:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
we increase our property tax rate
 
06:58:48.240 --> 06:58:49.350 align:start position:0%
we increase our property tax rate
immensely

06:58:49.350 --> 06:58:49.360 align:start position:0%
immensely
 
06:58:52.230 --> 06:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
and that's precisely the outcome because
 
06:58:54.230 --> 06:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
let us say that you get 60 of your out
 
06:58:56.788 --> 06:58:56.798 align:start position:0%
income from medicaid and you get 40 from
 
06:58:58.788 --> 06:58:58.798 align:start position:0%
private pay and let's say you only you
 
06:59:00.948 --> 06:59:00.958 align:start position:0%
lose a small amount but you lose let's
 
06:59:02.948 --> 06:59:02.958 align:start position:0%
say 10 percent and
 
06:59:05.270 --> 06:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
for i don't remember the exact number on
 
06:59:07.510 --> 06:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
our earth but i think ours is about 17
 
06:59:09.350 --> 06:59:09.360 align:start position:0%
million dollars and
 
06:59:11.030 --> 06:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
because we're a small one
 
06:59:13.030 --> 06:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
and so i could do the math but i'm not
 
06:59:14.230 --> 06:59:14.240 align:start position:0%
going to worry about the calculation but
 
06:59:15.670 --> 06:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
it's a few million dollars it is going
 
06:59:17.270 --> 06:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
to increase the property tax rate
 
06:59:19.430 --> 06:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
immensely so if you are prepared to
 
06:59:21.110 --> 06:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
increase the property tax rate in your
 
06:59:21.120 --> 06:59:22.070 align:start position:0%
increase the property tax rate in your
county

06:59:22.070 --> 06:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
county
 
06:59:25.190 --> 06:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
this is a wonderful bill if not
 
06:59:26.468 --> 06:59:26.478 align:start position:0%
uh if you're not prepared for that we
 
06:59:28.468 --> 06:59:28.478 align:start position:0%
should not pass this bill and that's
 
06:59:30.948 --> 06:59:30.958 align:start position:0%
only the county nursing homes any other
 
06:59:33.510 --> 06:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
nursing homes who are trying to survive
 
06:59:35.990 --> 06:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
well also then go bankrupt so the
 
06:59:37.510 --> 06:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
various private nursing homes would not
 
06:59:41.910 --> 06:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:41.920 --> 06:59:43.430 align:start position:0%
 
representative

06:59:43.430 --> 06:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:59:43.440 --> 06:59:48.948 align:start position:0%
representative
snow

06:59:48.948 --> 06:59:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:51.590 --> 06:59:51.600 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at uh line 10
 
06:59:53.030 --> 06:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
of the amendment
 
06:59:55.910 --> 06:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
and and that says no new license shall
 
06:59:58.230 --> 06:59:58.240 align:start position:0%
be issued for and there should be no
 
07:00:00.708 --> 07:00:00.718 align:start position:0%
increase in license capacity of any
 
07:00:02.708 --> 07:00:02.718 align:start position:0%
nursing home blah blah blah or any other
 
07:00:05.510 --> 07:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
services unless that person is one of
 
07:00:05.520 --> 07:00:06.468 align:start position:0%
services unless that person is one of
these

07:00:06.468 --> 07:00:06.478 align:start position:0%
these
 
07:00:06.478 --> 07:00:07.350 align:start position:0%
these
uh

07:00:07.350 --> 07:00:07.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:00:09.190 --> 07:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
membership only or pay
 
07:00:11.190 --> 07:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
does this go back does this bring the
 
07:00:14.310 --> 07:00:14.320 align:start position:0%
certificate of need
 
07:00:16.788 --> 07:00:16.798 align:start position:0%
process back so you can't expand or
 
07:00:18.948 --> 07:00:18.958 align:start position:0%
develop a new nursing home unless you go
 
07:00:20.788 --> 07:00:20.798 align:start position:0%
before some government board to be
 
07:00:22.708 --> 07:00:22.718 align:start position:0%
approved that's what it sounds like that
 
07:00:24.868 --> 07:00:24.878 align:start position:0%
is the remainder of the certificate of
 
07:00:27.910 --> 07:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
need law that you read the only part
 
07:00:30.390 --> 07:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
that i'm adding is what's in bold what
 
07:00:32.230 --> 07:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
you what you first read on line 10 is
 
07:00:34.468 --> 07:00:34.478 align:start position:0%
what is currently in law and that was
 
07:00:36.070 --> 07:00:36.080 align:start position:0%
the leftover
 
07:00:38.070 --> 07:00:38.080 align:start position:0%
pieces after the certificate of need
 
07:00:39.750 --> 07:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
board was removed
 
07:00:39.760 --> 07:00:40.548 align:start position:0%
board was removed
they

07:00:40.548 --> 07:00:40.558 align:start position:0%
they
 
07:00:41.910 --> 07:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
one of the conditions of that
 
07:00:43.830 --> 07:00:43.840 align:start position:0%
negotiation was to leave in law that
 
07:00:45.830 --> 07:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
there's a moratorium on
 
07:00:47.990 --> 07:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
new or expanding
 
07:00:49.830 --> 07:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
medical facilities nursing homes and
 
07:00:49.840 --> 07:00:52.628 align:start position:0%
medical facilities nursing homes and
rehabs

07:00:52.628 --> 07:00:52.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:54.150 --> 07:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
and why wouldn't we
 
07:00:56.310 --> 07:00:56.320 align:start position:0%
if we're going to remove
 
07:00:56.320 --> 07:00:57.190 align:start position:0%
if we're going to remove
that

07:00:57.190 --> 07:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:00:59.030 --> 07:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
restriction on
 
07:01:00.708 --> 07:01:00.718 align:start position:0%
existing nursing homes and rehab
 
07:01:03.270 --> 07:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
facilities and only grant it
 
07:01:06.788 --> 07:01:06.798 align:start position:0%
to the membership only and private pay
 
07:01:08.628 --> 07:01:08.638 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't we remove it for everybody
 
07:01:10.788 --> 07:01:10.798 align:start position:0%
why why do we only give these people an
 
07:01:13.030 --> 07:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
advantage over all the existing nursing
 
07:01:13.040 --> 07:01:14.390 align:start position:0%
advantage over all the existing nursing
homes

07:01:14.390 --> 07:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
homes
 
07:01:16.310 --> 07:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
currently in existence
 
07:01:18.150 --> 07:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
well unfortunately
 
07:01:20.070 --> 07:01:20.080 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of pushback on efforts
 
07:01:23.190 --> 07:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
to remove the moratorium for anybody
 
07:01:23.200 --> 07:01:25.030 align:start position:0%
to remove the moratorium for anybody
and

07:01:25.030 --> 07:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:01:27.110 --> 07:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
we're trying to set up an alternative
 
07:01:29.510 --> 07:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
option for people but but you're giving
 
07:01:32.150 --> 07:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
them a distinct advantage by saying
 
07:01:34.310 --> 07:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
they're not subject to the remaining
 
07:01:36.310 --> 07:01:36.320 align:start position:0%
certificate of need process
 
07:01:38.390 --> 07:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
so they can blow it up as much as they
 
07:01:41.430 --> 07:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
want and everybody else can't
 
07:01:43.430 --> 07:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
i find it very
 
07:01:44.948 --> 07:01:44.958 align:start position:0%
ironic that
 
07:01:46.708 --> 07:01:46.718 align:start position:0%
you're talking about having this
 
07:01:48.788 --> 07:01:48.798 align:start position:0%
advantage when
 
07:01:50.390 --> 07:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
this entire conversation on this bill in
 
07:01:52.230 --> 07:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
the last was resistance to removing
 
07:01:56.948 --> 07:01:56.958 align:start position:0%
protectionism from our highly advantaged
 
07:02:00.390 --> 07:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
facilities that currently exist
 
07:02:02.150 --> 07:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
this is to open up the market and
 
07:02:04.230 --> 07:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
provide options currently those
 
07:02:07.670 --> 07:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
facilities that exist now are protected
 
07:02:07.680 --> 07:02:08.390 align:start position:0%
facilities that exist now are protected
by

07:02:08.390 --> 07:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
by
 
07:02:11.430 --> 07:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
laws that ensure there is no competition
 
07:02:12.628 --> 07:02:12.638 align:start position:0%
against them
 
07:02:14.948 --> 07:02:14.958 align:start position:0%
so this is not it's removing a
 
07:02:14.958 --> 07:02:19.350 align:start position:0%
so this is not it's removing a
disadvantage

07:02:19.350 --> 07:02:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:21.830 --> 07:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of these private facilities
 
07:02:23.590 --> 07:02:23.600 align:start position:0%
that are private pay
 
07:02:28.150 --> 07:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:30.390 --> 07:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
07:02:30.400 --> 07:02:33.350 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
canarch

07:02:33.350 --> 07:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:37.590 --> 07:02:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:40.868 --> 07:02:40.878 align:start position:0%
my understanding is this already exists
 
07:02:43.030 --> 07:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
so i don't know why we need the law um
 
07:02:44.948 --> 07:02:44.958 align:start position:0%
i'll give an example and i'll need to
 
07:02:46.948 --> 07:02:46.958 align:start position:0%
confirm this because i have a chance to
 
07:02:47.910 --> 07:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
do this i could do this probably
 
07:02:50.150 --> 07:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
overnight to be sure about this my facts
 
07:02:51.590 --> 07:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
but there are places like kendall
 
07:02:54.548 --> 07:02:54.558 align:start position:0%
hanover which is a private community
 
07:02:56.390 --> 07:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
and therefore you cannot get into
 
07:02:58.788 --> 07:02:58.798 align:start position:0%
kendall unless you have the wealth and
 
07:03:00.230 --> 07:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
the means to do it
 
07:03:01.830 --> 07:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
and they also have nursing homes built
 
07:03:03.510 --> 07:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
into it i don't believe that nursing
 
07:03:05.190 --> 07:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
home the operate
 
07:03:06.948 --> 07:03:06.958 align:start position:0%
has to come under the moratorium of the
 
07:03:09.350 --> 07:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
state because it's privately funded
 
07:03:11.030 --> 07:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
so i commend you for what you're doing
 
07:03:13.270 --> 07:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
representative cushman but i believe
 
07:03:15.430 --> 07:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
that already exists in the market today
 
07:03:17.030 --> 07:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
there are places that people who have
 
07:03:18.788 --> 07:03:18.798 align:start position:0%
the wealth can go
 
07:03:21.190 --> 07:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
without having to worry about
 
07:03:22.708 --> 07:03:22.718 align:start position:0%
the market because the market's already
 
07:03:24.628 --> 07:03:24.638 align:start position:0%
taking care of it that's in my opinion
 
07:03:27.030 --> 07:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
again i can call somebody this evening
 
07:03:31.110 --> 07:03:31.120 align:start position:0%
who i know there to confirm that in fact
 
07:03:33.270 --> 07:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
papers places like kendall which are
 
07:03:34.788 --> 07:03:34.798 align:start position:0%
called residential
 
07:03:37.430 --> 07:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
can you continuum care community
 
07:03:39.270 --> 07:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
are in fact private
 
07:03:42.150 --> 07:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
and they don't take medicare
 
07:03:43.990 --> 07:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
so a residential continuing care
 
07:03:45.750 --> 07:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
community is typically like an assisted
 
07:03:48.150 --> 07:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
living you know it goes from
 
07:03:50.548 --> 07:03:50.558 align:start position:0%
you have on the facility okay you go
 
07:03:52.468 --> 07:03:52.478 align:start position:0%
from independent living
 
07:03:54.230 --> 07:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
to assisted living
 
07:03:56.150 --> 07:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
to a nursing home all in one community
 
07:03:58.310 --> 07:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
but you have to buy into it you have to
 
07:03:59.430 --> 07:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
pay for it
 
07:04:01.350 --> 07:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
there's no subsidization coming from
 
07:04:02.948 --> 07:04:02.958 align:start position:0%
outside sources
 
07:04:04.390 --> 07:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
they will occasionally bill from
 
07:04:06.548 --> 07:04:06.558 align:start position:0%
medicare if they're able to but it's not
 
07:04:09.190 --> 07:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
required you don't have to have it
 
07:04:12.230 --> 07:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
so i just don't understand how
 
07:04:14.070 --> 07:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
that's legal plus we heard from the
 
07:04:15.830 --> 07:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
department before
 
07:04:17.350 --> 07:04:17.360 align:start position:0%
when we were having the conversation on
 
07:04:18.708 --> 07:04:18.718 align:start position:0%
this bill that
 
07:04:20.868 --> 07:04:20.878 align:start position:0%
it was confirmed you can't operate you
 
07:04:23.590 --> 07:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
can't have a nursing home or a rehab
 
07:04:25.750 --> 07:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
that doesn't take medic all payers
 
07:04:29.350 --> 07:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
because they fall under this statute 151
 
07:04:31.830 --> 07:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
colon 2 that
 
07:04:33.110 --> 07:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
you know
 
07:04:34.708 --> 07:04:34.718 align:start position:0%
governs the licensure for these
 
07:04:36.230 --> 07:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
facilities so they can't obtain a
 
07:04:38.788 --> 07:04:38.798 align:start position:0%
license unless they accept all payers
 
07:04:40.628 --> 07:04:40.638 align:start position:0%
they fall under that
 
07:04:43.190 --> 07:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
representative webber
 
07:04:46.150 --> 07:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm loath to put mr williams on the
 
07:04:48.070 --> 07:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
spot but i was about to
 
07:04:50.628 --> 07:04:50.638 align:start position:0%
take i'm going to say that kendall at
 
07:04:52.628 --> 07:04:52.638 align:start position:0%
hanover exists river mead and
 
07:04:54.788 --> 07:04:54.798 align:start position:0%
peterborough exists i'm hearing behind
 
07:04:57.670 --> 07:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
me that a new community just opened in
 
07:05:00.548 --> 07:05:00.558 align:start position:0%
keene so
 
07:05:02.468 --> 07:05:02.478 align:start position:0%
there are two in nashua
 
07:05:05.350 --> 07:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
they are private pay communities that
 
07:05:08.390 --> 07:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
are a continuum of care
 
07:05:11.270 --> 07:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
all over the state and so i'm hoping
 
07:05:13.270 --> 07:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
against hope that they're not all
 
07:05:14.868 --> 07:05:14.878 align:start position:0%
illegal and all of their residents
 
07:05:17.110 --> 07:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
aren't about to be turfed out and i'm
 
07:05:19.270 --> 07:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
hoping that mr williams can explain that
 
07:05:26.628 --> 07:05:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:28.070 --> 07:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
07:05:30.310 --> 07:05:30.320 align:start position:0%
yes the the issue of the
 
07:05:33.110 --> 07:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
continuing care um community residential
 
07:05:36.230 --> 07:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh centers otherwise known as the ccrcs
 
07:05:39.270 --> 07:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
ccrcs have been existence and you've got
 
07:05:41.030 --> 07:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
a very good description of how they
 
07:05:42.788 --> 07:05:42.798 align:start position:0%
operate because they are continuing to
 
07:05:45.430 --> 07:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
care everything from you know from a
 
07:05:47.430 --> 07:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
basic living to moving to assisted
 
07:05:50.948 --> 07:05:50.958 align:start position:0%
living into acute nursing facility care
 
07:05:52.788 --> 07:05:52.798 align:start position:0%
there was legislation brought up within
 
07:05:55.270 --> 07:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
about the last eight years or so
 
07:05:57.270 --> 07:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
dealing with the overlapping authority
 
07:05:58.628 --> 07:05:58.638 align:start position:0%
between the department of health and
 
07:06:00.310 --> 07:06:00.320 align:start position:0%
human services and that of the insurance
 
07:06:02.708 --> 07:06:02.718 align:start position:0%
department because we do
 
07:06:05.350 --> 07:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
license the facilities portion of it but
 
07:06:08.390 --> 07:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of how that they they operate
 
07:06:10.548 --> 07:06:10.558 align:start position:0%
they fall under the insurance statute so
 
07:06:12.230 --> 07:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
if you want legislation for next year to
 
07:06:14.868 --> 07:06:14.878 align:start position:0%
look at this is a issue that has been
 
07:06:16.868 --> 07:06:16.878 align:start position:0%
looked at in the past but never resulted
 
07:06:18.868 --> 07:06:18.878 align:start position:0%
in clarifying legislation
 
07:06:20.628 --> 07:06:20.638 align:start position:0%
between the duties of the department of
 
07:06:23.270 --> 07:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
health and services and that of the crc
 
07:06:26.468 --> 07:06:26.478 align:start position:0%
crcs to my knowledge
 
07:06:28.708 --> 07:06:28.718 align:start position:0%
ccc or whatever it is
 
07:06:28.718 --> 07:06:29.590 align:start position:0%
ccc or whatever it is
are

07:06:29.590 --> 07:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
are
 
07:06:31.670 --> 07:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
are perfectly fine but there is that
 
07:06:33.990 --> 07:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
anomaly of needing to look at that issue
 
07:06:36.948 --> 07:06:36.958 align:start position:0%
if you research bills that were filed by
 
07:06:39.590 --> 07:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
then senator andy sanborn i know this
 
07:06:41.030 --> 07:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
was a very important issue to him
 
07:06:43.350 --> 07:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
because he charged me on a late day i'm
 
07:06:45.830 --> 07:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
sure like this to looking into this and
 
07:06:47.510 --> 07:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
to get a meeting together with
 
07:06:48.788 --> 07:06:48.798 align:start position:0%
representatives from the insurance
 
07:06:50.948 --> 07:06:50.958 align:start position:0%
department to try to see what we can do
 
07:06:52.628 --> 07:06:52.638 align:start position:0%
to vet that
 
07:06:54.230 --> 07:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
far scope from i'm sure the questions
 
07:06:55.750 --> 07:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
here today but i hope that was a
 
07:06:57.670 --> 07:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
responsive to your questions
 
07:07:00.390 --> 07:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
at 4 35 in the afternoon
 
07:07:03.990 --> 07:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
don't tell them that mr williams um
 
07:07:06.948 --> 07:07:06.958 align:start position:0%
the the bill is about a
 
07:07:10.868 --> 07:07:10.878 align:start position:0%
private pay nursing home the answers i'm
 
07:07:14.548 --> 07:07:14.558 align:start position:0%
hearing are about continuum of care
 
07:07:18.468 --> 07:07:18.478 align:start position:0%
the question remains is there any legal
 
07:07:20.628 --> 07:07:20.638 align:start position:0%
private only
 
07:07:23.110 --> 07:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
nursing home not continuum of care in
 
07:07:26.468 --> 07:07:26.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:30.868 --> 07:07:30.878 align:start position:0%
okay um i can confirm that i believe
 
07:07:32.390 --> 07:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
working with attorney john martin who
 
07:07:35.270 --> 07:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
used to oversee those facilities but has
 
07:07:36.948 --> 07:07:36.958 align:start position:0%
not done so for a few years when i
 
07:07:38.468 --> 07:07:38.478 align:start position:0%
talked with them again this is point in
 
07:07:41.190 --> 07:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
time information uh around three or four
 
07:07:43.110 --> 07:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
years ago that there i believe there was
 
07:07:45.990 --> 07:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
one private facility out towards i want
 
07:07:47.670 --> 07:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
to say the stratfor county area of the
 
07:07:49.510 --> 07:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
state um if it
 
07:07:51.830 --> 07:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
if i'm pretty sure meeting your
 
07:07:53.910 --> 07:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
definition but otherwise i'd have to
 
07:07:55.750 --> 07:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
really go back and to identify where we
 
07:07:57.510 --> 07:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
are a point in time now that is dated
 
07:07:57.520 --> 07:07:58.788 align:start position:0%
are a point in time now that is dated
information

07:07:58.788 --> 07:07:58.798 align:start position:0%
information
 
07:08:00.230 --> 07:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
okay representative thank you
 
07:08:02.468 --> 07:08:02.478 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
07:08:04.788 --> 07:08:04.798 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman um i want to
 
07:08:06.628 --> 07:08:06.638 align:start position:0%
go back to um
 
07:08:08.548 --> 07:08:08.558 align:start position:0%
when representative gay was talking
 
07:08:08.558 --> 07:08:09.670 align:start position:0%
when representative gay was talking
about

07:08:09.670 --> 07:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
about
 
07:08:11.910 --> 07:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
medicare and medicaid not paying
 
07:08:13.830 --> 07:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
adequately which is maybe the
 
07:08:13.840 --> 07:08:15.670 align:start position:0%
adequately which is maybe the
foundational

07:08:15.670 --> 07:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
foundational
 
07:08:18.628 --> 07:08:18.638 align:start position:0%
cause for some of these problems and i
 
07:08:21.350 --> 07:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
i wholeheartedly agree and we in new
 
07:08:24.230 --> 07:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire don't have any
 
07:08:27.030 --> 07:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
ability to affect medicare rates but we
 
07:08:29.430 --> 07:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely have the ability to affect
 
07:08:31.110 --> 07:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
medicaid rates
 
07:08:33.590 --> 07:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
so i hope that um
 
07:08:36.070 --> 07:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
we can collaborate on a bill to raise
 
07:08:39.510 --> 07:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
medicaid rates next year
 
07:08:43.270 --> 07:08:43.280 align:start position:0%
um one of my concerns with this um
 
07:08:45.910 --> 07:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
with this bill is that it
 
07:08:45.920 --> 07:08:48.468 align:start position:0%
with this bill is that it
um

07:08:48.468 --> 07:08:48.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:50.628 --> 07:08:50.638 align:start position:0%
it creates a two it's potentially
 
07:08:53.270 --> 07:08:53.280 align:start position:0%
creates a two-tier
 
07:08:56.310 --> 07:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
system of care and i think we already
 
07:09:00.390 --> 07:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
have a two-tier system of care
 
07:09:05.190 --> 07:09:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:07.350 --> 07:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
facility that opened in keene a few
 
07:09:10.788 --> 07:09:10.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:12.548 --> 07:09:12.558 align:start position:0%
you have to be
 
07:09:15.110 --> 07:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
wealthy or upper middle class to be able
 
07:09:17.990 --> 07:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
to afford to go there
 
07:09:19.670 --> 07:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
the county nursing home which in
 
07:09:22.628 --> 07:09:22.638 align:start position:0%
cheshire county is excellent
 
07:09:24.948 --> 07:09:24.958 align:start position:0%
is where all the people who end up who
 
07:09:27.830 --> 07:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
don't have money or who run out of money
 
07:09:30.468 --> 07:09:30.478 align:start position:0%
and have to rely on medicaid so we
 
07:09:32.230 --> 07:09:32.240 align:start position:0%
already have
 
07:09:34.548 --> 07:09:34.558 align:start position:0%
to some degree a two-tier system of care
 
07:09:36.788 --> 07:09:36.798 align:start position:0%
but i think this would just increase
 
07:09:38.390 --> 07:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
that and
 
07:09:40.548 --> 07:09:40.558 align:start position:0%
i'm not in favor of increasing that so i
 
07:09:42.868 --> 07:09:42.878 align:start position:0%
would vote against this bill
 
07:09:46.390 --> 07:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:49.110 --> 07:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
and just to carry that reasoning along a
 
07:09:50.948 --> 07:09:50.958 align:start position:0%
little bit further
 
07:09:52.788 --> 07:09:52.798 align:start position:0%
no this is not going to affect the
 
07:09:54.548 --> 07:09:54.558 align:start position:0%
critical care access hospitals but it
 
07:09:56.070 --> 07:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
certainly affects the county nursing
 
07:09:57.430 --> 07:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
homes and if you go to your county
 
07:09:59.990 --> 07:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
delegation meeting every year
 
07:10:02.628 --> 07:10:02.638 align:start position:0%
the population of the county nursing
 
07:10:04.948 --> 07:10:04.958 align:start position:0%
home is sicker
 
07:10:07.910 --> 07:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
heavier they need more bariatric beds
 
07:10:10.230 --> 07:10:10.240 align:start position:0%
they need more
 
07:10:10.240 --> 07:10:11.910 align:start position:0%
they need more
services

07:10:11.910 --> 07:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
services
 
07:10:13.750 --> 07:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
because the county nursing home is the
 
07:10:16.310 --> 07:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
nursing home of last resort so if you
 
07:10:19.110 --> 07:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
don't have the resources to go anywhere
 
07:10:19.120 --> 07:10:19.990 align:start position:0%
don't have the resources to go anywhere
else

07:10:19.990 --> 07:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
else
 
07:10:22.150 --> 07:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
and if you're a management issue so
 
07:10:24.548 --> 07:10:24.558 align:start position:0%
nobody else wants to take you
 
07:10:26.868 --> 07:10:26.878 align:start position:0%
you go to the county nursing home
 
07:10:29.270 --> 07:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
and different counties have different
 
07:10:31.030 --> 07:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
experience i keep hearing that
 
07:10:32.548 --> 07:10:32.558 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county nursing home
 
07:10:34.468 --> 07:10:34.478 align:start position:0%
actually makes a profit which is
 
07:10:36.868 --> 07:10:36.878 align:start position:0%
astounding to those of us from
 
07:10:39.350 --> 07:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
from cheshire county but we have an
 
07:10:41.430 --> 07:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
excellent nursing home
 
07:10:43.510 --> 07:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
which is the nursing home of last resort
 
07:10:44.948 --> 07:10:44.958 align:start position:0%
but that's done on the back of the
 
07:10:48.548 --> 07:10:48.558 align:start position:0%
taxpayers so if you once again if you
 
07:10:51.750 --> 07:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
skim off the paying patients
 
07:10:56.070 --> 07:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
your property tax rates are going to go
 
07:10:56.080 --> 07:10:58.628 align:start position:0%
your property tax rates are going to go
up

07:10:58.628 --> 07:10:58.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:01.990 --> 07:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
as um the member one of the members of
 
07:11:04.070 --> 07:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
the county delegation for rockingham
 
07:11:06.310 --> 07:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
county that's charged with knowing the
 
07:11:09.190 --> 07:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
nursing home situation i would second
 
07:11:11.350 --> 07:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
what representative webber just said
 
07:11:13.110 --> 07:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
07:11:15.750 --> 07:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you i'm chair of the
 
07:11:18.070 --> 07:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
merrimack county nursing home budget
 
07:11:18.080 --> 07:11:19.110 align:start position:0%
merrimack county nursing home budget
committee

07:11:19.110 --> 07:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
committee
 
07:11:23.670 --> 07:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
uh one don't go far mr williams
 
07:11:25.590 --> 07:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
one of the other things that's not been
 
07:11:28.468 --> 07:11:28.478 align:start position:0%
mentioned is is the domino effect is the
 
07:11:30.548 --> 07:11:30.558 align:start position:0%
fact that one of the serious problems of
 
07:11:32.628 --> 07:11:32.638 align:start position:0%
being able to keep a census up so you
 
07:11:34.230 --> 07:11:34.240 align:start position:0%
can have income
 
07:11:36.468 --> 07:11:36.478 align:start position:0%
is personnel
 
07:11:38.070 --> 07:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
and with
 
07:11:41.110 --> 07:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
competing with the paid
 
07:11:43.430 --> 07:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
those nurses will go there
 
07:11:43.440 --> 07:11:44.468 align:start position:0%
those nurses will go there
therefore

07:11:44.468 --> 07:11:44.478 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
07:11:46.548 --> 07:11:46.558 align:start position:0%
they won't be able to go to the county
 
07:11:48.390 --> 07:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
nursing home and that further
 
07:11:49.910 --> 07:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
exacerbates the problem when you have
 
07:11:51.590 --> 07:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
the domino effect if you don't have the
 
07:11:53.510 --> 07:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
personality you can't keep the census
 
07:11:55.430 --> 07:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
and there we therefore we go farther
 
07:11:58.868 --> 07:11:58.878 align:start position:0%
down so there is that dimension that uh
 
07:12:00.548 --> 07:12:00.558 align:start position:0%
comes into play
 
07:12:00.558 --> 07:12:02.548 align:start position:0%
comes into play
representative

07:12:02.548 --> 07:12:02.558 align:start position:0%
representative
 
07:12:02.558 --> 07:12:04.708 align:start position:0%
representative
canuck

07:12:04.708 --> 07:12:04.718 align:start position:0%
canuck
 
07:12:06.390 --> 07:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
i've already explained why i oppose the
 
07:12:07.990 --> 07:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
bill and the amendment in general but i
 
07:12:09.590 --> 07:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
would also like to bring up that i think
 
07:12:11.270 --> 07:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
07:12:11.280 --> 07:12:12.468 align:start position:0%
this amendment
also

07:12:12.468 --> 07:12:12.478 align:start position:0%
also
 
07:12:15.030 --> 07:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
has a feature in it which is rather
 
07:12:17.110 --> 07:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
non-germane because
 
07:12:19.670 --> 07:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
what the first section is doing
 
07:12:21.030 --> 07:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
is changing
 
07:12:23.110 --> 07:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
the issues about the certificate of need
 
07:12:25.110 --> 07:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
it's modifying that we did not have a
 
07:12:26.868 --> 07:12:26.878 align:start position:0%
hearing on that issue that was not part
 
07:12:28.548 --> 07:12:28.558 align:start position:0%
of the original bill
 
07:12:30.310 --> 07:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
and as a result i think we would be
 
07:12:32.310 --> 07:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
doing a disservice to the public and to
 
07:12:34.230 --> 07:12:34.240 align:start position:0%
the various nursing homes and everybody
 
07:12:34.240 --> 07:12:35.190 align:start position:0%
the various nursing homes and everybody
else

07:12:35.190 --> 07:12:35.200 align:start position:0%
else
 
07:12:38.948 --> 07:12:38.958 align:start position:0%
to consider this amendment and
 
07:12:41.590 --> 07:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
pass it or even not pass it without
 
07:12:43.190 --> 07:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
having a proper public hearing and i
 
07:12:44.390 --> 07:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
don't think we should have a public
 
07:12:46.390 --> 07:12:46.400 align:start position:0%
hearing i think that's amendment should
 
07:12:48.628 --> 07:12:48.638 align:start position:0%
be turned back
 
07:12:50.868 --> 07:12:50.878 align:start position:0%
representative cushman thank you mr
 
07:12:54.390 --> 07:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
chairman i had mentioned this piece as
 
07:12:56.548 --> 07:12:56.558 align:start position:0%
being integral to that bill in my
 
07:12:59.350 --> 07:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
introduction of the bill during the
 
07:12:59.360 --> 07:13:00.390 align:start position:0%
introduction of the bill during the
hearing

07:13:00.390 --> 07:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
07:13:03.270 --> 07:13:03.280 align:start position:0%
and um everyone who was there had an
 
07:13:05.270 --> 07:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity to comment on that that i
 
07:13:07.750 --> 07:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
made it very clear that i wanted the
 
07:13:10.150 --> 07:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
moratorium lifted or i felt that the
 
07:13:10.160 --> 07:13:11.350 align:start position:0%
moratorium lifted or i felt that the
bill

07:13:11.350 --> 07:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
bill
 
07:13:13.590 --> 07:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't work
 
07:13:13.600 --> 07:13:14.468 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't work
um

07:13:14.468 --> 07:13:14.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:13:16.628 --> 07:13:16.638 align:start position:0%
but on the topic of like we're all
 
07:13:18.310 --> 07:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
admitting here that there's a problem i
 
07:13:20.230 --> 07:13:20.240 align:start position:0%
think that it originated with medicare
 
07:13:22.468 --> 07:13:22.478 align:start position:0%
and medicaid in the beginning and
 
07:13:25.590 --> 07:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
insurance i mean these things take away
 
07:13:25.600 --> 07:13:26.390 align:start position:0%
insurance i mean these things take away
from

07:13:26.390 --> 07:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
from
 
07:13:28.788 --> 07:13:28.798 align:start position:0%
the care being the product and instead
 
07:13:31.430 --> 07:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
you're purchasing discounts on the cost
 
07:13:35.910 --> 07:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
of care so it's not transparent um
 
07:13:37.990 --> 07:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
we're not paying for
 
07:13:40.230 --> 07:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
what we're getting we're paying for an
 
07:13:43.270 --> 07:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
intermediary a third party
 
07:13:46.548 --> 07:13:46.558 align:start position:0%
and i definitely don't agree that a one
 
07:13:49.110 --> 07:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
payer system is the way to deal with
 
07:13:51.750 --> 07:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
that i think we need market competition
 
07:13:55.190 --> 07:13:55.200 align:start position:0%
and we need plenty of options and you
 
07:13:58.070 --> 07:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
know to meet the demand and i think that
 
07:14:00.310 --> 07:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
if these alternative options become
 
07:14:03.190 --> 07:14:03.200 align:start position:0%
available adoption will be slow
 
07:14:06.230 --> 07:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
and if it proves that people who that it
 
07:14:06.240 --> 07:14:07.270 align:start position:0%
and if it proves that people who that it
offers

07:14:07.270 --> 07:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
offers
 
07:14:10.150 --> 07:14:10.160 align:start position:0%
better services at a lower cost and
 
07:14:12.070 --> 07:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
makes it affordable for people then
 
07:14:14.628 --> 07:14:14.638 align:start position:0%
there's no harm in eventually
 
07:14:16.948 --> 07:14:16.958 align:start position:0%
those outdated systems
 
07:14:16.958 --> 07:14:18.070 align:start position:0%
those outdated systems
um

07:14:18.070 --> 07:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:14:18.948 --> 07:14:18.958 align:start position:0%
you know
 
07:14:22.150 --> 07:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
fading out and these new systems
 
07:14:25.110 --> 07:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
taking over and you know offering people
 
07:14:26.628 --> 07:14:26.638 align:start position:0%
a better
 
07:14:26.638 --> 07:14:27.670 align:start position:0%
a better
product

07:14:27.670 --> 07:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
product
 
07:14:30.468 --> 07:14:30.478 align:start position:0%
representative cushman um i thought i
 
07:14:32.230 --> 07:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
heard you say please clarify in case i
 
07:14:34.628 --> 07:14:34.638 align:start position:0%
got it wrong this new amendment we're
 
07:14:36.230 --> 07:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
looking at did you run this by the
 
07:14:36.240 --> 07:14:37.510 align:start position:0%
looking at did you run this by the
speaker

07:14:37.510 --> 07:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
07:14:39.990 --> 07:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
i did not run it specifically by him but
 
07:14:42.150 --> 07:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
i told him we talked about what was in
 
07:14:44.150 --> 07:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
the other bill and the patient bill of
 
07:14:46.230 --> 07:14:46.240 align:start position:0%
rights was the
 
07:14:48.628 --> 07:14:48.638 align:start position:0%
all of that language was the main issue
 
07:14:50.628 --> 07:14:50.638 align:start position:0%
okay so you did talk about the
 
07:14:53.190 --> 07:14:53.200 align:start position:0%
amendments that were ruled non-germaine
 
07:14:55.350 --> 07:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
yes along the way to coming up with
 
07:14:57.110 --> 07:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
something that would pass muster yeah
 
07:14:59.110 --> 07:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
hearing you say yes thank you
 
07:15:02.230 --> 07:15:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:04.070 --> 07:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to suggest to everybody
 
07:15:05.590 --> 07:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
that we are not going to solve the
 
07:15:07.350 --> 07:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
problems of the health care industry in
 
07:15:09.270 --> 07:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
the state in in the state of new
 
07:15:10.708 --> 07:15:10.718 align:start position:0%
hampshire or the
 
07:15:13.590 --> 07:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
united states and we only have one small
 
07:15:15.750 --> 07:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
piece in front of us and perhaps it
 
07:15:20.390 --> 07:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:22.070 --> 07:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
i was hoping to solve the health care
 
07:15:22.080 --> 07:15:23.750 align:start position:0%
i was hoping to solve the health care
crisis

07:15:23.750 --> 07:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
crisis
 
07:15:27.030 --> 07:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
another day
 
07:15:27.040 --> 07:15:30.070 align:start position:0%
another day

07:15:31.830 --> 07:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
representative cushman would you care to
 
07:15:34.230 --> 07:15:34.240 align:start position:0%
make a motion
 
07:15:36.548 --> 07:15:36.558 align:start position:0%
i'm going to motion that we adopt the
 
07:15:36.558 --> 07:15:38.310 align:start position:0%
i'm going to motion that we adopt the
amendment

under
 
07:15:58.230 --> 07:15:58.240 align:start position:0%
under this amendment
 
07:16:02.230 --> 07:16:02.240 align:start position:0%
if a person has the money to go into a
 
07:16:03.830 --> 07:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
private pay
 
07:16:05.990 --> 07:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
and runs out of money
 
07:16:08.390 --> 07:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
what happens to that person
 
07:16:11.590 --> 07:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
my mother was in a private pay that
 
07:16:14.468 --> 07:16:14.478 align:start position:0%
accepted medicaid so when she ran out of
 
07:16:17.750 --> 07:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
money she switched over to medicaid
 
07:16:19.990 --> 07:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
but it was private it was the jewish
 
07:16:22.230 --> 07:16:22.240 align:start position:0%
nursing home in houston which is very
 
07:16:23.750 --> 07:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
high quality
 
07:16:25.750 --> 07:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
but i'm trying to understand how that
 
07:16:27.830 --> 07:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
compares to this
 
07:16:30.868 --> 07:16:30.878 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
07:16:33.670 --> 07:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
so in the county nursing home you pay
 
07:16:34.868 --> 07:16:34.878 align:start position:0%
until you
 
07:16:36.948 --> 07:16:36.958 align:start position:0%
qualify for medicaid and then medicaid
 
07:16:38.548 --> 07:16:38.558 align:start position:0%
takes over
 
07:16:38.558 --> 07:16:40.868 align:start position:0%
takes over
in

07:16:40.868 --> 07:16:40.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:40.878 --> 07:16:41.750 align:start position:0%
 
med

07:16:41.750 --> 07:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
med
 
07:16:43.990 --> 07:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
and many other nursing homes have that
 
07:16:45.750 --> 07:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
policy as well
 
07:16:48.830 --> 07:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
but i have been told by our
 
07:16:50.708 --> 07:16:50.718 align:start position:0%
administrator that
 
07:16:52.868 --> 07:16:52.878 align:start position:0%
there are nursing homes that when you
 
07:16:54.628 --> 07:16:54.638 align:start position:0%
run out of money
 
07:16:56.150 --> 07:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
they go then they come to the county
 
07:16:57.590 --> 07:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
nursing home because there isn't
 
07:16:59.670 --> 07:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
anywhere else for them to go
 
07:16:59.680 --> 07:17:01.350 align:start position:0%
anywhere else for them to go
so

07:17:01.350 --> 07:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:17:01.360 --> 07:17:03.110 align:start position:0%
so
if

07:17:03.110 --> 07:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
if
 
07:17:06.468 --> 07:17:06.478 align:start position:0%
because this is a private pay
 
07:17:06.478 --> 07:17:07.990 align:start position:0%
because this is a private pay
model

07:17:07.990 --> 07:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
model
 
07:17:09.830 --> 07:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
and a membership model
 
07:17:11.590 --> 07:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
unless there is some kind of
 
07:17:13.510 --> 07:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
pre-arranged agreement that somebody's
 
07:17:15.510 --> 07:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
going to keep people forever
 
07:17:17.350 --> 07:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
when they run out of money they're going
 
07:17:19.910 --> 07:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
to come to the county nursing home
 
07:17:22.548 --> 07:17:22.558 align:start position:0%
on medicaid
 
07:17:24.788 --> 07:17:24.798 align:start position:0%
representative canuck
 
07:17:26.070 --> 07:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
in other words
 
07:17:27.270 --> 07:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
they'll be kicked out of the nursing
 
07:17:31.750 --> 07:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:35.590 --> 07:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
is that true yeah that's true
 
07:17:37.350 --> 07:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
well i suppose it depends on the policy
 
07:17:38.708 --> 07:17:38.718 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in here that says they
 
07:17:41.430 --> 07:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
can't have a
 
07:17:44.548 --> 07:17:44.558 align:start position:0%
charity care or that the membership
 
07:17:46.548 --> 07:17:46.558 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a lifelong thing that you
 
07:17:49.270 --> 07:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
pay into so you pay for your entire care
 
07:17:51.510 --> 07:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
ahead of time i think that the business
 
07:17:53.270 --> 07:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
model is up to the entrepreneurs who
 
07:17:54.948 --> 07:17:54.958 align:start position:0%
want to start the business and there are
 
07:17:54.958 --> 07:17:56.468 align:start position:0%
want to start the business and there are
options

07:17:56.468 --> 07:17:56.478 align:start position:0%
options
 
07:17:58.388 --> 07:17:58.398 align:start position:0%
to deal with that and people are
 
07:17:59.590 --> 07:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
creative when they're starting
 
07:18:01.190 --> 07:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
businesses and people who start these
 
07:18:04.628 --> 07:18:04.638 align:start position:0%
businesses want to help people generally
 
07:18:04.638 --> 07:18:05.670 align:start position:0%
businesses want to help people generally
but

07:18:05.670 --> 07:18:05.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:18:05.680 --> 07:18:07.190 align:start position:0%
but
but

07:18:07.190 --> 07:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:18:08.788 --> 07:18:08.798 align:start position:0%
one option
 
07:18:09.990 --> 07:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
is when
 
07:18:12.868 --> 07:18:12.878 align:start position:0%
the patient runs out of money
 
07:18:14.548 --> 07:18:14.558 align:start position:0%
you gotta go
 
07:18:16.628 --> 07:18:16.638 align:start position:0%
there's only so many charity cases an
 
07:18:19.270 --> 07:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
organization can have i think of my mom
 
07:18:21.510 --> 07:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
who was in one in massachusetts
 
07:18:23.750 --> 07:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
and there was only so many that they
 
07:18:25.190 --> 07:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
could carry
 
07:18:27.270 --> 07:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
there were models where you sign over
 
07:18:30.230 --> 07:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
all of your property to the nursing home
 
07:18:32.230 --> 07:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
and they might say okay we now own a
 
07:18:34.708 --> 07:18:34.718 align:start position:0%
three hundred thousand dollar house and
 
07:18:36.468 --> 07:18:36.478 align:start position:0%
we'll make a deal how many years that'll
 
07:18:38.628 --> 07:18:38.638 align:start position:0%
get you
 
07:18:40.150 --> 07:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
but still
 
07:18:42.628 --> 07:18:42.638 align:start position:0%
they have to run a business
 
07:18:44.388 --> 07:18:44.398 align:start position:0%
even if they allow themselves a low
 
07:18:46.310 --> 07:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
profit margin they have to run
 
07:18:48.468 --> 07:18:48.478 align:start position:0%
themselves a business and when people
 
07:18:50.070 --> 07:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
stop paying
 
07:18:54.230 --> 07:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
um they can only take so many of those
 
07:18:56.948 --> 07:18:56.958 align:start position:0%
representative merchants
 
07:18:58.468 --> 07:18:58.478 align:start position:0%
i think basically you hit the nail on
 
07:18:59.590 --> 07:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
the head
 
07:19:01.350 --> 07:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
when you deal with the continuing care
 
07:19:03.430 --> 07:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
retirement community
 
07:19:05.350 --> 07:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
in order to be part of it
 
07:19:07.830 --> 07:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
to ensure from a business model
 
07:19:11.510 --> 07:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
the organization is not
 
07:19:12.948 --> 07:19:12.958 align:start position:0%
go bankrupt
 
07:19:14.948 --> 07:19:14.958 align:start position:0%
you have to front load it
 
07:19:16.468 --> 07:19:16.478 align:start position:0%
i know some of them are charging
 
07:19:18.708 --> 07:19:18.718 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 750 000 to a million
 
07:19:18.718 --> 07:19:19.670 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 750 000 to a million
dollars

07:19:19.670 --> 07:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
07:19:21.590 --> 07:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
entrance fees
 
07:19:23.750 --> 07:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
to guarantee that there's enough money
 
07:19:25.190 --> 07:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
for them to take care of you for the
 
07:19:26.708 --> 07:19:26.718 align:start position:0%
rest of your life
 
07:19:28.230 --> 07:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
on top of that you have to also pay
 
07:19:30.150 --> 07:19:30.160 align:start position:0%
monthly fees
 
07:19:32.070 --> 07:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to go back and said before
 
07:19:34.788 --> 07:19:34.798 align:start position:0%
this business model exists today
 
07:19:36.948 --> 07:19:36.958 align:start position:0%
there's no need for this bill because it
 
07:19:38.948 --> 07:19:38.958 align:start position:0%
does already exist in the state of new
 
07:19:40.868 --> 07:19:40.878 align:start position:0%
hampshire those who have the means and
 
07:19:42.628 --> 07:19:42.638 align:start position:0%
have the funds
 
07:19:45.670 --> 07:19:45.680 align:start position:0%
can acquire that level of care
 
07:19:47.270 --> 07:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
and to be taken care of from the day
 
07:19:49.830 --> 07:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
they move in to the day they move out
 
07:19:51.670 --> 07:19:51.680 align:start position:0%
so therefore i don't think the bill
 
07:19:54.388 --> 07:19:54.398 align:start position:0%
really needs to be addressed or passed
 
07:19:56.310 --> 07:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
because we already have the free market
 
07:20:02.628 --> 07:20:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:04.830 --> 07:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
seeing no further

discussion
 
07:21:45.270 --> 07:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
for me the tiebreaker was if this
 
07:21:49.110 --> 07:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:51.190 --> 07:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
putting it into law again
 
07:21:56.388 --> 07:21:56.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:58.788 --> 07:21:58.798 align:start position:0%
if it's already there okay well that's
 
07:22:00.868 --> 07:22:00.878 align:start position:0%
my thought representative canarch
 
07:22:03.030 --> 07:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
yes but that has to do with these
 
07:22:05.270 --> 07:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
facilities that are the
 
07:22:08.310 --> 07:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
nursing facilities and such that are
 
07:22:10.230 --> 07:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
continuing care
 
07:22:11.830 --> 07:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
we still have
 
07:22:13.430 --> 07:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
our county nursing homes and other
 
07:22:15.430 --> 07:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
nursing homes that are not
 
07:22:16.708 --> 07:22:16.718 align:start position:0%
in that
 
07:22:18.388 --> 07:22:18.398 align:start position:0%
uh the rest of the
 
07:22:21.430 --> 07:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
amendment and actually the original bill
 
07:22:23.910 --> 07:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
does refer to all of that
 
07:22:25.510 --> 07:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
and so we still are going to have the
 
07:22:26.868 --> 07:22:26.878 align:start position:0%
problem that
 
07:22:28.070 --> 07:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
if we're going to do this we should have
 
07:22:30.310 --> 07:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
an amendment to uh help out the counties
 
07:22:32.548 --> 07:22:32.558 align:start position:0%
with backfilling the the
 
07:22:34.150 --> 07:22:34.160 align:start position:0%
downshifting we're going to do to them
 
07:22:35.750 --> 07:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
for property tax
 
07:22:38.788 --> 07:22:38.798 align:start position:0%
because it will still be a problem so
 
07:22:41.030 --> 07:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
yes i agree there are these continuing
 
07:22:42.468 --> 07:22:42.478 align:start position:0%
care communities
 
07:22:45.510 --> 07:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
that uh can pull that off
 
07:22:48.150 --> 07:22:48.160 align:start position:0%
for in a continuum of care but most
 
07:22:50.070 --> 07:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
people are not doing that most people
 
07:22:51.510 --> 07:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
are going to the county nursing home
 
07:22:53.590 --> 07:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
where again as representative weber said
 
07:22:54.948 --> 07:22:54.958 align:start position:0%
they're going to be private paid till
 
07:22:56.388 --> 07:22:56.398 align:start position:0%
they spend on their assets then they
 
07:22:57.910 --> 07:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
become medicare
 
07:23:00.548 --> 07:23:00.558 align:start position:0%
and we then have to pay for them with
 
07:23:03.350 --> 07:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
medicare sorry medicaid medicaid
 
07:23:04.948 --> 07:23:04.958 align:start position:0%
medicaid funds
 
07:23:04.958 --> 07:23:05.990 align:start position:0%
medicaid funds
um

07:23:05.990 --> 07:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:23:07.590 --> 07:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
and if they're in one of these other
 
07:23:09.110 --> 07:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
private places they could just get the
 
07:23:10.708 --> 07:23:10.718 align:start position:0%
boot unless they're in a continuing care
 
07:23:12.708 --> 07:23:12.718 align:start position:0%
thing and have uh given that front-end
 
07:23:12.718 --> 07:23:13.750 align:start position:0%
thing and have uh given that front-end
loading

07:23:13.750 --> 07:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
loading
 
07:23:13.760 --> 07:23:14.548 align:start position:0%
loading
so

07:23:14.548 --> 07:23:14.558 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:23:16.070 --> 07:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
we still are going to see our property
 
07:23:19.670 --> 07:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
taxes rise perhaps substantially
 
07:23:21.190 --> 07:23:21.200 align:start position:0%
to be able to maintain our county
 
07:23:23.190 --> 07:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
nursing homes
 
07:23:25.030 --> 07:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
we just opened a big facility in
 
07:23:27.510 --> 07:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
kingston that is private pay
 
07:23:27.520 --> 07:23:28.788 align:start position:0%
kingston that is private pay
and

07:23:28.788 --> 07:23:28.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:23:30.230 --> 07:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
oh my gosh
 
07:23:31.190 --> 07:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
is it
 
07:23:31.200 --> 07:23:33.030 align:start position:0%
is it
upscale

07:23:33.030 --> 07:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
upscale
 
07:23:35.430 --> 07:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
and since one of my jobs in the county
 
07:23:37.510 --> 07:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
delegation is to look after the nursing
 
07:23:39.750 --> 07:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
homes that was my immediate thought
 
07:23:41.990 --> 07:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
as of yet and this other facility has
 
07:23:43.990 --> 07:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
now been open for three years we have
 
07:23:45.750 --> 07:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
not seen a financial impact on our
 
07:23:47.510 --> 07:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
county nursing home i'm not saying that
 
07:23:49.110 --> 07:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
won't happen in a year or two or three
 
07:23:56.468 --> 07:23:56.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:59.030 --> 07:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
seeing no further discussion the matter
 
07:24:02.150 --> 07:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
before us is house bill
 
07:24:02.160 --> 07:24:04.548 align:start position:0%
before us is house bill
