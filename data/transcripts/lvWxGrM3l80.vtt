Schmidt uh Stafford 19 I'm that's do
 
00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:50.439 align:start position:0%
award one uh and I am the prime sponsor
 
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
as you see of
 
00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
192 um I am a a member of the so-called
 
00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
joint committee on employee
 
00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 align:start position:0%
classification along with representative
 
00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 align:start position:0%
scitec who was actually was on there
 
00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
before I was but then it was off for
 
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 align:start position:0%
couple of um couple of years while he
 
00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 align:start position:0%
was on uh criminal justice the statute
 
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
requires two members of Edna house Edna
 
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
and one member of House
 
00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 align:start position:0%
fiscal uh there are three Senators I
 
00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:25.759 align:start position:0%
think they're approximately in the same
 
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 align:start position:0%
configuration but uh it's a six person
 
00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 align:start position:0%
committee and it's part of the uh part
 
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
of the is the title of the committee
 
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
joint committee on employee
 
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 align:start position:0%
classification it was uh established
 
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
about 30 years ago I think uh before my
 
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 align:start position:0%
time but but the idea of it was to keep
 
00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
the two parties from wrangling over
 
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 align:start position:0%
employee classification and getting into
 
00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
you know as I say wrangling which is uh
 
00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:02.479 align:start position:0%
uh deemed to be counterproductive and I
 
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 align:start position:0%
think it uh has worked well in terms of
 
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 align:start position:0%
getting that out of uh the legislator
 
00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 align:start position:0%
legislator hair um but because the
 
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 align:start position:0%
executive department has to hire people
 
00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:19.759 align:start position:0%
they and they they have a classification
 
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
SE uh
 
00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:24.759 align:start position:0%
system uh so low ranking employees might
 
00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:28.759 align:start position:0%
be a double a uh or double b or
 
00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 align:start position:0%
something like that or just one a or one
 
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 align:start position:0%
B uh and it goes right up to I don't
 
00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:36.919 align:start position:0%
know like FF John higher than that
 
00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.720 align:start position:0%
higher GG um in any case
 
00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759 align:start position:0%
and the legislature employs A A
 
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
specialized company out in San Francisco
 
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 align:start position:0%
I think called corn fairy hay uh and
 
00:05:59.629 --> 00:05:59.639 align:start position:0%
their job is to um monitor the market
 
00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:04.039 align:start position:0%
see what uh What uh rates are across the
 
00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 align:start position:0%
country and so forth and make
 
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
recommendations to us so if a if a
 
00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 align:start position:0%
department comes to us with a particular
 
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
hire that they want to make or somebody
 
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
they want to promote or they want to
 
00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.880 align:start position:0%
change their classification in any way
 
00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
they give us the the the
 
00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 align:start position:0%
jce uh a series of questionnaires that
 
00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
they would put out there to find out
 
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
what people might uh uh offer for
 
00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
qualifications to have such a job and
 
00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:39.759 align:start position:0%
that the agency comes up with a
 
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
particular proposed rating then that
 
00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:44.120 align:start position:0%
comes to the
 
00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:47.479 align:start position:0%
jce for First Step which is what we we
 
00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
recommend that it go to Corn fairy hay
 
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
that's a procedural thing um and then
 
00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
corn fairy hay will come back at some
 
00:06:58.710 --> 00:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
point with their recommendation for what
 
00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:01.479 align:start position:0%
that for what that classification would
 
00:07:04.869 --> 00:07:04.879 align:start position:0%
be then the court the the
 
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:07.160 align:start position:0%
jcec is the
 
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
executive agency if you will that that
 
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.270 align:start position:0%
executive agency if you will that that
approves

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
approves
 
00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:15.879 align:start position:0%
that um uh and after that then it comes
 
00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
here for it to be put into the statute
 
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
then it goes to fiscal which is why we
 
00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:25.240 align:start position:0%
have members of JC and fiscal from the
 
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
house on that it goes to fiscal for
 
00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:30.639 align:start position:0%
being put in the
 
00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:33.800 align:start position:0%
budget and then if that it gets approved
 
00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:35.639 align:start position:0%
at that point then that person can be
 
00:07:38.189 --> 00:07:38.199 align:start position:0%
either promoted or hired or whatever at
 
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:42.360 align:start position:0%
that classification so the the the jcec
 
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:45.800 align:start position:0%
is what's called a ministerial committee
 
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
we are the executive um and uh and then
 
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
comes here for for the next step so this
 
00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
bill is the
 
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
recommendation um if you if you open it
 
00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:00.280 align:start position:0%
up and look at it you'll see a whole
 
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
series of things that have already been
 
00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:03.560 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
jcec they've already been approved and
 
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:11.960 align:start position:0%
now um it's Edna's call to carry out the
 
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
next step any questions about how that
 
00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.869 align:start position:0%
next step any questions about how that
works

00:08:16.869 --> 00:08:16.879 align:start position:0%
works
 
00:08:21.149 --> 00:08:21.159 align:start position:0%
okay so in any case uh I not only do I
 
00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
have this bill
 
00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:26.879 align:start position:0%
192 um but I also have an amendment has
 
00:08:31.029 --> 00:08:31.039 align:start position:0%
that been passed out to all of you no
 
00:08:37.269 --> 00:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
it okay well let's get
 
00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:55.000 align:start position:0%

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
position that's already gone through the
 
00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
jcec process to this piece of
 
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
legislation and this was just omitted it
 
00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
was just omitted yeah it yes it's
 
00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:15.959 align:start position:0%
already gone through that
 
00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
process so this this position that
 
00:10:22.829 --> 00:10:22.839 align:start position:0%
you're asking for in the amendment that
 
00:10:25.389 --> 00:10:25.399 align:start position:0%

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:28.720 align:start position:0%
here this is a letter from cour fa which
 
00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:31.040 align:start position:0%

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:35.480 align:start position:0%
what I don't have an amendment but I can
 
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to representative Schmidt uh
 
00:10:39.629 --> 00:10:39.639 align:start position:0%

Department of Corrections can get an
 
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:43.240 align:start position:0%
amendment that's something that you'll
 
00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:45.800 align:start position:0%
have to do this is just informing this
 
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:48.120 align:start position:0%

is so are there any questions from the
 
00:11:00.269 --> 00:11:00.279 align:start position:0%

00:11:12.069 --> 00:11:12.079 align:start position:0%
list of positions that are in the Bill
 
00:11:13.509 --> 00:11:13.519 align:start position:0%
that's right that's all that the
 
00:11:16.069 --> 00:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
amendment's going to do right just adds
 
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
that o overlooked item I might mention
 
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
that at JCC meetings I was I've been on
 
00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:24.040 align:start position:0%
it for quite some time actually and we
 
00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:27.880 align:start position:0%
actually had two senators come once oh
 
00:11:31.389 --> 00:11:31.399 align:start position:0%
two senators at the same meeting well
 
00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:35.240 align:start position:0%
it's a six it's a six p uh person
 
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:38.720 align:start position:0%
committee three from each chamber but
 
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
obviously if all three de if all three
 
00:11:45.949 --> 00:11:45.959 align:start position:0%
delegates or designes are there from the
 
00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:48.959 align:start position:0%
house uh that's only three people we
 
00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:51.560 align:start position:0%
need one Senator or vice versa some
 
00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
mixture of four and if the Senators
 
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
don't come then we only have three three
 
00:11:58.829 --> 00:11:58.839 align:start position:0%
house members that's not a quorum so it
 
00:12:01.629 --> 00:12:01.639 align:start position:0%
is a problem getting a quorum which is
 
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
why I'm grateful that representative
 
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
scitec was reappointed because he knows
 
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
the drill and and it can be a little
 
00:12:10.269 --> 00:12:10.279 align:start position:0%
confusing the first time around and if I
 
00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
have you all thoroughly confused then we
 
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
can proceed are there any
 
00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:17.800 align:start position:0%
questions okay very good well thank
 
00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:20.680 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:12:23.829 --> 00:12:23.839 align:start position:0%
broa so I just want to be clear as to
 
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:26.240 align:start position:0%
what the amendment is going to it it
 
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
apparently it's on this letter from corn
 
00:12:31.829 --> 00:12:31.839 align:start position:0%
Fair and which
 
00:12:34.269 --> 00:12:34.279 align:start position:0%
line I just want to make sure that I
 
00:12:36.189 --> 00:12:36.199 align:start position:0%
understand which line we're
 
00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
adding or we're
 
00:12:41.629 --> 00:12:41.639 align:start position:0%
amending it would be adding a new a new
 
00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
line I
 
00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
believe is there Corrections this is
 
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
GG okay the the there's already a deputy
 
00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
director of rehabilitative services on
 
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
line 25 and this would presumably add
 
00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
another department of corrections deputy
 
00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
okay so the JCC generally uh kind of
 
00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:17.000 align:start position:0%
rubber stamps what the corn fairy hay
 
00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
recommends usually the the the agency
 
00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:23.720 align:start position:0%
and the corn fairy will agree but if
 
00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:25.720 align:start position:0%
corn faery says it should be higher or
 
00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
lower then it's up to us the JCC which
 
00:13:31.389 --> 00:13:31.399 align:start position:0%
one we're going to go with we generally
 
00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
agree with them that's they're the
 
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
experts that's why we hire them and pay
 
00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:39.320 align:start position:0%
them so they give us the the the most
 
00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
likely correct rating or classification
 
00:13:45.189 --> 00:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
and we rubber stamp it then it comes
 
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
here thank you are represent got a
 
00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
comment except for the coroner that we
 
00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
bumped higher than corn FY because of
 
00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
shortage well the the rating was was may
 
00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
have been Market correct but it turns
 
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
the agency was looking around uh for
 
00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:05.240 align:start position:0%
that person they couldn't get anybody to
 
00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
respond because the rating was too low
 
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
for this area so we approved a higher
 
00:14:13.509 --> 00:14:13.519 align:start position:0%
salary because otherwise we weren't
 
00:14:15.829 --> 00:14:15.839 align:start position:0%
going to get anybody for that corner
 
00:14:23.629 --> 00:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
questions on uh thank you madam chair um
 
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
with this role of the um deputy director
 
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
of medical services within the
 
00:14:33.629 --> 00:14:33.639 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections is that
 
00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
currently in the section where that
 
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
position would be deleted from the
 
00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
current listing and then added to the
 
00:14:40.189 --> 00:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
second or is it just adding to the
 
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
second it I don't know sorry
 
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner I just want to make sure we
 
00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
do this correctly when we get the
 
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
it's good morning for the record my name
 
00:14:59.590 --> 00:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
is Helen Hanks I'm the commissioner of
 
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
the Department of Corrections I
 
00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:02.440 align:start position:0%
apologize it took me a bit to find a
 
00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
place to park um appreciate
 
00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:07.160 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt we identified
 
00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
this was a position that went through
 
00:15:10.949 --> 00:15:10.959 align:start position:0%
the jcec process but wasn't included in
 
00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:12.920 align:start position:0%
the bill and we're hopeful that an
 
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:15.240 align:start position:0%
amendment will come forward to your uh
 
00:15:17.509 --> 00:15:17.519 align:start position:0%
question it's a new unclassified
 
00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
position it is an existing classified
 
00:15:22.629 --> 00:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
position and so we'll extinguish the
 
00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
classified and retain the unclassified
 
00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
so we didn't add a position we changed
 
00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:29.839 align:start position:0%
its classification status thank you
 
00:15:29.839 --> 00:15:34.629 align:start position:0%

00:15:40.189 --> 00:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
position to this list that will
 
00:15:42.829 --> 00:15:42.839 align:start position:0%
accomplish shouldn't we abolish the
 
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:47.040 align:start position:0%

uh thank you madam chair when we put

already included in the ask to go from
 
00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
classified to unclassified to abolish it
 
00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:58.000 align:start position:0%

constituents in graft and 18 my

testimony is not made on behalf of any
 
00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
private employer nor should it be
 
00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:14.120 align:start position:0%
construed to represent the views of any
 
00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:16.840 align:start position:0%

to introduce and voice my strong support
 
00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
for House Bill 435 which seeks simply to
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
clean up and clarify our professional
 
00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:26.120 align:start position:0%
licensure statutes with regard to the
 
00:18:27.789 --> 00:18:27.799 align:start position:0%
field of licensed professional
 
00:18:30.029 --> 00:18:30.039 align:start position:0%
engineering uh and ensure that they
 
00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
accurately reflect current practice HB
 
00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:35.720 align:start position:0%
435 clarifies that professionals working
 
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
in the fields of it it security
 
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:39.880 align:start position:0%
Electronics digital systems and
 
00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:42.520 align:start position:0%
Computing are not engaged in the
 
00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:44.200 align:start position:0%
practice of engineering as defined in
 
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
state law while these fields are highly
 
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
technical they do not require license
 
00:18:51.789 --> 00:18:51.799 align:start position:0%
you as a professional engineer nor have
 
00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
they ever in practice been regulated
 
00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:56.200 align:start position:0%
that way however as the law is currently
 
00:18:58.350 --> 00:18:58.360 align:start position:0%
written there remains ambiguity that
 
00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
suggests they could be which creates
 
00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
legal uncertainty and unnecessary risk
 
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
for professionals working in these
 
00:19:06.669 --> 00:19:06.679 align:start position:0%
fields the bill does not deregulate
 
00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
engineering instead it simply ensures
 
00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:12.280 align:start position:0%
that our laws match reality that is the
 
00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
work being done in it cyber security and
 
00:19:18.149 --> 00:19:18.159 align:start position:0%
digital systems today is not uh
 
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
something where you see a material
 
00:19:24.149 --> 00:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
number of license pees nor are they
 
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
required to put a seal on their work by
 
00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
passing HP 435 we eliminate this gray
 
00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
area we provide regulatory Clarity and
 
00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
we ensure that New Hampshire remains a
 
00:19:36.029 --> 00:19:36.039 align:start position:0%
state that supports technological
 
00:19:38.029 --> 00:19:38.039 align:start position:0%
innovation without unnecessary
 
00:19:38.039 --> 00:19:39.350 align:start position:0%
innovation without unnecessary
bureaucratic

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic
 
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
overreach in preparing this bill uh even
 
00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
before it had been drafted by
 
00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:49.480 align:start position:0%
OLS I spoke with uh at least one of
 
00:19:54.789 --> 00:19:54.799 align:start position:0%
the um the the organizations that uh
 
00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
comes before the state house and
 
00:19:58.909 --> 00:19:58.919 align:start position:0%
advocates for for the uh the practce of
 
00:20:00.909 --> 00:20:00.919 align:start position:0%
Engineering in the state the American
 
00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
Council of engineering
 
00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:04.799 align:start position:0%
companies and I engaged in a number of
 
00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:06.440 align:start position:0%
phone calls with them I engaged in a
 
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
zoom core with uh several of their
 
00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
representatives uh most of whom were uh
 
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
Engineers pees
 
00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:16.520 align:start position:0%
themselves and while we did not arrive
 
00:20:19.549 --> 00:20:19.559 align:start position:0%
at a common understanding on chosen
 
00:20:22.669 --> 00:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
language uh nevertheless what I
 
00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
understood clearly from them is that
 
00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
their interest is limited to to the
 
00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
circumstances where Engineers are
 
00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
required to provide sealed documents in
 
00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:40.120 align:start position:0%
support of uh the you know raft of good
 
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
reasons that this committee well
 
00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
understands that those are already
 
00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
required today uh especially for for
 
00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
Fields such as the Building Trades um
 
00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:50.120 align:start position:0%
and civil engineering and structural
 
00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:54.280 align:start position:0%
engineering and so forth and so uh I'm
 
00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
happy to dive in on this as as the
 
00:20:58.950 --> 00:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
committee sees fit I didn't want to over
 
00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
complicate the issue and I urge the
 
00:21:02.669 --> 00:21:02.679 align:start position:0%
committee to support this Common Sense
 
00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
Bill and move it forward so thank you
 
00:21:06.789 --> 00:21:06.799 align:start position:0%
for your time and I'm happy to yield to
 
00:21:08.669 --> 00:21:08.679 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you are there any
 
00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:11.029 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
representative

00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:11.039 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:21:15.029 --> 00:21:15.039 align:start position:0%
Bailey thank you I am not one but I have
 
00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
encountered people in the past that were
 
00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
electronic Engineers or had degrees and
 
00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
such and they would seem to be
 
00:21:26.269 --> 00:21:26.279 align:start position:0%
excluded so I I can tell you that I am
 
00:21:26.279 --> 00:21:27.110 align:start position:0%
excluded so I I can tell you that I am
one

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:21:32.149 --> 00:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
such um and in writing this bill WR you
 
00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
know drafting the language for this bill
 
00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
I wanted to strike a reasonable balance
 
00:21:38.669 --> 00:21:38.679 align:start position:0%
between excluding the fields where we
 
00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
know that this is just not something
 
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
that that is required in practice uh and
 
00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
not excluding too broad uh of a set of
 
00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
of disciplines to the point where I I
 
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:51.320 align:start position:0%
felt it was going to you know create too
 
00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:53.960 align:start position:0%
much strife and disagreement uh and I'm
 
00:21:55.789 --> 00:21:55.799 align:start position:0%
sure that there will be some people who
 
00:21:57.149 --> 00:21:57.159 align:start position:0%
want to speak in opposition it was
 
00:21:58.950 --> 00:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
interesting to me I checked a few
 
00:22:01.789 --> 00:22:01.799 align:start position:0%
moments ago online for the online
 
00:22:05.149 --> 00:22:05.159 align:start position:0%
testimony and there's a handful of of uh
 
00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
folks have submitted testimony there one
 
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
is um of the three people that have
 
00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:12.200 align:start position:0%
written some some textual responses one
 
00:22:13.789 --> 00:22:13.799 align:start position:0%
is neutral one is in opposition one is
 
00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
supportive and it was interesting to me
 
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
to note that the individual who
 
00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:21.400 align:start position:0%
supported this describes themselves as
 
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
an engineer and as somebody with that
 
00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:25.240 align:start position:0%
kind of a background and the person who
 
00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:28.120 align:start position:0%
was opposed uh is clearly coming at it
 
00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:31.720 align:start position:0%
as uh that this is somehow intended to
 
00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
disenfranchise uh electronic Engineers
 
00:22:36.789 --> 00:22:36.799 align:start position:0%
Information Technology uh professionals
 
00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
and so forth and and lower their
 
00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
salaries and I can tell you as somebody
 
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
who has spent um multiple decades and
 
00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
essentially all of my working life
 
00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:49.240 align:start position:0%
working in these types of fields I have
 
00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
no interest in doing
 
00:22:53.669 --> 00:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
that thank you thank you other questions
 
00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
00:22:59.070 --> 00:22:59.080 align:start position:0%
much represent than is there anybody
 
00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:05.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:07.909 --> 00:23:07.919 align:start position:0%
bill seeing none uh we will close the
 
00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 435 thank you our
 
00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
next bill is scheduled at
 
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
10:30 but I will hand the gavel back
 
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
is there anyone who does not think we
 
00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
should go into executive
 
00:23:46.909 --> 00:23:46.919 align:start position:0%
session all right seeing none in that
 
00:23:49.029 --> 00:23:49.039 align:start position:0%
case as a
 
00:23:51.909 --> 00:23:51.919 align:start position:0%
sponsor I will move out to pass on House
 
00:23:51.919 --> 00:23:53.510 align:start position:0%
sponsor I will move out to pass on House
Bill

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
435 and I will second
 
00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:04.669 --> 00:24:04.679 align:start position:0%
I'll just say that it's it's common it
 
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
it seems to me to be a very common sense
 
00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:12.200 align:start position:0%
exclusion because most software
 
00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
Engineers do not do the sort of things
 
00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
that we require a professional
 
00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
engineer's license for um I've worked in
 
00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:27.039 align:start position:0%
engineering my entire career and the
 
00:24:31.269 --> 00:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
types of engineers who get licensed are
 
00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:33.640 align:start position:0%
structural or civil engineers or
 
00:24:37.029 --> 00:24:37.039 align:start position:0%
mechanical engineers working on various
 
00:24:38.789 --> 00:24:38.799 align:start position:0%
types of
 
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
Machinery that have safety
 
00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
constraints of software for some reason
 
00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:47.720 align:start position:0%
is not normally included and the test to
 
00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:50.120 align:start position:0%
become a licensed Engineers don't deal
 
00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
with software they deal with structures
 
00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:54.269 align:start position:0%
with software they deal with structures
and

00:24:54.269 --> 00:24:54.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:56.549 --> 00:24:56.559 align:start position:0%
mechanics at least at least they did
 
00:24:58.750 --> 00:24:58.760 align:start position:0%
when I was considering taking them and I
 
00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:01.559 align:start position:0%
don't believe it's been added since then
 
00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:03.240 align:start position:0%
so I think that this
 
00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
is clarifying what
 
00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
people are already
 
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
doing representative excuse me
 
00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:13.070 align:start position:0%
doing representative excuse me
representative

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you my significant other is
 
00:25:18.389 --> 00:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
currently in the process of getting her
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
professional engineering license and I I
 
00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
had her look over this and she felt that
 
00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:25.480 align:start position:0%
it was completely fine she's getting uh
 
00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
her uh Masters in environmental
 
00:25:31.029 --> 00:25:31.039 align:start position:0%
engineering and this does not affect
 
00:25:32.549 --> 00:25:32.559 align:start position:0%
environmental engineering civil
 
00:25:35.909 --> 00:25:35.919 align:start position:0%
engineering uh or any of the actual
 
00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
practicing engineering that require PE
 
00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:40.360 align:start position:0%
like you said so uh for that reason I'm
 
00:25:42.669 --> 00:25:42.679 align:start position:0%
going to be supporting the Bill thank
 
00:25:45.029 --> 00:25:45.039 align:start position:0%
you representative Lon uh thank you
 
00:25:46.909 --> 00:25:46.919 align:start position:0%
madam chair um I support this bill
 
00:25:48.269 --> 00:25:48.279 align:start position:0%
because when I was going through school
 
00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:49.960 align:start position:0%
and was surrounded by Engineers I was
 
00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:51.080 align:start position:0%
trying to understand this whole
 
00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
licensing for some engineers and not and
 
00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
essentially it comes down to the
 
00:25:56.909 --> 00:25:56.919 align:start position:0%
Professional Engineers or kind of the
 
00:25:59.470 --> 00:25:59.480 align:start position:0%
physical engineers they're involved in
 
00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:00.760 align:start position:0%
physical things that are out there in
 
00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:02.200 align:start position:0%
the world and not the software the
 
00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:03.640 align:start position:0%
things that could fall down on you or
 
00:26:06.149 --> 00:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
could break physically um and so I think
 
00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
that this is just a common sense
 
00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
clarification of our statutes okay
 
00:26:12.789 --> 00:26:12.799 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative Bailey I
 
00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
guess I'm still trying to understand I'm
 
00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking of somebody I went to high
 
00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:17.480 align:start position:0%
school with so you could imagine it was
 
00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
long ago went to Wentworth in Boston and
 
00:26:23.789 --> 00:26:23.799 align:start position:0%
was an electronic engineer was the
 
00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:26.200 align:start position:0%
degree and worked for many years for
 
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
deck building physical computer
 
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
ERS um would this exclude him Assuming
 
00:26:36.269 --> 00:26:36.279 align:start position:0%
he's still working you
 
00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
know um somebody in that category it was
 
00:26:42.669 --> 00:26:42.679 align:start position:0%
probably probably yes representative SL
 
00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:46.520 align:start position:0%
is that fair then why he doesn't need it
 
00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
he's working it's not software it's
 
00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:53.240 align:start position:0%
Electronics he was working on a physical
 
00:26:58.350 --> 00:26:58.360 align:start position:0%
computer yes thank you thank you so um
 
00:26:59.830 --> 00:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
we seem to have a lot of engineers in
 
00:27:03.149 --> 00:27:03.159 align:start position:0%
the room I'm a chemical engineer and um
 
00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
professional engineering
 
00:27:10.669 --> 00:27:10.679 align:start position:0%
licenses are something that you need in
 
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
a certain type of engineering Li for
 
00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
example Professional Engineers who have
 
00:27:18.549 --> 00:27:18.559 align:start position:0%
a license as a professional engineer
 
00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:19.960 align:start position:0%
it's a PE
 
00:27:23.789 --> 00:27:23.799 align:start position:0%
license um often times have to certify
 
00:27:26.389 --> 00:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
plans and they use a seal that they
 
00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:29.320 align:start position:0%
obtain from the
 
00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:31.510 align:start position:0%
obtain from the
um

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
profession electronic Engineers when
 
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
they build computers do not need that
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
seal so it's just um and neither do
 
00:27:42.549 --> 00:27:42.559 align:start position:0%
chemical Engineers when they build
 
00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
chemical plants because all we do is the
 
00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
schematic of the equations we actually
 
00:27:49.269 --> 00:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
don't build the facility mechanical
 
00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:51.880 align:start position:0%
engineers do and then they need that
 
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
seal so it has nothing to do with
 
00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
letting people do work or any type of of
 
00:28:04.029 --> 00:28:04.039 align:start position:0%
um status in profession it simply is a
 
00:28:07.149 --> 00:28:07.159 align:start position:0%
function of the job that they're doing
 
00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:10.600 align:start position:0%
it's like an architect who builds who
 
00:28:12.909 --> 00:28:12.919 align:start position:0%
who puts together an architectural plan
 
00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
has a seal on that plan that says that
 
00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:17.960 align:start position:0%
they're a certified architect it's the
 
00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:20.440 align:start position:0%
same type of thing it has nothing to do
 
00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
with how great you are at your job or um
 
00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
you know how proficient you are in a
 
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
particular feel it is simply a function
 
00:28:33.669 --> 00:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
of the it's requirement of the role does
 
00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
that help you thank you no
 
00:28:40.389 --> 00:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
repri yeah just had additional context I
 
00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:43.960 align:start position:0%
used to work in uh highly regulated
 
00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:46.840 align:start position:0%
software development um was never
 
00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
required to maintain a license or
 
00:28:50.389 --> 00:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
require a license um essentially the
 
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
safety factors are all brought down to
 
00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:54.760 align:start position:0%
the work product so any concerns about
 
00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh safety in that regulated space is
 
00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:00.360 align:start position:0%
much more focused on uh process and
 
00:29:02.909 --> 00:29:02.919 align:start position:0%
development output um rather than the
 
00:29:02.919 --> 00:29:04.549 align:start position:0%
development output um rather than the
engineers

00:29:04.549 --> 00:29:04.559 align:start position:0%
engineers
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
themselves yes and I will say that as a
 
00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
mechanical engineer working in
 
00:29:13.389 --> 00:29:13.399 align:start position:0%
Aerospace I never needed a license or
 
00:29:16.149 --> 00:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
even after looking at it decided I would
 
00:29:20.509 --> 00:29:20.519 align:start position:0%
get one but for for example my
 
00:29:23.269 --> 00:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
brother-in-law was the chief engineer of
 
00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:26.120 align:start position:0%
the compressor department and he had to
 
00:29:27.669 --> 00:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
have a license because he was signing
 
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
off the final drawings the people that
 
00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:32.120 align:start position:0%
worked for him would develop the designs
 
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
under his guidance and then he would
 
00:29:36.909 --> 00:29:36.919 align:start position:0%
sign off the final drawing and that's
 
00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
the way it works for large organizations
 
00:29:42.509 --> 00:29:42.519 align:start position:0%
smaller organizations if you're going to
 
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
be in business for yourself you need to
 
00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
have the license because there's nobody
 
00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
else to do it representative Pearson so
 
00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:52.120 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's always extraordinary to see
 
00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:54.799 align:start position:0%
the culmination of brain power in a room
 
00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:57.080 align:start position:0%
my my engineering technology degree is
 
00:29:58.990 --> 00:29:59.000 align:start position:0%
in fire protection
 
00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
which is a little bit different in the
 
00:30:04.029 --> 00:30:04.039 align:start position:0%
sense of the the physical although there
 
00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
you know we do um we
 
00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
do create plans that plumbers put
 
00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
together in some in some cases but um I
 
00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:14.840 align:start position:0%
I just I don't want
 
00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
the uh I don't want there to be
 
00:30:19.509 --> 00:30:19.519 align:start position:0%
confusion between electrical engineers
 
00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:21.880 align:start position:0%
and electronics for those of you that
 
00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
are reading that thinking that they're
 
00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:24.760 align:start position:0%
the same thing because they are most
 
00:30:27.269 --> 00:30:27.279 align:start position:0%
definitely not so um electrical
 
00:30:27.279 --> 00:30:28.789 align:start position:0%
definitely not so um electrical
engineers

00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
engineers
 
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
are much different in what they do um in
 
00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:35.960 align:start position:0%
a in practice so so just to just to Cal
 
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
fears on on that one term that that is
 
00:30:42.269 --> 00:30:42.279 align:start position:0%
uh they are not equivalent in any
 
00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
way yes elect electrical engineers deal
 
00:30:48.149 --> 00:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
with things like power lines and
 
00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:50.360 align:start position:0%
Transformer stations and I believe those
 
00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
have to
 
00:30:55.029 --> 00:30:55.039 align:start position:0%
be approved and and reviewed by a
 
00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
professional engineer a piece of
 
00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:06.200 align:start position:0%
but most uh most most people working in
 
00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
software or Electronics would have no
 
00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
clue what to do with designing a uh
 
00:31:15.669 --> 00:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:18.389 --> 00:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
station all right any other questions
 
00:31:18.399 --> 00:31:19.909 align:start position:0%
station all right any other questions
comments

00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
comments
 
00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
issues all right in that case a motion
 
00:31:24.669 --> 00:31:24.679 align:start position:0%
is ought to pass and the clerk can call
 
00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:28.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:30.310 align:start position:0%
 
La

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
La
 
00:31:33.509 --> 00:31:33.519 align:start position:0%
yes the clerk votes yes representative
 
00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
Pearson yes representative Bailey yes
 
00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
representative Shen
 
00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:42.760 align:start position:0%
yes representative sers
 
00:31:48.149 --> 00:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
yes representative yes
 
00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
representative EO yes representative
 
00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
groden yes representative Schmidt yes
 
00:31:58.629 --> 00:31:58.639 align:start position:0%
representative Davis yes
 
00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:02.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
yes representative Heath
 
00:32:08.789 --> 00:32:08.799 align:start position:0%
yes representative stes yes
 
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
representative long yes the chair yes 16
 
00:32:14.269 --> 00:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
for the record that would be
 
00:32:14.279 --> 00:32:15.590 align:start position:0%
for the record that would be
representative

00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
Howard didn't I say that you call him
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
did I do it
 
00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
again I I didn't he the first time you
 
00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
confusion having two first name it's the
 
00:32:27.669 --> 00:32:27.679 align:start position:0%
curse of having a first name as a last
 
00:32:27.679 --> 00:32:32.029 align:start position:0%
curse of having a first name as a last
name

00:32:32.029 --> 00:32:32.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:35.909 --> 00:32:35.919 align:start position:0%
yes all right so um the mo the motion
 
00:32:40.149 --> 00:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
passes 16 to zero is there any objection
 
00:32:40.159 --> 00:32:41.430 align:start position:0%
passes 16 to zero is there any objection
to

00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:43.919 align:start position:0%
consent all right seeing none we'll put
 
00:32:46.389 --> 00:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
that on consent
 
00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
and and I will uh write a report at my
 
00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:52.190 align:start position:0%
and and I will uh write a report at my
earliest

00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:52.200 align:start position:0%
earliest
 
00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
convenience all
 
00:32:59.789 --> 00:32:59.799 align:start position:0%
right opening the hearing on House Bill
 
00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
210 and I'm
 
00:33:30.269 --> 00:33:30.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair good morning
 
00:33:35.789 --> 00:33:35.799 align:start position:0%
Edna I am Tom Corman from what I like to
 
00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
call the fight in 15th Grafton 15 which
 
00:33:41.389 --> 00:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
is Ward three of the fair city of
 
00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
Lebanon here to talk about hb21 about
 
00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
state flags uh there's a handout going
 
00:33:50.149 --> 00:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
around uh called good flag bad flag with
 
00:33:52.029 --> 00:33:52.039 align:start position:0%
principles of flag design we will talk
 
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
about it but first I'm going to show you
 
00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
a bunch of state
 
00:34:00.789 --> 00:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
flags here are 25 state flags you notice
 
00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:04.360 align:start position:0%
that they're all pretty similar uh I've
 
00:34:06.269 --> 00:34:06.279 align:start position:0%
crossed out a couple I'll talk about
 
00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
those for a sec ours is somewhere in
 
00:34:12.909 --> 00:34:12.919 align:start position:0%
here um good luck finding it it's uh
 
00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
where it's uh right here on the uh
 
00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
middle row but it's one of many state
 
00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:23.560 align:start position:0%
flags that uh many of which are called a
 
00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
state seal on a blue bed sheet ours is
 
00:34:28.869 --> 00:34:28.879 align:start position:0%
one of them
 
00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:30.919 align:start position:0%
and I've crossed out a couple of them
 
00:34:33.669 --> 00:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
I've crossed out this one and then this
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
one because those have been changed
 
00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
those are from states that actually
 
00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:41.800 align:start position:0%
decided that their flags were not unique
 
00:34:44.909 --> 00:34:44.919 align:start position:0%
and didn't look uh didn't represent
 
00:34:48.589 --> 00:34:48.599 align:start position:0%
their states so we like to think of New
 
00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as unique I mean I've heard it
 
00:34:54.069 --> 00:34:54.079 align:start position:0%
many times on the floor of the house but
 
00:34:57.870 --> 00:34:57.880 align:start position:0%
our flag is anything but unique and it
 
00:35:01.069 --> 00:35:01.079 align:start position:0%
fails to convey that New Hampshire is
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
unique now there are other states that
 
00:35:08.069 --> 00:35:08.079 align:start position:0%
have much more distinctive
 
00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
Flags okay and you can see many of them
 
00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
here um uh for example New Mexico uh
 
00:35:18.069 --> 00:35:18.079 align:start position:0%
which is this one is considered a very
 
00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:20.440 align:start position:0%
good one everyone knows Texas with the
 
00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
Lone Star Arizona with the
 
00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
sunrise and let's see Ohio which is the
 
00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:28.270 align:start position:0%
sunrise and let's see Ohio which is the
pennant

00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:28.280 align:start position:0%
pennant
 
00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:33.160 align:start position:0%
down here and Maryland the Calbert cross
 
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
flag for Maryland and then the two
 
00:35:38.109 --> 00:35:38.119 align:start position:0%
states that actually changed their Flags
 
00:35:40.589 --> 00:35:40.599 align:start position:0%
Utah which changed their flag to
 
00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
represent a beehive which and Utah being
 
00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
the Beehive State and some Mountains and
 
00:35:48.829 --> 00:35:48.839 align:start position:0%
the most recent one Minnesota this is
 
00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
the new Minnesota flag which actually
 
00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:54.440 align:start position:0%
has essentially the shape of Minnesota
 
00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
in the flag so there are states that
 
00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
have been changing their flag
 
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
designs so the New Hampshire flag
 
00:36:08.109 --> 00:36:08.119 align:start position:0%
violates the vexillological principles
 
00:36:10.349 --> 00:36:10.359 align:start position:0%
vexillology is of course the study of
 
00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
flags as we all know and the New
 
00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire flag violates the principles
 
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
that are in the handout that you have so
 
00:36:20.349 --> 00:36:20.359 align:start position:0%
let's look at the New Hampshire
 
00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:23.560 align:start position:0%
flag I hope you can see this you've all
 
00:36:26.109 --> 00:36:26.119 align:start position:0%
seen the New Hampshire flag before right
 
00:36:29.109 --> 00:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
the state seal on on a blue bed
 
00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
sheet so if you look at the handout it
 
00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
has these principles number one keep it
 
00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
simple so simple that a child can draw
 
00:36:41.349 --> 00:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
it from memory a single simple large
 
00:36:44.349 --> 00:36:44.359 align:start position:0%
shapes the flag should be recognizable
 
00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
from a
 
00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
distance well you know if you had this
 
00:36:49.829 --> 00:36:49.839 align:start position:0%
flag with a bunch of the other flags and
 
00:36:53.109 --> 00:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
a hall of flags such as at the US
 
00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:54.920 align:start position:0%
capital it would be hard to pick out the
 
00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:57.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire flag and in terms of uh
 
00:36:59.870 --> 00:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
that a child could draw it from memory
 
00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:01.640 align:start position:0%
all right take a typical eight-year-old
 
00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
and ask them to draw this and imagine
 
00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:07.480 align:start position:0%
what you're going to get so we fail on
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
that account number two use meaningful
 
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
symbolism images colors and patterns
 
00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
should relate to what the flag
 
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
symbolizes for a symbol consider history
 
00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
cultural heritage emotional value
 
00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
branding usage and stylized or
 
00:37:24.589 --> 00:37:24.599 align:start position:0%
silhouetted symbols are better than
 
00:37:24.599 --> 00:37:25.910 align:start position:0%
silhouetted symbols are better than
realistic

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
realistic
 
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
depictions so what do we have have on
 
00:37:29.349 --> 00:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire flag we have the
 
00:37:31.349 --> 00:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
symbol on the state seal the boat known
 
00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
as the
 
00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
Raleigh what percentage of granite sters
 
00:37:37.069 --> 00:37:37.079 align:start position:0%
could tell you the first thing about the
 
00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:39.400 align:start position:0%
boat on the New Hampshire flag school
 
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
kids May learn something about it um I
 
00:37:44.589 --> 00:37:44.599 align:start position:0%
didn't go to school in New Hampshire so
 
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
I didn't learn anything about the boat I
 
00:37:48.069 --> 00:37:48.079 align:start position:0%
didn't even know the name of it until a
 
00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago and um it wasn't
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
built in New Hampshire it was built in
 
00:37:55.829 --> 00:37:55.839 align:start position:0%
Maine and apparently during the
 
00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
Revolutionary War it was captured by the
 
00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
British and used against the colonists
 
00:38:03.309 --> 00:38:03.319 align:start position:0%
so that's not so great and by the way if
 
00:38:05.589 --> 00:38:05.599 align:start position:0%
you look in the in the state seal it's
 
00:38:05.599 --> 00:38:06.390 align:start position:0%
you look in the in the state seal it's
on

00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
land so it's not even a boat in the
 
00:38:11.349 --> 00:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
water it's a boat on land so I'm not
 
00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:13.640 align:start position:0%
advocating to change the state seal
 
00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:15.640 align:start position:0%
although I think it's not a bad idea
 
00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
just not to use it on the
 
00:38:20.069 --> 00:38:20.079 align:start position:0%
flag next principle use two or three
 
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
basic colors and the basic flag colors
 
00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
are red blue green black yellow or white
 
00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
but don't use all of them use two or
 
00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
three of them and separate the dark
 
00:38:30.589 --> 00:38:30.599 align:start position:0%
colors by the light and the light colors
 
00:38:33.069 --> 00:38:33.079 align:start position:0%
by the dark for contrast if you have
 
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
more than four colors it makes the flag
 
00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:36.680 align:start position:0%
hard to distinguish and hard to
 
00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
reproduce so I actually counted the
 
00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
colors we have we have eight we have
 
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
dark blue gold green red light blue
 
00:38:45.309 --> 00:38:45.319 align:start position:0%
brown black and white so eight colors on
 
00:38:48.829 --> 00:38:48.839 align:start position:0%
our flag and then of course no lettering
 
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
or seals well we have the seal and we
 
00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
also have the lettering that says um uh
 
00:38:59.430 --> 00:38:59.440 align:start position:0%
seal of the state of New Hampshire so
 
00:39:02.069 --> 00:39:02.079 align:start position:0%
words defeat the purpose a flag is a
 
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
graphic symbol lettering is hard to read
 
00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
from a distance I mean you certainly
 
00:39:08.309 --> 00:39:08.319 align:start position:0%
can't read the lettering on our flag
 
00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
unless you're right up against the flag
 
00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:12.760 align:start position:0%
seals are designed to be read at close
 
00:39:15.829 --> 00:39:15.839 align:start position:0%
range so enough said for this flag and
 
00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:19.160 align:start position:0%
finally be distinctive or be related
 
00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:21.560 align:start position:0%
avoid duplicating other flags but use
 
00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
similari to show connections well we
 
00:39:26.349 --> 00:39:26.359 align:start position:0%
don't duplicate other flags but the
 
00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
state seal on a blue bed sheet design is
 
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
the opposite of
 
00:39:34.589 --> 00:39:34.599 align:start position:0%
distinctive um on the very last page of
 
00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
the handout I have uh at the bottom
 
00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
YouTube does your flag fail so I
 
00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
encourage you go to YouTube Type in
 
00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
those words does your flag fail and
 
00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:44.920 align:start position:0%
it'll take you to about an 18-minute
 
00:39:48.309 --> 00:39:48.319 align:start position:0%
very entertaining video about state
 
00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:52.079 align:start position:0%
flags and um showing that ours is among
 
00:39:54.990 --> 00:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
those that get a failing
 
00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:57.839 align:start position:0%
grade so this
 
00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
Bill establishes a commission to study
 
00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire flag it's got three
 
00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:06.640 align:start position:0%
house members one Senator and unlike any
 
00:40:08.430 --> 00:40:08.440 align:start position:0%
other flag bill that I've seen and I had
 
00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
OS do research for me this one has two
 
00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:13.720 align:start position:0%
other people it has the president of the
 
00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:15.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Historical Society or
 
00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
their designate and the head of the New
 
00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
England vexillological Association or
 
00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:22.630 align:start position:0%
England vexillological Association or
their

00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
designate no previous FL uh flag Bill
 
00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:28.520 align:start position:0%
had anybody from either the Historical
 
00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
Society or a vexal
 
00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
vexillologist I can't say it this
 
00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
commission would be unique it would
 
00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
review the history of the flag it would
 
00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
examine the vexillological principles
 
00:40:42.349 --> 00:40:42.359 align:start position:0%
and it would recommend whether to
 
00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
redesign the flag and if so a process to
 
00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
create the proposed design the
 
00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:49.960 align:start position:0%
commission may propose its own design
 
00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
but it's not required to do so it may
 
00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
recommend an implementation schedule for
 
00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
the design now there's one thing that I
 
00:40:58.829 --> 00:40:58.839 align:start position:0%
intend to have in the bill but uh
 
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
apparently OS dropped it but I'd like it
 
00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
to to be in there at some point which is
 
00:41:06.349 --> 00:41:06.359 align:start position:0%
that I I don't want this to cost the
 
00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
state money I mean we have a lot of
 
00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:11.000 align:start position:0%
flags that the state owns and if we were
 
00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:13.160 align:start position:0%
to change the flag design that would be
 
00:41:15.589 --> 00:41:15.599 align:start position:0%
a lot of new flags that we'd have to buy
 
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
so what I'd recommend would be that uh
 
00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
and what I wanted in the bill was that
 
00:41:23.829 --> 00:41:23.839 align:start position:0%
if the flag design does change new Flags
 
00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
would be the new design old Flags would
 
00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
not have to be
 
00:41:30.589 --> 00:41:30.599 align:start position:0%
replaced until they actually wore out so
 
00:41:32.589 --> 00:41:32.599 align:start position:0%
that there would be no additional cost
 
00:41:34.109 --> 00:41:34.119 align:start position:0%
it would just be when we buy new Flags
 
00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:37.480 align:start position:0%
we buy the new flag so that's the bill
 
00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:39.800 align:start position:0%
um I know that we've seen a lot of flag
 
00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:41.640 align:start position:0%
bills over the years I know we had one
 
00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:43.480 align:start position:0%
last year I remember testifying against
 
00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:45.160 align:start position:0%
it because what it did was it added
 
00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
lettering to the flag and I know uh that
 
00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear a flag bill this
 
00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh I just think that this is
 
00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:54.200 align:start position:0%
the process to go through to actually
 
00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:56.680 align:start position:0%
have a commission with informed people
 
00:42:00.670 --> 00:42:00.680 align:start position:0%
on it to decide what we might want to do
 
00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:04.200 align:start position:0%
with our non-unique state flag and with
 
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
that I'm happy to take
 
00:42:09.349 --> 00:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
questions represento thank you madam
 
00:42:10.589 --> 00:42:10.599 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative for
 
00:42:13.349 --> 00:42:13.359 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I visited Utah a
 
00:42:14.910 --> 00:42:14.920 align:start position:0%
couple of times I love their new state
 
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
flag it's great but um on on state
 
00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
buildings they still fly the old state
 
00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
flag as a symbol of their history um
 
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
would you support flying both state
 
00:42:27.870 --> 00:42:27.880 align:start position:0%
flags on state buildings or just the new
 
00:42:32.309 --> 00:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
one and with or with this commission
 
00:42:34.109 --> 00:42:34.119 align:start position:0%
would this be something where we would
 
00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
be required to adopt the um commission's
 
00:42:39.549 --> 00:42:39.559 align:start position:0%
report or would it be um up to the
 
00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:41.480 align:start position:0%
legislature to determine if it wants to
 
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
accept the results or not thank you uh
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
as far as flying two flags that's really
 
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
up to the state and and up to the
 
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
administration of the state what they'd
 
00:42:54.589 --> 00:42:54.599 align:start position:0%
want to do um and then uh I'm sorry what
 
00:42:57.349 --> 00:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
was the second question
 
00:42:59.309 --> 00:42:59.319 align:start position:0%
um would the legislature be required to
 
00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:02.440 align:start position:0%
adop right yes yeah um and I would
 
00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:04.520 align:start position:0%
expect that that this commission would
 
00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:07.400 align:start position:0%
recommend legislation which is typically
 
00:43:09.309 --> 00:43:09.319 align:start position:0%
what a commission or committee would do
 
00:43:12.829 --> 00:43:12.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
legislation yes and in fact as written
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
the commission would issue a report and
 
00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
if they did recommend a flag it would
 
00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:24.680 align:start position:0%
require future legislation which would
 
00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
include the transition language that's
 
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
necessary Neary to make sure we don't
 
00:43:32.069 --> 00:43:32.079 align:start position:0%
have to replace every single flag in in
 
00:43:34.270 --> 00:43:34.280 align:start position:0%
in the State
 
00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:36.200 align:start position:0%
representam uh thank you madam chair and
 
00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for bringing
 
00:43:40.069 --> 00:43:40.079 align:start position:0%
this to us uh looking at what you
 
00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:42.040 align:start position:0%
provided here it sounds like there'll be
 
00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
a committee looking at how to redesign
 
00:43:47.109 --> 00:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
the flag however on the last page of the
 
00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:49.240 align:start position:0%
document you gave us it said don't allow
 
00:43:51.549 --> 00:43:51.559 align:start position:0%
a committee to design a flag instead
 
00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:53.720 align:start position:0%
import power individuals to design flags
 
00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:56.240 align:start position:0%
and use a committee to select among them
 
00:43:58.430 --> 00:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious how I recognize that
 
00:43:59.510 --> 00:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
this is something that people have been
 
00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
working on for a long time and I'm just
 
00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
trying to understand how creating a
 
00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
commission solves that problem of not
 
00:44:07.069 --> 00:44:07.079 align:start position:0%
having a committee design the flag thank
 
00:44:09.109 --> 00:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
you uh so the bill says that the
 
00:44:12.069 --> 00:44:12.079 align:start position:0%
commission would recommend a process and
 
00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
the process might be hire an actual
 
00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:18.680 align:start position:0%
vexal I can't a person you know the
 
00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:21.720 align:start position:0%
vexillological person um to design the
 
00:44:25.069 --> 00:44:25.079 align:start position:0%
flag or it might say uh let's get uh a
 
00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:28.040 align:start position:0%
couple of people from the logical
 
00:44:30.549 --> 00:44:30.559 align:start position:0%
Association but the point is that the
 
00:44:33.069 --> 00:44:33.079 align:start position:0%
the commission would design a process
 
00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
which might include the commission
 
00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
not other
 
00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
questions thank you all right thank
 
00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:04.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair friends and
 
00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
colleagues on the House Executive
 
00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
Department's Administration committee I
 
00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
think representative Corman did a
 
00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:13.240 align:start position:0%
fantastic job as to why this study
 
00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
committee wouldn't be important I just
 
00:45:16.589 --> 00:45:16.599 align:start position:0%
would like to add my support to the
 
00:45:20.109 --> 00:45:20.119 align:start position:0%
study committee uh understanding the
 
00:45:21.790 --> 00:45:21.800 align:start position:0%
effort to get rid of study committees
 
00:45:24.349 --> 00:45:24.359 align:start position:0%
and commissions I think this is one that
 
00:45:26.309 --> 00:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
meets the standards that have been set
 
00:45:28.109 --> 00:45:28.119 align:start position:0%
by the people who are trying to get rid
 
00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:30.280 align:start position:0%
of those study commissions and committ
 
00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh committees and commissions that
 
00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:35.400 align:start position:0%
standard being interest in the committee
 
00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
and representatives showing that they
 
00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
would actually serve on the committee
 
00:45:41.349 --> 00:45:41.359 align:start position:0%
and want to do this work diligently I
 
00:45:42.549 --> 00:45:42.559 align:start position:0%
know for a fact that there are
 
00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:43.960 align:start position:0%
Representatives would want to serve on
 
00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
this committee and do that work uh which
 
00:45:48.510 --> 00:45:48.520 align:start position:0%
to me means that this is a good enough
 
00:45:50.589 --> 00:45:50.599 align:start position:0%
committee to want to approve and as
 
00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
representative Corman
 
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
outlaid our flag is not unique it's a
 
00:45:57.950 --> 00:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
very un unique flag flag and for such a
 
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
unique State you'd think we'd want a
 
00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:03.720 align:start position:0%
distinct flag that shows our character
 
00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:05.720 align:start position:0%
respects our Traditions to your point
 
00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
representative tibio you know maybe it'd
 
00:46:10.309 --> 00:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
be good to have the flag flying but I
 
00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:12.079 align:start position:0%
don't think there's many people in New
 
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who view the flag as a
 
00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
connecting piece to our to our history I
 
00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
think in fact given the fact that the
 
00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:23.240 align:start position:0%
boat is built in M was built in Maine
 
00:46:25.309 --> 00:46:25.319 align:start position:0%
captured by the British and used against
 
00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:26.920 align:start position:0%
American soldiers during the revolution
 
00:46:29.829 --> 00:46:29.839 align:start position:0%
ution it's actually kind of a a bit of a
 
00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
spitting on on New Hampshire tradition
 
00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
and history when there are so many other
 
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:36.640 align:start position:0%
stories of people like General John
 
00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:39.400 align:start position:0%
Stark and Daniel Webster I know you had
 
00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:42.520 align:start position:0%
legislation earlier today to honor him
 
00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:44.720 align:start position:0%
that would be so much more significant
 
00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
to have on our flag and represent as the
 
00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:48.280 align:start position:0%
history and tradition of the State of
 
00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:49.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I think the
 
00:46:51.309 --> 00:46:51.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity that we have here with this
 
00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:55.480 align:start position:0%
commission is to create a new flag not
 
00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
by designed by the commission as
 
00:46:58.349 --> 00:46:58.359 align:start position:0%
representative Corman said but to open
 
00:46:59.910 --> 00:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
up the process by which that design
 
00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
would happen so that maybe a design
 
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
which connects to our history and makes
 
00:47:06.589 --> 00:47:06.599 align:start position:0%
people want to look into it a little bit
 
00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
more comes about so I'm just here to
 
00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:15.640 align:start position:0%
support Vex olical standards and thank
 
00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
representative Corman for bringing this
 
00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:19.960 align:start position:0%
bill forward and I hope you know it's
 
00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
changing the flag shouldn't be the
 
00:47:23.109 --> 00:47:23.119 align:start position:0%
legislator's priority but being a
 
00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
legislator means that you can focus on a
 
00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:27.400 align:start position:0%
million and one different things at the
 
00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
same time okay and I think that this is
 
00:47:31.309 --> 00:47:31.319 align:start position:0%
one of those things where you know it
 
00:47:33.630 --> 00:47:33.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be our Focus but it can
 
00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
be something that we can start to move
 
00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:38.720 align:start position:0%
the ball forward on because our flag is
 
00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:41.880 align:start position:0%
not unique and uh the
 
00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
blue tarp that it is is just not
 
00:47:47.109 --> 00:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
respectful I think of the distinct
 
00:47:49.470 --> 00:47:49.480 align:start position:0%
nature of the State of New Hampshire so
 
00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:50.920 align:start position:0%
with that thank you very much Madam
 
00:47:54.069 --> 00:47:54.079 align:start position:0%
chair I I wouldn't expect there to be
 
00:47:56.309 --> 00:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
questions questions yes thank you
 
00:47:56.319 --> 00:47:58.150 align:start position:0%
questions questions yes thank you
representative

00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:47:59.430 --> 00:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler and I apologize
 
00:48:02.910 --> 00:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
to representative Corman I probably
 
00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:05.000 align:start position:0%
should have asked this question of you
 
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
um but it there's a common saying about
 
00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:09.400 align:start position:0%
um a camel is a horse designed by
 
00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
committee I think that I agree with
 
00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
representative Leon of regarding the
 
00:48:17.829 --> 00:48:17.839 align:start position:0%
power of this commission uh to
 
00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
design a state flag um on lines 25 and
 
00:48:24.510 --> 00:48:24.520 align:start position:0%
26 it says the commission shall have the
 
00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
ability to propose one or more of its
 
00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
own designs but is not required to do so
 
00:48:31.109 --> 00:48:31.119 align:start position:0%
um would you and the prime sponsor be
 
00:48:32.549 --> 00:48:32.559 align:start position:0%
open given that there may be an
 
00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
amendment coming uh to removing that
 
00:48:37.109 --> 00:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
piece of it so that we don't get a
 
00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
design coming out of this committee but
 
00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
only a recommendation regarding process
 
00:48:42.990 --> 00:48:43.000 align:start position:0%
I think it's thank you I thank you
 
00:48:46.309 --> 00:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
representative D um you know study
 
00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
committees and their their charges I
 
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
have other study committee legislation
 
00:48:52.510 --> 00:48:52.520 align:start position:0%
around school start times and uh we are
 
00:48:54.910 --> 00:48:54.920 align:start position:0%
going back and forth about the exact
 
00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
language around the charge of the
 
00:48:57.589 --> 00:48:57.599 align:start position:0%
committee I I always find it a little
 
00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:00.280 align:start position:0%
bit funny if the committee determines
 
00:49:02.829 --> 00:49:02.839 align:start position:0%
that the language in 25 and 26 is such
 
00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
that uh it would prompt the committee to
 
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
create a design it's not how I read it
 
00:49:09.390 --> 00:49:09.400 align:start position:0%
but if that's how the committee views it
 
00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
then I would be fine with removing that
 
00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:13.880 align:start position:0%
language and making explicitly the
 
00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
committee's duty to have it be such that
 
00:49:18.309 --> 00:49:18.319 align:start position:0%
they create the process by which we
 
00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
design the flag thank you thank you are
 
00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:23.640 align:start position:0%
there any other questions representative
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam chairman so so
 
00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
do you think representative that the
 
00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:31.640 align:start position:0%
average citizen of New Hampshire has any
 
00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
idea how how boring and uh
 
00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
and typical our flag is of bad flag
 
00:49:43.470 --> 00:49:43.480 align:start position:0%
design that in other words we see we
 
00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:46.040 align:start position:0%
know our own flag but we don't know
 
00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
other flags so we don't
 
00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
realize how much it is a bad design
 
00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt i' would say I
 
00:49:55.950 --> 00:49:55.960 align:start position:0%
think they do the people who have come
 
00:49:58.109 --> 00:49:58.119 align:start position:0%
up to me and said I heard that you're on
 
00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
legislation to change the state flag
 
00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
they've been very excited about it
 
00:50:03.829 --> 00:50:03.839 align:start position:0%
because they see the flag as
 
00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:05.960 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily boring and they've heard
 
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
the stories of what's happened in Utah
 
00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
and Minnesota how states are moving
 
00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
forward to change this flag and uh yeah
 
00:50:16.549 --> 00:50:16.559 align:start position:0%
people as far as I've seen as far as my
 
00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
personal anecdote can relay have been
 
00:50:22.270 --> 00:50:22.280 align:start position:0%
very uh excited about the prospect that
 
00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
we'd get a flag that respects the
 
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
traditions of the State of New Hampshire
 
00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:27.400 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:28.910 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
anyone

00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
else thank you representative we thank
 
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
you madam
 
00:50:44.789 --> 00:50:44.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:48.750 --> 00:50:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:52.870 align:start position:0%
 
morning

00:50:52.870 --> 00:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:57.349 --> 00:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
the hello I
 
00:50:59.870 --> 00:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
I think that the state flag should be
 
00:51:02.829 --> 00:51:02.839 align:start position:0%
changed and I have a bill which is
 
00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
actually going to be heard later today
 
00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
on that same subject but I don't think
 
00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:09.240 align:start position:0%
there should be a
 
00:51:11.950 --> 00:51:11.960 align:start position:0%
commission uh in Massachusetts there was
 
00:51:14.190 --> 00:51:14.200 align:start position:0%
a commission to change the state flag
 
00:51:16.109 --> 00:51:16.119 align:start position:0%
the first time it failed to come up with
 
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
a design and then the commission had to
 
00:51:24.549 --> 00:51:24.559 align:start position:0%
ask for another extension and another
 
00:51:24.559 --> 00:51:26.870 align:start position:0%
ask for another extension and another
$100,000

00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
$100,000
 
00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
and now in
 
00:51:31.710 --> 00:51:31.720 align:start position:0%
2024 they got another
 
00:51:35.309 --> 00:51:35.319 align:start position:0%
$100,000 to restart the commission
 
00:51:38.349 --> 00:51:38.359 align:start position:0%
because it ended up even after the
 
00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
extension not coming up with a design
 
00:51:44.190 --> 00:51:44.200 align:start position:0%
and now it's getting another
 
00:51:48.109 --> 00:51:48.119 align:start position:0%
100,000 for a new commission to come up
 
00:51:52.349 --> 00:51:52.359 align:start position:0%
with a design again and I also think
 
00:51:57.470 --> 00:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
that um New Hampshire has 138 statutory
 
00:51:59.950 --> 00:51:59.960 align:start position:0%
commissions we even have a committee to
 
00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
get rid of commissions and uh last
 
00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
session one of my sponsors was vice
 
00:52:08.069 --> 00:52:08.079 align:start position:0%
chair of that committee so I think I
 
00:52:09.829 --> 00:52:09.839 align:start position:0%
support changing the state flag I just
 
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
don't think we need a committee to do
 
00:52:15.069 --> 00:52:15.079 align:start position:0%
that thank you very much I happen to
 
00:52:18.349 --> 00:52:18.359 align:start position:0%
agree with you other uh questions
 
00:52:20.309 --> 00:52:20.319 align:start position:0%
comments represent yeah I have a
 
00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:22.200 align:start position:0%

public

00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:19.030 align:start position:0%

00:53:24.349 --> 00:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
Fellers yeah Madam chair if you're

asking about this bill here going to
 
00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:30.160 align:start position:0%
exective session I would hold off for
 
00:53:33.349 --> 00:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
right now I think there's I like to
 
00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
discuss it more internally
 
00:53:37.710 --> 00:53:37.720 align:start position:0%
and okay well
 
00:53:40.789 --> 00:53:40.799 align:start position:0%
that's fine we don't like to execute
 
00:53:43.069 --> 00:53:43.079 align:start position:0%
unless it's obvious and it seems like it
 
00:53:46.030 --> 00:53:46.040 align:start position:0%
isn't all right in that case we have uh
 
00:53:54.109 --> 00:53:54.119 align:start position:0%

01:09:15.149 --> 01:09:15.159 align:start position:0%
it it's not the years it's the
 
01:09:18.669 --> 01:09:18.679 align:start position:0%
mileage got a lot of tough miles here
 
01:09:18.679 --> 01:09:20.910 align:start position:0%
mileage got a lot of tough miles here
okay

01:09:20.910 --> 01:09:20.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:09:23.709 --> 01:09:23.719 align:start position:0%
so this is
 
01:09:26.030 --> 01:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
the house build
 
01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
52 the prime sponsor representative Reed
 
01:09:30.229 --> 01:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
will be here very
 
01:09:33.550 --> 01:09:33.560 align:start position:0%
shortly this bill clarifies the effect
 
01:09:36.829 --> 01:09:36.839 align:start position:0%
of designated A Day a legal holiday and
 
01:09:40.709 --> 01:09:40.719 align:start position:0%
make the days on which the state primary
 
01:09:45.669 --> 01:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:48.430 --> 01:09:48.440 align:start position:0%
quadral no I'm I'm just actually reading
 
01:09:50.189 --> 01:09:50.199 align:start position:0%
the analysis for the
 
01:09:52.229 --> 01:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
committee thank you representative
 
01:09:53.709 --> 01:09:53.719 align:start position:0%

committee's behalf

representative
 
01:10:01.630 --> 01:10:01.640 align:start position:0%
Reed sorry we started a bit
 
01:10:04.470 --> 01:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
late thank you madam chair and thank you
 
01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee um
 
01:10:09.070 --> 01:10:09.080 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Ellen Reed I
 
01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
represent Rockingham 10 which is New
 
01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
Market and
 
01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
newfields HB 52 although it says an act
 
01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
relative to legal holidays is um
 
01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
actually election day holiday it's
 
01:10:23.830 --> 01:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
election day holiday bill um I will get
 
01:10:25.990 --> 01:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
into the mechanics of why why it's
 
01:10:29.430 --> 01:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
worded what how it is worded um which
 
01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
kind of was a an interesting process to
 
01:10:35.350 --> 01:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
get there but um I will start with why
 
01:10:37.630 --> 01:10:37.640 align:start position:0%
our elections are held on Tuesday when
 
01:10:39.430 --> 01:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
that federal law was passed and the
 
01:10:43.510 --> 01:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
federal um Congress has dictated the day
 
01:10:46.510 --> 01:10:46.520 align:start position:0%
of our federal elections obviously um we
 
01:10:48.830 --> 01:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
were a very agrarian society we didn't
 
01:10:51.669 --> 01:10:51.679 align:start position:0%
have most people working N9 to five jobs
 
01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
and uh most people went to church and so
 
01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
Tuesday was considered to be
 
01:10:58.149 --> 01:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
the most convenient day because people
 
01:10:59.590 --> 01:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
would go to church on Sunday they'd have
 
01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
a day of travel and then could uh vote
 
01:11:04.870 --> 01:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
they'd have to travel to their voting
 
01:11:07.550 --> 01:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
location they would vote on Tuesday so
 
01:11:09.470 --> 01:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
it's been Tuesday for a very long time
 
01:11:11.709 --> 01:11:11.719 align:start position:0%
and now Tuesday is very inconvenient for
 
01:11:16.430 --> 01:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
most of um society and
 
01:11:20.350 --> 01:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
um the the obvious advantage to having
 
01:11:22.830 --> 01:11:22.840 align:start position:0%
an election day holiday is isn't this
 
01:11:24.709 --> 01:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
great a lot of workers would be able
 
01:11:28.590 --> 01:11:28.600 align:start position:0%
more able to go to the polling places um
 
01:11:30.430 --> 01:11:30.440 align:start position:0%
and I'm imagining bringing their
 
01:11:33.830 --> 01:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
children and and the whole bit but I
 
01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
want to talk a lot more about the
 
01:11:38.750 --> 01:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
cultural advantage of having an election
 
01:11:40.629 --> 01:11:40.639 align:start position:0%
day holiday because it's not just the
 
01:11:43.149 --> 01:11:43.159 align:start position:0%
logistics around increased availability
 
01:11:46.350 --> 01:11:46.360 align:start position:0%
after all this would only apply to uh
 
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
government employees we can't mandate
 
01:11:51.149 --> 01:11:51.159 align:start position:0%
that any uh business shuts down on
 
01:11:53.950 --> 01:11:53.960 align:start position:0%
Election Day this certainly doesn't uh
 
01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
claim to do that and most people work in
 
01:11:56.830 --> 01:11:56.840 align:start position:0%
the private
 
01:11:59.430 --> 01:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
sector um some businesses tend to follow
 
01:12:01.830 --> 01:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
suit with state holidays but certainly
 
01:12:05.070 --> 01:12:05.080 align:start position:0%
not everybody um it does there is the
 
01:12:08.149 --> 01:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
last part of the bill that allows uh
 
01:12:10.510 --> 01:12:10.520 align:start position:0%
employees of the private sector up to
 
01:12:13.229 --> 01:12:13.239 align:start position:0%
three hours unpaid to go vote if they
 
01:12:16.270 --> 01:12:16.280 align:start position:0%
are scheduled to work during polling
 
01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
hours but the cultural importance of
 
01:12:20.310 --> 01:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
having a
 
01:12:23.430 --> 01:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
holiday that raises awareness and
 
01:12:25.510 --> 01:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
celebrates the idea that we are a
 
01:12:27.149 --> 01:12:27.159 align:start position:0%
democracy and let me just pause there
 
01:12:29.110 --> 01:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
because I know that sometimes there's
 
01:12:31.709 --> 01:12:31.719 align:start position:0%
controversy around the word democracy I
 
01:12:33.790 --> 01:12:33.800 align:start position:0%
did teach American government at the
 
01:12:36.750 --> 01:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
college level for a number of years um
 
01:12:38.110 --> 01:12:38.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's confusion around the
 
01:12:40.709 --> 01:12:40.719 align:start position:0%
word democracy versus republic Republic
 
01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
is a flavor of democracy so we are a
 
01:12:45.590 --> 01:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
democracy we are a rule by the people
 
01:12:48.270 --> 01:12:48.280 align:start position:0%
democracy um there are two basic flavors
 
01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
of democracy direct democracy which is
 
01:12:52.510 --> 01:12:52.520 align:start position:0%
basically practiced in no government
 
01:12:55.229 --> 01:12:55.239 align:start position:0%
anywhere because it's too um unwieldy
 
01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
and a direct or a representative
 
01:12:59.629 --> 01:12:59.639 align:start position:0%
democracy where we elect people which is
 
01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
also known as a republic so when I say
 
01:13:02.830 --> 01:13:02.840 align:start position:0%
democracy please understand that I'm
 
01:13:04.110 --> 01:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
talking about our
 
01:13:07.470 --> 01:13:07.480 align:start position:0%
Republic the cultural value of having a
 
01:13:10.669 --> 01:13:10.679 align:start position:0%
day off to celebrate the fact that we
 
01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:13.480 align:start position:0%
were an experiment in
 
01:13:15.750 --> 01:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
democracy that we that was our whole
 
01:13:18.229 --> 01:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
founding principle that we were getting
 
01:13:20.070 --> 01:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
rid of kings and we were turning the
 
01:13:21.910 --> 01:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
power over to the people the cultural
 
01:13:25.470 --> 01:13:25.480 align:start position:0%
significance of that cannot be um
 
01:13:29.350 --> 01:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
overstated we have a day off to
 
01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
celebrate people who have fought for
 
01:13:34.750 --> 01:13:34.760 align:start position:0%
this country for our democracy we have
 
01:13:36.270 --> 01:13:36.280 align:start position:0%
another day off to celebrate people who
 
01:13:39.709 --> 01:13:39.719 align:start position:0%
fought and then died for this country we
 
01:13:43.270 --> 01:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
have a day off celebrating presidents of
 
01:13:46.030 --> 01:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
this country and their birthdays and of
 
01:13:50.669 --> 01:13:50.679 align:start position:0%
course we have a huge day off for the um
 
01:13:52.870 --> 01:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
annual celebration of the birth of our
 
01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
independence as a democracy
 
01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
um these are things that we put on the
 
01:13:58.870 --> 01:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
calendar we know we're coming we are
 
01:14:00.669 --> 01:14:00.679 align:start position:0%
planning barbecues we're planning
 
01:14:03.990 --> 01:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
fireworks we're planning events and
 
01:14:06.189 --> 01:14:06.199 align:start position:0%
those ideas of those days whether it's
 
01:14:08.229 --> 01:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
Memorial Day or fourth of July those
 
01:14:10.590 --> 01:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
concepts are in our minds as we are
 
01:14:12.910 --> 01:14:12.920 align:start position:0%
looking forward to that day off
 
01:14:15.669 --> 01:14:15.679 align:start position:0%
together why are we celebrating all the
 
01:14:17.149 --> 01:14:17.159 align:start position:0%
people who fought and died and served
 
01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
for our democracy and not celebrating
 
01:14:22.110 --> 01:14:22.120 align:start position:0%
the actual day we do the actual thing
 
01:14:24.590 --> 01:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
that they fought and died and served for
 
01:14:27.950 --> 01:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
I don't understand that but there is one
 
01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
part of our vast country that does
 
01:14:32.629 --> 01:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
actually have an actual in practice
 
01:14:34.350 --> 01:14:34.360 align:start position:0%
election day holiday and that is Puerto
 
01:14:38.110 --> 01:14:38.120 align:start position:0%
Rico Puerto Rico has the day off and
 
01:14:40.830 --> 01:14:40.840 align:start position:0%
it's not just a you know we have time
 
01:14:42.510 --> 01:14:42.520 align:start position:0%
off of work isn't this great we get to
 
01:14:45.669 --> 01:14:45.679 align:start position:0%
go do this thing now they have parades
 
01:14:48.470 --> 01:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
that they call caravanas it's a huge
 
01:14:53.950 --> 01:14:53.960 align:start position:0%
cultural tradition steeped day of mock
 
01:14:56.629 --> 01:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
debates or debates and mock elections
 
01:14:59.870 --> 01:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
and just really celebrating the idea of
 
01:15:02.830 --> 01:15:02.840 align:start position:0%
self-governance Puerto Rico's turnout is
 
01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
in the high
 
01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
90s we are no slouches in New Hampshire
 
01:15:10.149 --> 01:15:10.159 align:start position:0%
we're third among states we're not
 
01:15:14.070 --> 01:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
90 we're not close here's the one very
 
01:15:16.189 --> 01:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
very interesting piece of that so they
 
01:15:17.550 --> 01:15:17.560 align:start position:0%
you Puerto Ricans grow up in this
 
01:15:18.830 --> 01:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
culture where they're celebrating this
 
01:15:20.669 --> 01:15:20.679 align:start position:0%
and they have the day off when Puerto
 
01:15:23.390 --> 01:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
Ricans move to the mainland same
 
01:15:25.590 --> 01:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
country just a different
 
01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
culture with
 
01:15:30.229 --> 01:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
no day to celebrate that day their voter
 
01:15:32.350 --> 01:15:32.360 align:start position:0%
turnout goes down to the 60% with the
 
01:15:36.070 --> 01:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
average of the mainlanders so I'm not
 
01:15:37.750 --> 01:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
content to be third in the nation for
 
01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
turnout I believe in the principles of a
 
01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
robust Republic where everyone gets a
 
01:15:46.669 --> 01:15:46.679 align:start position:0%
voice and I think we all bemoan the fact
 
01:15:48.510 --> 01:15:48.520 align:start position:0%
that our very own constituents don't
 
01:15:51.310 --> 01:15:51.320 align:start position:0%
know who we are don't understand Civics
 
01:15:52.990 --> 01:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
don't understand the principles of of
 
01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
government and have kind of turn
 
01:15:56.830 --> 01:15:56.840 align:start position:0%
themselves off and I think celebrating
 
01:15:59.470 --> 01:15:59.480 align:start position:0%
that day is not just a logistical win
 
01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:01.400 align:start position:0%
for people to be able to turn out but
 
01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
it's a cultural win for people to be
 
01:16:06.629 --> 01:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
re-engaged with their government so just
 
01:16:09.270 --> 01:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
very briefly the mechanics when I said
 
01:16:10.750 --> 01:16:10.760 align:start position:0%
uh originally eight years ago I would
 
01:16:12.390 --> 01:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
like to add election day as a holiday
 
01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
turns out election day is already listed
 
01:16:15.990 --> 01:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
as our holiday we have a list of state
 
01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
holidays we have no definition for what
 
01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:19.270 align:start position:0%
holidays we have no definition for what
that

01:16:19.270 --> 01:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:16:22.669 --> 01:16:22.679 align:start position:0%
means and I I set about with research
 
01:16:23.870 --> 01:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
saying okay so what does it mean that we
 
01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
have a list of state holidays because it
 
01:16:26.830 --> 01:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't say what we do on state holidays
 
01:16:28.070 --> 01:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
and it turns out election day is
 
01:16:30.110 --> 01:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
basically in this list the only day that
 
01:16:32.870 --> 01:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
we do not have a in practice legal
 
01:16:34.669 --> 01:16:34.679 align:start position:0%
holiday so it's in the list of state
 
01:16:35.950 --> 01:16:35.960 align:start position:0%
holidays but it's the only one in the
 
01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
list where we don't have an actual legal
 
01:16:39.270 --> 01:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
holiday for
 
01:16:42.870 --> 01:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
it so I went about defining what we do
 
01:16:44.709 --> 01:16:44.719 align:start position:0%
for all the other holidays and basically
 
01:16:47.669 --> 01:16:47.679 align:start position:0%
it says if it's not and I hate to use
 
01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
the word essential but essential
 
01:16:51.910 --> 01:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
Services um that those people have the
 
01:16:55.310 --> 01:16:55.320 align:start position:0%
day off and what we're talking about um
 
01:16:58.110 --> 01:16:58.120 align:start position:0%
in terms of logistics is essentially a
 
01:17:00.910 --> 01:17:00.920 align:start position:0%
snow day and I think our Republic is
 
01:17:04.590 --> 01:17:04.600 align:start position:0%
worth a snow day I did include primary
 
01:17:07.390 --> 01:17:07.400 align:start position:0%
so because if it was just election day
 
01:17:09.070 --> 01:17:09.080 align:start position:0%
just the general election it would be
 
01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
once every two years if you include
 
01:17:12.229 --> 01:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
primary it's two days every two years so
 
01:17:15.390 --> 01:17:15.400 align:start position:0%
it averages out to yearly um and
 
01:17:18.470 --> 01:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
primaries are often where the real uh
 
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
democracy is is acted and um I included
 
01:17:25.030 --> 01:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
primaries to find what holidays were and
 
01:17:29.149 --> 01:17:29.159 align:start position:0%
and um said that collective bargaining
 
01:17:30.910 --> 01:17:30.920 align:start position:0%
for state employees could or for any
 
01:17:32.950 --> 01:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
government employees could uh rearrange
 
01:17:35.709 --> 01:17:35.719 align:start position:0%
different days and uh allowed up to
 
01:17:38.470 --> 01:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
three hours unpaid for private sector
 
01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
employees to go vote and that's the bill
 
01:17:42.270 --> 01:17:42.280 align:start position:0%
that's the structure and I'm happy to
 
01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:44.590 align:start position:0%
that's the structure and I'm happy to
take

01:17:44.590 --> 01:17:44.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:46.750 --> 01:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
 
01:17:49.310 --> 01:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you for taking my question
 
01:17:52.750 --> 01:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
uh so just for clarity uh section one
 
01:17:55.189 --> 01:17:55.199 align:start position:0%
here where there's the actual embolden
 
01:17:59.149 --> 01:17:59.159 align:start position:0%
language that does not actually affect
 
01:18:02.189 --> 01:18:02.199 align:start position:0%
whether or not uh there's a day off
 
01:18:06.110 --> 01:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
correct right section one is um
 
01:18:08.510 --> 01:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
essentially adding the primaries uh
 
01:18:10.270 --> 01:18:10.280 align:start position:0%
section one is adding the primaries to
 
01:18:12.550 --> 01:18:12.560 align:start position:0%
that currently existing list of state
 
01:18:15.310 --> 01:18:15.320 align:start position:0%
holidays which we do not have
 
01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
any definition of what we do on a state
 
01:18:20.709 --> 01:18:20.719 align:start position:0%
holiday it's just here's a list it's
 
01:18:23.629 --> 01:18:23.639 align:start position:0%
it's it's um it's a t it's an honorary
 
01:18:26.510 --> 01:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
title really to have a state holiday um
 
01:18:28.910 --> 01:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
and then section uh the new section
 
01:18:31.070 --> 01:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
section two is then going back and
 
01:18:32.590 --> 01:18:32.600 align:start position:0%
defining what those state holidays
 
01:18:36.110 --> 01:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
actually do okay thank
 
01:18:38.870 --> 01:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
you all right representative
 
01:18:40.629 --> 01:18:40.639 align:start position:0%
Bailey thank
 
01:18:44.149 --> 01:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
you doesn't this tend to favor those who
 
01:18:46.709 --> 01:18:46.719 align:start position:0%
belong to parties in the primary
 
01:18:49.270 --> 01:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
elections like something like 40 45% of
 
01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:50.590 align:start position:0%
elections like something like 40 45% of
the

01:18:50.590 --> 01:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:18:53.470 --> 01:18:53.480 align:start position:0%
population does not belong to a party
 
01:18:56.870 --> 01:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah and because so for full
 
01:18:59.750 --> 01:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
disclosure before I ver ran for office I
 
01:19:02.350 --> 01:19:02.360 align:start position:0%
was an Undeclared and a co-founder of
 
01:19:05.870 --> 01:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire independent voters um and
 
01:19:08.669 --> 01:19:08.679 align:start position:0%
while in office I somewhat notoriously
 
01:19:13.830 --> 01:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
went independent so um I the interests
 
01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
of independent voters is something very
 
01:19:17.830 --> 01:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
near and dear to me I don't believe in
 
01:19:20.950 --> 01:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
our two-party system for personal um
 
01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
disclosure I because famous ly um
 
01:19:30.709 --> 01:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
boss what was his name Boss Tweed said
 
01:19:32.750 --> 01:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
that I don't care who gets to vote as
 
01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
long as I pick the
 
01:19:36.669 --> 01:19:36.679 align:start position:0%
candidates because if you're forced to
 
01:19:36.679 --> 01:19:38.189 align:start position:0%
candidates because if you're forced to
choose

01:19:38.189 --> 01:19:38.199 align:start position:0%
choose
 
01:19:42.350 --> 01:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
between um hamburger in Salsbury
 
01:19:45.189 --> 01:19:45.199 align:start position:0%
stake you don't have much of a
 
01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
selection and so really a lot of I I
 
01:19:49.870 --> 01:19:49.880 align:start position:0%
briefly mentioned this but a lot of the
 
01:19:52.229 --> 01:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
real democracy or Republic go it happens
 
01:19:54.229 --> 01:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
in the primary level it's unfortunate
 
01:19:56.870 --> 01:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
because as a state pay for private
 
01:19:59.910 --> 01:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
entities to operate their own primaries
 
01:20:02.870 --> 01:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
um when that's not actually you know
 
01:20:04.990 --> 01:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
something it's it's we're paying for a
 
01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
private institution however the reason
 
01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
we do that is because it's so essential
 
01:20:12.030 --> 01:20:12.040 align:start position:0%
to our
 
01:20:14.590 --> 01:20:14.600 align:start position:0%
democracy primaries who is actually
 
01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
going to be on the ballot is so
 
01:20:17.189 --> 01:20:17.199 align:start position:0%
essential to our democracy that it's
 
01:20:20.430 --> 01:20:20.440 align:start position:0%
worth us investing in um also famously
 
01:20:22.990 --> 01:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
or infamously Texas back in the days of
 
01:20:25.790 --> 01:20:25.800 align:start position:0%
Jim Crow when much of the South had poll
 
01:20:28.830 --> 01:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
taxes and tests to prevent black people
 
01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
from voting Texas didn't do that they
 
01:20:34.750 --> 01:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
just said that um black people could
 
01:20:36.070 --> 01:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
vote in the general election no problem
 
01:20:39.709 --> 01:20:39.719 align:start position:0%
no test no pull taxes um but only white
 
01:20:40.990 --> 01:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
people could vote in the
 
01:20:43.470 --> 01:20:43.480 align:start position:0%
primary you see how that's a problem so
 
01:20:45.310 --> 01:20:45.320 align:start position:0%
primaries are incredibly important I
 
01:20:47.870 --> 01:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
also with you bemoan the fact that the
 
01:20:50.709 --> 01:20:50.719 align:start position:0%
private parties are such a force in our
 
01:20:53.110 --> 01:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
current system I have other bills and
 
01:20:54.669 --> 01:20:54.679 align:start position:0%
other committees to deal with that is
 
01:20:57.189 --> 01:20:57.199 align:start position:0%
issue but in terms of election day and
 
01:20:58.590 --> 01:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
whether or not we should honor it as a
 
01:21:00.750 --> 01:21:00.760 align:start position:0%
holiday to get people out and active if
 
01:21:03.110 --> 01:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
you are a party member or UND declared
 
01:21:05.189 --> 01:21:05.199 align:start position:0%
as long as we don't switch your ability
 
01:21:07.870 --> 01:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
to to uh participate in the primary as
 
01:21:11.270 --> 01:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
an Undeclared voter um That's essential
 
01:21:13.510 --> 01:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
no matter who you are at currently you
 
01:21:14.990 --> 01:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
get to participate in the primary even
 
01:21:16.350 --> 01:21:16.360 align:start position:0%
if you're
 
01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
Undeclared thank you other questions
 
01:21:23.310 --> 01:21:23.320 align:start position:0%
representative Sellers and then the
 
01:21:26.229 --> 01:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
lay thank you than Madam chair how many
 
01:21:28.709 --> 01:21:28.719 align:start position:0%
employees would this
 
01:21:31.270 --> 01:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
affect so I don't have off the top of my
 
01:21:34.270 --> 01:21:34.280 align:start position:0%
head a number of state employees and in
 
01:21:35.830 --> 01:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
technically it would affect all
 
01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
employees that are scheduled to work on
 
01:21:40.590 --> 01:21:40.600 align:start position:0%
Election Day because it also gives time
 
01:21:42.310 --> 01:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
offer the private sector but in terms of
 
01:21:44.550 --> 01:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
just a holiday it affects all government
 
01:21:45.950 --> 01:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
employees in the
 
01:21:49.030 --> 01:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
state except of course the moderators
 
01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
Selectmen and supervisors of the
 
01:21:54.110 --> 01:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
checklist that are required to to work
 
01:21:56.790 --> 01:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
on the ction itself which is put into
 
01:21:59.590 --> 01:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
that um new section as well as essential
 
01:22:02.030 --> 01:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
services like police officers
 
01:22:04.590 --> 01:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
firefighters um all normal
 
01:22:06.709 --> 01:22:06.719 align:start position:0%
representative leam thank you madam
 
01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative for
 
01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
bringing this to us um I say that you
 
01:22:11.870 --> 01:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
say that it would be unpaid three hours
 
01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
off but I don't see that specified
 
01:22:16.189 --> 01:22:16.199 align:start position:0%
anywhere in that
 
01:22:20.030 --> 01:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
language was oh um a previous version of
 
01:22:22.830 --> 01:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
the bill did say uh unpaid but the
 
01:22:25.110 --> 01:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
lawyer the drafting uh
 
01:22:27.629 --> 01:22:27.639 align:start position:0%
attorney uh said that it wasn't because
 
01:22:29.270 --> 01:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
we're not specifying that it has to be
 
01:22:32.270 --> 01:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
paid it defaults to the employer doesn't
 
01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
have to pay thank

classic form of town meeting is a form
 
01:22:44.990 --> 01:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
of direct democracy oh that's right
 
01:22:46.830 --> 01:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for the correction I I was
 
01:22:49.149 --> 01:22:49.159 align:start position:0%

there's no national government in the
 
01:22:52.910 --> 01:22:52.920 align:start position:0%
world but you are absolutely right and
 
01:22:57.149 --> 01:22:57.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:00.350 --> 01:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:11.750 --> 01:23:11.760 align:start position:0%

01:23:35.790 --> 01:23:35.800 align:start position:0%
participating um this does make that
 
01:23:38.870 --> 01:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
designation um in the primary and the
 
01:23:41.669 --> 01:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
presidential primary um establishing
 
01:23:44.110 --> 01:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
legal holidays will make New Hampshire
 
01:23:46.590 --> 01:23:46.600 align:start position:0%
more accessible for the average voters
 
01:23:49.830 --> 01:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
especially working parents um busy young
 
01:23:51.990 --> 01:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
professionals I had a neighbor who
 
01:23:54.189 --> 01:23:54.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to vote in the primary and said
 
01:23:55.270 --> 01:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
to me me
 
01:23:58.110 --> 01:23:58.120 align:start position:0%
oh the primary was yesterday they had no
 
01:24:00.590 --> 01:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
idea the date of the primary and I think
 
01:24:03.270 --> 01:24:03.280 align:start position:0%
that whatever we can do to elevate
 
01:24:06.310 --> 01:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the date of Elections um is
 
01:24:10.470 --> 01:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
is important for us is in Civic life um
 
01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
roughly about 60% of average citizens
 
01:24:15.910 --> 01:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
show up to cast a ballot this is vastly
 
01:24:18.590 --> 01:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
different in primaries and I actually
 
01:24:20.990 --> 01:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
just pulled up the state primary from
 
01:24:23.310 --> 01:24:23.320 align:start position:0%
2024 um
 
01:24:25.910 --> 01:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
72,000 dependent voters Undeclared
 
01:24:29.350 --> 01:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
voters voted in the um last September
 
01:24:32.350 --> 01:24:32.360 align:start position:0%
primary um and uh Undeclared is the
 
01:24:35.350 --> 01:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
largest um representative body we have
 
01:24:37.870 --> 01:24:37.880 align:start position:0%
in the state um I do think it's
 
01:24:40.629 --> 01:24:40.639 align:start position:0%
important for us to to move the needle
 
01:24:43.070 --> 01:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
closer to additional participation in
 
01:24:45.109 --> 01:24:45.119 align:start position:0%
our democracy so that every voter's
 
01:24:48.109 --> 01:24:48.119 align:start position:0%
voice can be heard um making an election
 
01:24:50.109 --> 01:24:50.119 align:start position:0%
day is highly
 
01:24:52.709 --> 01:24:52.719 align:start position:0%
favorable on both sides of the aisle
 
01:24:57.070 --> 01:24:57.080 align:start position:0%
according to a poll done in 24 um 72% of
 
01:24:59.350 --> 01:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
Americans support making Election Day a
 
01:25:02.470 --> 01:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
national holiday and this was 68% of
 
01:25:06.270 --> 01:25:06.280 align:start position:0%
Republicans and 78% of democratic voters
 
01:25:08.149 --> 01:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
um everyone benefits when we take
 
01:25:12.430 --> 01:25:12.440 align:start position:0%
advantage of um making a more active
 
01:25:15.550 --> 01:25:15.560 align:start position:0%
role of participating in elections um it
 
01:25:19.189 --> 01:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
is clear that voters want um
 
01:25:21.510 --> 01:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
politics to be in place for casting
 
01:25:24.350 --> 01:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
their ballots to be less stressful this
 
01:25:26.270 --> 01:25:26.280 align:start position:0%
past election many stood in line
 
01:25:28.310 --> 01:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
especially in larger cities for a couple
 
01:25:31.709 --> 01:25:31.719 align:start position:0%
of hours um if you are newly registered
 
01:25:34.350 --> 01:25:34.360 align:start position:0%
I know that was the long line in my poll
 
01:25:36.470 --> 01:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
um this last polling place this last
 
01:25:40.350 --> 01:25:40.360 align:start position:0%
November um so I do think giving um
 
01:25:44.070 --> 01:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
people three hours off um is a
 
01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
good good Benchmark um I know the New
 
01:25:48.950 --> 01:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire businesses for social
 
01:25:51.870 --> 01:25:51.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility did do a campaign for
 
01:25:54.669 --> 01:25:54.679 align:start position:0%
their um members on time off on ction
 
01:25:57.550 --> 01:25:57.560 align:start position:0%
day for for voters to work um and for
 
01:25:59.270 --> 01:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
for these reasons I urge the committee
 
01:26:01.669 --> 01:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
to vote a to pass on House Bill 52 and
 
01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any
 
01:26:06.950 --> 01:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative Leon
 
01:26:08.229 --> 01:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair and thank you
 
01:26:09.669 --> 01:26:09.679 align:start position:0%
for being here to ask questions I
 
01:26:11.189 --> 01:26:11.199 align:start position:0%
perhaps should have also asked this of
 
01:26:13.629 --> 01:26:13.639 align:start position:0%
the sponsor but um I I didn't recognize
 
01:26:16.030 --> 01:26:16.040 align:start position:0%
the question previously um in New
 
01:26:17.910 --> 01:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have good turnout at the
 
01:26:19.709 --> 01:26:19.719 align:start position:0%
state elections but we have absolutely
 
01:26:22.270 --> 01:26:22.280 align:start position:0%
dismal turnout at the local election
 
01:26:24.750 --> 01:26:24.760 align:start position:0%
level where most of our property tax
 
01:26:27.070 --> 01:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
are assessed um I'm curious if you think
 
01:26:28.590 --> 01:26:28.600 align:start position:0%
that it would be equally important to
 
01:26:31.310 --> 01:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
drive turnout to those local elections
 
01:26:33.070 --> 01:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
as you would the state level given the
 
01:26:35.629 --> 01:26:35.639 align:start position:0%
difference in turnouts I would I would
 
01:26:37.189 --> 01:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
also love if the Secretary of State
 
01:26:38.790 --> 01:26:38.800 align:start position:0%
published a date of all the local
 
01:26:41.189 --> 01:26:41.199 align:start position:0%
elections and I would love if Municipal
 
01:26:42.870 --> 01:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
Town governments put the date of their
 
01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
local elections on their website because
 
01:26:46.910 --> 01:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
we've been going through town websites
 
01:26:48.510 --> 01:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
to try to find the dates of town meeting
 
01:26:50.910 --> 01:26:50.920 align:start position:0%
and it's hard to find that information
 
01:26:52.870 --> 01:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
and uh I was just talking to a voter in
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
Peterboro yesterday that was trying
 
01:26:55.510 --> 01:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
trying to get information on their
 
01:26:58.669 --> 01:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
school district elections and was
 
01:27:00.470 --> 01:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
struggling to try to find out who the
 
01:27:02.590 --> 01:27:02.600 align:start position:0%
candidates were 10 days after the filing
 
01:27:05.229 --> 01:27:05.239 align:start position:0%
period had ended for that so I think
 
01:27:08.430 --> 01:27:08.440 align:start position:0%
that we could as a society do a a very
 
01:27:11.390 --> 01:27:11.400 align:start position:0%
much better job of
 
01:27:13.669 --> 01:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
publicizing who's on the ballot the date
 
01:27:15.310 --> 01:27:15.320 align:start position:0%
of the election the times the polling
 
01:27:18.590 --> 01:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
places are El are um we we participated
 
01:27:20.870 --> 01:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
open democracy did a survey that we
 
01:27:22.270 --> 01:27:22.280 align:start position:0%
presented to the Secretary of State we
 
01:27:23.669 --> 01:27:23.679 align:start position:0%
found out that it's easier to register
 
01:27:23.679 --> 01:27:24.709 align:start position:0%
found out that it's easier to register
your

01:27:24.709 --> 01:27:24.719 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:27:26.950 --> 01:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
than to register to vote um by going to
 
01:27:28.790 --> 01:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
town websites because that information
 
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
is much more readily available than the
 
01:27:33.149 --> 01:27:33.159 align:start position:0%
information on registering to vote on
 
01:27:35.149 --> 01:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
Town websites so we yes we can do a
 
01:27:37.790 --> 01:27:37.800 align:start position:0%
better job thank you
 
01:27:39.910 --> 01:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
represento thank you Miss in for being
 
01:27:43.149 --> 01:27:43.159 align:start position:0%
here um I just had a question regarding
 
01:27:45.790 --> 01:27:45.800 align:start position:0%
um the dates of our um elections do you
 
01:27:49.350 --> 01:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
think that um the primary date also
 
01:27:51.709 --> 01:27:51.719 align:start position:0%
drives down turnout same with um local
 
01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
election dates I'm thinking back to our
 
01:27:56.430 --> 01:27:56.440 align:start position:0%
Franklin ele ctions um this last year
 
01:27:59.550 --> 01:27:59.560 align:start position:0%
having um the October local elections
 
01:28:01.709 --> 01:28:01.719 align:start position:0%
wedged right between the September and
 
01:28:03.790 --> 01:28:03.800 align:start position:0%
November elections and we only got very
 
01:28:06.350 --> 01:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
low turnout so do you think successive
 
01:28:09.149 --> 01:28:09.159 align:start position:0%
elections like that also stifle um
 
01:28:11.870 --> 01:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
people's ability to go out and
 
01:28:15.229 --> 01:28:15.239 align:start position:0%
vote um well I I think that publicizing
 
01:28:17.350 --> 01:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
the date and making sure that there's
 
01:28:19.550 --> 01:28:19.560 align:start position:0%
availability for people to to take time
 
01:28:22.070 --> 01:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
off to participate is is critically
 
01:28:27.189 --> 01:28:27.199 align:start position:0%
important um I I on personally on record
 
01:28:28.830 --> 01:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
I've been on record that the city of
 
01:28:30.310 --> 01:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
Franklin should move our October
 
01:28:32.629 --> 01:28:32.639 align:start position:0%
election date to November because like
 
01:28:35.470 --> 01:28:35.480 align:start position:0%
other municipalities we have have a city
 
01:28:38.310 --> 01:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
election in November um instead of
 
01:28:40.550 --> 01:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
having an annual September October
 
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
November election um it's a lot for our
 
01:28:46.070 --> 01:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
poll workers too uh I think also within
 
01:28:49.590 --> 01:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
this uh we used to not have a TR trouble
 
01:28:51.870 --> 01:28:51.880 align:start position:0%
recruiting pole workers but right now
 
01:28:55.070 --> 01:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
there are lots of shortages pole workers
 
01:28:57.470 --> 01:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
across the state too so I do think
 
01:28:59.350 --> 01:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
making an election day holiday would
 
01:29:00.910 --> 01:29:00.920 align:start position:0%
allow people who might be state
 
01:29:02.709 --> 01:29:02.719 align:start position:0%
employees who have the day off like I
 
01:29:04.750 --> 01:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
know my moderator has to take a vacation
 
01:29:06.950 --> 01:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
day to be the moderator as a state
 
01:29:09.550 --> 01:29:09.560 align:start position:0%
employee um but this might give them
 
01:29:11.590 --> 01:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
time off in order to not have to use a
 
01:29:15.709 --> 01:29:15.719 align:start position:0%
vacation day um to to administer
 
01:29:18.350 --> 01:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
elections which I think is is is a is
 
01:29:20.590 --> 01:29:20.600 align:start position:0%
more work than their full-time job um to
 
01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:22.400 align:start position:0%
be at the polls of the be the opening of
 
01:29:24.910 --> 01:29:24.920 align:start position:0%
the of the polling place and and do
 
01:29:28.030 --> 01:29:28.040 align:start position:0%
everything that you know I our our city
 
01:29:31.310 --> 01:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
clerk one year worked a 24-hour day she
 
01:29:32.990 --> 01:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
got to work at 4 in the morning and by
 
01:29:35.629 --> 01:29:35.639 align:start position:0%
the time everything was counted it was
 
01:29:38.590 --> 01:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
4M so I think we we should recognize the
 
01:29:41.070 --> 01:29:41.080 align:start position:0%
value of of the work that does have to
 
01:29:43.270 --> 01:29:43.280 align:start position:0%
happen on Election Day and if there are
 
01:29:46.189 --> 01:29:46.199 align:start position:0%
more people that could participate as
 
01:29:48.109 --> 01:29:48.119 align:start position:0%
election workers and do that Civ civil
 
01:29:50.149 --> 01:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
Duty that would be
 
01:29:53.629 --> 01:29:53.639 align:start position:0%
important for our state thank you other
 
01:29:53.639 --> 01:29:55.790 align:start position:0%
important for our state thank you other
questions

01:29:55.790 --> 01:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:29:55.800 --> 01:29:56.950 align:start position:0%
questions
represent

01:29:56.950 --> 01:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:29:59.750 --> 01:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam
 
01:30:03.470 --> 01:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
chair so the there are some downsides
 
01:30:07.590 --> 01:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
obviously to to making it a
 
01:30:11.870 --> 01:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
um legal holiday and in in the past when
 
01:30:15.270 --> 01:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
we've had similar bills or even
 
01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
identical bills that's been one of the
 
01:30:21.030 --> 01:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
objections that have led to the bill
 
01:30:24.470 --> 01:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
being itail um so
 
01:30:27.350 --> 01:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not seeing anyone other than the
 
01:30:31.149 --> 01:30:31.159 align:start position:0%
two of you here today um but uh have you
 
01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
gone through and looked at the downsides
 
01:30:39.470 --> 01:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of the lost wages or or lost um
 
01:30:42.950 --> 01:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh is is is going to be a paid
 
01:30:45.350 --> 01:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
holiday my my understanding is it's not
 
01:30:48.629 --> 01:30:48.639 align:start position:0%
a paid holiday but but I I don't know
 
01:30:50.990 --> 01:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
that I uh representative Reed could
 
01:30:54.430 --> 01:30:54.440 align:start position:0%
speak more to that but I think um we we
 
01:30:56.070 --> 01:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
should also look at what's the downside
 
01:30:57.750 --> 01:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
when people don't participate in
 
01:31:00.070 --> 01:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
elections um and and I think there is a
 
01:31:03.390 --> 01:31:03.400 align:start position:0%
cost to people not participating and not
 
01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
feeling like they are voice matters and
 
01:31:09.109 --> 01:31:09.119 align:start position:0%
they even know the date of of Elections
 
01:31:14.030 --> 01:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
um followup followup so uh um have you
 
01:31:17.990 --> 01:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
looked at the at the reality that that
 
01:31:25.510 --> 01:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
our election days um uh are not um
 
01:31:28.070 --> 01:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
they are not ve very seasonally
 
01:31:30.310 --> 01:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate in my opinion having an
 
01:31:33.550 --> 01:31:33.560 align:start position:0%
election day on in the first week in
 
01:31:37.109 --> 01:31:37.119 align:start position:0%
November can be a terrible day to have
 
01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
to stand out in the cold for hours um we
 
01:31:44.229 --> 01:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
had I think quite a nice day for
 
01:31:47.310 --> 01:31:47.320 align:start position:0%
election day uh this past time it was
 
01:31:49.149 --> 01:31:49.159 align:start position:0%
warm and we're all standing out there
 
01:31:51.189 --> 01:31:51.199 align:start position:0%
going like how can this be election day
 
01:31:54.109 --> 01:31:54.119 align:start position:0%
we're not freezing to death um but have
 
01:31:57.229 --> 01:31:57.239 align:start position:0%
you looked at possibly moving the the
 
01:32:01.629 --> 01:32:01.639 align:start position:0%
days around to to be we're we're not
 
01:32:04.590 --> 01:32:04.600 align:start position:0%
needing the day off for Harvest anymore
 
01:32:06.870 --> 01:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
so that's one of the reasons why it is
 
01:32:09.990 --> 01:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
where it is have you looked at that I I
 
01:32:11.390 --> 01:32:11.400 align:start position:0%
believe election day is set in our
 
01:32:13.270 --> 01:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
constitution so we would need a
 
01:32:15.030 --> 01:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment to change the
 
01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:16.109 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment to change the
first

01:32:16.109 --> 01:32:16.119 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:32:19.470 --> 01:32:19.480 align:start position:0%
Tuesday uh but but I think that there
 
01:32:21.189 --> 01:32:21.199 align:start position:0%
has been efforts of people I know that
 
01:32:22.790 --> 01:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
there's been conversations about moving
 
01:32:25.390 --> 01:32:25.400 align:start position:0%
it to other countries do elections on
 
01:32:28.629 --> 01:32:28.639 align:start position:0%
Sundays or other days um I so I think
 
01:32:31.430 --> 01:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
that there's been research done on
 
01:32:33.430 --> 01:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
what's the what's the best day to have
 
01:32:35.709 --> 01:32:35.719 align:start position:0%
elections but I think to move our
 
01:32:37.910 --> 01:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
elections there has been conversation in
 
01:32:39.350 --> 01:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
the election law committee about moving
 
01:32:41.750 --> 01:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
the DAT of the state primary to a
 
01:32:44.270 --> 01:32:44.280 align:start position:0%
different date and as we we know the pre
 
01:32:46.590 --> 01:32:46.600 align:start position:0%
uh the presidential primary date is set
 
01:32:49.990 --> 01:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
by the Secretary of State often not very
 
01:32:52.229 --> 01:32:52.239 align:start position:0%
much notice of the the date of the
 
01:32:55.350 --> 01:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
presidential primary is given out too um
 
01:32:58.109 --> 01:32:58.119 align:start position:0%
and I and that is a February uh We've
 
01:33:00.070 --> 01:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
also had Town meetings on snow days a
 
01:33:02.790 --> 01:33:02.800 align:start position:0%
lot of a lot of communities have had a
 
01:33:05.590 --> 01:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
foot of snow on election days so I I I
 
01:33:07.310 --> 01:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
agree with you that maybe it's not the
 
01:33:10.189 --> 01:33:10.199 align:start position:0%
best weather day but I I think that
 
01:33:11.870 --> 01:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
there we should look at all of the
 
01:33:13.990 --> 01:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
solutions but I think this is a good
 
01:33:17.510 --> 01:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
first step on um providing more
 
01:33:20.189 --> 01:33:20.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity for additional civic
 
01:33:22.189 --> 01:33:22.199 align:start position:0%
participation thank you for your effort
 
01:33:24.590 --> 01:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
and researching this
 
01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:25.950 align:start position:0%
and researching this
other

01:33:25.950 --> 01:33:25.960 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:33:31.229 --> 01:33:31.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:40.030 --> 01:33:40.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:42.109 --> 01:33:42.119 align:start position:0%
helpful thank you madam chair and thank
 
01:33:44.550 --> 01:33:44.560 align:start position:0%
you honorable members for uh recognizing
 
01:33:48.350 --> 01:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
me again um first I did a brief um
 
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
internet search
 
01:33:53.390 --> 01:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
approximately of our population of 1.3
 
01:33:56.390 --> 01:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
million people 10,000 people apparently
 
01:33:59.070 --> 01:33:59.080 align:start position:0%
roughly brief internet search are either
 
01:34:01.390 --> 01:34:01.400 align:start position:0%
state or town employees this wouldn't
 
01:34:03.510 --> 01:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
affect all of them as the chair um
 
01:34:06.229 --> 01:34:06.239 align:start position:0%
rightly pointed out um however in the
 
01:34:08.510 --> 01:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
question of paid versus
 
01:34:11.270 --> 01:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
unpaid it's not technically a paid
 
01:34:13.870 --> 01:34:13.880 align:start position:0%
holiday however there's caveats to that
 
01:34:16.550 --> 01:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
first of all most state employees are uh
 
01:34:18.629 --> 01:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
union members or fall under a Union
 
01:34:20.990 --> 01:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
contract more specifically and those
 
01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
contracts may include paid for holiday
 
01:34:26.590 --> 01:34:26.600 align:start position:0%
days secondly if you're a salaried
 
01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
employee um that may it's not a direct
 
01:34:32.390 --> 01:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
cost you're not paying extra for things
 
01:34:33.830 --> 01:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
you're not getting but you're losing a
 
01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
day of work my argument for that is that
 
01:34:39.790 --> 01:34:39.800 align:start position:0%
I think on a day where you have people
 
01:34:41.510 --> 01:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
coming in late to work because they had
 
01:34:43.550 --> 01:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
to go to the polls people leaving early
 
01:34:45.070 --> 01:34:45.080 align:start position:0%
from work because they have to go to the
 
01:34:46.990 --> 01:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
polls or people taking long lunch breaks
 
01:34:48.070 --> 01:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
because they had to go to the polls
 
01:34:50.709 --> 01:34:50.719 align:start position:0%
you're not losing that much productivity
 
01:34:53.510 --> 01:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
from that extra day just being given off
 
01:34:56.510 --> 01:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
um um also hourly employees would
 
01:34:59.149 --> 01:34:59.159 align:start position:0%
actually represent a savings to the
 
01:35:00.629 --> 01:35:00.639 align:start position:0%
state because you're not paying those
 
01:35:02.070 --> 01:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
hourly employees who are now getting the
 
01:35:05.430 --> 01:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
day off um as well as some overhead for
 
01:35:07.950 --> 01:35:07.960 align:start position:0%
for that now I think at the end of the
 
01:35:11.550 --> 01:35:11.560 align:start position:0%
day you're looking at mostly a uh a kind
 
01:35:14.830 --> 01:35:14.840 align:start position:0%
of wash but it's essentially the cost of
 
01:35:18.070 --> 01:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
a snow day minus the plows right it's
 
01:35:20.229 --> 01:35:20.239 align:start position:0%
the it's the productivity loss that we
 
01:35:22.109 --> 01:35:22.119 align:start position:0%
experience on a snow day and the
 
01:35:25.790 --> 01:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
question is is a democracy worth that
 
01:35:28.109 --> 01:35:28.119 align:start position:0%
democracies are expensive democracies
 
01:35:30.390 --> 01:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
are messy and they are worth all of it
 
01:35:32.669 --> 01:35:32.679 align:start position:0%
they're worth every penny um the last
 
01:35:35.430 --> 01:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
piece I wanted to say on the town level
 
01:35:39.990 --> 01:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
is that um so most schools schools that
 
01:35:41.790 --> 01:35:41.800 align:start position:0%
operate as a polling place are closed
 
01:35:44.030 --> 01:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
now on Election Day there was a time
 
01:35:46.350 --> 01:35:46.360 align:start position:0%
when uh schools would some schools would
 
01:35:48.510 --> 01:35:48.520 align:start position:0%
try to remain open then the question of
 
01:35:51.629 --> 01:35:51.639 align:start position:0%
our guns and polling places allowable
 
01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
came and so schools just decided to to
 
01:35:56.030 --> 01:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
close so we're already closing those
 
01:35:58.470 --> 01:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
schools so that's already basically a
 
01:36:01.830 --> 01:36:01.840 align:start position:0%
snow day anyway on a Tuesday so I think
 
01:36:04.270 --> 01:36:04.280 align:start position:0%
the point is it's worth it culturally
 
01:36:05.550 --> 01:36:05.560 align:start position:0%
it's worth it logistically to give
 
01:36:07.430 --> 01:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
people the day off to go vote the time
 
01:36:08.790 --> 01:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
to go vote the time to take their
 
01:36:10.390 --> 01:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
children who are already off of school
 
01:36:11.870 --> 01:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
and they probably need to stay home from
 
01:36:14.149 --> 01:36:14.159 align:start position:0%
work to take care of the kids anyway the
 
01:36:15.790 --> 01:36:15.800 align:start position:0%
time to take them into the polling place
 
01:36:18.070 --> 01:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
and show them democracy at work but the
 
01:36:20.390 --> 01:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
more valuable thing we get out of that
 
01:36:21.790 --> 01:36:21.800 align:start position:0%
is that people know they're going to
 
01:36:23.310 --> 01:36:23.320 align:start position:0%
have this day off they see it coming up
 
01:36:25.310 --> 01:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
on calendar they're thinking about the
 
01:36:26.750 --> 01:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
idea of Civic engagement they're
 
01:36:28.709 --> 01:36:28.719 align:start position:0%
thinking about their civic duty and it
 
01:36:30.870 --> 01:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
be it shifts us culturally to caring
 
01:36:33.990 --> 01:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
more about engaging with our government
 
01:36:37.189 --> 01:36:37.199 align:start position:0%
because our government is
 
01:36:37.199 --> 01:36:38.750 align:start position:0%
because our government is
US

01:36:38.750 --> 01:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
US
 
01:36:41.350 --> 01:36:41.360 align:start position:0%
Schmid thank you madam chairman have you
 
01:36:46.149 --> 01:36:46.159 align:start position:0%
given uh any thought to special election
 
01:36:49.030 --> 01:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
situations obviously they're limited to
 
01:36:52.470 --> 01:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
that District um but it's also very
 
01:36:55.550 --> 01:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
important and it's also an expense to
 
01:36:59.310 --> 01:36:59.320 align:start position:0%
the local community when they have to um
 
01:37:01.189 --> 01:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
run the election because they have to
 
01:37:03.510 --> 01:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
have the pole workers and so forth so
 
01:37:06.030 --> 01:37:06.040 align:start position:0%
it's a big deal in a way for the town to
 
01:37:07.669 --> 01:37:07.679 align:start position:0%
have to come up with an extra three or
 
01:37:11.149 --> 01:37:11.159 align:start position:0%
$4,000 which is easily is have you given
 
01:37:13.430 --> 01:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
any thought to that I have given thought
 
01:37:15.030 --> 01:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
to special elections I have given
 
01:37:16.910 --> 01:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
thought to local elections Municipal
 
01:37:18.669 --> 01:37:18.679 align:start position:0%
elections I didn't include them in this
 
01:37:20.109 --> 01:37:20.119 align:start position:0%
bill because I thought this was a big
 
01:37:22.550 --> 01:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
enough ask as it was if this committee
 
01:37:24.310 --> 01:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
saw fit to include all of those things
 
01:37:26.270 --> 01:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
in this bill I would be as happy as a
 
01:37:29.149 --> 01:37:29.159 align:start position:0%
clam but having said that I think it's
 
01:37:31.910 --> 01:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
best to get the big stuff while we can
 
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
and it's better to have something over
 
01:37:38.669 --> 01:37:38.679 align:start position:0%
nothing thank you okay other other
 
01:37:41.109 --> 01:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
questions all right not seeing any thank
 
01:37:43.109 --> 01:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
you for represent oh representative
 
01:37:45.950 --> 01:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
settlers thank you thank you madam chair
 
01:37:49.310 --> 01:37:49.320 align:start position:0%
so my concern is and you mentioned it is
 
01:37:52.629 --> 01:37:52.639 align:start position:0%
equality among employees some a salary
 
01:37:56.030 --> 01:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
some a union and some of them are hourly
 
01:37:57.870 --> 01:37:57.880 align:start position:0%
those hourly ones wouldn't be paid but
 
01:37:59.790 --> 01:37:59.800 align:start position:0%
the other two could be
 
01:38:02.950 --> 01:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
paid so right hourly employees would
 
01:38:07.430 --> 01:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
stand who who by the way almost all of
 
01:38:10.310 --> 01:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
our state employees are under a Union
 
01:38:14.189 --> 01:38:14.199 align:start position:0%
contract so even the hourly employees
 
01:38:17.070 --> 01:38:17.080 align:start position:0%
are still under a Union contract there's
 
01:38:20.510 --> 01:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
nothing preventing them from getting um
 
01:38:22.870 --> 01:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
that in a contract and saying we had the
 
01:38:24.750 --> 01:38:24.760 align:start position:0%
day off we need to be paid for that day
 
01:38:27.870 --> 01:38:27.880 align:start position:0%
and in fact that's explicitly um talked
 
01:38:30.430 --> 01:38:30.440 align:start position:0%
about in the bill um It also says that
 
01:38:32.310 --> 01:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
if you have the day off you can or you
 
01:38:34.030 --> 01:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
can you might have to work that day but
 
01:38:36.510 --> 01:38:36.520 align:start position:0%
then you get another day off in exchange
 
01:38:37.990 --> 01:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
so the only people who would be
 
01:38:39.990 --> 01:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
experiencing an actual monetary loss
 
01:38:42.550 --> 01:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
would potentially be those hourly
 
01:38:44.589 --> 01:38:44.599 align:start position:0%
workers experiencing a loss of one day
 
01:38:47.030 --> 01:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
of work but most of those are in a Union
 
01:38:48.350 --> 01:38:48.360 align:start position:0%
contract where they could easily
 
01:38:50.430 --> 01:38:50.440 align:start position:0%
negotiate I don't know about easily but
 
01:38:52.229 --> 01:38:52.239 align:start position:0%
could negotiate and may already have a
 
01:38:54.470 --> 01:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
negotiation in place that pays them for
 
01:38:57.790 --> 01:38:57.800 align:start position:0%
state holidays thank you other
 
01:39:00.629 --> 01:39:00.639 align:start position:0%
questions all right very good thank you
 
01:39:02.550 --> 01:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
again Madam is there anyone else who
 
01:39:06.149 --> 01:39:06.159 align:start position:0%
wishes to testify on House Bill 52
 
01:39:08.350 --> 01:39:08.360 align:start position:0%
obviously not all right then I'm going
 
01:39:12.830 --> 01:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:15.790 --> 01:39:15.800 align:start position:0%
hearing sure all right in that case
 
01:39:18.350 --> 01:39:18.360 align:start position:0%
we're going into executive session does
 
01:39:20.189 --> 01:39:20.199 align:start position:0%
someone have a motion representative
 
01:39:24.589 --> 01:39:24.599 align:start position:0%
Howard I want to move a to pass on uh uh
 
01:39:28.070 --> 01:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
hb52 I'll second that
 
01:39:31.229 --> 01:39:31.239 align:start position:0%
motion that was thetion you B who
 
01:39:33.750 --> 01:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
seconded it okay thank
 
01:39:37.470 --> 01:39:37.480 align:start position:0%
you Howard and TBO uh represent Howard
 
01:39:39.109 --> 01:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
do you wish to speak to your motion yes
 
01:39:41.189 --> 01:39:41.199 align:start position:0%
I will thank you uh Madam chair this
 
01:39:43.709 --> 01:39:43.719 align:start position:0%
bill helps provide our citizens access
 
01:39:45.430 --> 01:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
to their rights and perform their civic
 
01:39:47.990 --> 01:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
duty it it does not force private
 
01:39:50.629 --> 01:39:50.639 align:start position:0%
employers to give employees the day off
 
01:39:53.950 --> 01:39:53.960 align:start position:0%
or pay them for their time missed we are
 
01:39:56.149 --> 01:39:56.159 align:start position:0%
also struggling to recruit pole workers
 
01:39:58.229 --> 01:39:58.239 align:start position:0%
currently and this would help us provide
 
01:40:01.149 --> 01:40:01.159 align:start position:0%
potential volunteers uh and with that I
 
01:40:02.629 --> 01:40:02.639 align:start position:0%
uh hope that you will all support the
 
01:40:03.790 --> 01:40:03.800 align:start position:0%
Bill thank
 
01:40:06.910 --> 01:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
you repres T I would agree with what
 
01:40:08.790 --> 01:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
representative Howard said I think it's
 
01:40:10.430 --> 01:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
really good to increase turnout and I
 
01:40:12.310 --> 01:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
would also point out the logistical
 
01:40:14.270 --> 01:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
hurdles that come with st schools being
 
01:40:16.870 --> 01:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
open on Election Day it prevents
 
01:40:18.390 --> 01:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
students who are old enough to vote from
 
01:40:21.070 --> 01:40:21.080 align:start position:0%
being able to vote and it um creates
 
01:40:22.229 --> 01:40:22.239 align:start position:0%
those logistical hurdles that
 
01:40:23.870 --> 01:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
representative Reed mentioned with
 
01:40:26.229 --> 01:40:26.239 align:start position:0%
Firearms being carried in schools that
 
01:40:29.589 --> 01:40:29.599 align:start position:0%
are typically gun-free zones so in light
 
01:40:32.430 --> 01:40:32.440 align:start position:0%
of that and the fact that um encouraging
 
01:40:34.390 --> 01:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
voter turnout is always a positive thing
 
01:40:35.750 --> 01:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
I would also encourage an a to pass
 
01:40:40.870 --> 01:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:44.350 --> 01:40:44.360 align:start position:0%
you okay I would like to since nobody
 
01:40:46.550 --> 01:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
else seems to want to talk I'd like to
 
01:40:50.149 --> 01:40:50.159 align:start position:0%
say that I'm I'm opposed to this because
 
01:40:51.870 --> 01:40:51.880 align:start position:0%
it seems to
 
01:40:55.030 --> 01:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
give government
 
01:40:57.830 --> 01:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
workers additional holidays that private
 
01:41:00.030 --> 01:41:00.040 align:start position:0%
sector workers don't have even if they
 
01:41:04.510 --> 01:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
can take a couple of hours off it for it
 
01:41:08.430 --> 01:41:08.440 align:start position:0%
forces a
 
01:41:12.830 --> 01:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
uh it forces the taxpayers to fund extra
 
01:41:14.990 --> 01:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
pay because I'm I'm sure that even
 
01:41:17.270 --> 01:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
though this bill doesn't say so they
 
01:41:19.870 --> 01:41:19.880 align:start position:0%
government workers will expect to be
 
01:41:23.669 --> 01:41:23.679 align:start position:0%
paid for their time off or uh in the
 
01:41:26.270 --> 01:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
case of election workers they're their
 
01:41:28.109 --> 01:41:28.119 align:start position:0%
hard their hardworking
 
01:41:28.119 --> 01:41:29.709 align:start position:0%
hard their hardworking
time

01:41:29.709 --> 01:41:29.719 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:41:29.719 --> 01:41:31.629 align:start position:0%
time
um

01:41:31.629 --> 01:41:31.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:35.430 --> 01:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
and I think it it's a
 
01:41:39.270 --> 01:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
however we want to get people to
 
01:41:42.950 --> 01:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
vote it is possible to learn when the
 
01:41:46.870 --> 01:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:49.709 --> 01:41:49.719 align:start position:0%
are and if you don't care enough to find
 
01:41:53.790 --> 01:41:53.800 align:start position:0%
out I'm not sure that we need to to
 
01:41:57.790 --> 01:41:57.800 align:start position:0%
force you to vote so I'm
 
01:42:01.390 --> 01:42:01.400 align:start position:0%
opposed representative Sellers and then
 
01:42:04.830 --> 01:42:04.840 align:start position:0%
scitec thank you madam chair uh on those
 
01:42:07.790 --> 01:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
on that line there is I would rather see
 
01:42:10.149 --> 01:42:10.159 align:start position:0%
a state holiday than just a government
 
01:42:12.950 --> 01:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
holiday because it's again you are
 
01:42:14.510 --> 01:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
putting the government employees in a
 
01:42:16.790 --> 01:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
class of employees saying hey we're
 
01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
going to give you the right to take up
 
01:42:21.109 --> 01:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
to three hours off but any other
 
01:42:24.149 --> 01:42:24.159 align:start position:0%
business in the state you f yourself and
 
01:42:26.350 --> 01:42:26.360 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't seem like we're treating
 
01:42:29.030 --> 01:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
everybody with equality and like the
 
01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:30.709 align:start position:0%
everybody with equality and like the
repres

01:42:30.709 --> 01:42:30.719 align:start position:0%
repres
 
01:42:35.470 --> 01:42:35.480 align:start position:0%
sitech this just seems uh to be getting
 
01:42:39.149 --> 01:42:39.159 align:start position:0%
very complicated and I'm not uh I don't
 
01:42:41.990 --> 01:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
see anything particularly wrong with the
 
01:42:45.070 --> 01:42:45.080 align:start position:0%
the situation as it is now with the
 
01:42:48.310 --> 01:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
three hours given to people who can who
 
01:42:53.350 --> 01:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
want to be off as um so it I don't think
 
01:42:56.830 --> 01:42:56.840 align:start position:0%
C The Cure is that the problem needs
 
01:43:00.430 --> 01:43:00.440 align:start position:0%
this this complex a cure the other thing
 
01:43:02.750 --> 01:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
is I'm going to say something that's you
 
01:43:05.589 --> 01:43:05.599 align:start position:0%
may not want to hear I'm if people don't
 
01:43:08.070 --> 01:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
want to vote I don't want them to vote I
 
01:43:10.510 --> 01:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
want informed voters who care about
 
01:43:12.830 --> 01:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
democracy not about people being
 
01:43:15.910 --> 01:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
compelled urged uh to get out lightly
 
01:43:19.990 --> 01:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
informed voters I'm I'm just not just
 
01:43:23.629 --> 01:43:23.639 align:start position:0%
not in favor of that okay r l
 
01:43:26.229 --> 01:43:26.239 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair um I do think
 
01:43:27.830 --> 01:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
that this has an issue where it ends up
 
01:43:29.669 --> 01:43:29.679 align:start position:0%
having two classes of people you have
 
01:43:31.510 --> 01:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
state employees and local employees who
 
01:43:33.270 --> 01:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
have the full day off in order to do
 
01:43:35.470 --> 01:43:35.480 align:start position:0%
this and then you have what probably
 
01:43:36.990 --> 01:43:37.000 align:start position:0%
will end up being restricted to only
 
01:43:38.589 --> 01:43:38.599 align:start position:0%
three days off for people at private
 
01:43:41.350 --> 01:43:41.360 align:start position:0%
employers because once you set a certain
 
01:43:43.149 --> 01:43:43.159 align:start position:0%
limit a lot of people will treat that as
 
01:43:46.189 --> 01:43:46.199 align:start position:0%
a floor um Additionally you have the
 
01:43:48.350 --> 01:43:48.360 align:start position:0%
challenge where in my town we have a
 
01:43:50.709 --> 01:43:50.719 align:start position:0%
number of different schools um we've
 
01:43:52.669 --> 01:43:52.679 align:start position:0%
been having elections at Pinkerton but
 
01:43:55.229 --> 01:43:55.239 align:start position:0%
we've kept other schools open especially
 
01:43:56.790 --> 01:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
because that creates other child care
 
01:43:58.790 --> 01:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
issues when you're moving people around
 
01:44:01.350 --> 01:44:01.360 align:start position:0%
having a one-sized fits-all approach to
 
01:44:04.870 --> 01:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
this is a bit of a challenge and most
 
01:44:07.470 --> 01:44:07.480 align:start position:0%
importantly how is an employee going to
 
01:44:08.950 --> 01:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
show that they're three hours away from
 
01:44:10.830 --> 01:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
work or for voting are they going to
 
01:44:12.470 --> 01:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
bring something that says that they
 
01:44:14.870 --> 01:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
voted in the Republican primary and then
 
01:44:16.109 --> 01:44:16.119 align:start position:0%
they're telling their employer that
 
01:44:18.270 --> 01:44:18.280 align:start position:0%
they're voting Republican or likewise
 
01:44:20.390 --> 01:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
that they voted in the Democrat primary
 
01:44:22.310 --> 01:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
now at that point when does this become
 
01:44:23.870 --> 01:44:23.880 align:start position:0%
a discussion about who you're voting
 
01:44:26.830 --> 01:44:26.840 align:start position:0%
about voting for um to your employer and
 
01:44:29.149 --> 01:44:29.159 align:start position:0%
I think that this is while while really
 
01:44:30.470 --> 01:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
well-intentioned I think that this
 
01:44:33.510 --> 01:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
brings a slippery slope representative
 
01:44:35.470 --> 01:44:35.480 align:start position:0%
de and then
 
01:44:37.629 --> 01:44:37.639 align:start position:0%
Pearson I'll gu to representative
 
01:44:40.070 --> 01:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
Pearson oh representative
 
01:44:42.629 --> 01:44:42.639 align:start position:0%
Pearson sen what you do in a primary
 
01:44:45.550 --> 01:44:45.560 align:start position:0%
election is public information so that
 
01:44:47.589 --> 01:44:47.599 align:start position:0%
that one's not
 
01:44:49.950 --> 01:44:49.960 align:start position:0%
gonna how someone votes and which card
 
01:44:53.669 --> 01:44:53.679 align:start position:0%
they pull is you can get so that's um
 
01:44:55.270 --> 01:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm trying to I'm trying to wrestle
 
01:44:56.870 --> 01:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
with this because the concept I I don't
 
01:45:00.790 --> 01:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
have a problem with um you know
 
01:45:03.870 --> 01:45:03.880 align:start position:0%
we we love to talk
 
01:45:07.310 --> 01:45:07.320 align:start position:0%
about turnout and all of the efforts
 
01:45:11.430 --> 01:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
that go with that and that effort which
 
01:45:13.790 --> 01:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
has been going on for a long time has
 
01:45:16.709 --> 01:45:16.719 align:start position:0%
Merit um the other the other thing to
 
01:45:21.790 --> 01:45:21.800 align:start position:0%
wrestle here as far as the giving giving
 
01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
this to one group or or
 
01:45:26.430 --> 01:45:26.440 align:start position:0%
another we have a bit of an ideological
 
01:45:28.470 --> 01:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
conflict in the sense that are we as the
 
01:45:30.470 --> 01:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
government going to start to force
 
01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:31.470 align:start position:0%
government going to start to force
private

01:45:31.470 --> 01:45:31.480 align:start position:0%
private
 
01:45:34.950 --> 01:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
Enterprise to give time off to people
 
01:45:36.510 --> 01:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
that is generally
 
01:45:41.109 --> 01:45:41.119 align:start position:0%
not something that the Republican party
 
01:45:43.750 --> 01:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
is been doing we've been we've been
 
01:45:46.950 --> 01:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
hands off so we we kind of we're kind of
 
01:45:48.510 --> 01:45:48.520 align:start position:0%
in a bit of a conundrum here in the
 
01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:50.229 align:start position:0%
in a bit of a conundrum here in the
sense

01:45:50.229 --> 01:45:50.239 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:45:53.310 --> 01:45:53.320 align:start position:0%
that do we you know the idea of of a
 
01:45:57.109 --> 01:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
state holiday which has Merit in in
 
01:45:59.629 --> 01:45:59.639 align:start position:0%
making this you know a day off for
 
01:46:02.910 --> 01:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
everybody then does the argument of
 
01:46:04.750 --> 01:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
mandating this on a on private
 
01:46:10.750 --> 01:46:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:13.830 --> 01:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
so I'm more I'm more leaning towards the
 
01:46:15.589 --> 01:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
I the idea that we don't really
 
01:46:17.350 --> 01:46:17.360 align:start position:0%
interfere with private businesses on
 
01:46:21.270 --> 01:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
this one but
 
01:46:24.750 --> 01:46:24.760 align:start position:0%
um I can't see shutting this concept off
 
01:46:27.950 --> 01:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
we we the argument that representative
 
01:46:30.350 --> 01:46:30.360 align:start position:0%
Reed made is in reference to some of the
 
01:46:32.709 --> 01:46:32.719 align:start position:0%
other holidays we have and and not that
 
01:46:34.589 --> 01:46:34.599 align:start position:0%
we're valuing one over another or
 
01:46:36.390 --> 01:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
stacking them or raing them or any of
 
01:46:39.470 --> 01:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
that but the the concept that that the
 
01:46:42.390 --> 01:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
great experiment as it was once called
 
01:46:44.510 --> 01:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
um does
 
01:46:48.030 --> 01:46:48.040 align:start position:0%
not facilitate ways in which its people
 
01:46:50.870 --> 01:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
can exercise that experiment to me is a
 
01:46:54.629 --> 01:46:54.639 align:start position:0%
little weird so
 
01:46:57.510 --> 01:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
um so I I think that you know we we've
 
01:47:00.070 --> 01:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
got to we've got to wrestle with with
 
01:47:02.870 --> 01:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
where the ideological split occurs here
 
01:47:07.310 --> 01:47:07.320 align:start position:0%
and what our intended goals are here and
 
01:47:09.870 --> 01:47:09.880 align:start position:0%
for that right now I'm lean in I will
 
01:47:11.629 --> 01:47:11.639 align:start position:0%
lean in favor of
 
01:47:14.510 --> 01:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
autopass Representative D thank you
 
01:47:17.149 --> 01:47:17.159 align:start position:0%
madam chair um I have a couple of points
 
01:47:18.830 --> 01:47:18.840 align:start position:0%
I'd like to make is we pride ourselves
 
01:47:21.390 --> 01:47:21.400 align:start position:0%
here in uh the granite state on being
 
01:47:23.350 --> 01:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
the first in the nation and yet don't
 
01:47:26.709 --> 01:47:26.719 align:start position:0%
give state employees the day off um so I
 
01:47:28.830 --> 01:47:28.840 align:start position:0%
think that that weighs in favor of that
 
01:47:31.589 --> 01:47:31.599 align:start position:0%
argument if we were to pass this where
 
01:47:34.229 --> 01:47:34.239 align:start position:0%
vote ought to pass um I also am a small
 
01:47:37.709 --> 01:47:37.719 align:start position:0%
business owner and the the article here
 
01:47:39.750 --> 01:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
sorry the language here on line 20 it
 
01:47:42.629 --> 01:47:42.639 align:start position:0%
says all other employers shall when
 
01:47:45.109 --> 01:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
practicable allow employees up to three
 
01:47:47.310 --> 01:47:47.320 align:start position:0%
hours away from work um I think that
 
01:47:49.390 --> 01:47:49.400 align:start position:0%
that is language of
 
01:47:52.390 --> 01:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
encouragement um and I think that's
 
01:47:54.510 --> 01:47:54.520 align:start position:0%
something that we should be supporting
 
01:47:56.350 --> 01:47:56.360 align:start position:0%
um I as a small business owner was so
 
01:47:57.990 --> 01:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
compelled by the testimony that happened
 
01:47:59.709 --> 01:47:59.719 align:start position:0%
here today um we're going to we're going
 
01:48:02.709 --> 01:48:02.719 align:start position:0%
to make it a a day off for for our team
 
01:48:06.350 --> 01:48:06.360 align:start position:0%
um and in Hampton in this most recent
 
01:48:07.950 --> 01:48:07.960 align:start position:0%
presidential election Hampton where I'm
 
01:48:09.790 --> 01:48:09.800 align:start position:0%
from some people were standing in line
 
01:48:12.030 --> 01:48:12.040 align:start position:0%
up to two to two and a half hours um
 
01:48:14.470 --> 01:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
waiting to vote and I think that
 
01:48:17.669 --> 01:48:17.679 align:start position:0%
allowing three or encouraging 3 hours
 
01:48:21.070 --> 01:48:21.080 align:start position:0%
for private employers um makes a lot of
 
01:48:22.550 --> 01:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
sense because sometimes the lines are
 
01:48:24.350 --> 01:48:24.360 align:start position:0%
pretty particularly long so I I'm going
 
01:48:26.270 --> 01:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
to be voting in favor of a I'm going to
 
01:48:28.350 --> 01:48:28.360 align:start position:0%
vote for autopass thank you
 
01:48:28.360 --> 01:48:30.390 align:start position:0%
vote for autopass thank you
representative

01:48:30.390 --> 01:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:48:33.910 --> 01:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
BR thank you um I do want to say that
 
01:48:35.669 --> 01:48:35.679 align:start position:0%
we've heard this bill
 
01:48:40.870 --> 01:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
before and we have also heard um reasons
 
01:48:44.270 --> 01:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
not to support it and I'm encouraged to
 
01:48:46.990 --> 01:48:47.000 align:start position:0%
hear all the reasons to vote for it and
 
01:48:49.030 --> 01:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
I can understand the difficulty in
 
01:48:50.709 --> 01:48:50.719 align:start position:0%
making that
 
01:48:53.750 --> 01:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
decision um this doesn't mandate anyone
 
01:48:57.149 --> 01:48:57.159 align:start position:0%
to vote this doesn't mandate anyone to
 
01:48:59.589 --> 01:48:59.599 align:start position:0%
do anything other than think about the
 
01:49:02.629 --> 01:49:02.639 align:start position:0%
day as a voting day and if that's moves
 
01:49:02.639 --> 01:49:03.550 align:start position:0%
day as a voting day and if that's moves
the

01:49:03.550 --> 01:49:03.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:49:05.950 --> 01:49:05.960 align:start position:0%
needle then that's fine because that's
 
01:49:07.589 --> 01:49:07.599 align:start position:0%
what we're supposed to be doing
 
01:49:08.910 --> 01:49:08.920 align:start position:0%
democracy is
 
01:49:11.350 --> 01:49:11.360 align:start position:0%
work so I'll be supporting the bill
 
01:49:13.550 --> 01:49:13.560 align:start position:0%
although in the past I had not I will
 
01:49:13.560 --> 01:49:15.430 align:start position:0%
although in the past I had not I will
this

01:49:15.430 --> 01:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:49:18.709 --> 01:49:18.719 align:start position:0%
time represent Leon thank you madam
 
01:49:21.149 --> 01:49:21.159 align:start position:0%
chair um I do recognize that our voting
 
01:49:23.229 --> 01:49:23.239 align:start position:0%
records are available and we can find
 
01:49:25.790 --> 01:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
out which way that somebody has voted
 
01:49:28.149 --> 01:49:28.159 align:start position:0%
however having an excused absence for
 
01:49:30.390 --> 01:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
voting just really increases the need
 
01:49:31.990 --> 01:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
for somebody to look into somebody's
 
01:49:34.750 --> 01:49:34.760 align:start position:0%
voting history and I I see that as a
 
01:49:36.750 --> 01:49:36.760 align:start position:0%
trouble um I do agree that we shouldn't
 
01:49:38.830 --> 01:49:38.840 align:start position:0%
be mandating things on small businesses
 
01:49:41.950 --> 01:49:41.960 align:start position:0%
or any private businesses and since this
 
01:49:43.870 --> 01:49:43.880 align:start position:0%
would be a disparity between public
 
01:49:46.310 --> 01:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
employees and private employees I think
 
01:49:47.910 --> 01:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
that that's a good reason not to do this
 
01:49:49.790 --> 01:49:49.800 align:start position:0%
in the first place and that is why I
 
01:49:52.430 --> 01:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
will be opposing this okay represent
 
01:49:52.440 --> 01:49:53.709 align:start position:0%
will be opposing this okay represent
power

01:49:53.709 --> 01:49:53.719 align:start position:0%
power
 
01:49:55.990 --> 01:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to say that online we had
 
01:49:57.910 --> 01:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
83 people in support in three in
 
01:50:00.510 --> 01:50:00.520 align:start position:0%
opposition thank you thank you
 
01:50:00.520 --> 01:50:02.070 align:start position:0%
opposition thank you thank you
representive

01:50:02.070 --> 01:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
representive
 
01:50:04.709 --> 01:50:04.719 align:start position:0%
sellers thank you m my last Point first
 
01:50:06.390 --> 01:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
of all I like the idea of getting the
 
01:50:08.430 --> 01:50:08.440 align:start position:0%
day off I do I think that's great
 
01:50:10.470 --> 01:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
especially for elections you know get
 
01:50:11.790 --> 01:50:11.800 align:start position:0%
people to
 
01:50:13.990 --> 01:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
participate however there is no fiscal
 
01:50:16.669 --> 01:50:16.679 align:start position:0%
note and if we are giving employees 3
 
01:50:20.589 --> 01:50:20.599 align:start position:0%
hours off times 10,000 employees times
 
01:50:23.990 --> 01:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
$25 an hour or there BS you know we're
 
01:50:26.189 --> 01:50:26.199 align:start position:0%
starting to add up into a just for that
 
01:50:28.709 --> 01:50:28.719 align:start position:0%
one day towards towards a million
 
01:50:30.950 --> 01:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
dollars yes thank you representative Lon
 
01:50:32.629 --> 01:50:32.639 align:start position:0%
you have a comment on that um yes thank
 
01:50:34.870 --> 01:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um I I just wanted to
 
01:50:36.510 --> 01:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
point out to representative sellers that
 
01:50:38.510 --> 01:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
that three hours is for the non
 
01:50:40.790 --> 01:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
non-government employees this likely
 
01:50:43.229 --> 01:50:43.239 align:start position:0%
would be interpreted as a full day off
 
01:50:45.470 --> 01:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
for both the primary the presidential
 
01:50:48.229 --> 01:50:48.239 align:start position:0%
primary and election day and any of
 
01:50:50.470 --> 01:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
these other days that they may or may
 
01:50:53.510 --> 01:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
not be taking off as a holiday so this
 
01:50:55.069 --> 01:50:55.079 align:start position:0%
has potential of being a very
 
01:50:57.990 --> 01:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
significant fiscal note um and further I
 
01:50:59.430 --> 01:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
would state that if we have the day off
 
01:51:00.709 --> 01:51:00.719 align:start position:0%
perhaps we don't need to have the
 
01:51:02.510 --> 01:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
exemption to the absentee ballots that
 
01:51:04.589 --> 01:51:04.599 align:start position:0%
if you need to work you can take an
 
01:51:05.990 --> 01:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot because if we're
 
01:51:07.910 --> 01:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
guaranteeing the day off perhaps that
 
01:51:10.950 --> 01:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
exemption wouldn't be needed
 
01:51:10.960 --> 01:51:12.550 align:start position:0%
exemption wouldn't be needed
then

01:51:12.550 --> 01:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:51:15.510 --> 01:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
yes I was going to point out that if you
 
01:51:17.910 --> 01:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
are are working all day and can't get to
 
01:51:17.920 --> 01:51:18.629 align:start position:0%
are are working all day and can't get to
the

01:51:18.629 --> 01:51:18.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:51:21.430 --> 01:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
polls you can get an absentee ballot now
 
01:51:23.270 --> 01:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
it's one of the legitimate reasons for
 
01:51:26.189 --> 01:51:26.199 align:start position:0%
an absentee ballot and I know people
 
01:51:30.790 --> 01:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
that do so I will also mention that I uh
 
01:51:33.270 --> 01:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
once worked for a company that had whose
 
01:51:36.109 --> 01:51:36.119 align:start position:0%
Union had negotiated election day as a
 
01:51:38.270 --> 01:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
holiday which
 
01:51:41.030 --> 01:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
was in most cases the most useless
 
01:51:43.189 --> 01:51:43.199 align:start position:0%
holiday you could ever have because it's
 
01:51:45.189 --> 01:51:45.199 align:start position:0%
on a Tuesday in early
 
01:51:49.189 --> 01:51:49.199 align:start position:0%
November and unless you were a hunter
 
01:51:51.790 --> 01:51:51.800 align:start position:0%
which it there's not much really going
 
01:51:55.030 --> 01:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
on on Tuesday in November um but we had
 
01:51:57.589 --> 01:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
it off so presumably so that they could
 
01:52:00.430 --> 01:52:00.440 align:start position:0%

to split things up in a day of
 
03:26:59.389 --> 03:26:59.399 align:start position:0%
monotonous public hearings but um my
 
03:27:00.950 --> 03:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
name is representative Joe Alexander I
 
03:27:03.469 --> 03:27:03.479 align:start position:0%
represent the town of gtown um I'm here
 
03:27:08.229 --> 03:27:08.239 align:start position:0%
to introduce hb89 um a bill that is is
 
03:27:10.189 --> 03:27:10.199 align:start position:0%
done by a Creator who grew up in gtown
 
03:27:13.229 --> 03:27:13.239 align:start position:0%
but is very New Hampshire based um film
 
03:27:15.790 --> 03:27:15.800 align:start position:0%
and as you can see this this is a story
 
03:27:18.269 --> 03:27:18.279 align:start position:0%
about the a story about the creation of
 
03:27:20.229 --> 03:27:20.239 align:start position:0%
the Old Man of the Mountain um I had
 
03:27:23.550 --> 03:27:23.560 align:start position:0%
first met Griffin a couple years ago uh
 
03:27:26.510 --> 03:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
when he had asked um called me as his
 
03:27:28.189 --> 03:27:28.199 align:start position:0%
State Rep because he was very upset out
 
03:27:30.950 --> 03:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
of it uh because a historical marker was
 
03:27:33.870 --> 03:27:33.880 align:start position:0%
being taken from um someplace around the
 
03:27:35.830 --> 03:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
state house and he was communicating
 
03:27:37.349 --> 03:27:37.359 align:start position:0%
that with me and we we had got to
 
03:27:40.229 --> 03:27:40.239 align:start position:0%
talking and um we stayed connected
 
03:27:42.070 --> 03:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
through that and when I heard that he
 
03:27:43.750 --> 03:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
was producing a film about the creation
 
03:27:45.150 --> 03:27:45.160 align:start position:0%
of the Old Man of the Mountain a story
 
03:27:48.269 --> 03:27:48.279 align:start position:0%
about it um I had offered to put this in
 
03:27:50.670 --> 03:27:50.680 align:start position:0%
um this is a story first of all a love
 
03:27:54.269 --> 03:27:54.279 align:start position:0%
story um between Sawyer and carrian but
 
03:27:56.110 --> 03:27:56.120 align:start position:0%
it's it's one story of many that can be
 
03:27:57.469 --> 03:27:57.479 align:start position:0%
attributed to the creation of the Old
 
03:27:59.189 --> 03:27:59.199 align:start position:0%
Man of the Mountain The Old Man of the
 
03:28:01.030 --> 03:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
Mountain is a symbol of the state and
 
03:28:03.030 --> 03:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
many do not know who the landmark is and
 
03:28:04.510 --> 03:28:04.520 align:start position:0%
you know as somebody who grew up in New
 
03:28:06.750 --> 03:28:06.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I was I think seven or eight
 
03:28:07.790 --> 03:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
years old when the Old Man of the
 
03:28:10.150 --> 03:28:10.160 align:start position:0%
Mountain fell but I think a lot of
 
03:28:12.389 --> 03:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
students and and children in New
 
03:28:14.630 --> 03:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire don't know who this symbol is
 
03:28:16.670 --> 03:28:16.680 align:start position:0%
and they might be like hey Mom like
 
03:28:19.790 --> 03:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
why is this old man on a on a root sign
 
03:28:21.070 --> 03:28:21.080 align:start position:0%
driving down the highway they don't know
 
03:28:23.750 --> 03:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
who this person is I think this is a
 
03:28:27.229 --> 03:28:27.239 align:start position:0%
very creative way to depict the story
 
03:28:29.389 --> 03:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
around the creation a story around the
 
03:28:32.110 --> 03:28:32.120 align:start position:0%
creation of the old man um that can be
 
03:28:34.309 --> 03:28:34.319 align:start position:0%
marketed towards young people so that
 
03:28:35.670 --> 03:28:35.680 align:start position:0%
they can feel like they are part of the
 
03:28:37.670 --> 03:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
culture and creation of our most
 
03:28:40.710 --> 03:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
important symbol that of of the state um
 
03:28:43.790 --> 03:28:43.800 align:start position:0%
I I also think briefly it draws on some
 
03:28:47.429 --> 03:28:47.439 align:start position:0%
key things that uh we as Granite Staters
 
03:28:49.950 --> 03:28:49.960 align:start position:0%
consider Granite State values I mean
 
03:28:54.429 --> 03:28:54.439 align:start position:0%
love perseverance the lack of greed um
 
03:28:56.670 --> 03:28:56.680 align:start position:0%
hard work the fact that Sawyer was
 
03:28:58.750 --> 03:28:58.760 align:start position:0%
Untouched by greed I think is important
 
03:29:00.910 --> 03:29:00.920 align:start position:0%
I think it's a key value to granted
 
03:29:04.269 --> 03:29:04.279 align:start position:0%
State citizen so um with that the
 
03:29:07.910 --> 03:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
Creator is here um to present the film
 
03:29:09.910 --> 03:29:09.920 align:start position:0%

find myself in the unique position to be
 
03:29:42.030 --> 03:29:42.040 align:start position:0%
seated before you today to talk about
 
03:29:43.990 --> 03:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
the merits and the qualities of a film
 
03:29:45.870 --> 03:29:45.880 align:start position:0%
that I directed and I co-wrote there's
 
03:29:47.590 --> 03:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
only only so much that I can say before
 
03:29:50.910 --> 03:29:50.920 align:start position:0%
it sounds boastful thus I sit here today
 
03:29:53.269 --> 03:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the over 30 talented young
 
03:29:55.389 --> 03:29:55.399 align:start position:0%
artists who brought within the crystal
 
03:29:59.110 --> 03:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
Hills to life artists from a vast array
 
03:30:02.189 --> 03:30:02.199 align:start position:0%
of backgrounds diverse backgrounds races
 
03:30:04.630 --> 03:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
and beliefs from the granite state and
 
03:30:07.189 --> 03:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
Beyond artists whose Artistry and
 
03:30:09.510 --> 03:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
dedication to Unique Vision made this
 
03:30:11.710 --> 03:30:11.720 align:start position:0%
film the success and the achievement
 
03:30:13.950 --> 03:30:13.960 align:start position:0%
that we believe it to be like many of
 
03:30:16.389 --> 03:30:16.399 align:start position:0%
them I grew up loving to draw and tell
 
03:30:18.429 --> 03:30:18.439 align:start position:0%
stories as a student at Maple Avenue
 
03:30:20.550 --> 03:30:20.560 align:start position:0%
Elementary School in gtown I used to
 
03:30:22.550 --> 03:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
draw comics in the panels of my math
 
03:30:24.950 --> 03:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
worksheets much to my teachers Chagrin
 
03:30:27.189 --> 03:30:27.199 align:start position:0%
naturally but I've always been very
 
03:30:29.309 --> 03:30:29.319 align:start position:0%
lucky to know precisely what I wanted to
 
03:30:32.349 --> 03:30:32.359 align:start position:0%
do make animated stories and yet there
 
03:30:34.469 --> 03:30:34.479 align:start position:0%
were obstacles I remember being in high
 
03:30:35.830 --> 03:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
school and meeting with a guidance
 
03:30:37.790 --> 03:30:37.800 align:start position:0%
counselor who I told I wanted to go to
 
03:30:40.750 --> 03:30:40.760 align:start position:0%
arts school and her response was why
 
03:30:44.150 --> 03:30:44.160 align:start position:0%
you're so smart to some extent that
 
03:30:46.630 --> 03:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
exact question is the reason I am here
 
03:30:49.550 --> 03:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
before you to me the Arts have always
 
03:30:52.630 --> 03:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
been an Avenue to explore extraordinary
 
03:30:54.790 --> 03:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
creative opportunities meet some of the
 
03:30:57.150 --> 03:30:57.160 align:start position:0%
most important people in my life and
 
03:30:59.550 --> 03:30:59.560 align:start position:0%
express my way if rather express myself
 
03:31:02.189 --> 03:31:02.199 align:start position:0%
in ways words fail to do for this
 
03:31:05.150 --> 03:31:05.160 align:start position:0%
committee to approve House Bill 89 would
 
03:31:07.030 --> 03:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
not be for them to hand me an Accolade
 
03:31:09.630 --> 03:31:09.640 align:start position:0%
for my resume but a chance for them to
 
03:31:12.469 --> 03:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
show artists in New Hampshire young and
 
03:31:14.870 --> 03:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
old that the pursuit of artistic
 
03:31:17.150 --> 03:31:17.160 align:start position:0%
self-expression is nothing to be
 
03:31:19.469 --> 03:31:19.479 align:start position:0%
discouraged from it can build
 
03:31:22.030 --> 03:31:22.040 align:start position:0%
communities promote local history and
 
03:31:24.269 --> 03:31:24.279 align:start position:0%
culture and lead to a more fulfilled
 
03:31:26.510 --> 03:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
being I'd like to explore one of those
 
03:31:28.830 --> 03:31:28.840 align:start position:0%
points if I may in writing this film my
 
03:31:31.429 --> 03:31:31.439 align:start position:0%
co-writer Christina corales and I dove
 
03:31:33.950 --> 03:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
into local Legends and mythology from
 
03:31:36.389 --> 03:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
the abanaki to Nathaniel Hawthorne and
 
03:31:38.150 --> 03:31:38.160 align:start position:0%
immersed ourselves in the research of
 
03:31:40.389 --> 03:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
the Franconia Heritage Museum the New
 
03:31:42.349 --> 03:31:42.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire historical society and our
 
03:31:45.030 --> 03:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
national parks service approval of House
 
03:31:47.630 --> 03:31:47.640 align:start position:0%
Bill 89 sends a clear message that
 
03:31:49.710 --> 03:31:49.720 align:start position:0%
stories woven from New Hampshire's deep
 
03:31:52.670 --> 03:31:52.680 align:start position:0%
tapestry of tradition history and
 
03:31:56.110 --> 03:31:56.120 align:start position:0%
culture are valuable you can find great
 
03:31:58.389 --> 03:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
inspiration for your creativity from the
 
03:31:59.950 --> 03:31:59.960 align:start position:0%
efforts of your local historical
 
03:32:02.469 --> 03:32:02.479 align:start position:0%
societies and libraries and while our
 
03:32:04.229 --> 03:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
film is a completely original
 
03:32:05.870 --> 03:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
reimagining of the Old Man of the
 
03:32:08.670 --> 03:32:08.680 align:start position:0%
Mountain the way it pulls from such a
 
03:32:12.070 --> 03:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
wide range of influences to craft a new
 
03:32:14.910 --> 03:32:14.920 align:start position:0%
narrative inspires viewers to come up
 
03:32:16.510 --> 03:32:16.520 align:start position:0%
with their own story Ries about the
 
03:32:19.990 --> 03:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
iconic profile this in turn leads to the
 
03:32:22.389 --> 03:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
aformentioned journey into local history
 
03:32:24.870 --> 03:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
and creative expression every member of
 
03:32:26.510 --> 03:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
this committee sits here today because
 
03:32:28.389 --> 03:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
at some point in their lives somebody
 
03:32:30.389 --> 03:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
told them that they can follow their
 
03:32:32.630 --> 03:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
dreams of leadership think about it for
 
03:32:37.269 --> 03:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
just a moment who told you you can this
 
03:32:40.830 --> 03:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
film tells artists in New Hampshire they
 
03:32:43.710 --> 03:32:43.720 align:start position:0%
can they can make meaningful connections
 
03:32:46.790 --> 03:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
through ART they can find inspiration
 
03:32:48.349 --> 03:32:48.359 align:start position:0%
through learning about their beautiful
 
03:32:51.389 --> 03:32:51.399 align:start position:0%
state they can be a little boy from gown
 
03:32:53.590 --> 03:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
who can grow up to sit before this
 
03:32:55.630 --> 03:32:55.640 align:start position:0%
committee and ask them to consider a
 
03:32:57.710 --> 03:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
film they made with their friends to
 
03:32:59.550 --> 03:32:59.560 align:start position:0%
represent all that is Limitless and
 
03:33:02.309 --> 03:33:02.319 align:start position:0%
inspiring not just about New Hampshire
 
03:33:05.710 --> 03:33:05.720 align:start position:0%
but the Arts thank you thank you are
 
03:33:07.990 --> 03:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
there questions from the
 
03:33:10.189 --> 03:33:10.199 align:start position:0%
committee um I have a question you said
 
03:33:12.389 --> 03:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
that this is a reimagining based upon
 
03:33:14.910 --> 03:33:14.920 align:start position:0%
different Tales um my question is just
 
03:33:16.910 --> 03:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
um if you think that having this be the
 
03:33:19.389 --> 03:33:19.399 align:start position:0%
granite state animated film would make
 
03:33:21.189 --> 03:33:21.199 align:start position:0%
people think that this is the one true
 
03:33:23.830 --> 03:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
history as opposed to one reimagining
 
03:33:26.189 --> 03:33:26.199 align:start position:0%
that's a fantastic point I think that
 
03:33:28.510 --> 03:33:28.520 align:start position:0%
that is definitely one way to to look at
 
03:33:32.030 --> 03:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
the situation but by no regards or of
 
03:33:33.790 --> 03:33:33.800 align:start position:0%
course by the the film that we watch
 
03:33:36.309 --> 03:33:36.319 align:start position:0%
today does it present itself as the
 
03:33:38.389 --> 03:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
story does it present itself as the only
 
03:33:40.790 --> 03:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
story and Christina the co-writer and I
 
03:33:42.469 --> 03:33:42.479 align:start position:0%
are quite open about the fact that we
 
03:33:43.790 --> 03:33:43.800 align:start position:0%
came up with it all ourselves it's a
 
03:33:46.309 --> 03:33:46.319 align:start position:0%
wholly original narrative the idea it as
 
03:33:48.590 --> 03:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
I mentioned of course being that people
 
03:33:50.590 --> 03:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
who would watch this film and know not
 
03:33:52.950 --> 03:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
only our story but the story is told by
 
03:33:55.189 --> 03:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
generations of storytellers before us
 
03:33:57.030 --> 03:33:57.040 align:start position:0%
will hopefully Inspire them to want to
 
03:33:58.710 --> 03:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
become storytellers as well and be that
 
03:34:01.830 --> 03:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
through film or animation or music or
 
03:34:03.429 --> 03:34:03.439 align:start position:0%
poems or anything of the sort they'll
 
03:34:05.229 --> 03:34:05.239 align:start position:0%
find a way to express themselves
 
03:34:09.070 --> 03:34:09.080 align:start position:0%
creatively thank you representative sers
 
03:34:12.710 --> 03:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you madam chair um very good
 
03:34:15.150 --> 03:34:15.160 align:start position:0%
I can't even do stick figures thank you
 
03:34:18.110 --> 03:34:18.120 align:start position:0%
but in any case case um how would you
 
03:34:20.550 --> 03:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
feel if someone came forward a year or
 
03:34:22.910 --> 03:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
two or three or five for now and wanted
 
03:34:25.469 --> 03:34:25.479 align:start position:0%
to have their story out there instead of
 
03:34:29.950 --> 03:34:29.960 align:start position:0%
yours I mean so you're the only person
 
03:34:32.950 --> 03:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
we've seen on the story correct as far
 
03:34:35.870 --> 03:34:35.880 align:start position:0%
as the uh animated I suppose at present
 
03:34:38.070 --> 03:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
yes yeah so I'm just trying to figure
 
03:34:39.870 --> 03:34:39.880 align:start position:0%
what happens what happens as a committee
 
03:34:43.030 --> 03:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
or as a legislator you know five people
 
03:34:45.510 --> 03:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
come forward next year and they would
 
03:34:49.469 --> 03:34:49.479 align:start position:0%
like like they're animated up there I
 
03:34:52.550 --> 03:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
think that given the fact that the state
 
03:34:53.950 --> 03:34:53.960 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire has existed for as long
 
03:34:55.750 --> 03:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
as it has and the medium of Animation
 
03:34:57.670 --> 03:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
has existed for as long as it has and
 
03:35:00.389 --> 03:35:00.399 align:start position:0%
hasn't yet inspired a bill of this sort
 
03:35:02.990 --> 03:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
or a film of this sort might speak to
 
03:35:05.229 --> 03:35:05.239 align:start position:0%
some degree to the fact that people
 
03:35:07.550 --> 03:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
maybe haven't felt motivated to be able
 
03:35:10.110 --> 03:35:10.120 align:start position:0%
to bring this story or to reimagine this
 
03:35:13.269 --> 03:35:13.279 align:start position:0%
story into animation and while they are
 
03:35:14.990 --> 03:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
of course welcome to do so and of course
 
03:35:16.309 --> 03:35:16.319 align:start position:0%
welcome to come to the committee and ask
 
03:35:18.030 --> 03:35:18.040 align:start position:0%
them to reconsider their position on
 
03:35:20.590 --> 03:35:20.600 align:start position:0%
within the crystal Hills the idea of
 
03:35:23.309 --> 03:35:23.319 align:start position:0%
somebody watching the film and then of
 
03:35:25.110 --> 03:35:25.120 align:start position:0%
course coming forward to the committee
 
03:35:27.150 --> 03:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
again and asking for a reintroduction of
 
03:35:29.950 --> 03:35:29.960 align:start position:0%
a new idea would in my mind not be
 
03:35:31.950 --> 03:35:31.960 align:start position:0%
something that I'd discourage in fact it
 
03:35:33.590 --> 03:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
would be something I'd be incredibly
 
03:35:36.189 --> 03:35:36.199 align:start position:0%
encouraged by because again it's shown
 
03:35:38.229 --> 03:35:38.239 align:start position:0%
that this story and the fact that the
 
03:35:40.590 --> 03:35:40.600 align:start position:0%
state has chosen to recognize the merits
 
03:35:41.830 --> 03:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
of this story and the artists who've
 
03:35:44.950 --> 03:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
worked on it is a way to represent that
 
03:35:46.429 --> 03:35:46.439 align:start position:0%
this story is something that will make
 
03:35:48.070 --> 03:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
other people want to come up with their
 
03:35:50.229 --> 03:35:50.239 align:start position:0%
own ideas want to tell their own stories
 
03:35:51.990 --> 03:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
or as I mentioned uh to the chairwoman
 
03:35:53.590 --> 03:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
there anything of the
 
03:35:57.229 --> 03:35:57.239 align:start position:0%
sort thank you uh representative
 
03:36:00.070 --> 03:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
citec did you give any thought to
 
03:36:02.030 --> 03:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
incorporating the old woman of the
 
03:36:04.910 --> 03:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
mountain well I'm aware I'm aware of her
 
03:36:07.070 --> 03:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
and of course of of a dozen things up
 
03:36:08.550 --> 03:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
there in the whites of course there's
 
03:36:11.389 --> 03:36:11.399 align:start position:0%
the um whatever the mountain is that the
 
03:36:12.910 --> 03:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
resort is named after Lincoln or or
 
03:36:14.510 --> 03:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
whatever it is and there's the chicken
 
03:36:17.110 --> 03:36:17.120 align:start position:0%
farmer Rock in Newber or or or so on and
 
03:36:19.429 --> 03:36:19.439 align:start position:0%
so forth there's a dozen things of the
 
03:36:21.269 --> 03:36:21.279 align:start position:0%
sort in our state and again as I as I
 
03:36:23.349 --> 03:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
speak to the merits of how hopefully
 
03:36:25.349 --> 03:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
artists will watch this and be inspired
 
03:36:27.389 --> 03:36:27.399 align:start position:0%
to create their own narratives I I spoke
 
03:36:28.830 --> 03:36:28.840 align:start position:0%
to the representative there about
 
03:36:30.389 --> 03:36:30.399 align:start position:0%
perhaps new stories about the Old Man of
 
03:36:32.349 --> 03:36:32.359 align:start position:0%
the Mountain but that is of course not
 
03:36:34.590 --> 03:36:34.600 align:start position:0%
to Discount the fact that anything in
 
03:36:37.150 --> 03:36:37.160 align:start position:0%
our state can I believe be cause for a
 
03:36:39.070 --> 03:36:39.080 align:start position:0%
great sense of inspiration I'm sure that
 
03:36:40.750 --> 03:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
every single representative here can
 
03:36:41.910 --> 03:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
think about something in their own
 
03:36:43.550 --> 03:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
Hometown that they've heard a dozen
 
03:36:44.990 --> 03:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
stories about told a dozen different
 
03:36:47.950 --> 03:36:47.960 align:start position:0%
ways and as I've alluded to to be able
 
03:36:51.269 --> 03:36:51.279 align:start position:0%
to legitimize the idea of Animation
 
03:36:52.870 --> 03:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
being a medium in which these stories
 
03:36:55.349 --> 03:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
can be told so fully and with so much
 
03:36:57.790 --> 03:36:57.800 align:start position:0%
life is in a way to hopefully encourage
 
03:36:59.389 --> 03:36:59.399 align:start position:0%
people to look into their own town
 
03:37:01.309 --> 03:37:01.319 align:start position:0%
histories their own libraries and come
 
03:37:04.990 --> 03:37:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:07.309 --> 03:37:07.319 align:start position:0%
cool there are other questions from the
 
03:37:09.309 --> 03:37:09.319 align:start position:0%

department of uh natural and cultural
 
03:38:22.990 --> 03:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
resources it is also represented by the
 
03:38:26.630 --> 03:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire arts and tourism so when I
 
03:38:28.110 --> 03:38:28.120 align:start position:0%
come here with a heavy heart saying that
 
03:38:30.030 --> 03:38:30.040 align:start position:0%
we're in opposition to
 
03:38:34.189 --> 03:38:34.199 align:start position:0%
89 it's on the Merit of this being um in
 
03:38:36.990 --> 03:38:37.000 align:start position:0%
any way constructive for the fact that
 
03:38:40.229 --> 03:38:40.239 align:start position:0%
we're going into our 250th year and
 
03:38:42.550 --> 03:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
we're looking at our history of our
 
03:38:44.429 --> 03:38:44.439 align:start position:0%
state and the White Mountains are part
 
03:38:47.750 --> 03:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
of that um we had a meeting on uh
 
03:38:50.189 --> 03:38:50.199 align:start position:0%
January 13th and this bill was brought
 
03:38:54.070 --> 03:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
up and unanimously the commission uh
 
03:38:57.269 --> 03:38:57.279 align:start position:0%
felt it uh it really didn't uplift the
 
03:38:59.229 --> 03:38:59.239 align:start position:0%
uh the history of the state in the way
 
03:39:02.950 --> 03:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
that we expected that would be part of
 
03:39:04.830 --> 03:39:04.840 align:start position:0%
the Benchmark part of the the threshold
 
03:39:07.189 --> 03:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
that you'd have for an animated film for
 
03:39:09.309 --> 03:39:09.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire you're legislatively
 
03:39:11.590 --> 03:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
putting something in place which really
 
03:39:14.590 --> 03:39:14.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a lot of historical con uh
 
03:39:16.309 --> 03:39:16.319 align:start position:0%
content in it
 
03:39:18.950 --> 03:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
um people you know always talk about the
 
03:39:21.389 --> 03:39:21.399 align:start position:0%
White Mountains the crystal mountains
 
03:39:23.830 --> 03:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
this goes way back to the 1500s when
 
03:39:26.349 --> 03:39:26.359 align:start position:0%
early explorers were on the ocean and
 
03:39:28.469 --> 03:39:28.479 align:start position:0%
looking at the White Mountains and they
 
03:39:30.469 --> 03:39:30.479 align:start position:0%
were what were they were seeing was the
 
03:39:32.429 --> 03:39:32.439 align:start position:0%
micer and the granite reflecting the
 
03:39:35.229 --> 03:39:35.239 align:start position:0%
sunlight and that's how the name um you
 
03:39:37.189 --> 03:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
know Crystal mountains it had nothing to
 
03:39:39.070 --> 03:39:39.080 align:start position:0%
do with diamonds or crystals in the
 
03:39:40.630 --> 03:39:40.640 align:start position:0%
mountain it had to do with the
 
03:39:42.630 --> 03:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
reflection of the sunlight on the uh on
 
03:39:42.640 --> 03:39:43.389 align:start position:0%
reflection of the sunlight on the uh on
the

03:39:43.389 --> 03:39:43.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:39:46.710 --> 03:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
granite the commission felt that um
 
03:39:48.630 --> 03:39:48.640 align:start position:0%
there are so many indigenous stories
 
03:39:50.150 --> 03:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
some of which have actually been put
 
03:39:52.670 --> 03:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
into short films that talk about The
 
03:39:55.590 --> 03:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
Love Story and how uh Bill old man the
 
03:39:58.229 --> 03:39:58.239 align:start position:0%
mountain or his Old Stone Face is one of
 
03:40:00.710 --> 03:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
the other terms we've used uh became
 
03:40:03.990 --> 03:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
part of the mountain and how uh the
 
03:40:06.830 --> 03:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
mountain fell down in a love
 
03:40:10.870 --> 03:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
reconnection of the past uh so the story
 
03:40:12.550 --> 03:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
line is somewhat similar to in the
 
03:40:15.950 --> 03:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
Indigenous stories but uh the indigenous
 
03:40:19.309 --> 03:40:19.319 align:start position:0%
stories uh don't talk about uh iron
 
03:40:21.910 --> 03:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
mining uh they don't talk about diamonds
 
03:40:24.870 --> 03:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
in the mountains um which we felt was
 
03:40:27.150 --> 03:40:27.160 align:start position:0%
where this went too far this is a cute
 
03:40:29.269 --> 03:40:29.279 align:start position:0%
film but it doesn't really belong as
 
03:40:31.710 --> 03:40:31.720 align:start position:0%
something that's legislatively elevated
 
03:40:34.229 --> 03:40:34.239 align:start position:0%
to the level of State prominence it's an
 
03:40:37.070 --> 03:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
interesting artwork and I agree that uh
 
03:40:39.790 --> 03:40:39.800 align:start position:0%
was artsy and everybody uh loves the
 
03:40:43.150 --> 03:40:43.160 align:start position:0%
narration but these stories go way back
 
03:40:46.110 --> 03:40:46.120 align:start position:0%
and what this does it says a precedent
 
03:40:48.670 --> 03:40:48.680 align:start position:0%
that you're erasing the of a rich
 
03:40:50.950 --> 03:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
stories that have been you know
 
03:40:53.510 --> 03:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
documented all through the 1800s and all
 
03:40:56.429 --> 03:40:56.439 align:start position:0%
the way up into the into the 1900s there
 
03:40:58.550 --> 03:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
were stories about the White Mountains
 
03:41:00.590 --> 03:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
and then lo and behold when the mountain
 
03:41:04.550 --> 03:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
fell down uh a whole series of
 
03:41:06.110 --> 03:41:06.120 align:start position:0%
narratives came back from the Native
 
03:41:08.389 --> 03:41:08.399 align:start position:0%
American communities talking about how
 
03:41:12.550 --> 03:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
that's a re reuniting loved ones so this
 
03:41:14.830 --> 03:41:14.840 align:start position:0%
is this has been going on for a while in
 
03:41:17.229 --> 03:41:17.239 align:start position:0%
fact the alpinist magazine actually had
 
03:41:20.070 --> 03:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
a docu had a an article on the same
 
03:41:22.990 --> 03:41:23.000 align:start position:0%
narrative that was done in 2002 so this
 
03:41:26.630 --> 03:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
is nothing um like it's not a lack of
 
03:41:29.469 --> 03:41:29.479 align:start position:0%
some resources out there it's just the
 
03:41:30.870 --> 03:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
commission didn't feel this should have
 
03:41:32.710 --> 03:41:32.720 align:start position:0%
been elevated to the point of being a
 
03:41:34.910 --> 03:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
state film and the other ones that are
 
03:41:36.790 --> 03:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
out there and other narratives could be
 
03:41:39.429 --> 03:41:39.439 align:start position:0%
easily made into a a state movie if you
 
03:41:42.670 --> 03:41:42.680 align:start position:0%
wanted it to have some historical cons
 
03:41:45.229 --> 03:41:45.239 align:start position:0%
uh consistency with the uh the white
 
03:41:46.349 --> 03:41:46.359 align:start position:0%
mountains and why it's called the
 
03:41:48.950 --> 03:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
crystal mountains with that being said
 
03:41:50.590 --> 03:41:50.600 align:start position:0%
um we just don't want to see the
 
03:41:52.349 --> 03:41:52.359 align:start position:0%
indigenous narratives being totally
 
03:41:54.710 --> 03:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
erased and this is what will happen with
 
03:41:56.990 --> 03:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
this this will be elevated and be used
 
03:41:59.750 --> 03:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
and say well there is no no worthy
 
03:42:01.630 --> 03:42:01.640 align:start position:0%
stories from the indigenous perspective
 
03:42:03.990 --> 03:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
from the past and we we just think it's
 
03:42:05.510 --> 03:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
going in the wrong direction and
 
03:42:08.030 --> 03:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be done and it's a nice ey
 
03:42:10.469 --> 03:42:10.479 align:start position:0%
project I don't want to discredit that
 
03:42:13.229 --> 03:42:13.239 align:start position:0%
but it's just not appropriate at this
 
03:42:15.990 --> 03:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
level of legislation I just think it's
 
03:42:18.030 --> 03:42:18.040 align:start position:0%
so it's so low fruit it shouldn't even
 
03:42:21.349 --> 03:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
be put on as a a state short animated
 
03:42:27.269 --> 03:42:27.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:29.189 --> 03:42:29.199 align:start position:0%
perspective I'm not going to waste your
 
03:42:32.110 --> 03:42:32.120 align:start position:0%
time and repeat everything that he said
 
03:42:35.189 --> 03:42:35.199 align:start position:0%
so um uh but with that being said um as
 
03:42:37.550 --> 03:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
a tribe we do agree that the indigenous
 
03:42:40.110 --> 03:42:40.120 align:start position:0%
um perspective of the foundation of the
 
03:42:42.590 --> 03:42:42.600 align:start position:0%
old man in the mountain and of the White
 
03:42:45.870 --> 03:42:45.880 align:start position:0%
Mountains is an important um uh
 
03:42:49.990 --> 03:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
story to convey into the future um and
 
03:42:53.269 --> 03:42:53.279 align:start position:0%
with that I will say no more thank you
 
03:42:54.349 --> 03:42:54.359 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee
 
03:42:56.389 --> 03:42:56.399 align:start position:0%
representative sers yeah thank you madam
 
03:43:00.309 --> 03:43:00.319 align:start position:0%
chair so you're not opposed to having a
 
03:43:03.670 --> 03:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
state short film you just wanted to be
 
03:43:07.349 --> 03:43:07.359 align:start position:0%
more inclusive of the entire history
 
03:43:10.149 --> 03:43:10.159 align:start position:0%
from basically from when we settled or
 
03:43:12.830 --> 03:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
before we settled to today that that's
 
03:43:16.349 --> 03:43:16.359 align:start position:0%
correct um it's all about uh
 
03:43:17.710 --> 03:43:17.720 align:start position:0%
you know we're going for the time period
 
03:43:19.790 --> 03:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
250s is coming up we're looking at all
 
03:43:21.149 --> 03:43:21.159 align:start position:0%
of our history we're looking at all the
 
03:43:23.469 --> 03:43:23.479 align:start position:0%
all stories and there was so much Rich
 
03:43:24.950 --> 03:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
stuff written about the White Mountains
 
03:43:27.229 --> 03:43:27.239 align:start position:0%
in the 1800s and this is not one of
 
03:43:29.830 --> 03:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
those stories and we wish that it's just
 
03:43:31.590 --> 03:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
bad timing there could have been
 
03:43:34.149 --> 03:43:34.159 align:start position:0%
somebody out there that developed a very
 
03:43:37.670 --> 03:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
cute story which we already have um out
 
03:43:39.910 --> 03:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
there it's actually on YouTube there is
 
03:43:42.349 --> 03:43:42.359 align:start position:0%
a short animated story just like this
 
03:43:43.990 --> 03:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
that talks about it from the indigenous
 
03:43:46.510 --> 03:43:46.520 align:start position:0%
perspective and it all ties in because
 
03:43:49.070 --> 03:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
it does make sense how the Stone Face
 
03:43:50.830 --> 03:43:50.840 align:start position:0%
came on the mountain this one kind of
 
03:43:53.670 --> 03:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
alludes to he he was trapped and died in
 
03:43:56.550 --> 03:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
there but the the other narrative was uh
 
03:43:58.790 --> 03:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
a warrior stayed on the top of Canon
 
03:44:00.550 --> 03:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
Mountain waiting for his loved one to
 
03:44:03.790 --> 03:44:03.800 align:start position:0%
return all for a winter and the old man
 
03:44:05.990 --> 03:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
winter just destroyed him and made him
 
03:44:08.349 --> 03:44:08.359 align:start position:0%
part of the mountain so it's a more
 
03:44:10.550 --> 03:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
acceptable narrative because it had some
 
03:44:12.790 --> 03:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
kind of connection way back in the past
 
03:44:15.349 --> 03:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
and when it fell this narrative was that
 
03:44:18.149 --> 03:44:18.159 align:start position:0%
he was re reunited with his loved one
 
03:44:20.870 --> 03:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
who died just about the same time that
 
03:44:23.950 --> 03:44:23.960 align:start position:0%
he did so it it it made more sense that
 
03:44:25.429 --> 03:44:25.439 align:start position:0%
if there was ever going to be one it had
 
03:44:27.149 --> 03:44:27.159 align:start position:0%
to do with how the Stone Face got
 
03:44:29.269 --> 03:44:29.279 align:start position:0%
created in the first place not the other
 
03:44:32.469 --> 03:44:32.479 align:start position:0%
way around so if that makes sense thank
 
03:44:34.269 --> 03:44:34.279 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
03:44:37.950 --> 03:44:37.960 align:start position:0%
Bailey would it help if it was this is a
 
03:44:41.389 --> 03:44:41.399 align:start position:0%
bill to make it the state film would
 
03:44:44.830 --> 03:44:44.840 align:start position:0%
help if it was a state film allowing for
 
03:44:47.630 --> 03:44:47.640 align:start position:0%
other to come along I think if you were
 
03:44:50.710 --> 03:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
going to make it a one of U many state
 
03:44:53.269 --> 03:44:53.279 align:start position:0%
films then um then that a bill should be
 
03:44:55.990 --> 03:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
passed with all those State
 
03:44:59.309 --> 03:44:59.319 align:start position:0%
films together um right now if you pass
 
03:45:01.910 --> 03:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
this bill as it's written um it's going
 
03:45:04.469 --> 03:45:04.479 align:start position:0%
to erase the indigenous narrative and we
 
03:45:07.070 --> 03:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
can come back a year from now um because
 
03:45:09.349 --> 03:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
incc which is indigenous New Hampshire
 
03:45:11.349 --> 03:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
collaborative Collective um we have
 
03:45:13.710 --> 03:45:13.720 align:start position:0%
funding we can we can create an animated
 
03:45:16.469 --> 03:45:16.479 align:start position:0%
film for you within six months and and
 
03:45:18.630 --> 03:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
have it in front of this in order for
 
03:45:21.710 --> 03:45:21.720 align:start position:0%
the 250th um but we want something
 
03:45:23.710 --> 03:45:23.720 align:start position:0%
that's historically accurate that
 
03:45:26.309 --> 03:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
pertains to the state and that has um
 
03:45:29.630 --> 03:45:29.640 align:start position:0%
long long longevity um to the foundation
 
03:45:33.189 --> 03:45:33.199 align:start position:0%
of um New Hampshire um and this story as
 
03:45:34.990 --> 03:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
um as you already heard was recently
 
03:45:37.750 --> 03:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
created and it doesn't have the history
 
03:45:39.469 --> 03:45:39.479 align:start position:0%
um that we would be hoping for within a
 
03:45:39.479 --> 03:45:40.229 align:start position:0%
um that we would be hoping for within a
state

03:45:40.229 --> 03:45:40.239 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:45:44.149 --> 03:45:44.159 align:start position:0%
film thank you I I think it also gives a
 
03:45:46.510 --> 03:45:46.520 align:start position:0%
disserving with diamonds in the in Canon
 
03:45:48.030 --> 03:45:48.040 align:start position:0%
mountain or anywhere in the White
 
03:45:49.870 --> 03:45:49.880 align:start position:0%
Mountains I don't know if that's going
 
03:45:53.070 --> 03:45:53.080 align:start position:0%
to bur on anybody to think that way but
 
03:45:55.510 --> 03:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
it's just it's a bad construct it had to
 
03:45:57.070 --> 03:45:57.080 align:start position:0%
do with micro it had nothing to do with
 
03:45:59.830 --> 03:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
diamonds no
 
03:46:02.870 --> 03:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
crystals there other questions from the
 
03:46:04.990 --> 03:46:05.000 align:start position:0%

represent Davis he had the bill
somewhere

03:53:52.469 --> 03:53:52.479 align:start position:0%
somewhere

um

03:54:04.110 --> 03:54:04.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:06.149 --> 03:54:06.159 align:start position:0%
does do you have a motion or does
 
03:54:08.550 --> 03:54:08.560 align:start position:0%
someone have a motion uh yes Madam chair
 
03:54:10.349 --> 03:54:10.359 align:start position:0%
um I would make an motion of an
 
03:54:13.149 --> 03:54:13.159 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate on House Bill 89
 
03:54:15.830 --> 03:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
second okay I did see them
 
03:54:18.429 --> 03:54:18.439 align:start position:0%
move thank you representative Schmidt
 
03:54:20.309 --> 03:54:20.319 align:start position:0%
for sharing your
 
03:54:23.189 --> 03:54:23.199 align:start position:0%
experience so the motion is inexpedient
 
03:54:26.030 --> 03:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
to legislate by representative Lon
 
03:54:27.590 --> 03:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
second by representative Schmidt do you
 
03:54:29.309 --> 03:54:29.319 align:start position:0%
to speak to your motion uh yes thank you
 
03:54:31.830 --> 03:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
madam chair I think this is a wonderful
 
03:54:34.030 --> 03:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
beautifully done story um done in
 
03:54:35.510 --> 03:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
animation it's beautiful that there is
 
03:54:38.349 --> 03:54:38.359 align:start position:0%
no AI used in it because um it's
 
03:54:40.389 --> 03:54:40.399 align:start position:0%
beautiful to still see hand done
 
03:54:42.630 --> 03:54:42.640 align:start position:0%
animation um I'm just very concerned
 
03:54:43.950 --> 03:54:43.960 align:start position:0%
that if we have this as the state
 
03:54:45.750 --> 03:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
animation film a lot of people are going
 
03:54:49.070 --> 03:54:49.080 align:start position:0%
to see this as the history when it's one
 
03:54:51.229 --> 03:54:51.239 align:start position:0%
interpretation and we have long-standing
 
03:54:55.070 --> 03:54:55.080 align:start position:0%
Traditions um through the ab abanaki and
 
03:54:57.710 --> 03:54:57.720 align:start position:0%
I would not want to erase that history
 
03:54:59.910 --> 03:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
by by promoting this to be our state
 
03:55:03.429 --> 03:55:03.439 align:start position:0%
animated film um I do want to commend Mr
 
03:55:06.269 --> 03:55:06.279 align:start position:0%
Hansen on his amazing work um and I do
 
03:55:08.710 --> 03:55:08.720 align:start position:0%
want to say that us recommending this to
 
03:55:10.750 --> 03:55:10.760 align:start position:0%
not become the state animated film is no
 
03:55:12.710 --> 03:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
knock against the wonderful work he has
 
03:55:14.870 --> 03:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
done the soundtrack that they had in the
 
03:55:17.149 --> 03:55:17.159 align:start position:0%
amazing narration but just simply that
 
03:55:18.269 --> 03:55:18.279 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that we're not
 
03:55:21.110 --> 03:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
erasing um long-standing history by
 
03:55:23.030 --> 03:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
promoting this film this
 
03:55:25.550 --> 03:55:25.560 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint thank you representative
 
03:55:29.950 --> 03:55:29.960 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam chair so uh I'm
 
03:55:31.990 --> 03:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
troubled by several aspects of the film
 
03:55:34.070 --> 03:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
number one is that it's a complete
 
03:55:36.189 --> 03:55:36.199 align:start position:0%
fiction and has nothing to do with the
 
03:55:39.630 --> 03:55:39.640 align:start position:0%
reality of uh of uh the old man of the
 
03:55:43.070 --> 03:55:43.080 align:start position:0%
mount and so forth um I I watched the
 
03:55:45.149 --> 03:55:45.159 align:start position:0%
film very carefully about three weeks
 
03:55:48.950 --> 03:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
ago uh and uh it's it's just not
 
03:55:51.990 --> 03:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
appropriated appropriate uh especially
 
03:55:53.750 --> 03:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
given the fact that it has no
 
03:55:56.269 --> 03:55:56.279 align:start position:0%
competition I mean we we'd be selecting
 
03:55:58.630 --> 03:55:58.640 align:start position:0%
one out of one and and I don't think
 
03:56:01.189 --> 03:56:01.199 align:start position:0%
that's fair to to other artists who may
 
03:56:03.429 --> 03:56:03.439 align:start position:0%
be thinking in terms of something having
 
03:56:04.910 --> 03:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the Old Man of the
 
03:56:07.710 --> 03:56:07.720 align:start position:0%
Mountain so uh itl is the correct Motion
 
03:56:09.710 --> 03:56:09.720 align:start position:0%
in my view thank you thank you does
 
03:56:11.510 --> 03:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
anyone else have a comment uh yes
 
03:56:13.870 --> 03:56:13.880 align:start position:0%
represent long and then sitech uh I like
 
03:56:16.269 --> 03:56:16.279 align:start position:0%
to repres presid Bailey's proposal to
 
03:56:19.309 --> 03:56:19.319 align:start position:0%
make it one to make it a state animated
 
03:56:22.269 --> 03:56:22.279 align:start position:0%
film instead of the state animated film
 
03:56:24.630 --> 03:56:24.640 align:start position:0%
so uh if anyone would like
 
03:56:29.149 --> 03:56:29.159 align:start position:0%
to uh guess I could offer an
 
03:56:31.590 --> 03:56:31.600 align:start position:0%
amendment uh so I'd like to offer an
 
03:56:32.950 --> 03:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
amendment to make it excuse me the
 
03:56:36.389 --> 03:56:36.399 align:start position:0%
motion is inexpedient to legislate and
 
03:56:38.269 --> 03:56:38.279 align:start position:0%
we can't offer an amendment at this
 
03:56:40.429 --> 03:56:40.439 align:start position:0%
point but you certainly can talk about
 
03:56:42.670 --> 03:56:42.680 align:start position:0%
what you think would have been better so
 
03:56:45.950 --> 03:56:45.960 align:start position:0%
if it had been a State animated film uh
 
03:56:49.349 --> 03:56:49.359 align:start position:0%
I would vote um against lling it but I
 
03:56:53.070 --> 03:56:53.080 align:start position:0%
will be voting for itl uh because I
 
03:56:56.030 --> 03:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
don't want to see other voices
 
03:56:58.910 --> 03:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
excluded thank you representative
 
03:57:01.550 --> 03:57:01.560 align:start position:0%
scitech I I have a different perspective
 
03:57:03.670 --> 03:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
I have
 
03:57:06.790 --> 03:57:06.800 align:start position:0%
generally a lot of trouble with State
 
03:57:08.630 --> 03:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
anything where
 
03:57:13.030 --> 03:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
is because I feel these kinds of things
 
03:57:15.950 --> 03:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
semi ceremonial things tend to
 
03:57:18.590 --> 03:57:18.600 align:start position:0%
trivialize the legislature we're voting
 
03:57:22.389 --> 03:57:22.399 align:start position:0%
on taxation land use abortion rights of
 
03:57:27.229 --> 03:57:27.239 align:start position:0%
people and then we bring in this and I
 
03:57:29.990 --> 03:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
need to keep an open mind on it but my
 
03:57:32.510 --> 03:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
my bias is that I'm not in favor in
 
03:57:35.750 --> 03:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
general and I'm saying this because it
 
03:57:40.710 --> 03:57:40.720 align:start position:0%
will apply in other um other legislation
 
03:57:42.469 --> 03:57:42.479 align:start position:0%
likely to come before the committee
 
03:57:46.189 --> 03:57:46.199 align:start position:0%
that's all thank you okay anyone else
 
03:57:49.830 --> 03:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:53.590 --> 03:57:53.600 align:start position:0%
concerns okay in that case the motion is
 
03:57:55.670 --> 03:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
index me to legislate by representative
 
03:57:58.229 --> 03:57:58.239 align:start position:0%

consent and we still have a couple of
 
03:58:59.550 --> 03:58:59.560 align:start position:0%
minutes Madam chair can we um have a
 
03:59:02.030 --> 03:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
discussion about a possible Amendment on
 
03:59:05.030 --> 03:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
210 I want to float an idea before I go
 
03:59:06.750 --> 03:59:06.760 align:start position:0%
through the process of paperwork and all
 
03:59:10.309 --> 03:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
that jazz 210 reminding me is Commission
 
03:59:12.349 --> 03:59:12.359 align:start position:0%
on the flag the commission on the flag
 
03:59:15.640 --> 03:59:15.650 align:start position:0%
so um think thinking back
 
03:59:15.650 --> 03:59:17.269 align:start position:0%
so um think thinking back
[Music]

03:59:17.269 --> 03:59:17.279 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:59:21.110 --> 03:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
to and in no way am I comparing
 
03:59:23.189 --> 03:59:23.199 align:start position:0%
these the flag of the State of New
 
03:59:24.309 --> 03:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to the symbol of the New
 
03:59:26.590 --> 03:59:26.600 align:start position:0%
England Patriots but when you know in
 
03:59:28.030 --> 03:59:28.040 align:start position:0%
the late 80s the New England Patriots
 
03:59:29.229 --> 03:59:29.239 align:start position:0%
when they went to Rebrand themselves
 
03:59:31.429 --> 03:59:31.439 align:start position:0%
went through a process of of opening
 
03:59:33.469 --> 03:59:33.479 align:start position:0%
that up to submission and and they had a
 
03:59:34.950 --> 03:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
procedure and a process of narrowing
 
03:59:37.550 --> 03:59:37.560 align:start position:0%
that down and for those of us that are
 
03:59:40.389 --> 03:59:40.399 align:start position:0%
old enough to remember that they they
 
03:59:43.389 --> 03:59:43.399 align:start position:0%
did it right so looking at the the
 
03:59:46.990 --> 03:59:47.000 align:start position:0%
legislation that we have here um one of
 
03:59:50.510 --> 03:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
the things that jumped out at me was you
 
03:59:55.429 --> 03:59:55.439 align:start position:0%
know there seemed to be reluctancy on um
 
04:00:00.110 --> 04:00:00.120 align:start position:0%
lines 24 through 27 as far as the the
 
04:00:02.070 --> 04:00:02.080 align:start position:0%
proposals and the commission's
 
04:00:03.990 --> 04:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
potentially submitting a design and all
 
04:00:09.070 --> 04:00:09.080 align:start position:0%
that so my thought process here is to uh
 
04:00:10.710 --> 04:00:10.720 align:start position:0%
have the commission develop criteria and
 
04:00:12.910 --> 04:00:12.920 align:start position:0%
a mechanism to accept designs submitted
 
04:00:14.790 --> 04:00:14.800 align:start position:0%
by New Hampshire citizen
 
04:00:16.229 --> 04:00:16.239 align:start position:0%
the commission will determine the length
 
04:00:18.269 --> 04:00:18.279 align:start position:0%
of time for submission commission will
 
04:00:21.030 --> 04:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
narrow down the submissions to 50 let's
 
04:00:22.269 --> 04:00:22.279 align:start position:0%
I mean God only knows how money they're
 
04:00:24.189 --> 04:00:24.199 align:start position:0%
going to receive uh commission will
 
04:00:25.790 --> 04:00:25.800 align:start position:0%
determine as to how the final 50
 
04:00:27.269 --> 04:00:27.279 align:start position:0%
submissions will be narrowed down and
 
04:00:28.990 --> 04:00:29.000 align:start position:0%
the commission will hold a public
 
04:00:31.429 --> 04:00:31.439 align:start position:0%
hearing once the 50 final submissions
 
04:00:32.349 --> 04:00:32.359 align:start position:0%
have been
 
04:00:34.910 --> 04:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
chosen the 50 is just a number I picked
 
04:00:37.630 --> 04:00:37.640 align:start position:0%
but but basically the concept here is
 
04:00:40.870 --> 04:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
that I mean if we're going to have a a
 
04:00:45.110 --> 04:00:45.120 align:start position:0%
reboot of the of our state flag
 
04:00:47.590 --> 04:00:47.600 align:start position:0%
let's bring this let's open this up to
 
04:00:50.189 --> 04:00:50.199 align:start position:0%
the citizens of the state to submit to
 
04:00:53.110 --> 04:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
this commission ideas and in
 
04:00:57.070 --> 04:00:57.080 align:start position:0%
designs and and just go through that
 
04:01:01.389 --> 04:01:01.399 align:start position:0%
process um rather than rather than
 
04:01:03.830 --> 04:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
having a commission that's doing a lot
 
04:01:07.149 --> 04:01:07.159 align:start position:0%
of work that may or may not be fruitful
 
04:01:10.189 --> 04:01:10.199 align:start position:0%
and it seems to not
 
04:01:14.030 --> 04:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
be popular with the committee
 
04:01:14.040 --> 04:01:15.590 align:start position:0%
be popular with the committee
okay

04:01:15.590 --> 04:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:01:17.590 --> 04:01:17.600 align:start position:0%
represento I agree with representative
 
04:01:20.790 --> 04:01:20.800 align:start position:0%
Pearson I think to solicit designs from
 
04:01:22.670 --> 04:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
um the public is a much more logical
 
04:01:24.910 --> 04:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
approach and it's what's been um um
 
04:01:26.950 --> 04:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
attempted in other states like Utah and
 
04:01:28.870 --> 04:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
in Minnesota that have changed their
 
04:01:32.630 --> 04:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
Flags um quite successfully so I would
 
04:01:34.990 --> 04:01:35.000 align:start position:0%
support um changing it so it can only
 
04:01:37.349 --> 04:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
solicit rather than design the flag
 
04:01:40.030 --> 04:01:40.040 align:start position:0%
representative Howard thank you as a
 
04:01:43.389 --> 04:01:43.399 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor on HB 210 I am in complete
 
04:01:45.149 --> 04:01:45.159 align:start position:0%
agreement with Representatives Pearson
 
04:01:47.870 --> 04:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
and tibo I think that this is a
 
04:01:50.389 --> 04:01:50.399 align:start position:0%
completely uh acceptable Amendment and
 
04:01:54.550 --> 04:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
would uh help provide an opportunity for
 
04:01:57.389 --> 04:01:57.399 align:start position:0%
public input uh that may not necessarily
 
04:02:00.149 --> 04:02:00.159 align:start position:0%
be guaranteed thank you represent
 
04:02:04.269 --> 04:02:04.279 align:start position:0%
scitech uh I'm not sure yet uh sounds um
 
04:02:06.870 --> 04:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
reasonable enough I I'm thinking along
 
04:02:09.030 --> 04:02:09.040 align:start position:0%
the line that Betsy Ross didn't need a
 
04:02:12.189 --> 04:02:12.199 align:start position:0%
commission um but the other thing is if
 
04:02:14.429 --> 04:02:14.439 align:start position:0%
to entertain this don't put a limit on
 
04:02:17.389 --> 04:02:17.399 align:start position:0%
it if they're bad designs they can just
 
04:02:19.030 --> 04:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
winow them out in a hurry but it just
 
04:02:21.309 --> 04:02:21.319 align:start position:0%
looks funny to put a limit that's all
 
04:02:23.349 --> 04:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
the the the concept of going down to 50
 
04:02:25.030 --> 04:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
was just a for
 
04:02:30.110 --> 04:02:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:32.349 --> 04:02:32.359 align:start position:0%
if the only the only thing the only
 
04:02:33.710 --> 04:02:33.720 align:start position:0%
thing is with that with representes
 
04:02:35.790 --> 04:02:35.800 align:start position:0%
hitech is that we always run the risk
 
04:02:37.590 --> 04:02:37.600 align:start position:0%
and and thinking back to some of the
 
04:02:39.429 --> 04:02:39.439 align:start position:0%
other events that we've done here is if
 
04:02:41.510 --> 04:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
the elementary schools jump on this we
 
04:02:44.590 --> 04:02:44.600 align:start position:0%
will have thousands of submissions so
 
04:02:47.110 --> 04:02:47.120 align:start position:0%
you're losing my vote you know okay uh
 
04:02:49.630 --> 04:02:49.640 align:start position:0%
but I I gotta lay it out in the reality
 
04:02:51.189 --> 04:02:51.199 align:start position:0%
of what what could potentially come of
 
04:02:53.870 --> 04:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
this all
 
04:02:56.830 --> 04:02:56.840 align:start position:0%
right I I'd like to comment that when we
 
04:02:59.870 --> 04:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
considered the flag change last year
 
04:03:01.630 --> 04:03:01.640 align:start position:0%
there were some people who just didn't
 
04:03:03.429 --> 04:03:03.439 align:start position:0%
like the particular design we were
 
04:03:06.550 --> 04:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
voting on but there was a very large
 
04:03:08.790 --> 04:03:08.800 align:start position:0%
group within the house and within the
 
04:03:11.429 --> 04:03:11.439 align:start position:0%
committee that was not convinced that
 
04:03:14.189 --> 04:03:14.199 align:start position:0%
there was any need to change the flag at
 
04:03:17.309 --> 04:03:17.319 align:start position:0%
all there may be Vex olical reasons it's
 
04:03:20.149 --> 04:03:20.159 align:start position:0%
not perfect or even ideal but on the
 
04:03:23.229 --> 04:03:23.239 align:start position:0%
other hand it's it's been our flag for
 
04:03:27.590 --> 04:03:27.600 align:start position:0%
better than 300 years so sorry no 200
 
04:03:29.149 --> 04:03:29.159 align:start position:0%
better than 200
 
04:03:29.159 --> 04:03:30.910 align:start position:0%
better than 200
years

04:03:30.910 --> 04:03:30.920 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:03:33.750 --> 04:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
so so your your submission will be the
 
04:03:35.750 --> 04:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
current state
 
04:03:38.149 --> 04:03:38.159 align:start position:0%
flag I'm not going to bother I don't
 
04:03:40.830 --> 04:03:40.840 align:start position:0%
think it's worth our our time to change
 
04:03:42.710 --> 04:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
something that has served us perfectly
 
04:03:46.830 --> 04:03:46.840 align:start position:0%
well regardless of some some
 
04:03:48.870 --> 04:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
individual's carping about how it's not
 
04:03:50.710 --> 04:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
as good as it ought to be well there's a
 
04:03:52.429 --> 04:03:52.439 align:start position:0%
whole lot of other things we have that
 
04:03:54.349 --> 04:03:54.359 align:start position:0%
are not as good as they ought to be but
 
04:03:57.710 --> 04:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
they work and I'm not in I'm personally
 
04:03:59.750 --> 04:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
not willing to invest my time and energy
 
04:04:01.870 --> 04:04:01.880 align:start position:0%
and fixing them and I think there is a
 
04:04:03.790 --> 04:04:03.800 align:start position:0%
fair number of Representatives who feel
 
04:04:07.870 --> 04:04:07.880 align:start position:0%
the same so um I'm just warning you that
 
04:04:10.550 --> 04:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
if you bring an amendment it's going to
 
04:04:12.870 --> 04:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
me with rousing indifference by a lot of
 
04:04:12.880 --> 04:04:14.309 align:start position:0%
me with rousing indifference by a lot of
people

04:04:14.309 --> 04:04:14.319 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:04:15.349 --> 04:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
and that's why we're having this
 
04:04:18.389 --> 04:04:18.399 align:start position:0%
discussion right now okay well it's your
 
04:04:21.710 --> 04:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:26.030 --> 04:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
choice represent yes chair mire maybe we
 
04:04:28.189 --> 04:04:28.199 align:start position:0%
might take a straw vote could we take a
 
04:04:28.199 --> 04:04:29.950 align:start position:0%
might take a straw vote could we take a
straw

04:04:29.950 --> 04:04:29.960 align:start position:0%
straw
 
04:04:33.110 --> 04:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
vote uh we we have half a minute so yes
 
04:04:34.990 --> 04:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
what's what do you want to vote
 
04:04:38.349 --> 04:04:38.359 align:start position:0%
on whether or not we want to pass the
 
04:04:44.070 --> 04:04:44.080 align:start position:0%
Bill okay as is or amended either way
 
04:04:46.630 --> 04:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
yeah either way either way either way
 
04:04:49.229 --> 04:04:49.239 align:start position:0%
those in favor raise your hand in favor
 
04:04:52.469 --> 04:04:52.479 align:start position:0%
of what passing a bill in some form in
 
04:04:55.189 --> 04:04:55.199 align:start position:0%
some form sure two
 
04:04:59.950 --> 04:04:59.960 align:start position:0%
three four five six those
 
04:05:04.790 --> 04:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
opposed two three four five six and then
 
04:05:06.389 --> 04:05:06.399 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of other that makes
 
04:05:08.229 --> 04:05:08.239 align:start position:0%
everything and there's a couple of other
 
04:05:10.110 --> 04:05:10.120 align:start position:0%
people who don't care enough to even
 
04:05:12.990 --> 04:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
vote so I would say it's at your own
 
04:05:15.269 --> 04:05:15.279 align:start position:0%
risk sure
 
04:05:18.469 --> 04:05:18.479 align:start position:0%

04:05:54.070 --> 04:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
Londoner I'm here today to sponsor this
 
04:05:55.269 --> 04:05:55.279 align:start position:0%
bill that would change the New Hampshire
 
04:05:57.750 --> 04:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
state flag this bill came to me because
 
04:06:00.429 --> 04:06:00.439 align:start position:0%
of a young man sitting next to me Andrew
 
04:06:02.309 --> 04:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
I first met Andrew when he came to the
 
04:06:04.550 --> 04:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
lary town council meeting back in
 
04:06:06.030 --> 04:06:06.040 align:start position:0%
January of
 
04:06:08.189 --> 04:06:08.199 align:start position:0%
2024 since that time this bill has
 
04:06:10.510 --> 04:06:10.520 align:start position:0%
developed into what you see here today
 
04:06:12.149 --> 04:06:12.159 align:start position:0%
Andrew has been involved in the entire
 
04:06:12.159 --> 04:06:14.030 align:start position:0%
Andrew has been involved in the entire
process

04:06:14.030 --> 04:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:06:16.229 --> 04:06:16.239 align:start position:0%
he spoke with all the co-sponsors asked
 
04:06:19.189 --> 04:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
them all to sign on he also had two
 
04:06:21.189 --> 04:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
rejections of co-sponsors that he dealt
 
04:06:24.590 --> 04:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
with um however that did not stop him he
 
04:06:26.750 --> 04:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
found two
 
04:06:29.469 --> 04:06:29.479 align:start position:0%
more uh some of you will like his flag
 
04:06:30.990 --> 04:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
design of the left profile and some do
 
04:06:33.309 --> 04:06:33.319 align:start position:0%
not so Andrew today has a handout that
 
04:06:35.189 --> 04:06:35.199 align:start position:0%
shows both sides of the flag one with
 
04:06:38.309 --> 04:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
the left profile one with the right
 
04:06:40.750 --> 04:06:40.760 align:start position:0%
profile Andrews brought photos with him
 
04:06:42.469 --> 04:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
and he's going to explain the difference
 
04:06:44.670 --> 04:06:44.680 align:start position:0%
in his preference and why he chose a
 
04:06:44.680 --> 04:06:45.870 align:start position:0%
in his preference and why he chose a
certain

04:06:45.870 --> 04:06:45.880 align:start position:0%
certain
 
04:06:47.950 --> 04:06:47.960 align:start position:0%
profile uh my committee today is an
 
04:06:50.389 --> 04:06:50.399 align:start position:0%
executive session at 2:00 so I've got to

04:07:18.630 --> 04:07:18.640 align:start position:0%
prop we're much less formal here than in
 
04:07:21.229 --> 04:07:21.239 align:start position:0%

04:07:45.109 --> 04:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
04:07:48.149 --> 04:07:48.159 align:start position:0%
176 submitted for me by representative
 
04:07:50.750 --> 04:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
Dunn proposing my design for the state
 
04:07:53.550 --> 04:07:53.560 align:start position:0%
flag of New Hampshire I served as New
 
04:07:56.309 --> 04:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's 2024 governor for a day and
 
04:07:58.149 --> 04:07:58.159 align:start position:0%
I'm a member of the North American
 
04:08:01.149 --> 04:08:01.159 align:start position:0%
vexillological Association which studies
 
04:08:03.590 --> 04:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
Flags the people of New Hampshire helped
 
04:08:06.229 --> 04:08:06.239 align:start position:0%
me decide what to put on this flag this
 
04:08:08.469 --> 04:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
speech will tell you why I think the
 
04:08:11.030 --> 04:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
current state flag should be changed and
 
04:08:14.630 --> 04:08:14.640 align:start position:0%
why these symbols are on my flag firstly
 
04:08:16.710 --> 04:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
the current state flag of New Hampshire
 
04:08:19.109 --> 04:08:19.119 align:start position:0%
basically consists of the state seal on
 
04:08:21.790 --> 04:08:21.800 align:start position:0%
a blue background commonly called a seal
 
04:08:24.550 --> 04:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
on a bed sheet the New Hampshire flag is
 
04:08:27.429 --> 04:08:27.439 align:start position:0%
one of 27 that use their state seal or
 
04:08:30.349 --> 04:08:30.359 align:start position:0%
code of arms and their flag and one of
 
04:08:33.030 --> 04:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
24 flags with a blue
 
04:08:33.040 --> 04:08:34.710 align:start position:0%
24 flags with a blue
background

04:08:34.710 --> 04:08:34.720 align:start position:0%
background
 
04:08:38.030 --> 04:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
second the state flag is just liked by
 
04:08:40.550 --> 04:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
both vexillologists and New Hampshire
 
04:08:42.670 --> 04:08:42.680 align:start position:0%
citizens as well as being historically
 
04:08:42.680 --> 04:08:43.990 align:start position:0%
citizens as well as being historically
inaccurate

04:08:43.990 --> 04:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
inaccurate
 
04:08:46.870 --> 04:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
in the 2001 State and provincial flag
 
04:08:50.149 --> 04:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
survey by the North American Vex olical
 
04:08:52.950 --> 04:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
Association New Hampshire ranked
 
04:08:55.870 --> 04:08:55.880 align:start position:0%
41st or in other words the 10th worst
 
04:08:58.950 --> 04:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
flag in the survey a quiz taken over
 
04:09:01.910 --> 04:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
400,000 times ranked the New Hampshire
 
04:09:04.429 --> 04:09:04.439 align:start position:0%
flag as America's second most
 
04:09:08.149 --> 04:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
forgettable state flag California's flag
 
04:09:10.950 --> 04:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
ranked as America's most memorable state
 
04:09:14.710 --> 04:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
flag it is easily recognized iable like
 
04:09:17.590 --> 04:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
California's flag is easily recognizable
 
04:09:20.630 --> 04:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
this unique design will be a substantial
 
04:09:24.189 --> 04:09:24.199 align:start position:0%
Improvement in 1909 when our state flag
 
04:09:27.349 --> 04:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
was adopted there were at the same time
 
04:09:30.149 --> 04:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
at least two bills both to put the old
 
04:09:32.469 --> 04:09:32.479 align:start position:0%
man the mountain on the state flag
 
04:09:34.550 --> 04:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
people have wanted the old man on the
 
04:09:37.429 --> 04:09:37.439 align:start position:0%
state flag from the very beginning
 
04:09:40.070 --> 04:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
thirdly The Old Man of the Mountain is a
 
04:09:42.229 --> 04:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
distinct symbol to both new hampshirites
 
04:09:45.149 --> 04:09:45.159 align:start position:0%
and people Nation wide The Old Man of
 
04:09:46.710 --> 04:09:46.720 align:start position:0%
the Mountain is synonymous with New
 
04:09:49.590 --> 04:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it is on the state emblem
 
04:09:52.109 --> 04:09:52.119 align:start position:0%
license plates State root signs and the
 
04:09:55.469 --> 04:09:55.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire state quor in 1850 the

famous Nathaniel Hawthorne who wrote
 
04:10:00.229 --> 04:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
books like The Scarlet Letter wrote a
 
04:10:02.990 --> 04:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
story called The Great Stone Face about
 
04:10:05.510 --> 04:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
the Old Man of the Mountain armato live
 
04:10:08.510 --> 04:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
for your die which was famously ritten
 
04:10:12.030 --> 04:10:12.040 align:start position:0%
by General John Stark in 1809 is also a
 
04:10:14.189 --> 04:10:14.199 align:start position:0%
synonymous symbol also Al featured on
 
04:10:16.630 --> 04:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
the state emblem and license plates
 
04:10:18.990 --> 04:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
there are also Nine Stars representing
 
04:10:20.630 --> 04:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire being the ninth state
 
04:10:24.070 --> 04:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
admitted to the union so for well over
 
04:10:27.229 --> 04:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
175 years the people of New Hampshire
 
04:10:29.269 --> 04:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
have held the Old Man of the Mountain
 
04:10:31.830 --> 04:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
and Live Free or Die close to their
 
04:10:34.550 --> 04:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
hearts I have spoken with flag experts
 
04:10:37.269 --> 04:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
and shown them my design they seem to
 
04:10:38.790 --> 04:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
like the Old Man of the Mountain and
 
04:10:41.510 --> 04:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
Live Free or Die a simple design with
 
04:10:44.630 --> 04:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
few colors and no States seal the
 
04:10:47.590 --> 04:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
vexillologists would like a simple flag
 
04:10:49.389 --> 04:10:49.399 align:start position:0%
although none of these vexillologists
 
04:10:51.590 --> 04:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
are from New Hampshire they were seded
 
04:10:53.790 --> 04:10:53.800 align:start position:0%
after I educated them on the symbolism
 
04:10:56.469 --> 04:10:56.479 align:start position:0%
of the old man and Live Free or Die the
 
04:10:58.109 --> 04:10:58.119 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire that I've talked
 
04:11:00.950 --> 04:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
to like the flag that incorporates The
 
04:11:04.229 --> 04:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
Old Man and Live Free or Die I've talked
 
04:11:06.790 --> 04:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
to lots of people in New Hampshire and
 
04:11:09.030 --> 04:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
the people that I've talked to and have
 
04:11:11.910 --> 04:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
signed my petition want this flag design
 
04:11:13.349 --> 04:11:13.359 align:start position:0%
I have talked to people that are not
 
04:11:15.149 --> 04:11:15.159 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire and even they
 
04:11:17.910 --> 04:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
identify Live Free or Die an Old Man of
 
04:11:17.920 --> 04:11:18.590 align:start position:0%
identify Live Free or Die an Old Man of
the

04:11:18.590 --> 04:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:11:21.070 --> 04:11:21.080 align:start position:0%
Mountain the people of New Hampshire are
 
04:11:23.550 --> 04:11:23.560 align:start position:0%
very proud of both Live Free or Die and
 
04:11:26.950 --> 04:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
the old man furthermore two states have
 
04:11:28.950 --> 04:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
recently changed their Sia bed sheet
 
04:11:32.389 --> 04:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
Flags Utah and Minnesota I think that
 
04:11:34.349 --> 04:11:34.359 align:start position:0%
the design I'm proposing would be a
 
04:11:36.790 --> 04:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
unique symbol of New Hampshire I think
 
04:11:38.790 --> 04:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
it brings people together in these times
 
04:11:41.790 --> 04:11:41.800 align:start position:0%
of dispute you may wonder how many
 
04:11:43.269 --> 04:11:43.279 align:start position:0%
people visit the beautiful white
 
04:11:45.030 --> 04:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
mountains at which the old man was
 
04:11:47.550 --> 04:11:47.560 align:start position:0%
hustled well according to the forest
 
04:11:49.389 --> 04:11:49.399 align:start position:0%
service the White Mountains receives
 
04:11:54.109 --> 04:11:54.119 align:start position:0%
upwards of 6 million visitors annually
 
04:11:56.109 --> 04:11:56.119 align:start position:0%
there is a field of white on my flag to
 
04:11:59.070 --> 04:11:59.080 align:start position:0%
represent the White Mountains a large
 
04:12:01.149 --> 04:12:01.159 align:start position:0%
majority of these visitors understand
 
04:12:02.790 --> 04:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
the symbolism that the old man
 
04:12:05.349 --> 04:12:05.359 align:start position:0%
represents for New Hampshire and as far
 
04:12:07.910 --> 04:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
as Live Free or Die General Stark wrote
 
04:12:09.910 --> 04:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
this as a toast to the Battle of
 
04:12:12.229 --> 04:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
Bennington a battle which helped America
 
04:12:15.149 --> 04:12:15.159 align:start position:0%
on its quest for dependence the F quote
 
04:12:17.429 --> 04:12:17.439 align:start position:0%
is actually Live Free or Die death is
 
04:12:20.389 --> 04:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
not the greatest of evils New Hampshire
 
04:12:22.189 --> 04:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
is a state that fought to secure the
 
04:12:24.149 --> 04:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
freedoms we all enjoy
 
04:12:27.109 --> 04:12:27.119 align:start position:0%
today this flag would give the old man
 
04:12:29.670 --> 04:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
representation on flag folds across the
 
04:12:32.389 --> 04:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
state and putting Live Free or Die on
 
04:12:34.309 --> 04:12:34.319 align:start position:0%
the flag serves as a commemoration to
 
04:12:36.990 --> 04:12:37.000 align:start position:0%
our state's history and the freedoms we
 
04:12:40.149 --> 04:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
all enjoy today joining them together on
 
04:12:43.469 --> 04:12:43.479 align:start position:0%
my flag is what the people want I the
 
04:12:45.590 --> 04:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
support of former Governor Kur Alderman
 
04:12:47.750 --> 04:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
will Stewart and former Republican
 
04:12:50.910 --> 04:12:50.920 align:start position:0%
nominee for congress Lily Tang Williams
 
04:12:54.790 --> 04:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
HB 176 was also showcased by citizens
 
04:12:59.429 --> 04:12:59.439 align:start position:0%
count on their podcast $100 plus mileage
 
04:13:01.550 --> 04:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
and it is also being used as a lesson in
 
04:13:04.229 --> 04:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
Civics by a New Hampshire homeschooling
 
04:13:06.710 --> 04:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
Association some people like my design
 
04:13:09.229 --> 04:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
as it is but I'm told some people have
 
04:13:11.830 --> 04:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
support for my flag with silhouette as
 
04:13:14.109 --> 04:13:14.119 align:start position:0%
it appears on license place plates I
 
04:13:15.429 --> 04:13:15.439 align:start position:0%
just want to bring it to everyone's
 
04:13:17.269 --> 04:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
attention that by darkening the
 
04:13:19.830 --> 04:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
silhouette on the back side of the flag
 
04:13:21.990 --> 04:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
the same as the front side of the flag
 
04:13:23.830 --> 04:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
each side of the flag will show the old
 
04:13:26.389 --> 04:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
man as it was in real life from one
 
04:13:29.070 --> 04:13:29.080 align:start position:0%
perspective you see it this
 
04:13:32.630 --> 04:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
way and from another perspective you see
 
04:13:35.070 --> 04:13:35.080 align:start position:0%
it that way which is exactly what 6
 
04:13:37.469 --> 04:13:37.479 align:start position:0%
million people a year would have seen as
 
04:13:41.349 --> 04:13:41.359 align:start position:0%
they travel north and south on
 
04:13:44.710 --> 04:13:44.720 align:start position:0%
i93 that is why I argue that if New
 
04:13:46.750 --> 04:13:46.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's flag is changed it needs to
 
04:13:49.109 --> 04:13:49.119 align:start position:0%
be a better and more effective flag to
 
04:13:51.870 --> 04:13:51.880 align:start position:0%
represent New Hampshire everyone what do
 
04:13:53.189 --> 04:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
you think of when you think of New
 
04:13:55.790 --> 04:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire what I think about is the old
 
04:13:58.189 --> 04:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
man and Live Free or Die both great
 
04:14:01.149 --> 04:14:01.159 align:start position:0%
symbols of the great Granite State I
 
04:14:02.590 --> 04:14:02.600 align:start position:0%
thank the chair and committee members

for much of the same reasons that I
 
04:15:23.670 --> 04:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
brought before you this morning the flag
 
04:15:25.670 --> 04:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
is poorly designed it's not just a few
 
04:15:27.189 --> 04:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
individuals that think that it's a
 
04:15:28.950 --> 04:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
number of people that have said that
 
04:15:31.149 --> 04:15:31.159 align:start position:0%
based off of the facts that the flag is
 
04:15:33.229 --> 04:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
poorly designed you couldn't pick it out
 
04:15:34.950 --> 04:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
from a hall of flags in the middle of
 
04:15:37.070 --> 04:15:37.080 align:start position:0%
the United States Congress you go to the
 
04:15:38.309 --> 04:15:38.319 align:start position:0%
United States
 
04:15:40.830 --> 04:15:40.840 align:start position:0%
Congress good luck finding the flag it's
 
04:15:43.269 --> 04:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
uh very hard to find amidst all the
 
04:15:46.429 --> 04:15:46.439 align:start position:0%
others that are blue and have the seal
 
04:15:48.349 --> 04:15:48.359 align:start position:0%
on top of them there are so many things
 
04:15:50.670 --> 04:15:50.680 align:start position:0%
in this state that are so distinct and I
 
04:15:52.910 --> 04:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
think that uh Mr flockton has brought
 
04:15:54.750 --> 04:15:54.760 align:start position:0%
together and put together a very
 
04:15:57.469 --> 04:15:57.479 align:start position:0%
well-designed flag that shows what could
 
04:16:00.349 --> 04:16:00.359 align:start position:0%
come if we opened up uh commissioned up
 
04:16:02.750 --> 04:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
to to examples
 
04:16:05.510 --> 04:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
um all you have to do here today is vote
 
04:16:06.990 --> 04:16:07.000 align:start position:0%
no one's asking you to serve on a
 
04:16:08.990 --> 04:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
commission or take your time to serve on
 
04:16:10.630 --> 04:16:10.640 align:start position:0%
a commission and I think it's a little
 
04:16:13.590 --> 04:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
flippant to say otherwise so so I would
 
04:16:17.950 --> 04:16:17.960 align:start position:0%
hope that uh this work could be done by
 
04:16:20.910 --> 04:16:20.920 align:start position:0%
the committee meaning vote to approve
 
04:16:23.429 --> 04:16:23.439 align:start position:0%
either this or the other commission bill
 
04:16:25.269 --> 04:16:25.279 align:start position:0%
so that the representatives who want to
 
04:16:27.950 --> 04:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
serve on the commission and who have uh
 
04:16:29.510 --> 04:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
pledged that they would spend their time
 
04:16:31.189 --> 04:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
to serve on this commission could do the
 
04:16:33.309 --> 04:16:33.319 align:start position:0%
work that you said that you didn't want
 
04:16:36.750 --> 04:16:36.760 align:start position:0%
to do um with that I'd just like to end
 
04:16:39.229 --> 04:16:39.239 align:start position:0%
by saying this is an example of good
 
04:16:40.630 --> 04:16:40.640 align:start position:0%
governance you know the fact that a
 
04:16:42.910 --> 04:16:42.920 align:start position:0%
13-year-old can come here and speak
 
04:16:43.870 --> 04:16:43.880 align:start position:0%
before the
 
04:16:45.990 --> 04:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
legislature that can't happen in every
 
04:16:47.469 --> 04:16:47.479 align:start position:0%
country and it can't happen in every
 
04:16:49.189 --> 04:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
state and it's the beauty of New
 
04:16:51.950 --> 04:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where we can have a young guy
 
04:16:55.790 --> 04:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
with uh an idea bring that idea to his
 
04:16:57.349 --> 04:16:57.359 align:start position:0%
representatives and have them bring it
 
04:17:00.870 --> 04:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
forward to the committee and I think
 
04:17:02.670 --> 04:17:02.680 align:start position:0%
it's just a great affirmation of the
 
04:17:04.550 --> 04:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
open process that we have here in New
 
04:17:07.910 --> 04:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the Civic engagement that
 
04:17:11.510 --> 04:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
our citizens have even at the age of 13
 
04:17:13.389 --> 04:17:13.399 align:start position:0%
if some representative at
 
04:17:15.349 --> 04:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
13 if you know Jonah wheeler the nerd
 
04:17:18.429 --> 04:17:18.439 align:start position:0%
that I was if some representative at 13
 
04:17:19.990 --> 04:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
years old said to me oh you know you
 
04:17:21.870 --> 04:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
should come come to the legislature and
 
04:17:25.189 --> 04:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
get involved uh I was I was going to say
 
04:17:26.389 --> 04:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
I might be here a little earlier but I
 
04:17:29.030 --> 04:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
was here as early as I could
 
04:17:32.030 --> 04:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
but I would definitely have been
 
04:17:34.550 --> 04:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
involved from that age on I would have
 
04:17:36.070 --> 04:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
felt that the government was listening
 
04:17:39.389 --> 04:17:39.399 align:start position:0%
to me and so I think it's just thank you
 
04:17:41.429 --> 04:17:41.439 align:start position:0%
for being so respectful to Mr flockton
 
04:17:44.510 --> 04:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
and to have him come here today and
 
04:17:46.510 --> 04:17:46.520 align:start position:0%
congratulations to representative Dunn
 
04:17:48.269 --> 04:17:48.279 align:start position:0%
for being a good representative that
 
04:17:51.269 --> 04:17:51.279 align:start position:0%
listens to his constituents so thank you
 
04:17:53.349 --> 04:17:53.359 align:start position:0%
madam chair I would hope that you vote
 
04:17:54.990 --> 04:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
to approve this legislation and the
 
04:17:57.510 --> 04:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
other one the commit Commission because
 
04:17:59.429 --> 04:17:59.439 align:start position:0%
there are Representatives that are
 
04:18:01.429 --> 04:18:01.439 align:start position:0%
willing to do the work that you said
 
04:18:03.870 --> 04:18:03.880 align:start position:0%
that you weren't and are willing to do
 
04:18:06.309 --> 04:18:06.319 align:start position:0%
that commission to get it done so thank
 
04:18:07.990 --> 04:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
you very much for those of you that were
 
04:18:11.070 --> 04:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
respectful and looked diligently at uh
 
04:18:13.790 --> 04:18:13.800 align:start position:0%
Mr flockton as he testified because it
 
04:18:15.630 --> 04:18:15.640 align:start position:0%
takes a lot for a 13-year-old to come
 
04:18:17.590 --> 04:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
here and testify and it means a lot for
 
04:18:20.269 --> 04:18:20.279 align:start position:0%
him to have adults with the stature that
 
04:18:23.070 --> 04:18:23.080 align:start position:0%
you have look at him in the eye with
 
04:18:25.590 --> 04:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
respect and listen to him while he
 
04:18:27.550 --> 04:18:27.560 align:start position:0%
testified here today so thank you so
 
04:18:28.630 --> 04:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
much Madam
 
04:18:31.149 --> 04:18:31.159 align:start position:0%
chairman actually I would have to than
 
04:18:33.910 --> 04:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
thank you and Miss and representative D
 
04:18:36.990 --> 04:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
and Mr flockton because I had I believe
 
04:18:39.389 --> 04:18:39.399 align:start position:0%
five fourth grade classes come visiting
 
04:18:43.109 --> 04:18:43.119 align:start position:0%
the state house this fall and I told all
 
04:18:45.429 --> 04:18:45.439 align:start position:0%
of them about this bill and invited them
 
04:18:49.349 --> 04:18:49.359 align:start position:0%
to read it and testify because I felt
 
04:18:51.109 --> 04:18:51.119 align:start position:0%
that your average fourth grade class
 
04:18:53.950 --> 04:18:53.960 align:start position:0%
would be able to give a reasonable
 
04:18:56.149 --> 04:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
comment on this bill it's much easier
 
04:18:58.349 --> 04:18:58.359 align:start position:0%
than talking about pensions for example
 
04:19:00.590 --> 04:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
that's right come to the pension
 
04:19:02.070 --> 04:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
subcommittee you
 
04:19:05.790 --> 04:19:05.800 align:start position:0%
know no their eyes glazed over before I
 
04:19:08.550 --> 04:19:08.560 align:start position:0%
finish the word thank you very much
 
04:19:10.269 --> 04:19:10.279 align:start position:0%

Kelly hi my name is Linda Kelly I am
 
04:19:28.910 --> 04:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
Andrew flockton mom um I'm speaking in
 
04:19:32.950 --> 04:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
support of HB 176 to change the St state
 
04:19:35.429 --> 04:19:35.439 align:start position:0%
flag um Andrew's decision to try to
 
04:19:37.389 --> 04:19:37.399 align:start position:0%
change the state flag and his subsequent
 
04:19:39.670 --> 04:19:39.680 align:start position:0%
designs as a result of extensive
 
04:19:41.469 --> 04:19:41.479 align:start position:0%
research as well as getting people's
 
04:19:44.109 --> 04:19:44.119 align:start position:0%
opinions he is a ex theologist and
 
04:19:46.750 --> 04:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
member of Nava and has also followed the
 
04:19:49.750 --> 04:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
processes of changing the Minnesota and
 
04:19:52.349 --> 04:19:52.359 align:start position:0%
Utah state flags he's truly driven in
 
04:19:54.710 --> 04:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
his efforts and personally
 
04:19:56.870 --> 04:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
inspiring I agree that New Hampshire
 
04:19:58.389 --> 04:19:58.399 align:start position:0%
definitely needs to replace the current
 
04:20:00.830 --> 04:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
state flag and replace it with something
 
04:20:03.269 --> 04:20:03.279 align:start position:0%
that truly represents our uniqueness
 
04:20:05.790 --> 04:20:05.800 align:start position:0%
what better way than with two instantly
 
04:20:08.269 --> 04:20:08.279 align:start position:0%
recognizable New Hampshire
 
04:20:13.389 --> 04:20:13.399 align:start position:0%
symbols um and also to add um
 
04:20:15.910 --> 04:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
one of the only real issues um seems to
 
04:20:15.920 --> 04:20:16.990 align:start position:0%
one of the only real issues um seems to
be

04:20:16.990 --> 04:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:20:19.469 --> 04:20:19.479 align:start position:0%
ambivalence but a good flag could also
 
04:20:21.149 --> 04:20:21.159 align:start position:0%
bring in dorus
 
04:20:25.149 --> 04:20:25.159 align:start position:0%

04:30:10.950 --> 04:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:10.960 --> 04:30:40.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:30:40.910 --> 04:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:40.920 --> 04:31:10.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:31:10.910 --> 04:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:10.920 --> 04:31:40.830 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:31:40.830 --> 04:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:21.670 --> 04:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:27.269 --> 04:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:29.990 --> 04:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
minutes well we can't stop time be done
 
04:32:32.309 --> 04:32:32.319 align:start position:0%
in the chamber so that's right we can't
 
04:32:35.389 --> 04:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
we have to deal with it all right
 
04:32:40.910 --> 04:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
so on there entering executive session
 
04:32:46.469 --> 04:32:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:49.349 --> 04:32:49.359 align:start position:0%
motion in that case I will move in
 
04:32:52.229 --> 04:32:52.239 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate I'll
 
04:32:57.429 --> 04:32:57.439 align:start position:0%
second all right and my comment is not
 
04:33:00.309 --> 04:33:00.319 align:start position:0%
to say that we don't like this flag
 
04:33:03.950 --> 04:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
design but that we are not or at least I
 
04:33:06.029 --> 04:33:06.039 align:start position:0%
am not convinced we need to make a
 
04:33:09.750 --> 04:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
change we have a commission that will be
 
04:33:12.750 --> 04:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
setting up the process to make a change
 
04:33:13.949 --> 04:33:13.959 align:start position:0%
if it is
 
04:33:18.910 --> 04:33:18.920 align:start position:0%
necessary and this design can C
 
04:33:21.470 --> 04:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
certainly be considered by that
 
04:33:23.910 --> 04:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
commission it's a valid submission it
 
04:33:26.750 --> 04:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
meets the requirements but I think
 
04:33:29.109 --> 04:33:29.119 align:start position:0%
there's enough
 
04:33:32.670 --> 04:33:32.680 align:start position:0%
concern about the changing the flag at
 
04:33:35.990 --> 04:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
all and also about the qualifications of
 
04:33:38.949 --> 04:33:38.959 align:start position:0%
this committee to judge the quality of a
 
04:33:43.390 --> 04:33:43.400 align:start position:0%
flag um that I'm recommending in itl
 
04:33:46.910 --> 04:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
represent gr thank you madam chair I'm
 
04:33:49.070 --> 04:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
particularly um concerned about our
 
04:33:51.670 --> 04:33:51.680 align:start position:0%
ability to approve a flag
 
04:33:55.750 --> 04:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
design because um it's it's one and we
 
04:33:57.390 --> 04:33:57.400 align:start position:0%
don't know what other
 
04:34:02.789 --> 04:34:02.799 align:start position:0%
potential um designs we could have and I
 
04:34:04.949 --> 04:34:04.959 align:start position:0%
even though a lot of people may think
 
04:34:08.150 --> 04:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
our flag is boring I particularly like
 
04:34:10.709 --> 04:34:10.719 align:start position:0%
our flag and I don't see why we need to
 
04:34:12.949 --> 04:34:12.959 align:start position:0%
change it so maybe I mean the minority
 
04:34:17.349 --> 04:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
but um I'd like the commission that was
 
04:34:20.830 --> 04:34:20.840 align:start position:0%
discussed earlier to establish a process
 
04:34:24.789 --> 04:34:24.799 align:start position:0%
and establish one where everyone that is
 
04:34:26.949 --> 04:34:26.959 align:start position:0%
involved or wants to look at Finance the
 
04:34:29.150 --> 04:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
flag designs or want to submit a flag
 
04:34:31.590 --> 04:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
design can do
 
04:34:35.070 --> 04:34:35.080 align:start position:0%
so representative Tio I I would agree
 
04:34:37.830 --> 04:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
with you chair one MC McGuire in that I
 
04:34:40.990 --> 04:34:41.000 align:start position:0%
think that um we should explore other
 
04:34:43.109 --> 04:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
designs rather than than just one I
 
04:34:44.349 --> 04:34:44.359 align:start position:0%
think this would be a great one to
 
04:34:46.510 --> 04:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
submit for the commission to consider
 
04:34:48.709 --> 04:34:48.719 align:start position:0%
but my other issue is just with the
 
04:34:50.470 --> 04:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
statutory language that we have in front
 
04:34:53.750 --> 04:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
of us right now there's it's not very
 
04:34:55.709 --> 04:34:55.719 align:start position:0%
specific in the dimensions of certain
 
04:34:58.029 --> 04:34:58.039 align:start position:0%
aspects of the flag and for that reason
 
04:35:00.310 --> 04:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
it could be hard to reproduce I mean if
 
04:35:02.629 --> 04:35:02.639 align:start position:0%
we want to talk about biological history
 
04:35:04.590 --> 04:35:04.600 align:start position:0%
um when the American flag was first
 
04:35:07.390 --> 04:35:07.400 align:start position:0%
passed with the original flag code no
 
04:35:09.670 --> 04:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
one really knew exactly how to design it
 
04:35:11.429 --> 04:35:11.439 align:start position:0%
so you look back and you see all these
 
04:35:13.349 --> 04:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
old old American flags that look wildly
 
04:35:16.150 --> 04:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
inconsistent from each other so my fear
 
04:35:17.990 --> 04:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
is that without some clear statutory
 
04:35:19.470 --> 04:35:19.480 align:start position:0%
language a similar thing could happen
 
04:35:22.029 --> 04:35:22.039 align:start position:0%
where you have 50 different vendors
 
04:35:24.949 --> 04:35:24.959 align:start position:0%
probably selling to tourists who have
 
04:35:26.470 --> 04:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
wildly different New Hampshire state
 
04:35:29.109 --> 04:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
flags I think we need something that is
 
04:35:31.230 --> 04:35:31.240 align:start position:0%
um able to be consistently replicated
 
04:35:33.551 --> 04:35:33.561 align:start position:0%
and that needs to be reflected in the
 
04:35:35.990 --> 04:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
statute thank you that's interesting
 
04:35:36.000 --> 04:35:37.750 align:start position:0%
statute thank you that's interesting
representative

04:35:37.750 --> 04:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:35:42.109 --> 04:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
CCH I guess I'm out of Step once again
 
04:35:45.390 --> 04:35:45.400 align:start position:0%
um I am not I to the extent that I can I
 
04:35:47.230 --> 04:35:47.240 align:start position:0%
will never vote for anything that's got
 
04:35:49.590 --> 04:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
the Old Man of the Mountain on it it's a
 
04:35:51.869 --> 04:35:51.879 align:start position:0%
pile of rocks it has nothing to do with
 
04:35:55.590 --> 04:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
personal Integrity value worth anything
 
04:35:58.789 --> 04:35:58.799 align:start position:0%
that represents real value of car of
 
04:36:00.750 --> 04:36:00.760 align:start position:0%
character uh if you want to have
 
04:36:03.150 --> 04:36:03.160 align:start position:0%
something on the flag That's Unique
 
04:36:06.109 --> 04:36:06.119 align:start position:0%
Mount Washington the highest wind ever
 
04:36:09.230 --> 04:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
recorded the highest peak east of the
 
04:36:12.349 --> 04:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
Mississippi um I guess I could go along
 
04:36:14.551 --> 04:36:14.561 align:start position:0%
with that but it isn't anything to do
 
04:36:17.869 --> 04:36:17.879 align:start position:0%
with this flag it's just it's been gone
 
04:36:21.070 --> 04:36:21.080 align:start position:0%
since 2003 it never represented anything
 
04:36:25.070 --> 04:36:25.080 align:start position:0%
to me again I dare guess I'm out of Step
 
04:36:27.150 --> 04:36:27.160 align:start position:0%
but that's how I feel okay
 
04:36:29.150 --> 04:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
representative Lam uh thank you madam
 
04:36:31.789 --> 04:36:31.799 align:start position:0%
chair and I I do want to thank Mr
 
04:36:33.510 --> 04:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
flockton for coming up with this design
 
04:36:34.949 --> 04:36:34.959 align:start position:0%
and bringing it Forward I really
 
04:36:37.551 --> 04:36:37.561 align:start position:0%
appreciate that um that said when I was
 
04:36:40.150 --> 04:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
his age I lived in California with that
 
04:36:42.470 --> 04:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
flag that's the most recognizable state
 
04:36:44.390 --> 04:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
flag with a bear that you can no longer
 
04:36:47.310 --> 04:36:47.320 align:start position:0%
find in the state um I actually was very
 
04:36:48.949 --> 04:36:48.959 align:start position:0%
happy when I moved to New Hampshire that
 
04:36:50.510 --> 04:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
we had what I considered such a
 
04:36:53.150 --> 04:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
dignified flag with the seal on the on
 
04:36:54.830 --> 04:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
the bed sheet of blue and while there's
 
04:36:57.390 --> 04:36:57.400 align:start position:0%
people who oppose it I actually like it
 
04:36:59.709 --> 04:36:59.719 align:start position:0%
and uh it's it's an issue of me liking
 
04:37:02.150 --> 04:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
the current flag uh more than anything
 
04:37:04.670 --> 04:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
else uh and so I think that's why it's
 
04:37:05.910 --> 04:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
great that we'll be moving towards a
 
04:37:07.789 --> 04:37:07.799 align:start position:0%
commission where we can figure out if
 
04:37:09.310 --> 04:37:09.320 align:start position:0%
the people do want to replace the flag
 
04:37:11.310 --> 04:37:11.320 align:start position:0%
or not but my vote is I like the current
 
04:37:13.670 --> 04:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
flag flag and I appreciate the work that
 
04:37:15.789 --> 04:37:15.799 align:start position:0%
uh Mr flockton put into this um it's
 
04:37:19.189 --> 04:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
just a design difference so thank you
 
04:37:19.199 --> 04:37:20.150 align:start position:0%
just a design difference so thank you
anyone

04:37:20.150 --> 04:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
04:37:22.590 --> 04:37:22.600 align:start position:0%
else I'd like to mention that in some
 
04:37:25.349 --> 04:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
things in life boring is good and I'm
 
04:37:28.269 --> 04:37:28.279 align:start position:0%
not sure if flags are one of them but it
 
04:37:30.789 --> 04:37:30.799 align:start position:0%
might well be the case any other
 
04:37:33.029 --> 04:37:33.039 align:start position:0%
comments no I just like to thank that
 
04:37:34.789 --> 04:37:34.799 align:start position:0%
you pointed out once again that you are
 
04:37:34.799 --> 04:37:36.429 align:start position:0%
you pointed out once again that you are
an

04:37:36.429 --> 04:37:36.439 align:start position:0%
an
 
04:37:39.150 --> 04:37:39.160 align:start position:0%
engineer yes thank you representative
 
04:37:42.590 --> 04:37:42.600 align:start position:0%
Pearson my AR my artist judgment is not
 
04:37:43.949 --> 04:37:43.959 align:start position:0%
to be relied
 
04:37:46.629 --> 04:37:46.639 align:start position:0%
on and that's another another good
 
04:37:50.310 --> 04:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
reason to not vote for this in this
 
04:37:53.551 --> 04:37:53.561 align:start position:0%
committee because as we found out today
 
04:37:56.949 --> 04:37:56.959 align:start position:0%
it's just chalk full of Engineers and
 
04:38:00.670 --> 04:38:00.680 align:start position:0%
our our design artistic design judgment
 
04:38:03.150 --> 04:38:03.160 align:start position:0%
is suspect to say the
 
04:38:05.310 --> 04:38:05.320 align:start position:0%
least anyone
 
04:38:08.789 --> 04:38:08.799 align:start position:0%
else all right seeing none the motion is
 
04:38:11.189 --> 04:38:11.199 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate on House Bill
 
04:38:14.310 --> 04:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
one 76 and the clerk can call the
 
04:38:19.830 --> 04:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
role Vice chair Lon yes clerk votes yes
 
04:38:21.750 --> 04:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson looking forward
 
04:38:24.310 --> 04:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
to seeing it in the commission
 
04:38:27.230 --> 04:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative

okay
 
04:39:12.029 --> 04:39:12.039 align:start position:0%
um see what do we have here uh 16
 
04:39:14.070 --> 04:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
12 122
 
04:39:17.910 --> 04:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
122 okay the motion passes
 
04:39:22.029 --> 04:39:22.039 align:start position:0%
12-2 is there any objection to
 
04:39:24.551 --> 04:39:24.561 align:start position:0%
consent okay seeing none we'll put this
 
04:39:26.590 --> 04:39:26.600 align:start position:0%
on Con on
 
04:39:26.600 --> 04:39:28.910 align:start position:0%
on Con on

consent
 
04:39:32.551 --> 04:39:32.561 align:start position:0%
and we will deal with the other issue of
 
04:39:35.670 --> 04:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
the flag after we get representative
 
04:39:38.390 --> 04:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
Pearson's um
 
04:39:41.910 --> 04:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment Mr um Mr Howard is is going to
 
04:39:45.150 --> 04:39:45.160 align:start position:0%

04:39:48.310 --> 04:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
a co-sponsor it was it's better better
 
04:39:50.788 --> 04:39:50.798 align:start position:0%
op that would be the Optics would be
 
04:39:52.910 --> 04:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
better yes thank you representative
 
04:39:57.670 --> 04:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
Howard we have five minutes all right I
 
04:40:00.830 --> 04:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
would while we are in executive session
 
04:40:04.350 --> 04:40:04.360 align:start position:0%
I have an amendment to House Bill
 
04:40:07.030 --> 04:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
598 which is a study
 
04:40:09.868 --> 04:40:09.878 align:start position:0%
committee to look at the data gathered
 
04:40:12.190 --> 04:40:12.200 align:start position:0%
by the state
 
04:40:15.150 --> 04:40:15.160 align:start position:0%
based on comments from the
 
04:40:19.350 --> 04:40:19.360 align:start position:0%
committee I've amended it to call for
 
04:40:21.910 --> 04:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
four members of the House rather than
 
04:40:25.070 --> 04:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
three at least one being a member of the
 
04:40:29.350 --> 04:40:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:33.510 --> 04:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
Senate and then to add to the duties of
 
04:40:37.350 --> 04:40:37.360 align:start position:0%
the committee to protect personal
 
04:40:39.788 --> 04:40:39.798 align:start position:0%
identifiable information because there's
 
04:40:43.830 --> 04:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:48.830 --> 04:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
um uh state government so I'm
 
04:40:52.150 --> 04:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
moving Amendment
 
04:40:55.190 --> 04:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
0310 to House Bill
 
04:41:00.230 --> 04:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:00.240 --> 04:41:02.230 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:41:02.230 --> 04:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:41:05.430 --> 04:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
and as I was saying in the introduction
 
04:41:08.230 --> 04:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
this fixes some of the concerns we had
 
04:41:13.430 --> 04:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
with the basic Bill and and
 
04:41:17.708 --> 04:41:17.718 align:start position:0%
um but it still includes the chart that
 
04:41:21.990 --> 04:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
a a committee to act look at the data
 
04:41:25.910 --> 04:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
because we have a very great deal of
 
04:41:30.030 --> 04:41:30.040 align:start position:0%
data that in many cases we find is not
 
04:41:34.390 --> 04:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
totally accessible to other departments
 
04:41:39.070 --> 04:41:39.080 align:start position:0%
or to the public and it ought to be so
 
04:41:42.350 --> 04:41:42.360 align:start position:0%
um representative l uh thank you madam
 
04:41:44.270 --> 04:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
chair I I think that this is very very
 
04:41:45.948 --> 04:41:45.958 align:start position:0%
important to look at this data I think
 
04:41:47.550 --> 04:41:47.560 align:start position:0%
that being able to have it in a
 
04:41:50.708 --> 04:41:50.718 align:start position:0%
consistent um evalu consistent format
 
04:41:53.350 --> 04:41:53.360 align:start position:0%
will be good and um previously serving
 
04:41:54.590 --> 04:41:54.600 align:start position:0%
on the Health and Human Services
 
04:41:56.628 --> 04:41:56.638 align:start position:0%
committee we dealt with some of the data
 
04:41:58.868 --> 04:41:58.878 align:start position:0%
needs and some of the data information
 
04:42:01.270 --> 04:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
and making sure that we're prioritizing
 
04:42:03.670 --> 04:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
um protecting personally identifiable
 
04:42:05.310 --> 04:42:05.320 align:start position:0%
information is consistent with what's
 
04:42:06.910 --> 04:42:06.920 align:start position:0%
been done through other parts of the
 
04:42:09.390 --> 04:42:09.400 align:start position:0%
state with it and data and I think that
 
04:42:11.708 --> 04:42:11.718 align:start position:0%
it's a very good move um and so I
 
04:42:14.990 --> 04:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
support this amendment in the Bill okay
 
04:42:17.990 --> 04:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
any representative
 
04:42:20.390 --> 04:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
Vera thank you I was the one who brought
 
04:42:22.510 --> 04:42:22.520 align:start position:0%
up the objection to the First Amendment
 
04:42:25.430 --> 04:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate having my concerns
 
04:42:27.390 --> 04:42:27.400 align:start position:0%
addressed in the amendment I'll be
 
04:42:30.750 --> 04:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
supporting it however I do want to say
 
04:42:33.550 --> 04:42:33.560 align:start position:0%
that it says with at least one member of
 
04:42:35.230 --> 04:42:35.240 align:start position:0%
the minority party I would have felt
 
04:42:38.230 --> 04:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
more comfortable with two it says at
 
04:42:40.750 --> 04:42:40.760 align:start position:0%
least one at least one so you could
 
04:42:44.390 --> 04:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
technically put one um but I'll take the
 
04:42:47.550 --> 04:42:47.560 align:start position:0%
amendment and I appreciate the
 
04:42:51.510 --> 04:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
um personal data also considered so I'll
 
04:42:53.628 --> 04:42:53.638 align:start position:0%
support the amendment I thank the chair
 
04:42:55.470 --> 04:42:55.480 align:start position:0%
for bringing forth the
 
04:43:00.310 --> 04:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you yes I didn't want to
 
04:43:04.190 --> 04:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
say to mostly because I wanted to make
 
04:43:06.270 --> 04:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
sure that the members were knew
 
04:43:08.948 --> 04:43:08.958 align:start position:0%
something about data and how to use it
 
04:43:11.430 --> 04:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
and I don't know who is there I know
 
04:43:14.390 --> 04:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
there are members of both parties so if
 
04:43:15.510 --> 04:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
we can
 
04:43:18.310 --> 04:43:18.320 align:start position:0%
get I mean if if it turns out we get
 
04:43:20.550 --> 04:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
three qualified Democrats that want to
 
04:43:21.990 --> 04:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
serve on this commission I'm not going
 
04:43:24.310 --> 04:43:24.320 align:start position:0%
to argue with it I don't think this
 
04:43:28.868 --> 04:43:28.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:31.150 --> 04:43:31.160 align:start position:0%
all R
 
04:43:34.590 --> 04:43:34.600 align:start position:0%
ferson uh I got a question in reference
 
04:43:39.708 --> 04:43:39.718 align:start position:0%
to this the expiration date of this
 
04:43:42.230 --> 04:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
committee did I
 
04:43:45.270 --> 04:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
help me out if I missed it
 
04:43:48.590 --> 04:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
um because we have a report
 
04:43:51.390 --> 04:43:51.400 align:start position:0%
requirement yes the there is a
 
04:43:55.150 --> 04:43:55.160 align:start position:0%
preliminary report this November a final
 
04:43:59.190 --> 04:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
one next November this is not a statute
 
04:44:01.868 --> 04:44:01.878 align:start position:0%
this is in chapter law and I have been
 
04:44:04.070 --> 04:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
assured that once the final report is in
 
04:44:09.070 --> 04:44:09.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:12.190 --> 04:44:12.200 align:start position:0%
okay much as I hate chap law that is in
 
04:44:15.830 --> 04:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
fact a convenience in this
 
04:44:19.230 --> 04:44:19.240 align:start position:0%
case anyone
 
04:44:22.190 --> 04:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
else all right in that case the motion
 
04:44:25.590 --> 04:44:25.600 align:start position:0%

with Amendment on House Bill
 
04:45:18.920 --> 04:45:23.350 align:start position:0%
with Amendment on House Bill
598

04:45:23.350 --> 04:45:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:26.788 --> 04:45:26.798 align:start position:0%
second nothing left to
 
04:45:26.798 --> 04:45:30.190 align:start position:0%
second nothing left to
say

04:45:30.190 --> 04:45:30.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:33.270 --> 04:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
representative so I have to
 
04:45:39.070 --> 04:45:39.080 align:start position:0%
um I was encouraged when I saw the bill
 
04:45:41.590 --> 04:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
itself but
 
04:45:43.430 --> 04:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to be supporting the bill
 
04:45:45.350 --> 04:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
as amended it has nothing to do with the
 
04:45:48.670 --> 04:45:48.680 align:start position:0%
amendment it has more with the testimony
 
04:45:50.390 --> 04:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
that was presented to our committee
 
04:45:52.070 --> 04:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
which bothers me
 
04:45:52.080 --> 04:45:54.150 align:start position:0%
which bothers me
significantly

04:45:54.150 --> 04:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
04:45:58.550 --> 04:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
that um the sponsor
 
04:46:02.910 --> 04:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
testimony was strictly discussing
 
04:46:06.670 --> 04:46:06.680 align:start position:0%
DCF and although it says all branches of
 
04:46:08.590 --> 04:46:08.600 align:start position:0%
government and I have
 
04:46:12.708 --> 04:46:12.718 align:start position:0%
all confidence that that it could be all
 
04:46:13.948 --> 04:46:13.958 align:start position:0%
branches of
 
04:46:16.550 --> 04:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
government I still have this concern
 
04:46:20.390 --> 04:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
that it will not be so therefore that's
 
04:46:22.350 --> 04:46:22.360 align:start position:0%
my reason for not supporting the bill
 
04:46:24.510 --> 04:46:24.520 align:start position:0%
and I apologize and I feel very badly
 
04:46:29.070 --> 04:46:29.080 align:start position:0%
about it but I can't I can't do it sorry
 
04:46:31.150 --> 04:46:31.160 align:start position:0%
okay representative Leon uh thank you
 
04:46:32.708 --> 04:46:32.718 align:start position:0%
madam chair and uh thank you for
 
04:46:35.470 --> 04:46:35.480 align:start position:0%
expressing that representative groda uh
 
04:46:38.150 --> 04:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
given the town where the prime sponsor
 
04:46:39.948 --> 04:46:39.958 align:start position:0%
represents and given some of the termout
 
04:46:41.788 --> 04:46:41.798 align:start position:0%
that happened during special committee
 
04:46:44.270 --> 04:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
that I chaired with DCF and somebody
 
04:46:46.910 --> 04:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
else from his town I understand why
 
04:46:48.948 --> 04:46:48.958 align:start position:0%
concerns over data with DCF would be
 
04:46:51.270 --> 04:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
front of mind for him however I don't
 
04:46:53.670 --> 04:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
believe that this bill deals with DC is
 
04:46:56.548 --> 04:46:56.558 align:start position:0%
intended to specifically deal with DCF I
 
04:46:57.830 --> 04:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
04:47:00.750 --> 04:47:00.760 align:start position:0%
given given the amount of attention and
 
04:47:03.110 --> 04:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
time that we all spent on this and the
 
04:47:04.670 --> 04:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
lack of data and some of the
 
04:47:07.190 --> 04:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
contentiousness around it that was an
 
04:47:09.430 --> 04:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
example given by the prime sponsor
 
04:47:11.548 --> 04:47:11.558 align:start position:0%
simply because it something that we
 
04:47:14.590 --> 04:47:14.600 align:start position:0%
lived so often and is a good example of
 
04:47:16.510 --> 04:47:16.520 align:start position:0%
how clearer data can help us come to
 
04:47:18.708 --> 04:47:18.718 align:start position:0%
better legislative priorities but I do
 
04:47:20.750 --> 04:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
not believe that this is at all targeted
 
04:47:24.590 --> 04:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
to DCF or any division because this is a
 
04:47:25.750 --> 04:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
matter of making sure that we have
 
04:47:27.830 --> 04:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
transparency in that information which
 
04:47:30.628 --> 04:47:30.638 align:start position:0%
we have so that we can make good choices
 
04:47:32.750 --> 04:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
um I believe that his choice of dcwf as
 
04:47:35.190 --> 04:47:35.200 align:start position:0%
an example was simply an example and was
 
04:47:37.190 --> 04:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
simply brought because of our
 
04:47:39.190 --> 04:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
experiences and not intended as a
 
04:47:42.030 --> 04:47:42.040 align:start position:0%
singling out
 
04:47:46.190 --> 04:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else yeah I'd have to agree
 
04:47:50.430 --> 04:47:50.440 align:start position:0%
that HHS does have a great deal of data
 
04:47:52.390 --> 04:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
but even on a different Bill we are
 
04:47:55.150 --> 04:47:55.160 align:start position:0%
saying doesn't the prescription drug
 
04:47:58.190 --> 04:47:58.200 align:start position:0%
affordability board use data from the
 
04:48:00.070 --> 04:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Insurance well it's not
 
04:48:01.990 --> 04:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
quite in the right format but they it's
 
04:48:04.990 --> 04:48:05.000 align:start position:0%
the same data and I know that the
 
04:48:07.070 --> 04:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
department of safety has a great deal of
 
04:48:10.510 --> 04:48:10.520 align:start position:0%
data on a lot of things Dees has even
 
04:48:13.030 --> 04:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
more more
 
04:48:15.868 --> 04:48:15.878 align:start position:0%
so I think just looking around at what
 
04:48:16.990 --> 04:48:17.000 align:start position:0%
data is
 
04:48:19.310 --> 04:48:19.320 align:start position:0%
available and like they say to look at
 
04:48:22.230 --> 04:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
the formats and see you know are we
 
04:48:26.150 --> 04:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
doing the the smart thing is um is the
 
04:48:29.670 --> 04:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
intent of this commission um it I
 
04:48:31.590 --> 04:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
definitely think that as written it
 
04:48:34.190 --> 04:48:34.200 align:start position:0%
can't proper it can't really be
 
04:48:37.070 --> 04:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
interpreted as a witch hunt on
 
04:48:41.070 --> 04:48:41.080 align:start position:0%
DCF um but it would depend on who on the
 
04:48:43.350 --> 04:48:43.360 align:start position:0%
commission and I can't V for it
 
04:48:45.708 --> 04:48:45.718 align:start position:0%
representative BR yes thank you um I
 
04:48:47.590 --> 04:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate representative Leon and chair
 
04:48:51.430 --> 04:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
McGuire's comments and I hope
 
04:48:54.868 --> 04:48:54.878 align:start position:0%
that you can show me wrong I'm not
 
04:48:57.310 --> 04:48:57.320 align:start position:0%
saying that this is a Witch Hunt DCF but
 
04:48:59.750 --> 04:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
it could be it could be an investigation
 
04:49:01.470 --> 04:49:01.480 align:start position:0%
of something else and you're right it
 
04:49:03.628 --> 04:49:03.638 align:start position:0%
all depends on who's assigned to the
 
04:49:06.110 --> 04:49:06.120 align:start position:0%
committee and I guess that's something
 
04:49:08.030 --> 04:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to have to live with and
 
04:49:10.910 --> 04:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
you know um
 
04:49:12.910 --> 04:49:12.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I appreciate both of you
 
04:49:15.110 --> 04:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
sharing your thoughts okay any other
 
04:49:17.788 --> 04:49:17.798 align:start position:0%
questions comments
 
04:49:20.670 --> 04:49:20.680 align:start position:0%
concerns Lam uh thank you madam chair um
 
04:49:22.110 --> 04:49:22.120 align:start position:0%
I do want to highlight with bringing up
 
04:49:23.788 --> 04:49:23.798 align:start position:0%
the prescription drug affordability
 
04:49:25.628 --> 04:49:25.638 align:start position:0%
board one of the reasons to have the
 
04:49:28.390 --> 04:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
board is because the data sharing isn't
 
04:49:29.910 --> 04:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
really there between the department of
 
04:49:32.788 --> 04:49:32.798 align:start position:0%
insurance and others so having a better
 
04:49:34.548 --> 04:49:34.558 align:start position:0%
understanding of the sources of data and
 
04:49:35.948 --> 04:49:35.958 align:start position:0%
potentially how to share them in a
 
04:49:38.470 --> 04:49:38.480 align:start position:0%
responsible way would save a lot of
 
04:49:40.030 --> 04:49:40.040 align:start position:0%
money and save a lot of redundancies
 
04:49:41.390 --> 04:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
throughout the government and therefore
 
04:49:43.510 --> 04:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
I think that this is a very important
 
04:49:48.110 --> 04:49:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:51.868 --> 04:49:51.878 align:start position:0%
else okay in that case the motion is
 
04:49:53.788 --> 04:49:53.798 align:start position:0%
ought to pass with Amendment and the
 
04:49:55.708 --> 04:49:55.718 align:start position:0%

two things I have yet to failed to call
 
04:51:00.190 --> 04:51:00.200 align:start position:0%
the chair oh congratulations rookie
 
04:51:02.390 --> 04:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
mistake of mine many times you're not
 
04:51:04.390 --> 04:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
the only one every clerk does it the
 
04:51:06.948 --> 04:51:06.958 align:start position:0%
other thing is we've exct 19 bills for
 
04:51:10.830 --> 04:51:10.840 align:start position:0%
anybody's County thank you
 
04:51:13.470 --> 04:51:13.480 align:start position:0%
hey Madam chair just for uh our
 
04:51:16.868 --> 04:51:16.878 align:start position:0%
own recordkeeping if you will how many
 
04:51:18.310 --> 04:51:18.320 align:start position:0%
more bills do we have to hold hearings
 
04:51:21.788 --> 04:51:21.798 align:start position:0%
on roughly we
 
04:51:25.708 --> 04:51:25.718 align:start position:0%
have I just today scheduled three for
 
04:51:29.110 --> 04:51:29.120 align:start position:0%
the 19th two fairly short ones and a
 
04:51:31.070 --> 04:51:31.080 align:start position:0%
major one and then there I think there
 
04:51:32.830 --> 04:51:32.840 align:start position:0%
are either two or three which will be
 
04:51:36.470 --> 04:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
held on the the 5th and that should be
 
04:51:39.590 --> 04:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
that should be it we're we've been
 
04:51:42.670 --> 04:51:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:46.750 --> 04:51:46.760 align:start position:0%
light good all right and I will go
 
04:51:49.670 --> 04:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
attempt to explain why I voted for a
 
04:51:49.680 --> 04:51:51.310 align:start position:0%
attempt to explain why I voted for a
study

04:51:51.310 --> 04:51:51.320 align:start position:0%
study
 
04:51:54.150 --> 04:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
committee all right
 
04:51:57.910 --> 04:51:57.920 align:start position:0%

04:52:17.470 --> 04:52:17.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:19.070 --> 04:52:19.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair fellow members of
 
04:52:21.150 --> 04:52:21.160 align:start position:0%
the committee uh I'm here to encourage
 
04:52:24.990 --> 04:52:25.000 align:start position:0%
you to vote a to pass on HP 252 to
 
04:52:27.548 --> 04:52:27.558 align:start position:0%
declare January 18th as Daniel Webster
 
04:52:30.270 --> 04:52:30.280 align:start position:0%
day um we've had a lot of talk about um
 
04:52:32.670 --> 04:52:32.680 align:start position:0%
patriotism and state symbols today and I
 
04:52:35.030 --> 04:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
think that Daniel Webster is a very
 
04:52:36.670 --> 04:52:36.680 align:start position:0%
important symbol of the State of New
 
04:52:39.230 --> 04:52:39.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire not just within the state but
 
04:52:41.310 --> 04:52:41.320 align:start position:0%
as we represent ourselves outside of the
 
04:52:44.590 --> 04:52:44.600 align:start position:0%
state um the but first I would like to
 
04:52:46.350 --> 04:52:46.360 align:start position:0%
talk about what this bill is not because
 
04:52:48.350 --> 04:52:48.360 align:start position:0%
I've read a lot of um or some of the
 
04:52:52.350 --> 04:52:52.360 align:start position:0%
opposition comments on on the online for
 
04:52:53.910 --> 04:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
and some people seem to think that this
 
04:52:56.948 --> 04:52:56.958 align:start position:0%
is a day off for workers it is not this
 
04:53:00.788 --> 04:53:00.798 align:start position:0%
is a um State commemoration um simply
 
04:53:02.470 --> 04:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
remembering the history of Daniel
 
04:53:05.270 --> 04:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
Webster um as an important figure in New
 
04:53:08.310 --> 04:53:08.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire history um and the reason I
 
04:53:10.670 --> 04:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
brought this forward is because I spoke
 
04:53:12.590 --> 04:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
to a lot of school administrators and
 
04:53:15.430 --> 04:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
teachers who look for more ways to
 
04:53:17.788 --> 04:53:17.798 align:start position:0%
engage students with New Hampshire
 
04:53:21.270 --> 04:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
history and they find that these sorts
 
04:53:23.990 --> 04:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
of State commemorations like what would
 
04:53:26.070 --> 04:53:26.080 align:start position:0%
be Daniel Webster day like John Stark
 
04:53:28.750 --> 04:53:28.760 align:start position:0%
day like Constitution Day these are ways
 
04:53:31.548 --> 04:53:31.558 align:start position:0%
to provide excuses to take some time and
 
04:53:33.590 --> 04:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
talk about the significance of New
 
04:53:36.510 --> 04:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire history and the reason I
 
04:53:38.070 --> 04:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
brought forward Daniel Webster day is
 
04:53:41.190 --> 04:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
because we have uh a day for General
 
04:53:43.750 --> 04:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
John Stark who is significant in his
 
04:53:45.548 --> 04:53:45.558 align:start position:0%
contributions to the re Revolutionary
 
04:53:49.030 --> 04:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
War well Webster is just as significant
 
04:53:52.708 --> 04:53:52.718 align:start position:0%
to the um post-war period as America
 
04:53:54.350 --> 04:53:54.360 align:start position:0%
tries to Define itself on the world
 
04:53:56.510 --> 04:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
stage particularly leading up to the
 
04:53:59.590 --> 04:53:59.600 align:start position:0%
Civil War in the antibellum period um
 
04:54:01.470 --> 04:54:01.480 align:start position:0%
but I don't really want to focus on his
 
04:54:03.430 --> 04:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
oration because that's something I would
 
04:54:05.990 --> 04:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
hope a lot of people are aware of I kind
 
04:54:09.628 --> 04:54:09.638 align:start position:0%
of want to focus on um something that
 
04:54:11.230 --> 04:54:11.240 align:start position:0%
people might not know and that's sort of
 
04:54:15.548 --> 04:54:15.558 align:start position:0%
his upbringing uh his life story is um
 
04:54:17.590 --> 04:54:17.600 align:start position:0%
the embodiment of the American dream he
 
04:54:22.190 --> 04:54:22.200 align:start position:0%
was born in Salsbury now Franklin and um
 
04:54:24.470 --> 04:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
he was expected not to survive he was a
 
04:54:28.230 --> 04:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
very sickly baby um born to poor um
 
04:54:30.868 --> 04:54:30.878 align:start position:0%
farming parents on what was then the
 
04:54:34.548 --> 04:54:34.558 align:start position:0%
frontier and um despite the odds he
 
04:54:36.948 --> 04:54:36.958 align:start position:0%
survived and he be um while he couldn't
 
04:54:38.470 --> 04:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
work on the farm like his brothers and
 
04:54:41.470 --> 04:54:41.480 align:start position:0%
sisters he did become an Avid Reader he
 
04:54:43.830 --> 04:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
memorized um large chunks of the Bible
 
04:54:45.750 --> 04:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
to the point where when they had
 
04:54:47.110 --> 04:54:47.120 align:start position:0%
competitions to see who could read the
 
04:54:48.948 --> 04:54:48.958 align:start position:0%
most of the Bible his teachers actually
 
04:54:52.510 --> 04:54:52.520 align:start position:0%
had to tell him to stop because they um
 
04:54:54.230 --> 04:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
he he just kept going and going he
 
04:54:55.868 --> 04:54:55.878 align:start position:0%
memorized the Constitution as a young
 
04:54:58.708 --> 04:54:58.718 align:start position:0%
boy there's a portrait of him doing so
 
04:55:02.150 --> 04:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
in the New Hampshire Senate and he's
 
04:55:03.750 --> 04:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
really an embodiment of it what it means
 
04:55:06.430 --> 04:55:06.440 align:start position:0%
to be well read and well educated as a
 
04:55:08.910 --> 04:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
child especially in the ways of civics
 
04:55:10.990 --> 04:55:11.000 align:start position:0%
and he later became one of the stest
 
04:55:12.510 --> 04:55:12.520 align:start position:0%
Defenders of the constitution in the
 
04:55:16.670 --> 04:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
United States Senate um uh he went he
 
04:55:19.670 --> 04:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
also went to Dartmouth at age 15 despite
 
04:55:22.788 --> 04:55:22.798 align:start position:0%
his parents meager finances um they
 
04:55:24.190 --> 04:55:24.200 align:start position:0%
sacrificed everything they could to make
 
04:55:25.788 --> 04:55:25.798 align:start position:0%
sure that he got the education that he
 
04:55:28.788 --> 04:55:28.798 align:start position:0%
needed and deserved um and he ended up
 
04:55:31.070 --> 04:55:31.080 align:start position:0%
being incredibly successful despite all
 
04:55:33.670 --> 04:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
of the challenges that laid in his way
 
04:55:36.990 --> 04:55:37.000 align:start position:0%
um and in addition to that um his
 
04:55:38.788 --> 04:55:38.798 align:start position:0%
influence is still felt into the modern
 
04:55:41.310 --> 04:55:41.320 align:start position:0%
day um he started the United States
 
04:55:43.708 --> 04:55:43.718 align:start position:0%
Senate page program when he was um in
 
04:55:45.830 --> 04:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
the Senate representing the state of
 
04:55:50.270 --> 04:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and to this day um Pages
 
04:55:52.390 --> 04:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
um know about him they love him and even
 
04:55:54.310 --> 04:55:54.320 align:start position:0%
though I wasn't not a Paige myself so
 
04:55:57.030 --> 04:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
many of them came to me and said how
 
04:55:58.708 --> 04:55:58.718 align:start position:0%
meaningful this is to them they live in
 
04:56:01.030 --> 04:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
a building called Webster Hall in fact
 
04:56:03.350 --> 04:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
and they have a little Shrine in their
 
04:56:05.548 --> 04:56:05.558 align:start position:0%
in their building to to Daniel Webster
 
04:56:08.548 --> 04:56:08.558 align:start position:0%
because this program has really changed
 
04:56:10.350 --> 04:56:10.360 align:start position:0%
their lives it gives them an opportunity
 
04:56:11.788 --> 04:56:11.798 align:start position:0%
to work on the senate floor to learn
 
04:56:13.310 --> 04:56:13.320 align:start position:0%
about our government in a wholly unique
 
04:56:16.470 --> 04:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
way and I think that's a really powerful
 
04:56:19.150 --> 04:56:19.160 align:start position:0%
Legacy of New Hampshire outside of our
 
04:56:23.070 --> 04:56:23.080 align:start position:0%
state um and I understand that there may
 
04:56:24.830 --> 04:56:24.840 align:start position:0%
be concerns about creating new state
 
04:56:26.390 --> 04:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
observes because they won't be
 
04:56:28.990 --> 04:56:29.000 align:start position:0%
recognized people won't know about them
 
04:56:30.670 --> 04:56:30.680 align:start position:0%
but I think this will be different I've
 
04:56:33.110 --> 04:56:33.120 align:start position:0%
talked to administrators both within my
 
04:56:35.110 --> 04:56:35.120 align:start position:0%
district and without and as well as
 
04:56:37.948 --> 04:56:37.958 align:start position:0%
teachers and they really want things
 
04:56:39.868 --> 04:56:39.878 align:start position:0%
like this so they can have opportunities
 
04:56:42.390 --> 04:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
to teach teach um their kids about what
 
04:56:46.910 --> 04:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
makes New Hampshire exceptional and um
 
04:56:48.788 --> 04:56:48.798 align:start position:0%
so this provides them that
 
04:56:50.868 --> 04:56:50.878 align:start position:0%
opportunity um in addition to this I
 
04:56:54.390 --> 04:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
also included the provision to have the
 
04:56:56.030 --> 04:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
um second reply to hanne speech which is
 
04:56:58.310 --> 04:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
considered one of the greatest pieces of
 
04:57:00.708 --> 04:57:00.718 align:start position:0%
oration in American history um to be
 
04:57:02.830 --> 04:57:02.840 align:start position:0%
read each year it's optional it's just
 
04:57:06.830 --> 04:57:06.840 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation um um just so it's
 
04:57:08.470 --> 04:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
very similar to how other bodies
 
04:57:10.230 --> 04:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
including Congress would read the
 
04:57:12.070 --> 04:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
Constitution or the Declaration on the
 
04:57:13.510 --> 04:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
respective anniversaries of those
 
04:57:16.628 --> 04:57:16.638 align:start position:0%
documents just we don't do that because
 
04:57:18.430 --> 04:57:18.440 align:start position:0%
we're not in session for those
 
04:57:21.788 --> 04:57:21.798 align:start position:0%
anniversaries so in addition to this um
 
04:57:24.708 --> 04:57:24.718 align:start position:0%
the mayor of Franklin as well as um um
 
04:57:26.430 --> 04:57:26.440 align:start position:0%
representatives of Dartmouth College and
 
04:57:28.270 --> 04:57:28.280 align:start position:0%
historical societies have reached out to
 
04:57:29.708 --> 04:57:29.718 align:start position:0%
me and expressed their support for this
 
04:57:32.270 --> 04:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
legislation because they really want to
 
04:57:35.070 --> 04:57:35.080 align:start position:0%
see um Websters celebrated and
 
04:57:37.708 --> 04:57:37.718 align:start position:0%
remembered in a way like this and
 
04:57:39.350 --> 04:57:39.360 align:start position:0%
looking back at the Historical records
 
04:57:42.868 --> 04:57:42.878 align:start position:0%
there are many instances of celebrations
 
04:57:45.390 --> 04:57:45.400 align:start position:0%
of um Webster's both birthday and
 
04:57:46.830 --> 04:57:46.840 align:start position:0%
anniversary of his graduation from
 
04:57:49.190 --> 04:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth um throughout the state from
 
04:57:52.470 --> 04:57:52.480 align:start position:0%
Franklin and Salsbury to Handover to at
 
04:57:54.548 --> 04:57:54.558 align:start position:0%
the state level so this is not something
 
04:57:55.948 --> 04:57:55.958 align:start position:0%
that's without precedent it just puts it
 
04:57:59.390 --> 04:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
into State Statute and allow us for it
 
04:58:01.750 --> 04:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
to be more publicly aware for schools to
 
04:58:05.350 --> 04:58:05.360 align:start position:0%
be able to work on so with that um I'll
 
04:58:06.670 --> 04:58:06.680 align:start position:0%
be open to questions but I really
 
04:58:10.948 --> 04:58:10.958 align:start position:0%
encourage you to pass HB 252 thank you
 
04:58:12.990 --> 04:58:13.000 align:start position:0%
okay representa
 
04:58:16.310 --> 04:58:16.320 align:start position:0%
salers thank you madam chair um could
 
04:58:17.830 --> 04:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
you tell me do you know how many
 
04:58:20.390 --> 04:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
proclamations the governor does each
 
04:58:22.868 --> 04:58:22.878 align:start position:0%
year I'm aware there's quite a few um
 
04:58:27.990 --> 04:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
this will be um uh this so this is DD
 
04:58:29.590 --> 04:58:29.600 align:start position:0%
and there have been some that are
 
04:58:31.830 --> 04:58:31.840 align:start position:0%
repealed as well so there are quite a
 
04:58:34.868 --> 04:58:34.878 align:start position:0%
few but this would be um one that isn't
 
04:58:36.510 --> 04:58:36.520 align:start position:0%
so much about the proclamation and more
 
04:58:38.868 --> 04:58:38.878 align:start position:0%
about giving an opportunity for New
 
04:58:43.628 --> 04:58:43.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:47.150 --> 04:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
schools other questions represent Lam uh
 
04:58:49.230 --> 04:58:49.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair would this require
 
04:58:50.990 --> 04:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
this to be taught in the schools no
 
04:58:52.390 --> 04:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
there's no requirement here it just
 
04:58:54.868 --> 04:58:54.878 align:start position:0%
provides the opportunity it gives them a
 
04:58:58.390 --> 04:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
day to just discuss it and um hopefully
 
04:59:01.430 --> 04:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
promote it no the only person who is
 
04:59:03.868 --> 04:59:03.878 align:start position:0%
mandated by it is the governor or
 
04:59:05.150 --> 04:59:05.160 align:start position:0%
actually his
 
04:59:07.788 --> 04:59:07.798 align:start position:0%

04:59:19.390 --> 04:59:19.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:22.070 --> 04:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
252 all right seeing none I will close
 
04:59:36.868 --> 04:59:36.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:43.190 --> 04:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:45.510 --> 04:59:45.520 align:start position:0%

whose memories are in incorrect yes um
 
05:00:25.030 --> 05:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
it is relative to the reduction in the
 
05:00:26.510 --> 05:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
calculation of State retirement
 
05:00:28.910 --> 05:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
annuities at age 65 for certain group
 
05:00:31.590 --> 05:00:31.600 align:start position:0%
one retirement system members um that's
 
05:00:33.150 --> 05:00:33.160 align:start position:0%
the one where it was brought to us as an
 
05:00:36.310 --> 05:00:36.320 align:start position:0%
oversight from um previous introduced as
 
05:00:38.510 --> 05:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
oversight from previous legislation okay
 
05:00:41.830 --> 05:00:41.840 align:start position:0%

05:00:45.030 --> 05:00:45.040 align:start position:0%

saying uh yes we discussed this in our
 
05:00:52.628 --> 05:00:52.638 align:start position:0%
sellers sellers um we discussed this in
 
05:00:54.070 --> 05:00:54.080 align:start position:0%
our subcommittee and we looked at the
 
05:00:57.150 --> 05:00:57.160 align:start position:0%
legislative history of this bill um of
 
05:00:59.910 --> 05:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
the bill that this seeks to correct um
 
05:01:02.470 --> 05:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
in the Senate they heard a bill in order
 
05:01:05.510 --> 05:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
to provide in order to match up the
 
05:01:08.150 --> 05:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
change in retirement payments with the
 
05:01:10.350 --> 05:01:10.360 align:start position:0%
actual full Social Security retirement
 
05:01:12.628 --> 05:01:12.638 align:start position:0%
age as opposed to 65 which had been in
 
05:01:15.230 --> 05:01:15.240 align:start position:0%
the statutes when it was introduced in
 
05:01:18.708 --> 05:01:18.718 align:start position:0%
January 18th of 2023 in the Senate it
 
05:01:20.230 --> 05:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
was highlighted at that point that it
 
05:01:22.310 --> 05:01:22.320 align:start position:0%
would not include anybody who retired
 
05:01:25.270 --> 05:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
prior to the bill being enacted um at
 
05:01:28.510 --> 05:01:28.520 align:start position:0%
that point Senate Edna chose not to
 
05:01:32.470 --> 05:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
amend the bill to um to extend this to
 
05:01:34.430 --> 05:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
people who retired before the effective
 
05:01:37.310 --> 05:01:37.320 align:start position:0%
date um it then went to Senate Finance
 
05:01:40.230 --> 05:01:40.240 align:start position:0%
where they did not choose to extend this
 
05:01:42.628 --> 05:01:42.638 align:start position:0%
to th to those who retired prior to the
 
05:01:44.990 --> 05:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
effective date um even though that was
 
05:01:47.350 --> 05:01:47.360 align:start position:0%
raised in Senate Finance then this was
 
05:01:51.110 --> 05:01:51.120 align:start position:0%
added to the budget by the Senate and at
 
05:01:53.590 --> 05:01:53.600 align:start position:0%
that point they also did not choose to
 
05:01:55.628 --> 05:01:55.638 align:start position:0%
include those people who retired prior
 
05:01:57.868 --> 05:01:57.878 align:start position:0%
to the enactment of the budget it was
 
05:01:59.868 --> 05:01:59.878 align:start position:0%
not an oversight it was a conscious
 
05:02:01.830 --> 05:02:01.840 align:start position:0%
Choice by the Senate not to include them
 
05:02:04.270 --> 05:02:04.280 align:start position:0%
on this bill that had on on the original
 
05:02:05.708 --> 05:02:05.718 align:start position:0%
bill which had a pretty significant
 
05:02:07.868 --> 05:02:07.878 align:start position:0%
fiscal note there was discussion in the
 
05:02:09.510 --> 05:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
committee that it's not our job to deal
 
05:02:10.430 --> 05:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
with money
 
05:02:12.230 --> 05:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
because this goes to finance but this is
 
05:02:14.270 --> 05:02:14.280 align:start position:0%
actually not a second committee bill
 
05:02:16.510 --> 05:02:16.520 align:start position:0%
this bill if we were to approve it now
 
05:02:18.110 --> 05:02:18.120 align:start position:0%
would move forward and would not go to
 
05:02:19.788 --> 05:02:19.798 align:start position:0%
finance because there was not a fiscal
 
05:02:23.430 --> 05:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
note on it so we don't even know how
 
05:02:25.548 --> 05:02:25.558 align:start position:0%
large of a financial impact this would
 
05:02:28.230 --> 05:02:28.240 align:start position:0%
have so given that we don't understand
 
05:02:30.230 --> 05:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
how large it would be it would not go to
 
05:02:32.830 --> 05:02:32.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal and it was a conscious choice on
 
05:02:35.110 --> 05:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
the part of the Senate to not include
 
05:02:37.350 --> 05:02:37.360 align:start position:0%
the people who had retired prior to the
 
05:02:39.030 --> 05:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
enactment I believe that it's
 
05:02:41.230 --> 05:02:41.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate to to um vote an expedient
 
05:02:43.670 --> 05:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
to legislate on this
 
05:02:48.230 --> 05:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:50.708 --> 05:02:50.718 align:start position:0%
salar nothing to add okay thank you
 
05:02:52.788 --> 05:02:52.798 align:start position:0%
representative Howard thank you madam
 
05:02:55.310 --> 05:02:55.320 align:start position:0%
chair so a while back there was a
 
05:02:57.470 --> 05:02:57.480 align:start position:0%
reduction in calculation for State uh
 
05:02:59.150 --> 05:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
retirement annuities for group two
 
05:03:01.830 --> 05:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
retires and this is just trying to make
 
05:03:04.310 --> 05:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
sure that we have the same system
 
05:03:08.150 --> 05:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
applying to both groups it would
 
05:03:10.708 --> 05:03:10.718 align:start position:0%
make I'm sorry to interupt to which two
 
05:03:13.628 --> 05:03:13.638 align:start position:0%
groups group one and group two I I I may
 
05:03:16.750 --> 05:03:16.760 align:start position:0%
have this is again I'm trying to
 
05:03:18.390 --> 05:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
remember from the subcommittee but
 
05:03:20.670 --> 05:03:20.680 align:start position:0%
because I don't have my notes but there
 
05:03:23.548 --> 05:03:23.558 align:start position:0%
was an explanation provided by uh one of
 
05:03:25.548 --> 05:03:25.558 align:start position:0%
uh the members who showed up talking
 
05:03:28.750 --> 05:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
about how this was trying to uh fix a
 
05:03:31.910 --> 05:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
gap that we had where there was a change
 
05:03:34.150 --> 05:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
made to one of the other groups and not
 
05:03:35.628 --> 05:03:35.638 align:start position:0%
provided to the other so this is just
 
05:03:37.070 --> 05:03:37.080 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure that we have
 
05:03:38.868 --> 05:03:38.878 align:start position:0%
equality in the policy that we are
 
05:03:41.430 --> 05:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
providing and while there is going to be
 
05:03:43.590 --> 05:03:43.600 align:start position:0%
an increase in the fiscal note there was
 
05:03:45.430 --> 05:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note included at at the end of
 
05:03:48.310 --> 05:03:48.320 align:start position:0%
the bill uh this is still something that
 
05:03:50.350 --> 05:03:50.360 align:start position:0%
should be considered by Finance because
 
05:03:51.670 --> 05:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
at least in terms of a policy
 
05:03:53.150 --> 05:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
perspective I think that we should be
 
05:03:55.310 --> 05:03:55.320 align:start position:0%
making sure that we are providing uh a
 
05:03:58.670 --> 05:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
quality across the board thank you
 
05:04:02.310 --> 05:04:02.320 align:start position:0%
okay I'd like to comment on that the
 
05:04:06.190 --> 05:04:06.200 align:start position:0%
change oh since the
 
05:04:06.200 --> 05:04:07.750 align:start position:0%
change oh since the
80s

05:04:07.750 --> 05:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
80s
 
05:04:11.750 --> 05:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
um group one has had a reduction in
 
05:04:16.788 --> 05:04:16.798 align:start position:0%
their pension at the age of 65 which
 
05:04:19.910 --> 05:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
was to correspond with their retirement
 
05:04:22.548 --> 05:04:22.558 align:start position:0%
age for Social
 
05:04:25.430 --> 05:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
Security the bill that the Senate dealt
 
05:04:30.830 --> 05:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
with two years ago moved it from age 65
 
05:04:34.430 --> 05:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
to the Social Security full retirement
 
05:04:38.030 --> 05:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
age and it was that was change that was
 
05:04:41.910 --> 05:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
implemented as of the date of effective
 
05:04:41.920 --> 05:04:44.830 align:start position:0%
implemented as of the date of effective
effectivity

05:04:44.830 --> 05:04:44.840 align:start position:0%
effectivity
 
05:04:48.470 --> 05:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
these the the Gap is between the people
 
05:04:51.670 --> 05:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
who retired before that bill was
 
05:04:54.110 --> 05:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
effective and were still under
 
05:04:57.910 --> 05:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
65 so it's not that things changed for
 
05:05:01.230 --> 05:05:01.240 align:start position:0%
them it's that things did not change
 
05:05:04.990 --> 05:05:05.000 align:start position:0%
they had been dealing with this change
 
05:05:05.000 --> 05:05:06.030 align:start position:0%
they had been dealing with this change
in

05:05:06.030 --> 05:05:06.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:05:09.470 --> 05:05:09.480 align:start position:0%
retirement and change in pension since
 
05:05:09.480 --> 05:05:10.310 align:start position:0%
retirement and change in pension since
the

05:05:10.310 --> 05:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:05:13.030 --> 05:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
80s and when they retired they knew what
 
05:05:14.470 --> 05:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
was going to
 
05:05:18.030 --> 05:05:18.040 align:start position:0%
happen so they were not and the and the
 
05:05:21.788 --> 05:05:21.798 align:start position:0%
Senate apparently deliberately decided
 
05:05:24.788 --> 05:05:24.798 align:start position:0%
not to backdate the effectivity to
 
05:05:26.548 --> 05:05:26.558 align:start position:0%
people who
 
05:05:30.628 --> 05:05:30.638 align:start position:0%
were retired but not under age but not
 
05:05:35.510 --> 05:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
over age 65 at the time and uh it it's
 
05:05:38.510 --> 05:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
not like any of the changes made to
 
05:05:40.868 --> 05:05:40.878 align:start position:0%
group two where things changed after
 
05:05:43.510 --> 05:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
they were hired this is that a change
 
05:05:46.150 --> 05:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
was not
 
05:05:53.470 --> 05:05:53.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:53.480 --> 05:05:55.190 align:start position:0%
 
clear

05:05:55.190 --> 05:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
clear
 
05:05:58.510 --> 05:05:58.520 align:start position:0%
any other comments questions
 
05:06:01.868 --> 05:06:01.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:05.590 --> 05:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
R thank you um first of
 
05:06:09.708 --> 05:06:09.718 align:start position:0%
all the fiscal note for this bill
 
05:06:11.708 --> 05:06:11.718 align:start position:0%
was going to be delivered to the house
 
05:06:14.868 --> 05:06:14.878 align:start position:0%
Clerk and I have to tell you that I miss
 
05:06:17.230 --> 05:06:17.240 align:start position:0%
Marty Carlin and I'm sure the New
 
05:06:20.230 --> 05:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system ises him too
 
05:06:23.750 --> 05:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
however the fact that there's an impact
 
05:06:26.390 --> 05:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
a financial impact on this bill does not
 
05:06:28.788 --> 05:06:28.798 align:start position:0%
mean that it's not going to finance so
 
05:06:30.750 --> 05:06:30.760 align:start position:0%
it will go to finance I have no doubt
 
05:06:34.548 --> 05:06:34.558 align:start position:0%
about that it's not an early Bill okay
 
05:06:39.350 --> 05:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
well it has an FN on it thank you yes so
 
05:06:41.670 --> 05:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
the other
 
05:06:44.590 --> 05:06:44.600 align:start position:0%
um the other uh point that I want to
 
05:06:48.788 --> 05:06:48.798 align:start position:0%
make is that the way this was originally
 
05:06:53.270 --> 05:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
written did not include this
 
05:06:56.470 --> 05:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
Loop and so what this bill's trying to
 
05:06:59.708 --> 05:06:59.718 align:start position:0%
do is include this group and bring them
 
05:07:02.990 --> 05:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
in line with group two group one was
 
05:07:05.150 --> 05:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
never in line with them on this
 
05:07:05.160 --> 05:07:06.270 align:start position:0%
never in line with them on this
particular

05:07:06.270 --> 05:07:06.280 align:start position:0%
particular
 
05:07:08.548 --> 05:07:08.558 align:start position:0%
issue group two this has nothing to do
 
05:07:10.110 --> 05:07:10.120 align:start position:0%
with group two
 
05:07:11.350 --> 05:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
well that's what was given in the
 
05:07:12.750 --> 05:07:12.760 align:start position:0%
testimony that's what I have written
 
05:07:14.708 --> 05:07:14.718 align:start position:0%
down no it doesn't have anything to do
 
05:07:18.590 --> 05:07:18.600 align:start position:0%
with group two it's only group one that
 
05:07:22.350 --> 05:07:22.360 align:start position:0%
this was some sort of a clude that the
 
05:07:25.708 --> 05:07:25.718 align:start position:0%
legislature in the 80s came up with when
 
05:07:28.270 --> 05:07:28.280 align:start position:0%
they were disentangling the P the group
 
05:07:31.150 --> 05:07:31.160 align:start position:0%
one pensions from Social Security and
 
05:07:33.190 --> 05:07:33.200 align:start position:0%
the history
 
05:07:36.948 --> 05:07:36.958 align:start position:0%
is murky to say the least right has
 
05:07:39.548 --> 05:07:39.558 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with group two so I'm I
 
05:07:43.548 --> 05:07:43.558 align:start position:0%
mean I support the itl but I support the
 
05:07:43.558 --> 05:07:45.070 align:start position:0%
mean I support the itl but I support the
itl

05:07:45.070 --> 05:07:45.080 align:start position:0%
itl
 
05:07:47.628 --> 05:07:47.638 align:start position:0%
for reasons
 
05:07:51.150 --> 05:07:51.160 align:start position:0%
that um I think I don't I don't want to
 
05:07:53.390 --> 05:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
change the retirement system anymore
 
05:07:54.910 --> 05:07:54.920 align:start position:0%
than it's already changed I want to
 
05:07:57.150 --> 05:07:57.160 align:start position:0%
leave it the way it is let things we've
 
05:07:58.910 --> 05:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
made a lot of changes to it I just would
 
05:08:01.910 --> 05:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
like things to stay the same for a while
 
05:08:03.990 --> 05:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
um just to see where we are especially
 
05:08:07.390 --> 05:08:07.400 align:start position:0%
in a year like this one so I support the
 
05:08:10.670 --> 05:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
itl thank you that's very clear any
 
05:08:12.510 --> 05:08:12.520 align:start position:0%
other comment
 
05:08:15.470 --> 05:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
onitech I was around when we when this
 
05:08:19.868 --> 05:08:19.878 align:start position:0%
murkiness started um and there was never
 
05:08:23.470 --> 05:08:23.480 align:start position:0%
a Clear Connection even though the dates
 
05:08:28.628 --> 05:08:28.638 align:start position:0%
were 65 and convenient or lent
 
05:08:31.190 --> 05:08:31.200 align:start position:0%
themselves to comparison with Social
 
05:08:34.270 --> 05:08:34.280 align:start position:0%
Security it was never established that
 
05:08:38.030 --> 05:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
that was the reason I've never liked
 
05:08:43.788 --> 05:08:43.798 align:start position:0%
it I will vote against itl and maybe
 
05:08:43.798 --> 05:08:44.670 align:start position:0%
it I will vote against itl and maybe
when

05:08:44.670 --> 05:08:44.680 align:start position:0%
when
 
05:08:47.750 --> 05:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
Finance persuades me otherwise in light
 
05:08:50.350 --> 05:08:50.360 align:start position:0%
of this year but it just never felt
 
05:08:54.948 --> 05:08:54.958 align:start position:0%
right to me ever so oh
 
05:08:57.548 --> 05:08:57.558 align:start position:0%
interesting represent lamb uh thank you
 
05:08:59.470 --> 05:08:59.480 align:start position:0%
madam chair this bill is not marked as
 
05:09:01.190 --> 05:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
an early bill this is due out of
 
05:09:04.270 --> 05:09:04.280 align:start position:0%
committee March March 20th which means
 
05:09:07.270 --> 05:09:07.280 align:start position:0%
that it is not going to finance so this
 
05:09:10.030 --> 05:09:10.040 align:start position:0%
we are the final statement in the house
 
05:09:11.830 --> 05:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
we do it soon enough we might be able to
 
05:09:15.628 --> 05:09:15.638 align:start position:0%
get it to finance but anyway if it if it
 
05:09:17.788 --> 05:09:17.798 align:start position:0%
if we if we pass it I'm going to
 
05:09:19.548 --> 05:09:19.558 align:start position:0%
strongly recommend that it does go to
 
05:09:22.628 --> 05:09:22.638 align:start position:0%
finance because it has a fiscal note
 
05:09:28.628 --> 05:09:28.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:31.708 --> 05:09:31.718 align:start position:0%

not be that will then be on the regular
 
05:11:14.400 --> 05:11:18.430 align:start position:0%
not be that will then be on the regular
calendar

05:11:18.430 --> 05:11:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:26.990 --> 05:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:31.230 --> 05:11:31.240 align:start position:0%
EXA represent Shane you have a
 
05:11:34.470 --> 05:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
suggestion yes um our subcommittee would
 
05:11:36.948 --> 05:11:36.958 align:start position:0%
like to recommend adopting an amendment
 
05:11:40.990 --> 05:11:41.000 align:start position:0%
that we um created for HB 428 I have
 
05:11:46.070 --> 05:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:50.030 --> 05:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
committee okay repres Shan moves House
 
05:11:52.990 --> 05:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
Bill 428 with Amendment and he's giving
 
05:11:56.990 --> 05:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:03.628 --> 05:12:03.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:06.788 --> 05:12:06.798 align:start position:0%
okay and this I believe is the municipal
 
05:12:10.628 --> 05:12:10.638 align:start position:0%
amendments to the building code correct
 
05:12:13.150 --> 05:12:13.160 align:start position:0%
yes so um may I speak to the amendment
 
05:12:16.030 --> 05:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
Madam chair please
 
05:12:19.230 --> 05:12:19.240 align:start position:0%
speak um the amendment
 
05:12:22.470 --> 05:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
um was approved by the prime sponsor as
 
05:12:26.110 --> 05:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
well as looked over um and drafted with
 
05:12:28.430 --> 05:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
the help of Phil Sherman um on the
 
05:12:31.350 --> 05:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
building uh code review board the
 
05:12:33.590 --> 05:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
amendment replaces all of the existing
 
05:12:35.628 --> 05:12:35.638 align:start position:0%
Bill language without changing the
 
05:12:37.510 --> 05:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
intent of the underlying
 
05:12:39.868 --> 05:12:39.878 align:start position:0%
Bill the amendment allows for
 
05:12:41.910 --> 05:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
administrative amendments related to
 
05:12:44.590 --> 05:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority and allows for
 
05:12:46.788 --> 05:12:46.798 align:start position:0%
multiple ways the code could be
 
05:12:48.868 --> 05:12:48.878 align:start position:0%
implemented in
 
05:12:51.070 --> 05:12:51.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities the amendment also
 
05:12:53.948 --> 05:12:53.958 align:start position:0%
performs some bookkeeping moving
 
05:12:56.510 --> 05:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
building code related sections now in
 
05:12:58.990 --> 05:12:59.000 align:start position:0%
the land use and City Grant of powers
 
05:13:02.708 --> 05:13:02.718 align:start position:0%
chapters into RSA 155a where they should
 
05:13:06.430 --> 05:13:06.440 align:start position:0%
be placed um and it corrects conflicting
 
05:13:09.110 --> 05:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
terminology a cross reference error with
 
05:13:11.990 --> 05:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
within the current statutes but still
 
05:13:13.548 --> 05:13:13.558 align:start position:0%
maintains the current building code
 
05:13:15.868 --> 05:13:15.878 align:start position:0%
review board confirmation process for
 
05:13:17.868 --> 05:13:17.878 align:start position:0%
necessary administrative
 
05:13:20.708 --> 05:13:20.718 align:start position:0%
ordinances um the amendment also removes
 
05:13:22.628 --> 05:13:22.638 align:start position:0%
several references to the state fire
 
05:13:24.868 --> 05:13:24.878 align:start position:0%
code in order that they may re be
 
05:13:28.628 --> 05:13:28.638 align:start position:0%
relocated to um um a more appropriately
 
05:13:31.670 --> 05:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate place and I believe that
 
05:13:34.590 --> 05:13:34.600 align:start position:0%
that's being done through a Senate
 
05:13:37.708 --> 05:13:37.718 align:start position:0%
bill so um with that the the
 
05:13:39.548 --> 05:13:39.558 align:start position:0%
subcommittee recommends
 
05:13:42.190 --> 05:13:42.200 align:start position:0%
passing the amendment and then also
 
05:13:48.230 --> 05:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:52.030 --> 05:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
amendment okay represent
 
05:13:54.230 --> 05:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
Lam thank you I think she said more than
 
05:13:56.190 --> 05:13:56.200 align:start position:0%
I could on
 
05:13:58.830 --> 05:13:58.840 align:start position:0%
this you had a question I do I just want
 
05:14:03.390 --> 05:14:03.400 align:start position:0%
to make sure that so I'm reading on page
 
05:14:08.030 --> 05:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:10.590 --> 05:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
20 any provision of the State Building
 
05:14:13.110 --> 05:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
Code that conflicts with existing local
 
05:14:15.510 --> 05:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
ordinances regulations policies
 
05:14:17.548 --> 05:14:17.558 align:start position:0%
practices or procedures regarding the
 
05:14:20.150 --> 05:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
appointment removal or duties of
 
05:14:22.750 --> 05:14:22.760 align:start position:0%
Municipal Employees and organization of
 
05:14:26.150 --> 05:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
Municipal departments shall not
 
05:14:29.070 --> 05:14:29.080 align:start position:0%
apply provided that the ordinances
 
05:14:31.390 --> 05:14:31.400 align:start position:0%
regulations policies and practices or
 
05:14:34.230 --> 05:14:34.240 align:start position:0%
procedures do not prevent effective
 
05:14:37.430 --> 05:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement of the State Building Code
 
05:14:38.750 --> 05:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
so I just want to make sure what they're
 
05:14:43.230 --> 05:14:43.240 align:start position:0%
saying saying is that Municipal
 
05:14:46.030 --> 05:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
Department's Personnel cannot interfere
 
05:14:50.350 --> 05:14:50.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:54.150 --> 05:14:54.160 align:start position:0%
saying that didn't come up uh when we
 
05:14:57.470 --> 05:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
were discussing it but I would think
 
05:14:59.628 --> 05:14:59.638 align:start position:0%
that that's what it says I'm not an
 
05:15:02.708 --> 05:15:02.718 align:start position:0%
expert on the that particular
 
05:15:05.628 --> 05:15:05.638 align:start position:0%
section but it didn't come out um in
 
05:15:08.990 --> 05:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
anything that uh the building codes um
 
05:15:11.190 --> 05:15:11.200 align:start position:0%
review board or anything when he was
 
05:15:18.070 --> 05:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:21.110 --> 05:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
amendment represent um thank you madam
 
05:15:22.670 --> 05:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative groda
 
05:15:24.350 --> 05:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
for highlighting that if I were to take
 
05:15:26.230 --> 05:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
out part of it it reads any provision of
 
05:15:28.190 --> 05:15:28.200 align:start position:0%
the State Building Code that conflicts
 
05:15:31.030 --> 05:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
shall not apply so I'm curious if this
 
05:15:33.510 --> 05:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
means that it's actually instead of
 
05:15:35.230 --> 05:15:35.240 align:start position:0%
having the State Building Code be the
 
05:15:37.670 --> 05:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
dominant um choice if this language
 
05:15:39.548 --> 05:15:39.558 align:start position:0%
would actually lead to the Municipal I
 
05:15:40.948 --> 05:15:40.958 align:start position:0%
don't understand I'm just trying to make
 
05:15:43.190 --> 05:15:43.200 align:start position:0%
sure that I understand the language of
 
05:15:45.510 --> 05:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
it because to me if I were to take out
 
05:15:47.510 --> 05:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
everything within that Clause that says
 
05:15:50.350 --> 05:15:50.360 align:start position:0%
with the existing local ordinances I'm
 
05:15:52.030 --> 05:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
just trying to understand exactly what
 
05:15:54.628 --> 05:15:54.638 align:start position:0%
that phrase does for
 
05:15:57.070 --> 05:15:57.080 align:start position:0%
us I'm not quite
 
05:16:00.150 --> 05:16:00.160 align:start position:0%
sure it might be that the building code
 
05:16:01.750 --> 05:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
talks about
 
05:16:06.230 --> 05:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
inspectors and each town can have
 
05:16:08.628 --> 05:16:08.638 align:start position:0%
appoint its code inspectors however it
 
05:16:08.638 --> 05:16:09.868 align:start position:0%
appoint its code inspectors however it
wish

05:16:09.868 --> 05:16:09.878 align:start position:0%
wish
 
05:16:12.390 --> 05:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
and doesn't need anybody's approval they
 
05:16:15.310 --> 05:16:15.320 align:start position:0%
may not call them the the code
 
05:16:15.320 --> 05:16:16.590 align:start position:0%
may not call them the the code
enforcement

05:16:16.590 --> 05:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
05:16:16.600 --> 05:16:19.830 align:start position:0%
enforcement
whatever

05:16:19.830 --> 05:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:24.070 --> 05:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:26.470 --> 05:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
is well that's the way I'm reading this
 
05:16:28.310 --> 05:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
I'm reading this that the what they're
 
05:16:31.830 --> 05:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
saying that any provisions of the State
 
05:16:31.840 --> 05:16:32.910 align:start position:0%
saying that any provisions of the State
Building

05:16:32.910 --> 05:16:32.920 align:start position:0%
Building
 
05:16:36.430 --> 05:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
Code that relate to regulations policies
 
05:16:38.670 --> 05:16:38.680 align:start position:0%
and practices or procedures regarding
 
05:16:40.990 --> 05:16:41.000 align:start position:0%
the appointment removal or duties of the
 
05:16:43.750 --> 05:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
Municipal Employees so originally I
 
05:16:45.788 --> 05:16:45.798 align:start position:0%
think it might have been not in
 
05:16:48.510 --> 05:16:48.520 align:start position:0%
here and so that's what they mean by
 
05:16:48.520 --> 05:16:50.070 align:start position:0%
here and so that's what they mean by
administrative

05:16:50.070 --> 05:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
05:16:53.910 --> 05:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
amendments however my concern still is
 
05:16:56.430 --> 05:16:56.440 align:start position:0%
with line
 
05:16:58.750 --> 05:16:58.760 align:start position:0%
23-31 which says that the building code
 
05:17:00.788 --> 05:17:00.798 align:start position:0%
shall be effective in all Municipal
 
05:17:03.070 --> 05:17:03.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities as defined by blah blah
 
05:17:05.070 --> 05:17:05.080 align:start position:0%
blah in the state without further
 
05:17:07.670 --> 05:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
modification except as permitted by this
 
05:17:10.070 --> 05:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
section and shall be enforced as
 
05:17:12.590 --> 05:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
provided by
 
05:17:15.910 --> 05:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
155a col SEO not withstanding any other
 
05:17:18.310 --> 05:17:18.320 align:start position:0%
provision of the law no local
 
05:17:20.708 --> 05:17:20.718 align:start position:0%
legislative body shall Ena or enforce
 
05:17:24.030 --> 05:17:24.040 align:start position:0%
any ordinance adopt or enforce any
 
05:17:26.708 --> 05:17:26.718 align:start position:0%
rule except as otherwise permitted by
 
05:17:30.470 --> 05:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
the section so are they saying that this
 
05:17:36.350 --> 05:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
that 155 d a as defined in RSA
 
05:17:40.548 --> 05:17:40.558 align:start position:0%
672 allows municipalities
 
05:17:45.948 --> 05:17:45.958 align:start position:0%
to um present amendments for approval is
 
05:17:48.390 --> 05:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
this I just want to be sure that
 
05:17:51.070 --> 05:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities who need relief from the
 
05:17:55.110 --> 05:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
building code for for example in my area
 
05:17:57.670 --> 05:17:57.680 align:start position:0%
we have Wetlands everywhere so we need
 
05:18:01.070 --> 05:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
building Cod modifications for septic
 
05:18:03.270 --> 05:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
systems which is what we have now
 
05:18:03.280 --> 05:18:04.350 align:start position:0%
systems which is what we have now
through

05:18:04.350 --> 05:18:04.360 align:start position:0%
through
 
05:18:06.868 --> 05:18:06.878 align:start position:0%
the that was gone that was gone through
 
05:18:09.750 --> 05:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment process um the proper
 
05:18:12.470 --> 05:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment processes so are we saying
 
05:18:15.548 --> 05:18:15.558 align:start position:0%
that that process is still there albe it
 
05:18:17.470 --> 05:18:17.480 align:start position:0%
smaller or are we saying that that
 
05:18:20.070 --> 05:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
process is gone forever and it might be
 
05:18:23.548 --> 05:18:23.558 align:start position:0%
that we just need to take obviously no
 
05:18:25.628 --> 05:18:25.638 align:start position:0%
and somebody's saying I it it says
 
05:18:27.868 --> 05:18:27.878 align:start position:0%
except as otherwise permitted by this
 
05:18:30.910 --> 05:18:30.920 align:start position:0%
section and this section talks about
 
05:18:33.990 --> 05:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
when you can make amendments which is
 
05:18:37.708 --> 05:18:37.718 align:start position:0%
it's back on page two I think
 
05:18:40.070 --> 05:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
okay the section refer to the whole
 
05:18:45.350 --> 05:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
thing yes yeah this is a section okay
 
05:18:48.788 --> 05:18:48.798 align:start position:0%
okay it is it is more limited than
 
05:18:55.390 --> 05:18:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:57.868 --> 05:18:57.878 align:start position:0%
intent represent de
 
05:19:01.390 --> 05:19:01.400 align:start position:0%
re so um I'd love to give this a really
 
05:19:04.590 --> 05:19:04.600 align:start position:0%
close read um I I'm not comfortable
 
05:19:07.110 --> 05:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
voting on this today myself I'll just
 
05:19:08.948 --> 05:19:08.958 align:start position:0%
put that out there and I want to run
 
05:19:13.270 --> 05:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
this by um my own um building department
 
05:19:16.230 --> 05:19:16.240 align:start position:0%
in my town to see how this would apply I
 
05:19:19.030 --> 05:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
talked a little bit about us having in
 
05:19:21.670 --> 05:19:21.680 align:start position:0%
my community having higher standards in
 
05:19:23.470 --> 05:19:23.480 align:start position:0%
terms of free board and I want to make
 
05:19:26.190 --> 05:19:26.200 align:start position:0%
sure that as currently as this has been
 
05:19:28.590 --> 05:19:28.600 align:start position:0%
amended that we can still have those
 
05:19:28.600 --> 05:19:30.310 align:start position:0%
amended that we can still have those
higher

05:19:30.310 --> 05:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
higher
 
05:19:33.110 --> 05:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
standards and I the way that I on my
 
05:19:35.750 --> 05:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
scanning of this I I'm not 100% sure
 
05:19:37.708 --> 05:19:37.718 align:start position:0%
that that's the case okay I think this
 
05:19:40.548 --> 05:19:40.558 align:start position:0%
is is a little bit much for us to get it
 
05:19:43.868 --> 05:19:43.878 align:start position:0%
once so if if there's no objection we'll
 
05:19:46.470 --> 05:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
recess and come back to this later thank
 
05:19:49.030 --> 05:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
you so much any objections okay thank
 
05:19:51.590 --> 05:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
you we will study this a bit
 
05:19:53.430 --> 05:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
more all
 
05:20:00.670 --> 05:20:00.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:03.510 --> 05:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
else Madam sherff it's yes um if it's
 
05:20:04.990 --> 05:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
proper I'd like to move out to pass on
 
05:20:11.230 --> 05:20:11.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:12.628 --> 05:20:12.638 align:start position:0%
if we can if you'd like to take it up
 
05:20:15.430 --> 05:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
later okay representative tibo since
 
05:20:17.110 --> 05:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
we're still in executive session moves
 
05:20:21.230 --> 05:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:27.590 --> 05:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:27.600 --> 05:20:31.310 align:start position:0%
 
second

05:20:31.310 --> 05:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:36.070 --> 05:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
Howard okay um anything um I mean other
 
05:20:37.990 --> 05:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
than my testimony I would just say this
 
05:20:42.310 --> 05:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
bill does nothing but um um recognize
 
05:20:43.510 --> 05:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
someone who's very important to New
 
05:20:44.990 --> 05:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire history as we've all
 
05:20:46.628 --> 05:20:46.638 align:start position:0%
established it's a very important thing
 
05:20:50.190 --> 05:20:50.200 align:start position:0%
to celebrate and it helps um encourage
 
05:20:53.230 --> 05:20:53.240 align:start position:0%
teachers um in schools to teach their
 
05:20:55.548 --> 05:20:55.558 align:start position:0%
kids about a very important figure so I
 
05:20:57.150 --> 05:20:57.160 align:start position:0%
would encourage an not to pass a motion
 
05:20:58.510 --> 05:20:58.520 align:start position:0%
on this Bill thank you okay
 
05:21:00.548 --> 05:21:00.558 align:start position:0%
representative Howard do you to
 
05:21:03.670 --> 05:21:03.680 align:start position:0%
speak yeah uh thank you madam chair uh I
 
05:21:05.430 --> 05:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
want to agree with representative tbo's
 
05:21:08.030 --> 05:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
comments uh I think that this uh being a
 
05:21:11.030 --> 05:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
Kim rber holiday uh allows us to really
 
05:21:14.230 --> 05:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
kind of uh push uh an opportunity for
 
05:21:16.310 --> 05:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
students to to learn about New Hampshire
 
05:21:18.670 --> 05:21:18.680 align:start position:0%
history and a real New Hampshire icon
 
05:21:18.680 --> 05:21:22.310 align:start position:0%
history and a real New Hampshire icon
thank

05:21:22.310 --> 05:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:25.948 --> 05:21:25.958 align:start position:0%
you anyone else represents s thank you
 
05:21:27.270 --> 05:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
madam chair I'm going to vote against
 
05:21:29.230 --> 05:21:29.240 align:start position:0%
this because it it only says here it
 
05:21:32.708 --> 05:21:32.718 align:start position:0%
says uh line nine it says the schools
 
05:21:35.070 --> 05:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
are encouraged it doesn't say they have
 
05:21:38.590 --> 05:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
to they shall so it's just I don't know
 
05:21:40.910 --> 05:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
I just look at this as a another thing
 
05:21:42.910 --> 05:21:42.920 align:start position:0%
for the governor to do and maybe the
 
05:21:45.390 --> 05:21:45.400 align:start position:0%
schools will do it maybe they
 
05:21:54.390 --> 05:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:57.590 --> 05:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
Pearson in uh three terms in this
 
05:22:00.110 --> 05:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
committee we've had all kinds of
 
05:22:03.350 --> 05:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
fun days come before us
 
05:22:08.590 --> 05:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
and stuff that you just wow but in this
 
05:22:08.600 --> 05:22:10.430 align:start position:0%
and stuff that you just wow but in this
this

05:22:10.430 --> 05:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:22:14.670 --> 05:22:14.680 align:start position:0%
case I think this is this is a little
 
05:22:18.070 --> 05:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
different uh you know in the sense
 
05:22:23.230 --> 05:22:23.240 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at a a very
 
05:22:27.548 --> 05:22:27.558 align:start position:0%
specific person a very specific framer
 
05:22:28.670 --> 05:22:28.680 align:start position:0%
of this
 
05:22:28.680 --> 05:22:31.390 align:start position:0%
of this
country

05:22:31.390 --> 05:22:31.400 align:start position:0%
country
 
05:22:34.548 --> 05:22:34.558 align:start position:0%
um and it's not one of these blanket
 
05:22:36.910 --> 05:22:36.920 align:start position:0%
things where we're you know looking at
 
05:22:38.150 --> 05:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
different flavors of ice cream or
 
05:22:40.150 --> 05:22:40.160 align:start position:0%
something for the day
 
05:22:45.030 --> 05:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
so um as far as the line nine the
 
05:22:48.390 --> 05:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
encouraging part uh we run into problems
 
05:22:50.750 --> 05:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
when we start
 
05:22:54.390 --> 05:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
mandating curriculum which is
 
05:22:56.830 --> 05:22:56.840 align:start position:0%
really not the purview it's really the
 
05:22:58.548 --> 05:22:58.558 align:start position:0%
Department of Education so it's not even
 
05:23:00.310 --> 05:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
this committee that would be mandating
 
05:23:00.320 --> 05:23:02.030 align:start position:0%
this committee that would be mandating
curriculum

05:23:02.030 --> 05:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
05:23:02.040 --> 05:23:03.788 align:start position:0%
curriculum
um

05:23:03.788 --> 05:23:03.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:07.910 --> 05:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
and the encouraging language is
 
05:23:10.470 --> 05:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
consistent with other things so
 
05:23:12.830 --> 05:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
I I I actually would be I would have
 
05:23:15.590 --> 05:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
been object objecting to this if it had
 
05:23:18.910 --> 05:23:18.920 align:start position:0%
been a mandate um simply because it it
 
05:23:20.270 --> 05:23:20.280 align:start position:0%
just wouldn't have been appropriate for
 
05:23:23.788 --> 05:23:23.798 align:start position:0%
this committee to set educational policy
 
05:23:23.798 --> 05:23:27.430 align:start position:0%
this committee to set educational policy
but

05:23:27.430 --> 05:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:30.868 --> 05:23:30.878 align:start position:0%
the the fact that the
 
05:23:33.270 --> 05:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
students today
 
05:23:35.788 --> 05:23:35.798 align:start position:0%
when have no idea who Alan Shepard is
 
05:23:38.548 --> 05:23:38.558 align:start position:0%
who have no they barely know who Chris
 
05:23:41.350 --> 05:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
mall is they barely know there there's
 
05:23:43.030 --> 05:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
too many things that that that have
 
05:23:44.548 --> 05:23:44.558 align:start position:0%
shaped the state and too many folks that
 
05:23:45.750 --> 05:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
have been involved in that that that
 
05:23:47.948 --> 05:23:47.958 align:start position:0%
seem to just be lost forever and Daniel
 
05:23:51.390 --> 05:23:51.400 align:start position:0%
Webster is certainly worthy of of um
 
05:23:51.400 --> 05:23:52.750 align:start position:0%
Webster is certainly worthy of of um
recognition

05:23:52.750 --> 05:23:52.760 align:start position:0%
recognition
 
05:23:56.948 --> 05:23:56.958 align:start position:0%
and and highlighting in in a educational
 
05:24:00.830 --> 05:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
sense and a historical review so so I'm
 
05:24:01.910 --> 05:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
going to go I'm going to go off my
 
05:24:03.110 --> 05:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
normal script with these kind of days
 
05:24:08.750 --> 05:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:10.510 --> 05:24:10.520 align:start position:0%
represent of
 
05:24:13.350 --> 05:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
sellers thank you madam chair I I
 
05:24:15.230 --> 05:24:15.240 align:start position:0%
suppose the other reason I I'm objecting
 
05:24:17.230 --> 05:24:17.240 align:start position:0%
to this is I kids don't even know how to
 
05:24:19.670 --> 05:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
read and write I mean we have a huge
 
05:24:22.470 --> 05:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
failure rate and no one's addressing it
 
05:24:24.190 --> 05:24:24.200 align:start position:0%
and we keep throwing money at it and now
 
05:24:27.350 --> 05:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
we got to throw an encouraging thing
 
05:24:29.830 --> 05:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
that they should be doing on January
 
05:24:33.868 --> 05:24:33.878 align:start position:0%
18th for historical and and good reason
 
05:24:36.070 --> 05:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying it's bad but I'm saying
 
05:24:37.910 --> 05:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
we have a big problem with reading and
 
05:24:40.030 --> 05:24:40.040 align:start position:0%
writing and we need to square that away
 
05:24:41.868 --> 05:24:41.878 align:start position:0%
before we start throwing something else
 
05:24:45.390 --> 05:24:45.400 align:start position:0%
at the kids representative Howard thank
 
05:24:47.430 --> 05:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
you madam chair I I think that when
 
05:24:49.628 --> 05:24:49.638 align:start position:0%
we're talking about history there is a
 
05:24:51.990 --> 05:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
great opportunity for students to engage
 
05:24:53.830 --> 05:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
in reading and writing because there is
 
05:24:55.510 --> 05:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of reading that is done with
 
05:24:57.110 --> 05:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
history I'm a history major right now at
 
05:24:58.830 --> 05:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
the University of New Hampshire I'm I've
 
05:25:01.270 --> 05:25:01.280 align:start position:0%
got one semester left and it's pretty
 
05:25:03.150 --> 05:25:03.160 align:start position:0%
much a majority of our work is just
 
05:25:05.430 --> 05:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
reading through old documents and then
 
05:25:08.390 --> 05:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
writing an analysis of those documents
 
05:25:09.990 --> 05:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
if we're talking about trying to educate
 
05:25:11.470 --> 05:25:11.480 align:start position:0%
our kids about reading and writing I
 
05:25:13.470 --> 05:25:13.480 align:start position:0%
don't really see anything else better
 
05:25:15.948 --> 05:25:15.958 align:start position:0%
than saying read about a New Hampshire
 
05:25:17.590 --> 05:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
historical figure that has been
 
05:25:19.948 --> 05:25:19.958 align:start position:0%
extremely influential in the state and
 
05:25:24.030 --> 05:25:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:26.628 --> 05:25:26.638 align:start position:0%
you I'd like to say that I agree with
 
05:25:29.270 --> 05:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
representative sellers that we shouldn't
 
05:25:33.990 --> 05:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
be telling the teachers of the state to
 
05:25:37.070 --> 05:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
remember Daniel Webster because they
 
05:25:40.548 --> 05:25:40.558 align:start position:0%
know as well as we we do or probably a
 
05:25:43.350 --> 05:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
whole lot better how important he was
 
05:25:46.150 --> 05:25:46.160 align:start position:0%
and what he what his influence was on
 
05:25:50.070 --> 05:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
the state and in its history um they're
 
05:25:52.030 --> 05:25:52.040 align:start position:0%
the expert I'm not going to tell them
 
05:25:56.548 --> 05:25:56.558 align:start position:0%
how to um come or when to commemorate
 
05:25:59.350 --> 05:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
Daniel Webster and
 
05:26:01.910 --> 05:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
I'm strongly opposed to putting this
 
05:26:04.750 --> 05:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
sort of thing into statute because once
 
05:26:08.470 --> 05:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
it happens the supporters go away they
 
05:26:11.070 --> 05:26:11.080 align:start position:0%
have no memory of it it's the governor
 
05:26:14.110 --> 05:26:14.120 align:start position:0%
sends out an announcement and it it
 
05:26:19.590 --> 05:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
fades and I'm against creating more days
 
05:26:23.430 --> 05:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
that are nice they're always of somebody
 
05:26:25.590 --> 05:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
important and interesting
 
05:26:28.110 --> 05:26:28.120 align:start position:0%
but they don't do
 
05:26:31.110 --> 05:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
anything representative lamb um thank
 
05:26:33.110 --> 05:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
you madam chair I am a new member on the
 
05:26:35.230 --> 05:26:35.240 align:start position:0%
commission on Holocaust and genocide
 
05:26:37.510 --> 05:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
education and U while I haven't been
 
05:26:39.070 --> 05:26:39.080 align:start position:0%
part of that Comm commission for long
 
05:26:41.150 --> 05:26:41.160 align:start position:0%
one of the big challenges they're facing
 
05:26:43.190 --> 05:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
is that even though that is in the
 
05:26:46.868 --> 05:26:46.878 align:start position:0%
compulsory education um not many people
 
05:26:48.590 --> 05:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
understand how to teach that we have the
 
05:26:50.310 --> 05:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
Cohen Institute which provides
 
05:26:52.350 --> 05:26:52.360 align:start position:0%
information on how to do this but
 
05:26:53.830 --> 05:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
looking through some of the surveys
 
05:26:55.110 --> 05:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
about what is actually taught in our
 
05:26:57.150 --> 05:26:57.160 align:start position:0%
schools it's unclear whether the
 
05:26:58.910 --> 05:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
teachers and whether the districts even
 
05:27:01.430 --> 05:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
know how to teach Holocaust and genocide
 
05:27:03.868 --> 05:27:03.878 align:start position:0%
education and while I appreciate the
 
05:27:05.670 --> 05:27:05.680 align:start position:0%
interest in wanting to make sure that
 
05:27:07.830 --> 05:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
people know and honor Daniel Webster
 
05:27:10.350 --> 05:27:10.360 align:start position:0%
when we have trouble having consistency
 
05:27:11.990 --> 05:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
in teaching about the Holocaust and
 
05:27:14.470 --> 05:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
genocide I'm also concerned that adding
 
05:27:18.708 --> 05:27:18.718 align:start position:0%
one more thing to that list will um
 
05:27:21.670 --> 05:27:21.680 align:start position:0%
won't be done in the schools and then
 
05:27:23.270 --> 05:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
also people will see that it's there and
 
05:27:24.470 --> 05:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
they'll think that this is already been
 
05:27:27.070 --> 05:27:27.080 align:start position:0%
handled when it's not I think that I
 
05:27:30.030 --> 05:27:30.040 align:start position:0%
think that just creating a state holiday
 
05:27:31.868 --> 05:27:31.878 align:start position:0%
and having the proclamation from the
 
05:27:34.510 --> 05:27:34.520 align:start position:0%
governor without any sort of materials
 
05:27:38.270 --> 05:27:38.280 align:start position:0%
or resources to provide to the to the
 
05:27:41.548 --> 05:27:41.558 align:start position:0%
schools um would allow us to check that
 
05:27:43.270 --> 05:27:43.280 align:start position:0%
box but not necessarily have that
 
05:27:45.868 --> 05:27:45.878 align:start position:0%
education and I actually would encourage
 
05:27:48.470 --> 05:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
encourage you to work on creating some
 
05:27:50.990 --> 05:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
voluntary information that can be used
 
05:27:52.948 --> 05:27:52.958 align:start position:0%
to teach people in the classes so that
 
05:27:54.868 --> 05:27:54.878 align:start position:0%
they can actually understand this and
 
05:27:56.788 --> 05:27:56.798 align:start position:0%
appreciate it and I'm afraid that if we
 
05:27:59.548 --> 05:27:59.558 align:start position:0%
pass it now both both will be operating
 
05:28:01.708 --> 05:28:01.718 align:start position:0%
contrary to sort of what
 
05:28:04.150 --> 05:28:04.160 align:start position:0%
this the way we've approached all of
 
05:28:05.628 --> 05:28:05.638 align:start position:0%
these different proclamations in the
 
05:28:07.150 --> 05:28:07.160 align:start position:0%
past but more importantly people will
 
05:28:09.030 --> 05:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
think that it's handled and done when
 
05:28:10.430 --> 05:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
it's not and I think that that would be
 
05:28:12.628 --> 05:28:12.638 align:start position:0%
more of a shame to have people say that
 
05:28:14.350 --> 05:28:14.360 align:start position:0%
oh we're already teaching this when it's
 
05:28:17.310 --> 05:28:17.320 align:start position:0%
not being taught well representative
 
05:28:19.868 --> 05:28:19.878 align:start position:0%
sler thank you madam chair um I just
 
05:28:21.030 --> 05:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to share that the reason I'll be
 
05:28:22.310 --> 05:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
voting against this I think it's
 
05:28:24.628 --> 05:28:24.638 align:start position:0%
important to understand uh history and
 
05:28:26.750 --> 05:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
all its context but I I feel as though
 
05:28:29.150 --> 05:28:29.160 align:start position:0%
this commemoration might invite
 
05:28:32.788 --> 05:28:32.798 align:start position:0%
unnecessary um Strife in in
 
05:28:34.030 --> 05:28:34.040 align:start position:0%
understanding that Daniel Webster was
 
05:28:36.350 --> 05:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
anti-ab abolitionist and supported the
 
05:28:40.510 --> 05:28:40.520 align:start position:0%
Fugitive Slave Act um as a commemoration
 
05:28:42.230 --> 05:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
I think is is probably a little bit far
 
05:28:43.628 --> 05:28:43.638 align:start position:0%
for the state to go it's important to
 
05:28:46.110 --> 05:28:46.120 align:start position:0%
remember history it's important that
 
05:28:48.590 --> 05:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
that individuals um are accountable to
 
05:28:50.990 --> 05:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
that history but for us to commemorate
 
05:28:53.708 --> 05:28:53.718 align:start position:0%
an individual who had somewhat of a
 
05:28:56.270 --> 05:28:56.280 align:start position:0%
mixed past I think is is something that
 
05:29:00.110 --> 05:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
we ought not put our uh you know invest
 
05:29:02.070 --> 05:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
any time in thank you okay
 
05:29:04.350 --> 05:29:04.360 align:start position:0%
representative broa yes I hope I'm the
 
05:29:06.708 --> 05:29:06.718 align:start position:0%
last speaker I'll be supporting the bill
 
05:29:10.948 --> 05:29:10.958 align:start position:0%
because he have a mixed pack M Miss
 
05:29:13.948 --> 05:29:13.958 align:start position:0%
mixed past but his picture is hanging in
 
05:29:17.310 --> 05:29:17.320 align:start position:0%
in bigger than life in our chamber so
 
05:29:22.150 --> 05:29:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:24.510 --> 05:29:24.520 align:start position:0%
mea I would also point out that he's the
 
05:29:26.230 --> 05:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
only figure to not only have his statue
 
05:29:27.788 --> 05:29:27.798 align:start position:0%
in front of two State houses but also in
 
05:29:29.510 --> 05:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
the US capital and in addition to being
 
05:29:30.830 --> 05:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
in our chamber he's in the New Hampshire
 
05:29:33.990 --> 05:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
Senate chamber so there is not a want
 
05:29:36.390 --> 05:29:36.400 align:start position:0%
for um representation within the state
 
05:29:38.070 --> 05:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
house it's just about getting that out
 
05:29:39.628 --> 05:29:39.638 align:start position:0%
to the people and I would absolutely
 
05:29:41.628 --> 05:29:41.638 align:start position:0%
agree with representative Lon that I
 
05:29:43.270 --> 05:29:43.280 align:start position:0%
think it'd be great to work with the doe
 
05:29:46.150 --> 05:29:46.160 align:start position:0%
to try to get those resources out and
 
05:29:47.670 --> 05:29:47.680 align:start position:0%
maybe that could be an amendment to like
 
05:29:49.270 --> 05:29:49.280 align:start position:0%
say the Department of Education shall be
 
05:29:52.110 --> 05:29:52.120 align:start position:0%
directed to um create some materials to
 
05:29:54.708 --> 05:29:54.718 align:start position:0%
distribute to schools if they um so
 
05:29:57.070 --> 05:29:57.080 align:start position:0%
choose um I'd be open to something like
 
05:29:58.510 --> 05:29:58.520 align:start position:0%
that if that would be something the
 
05:30:00.350 --> 05:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
committee would want or I could work
 
05:30:02.030 --> 05:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
with them on my own if the bill were to
 
05:30:04.708 --> 05:30:04.718 align:start position:0%
pass to get those materials
 
05:30:06.948 --> 05:30:06.958 align:start position:0%
created okay anyone
 
05:30:10.110 --> 05:30:10.120 align:start position:0%
else well spoken represent scitech why
 
05:30:13.150 --> 05:30:13.160 align:start position:0%
did we wait 150 years for this if it was
 
05:30:16.070 --> 05:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
a good idea back then not a bad idea but
 
05:30:19.750 --> 05:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
it's just another clutter unfortunately
 
05:30:19.760 --> 05:30:21.390 align:start position:0%
it's just another clutter unfortunately
all

motion Madam chair representative Howard
 
05:32:34.230 --> 05:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
I would uh like to move to recess this
 
05:32:36.030 --> 05:32:36.040 align:start position:0%
bill until we have more members because
 
05:32:38.510 --> 05:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
this bill is likely going to end up as a
 
05:32:41.190 --> 05:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
tide vote as
 
05:32:45.430 --> 05:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:49.270 --> 05:32:49.280 align:start position:0%
well fine we will recess and revote on
 
05:32:54.548 --> 05:32:54.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:54.558 --> 05:33:01.230 align:start position:0%
 
committee

05:33:01.230 --> 05:33:01.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:03.990 --> 05:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
um I think I've had enough so I'm going
 
05:33:06.230 --> 05:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
you just purp on sellers thank you just
 
05:33:08.350 --> 05:33:08.360 align:start position:0%
a point of order is that is that a
 
05:33:11.708 --> 05:33:11.718 align:start position:0%
proper move I I'm just checking the well
 
05:33:14.270 --> 05:33:14.280 align:start position:0%
the mo the executive session can be
 
05:33:17.670 --> 05:33:17.680 align:start position:0%
recessed at any time at the moment we
 
05:33:21.510 --> 05:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
have a a tie vote looking at the people
 
05:33:23.708 --> 05:33:23.718 align:start position:0%
who voted in in each
 
05:33:26.548 --> 05:33:26.558 align:start position:0%
position it's not clear that they would
 
05:33:28.430 --> 05:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
vote one
 
05:33:34.430 --> 05:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:37.270 --> 05:33:37.280 align:start position:0%
happen and I think we've had enough for
 
05:33:38.788 --> 05:33:38.798 align:start position:0%
today so I'm going to close our
 
05:33:41.628 --> 05:33:41.638 align:start position:0%
executive session we are in in house
 
05:33:45.350 --> 05:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
session tomorrow next week on the 19th
 
05:33:47.070 --> 05:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
we have a couple of hearings in the
 
05:33:49.190 --> 05:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
morning and then an executive session in
 
05:33:49.200 --> 05:34:06.708 align:start position:0%
morning and then an executive session in
the

05:34:06.708 --> 05:34:06.718 align:start position:0%
