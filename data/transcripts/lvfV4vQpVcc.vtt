00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 align:start position:0%
welcome to day two the governor's
 
00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:32.079 align:start position:0%
capital budget hearing my name is james
 
00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 align:start position:0%
gary i'm the state's budget director
 
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
for those of you who were not here
 
00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
yesterday how this works is we're going
 
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 align:start position:0%
to call you up uh at your scheduled time
 
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 align:start position:0%
uh because this is a noticed meeting
 
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
that we cannot put you on before your
 
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
schedule time so if things
 
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
and quicker than the schedule
 
00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 align:start position:0%
predicted then we just take a few minute
 
00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
break between sessions
 
00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 align:start position:0%
so if you're here thinking well if it
 
00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:02.079 align:start position:0%
goes quicker
 
00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 align:start position:0%
i should be there you don't have to be
 
00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 align:start position:0%
so just be there at your appointed time
 
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
it'll either be that or maybe a few
 
00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 align:start position:0%
minutes later but we try to stick on
 
00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.229 align:start position:0%
minutes later but we try to stick on
schedule

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 align:start position:0%
schedule
 
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
so with that i'd like to start
 
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
with our first presentation which will
 
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
be from the department of environmental
 
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:25.270 align:start position:0%
be from the department of environmental
services

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
good morning for the record i'm bob
 
00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
scott commissioner with the department
 
00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
of environmental services uh with me is
 
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
susan carlson our chief operating
 
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
officer and uh
 
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
nice to meet you in person
 
00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 align:start position:0%
nice to meet you as well
 
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 align:start position:0%
so so you should have some handouts from
 
00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 align:start position:0%
the department uh if uh if it's the will
 
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
of the the group here i will uh briefly
 
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
summarize each each uh section
 
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.550 align:start position:0%
summarize each each uh section
uh

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 align:start position:0%
so the first section i'd like to to talk
 
00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
about is our request for it
 
00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.390 align:start position:0%
about is our request for it
infrastructure

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh we have uh
 
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
really five subsets of that
 
00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 align:start position:0%
the major subset is a what we're calling
 
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
phase two or a continuation of the work
 
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
we're doing on consolidating our
 
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
over 200 separate databases and one
 
00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 align:start position:0%
million documents that we have for the
 
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
department uh we currently are going
 
00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
through phase one right now which is the
 
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
less than glamorous work of getting
 
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 align:start position:0%
everything formatted in consistent ways
 
00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 align:start position:0%
so that they can talk that there can be
 
00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
linkages with the databases
 
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh we're very interested in taking that
 
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
to the next phase in order to provide
 
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh more transparent service to our many
 
00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 align:start position:0%
customers uh so the one stop just to
 
00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:42.159 align:start position:0%
give you some background we've
 
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
a couple times we've had it's had to be
 
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
offline for for various reasons
 
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
uh to improve it one of them was for
 
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
cyber security vulnerabilities um and we
 
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
immediately got
 
00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 align:start position:0%
many many calls from from both citizens
 
00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 align:start position:0%
looking to to look at environmental data
 
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
but also for a lot of consultants a lot
 
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
of industry work goes on they depend on
 
00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
at this point they like the online
 
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
service that that provides rather than
 
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
having to come in and look at documents
 
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
directly uh so for for many reasons
 
00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 align:start position:0%
we're very interested in that uh
 
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
that work uh
 
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
to move ahead on our our customer
 
00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
service if you will
 
00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:23.759 align:start position:0%
so that cuts a lot of ways it also uh
 
00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 align:start position:0%
is less impactful to staff as we move
 
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
forward also the other another part of
 
00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 align:start position:0%
this request is for
 
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
our ongoing work to upgrade our air
 
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 align:start position:0%
monitoring stations so we have a
 
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
network of a dozen stations throughout
 
00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.270 align:start position:0%
network of a dozen stations throughout
the

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
state where we might measure different
 
00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
air quality aspects and we report that
 
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 align:start position:0%
to our
 
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
citizenry as well as the federal
 
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
government uh so you may occasionally
 
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
it's less
 
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
prevalent thankfully for new hampshire
 
00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 align:start position:0%
now but occasionally you hear about it
 
00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 align:start position:0%
our air quality action day and that's
 
00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
that's coming off that network uh so we
 
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
we are continuing to to want to do
 
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
upgrades to that to make that more
 
00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:05.990 align:start position:0%
upgrades to that to make that more
efficient

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
efficient
 
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh we're also part of this request now
 
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
is to include a mobile calibration
 
00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
unit uh with the march of technology
 
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
where we're looking at what we're
 
00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
calling microtype stations
 
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
which will basically be a lot more cost
 
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
effective and less energy used etc
 
00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
the only downside which i don't think is
 
00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 align:start position:0%
a downside is
 
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
there's no room in the the structure to
 
00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039 align:start position:0%
actually co-locate calibration equipment
 
00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039 align:start position:0%
so we want to move to the next
 
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
level of that and have a mobile
 
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
unit that can do the calibrations and
 
00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
not have separate calibration equipment
 
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
at the different sites
 
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.070 align:start position:0%
at the different sites
uh

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
the next issue we'd like to address
 
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
through it is our subsurface program
 
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
which is code for septic tanks
 
00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
we have over 48 years of
 
00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
hard paper records that
 
00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
the public needs to get at the
 
00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
installers need to get at our staff need
 
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
to get at
 
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
that needs to be digitized so that would
 
00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:09.759 align:start position:0%
be a that that service would be of great
 
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
value to pretty much everybody who's
 
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
involved with that type of work
 
00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:14.710 align:start position:0%
involved with that type of work
work

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039 align:start position:0%
um and then our
 
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
limnology lab uh is uh
 
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
all the work that that's done in the
 
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
field that comes back for lab analysis
 
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh is all currently in a a single access
 
00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:31.600 align:start position:0%
which is uh an old microsoft product uh
 
00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
database uh that is not not pretty
 
00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:36.639 align:start position:0%
particularly functional
 
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
again just like our one stop data we
 
00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
want the public our staff to be able to
 
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
readily access
 
00:06:44.309 --> 00:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
uh that and
 
00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
that needs updating
 
00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
and finally our pools and spa program uh
 
00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:49.990 align:start position:0%
and finally our pools and spa program uh
which

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh we had legislation to revamp that
 
00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:53.759 align:start position:0%
unfortunately as a result of uh
 
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
legionella outbreak of uh back in
 
00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.230 align:start position:0%
legionella outbreak of uh back in
2018-19

00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
2018-19
 
00:07:00.309 --> 00:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
at uh hampton beach where we had some
 
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
deaths caused by
 
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
improperly maintained
 
00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.990 align:start position:0%
improperly maintained
spas

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
spas
 
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
so that's right now we have a single
 
00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:10.639 align:start position:0%
database and only one person at a time
 
00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
can actually access we want to have that
 
00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
so again the public can access it the
 
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
towns can do
 
00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
do some of this work for inspections so
 
00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
that they can access it uh and certainly
 
00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
so the public can online register online
 
00:07:26.469 --> 00:07:26.479 align:start position:0%
and do their certification so
 
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
that's in need of work also so that's
 
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
part of that it request
 
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
item that you see
 
00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:33.919 align:start position:0%
the next item is the groundwater
 
00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
monitoring well expansion
 
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
so we have a network of
 
00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.950 align:start position:0%
so we have a network of
30

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
30
 
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
groundwater monitoring stations
 
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
throughout the state we use this the
 
00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
data from that to help us
 
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
predict and
 
00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
monitor drought conditions especially
 
00:07:52.869 --> 00:07:52.879 align:start position:0%
uh what's
 
00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
come of that uh the the past two years
 
00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
we've we've seen severe droughts uh in
 
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
especially the north country
 
00:08:02.309 --> 00:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
and now we're seeing actually we're
 
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
currently in um
 
00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
lower moderate drought conditions in the
 
00:08:09.199 --> 00:08:10.629 align:start position:0%
lower moderate drought conditions in the
seacoast

00:08:10.629 --> 00:08:10.639 align:start position:0%
seacoast
 
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
those two areas are
 
00:08:14.869 --> 00:08:14.879 align:start position:0%
are we have gaps in that system so we
 
00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
don't have as many monitoring wells and
 
00:08:17.909 --> 00:08:17.919 align:start position:0%
the monitoring wells we have by and
 
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:20.240 align:start position:0%
large are not bedrock wells that we
 
00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
actually need to see so we're
 
00:08:24.469 --> 00:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
envisioning uh kind of filling those
 
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:26.720 align:start position:0%
gaps and that will allow us to help work
 
00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
with the public work with
 
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
impacted communities on a more timely
 
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.709 align:start position:0%
impacted communities on a more timely
basis

00:08:32.709 --> 00:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
basis
 
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
for drug conditions
 
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:39.200 align:start position:0%
the third issue we have is for
 
00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
the israel river uh
 
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:44.240 align:start position:0%
ice control structure and and uh we've
 
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
lumped that with which is a half million
 
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
dollars we've lumped that with a
 
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
hydrologic data collection network which
 
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
is i'll start with that one that is
 
00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:53.750 align:start position:0%
is i'll start with that one that is
basically

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:56.240 align:start position:0%
allowing us to do further automation and
 
00:08:58.630 --> 00:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
and uh understanding of our
 
00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.670 align:start position:0%
and uh understanding of our
uh

00:08:59.670 --> 00:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
flow conditions and uh to help help
 
00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:04.959 align:start position:0%
manage the dams better and also be more
 
00:09:07.509 --> 00:09:07.519 align:start position:0%
predictive on flood conditions uh so
 
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
that's what that upgrade is is about uh
 
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:10.790 align:start position:0%
that's what that upgrade is is about uh
the

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
israel ice river control structure is in
 
00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
lancaster that's a there's a long story
 
00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:18.320 align:start position:0%
history with that it's actually army
 
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
corps of engineers installed it never
 
00:09:23.269 --> 00:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
quite worked as it was envisioned it's
 
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
not been maintained and now we're at the
 
00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
point now where uh thankfully for d.o.t
 
00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:28.790 align:start position:0%
point now where uh thankfully for d.o.t
is

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
the bridge downstream of that is now
 
00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
large enough so it doesn't clog ice dams
 
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
and between
 
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
the the lack of maintenance uh being in
 
00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
disrepair and the the bridge taking away
 
00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
the issue it's we're ready to have that
 
00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
removed um
 
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
right now it's both a public safety
 
00:09:48.389 --> 00:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
hazard and it is supposed to control ice
 
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
it actually collects ice so that's a bad
 
00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:53.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
the fourth and fifth
 
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
items are
 
00:09:59.030 --> 00:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
our state revolving loan fund match for
 
00:10:01.269 --> 00:10:01.279 align:start position:0%
clean water which is code for waste
 
00:10:02.949 --> 00:10:02.959 align:start position:0%
water and storm water
 
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
and drinking water
 
00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
so those are long-standing programs
 
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh typically we have uh requests in to
 
00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
match there's always a match requirement
 
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
for the federal money that comes in
 
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
the difference this year is with the
 
00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
infrastructure bill
 
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
there's a significant increase in the
 
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:22.720 align:start position:0%
amount of match uh
 
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
needed because they're giving us a lot
 
00:10:25.829 --> 00:10:25.839 align:start position:0%
more money
 
00:10:28.069 --> 00:10:28.079 align:start position:0%
and i think we all agree that
 
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
this is this is money well spent as far
 
00:10:31.269 --> 00:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
as we don't want to be giving federal
 
00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
money back
 
00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
uh the good news too is the the first
 
00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
tranche of that the 2223
 
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
only requires 10 match rather than the
 
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
traditional 20 match
 
00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
uh but that's what that request is so i
 
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:46.720 align:start position:0%
do want to point out that uh house bill
 
00:10:49.509 --> 00:10:49.519 align:start position:0%
4 1421 which was
 
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
amended after we had submitted this
 
00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
includes uh 7.6 7.76 million dollars
 
00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
out of the state surplus to match so
 
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
assuming that signed which i have no
 
00:11:05.509 --> 00:11:05.519 align:start position:0%
reason to believe it's not going to be
 
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
then that request can come down by that
 
00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.829 align:start position:0%
then that request can come down by that
7.76

00:11:09.829 --> 00:11:09.839 align:start position:0%
7.76
 
00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
the next item on our list is the uh
 
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
baker flood control dam uh
 
00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation uh that is a uh
 
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
again it's an older dam as i guess you
 
00:11:25.269 --> 00:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
could say that about almost all of our
 
00:11:28.069 --> 00:11:28.079 align:start position:0%
over 200 dams we maintain
 
00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
and that was originally built by the
 
00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:32.240 align:start position:0%
natural resources conservation service
 
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
they have a program where they
 
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
will help pay
 
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
both some of the assessment and
 
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
engineering design work but also
 
00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
they'll pay up to 65 percent of the
 
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation cost
 
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
this is a case where originally the work
 
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:48.160 align:start position:0%
was scheduled to be done in 2016
 
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh and we had we had some funds 3.9
 
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
million appropriated then
 
00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:54.839 align:start position:0%
in the march of
 
00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
time and
 
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
and the damn deteriorating uh now the
 
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
cost now that now that the feds are
 
00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
ready for that uh the cost has increased
 
00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:07.829 align:start position:0%
ready for that uh the cost has increased
so

00:12:07.829 --> 00:12:07.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
uh between the 3.9 million appropriation
 
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
we have already uh and what the feds are
 
00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
putting in their 65 percent we still
 
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
need uh an additional 11.8 percent uh
 
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
million dollars uh fit for that um
 
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
numbers our seventh uh request is for
 
00:12:26.949 --> 00:12:26.959 align:start position:0%
the winnipesaukee river basin
 
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
uh so just a reminder that we
 
00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
run and manage that program we run the
 
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
wastewater facility and the collection
 
00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.629 align:start position:0%
wastewater facility and the collection
lines

00:12:36.629 --> 00:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
lines
 
00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
for those 10 communities that are
 
00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.269 align:start position:0%
for those 10 communities that are
involved

00:12:39.269 --> 00:12:39.279 align:start position:0%
involved
 
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
they are this is a
 
00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
user service there's no general fund
 
00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
monies in here and there's no bonding
 
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
for state monies here uh but it does
 
00:12:49.829 --> 00:12:49.839 align:start position:0%
obviously being a state state thing it
 
00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
goes through through you all so they are
 
00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
looking to re
 
00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:55.519 align:start position:0%
as part of their
 
00:12:55.519 --> 00:12:56.470 align:start position:0%
as part of their
normal

00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
normal
 
00:12:58.949 --> 00:12:58.959 align:start position:0%
upgrades and replacing of old lines that
 
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
are breaking uh they're looking at two
 
00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:02.959 align:start position:0%
and a half miles of force main to be
 
00:13:05.829 --> 00:13:05.839 align:start position:0%
replaced on route 140 in belmont and
 
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
about 1300 feet of force main in laconia
 
00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.069 align:start position:0%
about 1300 feet of force main in laconia
and

00:13:12.069 --> 00:13:12.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
our last
 
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
did i miss one here
 
00:13:17.829 --> 00:13:17.839 align:start position:0%
i guess not no i guess i didn't uh so
 
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
our last request has to do with our
 
00:13:23.829 --> 00:13:23.839 align:start position:0%
office space and our modular furniture
 
00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:27.200 align:start position:0%
most of our wings on a floor on hazen
 
00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.230 align:start position:0%
most of our wings on a floor on hazen
drive

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:28.240 align:start position:0%
drive
 
00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
have been converted to module furniture
 
00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
in order to maximize usable space for
 
00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:34.949 align:start position:0%
in order to maximize usable space for
staff

00:13:34.949 --> 00:13:34.959 align:start position:0%
staff
 
00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:36.959 align:start position:0%
in the march of time and especially with
 
00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure monies we have a fair
 
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:40.720 align:start position:0%
number of temporary positions that we've
 
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
had to add and we'll be adding
 
00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:44.629 align:start position:0%
had to add and we'll be adding
and

00:13:44.629 --> 00:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
we don't want to be
 
00:13:49.189 --> 00:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
leasing more space for that
 
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
we'd like to convert
 
00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
we have one floor that's not
 
00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
converted to work stations now so
 
00:13:57.829 --> 00:13:57.839 align:start position:0%
that will allow us to maximize that
 
00:13:57.839 --> 00:13:58.710 align:start position:0%
that will allow us to maximize that
floor

00:13:58.710 --> 00:13:58.720 align:start position:0%
floor
 
00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh by adding module furniture to that
 
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
that space
 
00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
so with that again i i can certainly go
 
00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:05.590 align:start position:0%
so with that again i i can certainly go
into

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
as much detail as the group would like i
 
00:14:14.829 --> 00:14:14.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
representative um thank you
 
00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:18.959 align:start position:0%
other than
 
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
winnipesaukee is all the rest of this
 
00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
it would be very helpful if you
 
00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
differentiated that
 
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
because when you start looking at a 50
 
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
million dollar plus or minus request
 
00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:38.120 align:start position:0%
out of 100 and i think the governor said
 
00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
125 million yesterday
 
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
so which are general funds and which are
 
00:14:46.389 --> 00:14:46.399 align:start position:0%
other funds
 
00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
would be helpful i think for anybody
 
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
who's trying to put this
 
00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
whole package together
 
00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
the only other one besides winnie is the
 
00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:58.240 align:start position:0%
baker flood control damn rehabilitation
 
00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:02.079 align:start position:0%
it's 65 federal 35 percent staked
 
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
all the rest of the requests are general
 
00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
or straight as straight-up general funds
 
00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
our ask is on the total
 
00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
so we would be um of that total 7.8
 
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
million is federal for the baker river
 
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:22.240 align:start position:0%
6.7 million for when vasaki is other
 
00:15:24.829 --> 00:15:24.839 align:start position:0%
funded and the balance is all general
 
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
funds thank you
 
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
for your
 
00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
fourth and fifth clean water and
 
00:15:33.269 --> 00:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
drinking water you have roughly 38
 
00:15:35.189 --> 00:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
million of general fund revenue with i
 
00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
believe 281 million of federal funds
 
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:38.240 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
00:15:39.269 --> 00:15:39.279 align:start position:0%
could you just
 
00:15:40.949 --> 00:15:40.959 align:start position:0%
briefly because we you know as you point
 
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
out the time is limited
 
00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
talk about what specifically that money
 
00:15:45.749 --> 00:15:45.759 align:start position:0%
is going for what what are you
 
00:15:45.759 --> 00:15:46.870 align:start position:0%
is going for what what are you
purchasing

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
purchasing
 
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
with that uh 310 million roughly
 
00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
sure again this is match money for uh
 
00:15:56.069 --> 00:15:56.079 align:start position:0%
federal state revolving loan funds so
 
00:15:58.069 --> 00:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
uh this provides
 
00:15:59.350 --> 00:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
low interest loans and with the
 
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
infrastructure bill uh depending on the
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
community it can be up to 49 loan
 
00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
forgiveness is always a certain amount
 
00:16:09.509 --> 00:16:09.519 align:start position:0%
of loan forgiveness so these are
 
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
drinking water projects so it could be
 
00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
upgrades to
 
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
treatment plants it could be upgrades to
 
00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
pipes it could be new pipes same thing
 
00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.430 align:start position:0%
pipes it could be new pipes same thing
for

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment
 
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
this sounds like a lot of money
 
00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:23.519 align:start position:0%
our assessment which it is
 
00:16:25.269 --> 00:16:25.279 align:start position:0%
our assessment though for the needs in
 
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
the state is over two billion dollars
 
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
so it's all relative i guess right
 
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:36.069 --> 00:16:36.079 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you for coming in
 
00:16:38.629 --> 00:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
morning um on your i.t infrastructure
 
00:16:38.639 --> 00:16:39.670 align:start position:0%
morning um on your i.t infrastructure
plan

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
are are all of these um you know
 
00:16:45.749 --> 00:16:45.759 align:start position:0%
individual items working under the you
 
00:16:48.829 --> 00:16:48.839 align:start position:0%
know an umbrella of this of some
 
00:16:52.629 --> 00:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
system or are these all individual
 
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
so a few things i'll point out since
 
00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.069 align:start position:0%
so a few things i'll point out since
dennis's

00:16:56.069 --> 00:16:56.079 align:start position:0%
dennis's
 
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner goulet is sitting next to
 
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
you we work very closely with the doit
 
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
as part of our overall plans and we we
 
00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:06.079 align:start position:0%
make sure what we're doing matches uh
 
00:17:08.549 --> 00:17:08.559 align:start position:0%
their assessments of the needs also uh
 
00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:10.959 align:start position:0%
and then we also have a planning unit we
 
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
set up within the department so we we
 
00:17:14.949 --> 00:17:14.959 align:start position:0%
are able to prioritize and make sure
 
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
it's within the scope of the department
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
and uh for whatever better words that
 
00:17:21.669 --> 00:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
way that that prevents what we hope
 
00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:23.839 align:start position:0%
those two things prevents the left hand
 
00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
not knowing what the right hand doing
 
00:17:26.309 --> 00:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
because at the end of the day we want a
 
00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
combined system that works all together
 
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
with and including with a long term
 
00:17:32.549 --> 00:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
whatever the state ends up doing if you
 
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
will i i guess my question is um
 
00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:38.799 align:start position:0%
you you're asking for a request for
 
00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
phase two does that does that have
 
00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
anything to do with digitizing
 
00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
historical subsurface documents
 
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
we've broken that out
 
00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:48.950 align:start position:0%
we've broken that out
right

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
so i i guess my question then is
 
00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:52.789 align:start position:0%
so i i guess my question then is
um

00:17:52.789 --> 00:17:52.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
this is coming in as one ask for 6.5
 
00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.830 align:start position:0%
this is coming in as one ask for 6.5
million

00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:17:58.870 --> 00:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
could you
 
00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:05.990 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
if it's possible that
 
00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
you know you could
 
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
be funded for some but not all
 
00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:18.160 align:start position:0%
yes in our um in our original submittal
 
00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
um the um
 
00:18:22.549 --> 00:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
we had a detailed memo explaining each
 
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
piece of it
 
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
um the one stop phase two is 5 million
 
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
fifty one thousand
 
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
the air monitoring is three hundred and
 
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
ninety six thousand
 
00:18:37.029 --> 00:18:37.039 align:start position:0%
um the digitizing of the subsurface
 
00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
documents is estimated at eight hundred
 
00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
and the updates to the laboratory and
 
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
pools and spas is 300 000 in each of
 
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
those individually 150.
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.029 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:18:57.029 --> 00:18:57.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:58.789 --> 00:18:58.799 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for that that's actually
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
very helpful to to see the line items
 
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
and it is a very detailed memo
 
00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:04.470 align:start position:0%
and it is a very detailed memo
um

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:06.789 --> 00:19:06.799 align:start position:0%
my question is about the srf matches am
 
00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
i right those are
 
00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.510 align:start position:0%
i right those are
um

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
this isn't in your best interest to
 
00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
answer correctly but um are they
 
00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.350 align:start position:0%
answer correctly but um are they
scalable

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
scalable
 
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
that is to say we can
 
00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
you know if we did and i'm not
 
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
suggesting this but we did half of it we
 
00:19:21.909 --> 00:19:21.919 align:start position:0%
would get half the federal money if we
 
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
did two thirds of it we get two thirds
 
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
of federal money
 
00:19:27.029 --> 00:19:27.039 align:start position:0%
correct uh and again and you have a
 
00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
backlog of like 2 billion and this would
 
00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
get you 300 million of that 2 billion
 
00:19:33.669 --> 00:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
right right and again the the we is the
 
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
communities and the water systems this
 
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
is money that we don't keep it goes out
 
00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
to the water systems for projects
 
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
and it's um
 
00:19:43.029 --> 00:19:43.039 align:start position:0%
you said there's a backlog of about two
 
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
two billion are those literally
 
00:19:47.909 --> 00:19:47.919 align:start position:0%
identified projects or
 
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
no that was an assessment with that
 
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
without going without going into
 
00:19:54.789 --> 00:19:54.799 align:start position:0%
gee we need to expand here for future
 
00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:57.039 align:start position:0%
development but with just the existing
 
00:19:59.830 --> 00:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
infrastructure we have that that was the
 
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:01.919 align:start position:0%
the current assessment of the needs you
 
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
know again
 
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
not to go in too much detail but
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
you know when there's a geyser on main
 
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
street is not probably the the most cost
 
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
effective way to fix that but we know
 
00:20:13.029 --> 00:20:13.039 align:start position:0%
the condition and that type of thing so
 
00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
we work with the community so that's
 
00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
basically a an assessment but not uh not
 
00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh here's itemized people are ready to
 
00:20:22.549 --> 00:20:22.559 align:start position:0%
give us anything
 
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
if i could we did uh
 
00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
we do an annual
 
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh solicitation for pre-applications
 
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
last year we got
 
00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
just for people ready to actually
 
00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
execute then we had
 
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
over a billion dollars in requests for
 
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
applications last year
 
00:20:41.669 --> 00:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
nice um
 
00:20:41.679 --> 00:20:42.870 align:start position:0%
nice um
uh

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
how does this dovetail it all into the
 
00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:46.390 align:start position:0%
how does this dovetail it all into the
um

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
you know the state through the through
 
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
the drinking water trust or whatever
 
00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
whatever we call that i don't remember
 
00:20:53.909 --> 00:20:53.919 align:start position:0%
anymore sure um is sort of expanding and
 
00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
improving the state's
 
00:20:58.149 --> 00:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
drinking water infrastructure and
 
00:21:00.549 --> 00:21:00.559 align:start position:0%
more pipes fewer wells probably but um
 
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
does this dovetail a little bit with
 
00:21:04.149 --> 00:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
that it does the same our staff work
 
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
very closely we have the drinking water
 
00:21:07.909 --> 00:21:07.919 align:start position:0%
groundwater trust fund which thankfully
 
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
can be used to do things that this srf
 
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
can't do like expanding for economic
 
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
development that type of thing uh we
 
00:21:18.149 --> 00:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
have been using arpa money and matching
 
00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
the srf to make it go farther also so
 
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
we've been sending up that solicitation
 
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
for a billion dollars we've been with
 
00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
the amount of money we have which is not
 
00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
as much we've been sending and we have
 
00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
right now we have 233 offers out to
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
different communities saying here's
 
00:21:35.669 --> 00:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
here's good news you asked for this much
 
00:21:36.789 --> 00:21:36.799 align:start position:0%
alone we're going to be able to give you
 
00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
this much an arpa grant and this much in
 
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
the loan to kind of make it go farther
 
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
so so
 
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
to answer your question the same staff
 
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
are all working together so some
 
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
communities gee what you want to do you
 
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
really can't use this funds but you can
 
00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
use that fund so we're we're kind of
 
00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
leveraging that and we strongly
 
00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
encourage them also take advantage of
 
00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
other funding like
 
00:21:58.390 --> 00:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
royal development funds or northern
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
borders and kind of do a mix and match
 
00:22:04.149 --> 00:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
do you have a sense of the the
 
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
this is an unfair question i'll preface
 
00:22:07.669 --> 00:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
it by saying that do you have a sense of
 
00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
the total value of the state
 
00:22:13.029 --> 00:22:13.039 align:start position:0%
the combined uh
 
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
capital worth of the state um
 
00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
water infrastructure
 
00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:18.789 align:start position:0%
water infrastructure
no

00:22:18.789 --> 00:22:18.799 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:22:18.799 --> 00:22:20.149 align:start position:0%
no
okay

00:22:20.149 --> 00:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
but a lot more than two billion
 
00:22:27.909 --> 00:22:27.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
good morning i have two two questions
 
00:22:32.549 --> 00:22:32.559 align:start position:0%
one you had said that this request this
 
00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
is on the clean water drinking water as
 
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
well um that this is an increase over
 
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
the last biennium
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
primarily as a result of the federal
 
00:22:40.549 --> 00:22:40.559 align:start position:0%
infrastructure bill
 
00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
this request totals around 38 million of
 
00:22:44.549 --> 00:22:44.559 align:start position:0%
just those two how much of of an
 
00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
increase is that over the last capital
 
00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
budget request
 
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.190 align:start position:0%
budget request
good

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
any estimate on that
 
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
it's more than double okay i
 
00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
essentially we are getting um
 
00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
more than the supplemental
 
00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:01.919 align:start position:0%
funds we're getting through the
 
00:23:03.909 --> 00:23:03.919 align:start position:0%
infrastructure bill as more than double
 
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
our normal grants
 
00:23:08.789 --> 00:23:08.799 align:start position:0%
and then my second part is on the second
 
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
bullet it talks about that the committed
 
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
funds must be identified prior to epa
 
00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
awarding the grants what's their
 
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
timeline that you have to have those
 
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
projects in so they could do those
 
00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
awards is there a set time at a certain
 
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
point in a year there is a set time but
 
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
it's based on the federal budget and the
 
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
federal budget right now is
 
00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
not done
 
00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
and on a timely basis so it varies
 
00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
so um we are right now on the fy 22
 
00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:37.919 align:start position:0%
we have exactly three months left before
 
00:23:39.909 --> 00:23:39.919 align:start position:0%
we lose those funds
 
00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:45.269 --> 00:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
i'd like to
 
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
invite commissioner mason and fish and
 
00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:52.630 align:start position:0%
invite commissioner mason and fish and
game

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:52.640 align:start position:0%

director scott mason new hampshire
 
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
fishing game i brought with me um
 
00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:27.039 align:start position:0%
josh davis uh chief of our facilities
 
00:24:29.269 --> 00:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
and lands division
 
00:24:29.279 --> 00:24:33.669 align:start position:0%
and lands division
um

00:24:33.669 --> 00:24:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
bro we would like to request a million
 
00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
dollars for our for design
 
00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
of our final hatchery construction
 
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
project that we've begun
 
00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
um we have
 
00:24:47.269 --> 00:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
applied and received 55 million dollars
 
00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
of opera money already
 
00:24:52.549 --> 00:24:52.559 align:start position:0%
to construct two hatcheries
 
00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:54.799 align:start position:0%
um that will bring us
 
00:24:57.909 --> 00:24:57.919 align:start position:0%
um we the plan was is that we would
 
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
finish up constructing a third hatchery
 
00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
and re and rebuilding a fourth hatchery
 
00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:05.590 align:start position:0%
and re and rebuilding a fourth hatchery
um

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
so at this point we would like to
 
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
request a million dollars to do that
 
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
final design work on those two
 
00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:13.750 align:start position:0%
final design work on those two
hatcheries

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
hatcheries
 
00:25:15.909 --> 00:25:15.919 align:start position:0%
we've also requesting two hundred
 
00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for our hatchery
 
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
infrastructure improvements
 
00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.630 align:start position:0%
infrastructure improvements
um

00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
we will be building
 
00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
our hatcheries are fairly well worn out
 
00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
and for example this year we spent about
 
00:25:30.549 --> 00:25:30.559 align:start position:0%
265 000 on major repairs at our
 
00:25:30.559 --> 00:25:31.669 align:start position:0%
265 000 on major repairs at our
hatcheries

00:25:31.669 --> 00:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
hatcheries
 
00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
and basically we're trying to change the
 
00:25:37.029 --> 00:25:37.039 align:start position:0%
tire without stopping the car as we roll
 
00:25:39.269 --> 00:25:39.279 align:start position:0%
down the road we're trying to maintain
 
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
our production as we go so we know that
 
00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
we will have some major repair work to
 
00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:45.190 align:start position:0%
we will have some major repair work to
keep

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:45.200 align:start position:0%
keep
 
00:25:47.909 --> 00:25:47.919 align:start position:0%
the existing hatcheries in production as
 
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
we construct new hatcheries to replace
 
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:50.789 align:start position:0%
we construct new hatcheries to replace
them

00:25:50.789 --> 00:25:50.799 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:25:53.269 --> 00:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
um our the two the two that will be
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
building uh the finish date is
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
anticipated being december of
 
00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:01.430 align:start position:0%
anticipated being december of
2026.

00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh the next request is for 250 000
 
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
for headquarters roof repair
 
00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
like some other state buildings we have
 
00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
some major leaks in our roof at our
 
00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
headquarters building and um
 
00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
we would like to get the trash cans out
 
00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
of the hallway and and um try to fix you
 
00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
know try to get the roof leaks fixed
 
00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
we also have had a problem at our gibner
 
00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
center the hugh greg coastal
 
00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
conservation center down
 
00:26:31.029 --> 00:26:31.039 align:start position:0%
uh in greenland
 
00:26:31.039 --> 00:26:31.909 align:start position:0%
uh in greenland
um

00:26:31.909 --> 00:26:31.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
that was built with a
 
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
heat pump
 
00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:37.190 align:start position:0%
heat pump
system

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:26:39.909 --> 00:26:39.919 align:start position:0%
and and two of those pumps have failed
 
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
and we believe the third one is aging to
 
00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
the point where it would make sense to
 
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
replace all three
 
00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
and then our last request is for fifty
 
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to go in and replace
 
00:26:51.669 --> 00:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
what we call a coast guard dock which is
 
00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
where we
 
00:26:55.669 --> 00:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
um house our boats that we use on the
 
00:26:55.679 --> 00:26:57.990 align:start position:0%
um house our boats that we use on the
ocean

00:26:57.990 --> 00:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
ocean
 
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
00:27:01.909 --> 00:27:01.919 align:start position:0%
yeah i have
 
00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
one with with on the hatcheries with the
 
00:27:06.549 --> 00:27:06.559 align:start position:0%
aging hatcheries and the problems you've
 
00:27:06.559 --> 00:27:07.430 align:start position:0%
aging hatcheries and the problems you've
had

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:27:08.789 --> 00:27:08.799 align:start position:0%
in in
 
00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
maintaining them because of their age
 
00:27:12.549 --> 00:27:12.559 align:start position:0%
have you noticed or have the state
 
00:27:15.269 --> 00:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
notice any drop in production
 
00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
from them that would be noticeable to an
 
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
avid fisherman
 
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
well so far we've been able to
 
00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
get there fast enough to fix problems
 
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
that would create those types of drastic
 
00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
drops in production um this year our big
 
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
issue were wells you know well you know
 
00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
well pump failures and working with our
 
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
contractor we were able to to keep the
 
00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
wells running and keep the water flowing
 
00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
so no we have not directly from
 
00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
equipment failure one of the big
 
00:27:47.669 --> 00:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
problems we have at our hatcheries right
 
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
now and have continued to have as pre as
 
00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:51.750 align:start position:0%
now and have continued to have as pre as
predators

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
predators
 
00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
there's a family of otters over in new
 
00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
durham that are quite happy and fat
 
00:27:57.669 --> 00:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
right now and eight six thousand trout
 
00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
inside of a week
 
00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:05.909 align:start position:0%
inside of a week
wow

00:28:05.909 --> 00:28:05.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
other than the um hatchery design all
 
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
the rest of the the items you listed are
 
00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
going to be funded
 
00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
fish and game fund okay and but
 
00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
in a follow-on to the hatchery
 
00:28:22.389 --> 00:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
if you get the million dollars the
 
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
assumption then is that the legislature
 
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
and the following biennium will pony up
 
00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
30 plus million dollars
 
00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
can you um can you talk a little bit
 
00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
about um if i understand what you said
 
00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:44.630 align:start position:0%
about um if i understand what you said
before

00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
and i'm ignoring the fish and game fund
 
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
pieces and focusing on the hatcheries um
 
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
you're getting 55 million of arpa funds
 
00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
a million would be for design
 
00:28:58.870 --> 00:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
and your estimate is that at that point
 
00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
you're about probably 30 million short
 
00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
although we'd know more from design does
 
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
that mean that design and construction
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
and replacement of the hatcheries is a
 
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
total of about
 
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
about 85 million then you're about
 
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
halfway there that's what we're
 
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
predicting right now it'll be a total of
 
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
about 85 million we're still in the
 
00:29:18.549 --> 00:29:18.559 align:start position:0%
process um
 
00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
last year
 
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
we received a million dollars to do
 
00:29:24.149 --> 00:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
technology research
 
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
the issue came the the issue at hand is
 
00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
is that epa set our discharge permit or
 
00:29:32.149 --> 00:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
neptune's permit at 12 parts per billion
 
00:29:34.149 --> 00:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
that's to my knowledge that's the lowest
 
00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
that they've ever issued anywhere in the
 
00:29:37.029 --> 00:29:37.039 align:start position:0%
united states
 
00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
and we're in the process of trying to
 
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
make sure before you know before we
 
00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
build whether or not if we can meet that
 
00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
type of a discharge uh so we're actually
 
00:29:47.909 --> 00:29:47.919 align:start position:0%
doing some pilot we're beginning some
 
00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
pilot studies right now at new durham to
 
00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
see what kind of technology and what the
 
00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:57.990 --> 00:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
we may discover that it's going to be
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
too costly to meet those types of a
 
00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
requirement and that would force us to
 
00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
look at
 
00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
moving a hatchery to a new location
 
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
you need to remember these hatcheries
 
00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
you know the youngest one is a little
 
00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
over 50 years um the oldest ones are
 
00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
well over 100 years old
 
00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
when those hatcheries were cited nobody
 
00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
really thought about discharge that was
 
00:30:20.549 --> 00:30:20.559 align:start position:0%
never that was never a thought it was
 
00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
more about you know water source and in
 
00:30:25.029 --> 00:30:25.039 align:start position:0%
the old days in in the early days was
 
00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
also about gravity because you know you
 
00:30:28.389 --> 00:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
just didn't have electricity in some of
 
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
these rural areas um
 
00:30:32.789 --> 00:30:32.799 align:start position:0%
so you know like in new durham we've got
 
00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
a wonderful facility with a wonderful
 
00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
water source and it's completely gravity
 
00:30:37.679 --> 00:30:39.190 align:start position:0%
water source and it's completely gravity
fed

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
fed
 
00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:41.200 align:start position:0%
as i imagine you folks can imagine right
 
00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
now our hatchery in
 
00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
milford is well fed and
 
00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
the electric bill there is climbing uh
 
00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
rather quickly right now um so
 
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
you know it does come out as a balance
 
00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
in a management you know management
 
00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:57.830 align:start position:0%
in a management you know management
issues

00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:30:59.750 --> 00:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
if you were to just to help me sort of
 
00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
understand a couple of questions one is
 
00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
how many hatcheries do you have overall
 
00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:04.630 align:start position:0%
how many hatcheries do you have overall
but

00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:04.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:05.430 align:start position:0%
but
um

00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
to dovetail that in
 
00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:10.240 align:start position:0%
what are you doing with the 55 million
 
00:31:12.389 --> 00:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
what are you not doing without the 30
 
00:31:12.399 --> 00:31:13.750 align:start position:0%
what are you not doing without the 30
million

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
and um just in the back of my mind and
 
00:31:18.389 --> 00:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
this i know this is stupid and i
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that this is probably a dumb
 
00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
question but
 
00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
you're doing a million for design
 
00:31:27.909 --> 00:31:27.919 align:start position:0%
but you're doing 55 million
 
00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
which you're presumably using for some
 
00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
construction too correct wouldn't you
 
00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
have done the design first and it it
 
00:31:35.909 --> 00:31:35.919 align:start position:0%
feels to me like the design which you
 
00:31:37.029 --> 00:31:37.039 align:start position:0%
know let's say it gets approved you
 
00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
won't get it for a year
 
00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:40.640 align:start position:0%
it feels like that's in the middle
 
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
yeah and
 
00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:42.470 align:start position:0%
yeah and
so

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
what's going on
 
00:31:45.029 --> 00:31:45.039 align:start position:0%
we have a million dollars doing the
 
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
research to figure out what the
 
00:31:48.549 --> 00:31:48.559 align:start position:0%
technology is going to be out of that 55
 
00:31:48.559 --> 00:31:49.509 align:start position:0%
technology is going to be out of that 55
million

00:31:49.509 --> 00:31:49.519 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
we will with money in there to design
 
00:31:53.029 --> 00:31:53.039 align:start position:0%
the two hatcheries that we believe will
 
00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
build with that money
 
00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
this third request will be money to
 
00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
design the third and rebuild of the
 
00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
fourth hatchery i believe when we're
 
00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:03.519 align:start position:0%
done we're probably going to have three
 
00:32:05.269 --> 00:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
hatcheries three new hatcheries and one
 
00:32:07.269 --> 00:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
rebuilt hatchery
 
00:32:09.909 --> 00:32:09.919 align:start position:0%
is what our goal is right now
 
00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:15.029 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:32:15.029 --> 00:32:15.039 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:32:23.269 --> 00:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:23.279 --> 00:32:24.870 align:start position:0%

00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
today we'll talk a little bit about our
 
00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:35.519 align:start position:0%
strategic plans and then describe the
 
00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
request in detail
 
00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire veteran home i'm sorry
 
00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
let me introduce matt sorry hi matt
 
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
henry director administrative services
 
00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:33:46.789 --> 00:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire veteran home was
 
00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
founded in 1889 as a home to care for
 
00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:52.640 align:start position:0%
aging civil war veteran population
 
00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
today what we look like is we're a
 
00:33:59.669 --> 00:33:59.679 align:start position:0%
facility that we have a 250 bed capacity
 
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
license wise we are budgeted for 225
 
00:34:06.149 --> 00:34:06.159 align:start position:0%
however due to current limits around
 
00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
staffing as everyone else in long-term
 
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
care and healthcare experiencing our
 
00:34:14.069 --> 00:34:14.079 align:start position:0%
current census is 123 veterans
 
00:34:15.589 --> 00:34:15.599 align:start position:0%
with the staff that we have right now we
 
00:34:17.669 --> 00:34:17.679 align:start position:0%
could probably go to 130 but we would
 
00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
not be able to
 
00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
house more than that safely with quality
 
00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
of care
 
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
unlike other long-term care facilities
 
00:34:26.869 --> 00:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
in the state we are certified by the
 
00:34:28.629 --> 00:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
veterans administration
 
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
most state
 
00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
all other state facilities are cms
 
00:34:32.159 --> 00:34:33.430 align:start position:0%
all other state facilities are cms
certified

00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
certified
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
the va certification provides us with a
 
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
per diem payment uh two different rates
 
00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:41.919 align:start position:0%
one is a basic rate which is a standard
 
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
rate for all veterans and one is called
 
00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
a prevailing rate which is a higher
 
00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
standard of rate based on service
 
00:34:51.109 --> 00:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
related disabilities
 
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
the mission statement of the veterans
 
00:34:54.629 --> 00:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
home hasn't changed for decades it is to
 
00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
provide the best quality of life for
 
00:34:59.190 --> 00:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
for veterans with dignity honor and
 
00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:00.470 align:start position:0%
for veterans with dignity honor and
respect

00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
respect
 
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
the capital budget
 
00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
project request we are presenting this
 
00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
morning will ensure that we can safely
 
00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
care for our veterans and meet this
 
00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:10.230 align:start position:0%
care for our veterans and meet this
mission

00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
our fy 2426 budget invests over four
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
million dollars into critical life
 
00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
safety projects as well invest in our
 
00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:18.790 align:start position:0%
safety projects as well invest in our
capital

00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
capital
 
00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
excuse me our supply and service
 
00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to bring us to into a
 
00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
post-pandemic environment
 
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
my strategic priorities include
 
00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
investing into health life safety
 
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
requirements maintaining our steady flow
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
of the per diem rate
 
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
payments preparedness to bring us into
 
00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
the post-pandemic world and purchasing
 
00:35:41.589 --> 00:35:41.599 align:start position:0%
needed equipment to grow the census when
 
00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
staffing allows us to do so we have
 
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
seven we have six on the file here but
 
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
we have a seventh uh capital budget
 
00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
request that has come up and i will let
 
00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:57.910 --> 00:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
good morning matt henry director of
 
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
administrative services uh what i'll do
 
00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
is i'll skip over the the slide that
 
00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
says current projects if you have any
 
00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
questions i'd be happy to answer those
 
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
but really i wanted to talk about two
 
00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
kind of buckets
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
so the first bucket is state fiscal year
 
00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
24 26 request back in april we submitted
 
00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
to the business supervisor
 
00:36:18.069 --> 00:36:18.079 align:start position:0%
six capital projects that met the
 
00:36:18.079 --> 00:36:19.190 align:start position:0%
six capital projects that met the
commandant

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
commandant
 
00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
strategic priorities
 
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
about a week after we were high-fiving
 
00:36:25.109 --> 00:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
each other because we were happy that
 
00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:26.720 align:start position:0%
the capital budget was submitted we were
 
00:36:29.109 --> 00:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
happy with the all the requests um and
 
00:36:31.589 --> 00:36:31.599 align:start position:0%
our va survey occurred so we had various
 
00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
findings we were pretty pleased with the
 
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
survey in general but one finding that
 
00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:35.910 align:start position:0%
survey in general but one finding that
um

00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
we couldn't wrap our head around was one
 
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
regarding a sprinkler systems in closets
 
00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
so particularly in our tar south area
 
00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
the finding was published in may
 
00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
and we we contested the finding hoping
 
00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
that they'll
 
00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
the va would come to their census um and
 
00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
use a little bit of reasonableness uh to
 
00:36:59.750 --> 00:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
the to the finding uh frankly we lost
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
and frankly the va was right uh so the
 
00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
we we um
 
00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:05.270 align:start position:0%
we we um
our

00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:37:07.829 --> 00:37:07.839 align:start position:0%
thesis statement if you will was that
 
00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
there was a small room exemption for
 
00:37:11.829 --> 00:37:11.839 align:start position:0%
hospitals that we tried to
 
00:37:11.839 --> 00:37:12.790 align:start position:0%
hospitals that we tried to
um

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:13.910 align:start position:0%
um
argue

00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
argue
 
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:15.839 align:start position:0%
the va came back and said hey
 
00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
silly you're not a hospital you're a
 
00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
nursing home you are a home there's
 
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
combustible materials in closets thou
 
00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:23.750 align:start position:0%
combustible materials in closets thou
shalt

00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
shalt
 
00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
install sprinkler systems
 
00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
so the
 
00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
the amended project list is on that
 
00:37:33.109 --> 00:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
state fiscal year 2426 project list
 
00:37:33.119 --> 00:37:34.230 align:start position:0%
state fiscal year 2426 project list
proposed

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:34.829 align:start position:0%
proposed
and

00:37:34.829 --> 00:37:34.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:37.589 --> 00:37:37.599 align:start position:0%
really we wanted to shimmy a number one
 
00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
priority um in installing sprinkler
 
00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
systems building wide so before i uh go
 
00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
into project project detail i just kind
 
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
of wanted to set the stage on why we're
 
00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
coming to you and we did notify the
 
00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:50.720 align:start position:0%
governor's office preemptively
 
00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
i just want to say that the reason why
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
that is now risen to our priority one is
 
00:38:01.829 --> 00:38:01.839 align:start position:0%
that we are certified provisionally
 
00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
right now the va has given us a
 
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
provisional certification which means we
 
00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
will continue to receive our per diem
 
00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
rate payments
 
00:38:11.829 --> 00:38:11.839 align:start position:0%
but we must be fully certified to
 
00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
continue getting those payments which is
 
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
a large portion of our budget so we have
 
00:38:19.829 --> 00:38:19.839 align:start position:0%
to become into compliance with that
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
requirement and again that's why we
 
00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
challenged the requirement um we have
 
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
they have said no you must sprinkler all
 
00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
so obviously our preference is to to not
 
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
throw out our tar self modernization
 
00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
project but we understand that if we if
 
00:38:42.069 --> 00:38:42.079 align:start position:0%
we had to select one uh that is one that
 
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
could possibly be deferred
 
00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
because it's not a life safety project
 
00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
so now i'll go in just briefly um
 
00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
project by project so first i'll i'll
 
00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about the building
 
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
wide sprinkler system upgrade
 
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
so on on the slide
 
00:38:58.950 --> 00:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
it shows the where the sprinkler system
 
00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
should go and where the sprinkler
 
00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
systems are
 
00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
so the fire code does require that we
 
00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
install these sprinkler systems and when
 
00:39:08.069 --> 00:39:08.079 align:start position:0%
doing further investigation throughout
 
00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
the building we realize that
 
00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
our entire building requires sprinkler
 
00:39:15.589 --> 00:39:15.599 align:start position:0%
systems not just the tar self
 
00:39:17.349 --> 00:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
area that the va
 
00:39:17.359 --> 00:39:20.550 align:start position:0%
area that the va
identified

00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
so the next next project is site-wide
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
drainage and water safety improvements i
 
00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
had the privilege of watching yesterday
 
00:39:30.069 --> 00:39:30.079 align:start position:0%
uh um commissioner arlinghau's uh
 
00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
testimony for the department of
 
00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
administrative services and i think he
 
00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
you referenced uh six bucket leak and 12
 
00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
bucket leak
 
00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
so um what what i would argue i'm gonna
 
00:39:42.069 --> 00:39:42.079 align:start position:0%
you're gonna wish that you never uh
 
00:39:43.589 --> 00:39:43.599 align:start position:0%
referenced that right
 
00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
but i think the
 
00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:46.640 align:start position:0%
the way i would describe this is if you
 
00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
have a six bucket leak in that corner of
 
00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
the room six bucket leak on that corner
 
00:39:51.829 --> 00:39:51.839 align:start position:0%
of the room six bucket leak on that
 
00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
corner of the room and a six bucket leak
 
00:39:55.829 --> 00:39:55.839 align:start position:0%
on that corner of the room you have a 24
 
00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
bucket leak
 
00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:00.640 align:start position:0%
the veteran's home has major water
 
00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:02.720 align:start position:0%
issues we have water
 
00:40:04.309 --> 00:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
every time there's a heavy rain storm
 
00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
there's a water there's water issues at
 
00:40:07.589 --> 00:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
another part of the building this
 
00:40:10.069 --> 00:40:10.079 align:start position:0%
capital project really is intended to
 
00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
fix the water problem at a macro level
 
00:40:15.349 --> 00:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
as opposed to a micro level so this will
 
00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
require some investigative work this
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
will require some pretty sophisticated
 
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
design but we really want to take care
 
00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
of it once and for all so these two
 
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
photos show that the photo on the right
 
00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
shows the water protruding from a
 
00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
communication conduit thankfully not
 
00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:33.839 align:start position:0%
electrical but the photo on the left
 
00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
shows an electrical generator that the
 
00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
so the next project is an entryway life
 
00:40:45.589 --> 00:40:45.599 align:start position:0%
safety improvements this is this one's
 
00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
relatively simple it's already designed
 
00:40:49.109 --> 00:40:49.119 align:start position:0%
but the
 
00:40:49.119 --> 00:40:49.829 align:start position:0%
but the
the

00:40:49.829 --> 00:40:49.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
here at the veterans home we have metal
 
00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:54.640 align:start position:0%
roofs in two-thirds of our building and
 
00:40:56.309 --> 00:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
there's hazardous
 
00:40:56.319 --> 00:40:57.670 align:start position:0%
there's hazardous
snow

00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
snow
 
00:40:59.589 --> 00:40:59.599 align:start position:0%
you know snow runoff that happens at
 
00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
each entrance so this is really to
 
00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
construct some entryway protective areas
 
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
so we don't have to use caution tape
 
00:41:10.309 --> 00:41:10.319 align:start position:0%
like we currently do
 
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
the next project is a is really a phase
 
00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
two of a previously approved project for
 
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
2018. it had to do with camera systems
 
00:41:20.309 --> 00:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
and electronic security systems these
 
00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
these badges get us entry into the uh
 
00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
into the veterans home
 
00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
we prioritize camera systems in 2018
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
so we really have a lot more work to do
 
00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
with regard to
 
00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
enhanced security system
 
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
access we want to do our ledoo area
 
00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
currently we have keypads and
 
00:41:39.829 --> 00:41:39.839 align:start position:0%
combination locks as well as
 
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
the next project that i as i mentioned
 
00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
is a candidate for deferment
 
00:41:49.829 --> 00:41:49.839 align:start position:0%
is our tar south modernization project
 
00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
you walk through the veterans home and
 
00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:54.640 align:start position:0%
there are and we're very proud of how
 
00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:56.720 align:start position:0%
the veterans home looks however there's
 
00:41:59.270 --> 00:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
one area into our south that really you
 
00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
walk in and it looks like a hospital and
 
00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
the next project is a medical lift
 
00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
installation this is one phase out of
 
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
many we want to incrementally install
 
00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
ceiling lifts throughout the building
 
00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:17.190 align:start position:0%
ceiling lifts throughout the building
our

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
our admissions committee uh is very
 
00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
concerned with uh admitting residents
 
00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
and frankly they'll they
 
00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
get larger uh when when they're admitted
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
and they
 
00:42:31.109 --> 00:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
become bariatric after after some time
 
00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
so we want to install 11 lists per lifts
 
00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
and the final project
 
00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
is a warehouse and vehicle storage
 
00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:43.109 align:start position:0%
is a warehouse and vehicle storage
building

00:42:43.109 --> 00:42:43.119 align:start position:0%
building
 
00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
our warehouse is undersized it's it's we
 
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
essentially want to double the size of
 
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
our warehouse
 
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
the warehouse was originally constructed
 
00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
as an emergency operations building and
 
00:42:53.829 --> 00:42:53.839 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:42:53.839 --> 00:42:54.870 align:start position:0%
the uh
the

00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:42:56.550 --> 00:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
area is overcrowded
 
00:42:58.470 --> 00:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
we have supplies
 
00:42:59.829 --> 00:42:59.839 align:start position:0%
and vehicles stored all over the
 
00:43:02.069 --> 00:43:02.079 align:start position:0%
building some of the photos
 
00:43:02.079 --> 00:43:02.870 align:start position:0%
building some of the photos
are

00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:04.720 align:start position:0%
we show recreational equipment that are
 
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
stored in boiler rooms we have
 
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
vehicles that are stored in maintenance
 
00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
uh maintenance bays
 
00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
and we we really need additional storage
 
00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:14.079 align:start position:0%
space in order to
 
00:43:14.079 --> 00:43:14.950 align:start position:0%
space in order to
a

00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:14.960 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
be prepared for the next pandemic when
 
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
it does come um so we can have a not
 
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
stockpile but a little bit of surplus
 
00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
supply in ppe
 
00:43:25.349 --> 00:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
as needed um but even that aside we uh
 
00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
our our warehouse is cramped so with
 
00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
that i'll open it up to any questions
 
00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
you might have
 
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:33.109 align:start position:0%
thank you
uh

00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
my question relates to the sprinkler
 
00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
system and just want to be sure that
 
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
you weren't in violation of any local or
 
00:43:43.829 --> 00:43:43.839 align:start position:0%
or state regulations this is the the the
 
00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
mandate to have the sprinklers in the
 
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
closet is strictly a va
 
00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:48.950 align:start position:0%
closet is strictly a va
mandate

00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
so the answer is yes and no
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
so the the yes answer is we were we were
 
00:43:56.069 --> 00:43:56.079 align:start position:0%
in violation because the code does in
 
00:43:58.390 --> 00:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
fact say that sprinkler systems at
 
00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:00.640 align:start position:0%
nursing homes require our closets in
 
00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
nursing homes require sprinkler systems
 
00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
our v our
 
00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
fire marshal having local jurisdiction
 
00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
interpreted us as a medical facility to
 
00:44:11.589 --> 00:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
be exempt from that under what's known
 
00:44:13.589 --> 00:44:13.599 align:start position:0%
as a small room requirement the va
 
00:44:15.109 --> 00:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
disagreed with that
 
00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
so we are not in
 
00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
danger of being shut down because the va
 
00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
has no jurisdiction over that but they
 
00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
they have the power of the person they
 
00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
can withhold pretty in payments okay sec
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
follow-up to that is did the va give you
 
00:44:29.829 --> 00:44:29.839 align:start position:0%
a time frame on when you had to have
 
00:44:29.839 --> 00:44:30.790 align:start position:0%
a time frame on when you had to have
this

00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
in before they cut off the funding so
 
00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
they come every april to uh do their
 
00:44:38.069 --> 00:44:38.079 align:start position:0%
survey their annual survey we have a
 
00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
provisional certification into the next
 
00:44:43.589 --> 00:44:43.599 align:start position:0%
survey which is april
 
00:44:46.309 --> 00:44:46.319 align:start position:0%
we wrote in our corrective action plan
 
00:44:47.829 --> 00:44:47.839 align:start position:0%
that we would not be able to get this
 
00:44:50.109 --> 00:44:50.119 align:start position:0%
done until the fall of
 
00:44:50.119 --> 00:44:51.670 align:start position:0%
done until the fall of
2023

00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
2023
 
00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
knowing that we would have to wait for
 
00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
the process to go through
 
00:44:57.349 --> 00:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
so what they've done is given us a
 
00:45:00.069 --> 00:45:00.079 align:start position:0%
provisional certification they will come
 
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
in april they will find us again that
 
00:45:05.829 --> 00:45:05.839 align:start position:0%
will be a deficiency we will then again
 
00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh be on the record for and we'll have
 
00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:12.160 align:start position:0%
to show the progress as we go so if this
 
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
is approved we will show them that a
 
00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
progress and we'll do that all the way
 
00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
through we will get another deficiency
 
00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
in april because it would not be
 
00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
complete by april but there would be the
 
00:45:25.109 --> 00:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
expectation of it being completed by the
 
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
uh fall of 2023 or it would affect our
 
00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
okay well with the timing with this
 
00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
money and that it would be coming july
 
00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
1st 2024.
 
00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
how does that would that complicate the
 
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
issue or should we look for other
 
00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
good point
 
00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:48.390 align:start position:0%
good point
yes

00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
so i think that was an oversight i i um
 
00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
we'll have to work with the va to amend
 
00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:53.349 align:start position:0%
we'll have to work with the va to amend
our

00:45:53.349 --> 00:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry no i think i think we're
 
00:46:07.710 --> 00:46:07.720 align:start position:0%
correct so so
 
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
fy24 begins a year from now so i think
 
00:46:13.589 --> 00:46:13.599 align:start position:0%
no we're good we're i'm sorry um so we
 
00:46:15.349 --> 00:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
are hoping to get first on the priority
 
00:46:18.069 --> 00:46:18.079 align:start position:0%
and look at das uh so hopefully we can
 
00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
if we take the design out of hide we can
 
00:46:23.109 --> 00:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
begin to execute the project july 1 of
 
00:46:24.309 --> 00:46:24.319 align:start position:0%
next summer
 
00:46:26.829 --> 00:46:26.839 align:start position:0%
sorry i had to talk that through thank
 
00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
you it's always an issue with fiscal
 
00:46:31.349 --> 00:46:31.359 align:start position:0%
years right um
 
00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
you're like which one ends which year
 
00:46:35.589 --> 00:46:35.599 align:start position:0%
and which begins which year um
 
00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
so uh two things one is that uh first of
 
00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
all um commandant welcome to your first
 
00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
capital budget hearing um so you seem to
 
00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
be doing quite well though um and it's
 
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
not that shocking to me that um
 
00:46:49.109 --> 00:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
your excellent staff would have the
 
00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
title director of administrative
 
00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:51.750 align:start position:0%
title director of administrative
services

00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:46:54.069 --> 00:46:54.079 align:start position:0%
i suspect that makes the makes it just
 
00:46:56.950 --> 00:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
naturally a good stuff
 
00:46:59.109 --> 00:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
so anyway um building wide sprinkler
 
00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
system upgrade why not it strikes me as
 
00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
being a fairly urgent thing and and
 
00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
you're right capital budget you you know
 
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
a year from now you might get funding if
 
00:47:10.069 --> 00:47:10.079 align:start position:0%
everything goes it sounds like you
 
00:47:11.349 --> 00:47:11.359 align:start position:0%
probably will
 
00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
if i were a betting man um but
 
00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
um it feels to me like this is the kind
 
00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
of thing where
 
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
because of its
 
00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
quasi-urgent well it's urgent rather
 
00:47:25.589 --> 00:47:25.599 align:start position:0%
than emergency nature that maybe you
 
00:47:27.829 --> 00:47:27.839 align:start position:0%
could approach gopher about
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
about using arpa funds for and i'm sure
 
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
i don't want to speak for gopher or arpa
 
00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
funds but i think it's something where
 
00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
you you know you might be able to get
 
00:47:38.069 --> 00:47:38.079 align:start position:0%
started uh nine ten months earlier than
 
00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
you would otherwise
 
00:47:41.349 --> 00:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
so i'm just not sure
 
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
what the code would link to doesn't
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
there have to be a coveted link to
 
00:47:46.549 --> 00:47:46.559 align:start position:0%
gopher i'm not sure what that doesn't
 
00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
why don't we talk
 
00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
sounds good yeah and i think it's a
 
00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
thing because they're they're
 
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
god knows we're doing lots of things
 
00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
that don't have a
 
00:47:56.309 --> 00:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
uh i don't want to say this federally
 
00:47:58.950 --> 00:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
but there's not a direct covet link
 
00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:00.640 align:start position:0%
i think if we can have it resolved
 
00:48:02.309 --> 00:48:02.319 align:start position:0%
earlier the better because in april
 
00:48:04.309 --> 00:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
again that'll show as a deficiency for
 
00:48:06.549 --> 00:48:06.559 align:start position:0%
our facility and so it puts us at risk
 
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
every single deficiency puts us at risk
 
00:48:11.109 --> 00:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
for losing our per diem rate
 
00:48:12.069 --> 00:48:12.079 align:start position:0%
it feels like something we could
 
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
certainly pitch them on so thank you but
 
00:48:17.829 --> 00:48:17.839 align:start position:0%
that was the big thing so
 
00:48:19.349 --> 00:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to add one thing and
 
00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
you're right up um
 
00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that you could work on
 
00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:24.309 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that you could work on
design

00:48:24.309 --> 00:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
design
 
00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
sooner do you have funding available
 
00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
in the current biennium to help offset
 
00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
any of that i don't know how much the
 
00:48:32.549 --> 00:48:32.559 align:start position:0%
design cost would be but to help offset
 
00:48:42.069 --> 00:48:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
on the sprinkler system
 
00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
do you know how many closets
 
00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
you have offhand that need to be
 
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
sprinkled uh 300 building wide
 
00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:52.710 align:start position:0%
sprinkled uh 300 building wide
and

00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:54.790 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
and and does your estimate of
 
00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
is that for just adding
 
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
piping and sprinkler heads to the
 
00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
closets it's also involving incidental
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
work uh presumably we'd have to do some
 
00:49:15.109 --> 00:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
ceiling work hire a contractor in to cut
 
00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
holes in ceilings and things of that
 
00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:17.750 align:start position:0%
holes in ceilings and things of that
nature

00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
nature
 
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
but the estimate doesn't include any
 
00:49:24.309 --> 00:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
rework of the existing sprinkler system
 
00:49:24.319 --> 00:49:25.030 align:start position:0%
rework of the existing sprinkler system
no

00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:49:26.069 --> 00:49:26.079 align:start position:0%
would the
 
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
heads that are in the closets be fed off
 
00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
of the existing sprinkler system or
 
00:49:32.549 --> 00:49:32.559 align:start position:0%
would there be a new system just for the
 
00:49:32.559 --> 00:49:34.150 align:start position:0%
would there be a new system just for the
closets

00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
closets
 
00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
my instinct says it would be fed off the
 
00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
existing system but i would defer to a
 
00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
seeing it see no other questions thank
 
00:49:49.109 --> 00:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
you very much for your testimony thank
 
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to take about a
 
00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
12-minute break here and we'll be back
 
00:49:58.390 --> 00:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
at 10 o'clock with the department of
 
00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:21.829 align:start position:0%
at 10 o'clock with the department of
education

00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
but i knew peggy over the years so
 
00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:36.710 align:start position:0%
but i knew peggy over the years so
congratulations

00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:44.309 align:start position:0%
 
there's

00:50:44.309 --> 00:50:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:47.109 --> 00:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
so it came from a special formula that
 
00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
to be honest is a mess but putting that
 
00:50:50.549 --> 00:50:50.559 align:start position:0%
aside it took a year to figure that out
 
00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:52.559 align:start position:0%
but that so it says 1.2 there's a
 
00:50:52.559 --> 00:51:07.270 align:start position:0%
but that so it says 1.2 there's a
maximum

00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:07.990 align:start position:0%
 
but

00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
that's really more
 
00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
like all those things that were just
 
00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
generally you know what you're saying
 
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
about you know some other things that
 
00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:16.640 align:start position:0%
existed in revenue
 
00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
you would normally do these things right
 
00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:20.720 align:start position:0%
we haven't tapped into hardly any of it
 
00:51:33.109 --> 00:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
exactly that's exactly what it's for
 
00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
exactly yeah
 
00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
should we just reach out to the program
 
00:54:08.790 --> 00:54:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:22.870 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:22.880 --> 01:01:15.990 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:18.640 align:start position:0%
good morning commissioner
 
01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
good morning for the record frank
 
01:01:22.309 --> 01:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
edelblut commissioner of education
 
01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
tammy vallancourt cfo for the department
 
01:01:27.430 --> 01:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to begin by
 
01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
discussing our first two projects which
 
01:01:34.309 --> 01:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
in some sense are linked
 
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
and these are two projects that are
 
01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:38.480 align:start position:0%
really centered around
 
01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:39.510 align:start position:0%
really centered around
ending

01:01:39.510 --> 01:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
ending
 
01:01:41.430 --> 01:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
what i've referred to as the nomadic
 
01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
existence of the department of education
 
01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:45.839 align:start position:0%
and i can go into some of the details of
 
01:01:47.190 --> 01:01:47.200 align:start position:0%
that if that's important for the
 
01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
committee or is everybody familiar with
 
01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
how we were displaced a couple of times
 
01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
from our present facilities
 
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
yes yes okay
 
01:01:59.910 --> 01:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
and so the number one project is
 
01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
a project to acquire the granite state
 
01:02:03.910 --> 01:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
college building
 
01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
on hall street in concord that is the
 
01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
building that we are presently in and
 
01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
leasing from the university system of
 
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
uh we are occupying three of four
 
01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
flights or four floors in that building
 
01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
we are also leasing space
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
um in concord uh for our special
 
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
education um
 
01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
unit as well um if we were to acquire
 
01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
the building we would take over all of
 
01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
those floors and we would be able to
 
01:02:34.549 --> 01:02:34.559 align:start position:0%
consolidate all of our educational
 
01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
activities into that one building which
 
01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
would include the special education unit
 
01:02:41.349 --> 01:02:41.359 align:start position:0%
that we are in is in uh third-party
 
01:02:43.270 --> 01:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
lease facilities right now
 
01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
as well as our adult education and our
 
01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
career and technical education
 
01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
units that are presently in the walker
 
01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:50.630 align:start position:0%
units that are presently in the walker
building

01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
um and so this
 
01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh price that we've put on here
 
01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
obviously would be something that would
 
01:02:58.230 --> 01:02:58.240 align:start position:0%
have to be go out and get
 
01:02:59.910 --> 01:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
actual appraisals
 
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
but this is a an amount that we put in
 
01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
here that um was agreed to for purposes
 
01:03:07.829 --> 01:03:07.839 align:start position:0%
of the capital budget process by the
 
01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
university assisting and working with
 
01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
kathy provencher
 
01:03:12.309 --> 01:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
um so we feel pretty comfortable that
 
01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
you know it's not a it's not completely
 
01:03:16.230 --> 01:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
pie in the sky
 
01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
you'll see that the second
 
01:03:20.309 --> 01:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
item that it goes along with that is if
 
01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
we don't
 
01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
achieve item number one
 
01:03:25.270 --> 01:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
then there will be additional costs
 
01:03:28.069 --> 01:03:28.079 align:start position:0%
associated with allowing us to reoccupy
 
01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
the facility that we have we don't have
 
01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
a complete estimate as to what that
 
01:03:34.309 --> 01:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
would look like because
 
01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
the some of the asbestos remediation is
 
01:03:40.789 --> 01:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
ongoing and is even as we speak out for
 
01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh proposals to replace the ceilings
 
01:03:46.150 --> 01:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
that are in there
 
01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
but we've also got
 
01:03:50.950 --> 01:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
a previously approved capital project
 
01:03:53.190 --> 01:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
to replace the bathrooms which were in
 
01:03:55.510 --> 01:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
significant need of upgrade
 
01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
as well as some elevator work uh because
 
01:04:01.190 --> 01:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
the elevator is uh is antiquated and uh
 
01:04:02.950 --> 01:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
frequently breaks down and we end up
 
01:04:06.309 --> 01:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
with people stuck in there as well as um
 
01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
when there are heavy amounts of rain uh
 
01:04:10.549 --> 01:04:10.559 align:start position:0%
we generally end up with about a foot
 
01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
and a half of water in the bottom of the
 
01:04:15.109 --> 01:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
elevator shaft which make it difficult
 
01:04:17.109 --> 01:04:17.119 align:start position:0%
to to work with
 
01:04:19.109 --> 01:04:19.119 align:start position:0%
so these two projects
 
01:04:20.470 --> 01:04:20.480 align:start position:0%
go together
 
01:04:23.029 --> 01:04:23.039 align:start position:0%
in terms of trying to
 
01:04:23.039 --> 01:04:24.390 align:start position:0%
in terms of trying to
sustainably

01:04:24.390 --> 01:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
sustainably
 
01:04:26.710 --> 01:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
locate the department of education and
 
01:04:28.789 --> 01:04:28.799 align:start position:0%
avoid again the nomadic existence that
 
01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
we have going on right now and so i'll
 
01:04:32.549 --> 01:04:32.559 align:start position:0%
pause right now before i go to the next
 
01:04:32.559 --> 01:04:34.549 align:start position:0%
pause right now before i go to the next
project

01:04:34.549 --> 01:04:34.559 align:start position:0%
project
 
01:04:34.559 --> 01:04:36.630 align:start position:0%
project
okay

01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:36.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:04:39.029 --> 01:04:39.039 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
01:04:40.549 --> 01:04:40.559 align:start position:0%
who currently owns the building is
 
01:04:41.990 --> 01:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
university systems in new hampshire
 
01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
correct the current building is owned by
 
01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
the university system of new hampshire
 
01:04:48.549 --> 01:04:48.559 align:start position:0%
okay so if you transfer a payment from
 
01:04:50.230 --> 01:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
department of education to them it would
 
01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
be all in the family yes
 
01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:54.390 align:start position:0%
be all in the family yes
and

01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:56.549 --> 01:04:56.559 align:start position:0%
maybe this question is
 
01:04:59.829 --> 01:04:59.839 align:start position:0%
directed better to you but you the the
 
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
the building you had to vacate because
 
01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
of the asbestos problems what what
 
01:05:05.029 --> 01:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
what's happening or what has happened to
 
01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
that building so
 
01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
my past neighbor when i was at dra is
 
01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
that right okay so um at present the uh
 
01:05:14.549 --> 01:05:14.559 align:start position:0%
the flooring um asbestos has been
 
01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:18.640 align:start position:0%
mitigated um the ceiling asbestos was
 
01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh the asbestos has been taken out and
 
01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
now the ceilings have to be replaced in
 
01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:23.829 align:start position:0%
now the ceilings have to be replaced in
there

01:05:23.829 --> 01:05:23.839 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
when they were in the process of working
 
01:05:28.309 --> 01:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
towards that replacement
 
01:05:30.390 --> 01:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
they were had to look at the light
 
01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
fixtures and they noticed that the
 
01:05:35.270 --> 01:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
wiring is not decoded as well
 
01:05:36.789 --> 01:05:36.799 align:start position:0%
so then i think at present we're
 
01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
basically trying to figure out what is
 
01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
it going to cost to replace that wiring
 
01:05:41.829 --> 01:05:41.839 align:start position:0%
and then be able to put the ceilings
 
01:05:43.270 --> 01:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
back in
 
01:05:44.710 --> 01:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
and so that is
 
01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
what's happening there
 
01:05:49.270 --> 01:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
that would not include the renovation of
 
01:05:51.510 --> 01:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
the attic area that is referenced in
 
01:05:53.190 --> 01:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
this particular capital item which would
 
01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
allow us uh the room to be able to put
 
01:05:57.990 --> 01:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
everybody back in there uh albeit in a
 
01:05:59.750 --> 01:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
very inefficient kind of configuration
 
01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
but we could get ourselves back into
 
01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
that facility
 
01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
and then there would be ongoing projects
 
01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
we'd have another
 
01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
um i think it's about 600 580 000 of
 
01:06:13.190 --> 01:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
work in the bathrooms
 
01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
um as well as elevator work so i think
 
01:06:17.829 --> 01:06:17.839 align:start position:0%
what you find is as we begin to
 
01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
accumulate some of these costs um we're
 
01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
you know approaching in the several
 
01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
million dollars of of work to make the
 
01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
building occupiable not an efficient
 
01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:30.640 align:start position:0%
facility but occupiable um and so the
 
01:06:32.470 --> 01:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
question is is it better to just have
 
01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
the granite state building and then
 
01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
have a longer term plan for this
 
01:06:38.069 --> 01:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
particular facility
 
01:06:41.589 --> 01:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:41.599 --> 01:06:42.789 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:06:42.789 --> 01:06:42.799 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
are you wed on
 
01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
hall street um we're currently looking
 
01:06:50.950 --> 01:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
at a large building
 
01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
to lease in concord with the potential
 
01:06:59.029 --> 01:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:59.039 --> 01:07:01.510 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:07:01.510 --> 01:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:02.870 align:start position:0%
so
i

01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:08.309 --> 01:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure it
 
01:07:11.029 --> 01:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
would have room for them
 
01:07:11.039 --> 01:07:12.470 align:start position:0%
would have room for them
it

01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:07:14.789 --> 01:07:14.799 align:start position:0%
like if if we don't do anything else
 
01:07:17.029 --> 01:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
yes we could have room for them on on
 
01:07:18.309 --> 01:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
the other hand
 
01:07:20.710 --> 01:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
i think this is worth saying that
 
01:07:23.270 --> 01:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
so much of the state's infrastructure is
 
01:07:24.789 --> 01:07:24.799 align:start position:0%
you know i'm going to use london as an
 
01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
example and it and it really sounds like
 
01:07:29.349 --> 01:07:29.359 align:start position:0%
the commission is talking about a comedy
 
01:07:31.829 --> 01:07:31.839 align:start position:0%
of errors but it's not it's it's how
 
01:07:33.670 --> 01:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
these things work we you know we try to
 
01:07:35.109 --> 01:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
renovate buildings with people in them
 
01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
laundering happens to be one of the
 
01:07:38.470 --> 01:07:38.480 align:start position:0%
three or four worst buildings
 
01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:39.349 align:start position:0%
three or four worst buildings
um

01:07:39.349 --> 01:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
although probably not the worst building
 
01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:42.549 align:start position:0%
although probably not the worst building
but

01:07:42.549 --> 01:07:42.559 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:07:44.549 --> 01:07:44.559 align:start position:0%
we don't fix stuff because people are in
 
01:07:44.559 --> 01:07:45.510 align:start position:0%
we don't fix stuff because people are in
them

01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
and it's funny somebody said to me well
 
01:07:49.270 --> 01:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
now that it's empty
 
01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:50.150 align:start position:0%
now that it's empty
ish

01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
ish
 
01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:51.430 align:start position:0%
ish
um

01:07:51.430 --> 01:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:53.029 --> 01:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
i mean nobody's working there let's cut
 
01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
the whole thing and start over and i'm
 
01:07:56.390 --> 01:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
like that's a great idea we should do
 
01:07:59.270 --> 01:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
that um do you have any money
 
01:08:03.270 --> 01:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
and no neither do i okay and
 
01:08:05.029 --> 01:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
what you ought to do
 
01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
with all of the buildings on campus is
 
01:08:09.510 --> 01:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
you know in the in the early 90s they
 
01:08:11.349 --> 01:08:11.359 align:start position:0%
did was spalding they essentially went
 
01:08:12.789 --> 01:08:12.799 align:start position:0%
back to the brick
 
01:08:15.349 --> 01:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
and with dra i mean look at dra and i
 
01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:16.640 align:start position:0%
you know i can say this because lindsay
 
01:08:17.749 --> 01:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
isn't here but
 
01:08:19.189 --> 01:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
um it's the nicest building in state
 
01:08:21.349 --> 01:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
government and um
 
01:08:23.030 --> 01:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
and it you know it's unfortunate that
 
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
you know just just because you happen to
 
01:08:26.229 --> 01:08:26.239 align:start position:0%
work there you get to work in a gorgeous
 
01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
in a
 
01:08:29.910 --> 01:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
lovely building and you happen to work
 
01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
at the department of education you work
 
01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
in a dump
 
01:08:34.950 --> 01:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
and we need to get beyond that but
 
01:08:36.630 --> 01:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
you know those buildings are so many
 
01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
things in them and asbestos was you know
 
01:08:40.630 --> 01:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
the wonder drug of the year you know
 
01:08:43.749 --> 01:08:43.759 align:start position:0%
kind of like you know cocaine in 1910
 
01:08:45.349 --> 01:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:08:48.630 --> 01:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
and it's in everything and and you know
 
01:08:50.709 --> 01:08:50.719 align:start position:0%
uh you know we we run into problems
 
01:08:52.709 --> 01:08:52.719 align:start position:0%
because we fix things i mean the reason
 
01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
the asbestos came out is somebody fixed
 
01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:55.669 align:start position:0%
the asbestos came out is somebody fixed
something

01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:08:57.349 --> 01:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
um and it wasn't us by the way because
 
01:08:59.269 --> 01:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
we know where the asbestos is so we
 
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have done that my department
 
01:09:02.709 --> 01:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
but somebody fixed something they're
 
01:09:04.149 --> 01:09:04.159 align:start position:0%
like oh i didn't know that i didn't know
 
01:09:06.390 --> 01:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
you couldn't drill through the walls but
 
01:09:07.990 --> 01:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
you know i work in a building today
 
01:09:09.269 --> 01:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
where where
 
01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
sherry's office every wall says do not
 
01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:12.229 align:start position:0%
sherry's office every wall says do not
penetrate

01:09:12.229 --> 01:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
penetrate
 
01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:18.149 --> 01:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
so more specifically to your question
 
01:09:19.829 --> 01:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
we're not wed to that particular place
 
01:09:21.749 --> 01:09:21.759 align:start position:0%
but we're just led to an office building
 
01:09:23.110 --> 01:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
that's conducive to the work that we're
 
01:09:25.110 --> 01:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
trying to do
 
01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
but it's a good spot and would be a good
 
01:09:29.189 --> 01:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
deal and we're unlikely to find 50 000
 
01:09:31.669 --> 01:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
square feet of office space in concord
 
01:09:33.269 --> 01:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
in good shape
 
01:09:34.789 --> 01:09:34.799 align:start position:0%
at that price
 
01:09:37.189 --> 01:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
anytime in the near future i mean it is
 
01:09:38.709 --> 01:09:38.719 align:start position:0%
convenient because it is right off the
 
01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
highway we have about 7 000 um unique
 
01:09:43.269 --> 01:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
visitors every year that come to the
 
01:09:45.990 --> 01:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
department for various programming
 
01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
it is set up with um
 
01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
you know two classrooms and another kind
 
01:09:52.630 --> 01:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
of learning space that allow us to
 
01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
facilitate uh trainings many oftentimes
 
01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
that we hold for educators as well as
 
01:09:59.750 --> 01:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
allowing you know some of our educator
 
01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
associations to use some of those spaces
 
01:10:04.390 --> 01:10:04.400 align:start position:0%
we are able to host the state board of
 
01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
education meetings there um and so in
 
01:10:09.270 --> 01:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
that stan in that sense it has worked
 
01:10:14.950 --> 01:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:16.630 --> 01:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
something that doesn't always get
 
01:10:19.910 --> 01:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
considered is that nomadic existence is
 
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
expensive on the doit side as well
 
01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of opportunity cost went
 
01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
into moving frank and team around um
 
01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
during the last
 
01:10:30.790 --> 01:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
year or so
 
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
so the next
 
01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
projects that i want to present to you
 
01:10:42.229 --> 01:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
are two of our cte builds and you have a
 
01:10:42.239 --> 01:10:43.430 align:start position:0%
are two of our cte builds and you have a
handout

01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
handout
 
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
that kind of lays out where all of our
 
01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
cte centers are
 
01:10:49.189 --> 01:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
as well the renovation schedule so that
 
01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
you can see historically where we have
 
01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
done some of those renovations
 
01:10:56.229 --> 01:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
the present facilities that are up right
 
01:10:58.870 --> 01:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
now are the sugar river valley which is
 
01:11:01.350 --> 01:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
in newport as well as the winnisquam ag
 
01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
program in tilton
 
01:11:05.830 --> 01:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
sugar river valley is the first one for
 
01:11:08.950 --> 01:11:08.960 align:start position:0%
around a little over 11 million dollars
 
01:11:12.070 --> 01:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
that has already received the community
 
01:11:13.910 --> 01:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
support so they've already had a vote on
 
01:11:15.750 --> 01:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
it and so they are prepared and ready to
 
01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
move forward with that particular
 
01:11:19.590 --> 01:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
program how winnisquam is moving forward
 
01:11:21.270 --> 01:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
but has not yet been approved locally by
 
01:11:22.709 --> 01:11:22.719 align:start position:0%
their community
 
01:11:27.030 --> 01:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
but they will be working towards that
 
01:11:28.709 --> 01:11:28.719 align:start position:0%
uh commissioner
 
01:11:31.189 --> 01:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
is that this funding is at the 75
 
01:11:33.910 --> 01:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
percent i i realize the law says between
 
01:11:37.270 --> 01:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
50 and 75 but i'm assuming that this is
 
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
at the 75
 
01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
level i believe it is but let me turn
 
01:11:42.550 --> 01:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
around and confirm
 
01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:47.590 align:start position:0%
around and confirm
yes

01:11:47.590 --> 01:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:49.030 --> 01:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
which actually works out well to make
 
01:11:50.550 --> 01:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
sure that local communities have skin in
 
01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
the game in terms of making sure that
 
01:11:59.669 --> 01:11:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:59.679 --> 01:12:03.590 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:05.669 --> 01:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
and then our last project on our list is
 
01:12:06.950 --> 01:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
our pre-engineering three hundred
 
01:12:08.950 --> 01:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars which we use in our
 
01:12:10.709 --> 01:12:10.719 align:start position:0%
education programming for project lead
 
01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
the way uh is the principal deployment
 
01:12:14.709 --> 01:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
of that which is a
 
01:12:16.870 --> 01:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
stem-based engineering program that we
 
01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
use um in the schools and this acquires
 
01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
the equipment for those programs on an
 
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:33.510 --> 01:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:35.830 --> 01:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
can i ask a question about the cte um
 
01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
funding i um
 
01:12:40.149 --> 01:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
i like the renovation schedule chart i
 
01:12:42.709 --> 01:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
hadn't seen that before and it's um it's
 
01:12:44.149 --> 01:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
it's kind of neat because it explains
 
01:12:46.390 --> 01:12:46.400 align:start position:0%
the sort of vision of what's been going
 
01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:47.430 align:start position:0%
the sort of vision of what's been going
on

01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:48.870 align:start position:0%
on
um

01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:50.709 --> 01:12:50.719 align:start position:0%
it's a dumb question is there's nothing
 
01:12:53.030 --> 01:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
in 2223
 
01:12:55.030 --> 01:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
why did we skip that
 
01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
so as we approach the end of the list um
 
01:13:00.630 --> 01:13:00.640 align:start position:0%
really what we're focused on is
 
01:13:02.630 --> 01:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
communities that are ready to build
 
01:13:05.189 --> 01:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
right so the community itself has to
 
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh bring the project to us they might be
 
01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
in the queue and if somebody says we're
 
01:13:10.229 --> 01:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
not ready in the queue then we just
 
01:13:12.709 --> 01:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
accelerate the next person in that queue
 
01:13:14.630 --> 01:13:14.640 align:start position:0%
forward and so at that particular time
 
01:13:16.630 --> 01:13:16.640 align:start position:0%
there were not projects in there as well
 
01:13:18.070 --> 01:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
as i think for that period of time you
 
01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
had the
 
01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
hudson cte center that um if you recall
 
01:13:24.070 --> 01:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
this is one of those projects that we
 
01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:24.709 align:start position:0%
this is one of those projects that we
had

01:13:24.709 --> 01:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
had
 
01:13:26.709 --> 01:13:26.719 align:start position:0%
it spanned biennium we did part in one
 
01:13:28.709 --> 01:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
biennium and part in the second biennium
 
01:13:31.189 --> 01:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
um that's the will for wilbur h palmer
 
01:13:33.990 --> 01:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
center in hudson so it says 21 22 but in
 
01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
fact that a lot of that took place after
 
01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:36.630 align:start position:0%
fact that a lot of that took place after
that

01:13:36.630 --> 01:13:36.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:37.590 align:start position:0%
that
about

01:13:37.590 --> 01:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:13:40.070 --> 01:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
25 of the project rolled over into the
 
01:13:42.229 --> 01:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
the second year
 
01:13:43.750 --> 01:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
one of the things that's interesting is
 
01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
the way that this works is yeah you know
 
01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
you had the original build schedule like
 
01:13:49.990 --> 01:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
starting back in 1974
 
01:13:51.669 --> 01:13:51.679 align:start position:0%
and then the way that we have renovated
 
01:13:54.149 --> 01:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
these uh centers historically you know
 
01:13:56.149 --> 01:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
starting back in the 2003 time frame is
 
01:13:58.870 --> 01:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
really just got back in line
 
01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
we are approaching the end of this list
 
01:14:03.990 --> 01:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm not really sure that just uh you
 
01:14:06.070 --> 01:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
know the elapsement of time is the right
 
01:14:08.390 --> 01:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
sequencing for when to invest the next
 
01:14:10.229 --> 01:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
thing um really what we need to be
 
01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
looking at is a more
 
01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:12.870 align:start position:0%
looking at is a more
um

01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:15.430 --> 01:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
you know investment oriented approach uh
 
01:14:17.189 --> 01:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
that basically says we're investing in
 
01:14:18.630 --> 01:14:18.640 align:start position:0%
the kind of programming that our
 
01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
students need and so we would look at
 
01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
programming in the individual centers
 
01:14:24.709 --> 01:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
and invest in the programming that make
 
01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
sure that our students are trained in
 
01:14:27.510 --> 01:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
the skills that they need
 
01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
we do that when they come up in the
 
01:14:30.709 --> 01:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
queue like we're making sure we don't
 
01:14:32.950 --> 01:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
invest in programming you know that that
 
01:14:34.950 --> 01:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen anymore
 
01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
some examples of that is
 
01:14:38.149 --> 01:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
you know we're not interested in
 
01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
horticulture programs anymore uh we will
 
01:14:42.070 --> 01:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
do plant science some of these large
 
01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
greenhouse operations but it's a whole
 
01:14:45.990 --> 01:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
different type of pedagogy that's taking
 
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:46.950 align:start position:0%
different type of pedagogy that's taking
place

01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:14:49.030 --> 01:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
as an example marketing programs which
 
01:14:50.950 --> 01:14:50.960 align:start position:0%
generally in the past looked a lot like
 
01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
retail stores
 
01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
those are not programs that we tend to
 
01:14:57.030 --> 01:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
support because marketing today is big
 
01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
data and amazon and trying to modernize
 
01:15:01.350 --> 01:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
the education so that the students
 
01:15:02.950 --> 01:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
coming out have skills for the 21st
 
01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:04.870 align:start position:0%
coming out have skills for the 21st
century

01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
century
 
01:15:06.709 --> 01:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
it's a and so this chart here on the
 
01:15:08.310 --> 01:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
renovation schedule that's ever that's
 
01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
all the cte centers correct and um
 
01:15:14.390 --> 01:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
i i just want to say this because it's a
 
01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
you know historically there are a lot of
 
01:15:17.110 --> 01:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
people who go the government can't
 
01:15:19.669 --> 01:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
commit to a 24-year plan
 
01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
on anything
 
01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:15:25.590 --> 01:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
and be trusted right and
 
01:15:27.110 --> 01:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
we did
 
01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:28.390 align:start position:0%
we did
yes

01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:15:30.229 --> 01:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
and it's it's it's kind of a neat thing
 
01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:36.830 --> 01:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
any other
 
01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:38.550 align:start position:0%
any other
questions

01:15:38.550 --> 01:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:15:46.229 --> 01:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:46.239 --> 01:15:47.590 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:15:49.189 --> 01:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
next up i'd like to invite the lottery
 
01:15:49.199 --> 01:15:59.669 align:start position:0%
next up i'd like to invite the lottery
commission

01:15:59.669 --> 01:15:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:01.910 --> 01:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
good morning jim doris cfo for the new
 
01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire lottery commission good
 
01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:04.310 align:start position:0%
hampshire lottery commission good
morning

01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:08.470 align:start position:0%
morning
morning

01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:09.990 --> 01:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh so you'll forgive me we haven't done
 
01:16:11.669 --> 01:16:11.679 align:start position:0%
a capital plan before so i haven't done
 
01:16:15.189 --> 01:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
this so bear with me um
 
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
we have a project that comes in just
 
01:16:19.910 --> 01:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
under 800 000 it's made up of three main
 
01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:21.270 align:start position:0%
under 800 000 it's made up of three main
areas

01:16:21.270 --> 01:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
areas
 
01:16:24.709 --> 01:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
um first area being quite vital uh
 
01:16:27.510 --> 01:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
is a replacement of our generator system
 
01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
uh the lottery is uh
 
01:16:32.470 --> 01:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
excuse me we're dependent on generator
 
01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
in case of power outages or anything
 
01:16:36.709 --> 01:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
obviously to keep our systems going but
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
it's not just for in the case of running
 
01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:40.640 align:start position:0%
the local lottery it's also running the
 
01:16:42.950 --> 01:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
games included in muscle and tri-state
 
01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
games which are nationwide your
 
01:16:47.030 --> 01:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
powerball mega millions
 
01:16:49.189 --> 01:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
and if we're unable to run our processes
 
01:16:51.669 --> 01:16:51.679 align:start position:0%
at night that literally halts the whole
 
01:16:55.270 --> 01:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:57.910 --> 01:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
so with our generators over 30 years
 
01:16:59.590 --> 01:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:17:02.470 --> 01:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
it's not much smaller than this room
 
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
it's the parts are getting very
 
01:17:05.830 --> 01:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
difficult to get and replace because
 
01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
it's obsolete many cases
 
01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
second part of the project is
 
01:17:11.990 --> 01:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
a roof
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
we purchased our building a few years
 
01:17:16.470 --> 01:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
ago as i'm sure all of you know um we
 
01:17:17.830 --> 01:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
knew that there was going to be a roof
 
01:17:19.590 --> 01:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
issue at that time because engineering
 
01:17:22.229 --> 01:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
study was done in 2017
 
01:17:25.110 --> 01:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
um we are experiencing leak in in the
 
01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:25.990 align:start position:0%
um we are experiencing leak in in the
roof

01:17:25.990 --> 01:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
roof
 
01:17:27.590 --> 01:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
along with that would be replacement of
 
01:17:30.390 --> 01:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
the hvac units as they are also reaching
 
01:17:33.830 --> 01:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
that life life cycle
 
01:17:37.270 --> 01:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
and the last area would be the uh server
 
01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:38.390 align:start position:0%
and the last area would be the uh server
room

01:17:38.390 --> 01:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
room
 
01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
our server room right now has a
 
01:17:41.830 --> 01:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
sprinkler system in it
 
01:17:44.630 --> 01:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
water sprinkler system again if
 
01:17:46.950 --> 01:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
something does happen and the issue goes
 
01:17:48.790 --> 01:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
off and those sprinklers go off our
 
01:17:52.390 --> 01:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
servers are obviously going to be toast
 
01:17:54.310 --> 01:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
so the idea would be to reconfigure the
 
01:17:57.430 --> 01:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
server room to include
 
01:17:59.030 --> 01:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
non-water system i can't remember the
 
01:18:01.030 --> 01:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
name of it right now i apologize
 
01:18:03.590 --> 01:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
and to off also reconfigure in the same
 
01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
time some office space in that
 
01:18:07.990 --> 01:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
reconfiguration to add some more space
 
01:18:10.709 --> 01:18:10.719 align:start position:0%
we've added as you all know
 
01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
kino sports betting hhr now all these
 
01:18:15.669 --> 01:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
different gaming systems increasing our
 
01:18:17.430 --> 01:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
staff greatly
 
01:18:19.590 --> 01:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
um a lot of these things came on after
 
01:18:20.950 --> 01:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
we bought the building and we are
 
01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
running short on space we've all already
 
01:18:26.390 --> 01:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
rented an additional space over on
 
01:18:28.149 --> 01:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
off airport road
 
01:18:30.790 --> 01:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
and uh we will we've outgrown that space
 
01:18:33.430 --> 01:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
already it's to the maximum so we are
 
01:18:35.750 --> 01:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
going to be looking to just re not add
 
01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
on to the building at this point but
 
01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
just reconfigure to get some more
 
01:18:42.870 --> 01:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:45.669 --> 01:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
and that covers our three main areas
 
01:18:47.189 --> 01:18:47.199 align:start position:0%
okay a
 
01:18:49.590 --> 01:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
question for you is the
 
01:18:51.189 --> 01:18:51.199 align:start position:0%
how long does and i know it's an
 
01:18:54.870 --> 01:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
estimate does your generator have uh are
 
01:18:57.830 --> 01:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
is a generator good for another year
 
01:18:59.830 --> 01:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
i certainly hope so
 
01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
um you know it's one of those things um
 
01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:04.070 align:start position:0%
um you know it's one of those things um
they're

01:19:04.070 --> 01:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:19:06.870 --> 01:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
mickey mousing some repairs at times
 
01:19:09.030 --> 01:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
when they have to to be able to come in
 
01:19:10.950 --> 01:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
and do service on it
 
01:19:14.550 --> 01:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
like i said it is very old i you know
 
01:19:16.070 --> 01:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
it's so tough to say because things were
 
01:19:18.550 --> 01:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
built differently and it could last
 
01:19:19.990 --> 01:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
another 10 years
 
01:19:22.149 --> 01:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
because it was well built at the time
 
01:19:24.149 --> 01:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
but at the same time it could last
 
01:19:26.709 --> 01:19:26.719 align:start position:0%
another year which is hard to call
 
01:19:28.470 --> 01:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
what's the cost of the generator
 
01:19:30.630 --> 01:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
fortunately that didn't get broken out
 
01:19:32.950 --> 01:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
completely but i do have an electrical
 
01:19:36.870 --> 01:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
number of 113 000 for the entire project
 
01:19:38.630 --> 01:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
so i would assume the generator is
 
01:19:40.229 --> 01:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
probably coming in from eighteen to a
 
01:19:47.189 --> 01:19:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
just um
 
01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
you're doing quite well for your first
 
01:19:51.990 --> 01:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
capital budget um
 
01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:19:55.669 --> 01:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
how much space are you renting now
 
01:19:58.790 --> 01:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
it's about 1800 square feet 1800 square
 
01:20:00.790 --> 01:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
feet and but based on what's going on
 
01:20:02.709 --> 01:20:02.719 align:start position:0%
with and you guys are kind of booming in
 
01:20:04.870 --> 01:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
a nice way and for for those of us who
 
01:20:07.030 --> 01:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
spend the money that you raise we thank
 
01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:07.830 align:start position:0%
spend the money that you raise we thank
you

01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:09.830 align:start position:0%
you
um

01:20:09.830 --> 01:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
probably going to go up in the short
 
01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:12.629 align:start position:0%
probably going to go up in the short
term

01:20:12.629 --> 01:20:12.639 align:start position:0%
term
 
01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean 1800 is not enough you're
 
01:20:16.550 --> 01:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
gonna need five no we have 15 people in
 
01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
there now um and you take my word for it
 
01:20:22.550 --> 01:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
they are in 1800 square feet yes oh okay
 
01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
wow and along with a little kitchenette
 
01:20:25.910 --> 01:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:20:27.830 --> 01:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
nursery room and all those different
 
01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
things that are required in there so
 
01:20:30.950 --> 01:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
01:20:32.470 --> 01:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
very tight cubicles hopefully they're
 
01:20:34.070 --> 01:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
friendly to each other that's all that's
 
01:20:42.310 --> 01:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:44.149 --> 01:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
good representative
 
01:20:46.950 --> 01:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
oh thank you
 
01:20:49.430 --> 01:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
if you had been blessed with uh taking
 
01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
care of marijuana
 
01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh did you make any preliminary estimate
 
01:20:55.830 --> 01:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
it was going to take you uh
 
01:20:58.790 --> 01:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
facility-wise to handle that
 
01:21:04.310 --> 01:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:06.149 --> 01:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
lottery on the other l oh i thought you
 
01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
were gonna get it
 
01:21:09.990 --> 01:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:21:17.110 --> 01:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:18.550 --> 01:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
not seeing any other questions thank you
 
01:21:23.350 --> 01:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:24.709 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:21:24.709 --> 01:21:24.719 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
again we're going to take a 10 minute
 
01:21:30.229 --> 01:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
break and be back at 10 30 with military
 
01:30:59.910 --> 01:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:01.750 --> 01:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
i'd ask people to take their sisters
 
01:31:23.590 --> 01:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:25.910 --> 01:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
okay it's 10 30 and we have the military
 
01:31:27.910 --> 01:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
and veterans affairs
 
01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
sir the floor is yours thanks sir mr
 
01:31:32.390 --> 01:31:32.400 align:start position:0%
gary members of the committee um for the
 
01:31:34.390 --> 01:31:34.400 align:start position:0%
record i'm major general david mikulitis
 
01:31:35.350 --> 01:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
the adjunct general for the new
 
01:31:37.110 --> 01:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire national guard and for any
 
01:31:38.629 --> 01:31:38.639 align:start position:0%
technical questions i have here with me
 
01:31:40.870 --> 01:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
today major paige kamal
 
01:31:42.310 --> 01:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
she leads our construction facilities
 
01:31:44.229 --> 01:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
management office
 
01:31:45.430 --> 01:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
so you look at the military affairs and
 
01:31:46.870 --> 01:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
veteran services you should have two
 
01:31:48.790 --> 01:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
sheets hopefully first sheet should have
 
01:31:50.709 --> 01:31:50.719 align:start position:0%
six priorities that addresses our
 
01:31:53.350 --> 01:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
military affairs portfolio
 
01:31:55.030 --> 01:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
and when you go down our priorities i
 
01:31:56.830 --> 01:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
just like to focus on the top
 
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
five the first two we can sort of clump
 
01:32:02.629 --> 01:32:02.639 align:start position:0%
together a group together
 
01:32:04.950 --> 01:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
congress has appropriated us federal
 
01:32:06.950 --> 01:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
dollars in the president's future years
 
01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
defense plan for military construction
 
01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:10.390 align:start position:0%
defense plan for military construction
projects

01:32:10.390 --> 01:32:10.400 align:start position:0%
projects
 
01:32:12.070 --> 01:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
so you look at our top two priorities in
 
01:32:13.910 --> 01:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
nashua and plymouth
 
01:32:15.510 --> 01:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
those already congressionally
 
01:32:18.070 --> 01:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
appropriated federal dollars we're here
 
01:32:20.390 --> 01:32:20.400 align:start position:0%
seeking the state match in this capital
 
01:32:22.790 --> 01:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
budget um process
 
01:32:25.590 --> 01:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
to have the state match up for
 
01:32:28.470 --> 01:32:28.480 align:start position:0%
25 federal to state cost share
 
01:32:29.790 --> 01:32:29.800 align:start position:0%
the two top
 
01:32:31.910 --> 01:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
priorities for construction military
 
01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
construction a 5 000 square foot
 
01:32:36.470 --> 01:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
addition in nashua and about 25 to 30
 
01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
000 new armory uh the town of plymouth
 
01:32:43.430 --> 01:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
when you go down priority number three
 
01:32:45.270 --> 01:32:45.280 align:start position:0%
which is armory boil and roof
 
01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:47.270 align:start position:0%
which is armory boil and roof
replacement

01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
replacement
 
01:32:48.950 --> 01:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
each of our buildings has a different
 
01:32:50.870 --> 01:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
different federal state cost share you
 
01:32:52.550 --> 01:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
know some buildings are 100 fairly
 
01:32:56.229 --> 01:32:56.239 align:start position:0%
reimbursed some are 75 25 some are 50 50
 
01:32:58.550 --> 01:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
and some 100 state general funded it's
 
01:33:00.950 --> 01:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
all of a function of the sort of the
 
01:33:02.709 --> 01:33:02.719 align:start position:0%
purpose or the function that that unit
 
01:33:02.719 --> 01:33:03.510 align:start position:0%
purpose or the function that that unit
does

01:33:03.510 --> 01:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
does
 
01:33:05.510 --> 01:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
so for example our aviation facility and
 
01:33:07.030 --> 01:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
our maintenance facilities are 100
 
01:33:08.950 --> 01:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
federally reimbursed
 
01:33:11.110 --> 01:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
certain buildings in concord pembroke
 
01:33:13.669 --> 01:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
have a 75 25 federal
 
01:33:15.270 --> 01:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
state cost share
 
01:33:16.709 --> 01:33:16.719 align:start position:0%
this is just yet after routine
 
01:33:18.550 --> 01:33:18.560 align:start position:0%
maintenance for boiler boiler
 
01:33:20.870 --> 01:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
replacement and roof replacement and
 
01:33:23.189 --> 01:33:23.199 align:start position:0%
that's why it's a 75-25 cost share so we
 
01:33:24.629 --> 01:33:24.639 align:start position:0%
don't get the state general funds we
 
01:33:26.950 --> 01:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
cannot replace aging roofs on 30 year
 
01:33:31.510 --> 01:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
old 30 year old roofs on aging buildings
 
01:33:33.750 --> 01:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
priority number four is land purchase in
 
01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:35.189 align:start position:0%
priority number four is land purchase in
manchester

01:33:35.189 --> 01:33:35.199 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
01:33:36.870 --> 01:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
a strategic initiative priority for the
 
01:33:38.790 --> 01:33:38.800 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire is for us to
 
01:33:40.709 --> 01:33:40.719 align:start position:0%
relocate from our existing manchester
 
01:33:40.719 --> 01:33:41.910 align:start position:0%
relocate from our existing manchester
armory

01:33:41.910 --> 01:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
armory
 
01:33:43.990 --> 01:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
the manchester armory is approximately
 
01:33:46.470 --> 01:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
eight acres of land on north elm street
 
01:33:47.990 --> 01:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
it's a hundred thousand square foot
 
01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:49.110 align:start position:0%
it's a hundred thousand square foot
building

01:33:49.110 --> 01:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:33:50.709 --> 01:33:50.719 align:start position:0%
for the last decade or two i've been
 
01:33:52.390 --> 01:33:52.400 align:start position:0%
involved with different conversations of
 
01:33:54.149 --> 01:33:54.159 align:start position:0%
trying to relocate
 
01:33:55.830 --> 01:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
the manchester armory
 
01:33:57.750 --> 01:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
it all starts with land in the absence
 
01:34:00.149 --> 01:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
of land which is a state responsibility
 
01:34:02.149 --> 01:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
we cannot move the manchester armory or
 
01:34:04.629 --> 01:34:04.639 align:start position:0%
relocate to another location
 
01:34:06.390 --> 01:34:06.400 align:start position:0%
so based upon today's sort of a current
 
01:34:07.830 --> 01:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
01:34:10.070 --> 01:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
commercial climate for real estate um
 
01:34:11.990 --> 01:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
we're estimating approximately five
 
01:34:14.709 --> 01:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
million dollars to buy approximately 10
 
01:34:17.030 --> 01:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
to 15 acres of land
 
01:34:18.709 --> 01:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
when you go to your specific sheet
 
01:34:21.189 --> 01:34:21.199 align:start position:0%
there's a typo it says five acres it
 
01:34:23.590 --> 01:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
should say 15.
 
01:34:25.430 --> 01:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
priority number five is nashua hazardous
 
01:34:28.870 --> 01:34:28.880 align:start position:0%
material replacement uh remediation
 
01:34:30.870 --> 01:34:30.880 align:start position:0%
at our national armory where we're doing
 
01:34:33.350 --> 01:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
that 5 000 square foot addition we know
 
01:34:35.350 --> 01:34:35.360 align:start position:0%
for a fact that in the back of the motor
 
01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:36.149 align:start position:0%
for a fact that in the back of the motor
pool

01:34:36.149 --> 01:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
pool
 
01:34:38.790 --> 01:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
there's former tannery waste that's been
 
01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:39.750 align:start position:0%
there's former tannery waste that's been
capped

01:34:39.750 --> 01:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
capped
 
01:34:41.430 --> 01:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
so we have to take we have to sort of
 
01:34:43.669 --> 01:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
take a re-look at the sort of
 
01:34:47.510 --> 01:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
environmental uh issues at our national
 
01:34:49.669 --> 01:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
parcel to determine if it will have an
 
01:34:52.790 --> 01:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
impact on where we put this addition um
 
01:34:54.550 --> 01:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
in that future and if we do a future
 
01:34:56.709 --> 01:34:56.719 align:start position:0%
build out there
 
01:34:58.709 --> 01:34:58.719 align:start position:0%
so those are top five parties from the
 
01:35:00.950 --> 01:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
military affairs portfolio
 
01:35:02.390 --> 01:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
if you skip through skip through a
 
01:35:03.990 --> 01:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
couple of your pages you'll see another
 
01:35:05.910 --> 01:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
page called veteran services
 
01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
where there's two projects
 
01:35:10.550 --> 01:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
both 100 federally reimbursed
 
01:35:12.070 --> 01:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
and they both have to deal with the
 
01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
expansion the state veterans cemetery in
 
01:35:15.270 --> 01:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
bosco in
 
01:35:17.350 --> 01:35:17.360 align:start position:0%
one is for niches and ones for
 
01:35:19.830 --> 01:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
in-ground cremations
 
01:35:21.910 --> 01:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
and those are about two and a half and
 
01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
three and a half million dollars
 
01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:25.350 align:start position:0%
three and a half million dollars
respectively

01:35:25.350 --> 01:35:25.360 align:start position:0%
respectively
 
01:35:26.950 --> 01:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
subject to your questions that's all i
 
01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:29.669 align:start position:0%
subject to your questions that's all i
have

01:35:29.669 --> 01:35:29.679 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:35:31.590 --> 01:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:33.510 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
the

01:35:33.510 --> 01:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:35:35.270 --> 01:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
the armory in manchester if you could
 
01:35:37.030 --> 01:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
just briefly explain
 
01:35:39.270 --> 01:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
why you need a new facility and then
 
01:35:40.790 --> 01:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
what what are the plans to happen with
 
01:35:42.550 --> 01:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
the current facility that you have once
 
01:35:44.390 --> 01:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
this new
 
01:35:46.629 --> 01:35:46.639 align:start position:0%
project is is completed
 
01:35:48.709 --> 01:35:48.719 align:start position:0%
so right now
 
01:35:48.719 --> 01:35:50.070 align:start position:0%
so right now
the

01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:35:54.390 --> 01:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
the manchester armory sits on land owned
 
01:35:56.390 --> 01:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
by the ammo skate industries
 
01:35:59.510 --> 01:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
so when we vacate that land the building
 
01:36:01.030 --> 01:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
and the land goes to the ammo skate
 
01:36:03.189 --> 01:36:03.199 align:start position:0%
industries due to its revisionary claws
 
01:36:04.390 --> 01:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
because they give us the land back in
 
01:36:06.629 --> 01:36:06.639 align:start position:0%
the 1930s to build this armory
 
01:36:06.639 --> 01:36:07.590 align:start position:0%
the 1930s to build this armory
um

01:36:07.590 --> 01:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:09.990 --> 01:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
that's the first parcel
 
01:36:13.510 --> 01:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
the army is over 80 years old
 
01:36:14.790 --> 01:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
although it
 
01:36:17.189 --> 01:36:17.199 align:start position:0%
meets our current needs
 
01:36:20.870 --> 01:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
um it's not ideally situated for our
 
01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:22.149 align:start position:0%
um it's not ideally situated for our
future

01:36:22.149 --> 01:36:22.159 align:start position:0%
future
 
01:36:25.430 --> 01:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
mission set so currently the unit in
 
01:36:26.790 --> 01:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
there is called our field artillery
 
01:36:28.950 --> 01:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
brigade headquarters they're currently
 
01:36:30.629 --> 01:36:30.639 align:start position:0%
in the middle east they deploy every
 
01:36:32.070 --> 01:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
four to five years so it's their fourth
 
01:36:33.990 --> 01:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
deployment in 20 years
 
01:36:38.229 --> 01:36:38.239 align:start position:0%
and it's a technologically advanced um
 
01:36:41.430 --> 01:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
artillery unit that
 
01:36:43.510 --> 01:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
when they deploy overseas
 
01:36:45.350 --> 01:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
they don't have the internet sort of the
 
01:36:46.950 --> 01:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
the backbone
 
01:36:49.590 --> 01:36:49.600 align:start position:0%
to currently operate in that facility
 
01:36:51.510 --> 01:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
with some of the networks of which they
 
01:36:54.070 --> 01:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
have and we keep putting in a minor
 
01:36:56.470 --> 01:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
routine repairs to try to sort of uh
 
01:36:58.950 --> 01:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
bring it up to both code and to allow
 
01:37:01.030 --> 01:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
them to perform their federal mission
 
01:37:02.950 --> 01:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
but it's always been a challenge
 
01:37:05.669 --> 01:37:05.679 align:start position:0%
so if we can find more advantageous land
 
01:37:05.679 --> 01:37:06.790 align:start position:0%
so if we can find more advantageous land
um

01:37:06.790 --> 01:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:08.870 --> 01:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
we would the first step for us is buying
 
01:37:10.390 --> 01:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
the land and then sort of working with
 
01:37:11.990 --> 01:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
congress to get the appropriation for a
 
01:37:14.310 --> 01:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
military construction project
 
01:37:15.590 --> 01:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
you know the challenge has always been
 
01:37:18.470 --> 01:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
two-fold one is the cost to buy land
 
01:37:19.830 --> 01:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
we've worked with amaze skate industries
 
01:37:21.270 --> 01:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
in the city of manchester to look at
 
01:37:23.030 --> 01:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
land in the past and it's always been
 
01:37:24.870 --> 01:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
problematic um
 
01:37:27.189 --> 01:37:27.199 align:start position:0%
in a sense that it's either wetlands
 
01:37:29.990 --> 01:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
waterworks land um just not conducive
 
01:37:33.030 --> 01:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
for interstate access interstate access
 
01:37:35.189 --> 01:37:35.199 align:start position:0%
utilities and sort of visibility for the
 
01:37:37.030 --> 01:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
public to see us
 
01:37:39.030 --> 01:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
so that's always been the challenge for
 
01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:40.550 align:start position:0%
so that's always been the challenge for
us

01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:37:42.149 --> 01:37:42.159 align:start position:0%
does it have to be in manchester or
 
01:37:44.310 --> 01:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
what's what's the reasoning for the
 
01:37:46.629 --> 01:37:46.639 align:start position:0%
keeping it in manchester
 
01:37:49.030 --> 01:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
you generally speaking we would like to
 
01:37:51.669 --> 01:37:51.679 align:start position:0%
be within a 15-mile radius radius of
 
01:37:53.830 --> 01:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
manchester and i think the reason why is
 
01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:56.080 align:start position:0%
this simple covet
 
01:37:58.310 --> 01:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
right so you know everyone wants us to
 
01:38:00.229 --> 01:38:00.239 align:start position:0%
move into some other location or some
 
01:38:02.070 --> 01:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
other town well we just realized for the
 
01:38:03.590 --> 01:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
past two years of a cover response at
 
01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
those 17 armories that we had throughout
 
01:38:08.470 --> 01:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
the state we use them and so the the
 
01:38:10.229 --> 01:38:10.239 align:start position:0%
closer proximity that we have to the
 
01:38:12.070 --> 01:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
city of manchester to support them in a
 
01:38:13.910 --> 01:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
time of need i think is advantageous
 
01:38:15.510 --> 01:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
both to the guard and obviously to the
 
01:38:16.870 --> 01:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
city as well
 
01:38:20.070 --> 01:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
okay so it's mission compatible that
 
01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:21.350 align:start position:0%
okay so it's mission compatible that
yes

01:38:21.350 --> 01:38:21.360 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:38:26.470 --> 01:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:29.430 --> 01:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
i don't see any other questions
 
01:38:42.830 --> 01:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:45.910 --> 01:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
hey and again for those of you who just
 
01:38:47.830 --> 01:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
arrived uh
 
01:38:49.830 --> 01:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
the way this is scheduled we we can't
 
01:38:52.149 --> 01:38:52.159 align:start position:0%
call you before your scheduled time and
 
01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
so the next one is department of
 
01:38:57.030 --> 01:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
transportation at 10 45 so
 
01:38:59.830 --> 01:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
we will recess and for another eight
 
01:45:21.030 --> 01:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:22.870 --> 01:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
okay i think we're ready to begin
 
01:45:25.669 --> 01:45:25.679 align:start position:0%
uh department of transportation
 
01:45:27.750 --> 01:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
good morning commissioner
 
01:45:28.950 --> 01:45:28.960 align:start position:0%

01:45:33.990 --> 01:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
transportation's capital budget
 
01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:35.270 align:start position:0%
transportation's capital budget
priorities

01:45:35.270 --> 01:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
priorities
 
01:45:37.910 --> 01:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
with me today are marie mullen our

he'll be retiring next week and so all
 
01:45:56.390 --> 01:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
the difficult questions we're going to
 
01:45:58.229 --> 01:45:58.239 align:start position:0%
appeal to patrick today just to test him
 
01:46:01.830 --> 01:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:03.030 --> 01:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
and so again thank you for the
 
01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be here today um
 
01:46:07.750 --> 01:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
as many agencies have testified and we
 
01:46:09.590 --> 01:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
had several capital budget requests that
 
01:46:11.910 --> 01:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
we were contemplating putting forward
 
01:46:13.910 --> 01:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
and today we're really going to focus on
 
01:46:16.310 --> 01:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
our highest priority needs and we at the
 
01:46:18.310 --> 01:46:18.320 align:start position:0%
department of transportation are
 
01:46:20.629 --> 01:46:20.639 align:start position:0%
organized into five divisions
 
01:46:22.790 --> 01:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
finance administration
 
01:46:25.590 --> 01:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
project development operations and
 
01:46:27.270 --> 01:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
aeronautics rail and transit those are
 
01:46:29.350 --> 01:46:29.360 align:start position:0%
our five divisions and our capital
 
01:46:31.990 --> 01:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
budget requests are associated with two
 
01:46:35.430 --> 01:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
divisions uh the division of operations
 
01:46:36.950 --> 01:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
and then the division of aeronautics
 
01:46:39.189 --> 01:46:39.199 align:start position:0%
rail and transit and we are proud to
 
01:46:40.870 --> 01:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
partner with all of the transportation
 
01:46:43.430 --> 01:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
agencies in the state and so today we'll
 
01:46:45.109 --> 01:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
begin with our general fund request and
 
01:46:46.550 --> 01:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
then we'll talk about our highway fund
 
01:46:48.629 --> 01:46:48.639 align:start position:0%
requests and i'll just note on the
 
01:46:50.870 --> 01:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
general fund side um our two priority
 
01:46:52.709 --> 01:46:52.719 align:start position:0%
items are actually
 
01:46:55.430 --> 01:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
um to secure match to federal programs
 
01:46:57.910 --> 01:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
to support both our airports and our
 
01:46:59.990 --> 01:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
transit agencies that we work with and
 
01:47:01.270 --> 01:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
the only request that we're putting
 
01:47:03.109 --> 01:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
forward that would directly impact the
 
01:47:05.189 --> 01:47:05.199 align:start position:0%
department of transportation are highway
 
01:47:07.189 --> 01:47:07.199 align:start position:0%
funded requests that are associated with
 
01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
the division of operations
 
01:47:10.950 --> 01:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
and so with that alternative is related
 
01:47:13.030 --> 01:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
to the aeronautics program so these are
 
01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:14.070 align:start position:0%
to the aeronautics program so these are
faa

01:47:14.070 --> 01:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
faa
 
01:47:16.149 --> 01:47:16.159 align:start position:0%
federal faa funds and it's the airport
 
01:47:18.390 --> 01:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
improvement program uh the department's
 
01:47:21.030 --> 01:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
requesting 1.2 million which would
 
01:47:23.030 --> 01:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
leverage nearly 70 million dollars of
 
01:47:24.790 --> 01:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
federal funds
 
01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:25.590 align:start position:0%
federal funds
it's

01:47:25.590 --> 01:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:47:28.229 --> 01:47:28.239 align:start position:0%
anticipated that this request includes
 
01:47:33.350 --> 01:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
40 projects for 12 public use airports
 
01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
and it's also anticipated that there
 
01:47:36.870 --> 01:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
will be federal funding for airport
 
01:47:39.430 --> 01:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
infrastructure airport terminals and air
 
01:47:41.590 --> 01:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
traffic control tower projects
 
01:47:43.910 --> 01:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
funded by the bipartisan infrastructure
 
01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:44.629 align:start position:0%
funded by the bipartisan infrastructure
law

01:47:44.629 --> 01:47:44.639 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:47:47.109 --> 01:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
which require less of a match with a
 
01:47:49.510 --> 01:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
zero to five percent match the aip
 
01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:50.629 align:start position:0%
zero to five percent match the aip
program

01:47:50.629 --> 01:47:50.639 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:47:53.669 --> 01:47:53.679 align:start position:0%
generally provides 90 federal funds with
 
01:47:56.310 --> 01:47:56.320 align:start position:0%
5 percent state match and 5 match from
 
01:47:58.790 --> 01:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
the local airports
 
01:48:02.070 --> 01:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
so on page 3 of the of the presentation
 
01:48:03.910 --> 01:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
that we have here we have a brief
 
01:48:06.390 --> 01:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
listing of the typical types of projects
 
01:48:08.790 --> 01:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
that go through the aip program whether
 
01:48:12.070 --> 01:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
it's taxiway runway rehabilitation
 
01:48:14.550 --> 01:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
etc and then on page four
 
01:48:16.709 --> 01:48:16.719 align:start position:0%
we have a listing of the diff the
 
01:48:18.149 --> 01:48:18.159 align:start position:0%
airports from around the state the
 
01:48:20.229 --> 01:48:20.239 align:start position:0%
projected uh capital projects through
 
01:48:22.470 --> 01:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
the airport master plan that these
 
01:48:25.669 --> 01:48:25.679 align:start position:0%
airports will be qualifying for um with
 
01:48:27.430 --> 01:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
a listing of the federal funds and then
 
01:48:29.350 --> 01:48:29.360 align:start position:0%
the state match requirement for those
 
01:48:30.870 --> 01:48:30.880 align:start position:0%
for those airports
 
01:48:33.750 --> 01:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
and then going to page five we have some
 
01:48:35.830 --> 01:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
examples of some of the
 
01:48:38.390 --> 01:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
projects and pictures of the various
 
01:48:40.870 --> 01:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
terminals and some of the airports and
 
01:48:42.470 --> 01:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
the projects that will be undertaken
 
01:48:45.109 --> 01:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
with these funds
 
01:48:48.950 --> 01:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
our second request is for transit funds
 
01:48:50.229 --> 01:48:50.239 align:start position:0%
so these are federal transit
 
01:48:52.149 --> 01:48:52.159 align:start position:0%
administration federal funds and we're
 
01:48:54.709 --> 01:48:54.719 align:start position:0%
asking for 570 000
 
01:48:57.910 --> 01:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
for the transit bus replacement program
 
01:48:59.990 --> 01:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
which will leverage 6.3 million in
 
01:49:01.270 --> 01:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
federal funds
 
01:49:03.590 --> 01:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
this program provides matching funds for
 
01:49:06.550 --> 01:49:06.560 align:start position:0%
the acquisition of approximately 36
 
01:49:08.550 --> 01:49:08.560 align:start position:0%
vehicles for non-profit agencies that
 
01:49:10.790 --> 01:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
provide transportation for seniors and
 
01:49:13.030 --> 01:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
individuals with disabilities
 
01:49:15.669 --> 01:49:15.679 align:start position:0%
and also 18 bus shelters for local
 
01:49:18.550 --> 01:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
public transit systems
 
01:49:20.870 --> 01:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
public transportation provides access to
 
01:49:22.629 --> 01:49:22.639 align:start position:0%
jobs and critical services for new
 
01:49:24.070 --> 01:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire residents
 
01:49:26.470 --> 01:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
this program the federal program
 
01:49:26.480 --> 01:49:28.550 align:start position:0%
this program the federal program
requires

01:49:28.550 --> 01:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
requires
 
01:49:30.629 --> 01:49:30.639 align:start position:0%
the match to be what we have is we have
 
01:49:32.470 --> 01:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
about half of the match is provided by
 
01:49:34.470 --> 01:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
the state and half is provided by the
 
01:49:37.350 --> 01:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
local transit agency that
 
01:49:40.149 --> 01:49:40.159 align:start position:0%
match can be either 80 20 so 80 federal
 
01:49:42.870 --> 01:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
funds 20 match where ten percent comes
 
01:49:44.070 --> 01:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
from the state
 
01:49:46.310 --> 01:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
and ten percent from the local or we
 
01:49:47.750 --> 01:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
have a program that's eighty five
 
01:49:49.350 --> 01:49:49.360 align:start position:0%
percent federal where seven and a half
 
01:49:51.350 --> 01:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
percent comes from the state and seven
 
01:49:53.189 --> 01:49:53.199 align:start position:0%
and a half percent local
 
01:49:55.109 --> 01:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
and if you go to page ten
 
01:49:56.950 --> 01:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
in the presentation
 
01:49:59.270 --> 01:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
we have a listing there of the
 
01:50:00.550 --> 01:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
request for
 
01:50:03.189 --> 01:50:03.199 align:start position:0%
vehicles and bus shelters
 
01:50:05.109 --> 01:50:05.119 align:start position:0%
for the from the various agencies around
 
01:50:07.430 --> 01:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
the state with the required match for
 
01:50:11.669 --> 01:50:11.679 align:start position:0%
both the state and the locals
 
01:50:13.830 --> 01:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
on page 11 we start with some pictures
 
01:50:15.910 --> 01:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
and these are are typically these are
 
01:50:17.830 --> 01:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
many of the transit vehicles that will
 
01:50:19.830 --> 01:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
be replaced with some of the condition
 
01:50:21.830 --> 01:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
and and corrosion that has occurred on
 
01:50:24.390 --> 01:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
those so we provided some examples of
 
01:50:26.149 --> 01:50:26.159 align:start position:0%
the the vehicles that would be replaced
 
01:50:28.149 --> 01:50:28.159 align:start position:0%
with these federal funds with utilizing
 
01:50:30.149 --> 01:50:30.159 align:start position:0%
the state match
 
01:50:31.750 --> 01:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
and then i just open up for any
 
01:50:36.070 --> 01:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:38.470 --> 01:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
all right my question is on the
 
01:50:40.390 --> 01:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
purchasing of of buses what's what's the
 
01:50:41.910 --> 01:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
useful life
 
01:50:44.149 --> 01:50:44.159 align:start position:0%
these days of a of a bus say an electric
 
01:50:44.159 --> 01:50:46.550 align:start position:0%
these days of a of a bus say an electric
bus

01:50:46.550 --> 01:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:53.030 --> 01:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:56.470 --> 01:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:58.149 --> 01:50:58.159 align:start position:0%
um so yes as director hurley he was
 
01:51:01.189 --> 01:51:01.199 align:start position:0%
sharing um we have not uh
 
01:51:03.830 --> 01:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
used federal funds to acquire
 
01:51:05.750 --> 01:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
any electric buses yet we're in the
 
01:51:07.350 --> 01:51:07.360 align:start position:0%
process of supporting
 
01:51:09.030 --> 01:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
some of our transit agencies in
 
01:51:11.270 --> 01:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
acquiring electric fleet for the first
 
01:51:11.280 --> 01:51:12.149 align:start position:0%
acquiring electric fleet for the first
time

01:51:12.149 --> 01:51:12.159 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:51:12.159 --> 01:51:14.390 align:start position:0%
time
um

01:51:14.390 --> 01:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:16.310 --> 01:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
advanced transit uh we did an item
 
01:51:17.510 --> 01:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
actually just approved by governor and
 
01:51:19.589 --> 01:51:19.599 align:start position:0%
council an advanced transit will be the
 
01:51:22.629 --> 01:51:22.639 align:start position:0%
first uh agency to have a fully electric
 
01:51:22.639 --> 01:51:24.149 align:start position:0%
first uh agency to have a fully electric
bus

01:51:24.149 --> 01:51:24.159 align:start position:0%
bus
 
01:51:25.430 --> 01:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
the vehicles that we're replacing
 
01:51:27.750 --> 01:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
primarily are diesel
 
01:51:27.760 --> 01:51:29.270 align:start position:0%
primarily are diesel
vehicles

01:51:29.270 --> 01:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
01:51:31.669 --> 01:51:31.679 align:start position:0%
it really depends on the mileage but you
 
01:51:33.830 --> 01:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
know approximately fleet lasts about 10
 
01:51:35.990 --> 01:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
years before we replace it
 
01:51:38.229 --> 01:51:38.239 align:start position:0%
if a bus is heavily utilized and of
 
01:51:39.910 --> 01:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
course is problematic they'll seek to
 
01:51:41.510 --> 01:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
replace it early based on the mileage
 
01:51:43.430 --> 01:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
rather than the age better way to ask
 
01:51:45.589 --> 01:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
the question is is there any difference
 
01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
in longevity from an electric vehicle
 
01:51:51.109 --> 01:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
especially a bus to one that runs on
 
01:51:53.589 --> 01:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
diesel yeah again um there's not a lot
 
01:51:55.990 --> 01:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
of data yet because this is a newer
 
01:51:58.470 --> 01:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
industry however i will say that the
 
01:52:01.030 --> 01:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
operating expenses are significantly
 
01:52:03.030 --> 01:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
lower with an electric vehicle over a
 
01:52:03.040 --> 01:52:04.470 align:start position:0%
lower with an electric vehicle over a
traditional

01:52:04.470 --> 01:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
traditional
 
01:52:05.750 --> 01:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
diesel bus
 
01:52:07.350 --> 01:52:07.360 align:start position:0%
the reason being
 
01:52:09.669 --> 01:52:09.679 align:start position:0%
there's less components and parts that
 
01:52:11.669 --> 01:52:11.679 align:start position:0%
need to be serviced regularly
 
01:52:13.750 --> 01:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
and so that brings down the cost
 
01:52:15.990 --> 01:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
significantly however the initial
 
01:52:18.070 --> 01:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
purchase price is higher
 
01:52:20.550 --> 01:52:20.560 align:start position:0%
currently the electric buses
 
01:52:22.070 --> 01:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
are significantly more of an upfront
 
01:52:22.080 --> 01:52:23.510 align:start position:0%
are significantly more of an upfront
investment

01:52:23.510 --> 01:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
investment
 
01:52:26.070 --> 01:52:26.080 align:start position:0%
the studies have shown that
 
01:52:27.589 --> 01:52:27.599 align:start position:0%
the break-even point is around three and
 
01:52:29.350 --> 01:52:29.360 align:start position:0%
a half years right now when you look at
 
01:52:31.430 --> 01:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
the life cycle costs and the cheaper
 
01:52:33.189 --> 01:52:33.199 align:start position:0%
cost of operating an electric vehicle
 
01:52:35.030 --> 01:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
compared to a traditional
 
01:52:35.040 --> 01:52:36.870 align:start position:0%
compared to a traditional
diesel

01:52:36.870 --> 01:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
diesel
 
01:52:39.189 --> 01:52:39.199 align:start position:0%
transit fleet
 
01:52:42.070 --> 01:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:44.229 --> 01:52:44.239 align:start position:0%
representative um you're not bringing
 
01:52:48.070 --> 01:52:48.080 align:start position:0%
anything forward for state-owned rail
 
01:52:51.750 --> 01:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
um in our original agency uh request uh
 
01:52:54.470 --> 01:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
we did have a couple of items um
 
01:52:57.990 --> 01:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
we you know certainly if there's uh
 
01:53:01.189 --> 01:53:01.199 align:start position:0%
general fund surplus opportunities or
 
01:53:02.550 --> 01:53:02.560 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to put forward additional
 
01:53:02.560 --> 01:53:03.589 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to put forward additional
requests

01:53:03.589 --> 01:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
requests
 
01:53:04.790 --> 01:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
we would
 
01:53:07.030 --> 01:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
advocate for investment in our active
 
01:53:09.669 --> 01:53:09.679 align:start position:0%
rail lines first and foremost we have a
 
01:53:11.990 --> 01:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
number of culvert replacement projects
 
01:53:14.149 --> 01:53:14.159 align:start position:0%
bridge projects as well as thai projects
 
01:53:15.669 --> 01:53:15.679 align:start position:0%
that we would
 
01:53:17.750 --> 01:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
really like to move forward in the next
 
01:53:17.760 --> 01:53:18.870 align:start position:0%
really like to move forward in the next
biennium

01:53:18.870 --> 01:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
01:53:20.629 --> 01:53:20.639 align:start position:0%
but we'll have to wait and see what
 
01:53:22.550 --> 01:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
money might be available these
 
01:53:24.229 --> 01:53:24.239 align:start position:0%
two items that you have before you today
 
01:53:26.149 --> 01:53:26.159 align:start position:0%
really are the highest need because
 
01:53:27.589 --> 01:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
we're trying to access those federal
 
01:53:29.430 --> 01:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
funds and make sure that the state can
 
01:53:35.350 --> 01:53:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:37.990 --> 01:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
i have to ask about an airport question
 
01:53:41.030 --> 01:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
because i can't let patrick get away
 
01:53:43.430 --> 01:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
without us asking about airports
 
01:53:45.030 --> 01:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
i wasn't going to until you announced
 
01:53:46.950 --> 01:53:46.960 align:start position:0%
that he was retiring
 
01:53:46.960 --> 01:53:48.149 align:start position:0%
that he was retiring
um

01:53:48.149 --> 01:53:48.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:51.350 --> 01:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
so uh i actually i'm curious about
 
01:53:53.270 --> 01:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
airports and a lot of it is because i
 
01:53:55.589 --> 01:53:55.599 align:start position:0%
drive by the concord airport too often
 
01:53:58.629 --> 01:53:58.639 align:start position:0%
when i go i can go up to dop and i go
 
01:53:59.830 --> 01:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
right by the concrete airport and i
 
01:54:01.589 --> 01:54:01.599 align:start position:0%
always look at it and go you know that
 
01:54:04.070 --> 01:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
building has some some potential but all
 
01:54:05.750 --> 01:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
of it unrealized
 
01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:07.189 align:start position:0%
of it unrealized
um

01:54:07.189 --> 01:54:07.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:09.589 --> 01:54:09.599 align:start position:0%
we have i think i read from this we have
 
01:54:11.350 --> 01:54:11.360 align:start position:0%
eight federally funded airports and to
 
01:54:12.629 --> 01:54:12.639 align:start position:0%
what extent is that
 
01:54:13.669 --> 01:54:13.679 align:start position:0%
pardon me
 
01:54:15.430 --> 01:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
12. thank you
 
01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:17.350 align:start position:0%
12. thank you
um

01:54:17.350 --> 01:54:17.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:20.149 --> 01:54:20.159 align:start position:0%
many of those are municipally owned
 
01:54:22.629 --> 01:54:22.639 align:start position:0%
and to what extent how do we determine
 
01:54:24.149 --> 01:54:24.159 align:start position:0%
what's a state responsibility what's a
 
01:54:26.790 --> 01:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
town responsibility and
 
01:54:28.880 --> 01:54:28.890 align:start position:0%
and in addition to that um
 
01:54:28.890 --> 01:54:30.149 align:start position:0%
and in addition to that um
[Music]

01:54:30.149 --> 01:54:30.159 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:54:32.229 --> 01:54:32.239 align:start position:0%
do we think uh the health of the
 
01:54:33.830 --> 01:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
airports is
 
01:54:35.830 --> 01:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
i mean our airport's uh closing
 
01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:38.229 align:start position:0%
i mean our airport's uh closing
expanding

01:54:38.229 --> 01:54:38.239 align:start position:0%
expanding
 
01:54:42.390 --> 01:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:46.149 --> 01:54:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:48.229 --> 01:54:48.239 align:start position:0%
and thank you for uh asking director
 
01:54:50.310 --> 01:54:50.320 align:start position:0%
hurley that question see i this is what
 
01:54:51.750 --> 01:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
this is what i'm trying to do get him to
 
01:54:52.629 --> 01:54:52.639 align:start position:0%
come up
 
01:54:55.270 --> 01:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
but my answer expires in six days so
 
01:54:56.390 --> 01:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
that's okay
 
01:54:57.990 --> 01:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
um i'd say the
 
01:54:59.910 --> 01:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
most most of the airports that we're
 
01:55:01.350 --> 01:55:01.360 align:start position:0%
dealing with here in in this budget
 
01:55:03.270 --> 01:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
request are general aviation airports
 
01:55:05.350 --> 01:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
similar to concord
 
01:55:06.790 --> 01:55:06.800 align:start position:0%
they are all
 
01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:07.750 align:start position:0%
they are all
uh

01:55:07.750 --> 01:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:55:10.229 --> 01:55:10.239 align:start position:0%
still open to the public they exist they
 
01:55:12.229 --> 01:55:12.239 align:start position:0%
have planes based there so i would say
 
01:55:14.550 --> 01:55:14.560 align:start position:0%
that it's pretty much been status quo
 
01:55:17.510 --> 01:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
since around 2008.
 
01:55:19.750 --> 01:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
and uh what happened in 2008 somebody
 
01:55:21.750 --> 01:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
close with something
 
01:55:23.910 --> 01:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
okay did things close in 2008 they
 
01:55:26.149 --> 01:55:26.159 align:start position:0%
didn't close but a lot of a lot of uh
 
01:55:28.310 --> 01:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
planes left the area or
 
01:55:30.149 --> 01:55:30.159 align:start position:0%
especially like businesses that use that
 
01:55:32.870 --> 01:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
use corporate aviation uh kind of scaled
 
01:55:34.709 --> 01:55:34.719 align:start position:0%
back on that but now they've been coming
 
01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
back to that
 
01:55:38.950 --> 01:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
um so you know the planes have increased
 
01:55:40.629 --> 01:55:40.639 align:start position:0%
over the last few years but again it's
 
01:55:40.639 --> 01:55:41.350 align:start position:0%
over the last few years but again it's
been

01:55:41.350 --> 01:55:41.360 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:55:43.589 --> 01:55:43.599 align:start position:0%
a modest increase
 
01:55:43.599 --> 01:55:44.470 align:start position:0%
a modest increase
okay

01:55:44.470 --> 01:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:55:47.270 --> 01:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
and and it to some extent with some of
 
01:55:49.350 --> 01:55:49.360 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure improvements
 
01:55:50.870 --> 01:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
i mean would you anticipate that
 
01:55:52.629 --> 01:55:52.639 align:start position:0%
expanding i mean i doubt we're ever
 
01:55:54.390 --> 01:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
going to have another airport because
 
01:55:55.990 --> 01:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
you know the land issue and all that if
 
01:55:57.589 --> 01:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
nothing else but
 
01:55:57.599 --> 01:55:58.709 align:start position:0%
nothing else but
um

01:55:58.709 --> 01:55:58.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:01.189 --> 01:56:01.199 align:start position:0%
some could thrive
 
01:56:03.990 --> 01:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
i mean i you i look at it and say go go
 
01:56:05.430 --> 01:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
to nashua look at that airport that
 
01:56:07.189 --> 01:56:07.199 align:start position:0%
thrives that's a general aviation
 
01:56:09.270 --> 01:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
airport that thrives
 
01:56:11.750 --> 01:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
okay yeah that was my question yes nash
 
01:56:14.310 --> 01:56:14.320 align:start position:0%
was that way um skyhaven
 
01:56:16.390 --> 01:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
does does a good business down there
 
01:56:19.350 --> 01:56:19.360 align:start position:0%
concord does you go go on
 
01:56:22.550 --> 01:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
during uh graduations or during uh
 
01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:23.830 align:start position:0%
during uh graduations or during uh
um

01:56:23.830 --> 01:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:26.070 --> 01:56:26.080 align:start position:0%
when they have the nascar races
 
01:56:28.070 --> 01:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
and the airport's crucial at that point
 
01:56:29.109 --> 01:56:29.119 align:start position:0%
in time
 
01:56:31.350 --> 01:56:31.360 align:start position:0%
great um thank you for your answer and
 
01:56:32.550 --> 01:56:32.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for your service and
 
01:56:34.310 --> 01:56:34.320 align:start position:0%
congratulations on your retirement thank
 
01:56:36.149 --> 01:56:36.159 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
01:56:37.589 --> 01:56:37.599 align:start position:0%
since this is my first and last time to
 
01:56:39.589 --> 01:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
get to ask you a question yeah
 
01:56:39.599 --> 01:56:40.550 align:start position:0%
get to ask you a question yeah
um

01:56:40.550 --> 01:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:42.070 --> 01:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
the airline industry as a whole is
 
01:56:44.310 --> 01:56:44.320 align:start position:0%
undergoing some strenuous times right
 
01:56:47.510 --> 01:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
now i mean from inability to find pilots
 
01:56:49.589 --> 01:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
to fly their planes to
 
01:56:51.350 --> 01:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
fuel prices which are going through the
 
01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:52.629 align:start position:0%
fuel prices which are going through the
roof

01:56:52.629 --> 01:56:52.639 align:start position:0%
roof
 
01:56:55.990 --> 01:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
are are you anticipating any sort of
 
01:56:58.390 --> 01:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
contraction in the significant
 
01:57:00.229 --> 01:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
contraction in the airline industry and
 
01:57:01.350 --> 01:57:01.360 align:start position:0%
if so
 
01:57:03.830 --> 01:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
how will that impact uh may i guess
 
01:57:07.030 --> 01:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
mainly the airport in manchester right i
 
01:57:09.189 --> 01:57:09.199 align:start position:0%
i really don't have any information on
 
01:57:11.350 --> 01:57:11.360 align:start position:0%
that we're pretty much the construction
 
01:57:13.350 --> 01:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
group so we're the ones that go in and
 
01:57:15.510 --> 01:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
make sure that the airport is safe
 
01:57:17.350 --> 01:57:17.360 align:start position:0%
and that um you know things are being
 
01:57:20.229 --> 01:57:20.239 align:start position:0%
done to faa standards the market itself
 
01:57:22.229 --> 01:57:22.239 align:start position:0%
is more of an airport
 
01:57:25.350 --> 01:57:25.360 align:start position:0%
and a airline uh decision-making process
 
01:57:29.510 --> 01:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:31.510 --> 01:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
the one thing i would add is that you
 
01:57:31.520 --> 01:57:32.310 align:start position:0%
the one thing i would add is that you
know

01:57:32.310 --> 01:57:32.320 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:57:34.629 --> 01:57:34.639 align:start position:0%
while the average person thinks of
 
01:57:36.070 --> 01:57:36.080 align:start position:0%
commercial air travel when they think
 
01:57:37.910 --> 01:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
about airports
 
01:57:39.830 --> 01:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
our airports have a significant impact
 
01:57:41.750 --> 01:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
on our economy not just because they
 
01:57:43.750 --> 01:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
move people but because of the goods
 
01:57:43.760 --> 01:57:44.550 align:start position:0%
move people but because of the goods
that

01:57:44.550 --> 01:57:44.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:57:46.470 --> 01:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
are transported through the airports and
 
01:57:49.350 --> 01:57:49.360 align:start position:0%
so even when we've seen a contraction in
 
01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:50.950 align:start position:0%
so even when we've seen a contraction in
recreational

01:57:50.950 --> 01:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
recreational
 
01:57:52.550 --> 01:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
and vacation travel
 
01:57:54.310 --> 01:57:54.320 align:start position:0%
we've still seen especially during the
 
01:57:56.149 --> 01:57:56.159 align:start position:0%
pandemic the
 
01:57:58.390 --> 01:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
um critical role that our airports play
 
01:58:00.950 --> 01:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
in our overall transportation system and
 
01:58:02.629 --> 01:58:02.639 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of expansion when it
 
01:58:04.870 --> 01:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
comes to the commercial operations at
 
01:58:06.870 --> 01:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
these airs at these airports across the
 
01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:07.990 align:start position:0%
these airs at these airports across the
state

01:58:07.990 --> 01:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:58:09.669 --> 01:58:09.679 align:start position:0%
yeah manchester's in the process of
 
01:58:12.550 --> 01:58:12.560 align:start position:0%
going building a new cargo facility
 
01:58:14.629 --> 01:58:14.639 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
01:58:16.790 --> 01:58:16.800 align:start position:0%
good morning uh so my question is also
 
01:58:18.550 --> 01:58:18.560 align:start position:0%
on the aviation side but more on the
 
01:58:21.430 --> 01:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
funding in some of the summary pages it
 
01:58:23.109 --> 01:58:23.119 align:start position:0%
looked like the general fund share was
 
01:58:25.830 --> 01:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
around 7 million that was requested and
 
01:58:27.669 --> 01:58:27.679 align:start position:0%
63 million was going to be the federal
 
01:58:29.510 --> 01:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
match and i'm assuming it might
 
01:58:31.189 --> 01:58:31.199 align:start position:0%
might be a 10
 
01:58:32.550 --> 01:58:32.560 align:start position:0%
but it looks like in your description
 
01:58:34.629 --> 01:58:34.639 align:start position:0%
that based on the
 
01:58:36.310 --> 01:58:36.320 align:start position:0%
the average of like two and a half five
 
01:58:38.629 --> 01:58:38.639 align:start position:0%
or ten percent it's closer to 1.2 so i
 
01:58:40.470 --> 01:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
was just sort of trying to reconcile
 
01:58:43.510 --> 01:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
what the general funds share
 
01:58:45.750 --> 01:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
might be closer at
 
01:58:47.830 --> 01:58:47.840 align:start position:0%
there's a number of different federal
 
01:58:49.109 --> 01:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
programs that have different
 
01:58:51.750 --> 01:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
participation requirements and so the
 
01:58:55.669 --> 01:58:55.679 align:start position:0%
typical programs are 90 federal with a 5
 
01:58:57.830 --> 01:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
local match and 5
 
01:58:59.830 --> 01:58:59.840 align:start position:0%
state match
 
01:59:02.070 --> 01:59:02.080 align:start position:0%
however in the bipartisan infrastructure
 
01:59:04.709 --> 01:59:04.719 align:start position:0%
law there was some funding provided for
 
01:59:07.030 --> 01:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
airports and the matching requirements
 
01:59:08.950 --> 01:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
are different and so
 
01:59:11.510 --> 01:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
we have tried to anticipate based on the
 
01:59:13.830 --> 01:59:13.840 align:start position:0%
airport master plans what projects each
 
01:59:15.350 --> 01:59:15.360 align:start position:0%
airport will undertake
 
01:59:17.430 --> 01:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
and based on eligibility what the mix of
 
01:59:18.709 --> 01:59:18.719 align:start position:0%
funds will be
 
01:59:20.390 --> 01:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
and that's how we came up with the state
 
01:59:23.510 --> 01:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
match requirement the 1.2
 
01:59:24.470 --> 01:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:59:27.350 --> 01:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
so uh sherry if you assistant
 
01:59:31.189 --> 01:59:31.199 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner sherry um
 
01:59:33.189 --> 01:59:33.199 align:start position:0%
if you go to page four there's actually
 
01:59:35.430 --> 01:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
there's a detailed breakdown there so it
 
01:59:37.990 --> 01:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
in the upper box it shows that what the
 
01:59:39.830 --> 01:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner was just talking about with
 
01:59:41.669 --> 01:59:41.679 align:start position:0%
that 90 10
 
01:59:43.510 --> 01:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
share and so that we're showing this
 
01:59:45.430 --> 01:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
five percent state share so that comes
 
01:59:47.910 --> 01:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
out to about 2.7 million we're only
 
01:59:50.709 --> 01:59:50.719 align:start position:0%
asking for 1.2 and then that lower box
 
01:59:53.430 --> 01:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
identifies where that difference is so
 
01:59:55.669 --> 01:59:55.679 align:start position:0%
previously in previous bienniums we've
 
01:59:57.589 --> 01:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
requested matching funds and we've had
 
01:59:59.750 --> 01:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
we have some excess available so you can
 
02:00:02.310 --> 02:00:02.320 align:start position:0%
see there's about 1.5 million reduction
 
02:00:04.709 --> 02:00:04.719 align:start position:0%
in that below box so we're reducing our
 
02:00:07.109 --> 02:00:07.119 align:start position:0%
request down to the 1.2 million for what
 
02:00:09.109 --> 02:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
we we already have available from prior
 
02:00:10.629 --> 02:00:10.639 align:start position:0%
biennium approvals
 
02:00:12.070 --> 02:00:12.080 align:start position:0%
that's because
 
02:00:14.629 --> 02:00:14.639 align:start position:0%
2020 and 2021 with the code with relief
 
02:00:14.639 --> 02:00:15.589 align:start position:0%
2020 and 2021 with the code with relief
funding

02:00:15.589 --> 02:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
funding
 
02:00:17.990 --> 02:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
projects were allowed to use 100 federal
 
02:00:20.149 --> 02:00:20.159 align:start position:0%
funding we already had the state match
 
02:00:22.149 --> 02:00:22.159 align:start position:0%
authority but so we didn't use it so
 
02:00:27.270 --> 02:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:30.390 --> 02:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
and for the folks on online um
 
02:00:30.400 --> 02:00:31.430 align:start position:0%
and for the folks on online um
so

02:00:31.430 --> 02:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:00:33.669 --> 02:00:33.679 align:start position:0%
in previous bienniums we had requested
 
02:00:35.750 --> 02:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
the match but when the coveted relief
 
02:00:39.189 --> 02:00:39.199 align:start position:0%
funds came we um they provided 100
 
02:00:40.550 --> 02:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
of the federal funds and we didn't
 
02:00:43.189 --> 02:00:43.199 align:start position:0%
require state match so we have excess
 
02:00:44.629 --> 02:00:44.639 align:start position:0%
state match for the folks at home who
 
02:00:49.030 --> 02:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:49.040 --> 02:00:56.709 align:start position:0%
 
true

02:00:56.709 --> 02:00:56.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:58.709 --> 02:00:58.719 align:start position:0%
thank you okay um if no further
 
02:01:00.390 --> 02:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
questions we'll go on to the highway
 
02:01:02.470 --> 02:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
fund so our first request for the
 
02:01:04.070 --> 02:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
highway fund is for a little over two
 
02:01:06.390 --> 02:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
million dollars for construction of our
 
02:01:09.430 --> 02:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
salt and sand sheds
 
02:01:11.910 --> 02:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
currently in many of the locations we
 
02:01:14.950 --> 02:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
cannot store a season's worth of salt
 
02:01:16.790 --> 02:01:16.800 align:start position:0%
and the shred the sheds are reaching the
 
02:01:18.550 --> 02:01:18.560 align:start position:0%
end of their useful life and
 
02:01:20.629 --> 02:01:20.639 align:start position:0%
environmental regulations require that
 
02:01:23.430 --> 02:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
all salt be stored under cover
 
02:01:25.750 --> 02:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
so if you turn to page 14
 
02:01:28.070 --> 02:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
we have a listing of our oldest salt
 
02:01:29.430 --> 02:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
sheds and and those that we would
 
02:01:32.470 --> 02:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
anticipate uh replacing and so what we
 
02:01:34.470 --> 02:01:34.480 align:start position:0%
do is with this request we'll replace as
 
02:01:36.470 --> 02:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
many of these salt sheds as we can with
 
02:01:37.990 --> 02:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
the the funds
 
02:01:39.350 --> 02:01:39.360 align:start position:0%
that allow
 
02:01:41.270 --> 02:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
and so you can see
 
02:01:43.030 --> 02:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
many of these sheds here
 
02:01:43.040 --> 02:01:43.750 align:start position:0%
many of these sheds here
are

02:01:43.750 --> 02:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:01:46.070 --> 02:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
near 40 years old or some are over 40
 
02:01:47.350 --> 02:01:47.360 align:start position:0%
years old
 
02:01:48.950 --> 02:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
and some of the pictures starting on
 
02:01:51.350 --> 02:01:51.360 align:start position:0%
page 15. you can see the condition of
 
02:01:53.830 --> 02:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
these sheds the deterioration
 
02:01:57.669 --> 02:01:57.679 align:start position:0%
the holes in the in the siding
 
02:01:59.910 --> 02:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
and especially they were built so long
 
02:02:02.390 --> 02:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
ago that many of the the vehicles that
 
02:02:05.030 --> 02:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
we have can't fit inside of these sheds
 
02:02:08.390 --> 02:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
to move the salt efficiently so we're
 
02:02:10.070 --> 02:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
looking to replace some of these oldest
 
02:02:11.830 --> 02:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
sheds with with this funding and that is
 
02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:12.709 align:start position:0%
sheds with with this funding and that is
our

02:02:12.709 --> 02:02:12.719 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:02:14.629 --> 02:02:14.639 align:start position:0%
top priority request
 
02:02:17.669 --> 02:02:17.679 align:start position:0%
our second request
 
02:02:19.510 --> 02:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
is related to underground
 
02:02:21.350 --> 02:02:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh fuel tanks
 
02:02:23.910 --> 02:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
in the in the last biennium we were not
 
02:02:26.149 --> 02:02:26.159 align:start position:0%
approved generally we try to get money
 
02:02:28.550 --> 02:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
every biennium so that we can um
 
02:02:29.910 --> 02:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:02:32.470 --> 02:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
replace these tanks as needed during
 
02:02:34.629 --> 02:02:34.639 align:start position:0%
their replacement life cycle but in the
 
02:02:36.950 --> 02:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
last biennium we did not receive funds
 
02:02:38.390 --> 02:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
for this so we've had to defer tank
 
02:02:39.750 --> 02:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
replacements for the last couple of
 
02:02:39.760 --> 02:02:40.629 align:start position:0%
replacements for the last couple of
years

02:02:40.629 --> 02:02:40.639 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:02:42.709 --> 02:02:42.719 align:start position:0%
currently we have about 40 sites that
 
02:02:45.510 --> 02:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
have underground storage tanks that are
 
02:02:48.629 --> 02:02:48.639 align:start position:0%
in excess of 25 years old
 
02:02:51.510 --> 02:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
or nearing their life expectancy and so
 
02:02:52.709 --> 02:02:52.719 align:start position:0%
the perfect
 
02:02:54.950 --> 02:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
potential for environmental damage
 
02:02:56.950 --> 02:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
compliance and extensive repairs
 
02:02:59.589 --> 02:02:59.599 align:start position:0%
increases considerably as these
 
02:03:01.669 --> 02:03:01.679 align:start position:0%
underground storage tanks are aging
 
02:03:04.229 --> 02:03:04.239 align:start position:0%
we're requesting approximately 2 million
 
02:03:04.239 --> 02:03:05.510 align:start position:0%
we're requesting approximately 2 million
dollars

02:03:05.510 --> 02:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:03:06.870 --> 02:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
for that
 
02:03:09.189 --> 02:03:09.199 align:start position:0%
and if you go to page
 
02:03:11.350 --> 02:03:11.360 align:start position:0%
20 in the book
 
02:03:13.750 --> 02:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
we've listed some of our oldest fuel
 
02:03:16.550 --> 02:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
tanks and with this two million dollars
 
02:03:18.149 --> 02:03:18.159 align:start position:0%
we would reconstruct as many of these
 
02:03:19.669 --> 02:03:19.679 align:start position:0%
fuel tanks as would allow with those
 
02:03:22.310 --> 02:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
funds you can see that many of these are
 
02:03:24.310 --> 02:03:24.320 align:start position:0%
significantly beyond the the estimated
 
02:03:26.390 --> 02:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
useful life of the tanks at over you
 
02:03:29.030 --> 02:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
know 34 35 years old
 
02:03:30.629 --> 02:03:30.639 align:start position:0%
and that's what we would request these
 
02:03:33.030 --> 02:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
funds for
 
02:03:34.470 --> 02:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
our last uh
 
02:03:36.709 --> 02:03:36.719 align:start position:0%
priority request today is for five
 
02:03:39.030 --> 02:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
million dollars for the improvement of
 
02:03:40.390 --> 02:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
crew quarters
 
02:03:44.149 --> 02:03:44.159 align:start position:0%
at our patrol sheds statewide
 
02:03:46.550 --> 02:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
the improvements for these crest route
 
02:03:49.350 --> 02:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
uh crew rest areas are necessary um due
 
02:03:52.069 --> 02:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
to the winter activities the 24 7 nature
 
02:03:54.229 --> 02:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
during storms and the required safety
 
02:03:57.030 --> 02:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
breaks that are required we also need to
 
02:04:00.069 --> 02:04:00.079 align:start position:0%
comply with current building codes and
 
02:04:02.310 --> 02:04:02.320 align:start position:0%
safety fire marshal findings that we've
 
02:04:04.149 --> 02:04:04.159 align:start position:0%
had previously
 
02:04:05.830 --> 02:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
so the 5 million dollars would provide
 
02:04:08.069 --> 02:04:08.079 align:start position:0%
improvements to as many of the nearly 90
 
02:04:10.709 --> 02:04:10.719 align:start position:0%
dot patrol shed statewide
 
02:04:13.510 --> 02:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
and on page 24 of our presentation
 
02:04:16.069 --> 02:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
we've included some pictures there
 
02:04:18.149 --> 02:04:18.159 align:start position:0%
as to examples of the crew quarters that
 
02:04:19.910 --> 02:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
we currently have
 
02:04:22.069 --> 02:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
and you know some of the safety issues
 
02:04:24.149 --> 02:04:24.159 align:start position:0%
potentially the first picture on page 24
 
02:04:25.510 --> 02:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
you can see
 
02:04:27.830 --> 02:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
the crew quarters are right next to a
 
02:04:30.629 --> 02:04:30.639 align:start position:0%
budding the the heating system
 
02:04:32.950 --> 02:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
and probably not a
 
02:04:34.390 --> 02:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
good safety protocol to have our
 
02:04:35.990 --> 02:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
employees sleeping and resting in those
 
02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:37.189 align:start position:0%
employees sleeping and resting in those
areas

02:04:37.189 --> 02:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
areas
 
02:04:40.149 --> 02:04:40.159 align:start position:0%
during snowstorms so that that's our
 
02:04:42.069 --> 02:04:42.079 align:start position:0%
final request on the that we're
 
02:04:44.229 --> 02:04:44.239 align:start position:0%
presenting on the highway fund and
 
02:04:46.629 --> 02:04:46.639 align:start position:0%
opening up to any questions
 
02:04:49.109 --> 02:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
what's the age of the salt sheds now
 
02:04:51.830 --> 02:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
especially these pictures that you've
 
02:04:55.350 --> 02:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:57.589 --> 02:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
um on page 14 we have a list of the
 
02:04:59.990 --> 02:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
locations under item number three that
 
02:05:01.589 --> 02:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
we would intend to
 
02:05:03.830 --> 02:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
address with these funds
 
02:05:05.910 --> 02:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
and you'll see i see the okay i see the
 
02:05:08.950 --> 02:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
agency they rage in age from 19 to 44
 
02:05:08.960 --> 02:05:12.790 align:start position:0%
agency they rage in age from 19 to 44
years

02:05:12.790 --> 02:05:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:14.629 --> 02:05:14.639 align:start position:0%
and with some of these facilities it's
 
02:05:14.639 --> 02:05:15.510 align:start position:0%
and with some of these facilities it's
not

02:05:15.510 --> 02:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:05:18.550 --> 02:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
just the age of them but salt
 
02:05:20.950 --> 02:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
has obviously significant damage so when
 
02:05:22.790 --> 02:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
you have wooden structures and things so
 
02:05:25.270 --> 02:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
you know salt can deteriorate those very
 
02:05:29.030 --> 02:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
quickly as compared to a normal building
 
02:05:30.470 --> 02:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
the other challenge is you know we try
 
02:05:32.950 --> 02:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
to take advantage of
 
02:05:35.750 --> 02:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
competitive pricing and acquire a full
 
02:05:37.750 --> 02:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
year's worth of salt
 
02:05:39.510 --> 02:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
and sort of hedge against inflation when
 
02:05:41.669 --> 02:05:41.679 align:start position:0%
costs are increasing and currently we
 
02:05:43.910 --> 02:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
don't have sufficient space to store a
 
02:05:45.430 --> 02:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
full year's worth of salt some of our
 
02:05:47.510 --> 02:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
sheds are still on the smaller side so
 
02:05:49.830 --> 02:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
as we replace the older infrastructure
 
02:05:50.950 --> 02:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
we're making sure that we size it
 
02:05:53.189 --> 02:05:53.199 align:start position:0%
appropriately so that we can
 
02:05:54.790 --> 02:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
not only have efficient operations as
 
02:05:56.550 --> 02:05:56.560 align:start position:0%
marie was saying with more space to let
 
02:05:58.629 --> 02:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
the equipment operate within the shed
 
02:06:00.069 --> 02:06:00.079 align:start position:0%
but then also to make sure that we have
 
02:06:01.510 --> 02:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
the capacity to store the material that
 
02:06:02.470 --> 02:06:02.480 align:start position:0%
we need
 
02:06:04.629 --> 02:06:04.639 align:start position:0%
how many sheds do you have statewide
 
02:06:06.550 --> 02:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
um there's around
 
02:06:06.560 --> 02:06:07.430 align:start position:0%
um there's around
um

02:06:07.430 --> 02:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:09.510 --> 02:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
90 locations
 
02:06:09.520 --> 02:06:10.709 align:start position:0%
90 locations
okay

02:06:10.709 --> 02:06:10.719 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:06:12.790 --> 02:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
and so i take it you you build them
 
02:06:14.310 --> 02:06:14.320 align:start position:0%
periodically and
 
02:06:16.069 --> 02:06:16.079 align:start position:0%
yeah this is a recurring capital budget
 
02:06:19.030 --> 02:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
request um each biennium we're asking
 
02:06:21.270 --> 02:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
for the funds to replace a certain
 
02:06:23.109 --> 02:06:23.119 align:start position:0%
numbers so we can gradually address all
 
02:06:29.109 --> 02:06:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:32.069 --> 02:06:32.079 align:start position:0%
um of the 40 sites that have fuel tanks
 
02:06:34.310 --> 02:06:34.320 align:start position:0%
um how many tanks are
 
02:06:36.550 --> 02:06:36.560 align:start position:0%
does that comprise is it is it more than
 
02:06:38.550 --> 02:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
just 40 tanks
 
02:06:40.470 --> 02:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
yeah some of the tanks are combined
 
02:06:42.629 --> 02:06:42.639 align:start position:0%
sites for both diesel and unleaded so
 
02:06:45.270 --> 02:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
there's numerous tanks at each location
 
02:06:46.550 --> 02:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
and are there any
 
02:06:49.990 --> 02:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
you know building fuel tanks uh on those
 
02:06:52.709 --> 02:06:52.719 align:start position:0%
sites that need to be replaced as well
 
02:06:55.109 --> 02:06:55.119 align:start position:0%
i don't believe this item addresses any
 
02:06:57.430 --> 02:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
fuel tanks specifically for
 
02:06:59.109 --> 02:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
the gas
 
02:06:59.119 --> 02:07:00.470 align:start position:0%
the gas
storage

02:07:00.470 --> 02:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
storage
 
02:07:00.480 --> 02:07:01.510 align:start position:0%
storage
but

02:07:01.510 --> 02:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:07:03.350 --> 02:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
we certainly have other needs when it
 
02:07:05.030 --> 02:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
comes to replacing
 
02:07:07.510 --> 02:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
the tanks associated with our facilities
 
02:07:07.520 --> 02:07:08.790 align:start position:0%
the tanks associated with our facilities
themselves

02:07:08.790 --> 02:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
02:07:13.109 --> 02:07:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:14.470 --> 02:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
how many hi
 
02:07:17.750 --> 02:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
um how many um
 
02:07:19.430 --> 02:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
it says you have 40 fuel sites that have
 
02:07:21.669 --> 02:07:21.679 align:start position:0%
underground storage tanks uh
 
02:07:23.430 --> 02:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
silly question but do you have any that
 
02:07:25.669 --> 02:07:25.679 align:start position:0%
don't the weather tank isn't underground
 
02:07:28.550 --> 02:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
is is 40 the is the fuel distribution
 
02:07:28.560 --> 02:07:30.310 align:start position:0%
is is 40 the is the fuel distribution
network

02:07:30.310 --> 02:07:30.320 align:start position:0%
network
 
02:07:31.669 --> 02:07:31.679 align:start position:0%
40 sites
 
02:07:34.870 --> 02:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
no we have 40 sites that are 25 years um
 
02:07:38.069 --> 02:07:38.079 align:start position:0%
of age or older and so uh the request is
 
02:07:39.990 --> 02:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
associated with addressing those
 
02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:41.109 align:start position:0%
associated with addressing those
locations

02:07:41.109 --> 02:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
locations
 
02:07:43.189 --> 02:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
again this is a recurring capital budget
 
02:07:45.430 --> 02:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
term request because we try to each
 
02:07:46.950 --> 02:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
biennium address a certain number of
 
02:07:49.270 --> 02:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
tanks i just want to reassure you that
 
02:07:50.629 --> 02:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
we are in compliance with all
 
02:07:52.310 --> 02:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
environmental standards but of course
 
02:07:54.229 --> 02:07:54.239 align:start position:0%
the risks and when you have older
 
02:07:56.790 --> 02:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
equipment increase significantly as
 
02:07:59.030 --> 02:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
marie shared we did not receive funding
 
02:08:00.950 --> 02:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
through the last capital budget for fuel
 
02:08:03.270 --> 02:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
sites and so that's why we really have
 
02:08:05.430 --> 02:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
this is a high priority need in this
 
02:08:07.510 --> 02:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
cycle because we don't want to go four
 
02:08:09.109 --> 02:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
years without addressing some of these
 
02:08:09.119 --> 02:08:10.629 align:start position:0%
years without addressing some of these
locations

02:08:10.629 --> 02:08:10.639 align:start position:0%
locations
 
02:08:12.629 --> 02:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
so you have 40 sites that are over 25
 
02:08:15.189 --> 02:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
years old how many sites total
 
02:08:15.199 --> 02:08:18.229 align:start position:0%
years old how many sites total
ballpark

02:08:18.229 --> 02:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:20.390 --> 02:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
i think we have again around
 
02:08:24.069 --> 02:08:24.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:27.430 --> 02:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
not every shed has fuel however
 
02:08:27.440 --> 02:08:28.390 align:start position:0%
not every shed has fuel however
um

02:08:28.390 --> 02:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:29.510 --> 02:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
we have
 
02:08:31.030 --> 02:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
locations that are not at a shed for
 
02:08:32.550 --> 02:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
example here in concord there's one on
 
02:08:33.990 --> 02:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
hazen drive that's not one of our
 
02:08:35.830 --> 02:08:35.840 align:start position:0%
locations but they're generally
 
02:08:37.830 --> 02:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
co-located with other i know this is
 
02:08:39.830 --> 02:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
off-subject they're generally co-located
 
02:08:42.550 --> 02:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
with other facilities yes um to aid with
 
02:08:44.390 --> 02:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
our operations it makes sense to have
 
02:08:46.470 --> 02:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
fuel sites um
 
02:08:47.990 --> 02:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
both you know where the trucks operate
 
02:08:50.310 --> 02:08:50.320 align:start position:0%
but then also the staff that are
 
02:08:52.310 --> 02:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
responsible for those facilities are
 
02:08:54.709 --> 02:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
there to provide day-to-day oversight of
 
02:08:57.270 --> 02:08:57.280 align:start position:0%
the fuel site
 
02:08:57.280 --> 02:08:59.990 align:start position:0%
the fuel site
thanks

02:08:59.990 --> 02:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:02.830 --> 02:09:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:05.669 --> 02:09:05.679 align:start position:0%
representative uh commissioner
 
02:09:09.109 --> 02:09:09.119 align:start position:0%
looking at another agency's request
 
02:09:09.119 --> 02:09:10.069 align:start position:0%
looking at another agency's request
uh

02:09:10.069 --> 02:09:10.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:09:10.079 --> 02:09:11.430 align:start position:0%
uh
have

02:09:11.430 --> 02:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:09:14.390 --> 02:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
do you talk with with safety about what
 
02:09:17.189 --> 02:09:17.199 align:start position:0%
they are proposing to use highway funds
 
02:09:20.629 --> 02:09:20.639 align:start position:0%
in the next capital budget
 
02:09:23.030 --> 02:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
so in the early phase of the budget
 
02:09:25.350 --> 02:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
process each agency develops their own
 
02:09:28.950 --> 02:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
list of needs i'm certainly as we
 
02:09:30.149 --> 02:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
move into
 
02:09:32.069 --> 02:09:32.079 align:start position:0%
the later phases will be collaborating
 
02:09:34.629 --> 02:09:34.639 align:start position:0%
with safety um you know one of the
 
02:09:36.069 --> 02:09:36.079 align:start position:0%
things that was done during the last
 
02:09:38.069 --> 02:09:38.079 align:start position:0%
budget was an assessment of you know how
 
02:09:39.750 --> 02:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
much borrowing could be sustained with
 
02:09:40.950 --> 02:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
the highway fund and its current
 
02:09:40.960 --> 02:09:42.149 align:start position:0%
the highway fund and its current
revenues

02:09:42.149 --> 02:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
02:09:44.390 --> 02:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
and um so that's the one thing to stress
 
02:09:45.750 --> 02:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
is you know while
 
02:09:47.750 --> 02:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
generally we've talked about a general
 
02:09:47.760 --> 02:09:48.950 align:start position:0%
generally we've talked about a general
fund

02:09:48.950 --> 02:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
fund
 
02:09:51.510 --> 02:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
capital budget around 125 million we'll
 
02:09:52.950 --> 02:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
have to collaborate with safety to
 
02:09:54.870 --> 02:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
understand what the appropriate amount
 
02:09:56.310 --> 02:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
of borrowing would be
 
02:09:57.669 --> 02:09:57.679 align:start position:0%
based on general fund revenue
 
02:09:57.679 --> 02:10:03.910 align:start position:0%

good morning yeah we before we begin i
 
02:17:19.750 --> 02:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to i've been waiting to do this
 
02:17:22.150 --> 02:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
for for two days and that is i dare
 
02:17:22.160 --> 02:17:23.349 align:start position:0%
for for two days and that is i dare
correct

02:17:23.349 --> 02:17:23.359 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:17:25.349 --> 02:17:25.359 align:start position:0%
uh the commissioner to my right here and
 
02:17:27.830 --> 02:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
that he said repeatedly that the dra is
 
02:17:29.669 --> 02:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
the nicest building in state government
 
02:17:31.830 --> 02:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
having worked at the dra it is a
 
02:17:33.509 --> 02:17:33.519 align:start position:0%
beautiful building
 
02:17:35.589 --> 02:17:35.599 align:start position:0%
it's number two on my list
 
02:17:36.950 --> 02:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
and i've talked to this boat before the
 
02:17:39.429 --> 02:17:39.439 align:start position:0%
supreme court is the nicest building in
 
02:17:41.750 --> 02:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
state government
 
02:17:45.830 --> 02:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:47.589 --> 02:17:47.599 align:start position:0%
and no one would know
 
02:17:49.349 --> 02:17:49.359 align:start position:0%
it's 50 years old
 
02:17:51.750 --> 02:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
except we have our historic designation
 
02:17:54.950 --> 02:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
plaque now so i'm justice hans marconi
 
02:17:56.870 --> 02:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
i'm here to support diane martin our
 
02:17:59.669 --> 02:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
executive director and she will take it
 
02:18:02.150 --> 02:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
away okay please begin thank you hi
 
02:18:03.429 --> 02:18:03.439 align:start position:0%
diane martin director of the
 
02:18:05.589 --> 02:18:05.599 align:start position:0%
administrative office of the courts i
 
02:18:07.589 --> 02:18:07.599 align:start position:0%
like to think that where we are located
 
02:18:09.669 --> 02:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
right now is also very nice at one
 
02:18:12.629 --> 02:18:12.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:15.190 --> 02:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
hi senator
 
02:18:17.509 --> 02:18:17.519 align:start position:0%
okay so we only have one
 
02:18:19.349 --> 02:18:19.359 align:start position:0%
capital budget request that for this
 
02:18:22.070 --> 02:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
biennium it is fairly straightforward it
 
02:18:24.230 --> 02:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
builds off of work that justice hans
 
02:18:27.589 --> 02:18:27.599 align:start position:0%
marconi started in the last biennium to
 
02:18:30.709 --> 02:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
digitize some of the old book collection
 
02:18:32.870 --> 02:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
that is housed in the
 
02:18:34.950 --> 02:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
basement of the supreme court right now
 
02:18:37.750 --> 02:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
without any real protection and
 
02:18:40.309 --> 02:18:40.319 align:start position:0%
sort of incl in conjunction with this we
 
02:18:42.389 --> 02:18:42.399 align:start position:0%
are also working on creating
 
02:18:44.709 --> 02:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
an archive room in the basement where
 
02:18:47.190 --> 02:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
some of these older uh records and books
 
02:18:49.910 --> 02:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
can be placed but the safest thing to do
 
02:18:52.469 --> 02:18:52.479 align:start position:0%
obviously is to digitize them and to
 
02:18:54.549 --> 02:18:54.559 align:start position:0%
make them available electronically to
 
02:18:56.790 --> 02:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
people so that they can access them
 
02:18:58.629 --> 02:18:58.639 align:start position:0%
without actually seeing
 
02:19:00.950 --> 02:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
or touching them so we can preserve them
 
02:19:02.309 --> 02:19:02.319 align:start position:0%
but i'm going to turn it over to justice
 
02:19:04.469 --> 02:19:04.479 align:start position:0%
hans marconi to really speak to the
 
02:19:07.429 --> 02:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
merits of the project
 
02:19:10.150 --> 02:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
you can imagine my surprise when i
 
02:19:12.070 --> 02:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
joined the court and was assigned to be
 
02:19:14.389 --> 02:19:14.399 align:start position:0%
the library judge so housed in the
 
02:19:16.950 --> 02:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
supreme court building is the king law
 
02:19:19.030 --> 02:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
library it is
 
02:19:21.110 --> 02:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
i'll call it administratively connected
 
02:19:23.030 --> 02:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
with the court it is the state's only
 
02:19:25.750 --> 02:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
public law library it is the library of
 
02:19:27.589 --> 02:19:27.599 align:start position:0%
record it is the only place that the
 
02:19:31.349 --> 02:19:31.359 align:start position:0%
public can go in and get legal resources
 
02:19:31.359 --> 02:19:32.150 align:start position:0%
public can go in and get legal resources
um

02:19:32.150 --> 02:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:34.150 --> 02:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
and it's housed in our building and our
 
02:19:36.469 --> 02:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
librarian works with other public
 
02:19:39.190 --> 02:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
libraries to make sure those resources
 
02:19:41.429 --> 02:19:41.439 align:start position:0%
are accessible throughout the state but
 
02:19:44.230 --> 02:19:44.240 align:start position:0%
the universities the federal court those
 
02:19:47.509 --> 02:19:47.519 align:start position:0%
law libraries have over the years been
 
02:19:49.190 --> 02:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
i'll say privatized but there is no
 
02:19:52.469 --> 02:19:52.479 align:start position:0%
public access so in my
 
02:19:55.510 --> 02:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
job as library judge i discovered mary
 
02:19:57.270 --> 02:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
searle's our librarian of course knew
 
02:19:59.670 --> 02:19:59.680 align:start position:0%
they were there we have case books in
 
02:20:02.150 --> 02:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
the basement on shelves and i gave a
 
02:20:04.710 --> 02:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
presentation right before covid to the
 
02:20:08.790 --> 02:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
joint legislative historical committee
 
02:20:09.990 --> 02:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
on this
 
02:20:12.309 --> 02:20:12.319 align:start position:0%
fact that we have these old case books
 
02:20:14.630 --> 02:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
that range from 1849
 
02:20:16.389 --> 02:20:16.399 align:start position:0%
to 1970
 
02:20:16.399 --> 02:20:18.150 align:start position:0%
to 1970
1977

02:20:18.150 --> 02:20:18.160 align:start position:0%
1977
 
02:20:22.389 --> 02:20:22.399 align:start position:0%
not so old 1849 very old and beyond that
 
02:20:24.070 --> 02:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
we have some rare books and some
 
02:20:27.030 --> 02:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
documents um docket books that precede
 
02:20:27.040 --> 02:20:27.990 align:start position:0%
documents um docket books that precede
that

02:20:27.990 --> 02:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:20:29.590 --> 02:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
in these case books because what
 
02:20:31.750 --> 02:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
happened were the judges on the supreme
 
02:20:35.190 --> 02:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
court road circuit and they heard cases
 
02:20:37.349 --> 02:20:37.359 align:start position:0%
and then at the end of the case all the
 
02:20:39.110 --> 02:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
documents whether there was sheriff's
 
02:20:42.309 --> 02:20:42.319 align:start position:0%
notices deeds the court's notes the
 
02:20:44.230 --> 02:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
pleadings of the parties were put
 
02:20:47.030 --> 02:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
together and then cases were stacked up
 
02:20:48.950 --> 02:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
and when it got to a critical mass they
 
02:20:50.950 --> 02:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
stitched them into books
 
02:20:54.870 --> 02:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
so in these books are archival documents
 
02:20:58.710 --> 02:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
old paper inc charles doe writings um
 
02:21:01.910 --> 02:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
the mary baker eddie cases the original
 
02:21:05.110 --> 02:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
mary baker eddy trust cases which
 
02:21:07.110 --> 02:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
in recent decades
 
02:21:09.030 --> 02:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
because the litigation's been ongoing
 
02:21:11.670 --> 02:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
for so long or it starts anew people do
 
02:21:14.950 --> 02:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
come to research those old materials we
 
02:21:18.790 --> 02:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
also have the hairy hand case which is a
 
02:21:21.510 --> 02:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
law school favorite it is well known it
 
02:21:23.990 --> 02:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
is a well-known tort case involving
 
02:21:26.389 --> 02:21:26.399 align:start position:0%
medical malpractice where a doctor
 
02:21:30.389 --> 02:21:30.399 align:start position:0%
grafted skin that grew hair onto a palm
 
02:21:33.590 --> 02:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
injury and so the gent ended up with a
 
02:21:36.150 --> 02:21:36.160 align:start position:0%
hairy hand and sued
 
02:21:38.790 --> 02:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
so these are historical they're also
 
02:21:41.110 --> 02:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
valuable research documents
 
02:21:43.750 --> 02:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
this project in 2018 and you have in
 
02:21:46.550 --> 02:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
your materials the northeast document
 
02:21:49.830 --> 02:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
conservation center took a look at them
 
02:21:52.469 --> 02:21:52.479 align:start position:0%
put together a proposal two million
 
02:21:54.389 --> 02:21:54.399 align:start position:0%
dollars to digitize
 
02:21:57.750 --> 02:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
and preserve all those papers now
 
02:21:59.590 --> 02:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
obviously some of the
 
02:22:02.550 --> 02:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
my focus is the oldest and so they broke
 
02:22:05.270 --> 02:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
the project into three parts to deal
 
02:22:07.510 --> 02:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
with the oldest most fragile documents
 
02:22:10.950 --> 02:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
first and then as we go through time to
 
02:22:13.670 --> 02:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
preserve the later documents we will
 
02:22:16.870 --> 02:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
then have a gap between 77 and today
 
02:22:19.030 --> 02:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
when things have moved to a digital
 
02:22:21.750 --> 02:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
process but that's beyond
 
02:22:25.190 --> 02:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
my focus at the moment so what we did
 
02:22:27.910 --> 02:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
last year we had a small appropriation
 
02:22:30.870 --> 02:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars we have
 
02:22:33.830 --> 02:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
started on processing the first old case
 
02:22:35.750 --> 02:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
books so we'll have something to show
 
02:22:35.760 --> 02:22:36.389 align:start position:0%
books so we'll have something to show
you

02:22:36.389 --> 02:22:36.399 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:22:38.950 --> 02:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
shortly which they dis bind they take
 
02:22:40.950 --> 02:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
the documents they preserve them in acid
 
02:22:43.270 --> 02:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
free paper they go on shelves
 
02:22:44.870 --> 02:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
and then the
 
02:22:47.590 --> 02:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
the electronic version is available for
 
02:22:50.070 --> 02:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
research purposes and if someone needs
 
02:22:52.469 --> 02:22:52.479 align:start position:0%
to come in to get to the actual
 
02:22:55.910 --> 02:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
artifact we can produce that in a more
 
02:22:58.790 --> 02:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
rare book fashion so right now these
 
02:23:00.309 --> 02:23:00.319 align:start position:0%
things are on a shelf in the basement
 
02:23:02.230 --> 02:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
thank goodness we have a nice building
 
02:23:04.150 --> 02:23:04.160 align:start position:0%
it hasn't leaked
 
02:23:08.150 --> 02:23:08.160 align:start position:0%
but we really need to do something to
 
02:23:10.630 --> 02:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
better preserve these documents for the
 
02:23:11.910 --> 02:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
state because they aren't just court
 
02:23:14.790 --> 02:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
document their documents their state
 
02:23:17.349 --> 02:23:17.359 align:start position:0%
artifacts originally the library was
 
02:23:19.670 --> 02:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
intended to have a rare book room that
 
02:23:21.270 --> 02:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
never happened when the building was
 
02:23:21.280 --> 02:23:22.550 align:start position:0%
never happened when the building was
built

02:23:22.550 --> 02:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
built
 
02:23:25.349 --> 02:23:25.359 align:start position:0%
it's now a conference room so we have
 
02:23:27.910 --> 02:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
plans in the works not part of this
 
02:23:30.710 --> 02:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
project to identify space to have
 
02:23:32.710 --> 02:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
climate controlled so that when we get
 
02:23:34.550 --> 02:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
these documents preserved we have a
 
02:23:37.510 --> 02:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
place to store them long-term so this is
 
02:23:39.910 --> 02:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
just the um
 
02:23:43.429 --> 02:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
preservation digitization piece of it
 
02:23:45.349 --> 02:23:45.359 align:start position:0%
and so ultimately it will be a
 
02:23:48.630 --> 02:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
multi-year process and the final thing
 
02:23:51.990 --> 02:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
mary our librarian told me is with state
 
02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:53.030 align:start position:0%
mary our librarian told me is with state
funding

02:23:53.030 --> 02:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
funding
 
02:23:55.910 --> 02:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
she will have the ability to seek some
 
02:23:58.469 --> 02:23:58.479 align:start position:0%
additional funding from places like the
 
02:24:01.349 --> 02:24:01.359 align:start position:0%
library of congress and some federal
 
02:24:04.950 --> 02:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
grants that are geared toward
 
02:24:04.960 --> 02:24:06.070 align:start position:0%
grants that are geared toward
preserving

02:24:06.070 --> 02:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
preserving
 
02:24:08.070 --> 02:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
old documents so
 
02:24:10.469 --> 02:24:10.479 align:start position:0%
this is a start and it is
 
02:24:12.469 --> 02:24:12.479 align:start position:0%
frankly long overdue and i'm happy to
 
02:24:14.389 --> 02:24:14.399 align:start position:0%
take questions
 
02:24:16.070 --> 02:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
you said two million was the total
 
02:24:18.389 --> 02:24:18.399 align:start position:0%
figure to get all the
 
02:24:20.110 --> 02:24:20.120 align:start position:0%
all the uh
 
02:24:26.630 --> 02:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:31.110 --> 02:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:33.349 --> 02:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
um i just want to say first of all i
 
02:24:34.790 --> 02:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
want to thank the supreme court for
 
02:24:37.750 --> 02:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
sending my um favorite justice and i
 
02:24:39.750 --> 02:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
only i'm sorry the chief isn't here to
 
02:24:41.190 --> 02:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
hear me say that
 
02:24:42.790 --> 02:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
i'll be sure to tell him thank you i
 
02:24:44.790 --> 02:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
would appreciate that
 
02:24:46.070 --> 02:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
i would like that
 
02:24:46.080 --> 02:24:47.429 align:start position:0%
i would like that
um

02:24:47.429 --> 02:24:47.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:51.429 --> 02:24:51.439 align:start position:0%
i had the privilege of uh um
 
02:24:53.910 --> 02:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
working with justice marconi on a tour
 
02:24:57.190 --> 02:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
um of uh of she took me in the basement
 
02:24:58.710 --> 02:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
and showed me the books
 
02:25:01.030 --> 02:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
um and it was appalling right it was
 
02:25:02.870 --> 02:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
wonderful and appalling at the same time
 
02:25:04.550 --> 02:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
and i think this is a wonderful request
 
02:25:05.830 --> 02:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:25:05.840 --> 02:25:06.630 align:start position:0%
and um
um

02:25:06.630 --> 02:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:08.309 --> 02:25:08.319 align:start position:0%
i think there's a microwave in the same
 
02:25:10.150 --> 02:25:10.160 align:start position:0%
room right
 
02:25:13.030 --> 02:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
the books are on shelves outside of the
 
02:25:13.040 --> 02:25:14.150 align:start position:0%
the books are on shelves outside of the
shredding

02:25:14.150 --> 02:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
shredding
 
02:25:16.710 --> 02:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
closet so when it's important not to get
 
02:25:18.870 --> 02:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
confused just go down and get shredded
 
02:25:21.590 --> 02:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
the dust from the documents goes and i'm
 
02:25:21.600 --> 02:25:22.469 align:start position:0%
the dust from the documents goes and i'm
told

02:25:22.469 --> 02:25:22.479 align:start position:0%
told
 
02:25:24.790 --> 02:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
by northeast document center that that's
 
02:25:27.670 --> 02:25:27.680 align:start position:0%
a really bad thing so yes so i think it
 
02:25:29.190 --> 02:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
and i think it's great that we're gonna
 
02:25:31.110 --> 02:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
we're gonna um fix up space in the
 
02:25:33.110 --> 02:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
probably in the basement to to to have a
 
02:25:36.070 --> 02:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
room will some of this well some of the
 
02:25:36.080 --> 02:25:36.830 align:start position:0%
room will some of this well some of the
the

02:25:36.830 --> 02:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:25:39.510 --> 02:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
um most interesting documents eventually
 
02:25:41.830 --> 02:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
be on display somewhere that's what
 
02:25:41.840 --> 02:25:42.790 align:start position:0%
be on display somewhere that's what
we're

02:25:42.790 --> 02:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
we're
 
02:25:45.510 --> 02:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
so we have the rare book room
 
02:25:48.230 --> 02:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
we hope also to have a
 
02:25:51.110 --> 02:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
space for researchers to work with the
 
02:25:53.190 --> 02:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
materials but then we also want to have
 
02:25:56.309 --> 02:25:56.319 align:start position:0%
display space in the upper floors of the
 
02:25:58.710 --> 02:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
library so that the public we get
 
02:26:00.389 --> 02:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
student groups in we get the public in
 
02:26:02.630 --> 02:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
of course using the library and so a lot
 
02:26:05.270 --> 02:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
of these things we have a great place to
 
02:26:07.510 --> 02:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
showcase some of the important stuff
 
02:26:08.790 --> 02:26:08.800 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
02:26:08.800 --> 02:26:09.510 align:start position:0%
that we have
so

02:26:09.510 --> 02:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:26:09.520 --> 02:26:10.389 align:start position:0%
so
yes

02:26:10.389 --> 02:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:26:11.830 --> 02:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
good you were and you were telling me
 
02:26:13.830 --> 02:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
right before we um came on air so to
 
02:26:13.840 --> 02:26:15.190 align:start position:0%
right before we um came on air so to
speak

02:26:15.190 --> 02:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
speak
 
02:26:15.200 --> 02:26:16.469 align:start position:0%
speak
about

02:26:16.469 --> 02:26:16.479 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:26:18.469 --> 02:26:18.479 align:start position:0%
the notion of many of the court
 
02:26:20.710 --> 02:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
documents are sort of scattered about
 
02:26:23.270 --> 02:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh yes this is
 
02:26:26.469 --> 02:26:26.479 align:start position:0%
nicely these books are in one place but
 
02:26:28.870 --> 02:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
i have also learned through
 
02:26:30.710 --> 02:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
working with the supreme court society
 
02:26:32.710 --> 02:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
talking to the state archivist talking
 
02:26:35.990 --> 02:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
to clerks in our superior courts
 
02:26:38.309 --> 02:26:38.319 align:start position:0%
there are documents including case
 
02:26:40.230 --> 02:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
documents supreme court documents that
 
02:26:42.070 --> 02:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
are just
 
02:26:44.230 --> 02:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
scattered about and so
 
02:26:45.910 --> 02:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
big picture
 
02:26:48.230 --> 02:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
we'd love this is a start and we'd love
 
02:26:48.240 --> 02:26:49.110 align:start position:0%
we'd love this is a start and we'd love
to

02:26:49.110 --> 02:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:26:52.309 --> 02:26:52.319 align:start position:0%
um proceed with preserving this sort of
 
02:26:54.790 --> 02:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
legal history of the state and so the
 
02:26:56.389 --> 02:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
supreme court society has worked on a
 
02:26:58.150 --> 02:26:58.160 align:start position:0%
project to identify
 
02:27:00.870 --> 02:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
important cases in the law so that we
 
02:27:04.309 --> 02:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
can at least start um in a prioritized
 
02:27:06.550 --> 02:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
way to draw those in
 
02:27:07.910 --> 02:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
as well
 
02:27:09.270 --> 02:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:27:11.270 --> 02:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
i know that um repeated use and
 
02:27:13.030 --> 02:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
environment are
 
02:27:16.389 --> 02:27:16.399 align:start position:0%
the antithesis of good book preservation
 
02:27:18.630 --> 02:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
uh is it do you have any estimate on on
 
02:27:20.950 --> 02:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
how much material this is probably maybe
 
02:27:23.190 --> 02:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
just a guess at this point you've lost
 
02:27:25.590 --> 02:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
due to those conditions
 
02:27:27.349 --> 02:27:27.359 align:start position:0%
so far
 
02:27:29.190 --> 02:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
and i think it's
 
02:27:32.550 --> 02:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
it's a you know hat tip to whoever built
 
02:27:36.070 --> 02:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
our building we haven't lost
 
02:27:38.710 --> 02:27:38.720 align:start position:0%
anything some of the pages in some of
 
02:27:40.790 --> 02:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
the older books when mary gets them out
 
02:27:42.630 --> 02:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
with the white gloves
 
02:27:42.640 --> 02:27:43.670 align:start position:0%
with the white gloves
they're

02:27:43.670 --> 02:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
they're
 
02:27:43.680 --> 02:27:44.950 align:start position:0%
they're
fragile

02:27:44.950 --> 02:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
fragile
 
02:27:47.270 --> 02:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
but we haven't had any of the
 
02:27:49.910 --> 02:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
total books you know disintegrate and we
 
02:27:52.870 --> 02:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
haven't had any of the old books or old
 
02:27:56.469 --> 02:27:56.479 align:start position:0%
documents um disintegrate so far so it
 
02:27:59.830 --> 02:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
is really a a testament to the building
 
02:28:02.309 --> 02:28:02.319 align:start position:0%
and also the time is right to start this
 
02:28:02.319 --> 02:28:03.429 align:start position:0%
and also the time is right to start this
project

02:28:03.429 --> 02:28:03.439 align:start position:0%
project
 
02:28:05.429 --> 02:28:05.439 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you
 
02:28:05.439 --> 02:28:06.630 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you
representative

02:28:06.630 --> 02:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:28:06.640 --> 02:28:07.830 align:start position:0%
representative
um

02:28:07.830 --> 02:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:10.469 --> 02:28:10.479 align:start position:0%
you did mention that it would cost about
 
02:28:13.670 --> 02:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
2 million to do all of them if
 
02:28:16.389 --> 02:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
if you got the entire 2 million would
 
02:28:18.950 --> 02:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
you be able to spend it all in one
 
02:28:22.150 --> 02:28:22.160 align:start position:0%
biennium or is the the plan that we
 
02:28:25.910 --> 02:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
started on two years ago the way to go
 
02:28:29.590 --> 02:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
do it and do it right over a period as
 
02:28:31.670 --> 02:28:31.680 align:start position:0%
as we go forward
 
02:28:33.990 --> 02:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
i am sure that northeast document
 
02:28:37.270 --> 02:28:37.280 align:start position:0%
conservation center would ramp up and do
 
02:28:40.550 --> 02:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
it all in one biennium
 
02:28:43.429 --> 02:28:43.439 align:start position:0%
again i am most concerned with the
 
02:28:45.590 --> 02:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
oldest first
 
02:28:45.600 --> 02:28:47.190 align:start position:0%
oldest first
so

02:28:47.190 --> 02:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:28:49.510 --> 02:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
i think a staged proposal and you're
 
02:28:51.990 --> 02:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
involved we had we talked about this
 
02:28:54.790 --> 02:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
two years ago and i'm sure this price
 
02:28:57.990 --> 02:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
from 2018 might have gone up
 
02:29:00.710 --> 02:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
but i think staging it makes sense
 
02:29:00.720 --> 02:29:05.990 align:start position:0%
but i think staging it makes sense
absolutely

02:29:05.990 --> 02:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:07.510 --> 02:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:29:16.550 --> 02:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:20.710 --> 02:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:23.429 --> 02:29:23.439 align:start position:0%
uh p's development authority is next up
 
02:29:25.110 --> 02:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
i'd like to invite you to come up for
 
02:29:53.920 --> 02:29:53.930 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:53.930 --> 02:29:59.110 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:29:59.110 --> 02:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:26.870 --> 02:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:35.110 --> 02:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:37.349 --> 02:30:37.359 align:start position:0%

geno marconi i'm the director at the
 
02:30:44.309 --> 02:30:44.319 align:start position:0%
new hampshire port authority which is a
 
02:30:45.830 --> 02:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
division of the peas development
 
02:30:48.389 --> 02:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
authority with me is uh
 
02:30:50.790 --> 02:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
the p's executive director paul breen
 
02:30:54.230 --> 02:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
and also with us is uh susie anzalone
 
02:30:56.870 --> 02:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
who is our finance director
 
02:30:59.750 --> 02:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh so what you have before you today is
 
02:31:03.349 --> 02:31:03.359 align:start position:0%
is a couple of requests uh one of which
 
02:31:05.110 --> 02:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
uh we're going to
 
02:31:07.429 --> 02:31:07.439 align:start position:0%
withdraw from from the capital budget
 
02:31:09.030 --> 02:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
because uh
 
02:31:11.590 --> 02:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
uh we got some funding uh through the
 
02:31:14.710 --> 02:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
opera program but the first one you have
 
02:31:17.590 --> 02:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
is a is a small dredging project
 
02:31:17.600 --> 02:31:19.590 align:start position:0%
is a is a small dredging project
um

02:31:19.590 --> 02:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:19.600 --> 02:31:21.830 align:start position:0%
um
when

02:31:21.830 --> 02:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
when
 
02:31:24.309 --> 02:31:24.319 align:start position:0%
new hampshire d.o.t built the sarah
 
02:31:26.790 --> 02:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
mildred long bridge
 
02:31:29.349 --> 02:31:29.359 align:start position:0%
we lost part of our facility down there
 
02:31:31.510 --> 02:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire d.o.t and federal
 
02:31:33.270 --> 02:31:33.280 align:start position:0%
highway agreed to give us a
 
02:31:35.670 --> 02:31:35.680 align:start position:0%
functional replacement to make us whole
 
02:31:38.550 --> 02:31:38.560 align:start position:0%
again and part of that project is is
 
02:31:41.270 --> 02:31:41.280 align:start position:0%
dredging and it's a it's a big piece of
 
02:31:43.270 --> 02:31:43.280 align:start position:0%
uh dredge in
 
02:31:45.110 --> 02:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
where the new facility is going to be
 
02:31:46.630 --> 02:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
added on to
 
02:31:48.710 --> 02:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
but we also need to do a small dredge
 
02:31:51.270 --> 02:31:51.280 align:start position:0%
alongside the face of the pier it's
 
02:31:53.429 --> 02:31:53.439 align:start position:0%
i call it a maintenance dredge the army
 
02:31:55.830 --> 02:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
corps of engineers said no it's a it's a
 
02:31:57.349 --> 02:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
separate project
 
02:31:58.630 --> 02:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
02:32:01.110 --> 02:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
it would be advantageous for us to do
 
02:32:03.190 --> 02:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
that maintenance dredge at the same time
 
02:32:05.510 --> 02:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
that uh the functional replacement
 
02:32:07.910 --> 02:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
project is so that's what this first
 
02:32:09.830 --> 02:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
request you have here for six hundred
 
02:32:11.990 --> 02:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
and twenty one thousand dollars
 
02:32:14.870 --> 02:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's based on uh current uh
 
02:32:16.950 --> 02:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
costs for dredge material
 
02:32:20.469 --> 02:32:20.479 align:start position:0%
it's a really small project it's about
 
02:32:23.190 --> 02:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
thirteen hundred cubic yards but we to
 
02:32:26.150 --> 02:32:26.160 align:start position:0%
do that at the same time that the the
 
02:32:28.389 --> 02:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
functional replacement project is being
 
02:32:31.030 --> 02:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
done and that whole project's 34 million
 
02:32:32.230 --> 02:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
dollars so
 
02:32:38.150 --> 02:32:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:40.550 --> 02:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
and then this the second project you
 
02:32:43.830 --> 02:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
have in there is uh uh funds to do uh
 
02:32:46.550 --> 02:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
decking and cross bracing uh on the
 
02:32:48.870 --> 02:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
portsmouth commercial fish pier uh we'd
 
02:32:50.830 --> 02:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
like to withdraw that one because as i
 
02:32:53.190 --> 02:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
said last week
 
02:32:54.950 --> 02:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
governor and council and the
 
02:32:57.030 --> 02:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee approved that that
 
02:33:08.630 --> 02:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:11.110 --> 02:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
and then the third one is uh is an
 
02:33:14.150 --> 02:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
important project uh it's it's a uh you
 
02:33:15.910 --> 02:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
know it's out a little bit further than
 
02:33:17.270 --> 02:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
the other ones
 
02:33:17.280 --> 02:33:18.790 align:start position:0%
the other ones
um

02:33:18.790 --> 02:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:21.030 --> 02:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
i'll give you a little history a couple
 
02:33:22.630 --> 02:33:22.640 align:start position:0%
of years ago the sea wall at the
 
02:33:24.230 --> 02:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
portsmouth fish pier
 
02:33:24.240 --> 02:33:25.190 align:start position:0%
portsmouth fish pier
failed

02:33:25.190 --> 02:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
failed
 
02:33:27.429 --> 02:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
and the legislature funded
 
02:33:30.150 --> 02:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
appropriated 3.25 million dollars to do
 
02:33:32.070 --> 02:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
that project that project's been
 
02:33:32.080 --> 02:33:33.670 align:start position:0%
that project that project's been
completed

02:33:33.670 --> 02:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
completed
 
02:33:35.910 --> 02:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
but the building that's there was built
 
02:33:35.920 --> 02:33:36.910 align:start position:0%
but the building that's there was built
in

02:33:36.910 --> 02:33:36.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:33:41.830 --> 02:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
1977 78 and uh it's it's a wood building
 
02:33:44.309 --> 02:33:44.319 align:start position:0%
and in that environment
 
02:33:46.870 --> 02:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
the building's old it's falling apart
 
02:33:49.030 --> 02:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
it really needs to be replaced and
 
02:33:51.670 --> 02:33:51.680 align:start position:0%
that's what this request is for
 
02:33:53.429 --> 02:33:53.439 align:start position:0%
inside that building are two
 
02:33:56.630 --> 02:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
refrigerated cold storage facilities
 
02:34:00.230 --> 02:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
some small office space and a work area
 
02:34:00.240 --> 02:34:01.510 align:start position:0%
some small office space and a work area
where

02:34:01.510 --> 02:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:34:04.230 --> 02:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
seafood can be handled
 
02:34:06.070 --> 02:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
out of the sun especially in the
 
02:34:08.469 --> 02:34:08.479 align:start position:0%
summertime and that's what that request
 
02:34:10.389 --> 02:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
there is is for
 
02:34:12.309 --> 02:34:12.319 align:start position:0%
a million five
 
02:34:14.070 --> 02:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
two three to replace that building at
 
02:34:16.469 --> 02:34:16.479 align:start position:0%
the portsmouth commercial fish pier and
 
02:34:21.110 --> 02:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:23.429 --> 02:34:23.439 align:start position:0%
how excuse me how long how large is the
 
02:34:25.590 --> 02:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
building in in portsmouth on the fishing
 
02:34:25.600 --> 02:34:27.030 align:start position:0%
building in in portsmouth on the fishing
pier

02:34:27.030 --> 02:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
pier
 
02:34:27.910 --> 02:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
the fish
 
02:34:35.590 --> 02:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:37.990 --> 02:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
fifty six hundred fifty six hundred i
 
02:34:42.230 --> 02:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:44.070 --> 02:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
and is there the cost just to replace
 
02:34:45.349 --> 02:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
the building or the building and the
 
02:34:47.270 --> 02:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
equipment inside including um there is
 
02:34:48.630 --> 02:34:48.640 align:start position:0%
some equipment
 
02:34:49.990 --> 02:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
if i can give you a little bit more
 
02:34:51.750 --> 02:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
background please
 
02:34:55.110 --> 02:34:55.120 align:start position:0%
originally we had been planning on
 
02:34:56.870 --> 02:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh building a whole new building and
 
02:34:58.870 --> 02:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
thinking about relocating it on the
 
02:35:01.429 --> 02:35:01.439 align:start position:0%
property to make the facility more
 
02:35:03.349 --> 02:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
efficient for trucks loading and
 
02:35:05.349 --> 02:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
unloading but when we were doing the
 
02:35:07.670 --> 02:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
seawall because it was so close to the
 
02:35:10.389 --> 02:35:10.399 align:start position:0%
edge of the wall
 
02:35:12.870 --> 02:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
when we dug down alongside of it we
 
02:35:14.630 --> 02:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
realized that the footings in the in
 
02:35:17.349 --> 02:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
were in really good shape uh during the
 
02:35:19.590 --> 02:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
project because of the pile driving and
 
02:35:21.990 --> 02:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
the heavy equipment running around
 
02:35:24.630 --> 02:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
the floor drain in in the two coolers
 
02:35:27.670 --> 02:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
and in the work area uh failed they were
 
02:35:29.990 --> 02:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
old and the vibrating everything they
 
02:35:31.030 --> 02:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
failed so
 
02:35:33.910 --> 02:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh we went in and saw cut the floor out
 
02:35:36.309 --> 02:35:36.319 align:start position:0%
to replace the drains and we didn't have
 
02:35:39.590 --> 02:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
any as built of the of the building
 
02:35:41.349 --> 02:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
we thought there was you know eight to
 
02:35:43.349 --> 02:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
ten inches of concrete on the floor
 
02:35:45.270 --> 02:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
found out that the floor was 19 inches
 
02:35:45.280 --> 02:35:46.389 align:start position:0%
found out that the floor was 19 inches
thick

02:35:46.389 --> 02:35:46.399 align:start position:0%
thick
 
02:35:49.270 --> 02:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
so we put in new new floor drains we've
 
02:35:51.590 --> 02:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
got new utilities going in there now
 
02:35:54.150 --> 02:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
water and electricity it's all been
 
02:35:56.309 --> 02:35:56.319 align:start position:0%
upgraded so we step back and say you
 
02:35:57.670 --> 02:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
know why do we want to reinvent the
 
02:36:00.070 --> 02:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
wheel here why don't we just replace the
 
02:36:01.830 --> 02:36:01.840 align:start position:0%
building on the existing footprint
 
02:36:03.830 --> 02:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
because the foundation utilities are all
 
02:36:05.270 --> 02:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
still there so
 
02:36:07.830 --> 02:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's why we came up with a much
 
02:36:10.070 --> 02:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
reduced estimate on what what needs to
 
02:36:11.110 --> 02:36:11.120 align:start position:0%
be done
 
02:36:12.790 --> 02:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
the only
 
02:36:16.790 --> 02:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
caveat with the building is that
 
02:36:19.349 --> 02:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
back in the 70s when the state bought
 
02:36:21.190 --> 02:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
this piece of property
 
02:36:23.429 --> 02:36:23.439 align:start position:0%
the state bought the shoreline on pierce
 
02:36:25.190 --> 02:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
island from the city of portsmouth for a
 
02:36:25.200 --> 02:36:26.230 align:start position:0%
island from the city of portsmouth for a
dollar

02:36:26.230 --> 02:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
02:36:27.910 --> 02:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
and then they built
 
02:36:31.270 --> 02:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh a revetment and they and when they
 
02:36:33.349 --> 02:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
when they dredged for the fish pier that
 
02:36:35.910 --> 02:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
was the where they uh disposed of the
 
02:36:38.309 --> 02:36:38.319 align:start position:0%
spoils which made the
 
02:36:41.190 --> 02:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
actual land that the facility is on
 
02:36:41.200 --> 02:36:42.070 align:start position:0%
actual land that the facility is on
um

02:36:42.070 --> 02:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:43.510 --> 02:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
in that
 
02:36:45.349 --> 02:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
purchase of the property there are a
 
02:36:48.550 --> 02:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
couple of deed restrictions one is if if
 
02:36:50.150 --> 02:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
it's ever not used for commercial
 
02:36:53.270 --> 02:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
fishing reverse back to the city and two
 
02:36:55.670 --> 02:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
is that any structures on the facility
 
02:36:58.950 --> 02:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
have to be architecturally compatible
 
02:37:01.349 --> 02:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
with the neighborhood so that's one of
 
02:37:02.950 --> 02:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
the things that we will have to work
 
02:37:05.429 --> 02:37:05.439 align:start position:0%
with the city on because
 
02:37:07.750 --> 02:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
it's located in the historic district of
 
02:37:09.990 --> 02:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
portsmouth and
 
02:37:11.910 --> 02:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
you know we have a obligation to make
 
02:37:13.590 --> 02:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
those facilities
 
02:37:16.150 --> 02:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
compatible with the city
 
02:37:21.110 --> 02:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:23.910 --> 02:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
but i'm just going to note that it's um
 
02:37:25.670 --> 02:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
it's quite rare that the capital budget
 
02:37:27.670 --> 02:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
hearings are concluded with a husband
 
02:37:29.910 --> 02:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
and wife tag team
 
02:37:32.389 --> 02:37:32.399 align:start position:0%
and so i certainly appreciate that
 
02:37:35.349 --> 02:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
well she is the smarter of the two of us
 
02:37:37.349 --> 02:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
it's commissioner well you said that not
 
02:37:37.359 --> 02:37:38.389 align:start position:0%
it's commissioner well you said that not

for attending these hearings and
 
02:38:12.630 --> 02:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
participating i think there there is
 
02:38:15.590 --> 02:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
even we have people here who are who are
 
02:38:17.510 --> 02:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
decided not to run again
 
02:38:19.510 --> 02:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
and but they still care enough about
 
02:38:20.550 --> 02:38:20.560 align:start position:0%

members of the community but especially
 
02:38:36.550 --> 02:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
department administrative services
 
02:38:39.670 --> 02:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
who did a fantastic job uh despite even
 
02:38:41.670 --> 02:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
last-minute changes major changes at the
 
02:38:43.510 --> 02:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
last minute and handled it in an
 
02:38:45.510 --> 02:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
extremely professional way so couldn't
 
02:38:47.510 --> 02:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
have done it without you thank you
 
02:38:49.830 --> 02:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
it's worth noting that don howe did a
 
02:38:52.070 --> 02:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
ton of work um on the logistical side
 
02:38:52.870 --> 02:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:38:54.870 --> 02:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
michelle carraway and her team
 
02:38:56.469 --> 02:38:56.479 align:start position:0%
does a lot of work and
 
02:38:58.230 --> 02:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
and i just sit here
 
02:39:00.710 --> 02:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
and just for those who may be listening
 
02:39:02.790 --> 02:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
in if you could just touch on
 
02:39:05.270 --> 02:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
now that you've heard all of this from
 
02:39:07.270 --> 02:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
the governor's perspective what happens
 
02:39:10.630 --> 02:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
now with all the information you got
 
02:39:12.230 --> 02:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
well with all the information we got now
 
02:39:14.790 --> 02:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
we go back and i uh talk to the governor
 
02:39:16.710 --> 02:39:16.720 align:start position:0%
and we go through and
 
02:39:20.230 --> 02:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
his target is 125 million so
 
02:39:22.710 --> 02:39:22.720 align:start position:0%
we need to whittle down what was roughly
 
02:39:26.150 --> 02:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
330 million down to 125 million he then
 
02:39:28.150 --> 02:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
makes that recommendation
 
02:39:30.469 --> 02:39:30.479 align:start position:0%
to the legislature and the legislature
 
02:39:32.309 --> 02:39:32.319 align:start position:0%
takes it from there
 
02:39:33.429 --> 02:39:33.439 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:39:34.630 --> 02:39:34.640 align:start position:0%
with any luck the governor will see it
 
02:39:37.670 --> 02:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:40.070 --> 02:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
with that the governor's capital budget
 
02:40:05.830 --> 02:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:05.840 --> 02:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
you
