uh representative lay would like to
 
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.670 align:start position:0%
uh representative lay would like to
speak

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
no one has anything to discuss on
 
00:07:53.189 --> 00:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
forward 41. no
 
00:07:56.469 --> 00:07:56.479 align:start position:0%
matter the chair chair uh i'm douglas
 
00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
representative lay is raising his hand
 
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative
 
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair yeah um you know i
 
00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
think there's merit to the
 
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
uh ideas here i think the bill as
 
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
currently written
 
00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
would have issues i i think we talked
 
00:08:10.869 --> 00:08:10.879 align:start position:0%
about that in the
 
00:08:13.029 --> 00:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
in the hearing we did have on it um but
 
00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
i do think there's merit and
 
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
um i think the idea is not a bad one um
 
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
particularly on identifying
 
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh or disclosing the source of certain
 
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
legislation there are some
 
00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:25.360 align:start position:0%
quirks and how that would have to be
 
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
done uh particularly if it comes from
 
00:08:29.189 --> 00:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
multiple sources things like that
 
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
i also noted that in the past there was
 
00:08:33.509 --> 00:08:33.519 align:start position:0%
a proposal to maybe put something into
 
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
house rules
 
00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:36.320 align:start position:0%
um and that may be an alternative
 
00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:38.240 align:start position:0%
pathway so uh
 
00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
you know i i i actually see some merit
 
00:08:42.469 --> 00:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
to this as for the uh
 
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh the disclosure of certain information
 
00:08:46.389 --> 00:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
i think that one
 
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
that was a difficult part of this bill
 
00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
if i recall
 
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
um that was the bit about the phone
 
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
calling and things like that so
 
00:08:55.509 --> 00:08:55.519 align:start position:0%
i'm not so sure about that but certainly
 
00:08:56.949 --> 00:08:56.959 align:start position:0%
on the disclosure
 
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
uh of looking towards maybe crafting
 
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
something to permit disclosure of
 
00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
uh sources of model legislation maybe
 
00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
with the permission of
 
00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:08.959 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor something like that
 
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
that might be okay
 
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
so that's my two cents i agree with you
 
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
on that um
 
00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
i i have the background of the history
 
00:09:18.389 --> 00:09:18.399 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:21.680 align:start position:0%
the bill has been presented twice before
 
00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
and has been found inexpedient to
 
00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
legislate both times before based on the
 
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
fact that
 
00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
it might be better it's a good idea
 
00:09:31.509 --> 00:09:31.519 align:start position:0%
and at the same time it might be better
 
00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
to deal with it in terms of house rules
 
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
and that's why it's been killed before
 
00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:37.430 align:start position:0%
and that's why it's been killed before
uh

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
actually with house rules as you all
 
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
know we we vote
 
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
on our rules at the beginning of each
 
00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
two-year session
 
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:46.720 align:start position:0%
and we're never going to have something
 
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
go through all the hearings and all the
 
00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
processes and all it might be
 
00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
beneficial to have this go through rules
 
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
but i
 
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
i would go along with what the committee
 
00:09:59.110 --> 00:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
wants anyone else
 
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
i just the technical thing
 
00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
representative rice has having a
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
an issue her screen froze she had a log
 
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
off and she's coming back down
 
00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
momentarily oh
 
00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:11.509 align:start position:0%
momentarily oh
okay

00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
and uh representative graham has his
 
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
hand up oh did he
 
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
see it thank you madam chairman aye
 
00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
representative graham go ahead right um
 
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
i agree with the fact that it should be
 
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
in rules if we are going to go
 
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
forward with this that way um our
 
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
membership gets to pick and choose
 
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
every two years on how to modify
 
00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
this rather than trying to take it
 
00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
through legislation
 
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
which as we all know is so easy to
 
00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:42.710 align:start position:0%
which as we all know is so easy to
change

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
once we put in the statute
 
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
sarcasm for anybody listening
 
00:10:54.069 --> 00:10:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
doug do you see anyone else from here uh
 
00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
i do not i haven't spoke representative
 
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
wilhelm has his hand up
 
00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
can i just ask as we move to executive
 
00:11:05.279 --> 00:11:05.829 align:start position:0%
can i just ask as we move to executive
session

00:11:05.829 --> 00:11:05.839 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
this is just a question about process
 
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
do we make a recommendation uh
 
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
how did how did how does it how does it
 
00:11:16.069 --> 00:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
work i know how to vote
 
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
vote a bill up or down but it's unclear
 
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
i should have said something in the very
 
00:11:22.949 --> 00:11:22.959 align:start position:0%
beginning we have two options
 
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
we can recommend for further legislation
 
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:26.150 align:start position:0%
we can recommend for further legislation
or

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
we can not recommend for future
 
00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.509 align:start position:0%
we can not recommend for future
legislation

00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
and either way my personal opinion is
 
00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
it doesn't truly make a huge difference
 
00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.150 align:start position:0%
it doesn't truly make a huge difference
because

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
we can't bind a future legislature
 
00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:42.399 align:start position:0%
and anyone who wants can file any one of
 
00:11:43.509 --> 00:11:43.519 align:start position:0%
these bills
 
00:11:46.389 --> 00:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
for the next session but we need to go
 
00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
through this process
 
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:50.720 align:start position:0%
because because it's the process we have
 
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
so we will need a recommend we will need
 
00:11:55.509 --> 00:11:55.519 align:start position:0%
a motion either to recommend or not
 
00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
recommend for future legislation when we
 
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
move into our exact session
 
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
i know it sounds a little confusing and
 
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
then uh madam chair may i ask a question
 
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:09.839 align:start position:0%
excuse me madam chair may i ask a
 
00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:11.839 align:start position:0%
question as well this is representative
 
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you thank you uh and this is
 
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
really just for anybody who hasn't gone
 
00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:17.200 align:start position:0%
through the process before so
 
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
there are also uh there's a committee
 
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
report or whatever on this
 
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
i mean it's uh you know what you will be
 
00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
a committee statement yeah
 
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
yes yeah okay and so any sort of
 
00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:28.790 align:start position:0%
yes yeah okay and so any sort of
explanation

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
explanation
 
00:12:30.949 --> 00:12:30.959 align:start position:0%
uh could be contained therein okay very
 
00:12:32.629 --> 00:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
good thank you
 
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
exactly and this won't be taken up on
 
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
the floor of the house what we're doing
 
00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%
is forwarding our
 
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
it won't be the blurb it won't be the
 
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
committee report this time they're
 
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
calling it the committee statement
 
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
so we will make a statement now if we
 
00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:45.279 align:start position:0%
make a statement
 
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh recommending future legislation that
 
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
may strengthen an issue
 
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
or it may not if we
 
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation not recommend or
 
00:12:57.269 --> 00:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
make a motion rather
 
00:12:59.910 --> 00:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
not recommending future legislation and
 
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
once again
 
00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:03.839 align:start position:0%
anyone can file a bill if they want to
 
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
so it kind of puts people in a hard
 
00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
place at times i think but
 
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
just think about whether or not you
 
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
think this is the way we should go
 
00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
should we on this particular bill
 
00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.269 align:start position:0%
should we on this particular bill
recommend

00:13:15.269 --> 00:13:15.279 align:start position:0%
recommend
 
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
for future legislation or should we
 
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
allow the rules committee to take over
 
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
and us vote on it when the time comes i
 
00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
think that's what it's going to boil
 
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:32.069 --> 00:13:32.079 align:start position:0%
thank you sorry about that i got booted
 
00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
um so if i missed something please bear
 
00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
with me but i think that if this can go
 
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
to rules that that's
 
00:13:39.829 --> 00:13:39.839 align:start position:0%
where we should let it go i don't think
 
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
putting it in stat
 
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
you really ties our hands and limits
 
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
things so i
 
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
i would like to see us just recommend
 
00:13:49.189 --> 00:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
you know no further legislation let's
 
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
bring it in front of rules
 
00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
okay representative wilhelm did you have
 
00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:57.279 align:start position:0%
your hand up again
 
00:14:01.269 --> 00:14:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
anyone else i see
 
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
no one with a hand up
 
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
no or not are you caught going once
 
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
going twice
 
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry so shall i auction it off
 
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
okay if you're comfortable with where
 
00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
you think you're going with this
 
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
hold on to your motion please we'll move
 
00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
on to house bill 1359
 
00:14:32.949 --> 00:14:32.959 align:start position:0%
relative to employment as a lobbyist tim
 
00:14:34.629 --> 00:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
smith put this in
 
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:38.240 align:start position:0%
and the biggest question on the bill was
 
00:14:40.389 --> 00:14:40.399 align:start position:0%
how much time we should allow between an
 
00:14:40.399 --> 00:14:41.350 align:start position:0%
how much time we should allow between an
individual

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
being a legislator and becoming a
 
00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
lobbyist and according to research that
 
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
we got from pam smarling on 38 states
 
00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:53.519 align:start position:0%
have some type of uh law regarding this
 
00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
and they vary from the length of
 
00:15:00.069 --> 00:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
say you leave your um seat mid-term or
 
00:15:00.079 --> 00:15:00.790 align:start position:0%
say you leave your um seat mid-term or
something

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:15:04.389 --> 00:15:04.399 align:start position:0%
if the midterm would be one year
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
you'd have to wait a year before you
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
came became a lobbyist or say you
 
00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
finished your term
 
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
you'd still have to wait then two years
 
00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:12.959 align:start position:0%
before coming along becoming
 
00:15:17.509 --> 00:15:17.519 align:start position:0%
a lobbyist so and some states have it
 
00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
for as much as two years or longer
 
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
so the question is how long in new
 
00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:24.310 align:start position:0%
so the question is how long in new
hampshire

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:15:26.949 --> 00:15:26.959 align:start position:0%
i will tell you that on election day i
 
00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
was standing with a former legislator
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
from up
 
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
um i would call it the north country who
 
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
came down to support
 
00:15:35.829 --> 00:15:35.839 align:start position:0%
a particular candidate and i asked her
 
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
when she became a lobbyist and she moved
 
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
straight from being a
 
00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
legislator to being a lobbyist i talked
 
00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
with someone else
 
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:46.240 align:start position:0%
who waited two years so it does vary
 
00:15:49.509 --> 00:15:49.519 align:start position:0%
right within our own state
 
00:15:52.629 --> 00:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
we are all volunteers and
 
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
i would not feel comfortable personally
 
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
having to wait as long as something like
 
00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
four years
 
00:15:59.670 --> 00:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
because anyone can get a paying job i
 
00:16:02.069 --> 00:16:02.079 align:start position:0%
hope within four years and not have to
 
00:16:02.079 --> 00:16:02.470 align:start position:0%
hope within four years and not have to
wait

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
wait
 
00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
for the job of their dreams to be a
 
00:16:04.639 --> 00:16:05.829 align:start position:0%
for the job of their dreams to be a
lobbyist

00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:05.839 align:start position:0%
lobbyist
 
00:16:08.069 --> 00:16:08.079 align:start position:0%
so the question is how long should
 
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
anyone wait
 
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
so i think that they'll have some merit
 
00:16:16.389 --> 00:16:16.399 align:start position:0%
um i'd like to hear from others
 
00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:18.959 align:start position:0%
representative rice has her hand up
 
00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
um so i'm very uncomfortable with
 
00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:26.720 align:start position:0%
telling people they can't take a job as
 
00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
you stated we are volunteer legislators
 
00:16:31.269 --> 00:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
we make a hundred dollars a year
 
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
and i don't know about you guys but i
 
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
spend a lot of time doing this
 
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not making a killing if a job
 
00:16:39.189 --> 00:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity came to me i would want to
 
00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:41.759 align:start position:0%
have that make that decision on my own
 
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
not have the legislature
 
00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:46.720 align:start position:0%
a statute make that for me um
 
00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
so i i can't support this going forward
 
00:16:49.519 --> 00:16:50.389 align:start position:0%
so i i can't support this going forward
and

00:16:50.389 --> 00:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
and because i i'm just not comfortable
 
00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
with telling anyone you can't take a job
 
00:16:59.430 --> 00:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
if the opportunity presents itself
 
00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else
 
00:17:06.789 --> 00:17:06.799 align:start position:0%
come on right here representative
 
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:14.949 --> 00:17:14.959 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative green go ahead
 
00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:15.919 align:start position:0%
go ahead okay
 
00:17:18.309 --> 00:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
yes uh i'm concerned about the bill too
 
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
i mean all right
 
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
we've discussed this all in the past
 
00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:23.510 align:start position:0%
we've discussed this all in the past
just

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
there's just some vagueness about this
 
00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:26.549 align:start position:0%
there's just some vagueness about this
about

00:17:26.549 --> 00:17:26.559 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
discussing negotiating playing with the
 
00:17:30.789 --> 00:17:30.799 align:start position:0%
lobby as a lobbyist client say
 
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
i i'll be the legislature i want to go
 
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
back to my old employer
 
00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
bae systems now uh that be
 
00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:41.039 align:start position:0%
uh they have a pack you know
 
00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
i and even though if i'm not a member i
 
00:17:43.679 --> 00:17:45.110 align:start position:0%
i and even though if i'm not a member i
mean

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
mean
 
00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
how there's a lot of details are left
 
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
out of this bill as what like
 
00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
this a lobbyist or lobbyist client
 
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
i guess that's what i'm feeling with
 
00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.750 align:start position:0%
i guess that's what i'm feeling with
this

00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:00.549 --> 00:18:00.559 align:start position:0%
who else had the hand up pam
 
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
representative graham
 
00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
ah representative graham representative
 
00:18:06.789 --> 00:18:06.799 align:start position:0%
graham's ready uh madam chair
 
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i i agree with
 
00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
um representative rice and
 
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
representative greene that
 
00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
we probably should not support
 
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
recommendation for further legislation
 
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
as you mentioned madam chair there are
 
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
38 states
 
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
that have some kind of law on this but
 
00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
i'm willing to bet you my hundred
 
00:18:30.789 --> 00:18:30.799 align:start position:0%
dollars for this year
 
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
that they do not make as little as we do
 
00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
um for all the time that they put in
 
00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
i know in mass it's in the tens of
 
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
thousands i won't say how much
 
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
but um i think that
 
00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
it is something that we should not put
 
00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
into legislation
 
00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
it it really is a fact that we come out
 
00:18:59.590 --> 00:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
of a volunteer legislator
 
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
um and then if i'm offered a job maybe i
 
00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:04.720 align:start position:0%
want to take it probably i don't
 
00:19:06.549 --> 00:19:06.559 align:start position:0%
but especially the way this one is
 
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
currently done i have to wait
 
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
36 years to
 
00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
before i could take the job i don't
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
think i'll
 
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
be doing it at that point but i don't
 
00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
think i'm going to go forward on this
 
00:19:22.549 --> 00:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
okay i hope you're around 36 years from
 
00:19:22.559 --> 00:19:23.350 align:start position:0%
okay i hope you're around 36 years from
now

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
i will say that in research from tam
 
00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:26.470 align:start position:0%
i will say that in research from tam
smarling

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:26.480 align:start position:0%

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.320 align:start position:0%

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:29.750 align:start position:0%
the executive branch and classified
employees

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:32.240 align:start position:0%
do have to wait for six months the
 
00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
bill's come before
 
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
the house a couple of other times and it
 
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
has been killed
 
00:19:39.909 --> 00:19:39.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
so i'm just putting that out there from
 
00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
is anyone else represent representative
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
frost and then representative wilhelm
 
00:19:53.029 --> 00:19:53.039 align:start position:0%
um thank you i'd like to clarify that
 
00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
says that you are um would be
 
00:19:59.350 --> 00:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
restricted from accepting a position for
 
00:20:01.029 --> 00:20:01.039 align:start position:0%
a period of time equal to twice the
 
00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
total length of their current term in
 
00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:03.510 align:start position:0%
total length of their current term in
office

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
which means four years not 36.
 
00:20:09.029 --> 00:20:09.039 align:start position:0%
that's a good point yeah and i think
 
00:20:10.549 --> 00:20:10.559 align:start position:0%
that goes back to what i said if you
 
00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
leave midterm you only have to wait
 
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
another year
 
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
if you leave after the end of year two
 
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
that's correct okay
 
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
oh no no no i take that bet twice the
 
00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
total length of your current term
 
00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
so if you spend two years you have to
 
00:20:30.549 --> 00:20:30.559 align:start position:0%
wait four years
 
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
right yeah right
 
00:20:37.029 --> 00:20:37.039 align:start position:0%
representative wilhelm has this hand up
 
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify when it comes to
 
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
recommending legislation
 
00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
for the future or not it's
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
you know if there are details in it that
 
00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
were we think needs to be
 
00:20:54.549 --> 00:20:54.559 align:start position:0%
refined further uh is there an
 
00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to clarify that or it's just
 
00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.310 align:start position:0%
opportunity to clarify that or it's just
simply

00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
simply
 
00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
you know this bill should be considered
 
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
moving forward or not
 
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
um doug help me with this one please i
 
00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:05.750 align:start position:0%
um doug help me with this one please i
believe

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:21:07.669 --> 00:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
that you can that we're doing it based
 
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
on the concept and we can have the
 
00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:09.990 align:start position:0%
on the concept and we can have the
wording

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
wording
 
00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
the way we would want it is that correct
 
00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
just means future legislation it doesn't
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
mean it has to be the identical bill
 
00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
does it well i i mean obviously any
 
00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
madam chair may i speak it doesn't have
 
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
you know we're not rec we don't have to
 
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
be necessarily recommending the specific
 
00:21:29.909 --> 00:21:29.919 align:start position:0%
legislation i mean
 
00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
there can be the report
 
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
or statement can say you know that um
 
00:21:42.549 --> 00:21:42.559 align:start position:0%
the idea of uh of of a cooling period or
 
00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
whatever of for becoming a lobbyist may
 
00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
have some merit
 
00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
but perhaps not as long a period as is
 
00:21:50.549 --> 00:21:50.559 align:start position:0%
recommended here
 
00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
and there were also concerns about the
 
00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:54.310 align:start position:0%
and there were also concerns about the
um

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
the language about taking a job um that
 
00:21:59.430 --> 00:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
the sort of bae systems thing that i
 
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
remember we did discuss
 
00:22:02.789 --> 00:22:02.799 align:start position:0%
um that that would be somewhat
 
00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
problematic but um
 
00:22:07.669 --> 00:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
you know you could uh sort of state in
 
00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
the committee statement that
 
00:22:11.669 --> 00:22:11.679 align:start position:0%
there is some merit here perhaps not in
 
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
the exact language or the exact proposal
 
00:22:14.159 --> 00:22:14.789 align:start position:0%
the exact language or the exact proposal
here

00:22:14.789 --> 00:22:14.799 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:22:16.789 --> 00:22:16.799 align:start position:0%
um so i think that that's how you could
 
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
do it representative wilhelm
 
00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
that's that's what i was thinking um and
 
00:22:24.549 --> 00:22:24.559 align:start position:0%
um but again that doesn't bind anybody
 
00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
they can submit any way they want that's
 
00:22:29.909 --> 00:22:29.919 align:start position:0%
how i'm looking at it also there's
 
00:22:29.919 --> 00:22:30.470 align:start position:0%
how i'm looking at it also there's
another

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
second provision in this bill it says
 
00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:34.559 align:start position:0%
prohibition on employment offers from
 
00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
the lobbyists
 
00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
no member of the general court may
 
00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
negotiate an employment offer
 
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
with a lobbyist a lobbyist client or the
 
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
parent or subsidiary of the lobbyists
 
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
client while the members serving in
 
00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:45.990 align:start position:0%
client while the members serving in
office

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:22:48.549 --> 00:22:48.559 align:start position:0%
even if such employment would not begin
 
00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
until after the member's term of office
 
00:22:51.669 --> 00:22:51.679 align:start position:0%
has ended
 
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
yeah that was that was um representative
 
00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
greene's point
 
00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
er earlier um that the case yeah you
 
00:22:59.110 --> 00:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
going back to work
 
00:23:02.149 --> 00:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
representative frost has her hand up
 
00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
yeah um thank you so what i'm seeing in
 
00:23:06.149 --> 00:23:06.159 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
is that the employment would be
 
00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
prohibited if it would require
 
00:23:11.669 --> 00:23:11.679 align:start position:0%
registration as
 
00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
a lobbyist so you could still go back to
 
00:23:15.669 --> 00:23:15.679 align:start position:0%
your job
 
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
even if they had a lobbying arm or a
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
pac but if your employment would require
 
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
your registering as a lobbyist under rsa
 
00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:25.909 align:start position:0%
your registering as a lobbyist under rsa
15

00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:25.919 align:start position:0%
15
 
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
1 then that would be prohibited behavior
 
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
i don't i honestly don't see a problem
 
00:23:32.549 --> 00:23:32.559 align:start position:0%
with that i don't think this is keeping
 
00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
anybody from
 
00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
getting a paying job i think this is
 
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
getting forbidding people from taking a
 
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
paying job
 
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
that results from their term in
 
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
office that would require their being
 
00:23:49.029 --> 00:23:49.039 align:start position:0%
registered as a lobbyist it's that
 
00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
that um ethical gray area that we're
 
00:23:55.269 --> 00:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:58.230 --> 00:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
if i'm a madam chair i'm sorry yes
 
00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:59.269 align:start position:0%
if i'm a madam chair i'm sorry yes
representative

00:23:59.269 --> 00:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
um but what i see here is it states
 
00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
right here an employment offer with a
 
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
lobbyist a lobbyist
 
00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:10.799 align:start position:0%
client and to me that would that sounds
 
00:24:10.799 --> 00:24:11.430 align:start position:0%
client and to me that would that sounds
like

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:24:14.549 --> 00:24:14.559 align:start position:0%
um you know what representative greene
 
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
was stating about
 
00:24:19.029 --> 00:24:19.039 align:start position:0%
his work at bae or the parent or subsidy
 
00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
of a lobbyist client i mean i just
 
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
what i envision is all these branches
 
00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
going off and you can't have anything to
 
00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
do with
 
00:24:29.909 --> 00:24:29.919 align:start position:0%
what's at the end of these branches so
 
00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
be sure to really do your homework
 
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
because maybe you can't go to work there
 
00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
that's how i'm interpreting it where
 
00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
you know for me it just
 
00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
i i yeah do you know did i make any
 
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
sense at all
 
00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:48.400 align:start position:0%
yes to me you did um
 
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
am i am correct in thinking that city
 
00:24:52.789 --> 00:24:52.799 align:start position:0%
lobbyist is working for the hospital
 
00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
association you can't then work for the
 
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
hospital association
 
00:24:59.830 --> 00:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
even if you step out not being a
 
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
lobbyist but you can't even work for the
 
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
hospital association
 
00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
i mean that's the way you can't
 
00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
negotiate employment with the lobbyist
 
00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
representative graham has his hand up as
 
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
well go ahead
 
00:25:18.549 --> 00:25:18.559 align:start position:0%
and to follow along with that madam
 
00:25:18.559 --> 00:25:19.430 align:start position:0%
and to follow along with that madam
chair

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:25:21.909 --> 00:25:21.919 align:start position:0%
um any hospital that was part of the
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
hospital association you could not
 
00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
negotiate with
 
00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
if you take it to that logical
 
00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.549 align:start position:0%
if you take it to that logical
conclusion

00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
conclusion
 
00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
um but if we're not going to
 
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
beat this much longer i think that we
 
00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:38.240 align:start position:0%
can move on i think we've all made up
 
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
our mind on how we're going to vote on
 
00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:40.549 align:start position:0%
our mind on how we're going to vote on
this

00:25:40.549 --> 00:25:40.559 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
and on all three of them at this point i
 
00:25:45.269 --> 00:25:45.279 align:start position:0%
would assume
 
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
okay the voice of wisdom is everyone
 
00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
and could i just interject a little bit
 
00:25:57.269 --> 00:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
madam chairman

house bill 1669.
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
requiring electronic filing of lobbyist
 
00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
forms and statements
 
00:26:32.549 --> 00:26:32.559 align:start position:0%
the analysis says this bill requires
 
00:26:32.559 --> 00:26:33.029 align:start position:0%
the analysis says this bill requires
that

00:26:33.029 --> 00:26:33.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
one year after implementation of an
 
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
electronic filing system
 
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
by the secretary of state the
 
00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
registration forms and fee
 
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
and expense reports of lobbyists shall
 
00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
be filed electronically with the
 
00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:46.559 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
 
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
and made available as public records on
 
00:26:50.149 --> 00:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
on the department of
 
00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:54.400 align:start position:0%
state's internet site we had testimony
 
00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
i believe that said the secretary of
 
00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:57.430 align:start position:0%
i believe that said the secretary of
state's

00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
state's
 
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
office is in the process of
 
00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
getting these forms developed and i
 
00:27:05.669 --> 00:27:05.679 align:start position:0%
don't know what the status of that is
 
00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:11.039 align:start position:0%
representative graham has his hand up
 
00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know the status but i remember
 
00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
the deputy secretary saying it was
 
00:27:22.389 --> 00:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
supposed to be done this year
 
00:27:24.389 --> 00:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
but i'd be willing to bet that with all
 
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
the disruptions we've had
 
00:27:29.029 --> 00:27:29.039 align:start position:0%
that it's going to be delayed but he
 
00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
also didn't have any objections to
 
00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
to doing this the only question again
 
00:27:36.149 --> 00:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
that raises its head
 
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
is it better for the secretary of state
 
00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
to do it in administrative rules or is
 
00:27:44.789 --> 00:27:44.799 align:start position:0%
it better for us to put it into
 
00:27:44.799 --> 00:27:45.990 align:start position:0%
it better for us to put it into
legislation

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
and that's the real question that we we
 
00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
have to decide
 
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
when we decide whether to recommend to
 
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
go forward
 
00:27:56.389 --> 00:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
with this topic as legislation and to be
 
00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
put into the rsas or not
 
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
fully agree um does anyone else have
 
00:28:11.029 --> 00:28:11.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
as representatives lay would say going
 
00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.870 align:start position:0%
as representatives lay would say going
once

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
once
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
going twice have we completed our
 
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:18.710 align:start position:0%
going twice have we completed our
discussion

00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1669.
 
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
there's objection to that idea i guess
 
00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:25.990 align:start position:0%
there's objection to that idea i guess
so

00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
okay uh we will now move into our exact
 
00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:30.310 align:start position:0%
okay uh we will now move into our exact
session

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
so we will take these bills in the order
 
00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
in which we have discussed them
 
00:28:40.789 --> 00:28:40.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
and again the motions can be either that
 
00:28:46.389 --> 00:28:46.399 align:start position:0%
we do recommend for future legislation
 
00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
or we do not recommend for future
 
00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:50.950 align:start position:0%
or we do not recommend for future
legislation

00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:28:52.149 --> 00:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
i don't know who came first
 
00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
representative graham or representative
 
00:28:56.789 --> 00:28:56.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:58.240 align:start position:0%

um well in our statement that we make
 
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
if we for example if we say we do not
 
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
recommend for future legislation
 
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:19.360 align:start position:0%

00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
that the committee believes that
 
00:29:30.789 --> 00:29:30.799 align:start position:0%
this issue is better addressed through
 
00:29:30.799 --> 00:29:33.430 align:start position:0%
this issue is better addressed through
rules

00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:36.880 align:start position:0%

our former colleague gary richardson's
 
00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh blurb from the prior where he talks
 
00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
about the merit for
 
00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:42.559 align:start position:0%
this bill um that was heard before
 
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
and that it be referred to rules and
 
00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:30:47.909 --> 00:30:47.919 align:start position:0%
if this passes the way that i will
 
00:30:47.919 --> 00:30:49.190 align:start position:0%
if this passes the way that i will
structure

00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
structure
 
00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:54.549 --> 00:30:54.559 align:start position:0%
a statement that's the that's the term
 
00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
i'm looking for
 
00:30:58.230 --> 00:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
for this and i'll have it for you by the
 
00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
okay representative rice do you have
 
00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion uh i can
 
00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
may i speak madam chair
 
00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
yes representative lay thank you yeah i
 
00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
i i
 
00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
if we can put into the report that uh or
 
00:31:21.269 --> 00:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
into the statement
 
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
um that this might be better suited to
 
00:31:25.269 --> 00:31:25.279 align:start position:0%
be considered as part of rules
 
00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
um then i could support this uh the the
 
00:31:29.029 --> 00:31:29.039 align:start position:0%
motion here
 
00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
uh to go ahead and do that um to
 
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
recommend against future legislation but
 
00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:34.630 align:start position:0%
recommend against future legislation but
basically

00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:34.640 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
um make the argument that it it's better
 
00:31:38.789 --> 00:31:38.799 align:start position:0%
suited really in rules
 
00:31:42.789 --> 00:31:42.799 align:start position:0%
um and figure it out from there so
 
00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
and again representative graham has his
 
00:31:46.389 --> 00:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
hand up
 
00:31:48.549 --> 00:31:48.559 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative graham ah thank
 
00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
um the other reason i would say that is
 
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:52.630 align:start position:0%
um the other reason i would say that is
because

00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
the house can have its own rules if we
 
00:31:56.549 --> 00:31:56.559 align:start position:0%
put legislation in
 
00:31:59.269 --> 00:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
who knows what the senate will do but at
 
00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
least if we can get it into rules
 
00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
um the house would have a position on
 
00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
bills that
 
00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
and i i would add that if it were made a
 
00:32:14.159 --> 00:32:14.789 align:start position:0%
and i i would add that if it were made a
law

00:32:14.789 --> 00:32:14.799 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
it would take a lot longer to amend it
 
00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
than it would if it were a rule
 
00:32:23.509 --> 00:32:23.519 align:start position:0%
yes we address rules every two years
 
00:32:26.549 --> 00:32:26.559 align:start position:0%
madam chair may ask you yeah yeah i
 
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
i mean just to build up what
 
00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
representative graham is saying i mean i
 
00:32:30.389 --> 00:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
also suspect that
 
00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
in any such legislation it's quite
 
00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
likely the senate would not
 
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
go along with it so uh maybe we try
 
00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
to see about putting it into rules in
 
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
the house and we gain some experience
 
00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
from it and see whether it sort of
 
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
yields the results that
 
00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
um the sponsors i think would like to
 
00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
see from it um
 
00:32:51.509 --> 00:32:51.519 align:start position:0%
and then we would have we if it did
 
00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
yield the sort of results
 
00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
um then perhaps uh we'd be in a stronger
 
00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
position if
 
00:32:59.110 --> 00:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
in future we wanted to try to persuade
 
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
the senate to
 
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
be cooperative and go along that would
 
00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:04.720 align:start position:0%
that would strengthen the case
 
00:33:08.789 --> 00:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
so i agree with you
 
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:16.789 --> 00:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry did someone just say something
 
00:33:20.149 --> 00:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
no i'm scanning for hands here
 
00:33:25.029 --> 00:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
okay is there any further discussion
 
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
we would quick please state the motion
 
00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:28.559 align:start position:0%
for the record and
 
00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
do the roll call slowly so we can record
 
00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:32.389 align:start position:0%
do the roll call slowly so we can record
please

00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
okay it's not recommended for
 
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:51.509 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:33:51.509 --> 00:33:51.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh no nothing wrong
 
00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.110 align:start position:0%
uh no nothing wrong
yes

00:33:59.110 --> 00:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:02.389 --> 00:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
wilhelm yes
 
00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:08.720 align:start position:0%

yes wall
 
00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:25.760 align:start position:0%

00:34:44.629 --> 00:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
days please
 
00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:54.320 align:start position:0%

okay moving along to house bill 1359
 
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
again that's one regarding employment as
 
00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
a lobbyist
 
00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
remember folks you're not going to have
 
00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
future legislation second
 
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
second is it okay representative graham
 
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
graham ii and rice
 
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
made the motion correct milk
 
00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
good got it it's long distance isn't
 
00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
working too well
 
00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:57.589 --> 00:35:57.599 align:start position:0%
second call discussion on the motion
 
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:00.640 align:start position:0%
madam chair may i speak yes please thank
 
00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:01.349 align:start position:0%
madam chair may i speak yes please thank
you

00:36:01.349 --> 00:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm of two minds on this one i mean
 
00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
i don't like the section
 
00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
about the employment piece because i
 
00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
still think that there's
 
00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
i heard what representative frost said
 
00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if
 
00:36:15.349 --> 00:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
i read it quite that way but okay um
 
00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
so you know in terms of that i i have
 
00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
some some question about
 
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
the specific bill i
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
you know i i sort of see some benefit to
 
00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
maybe having at least a six month
 
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
waiting period
 
00:36:31.349 --> 00:36:31.359 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
by the same token i also wonder or i
 
00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
i try to think about am i witnessing
 
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
um problems now um and and
 
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
i'm trying i'm racking my brain i'm
 
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
trying to think if i've seen
 
00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
problems in other words that there's a
 
00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
problem um that must be solved here
 
00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh and i do hear i know the lot the
 
00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
argument would be that it increases
 
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
public trust in the legislature
 
00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
um i'm not sure how many people in the
 
00:36:59.270 --> 00:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
public follow who's a lobbyist and who's
 
00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:00.230 align:start position:0%
public follow who's a lobbyist and who's
not

00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
um so i i i think reluctantly i will go
 
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
along with a not
 
00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
for future legislation
 
00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you oh janet speaking um
 
00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
i i agree with you and i think it does
 
00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
make sense to get a little space in
 
00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
there but then i'm thinking
 
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
the term technically ends when the new
 
00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
legislature is sworn in
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
however we usually finish the bulk of
 
00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:28.720 align:start position:0%
our work
 
00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
by june in an election year and then
 
00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
the final election the general election
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
is until november there's a six month
 
00:37:38.069 --> 00:37:38.079 align:start position:0%
gap right there
 
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
and then after everyone's sworn in
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
the real work for lobbyists doesn't
 
00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
begin before
 
00:37:47.589 --> 00:37:47.599 align:start position:0%
us at least until january
 
00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
so there is a gap i guess if you want to
 
00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
stretch it that way
 
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
i think it does make sense to have some
 
00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
type of
 
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
grace period or whatever you want to
 
00:37:58.790 --> 00:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:02.069 --> 00:38:02.079 align:start position:0%
some breathing room but
 
00:38:05.349 --> 00:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
i agree with what the others have said
 
00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
does anyone else have anything else to
 
00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
did you have your hand up representative
 
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
frost before did i miss it no okay
 
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
okay a wheel shot
 
00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
i don't see any hands no okay um
 
00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
wait wait uh representative wilhelm
 
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
representative okay
 
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i'm i'm gonna
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
oppose the motion
 
00:38:41.109 --> 00:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
i i think there's
 
00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's worth
 
00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
continuing to work on this legislation i
 
00:38:47.829 --> 00:38:47.839 align:start position:0%
know the details aren't aren't exactly
 
00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
where we want them but
 
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
um you know i i find the entire
 
00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
the process by which we study these
 
00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
bills to be uh
 
00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
complicated because you can't actually
 
00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
you know if you study it
 
00:39:05.349 --> 00:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
we're not actually refining it and then
 
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
putting something new forward
 
00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
uh for you know the next
 
00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh the next session to consider so i'm
 
00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:15.270 align:start position:0%
uh the next session to consider so i'm
gonna

00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
gonna
 
00:39:18.069 --> 00:39:18.079 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna oppose the motion uh in hopes
 
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
that it it
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
continues to be worked on next year
 
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh representative graham has his hand up
 
00:39:25.829 --> 00:39:25.839 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative graham
 
00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair to paraphrase
 
00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
what you said a couple of times already
 
00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
no matter what we say or do in our
 
00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:35.670 align:start position:0%
no matter what we say or do in our
statements

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
statements
 
00:39:39.109 --> 00:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
and our recommendation any single member
 
00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
of the next a session of the general
 
00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
court can file a bill to do this
 
00:39:47.829 --> 00:39:47.839 align:start position:0%
whether it be for two years six months
 
00:39:47.839 --> 00:39:48.550 align:start position:0%
whether it be for two years six months
or

00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
no action at all and i think that that
 
00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:52.470 align:start position:0%
no action at all and i think that that
is

00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:39:55.589 --> 00:39:55.599 align:start position:0%
the entire problem with sending a bill
 
00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
to interim study
 
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
is that we don't really solve anything
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
and this year has been even worse
 
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
because we haven't been able to actually
 
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
be to do any work on them
 
00:40:10.309 --> 00:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
we usually resolve some of the problems
 
00:40:12.069 --> 00:40:12.079 align:start position:0%
that we've been discussing
 
00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
so i'm obviously going to support
 
00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
the motion but i think that we all have
 
00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
to understand that
 
00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
interim study at least this term has
 
00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
not worked the way that a lot of times
 
00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
it does where we actually get
 
00:40:31.109 --> 00:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
a lot more data to make a recommendation
 
00:40:31.119 --> 00:40:34.790 align:start position:0%
a lot more data to make a recommendation
with

00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
thank you i understand where
 
00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
representative wilhelm is coming from
 
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
and i think it
 
00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
it's it's not an issue that's going to
 
00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
go away i don't believe
 
00:40:49.829 --> 00:40:49.839 align:start position:0%
i i do believe we can expect to see a
 
00:40:49.839 --> 00:40:50.550 align:start position:0%
i i do believe we can expect to see a
bill

00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
at least one bill coming forward next
 
00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:53.670 align:start position:0%
at least one bill coming forward next
year

00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
um i will simply say in my experience
 
00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
i have only known one or two people in
 
00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
all these years who have
 
00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
gone into being lobbyists rather soon
 
00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
after stepping out of the legislature
 
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.030 align:start position:0%
after stepping out of the legislature
and

00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
all the others have had at least a two
 
00:41:13.349 --> 00:41:13.359 align:start position:0%
two and a half three year gap
 
00:41:15.829 --> 00:41:15.839 align:start position:0%
in there who have become those who have
 
00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
become lobbyists
 
00:41:19.829 --> 00:41:19.839 align:start position:0%
but that's just from my experience and
 
00:41:22.069 --> 00:41:22.079 align:start position:0%
again without any kind of law
 
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
i haven't seen a problem with those who
 
00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
did go in a little bit sooner
 
00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
as lobbyists but again i don't believe
 
00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
it's an issue that will go away i will
 
00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:36.870 align:start position:0%
it's an issue that will go away i will
support

00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
the motion because i think there even
 
00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:40.230 align:start position:0%
the motion because i think there even
though

00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
though
 
00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
it's a concept that well it's a concept
 
00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
that's going to be around for a while
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
um again the bill has been killed before
 
00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
but it may pass one of these years i'm
 
00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:53.200 align:start position:0%
going to support the
 
00:41:57.270 --> 00:41:57.280 align:start position:0%

00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:56.240 align:start position:0%

i would move uh that we not recommend
 
00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:04.319 align:start position:0%

that
 
00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
representative rice seconded
 
00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
representative lay made the motion
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
okay good enough do we have discussion
 
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
may i speak to my motion yes please too
 
00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh very simply i i just think that
 
00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
yeah this probably would be more
 
00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
effective in administrative rules
 
00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
um and it would be good to check with
 
00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's office first to
 
00:44:32.069 --> 00:44:32.079 align:start position:0%
find out where they even are on this
 
00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
um there's no point in putting something
 
00:44:36.069 --> 00:44:36.079 align:start position:0%
into statute that they're
 
00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
hopefully actually going ahead to do i
 
00:44:40.309 --> 00:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
know they are beginning to digitize more
 
00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
and more of what they do at the
 
00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office
 
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
um and um i will trust what they
 
00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
stated previously that this is something
 
00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
they were planning to do anyways
 
00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
so i think we can easily follow up and
 
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
find out whether it's happening or not
 
00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
and if not
 
00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
and there's a need for legislation then
 
00:44:59.670 --> 00:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
we could go ahead and do something
 
00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you manager uh representative
 
00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
graham has his handbook
 
00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
i agree with um representative lay on
 
00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:08.550 align:start position:0%
i agree with um representative lay on
this

00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
and the fact that the secretary of state
 
00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:12.230 align:start position:0%
and the fact that the secretary of state
is

00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
moving forward with um going digital
 
00:45:17.829 --> 00:45:17.839 align:start position:0%
but remember that that all takes money
 
00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
from us
 
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
and budget capital budget to continue to
 
00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
go forward
 
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
and until we know exactly where we are
 
00:45:26.309 --> 00:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
on that whole effort
 
00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
i'd hate to put something in the law
 
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
with with
 
00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
um hard deadlines or the rest
 
00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
um before we do that and with
 
00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
administrative rules they could get it
 
00:45:39.349 --> 00:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
done this fall
 
00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
if they're ready to go forward because
 
00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
that committee is still meeting thank
 
00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
you and i would add that we did hear
 
00:45:49.349 --> 00:45:49.359 align:start position:0%
from the deputy
 
00:45:52.309 --> 00:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
speakers excuse me deputy secretary of
 
00:45:52.319 --> 00:45:53.190 align:start position:0%
speakers excuse me deputy secretary of
state

00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
and he did say that they were moving
 
00:45:56.790 --> 00:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
forward to the best of their ability
 
00:45:59.349 --> 00:45:59.359 align:start position:0%
uh coveted 19 has certainly interfered
 
00:46:01.349 --> 00:46:01.359 align:start position:0%
with an awful lot of services
 
00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
from every department an agency
 
00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
and secretary of state's office i'm sure
 
00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
has been inundated with all kinds of
 
00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
extra work
 
00:46:13.109 --> 00:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
but i trust that the work is going on i
 
00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
i think it is worth
 
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
waiting to see and getting information
 
00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
from them this year they can very well
 
00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
report to the committee
 
00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
without having a bill they can report
 
00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
about the status
 
00:46:28.309 --> 00:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
of their work so i i agree with the
 
00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
motion that's been made that
 
00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
we're better off holding off at this
 
00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
i am not seeing any hands okay they're
 
00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
bringing on
 
00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
come to court please read the motion and
 
00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
do the roll call
 
00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
okay not recommended for further
 
00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
legislation it's promotion
 
00:46:53.589 --> 00:46:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:58.390 --> 00:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
