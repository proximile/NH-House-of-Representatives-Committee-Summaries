00:07:58.850 --> 00:07:58.860 align:start position:0%
here in the house uh I trust everybody
 
00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:00.780 align:start position:0%
had a good Memorial Day
 
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:03.300 align:start position:0%
I did walking in the parade and standing
 
00:08:05.629 --> 00:08:05.639 align:start position:0%
in the Sun and almost having a heat
 
00:08:05.639 --> 00:08:06.529 align:start position:0%
in the Sun and almost having a heat
stroke

00:08:06.529 --> 00:08:06.539 align:start position:0%
stroke
 
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
it was 90 degrees up in Haverhill oh
 
00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.270 align:start position:0%
it was 90 degrees up in Haverhill oh
and

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
yes it is really a hot one it's a corker
 
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
so just a little information about what
 
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
we got going on today
 
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
um we have uh one bill which has three
 
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
non-germain amendments so each one of
 
00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:27.240 align:start position:0%
those non-germaine amendments will have
 
00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:30.060 align:start position:0%
a separate hearing before us it's on
 
00:08:35.269 --> 00:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
Bill HB one uh 136 this is a bill which
 
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:37.740 align:start position:0%
uh has a totally different topic it's
 
00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:38.940 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the employment of
 
00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:41.580 align:start position:0%
volunteering or revoked a revoked or
 
00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:42.769 align:start position:0%
volunteering or revoked a revoked or
suspended

00:08:42.769 --> 00:08:42.779 align:start position:0%
suspended
 
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
teacher or educator and and so this is
 
00:08:48.889 --> 00:08:48.899 align:start position:0%
totally different the bills are all
 
00:08:50.449 --> 00:08:50.459 align:start position:0%
about the FAFSA
 
00:08:53.329 --> 00:08:53.339 align:start position:0%
so uh that's what we will be doing first
 
00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
we'll be walking through each one of
 
00:08:57.769 --> 00:08:57.779 align:start position:0%
those uh hearings and then following
 
00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
that we'll go into executive session and
 
00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:03.420 align:start position:0%
most likely I'm sure there will be a
 
00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:06.300 align:start position:0%
brief caucus uh prior to going into that
 
00:09:08.449 --> 00:09:08.459 align:start position:0%
we have several bills which we have to
 
00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:09.980 align:start position:0%
uh complete
 
00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:13.380 align:start position:0%
once we're done that process and I'll
 
00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
I'll introduce our subs here in a second
 
00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:18.320 align:start position:0%
uh once we're
 
00:09:22.009 --> 00:09:22.019 align:start position:0%
done that process we are going to be
 
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:25.380 align:start position:0%
looking at our retained bills and some
 
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
folks are thinking are you going to be
 
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:28.740 align:start position:0%
acting on any of those bills the answer
 
00:09:31.009 --> 00:09:31.019 align:start position:0%
is no we will not take any action on
 
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
retaining bills today we're simply
 
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
trying to identify which of those bills
 
00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:38.220 align:start position:0%
really need subcommittee work and has
 
00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
potential for moving forward and with
 
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
that we would like to try to nail it
 
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:44.580 align:start position:0%
down to where we're going to have these
 
00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:46.620 align:start position:0%
subcommittees and then the remaining
 
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
bills which we don't you know put in the
 
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee will be dealing with a
 
00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:52.620 align:start position:0%
committee of the whole later on this
 
00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:55.620 align:start position:0%
coming fall those reports have be out by
 
00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
November so we have a lot of time on the
 
00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:01.260 align:start position:0%
retain stuff so but this is not a
 
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
meeting in the afternoon where we're
 
00:10:05.449 --> 00:10:05.459 align:start position:0%
going to be actually taking action the
 
00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:07.980 align:start position:0%
other thing I will speak to in the
 
00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:10.980 align:start position:0%
afternoon as we I have several bills
 
00:10:12.769 --> 00:10:12.779 align:start position:0%
have come back to the Senate that are
 
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
requesting either that we concur
 
00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:16.980 align:start position:0%
non-concur or request committee a
 
00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:19.260 align:start position:0%
conference I always work with the whole
 
00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:20.940 align:start position:0%
Committee in trying to determine which
 
00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:22.980 align:start position:0%
direction we're going to recommend and
 
00:10:24.889 --> 00:10:24.899 align:start position:0%
so we'll be looking at those bills and I
 
00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:26.820 align:start position:0%
have side by sides and each those bills
 
00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
for committee members which will be able
 
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
to look at
 
00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:32.580 align:start position:0%
and the other item I'd like to talk
 
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
about today is where we are with our
 
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:36.540 align:start position:0%
education funding
 
00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
uh in in the state here for adequacy
 
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:42.300 align:start position:0%
quite an interesting executive session I
 
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
attended on Friday
 
00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:46.140 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to get into the nuts and
 
00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
bolts of the changes of that particular
 
00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:51.060 align:start position:0%
plan that's coming forth out of the
 
00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:52.860 align:start position:0%
Senate compared to that which we had
 
00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
presented in hp2 from the house a lot of
 
00:10:59.150 --> 00:10:59.160 align:start position:0%
real changes there so with that that's
 
00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
our docket for today how we're going to
 
00:11:04.069 --> 00:11:04.079 align:start position:0%
treat things looking at around the table
 
00:11:06.889 --> 00:11:06.899 align:start position:0%

non-germaine on 136 I'd like to open
 
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:53.720 align:start position:0%
that up uh we have a pink card here from
 
00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
representative Noble who is presenting
 
00:12:59.629 --> 00:12:59.639 align:start position:0%
that um Amendment welcome
 
00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:02.220 align:start position:0%
good morning everybody I'm Kristen Noble
 
00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:04.260 align:start position:0%
and I represent Hillsborough District 2
 
00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:06.660 align:start position:0%
the town of Bedford
 
00:13:08.889 --> 00:13:08.899 align:start position:0%
I'm bringing this amendment
 
00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:14.300 align:start position:0%
1396h forward to repeal RSA 193 colon
 
00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
26-a the FAFSA graduation requirement on
 
00:13:20.569 --> 00:13:20.579 align:start position:0%
behalf of my constituent superintendent
 
00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:22.200 align:start position:0%
Michael Fournier of the Bedford school
 
00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:24.660 align:start position:0%
district as well as many of his
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
colleagues from around the state
 
00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:28.860 align:start position:0%
the reason why this is coming up now is
 
00:13:31.009 --> 00:13:31.019 align:start position:0%
because this law will take effect on
 
00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
July 1st of this year
 
00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:35.700 align:start position:0%
for those who weren't here like myself
 
00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
let me give you some background in 2021
 
00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:41.940 align:start position:0%
as part of a senate Omnibus Bill we
 
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
passed a law that required the free
 
00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
application for financial student aid or
 
00:13:48.889 --> 00:13:48.899 align:start position:0%
FAFSA be filled out as a high school
 
00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
graduation requirement or the student
 
00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:53.820 align:start position:0%
can obtain a waiver
 
00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
the intent was that requiring everyone
 
00:13:58.129 --> 00:13:58.139 align:start position:0%
to complete the FAFSA could possibly
 
00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
reveal to some students that they could
 
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:03.720 align:start position:0%
afford College by qualifying for the
 
00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:06.660 align:start position:0%
Pell Grant loans or other financial aid
 
00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:07.980 align:start position:0%
from a school
 
00:14:09.949 --> 00:14:09.959 align:start position:0%
the thought was that this would open the
 
00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
door for many more students to earn
 
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
college degrees
 
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
when you fill out the FAFSA you must
 
00:14:19.069 --> 00:14:19.079 align:start position:0%
list at least one school that you want
 
00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:21.540 align:start position:0%
your financial information sent to
 
00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
prior to filling out the application a
 
00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
student would have already done the
 
00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:28.200 align:start position:0%
research on schools and likely already
 
00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.750 align:start position:0%
research on schools and likely already
applied

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
applied
 
00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:31.980 align:start position:0%
it's also not a complete picture of
 
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
whether a student can afford College
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
if a student can't pay for college on
 
00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
their own they'll be applying for
 
00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:40.980 align:start position:0%
scholarships and Loans in addition to
 
00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
any Aid that they might get
 
00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:46.260 align:start position:0%
so my point is if the student has the
 
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
desire to go to college then they are
 
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:51.060 align:start position:0%
filling out the FAFSA without it being
 
00:14:53.569 --> 00:14:53.579 align:start position:0%
mandated by the state
 
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
if a student doesn't already have
 
00:14:57.829 --> 00:14:57.839 align:start position:0%
college goals then they shouldn't be
 
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
mandated to fill it out
 
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:04.260 align:start position:0%
RSA 193 colon 26-a says the district
 
00:15:07.009 --> 00:15:07.019 align:start position:0%
shall provide each high school student
 
00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:09.060 align:start position:0%
or their parents support or assistance
 
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
needed to comply
 
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
high school guidance counselors in this
 
00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:16.500 align:start position:0%
state already do their very best to help
 
00:15:19.129 --> 00:15:19.139 align:start position:0%
repair college-bound students and that
 
00:15:22.129 --> 00:15:22.139 align:start position:0%
includes help with the FAFSA
 
00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:24.420 align:start position:0%
there are countless resources outside of
 
00:15:26.449 --> 00:15:26.459 align:start position:0%
school to help students and parents with
 
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
the FAFSA
 
00:15:31.189 --> 00:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
the law states that the FAFSA or waiver
 
00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:33.540 align:start position:0%
is a prerequisite to receiving a high
 
00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:34.740 align:start position:0%
school diploma
 
00:15:37.069 --> 00:15:37.079 align:start position:0%
but there's really no teeth here because
 
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
if a student has fulfilled all other
 
00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:41.820 align:start position:0%
graduation requirements then they can't
 
00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
really be stopped from graduating it
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
says the principal would have to attest
 
00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:49.620 align:start position:0%
that they made a good faith effort to
 
00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:51.660 align:start position:0%
assist the student with either the FAFSA
 
00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:52.860 align:start position:0%
or the waiver
 
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
so if the law can't be enforced is there
 
00:15:58.129 --> 00:15:58.139 align:start position:0%
really a need
 
00:16:01.129 --> 00:16:01.139 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest arguments in favor of
 
00:16:04.069 --> 00:16:04.079 align:start position:0%
Medicaid direct certification was that
 
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
districts wouldn't have the hassle of
 
00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:08.820 align:start position:0%
chasing after free and reduced lunch
 
00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:11.519 align:start position:0%
paperwork this also requires the
 
00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:13.740 align:start position:0%
districts to chase applications and
 
00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:16.620 align:start position:0%
waivers for hundreds of students
 
00:16:19.069 --> 00:16:19.079 align:start position:0%
while this requirement may work just
 
00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:21.300 align:start position:0%
fine for other states this is not the
 
00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire way it's an invasion of
 
00:16:26.329 --> 00:16:26.339 align:start position:0%
privacy it's an overstep by the state
 
00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:28.740 align:start position:0%
for both the individual and our school
 
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
districts it sends the wrong message to
 
00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:33.660 align:start position:0%
students that college is the best
 
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
pathway but for many students it's not
 
00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:38.100 align:start position:0%
and that's okay
 
00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
this is not to say the FAFSA is an
 
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
important it certainly is which is why
 
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
our districts already provide
 
00:16:47.449 --> 00:16:47.459 align:start position:0%
information to students and their
 
00:16:47.459 --> 00:16:48.769 align:start position:0%
information to students and their
families

00:16:48.769 --> 00:16:48.779 align:start position:0%
families
 
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
I know there are some that think that
 
00:16:53.569 --> 00:16:53.579 align:start position:0%
let's just wait and see how it goes but
 
00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:55.500 align:start position:0%
I trust that these superintendents know
 
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
how this will impact their districts
 
00:16:59.810 --> 00:16:59.820 align:start position:0%
they're asking for your support in
 
00:17:02.509 --> 00:17:02.519 align:start position:0%
repealing the RSA so I have a letter
 
00:17:04.669 --> 00:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
here that um several of the
 
00:17:07.909 --> 00:17:07.919 align:start position:0%
superintendents have signed
 
00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:09.540 align:start position:0%
so I'm just going to read to you the
 
00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:10.549 align:start position:0%
so I'm just going to read to you the
districts

00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:17:12.169 --> 00:17:12.179 align:start position:0%
um that signed it
 
00:17:15.289 --> 00:17:15.299 align:start position:0%

I have no idea two okay I don't know so
 
00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:26.340 align:start position:0%
that that I wasn't able to find like any

you
 
00:18:36.409 --> 00:18:36.419 align:start position:0%
thank you further question
 
00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
representative Hall

thank you and thank you for taking my
 
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
question could you read the bottom line
 
00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:43.620 align:start position:0%
sentence from the letter from the
 
00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:45.049 align:start position:0%
sentence from the letter from the
superintendents

00:18:45.049 --> 00:18:45.059 align:start position:0%
superintendents
 
00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:47.340 align:start position:0%
you know the oh I did not I didn't read
 
00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
their letter
 
00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
but is there a a sentence in that letter
 
00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:55.140 align:start position:0%
that you could read to us you know you
 
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
didn't look at it at all
 
00:18:59.210 --> 00:18:59.220 align:start position:0%
I didn't look at it at all do you have
 
00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:00.900 align:start position:0%
copies I have copies I'm going to hang
 
00:19:03.289 --> 00:19:03.299 align:start position:0%
out all right thank you okay are there
 
00:19:06.169 --> 00:19:06.179 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:19:09.409 --> 00:19:09.419 align:start position:0%
oops yes
 
00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:11.460 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair
 
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
um so in the in the nutshell what was
 
00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:17.580 align:start position:0%
the um superintendent's objection to uh
 
00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.730 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:22.740 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:25.500 align:start position:0%
it's probably best to ask them and I
 
00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:28.140 align:start position:0%
have it all in the letter uh a lot of
 
00:19:30.289 --> 00:19:30.299 align:start position:0%
what is what I mentioned it's an
 
00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
invasion of privacy
 
00:19:35.029 --> 00:19:35.039 align:start position:0%
um State shouldn't be and enforcing this
 
00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:37.380 align:start position:0%
on families
 
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
um and also it it could potentially be a
 
00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:42.660 align:start position:0%
burden on the district so follow up on
 
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
that go ahead I I I did hear you say it
 
00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.039 align:start position:0%
was an invasion of privacy I was
 
00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could be more specific
 
00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:52.020 align:start position:0%
as to why it's Invasion privacy
 
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
because they're trying to force you to
 
00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:56.700 align:start position:0%
to share your financial information
 
00:19:58.610 --> 00:19:58.620 align:start position:0%
and a follow-up on it sharing it with
 
00:19:58.620 --> 00:19:59.450 align:start position:0%
and a follow-up on it sharing it with
who

00:19:59.450 --> 00:19:59.460 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
with whom well this would be shared with
 
00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:04.380 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
and that Finance another question
 
00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799 align:start position:0%
try to get your point out yeah no thanks
 
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
thanks and that that financial
 
00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:14.580 align:start position:0%
information is information that that
 
00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
comes from internal revenue
 
00:20:19.789 --> 00:20:19.799 align:start position:0%
um right so potential which is part of
 
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
the federal government right ready so
 
00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
potentially it could also be shared with
 
00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:25.860 align:start position:0%
the school so if we're asking
 
00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:28.380 align:start position:0%
the school to help parents fill this out
 
00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
you're you're sharing your information
 
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
with them as well
 
00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:35.460 align:start position:0%
no all right and I I don't I'm what's
 
00:20:39.289 --> 00:20:39.299 align:start position:0%
very unclear to me is how do they
 
00:20:40.909 --> 00:20:40.919 align:start position:0%
how do they even know whether you filled
 
00:20:42.289 --> 00:20:42.299 align:start position:0%
it out or not because a lot of times
 
00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
this is done online
 
00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if they're if you're
 
00:20:49.669 --> 00:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:50.940 align:start position:0%
yeah I think there'll be an answer to
 
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
that coming up okay I think there will
 
00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
be a lot of answers as we have other
 
00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:56.220 align:start position:0%
people presenting here yes represent
 
00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:58.070 align:start position:0%
people presenting here yes represent

00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
Balboni
 
00:21:00.169 --> 00:21:00.179 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:21:01.789 --> 00:21:01.799 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:21:03.529 --> 00:21:03.539 align:start position:0%
um at the beginning of it you said it
 
00:21:06.289 --> 00:21:06.299 align:start position:0%
was important um because it goes into
 
00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:10.020 align:start position:0%
effect so it has I'm sorry because I
 
00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:11.700 align:start position:0%
don't know what's happened yet
 
00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:14.220 align:start position:0%
um has this gone into effect yet nope it
 
00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:16.380 align:start position:0%
was past two years ago but it goes into
 
00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:19.620 align:start position:0%
effect July 1st of this year
 
00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:22.010 align:start position:0%
effect July 1st of this year
so

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:22.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:24.049 --> 00:21:24.059 align:start position:0%
so if it hasn't gone into effect how do
 
00:21:27.049 --> 00:21:27.059 align:start position:0%
we know that there's a problem with it
 
00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:29.460 align:start position:0%
well I'm trusting that the
 
00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
superintendents can foresee the issues
 
00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:35.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:36.780 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:21:39.529 --> 00:21:39.539 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question regarding the the
 
00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
Privacy issue
 
00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:47.460 align:start position:0%
um would you agree that the IRS says
 
00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:49.140 align:start position:0%
certain standards in place for releasing
 
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
financial information generally
 
00:21:55.789 --> 00:21:55.799 align:start position:0%
yes and if I may follow up on that
 
00:21:58.210 --> 00:21:58.220 align:start position:0%
um would you then also agree that by
 
00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
sharing that information more widely
 
00:22:03.409 --> 00:22:03.419 align:start position:0%
than just the IRS the Department of
 
00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
Education it may uh contribute to more
 
00:22:10.669 --> 00:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
eyes seeing that and possibly increasing
 
00:22:15.289 --> 00:22:15.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:20.760 align:start position:0%

okay I'd like to uh welcome honorable
 
00:22:45.529 --> 00:22:45.539 align:start position:0%

welcome

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:46.980 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:53.220 align:start position:0%
I too is it a Memorial Day Parade an
 
00:22:56.890 --> 00:22:56.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:59.870 --> 00:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh recognizing me thank
 
00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
you committee for allowing me to testify
 
00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:06.470 align:start position:0%
you committee for allowing me to testify
um

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
uh some background New Hampshire
 
00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
graduates 15 000 high school students
 
00:23:15.169 --> 00:23:15.179 align:start position:0%
every year
 
00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:20.460 align:start position:0%
uh our in-state FAFSA completion rate
 
00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:23.700 align:start position:0%
currently is 50 percent
 
00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:26.220 align:start position:0%
50 percent
 
00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:28.380 align:start position:0%
uh there's a whole range and you can go
 
00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
look on the websites and find them
 
00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
there's a whole range a lot of schools a
 
00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:37.620 align:start position:0%
lot of states are at uh 80 70 60 percent
 
00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
in fact if you look at New England you
 
00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:42.780 align:start position:0%
can see who's winning the race
 
00:23:45.169 --> 00:23:45.179 align:start position:0%
and I suggest you go to the federal
 
00:23:48.649 --> 00:23:48.659 align:start position:0%
student aid site and look up
 
00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:51.500 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and look up the gis map
 
00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:54.900 align:start position:0%
and you will see all the surrounding
 
00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
states around Massachusetts
 
00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:00.780 align:start position:0%
and you can see why they're winning the
 
00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:01.930 align:start position:0%
and you can see why they're winning the
race

00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:01.940 align:start position:0%
race
 
00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:05.220 align:start position:0%
why are companies relocating there when
 
00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:07.140 align:start position:0%
the there's
 
00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:09.780 align:start position:0%
plenty of opportunity to relocate in New
 
00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire well it's because they've got
 
00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
the educated Workforce and they are
 
00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:16.740 align:start position:0%
completing FAFSA forms at 60 and 70
 
00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:18.470 align:start position:0%
completing FAFSA forms at 60 and 70
percent

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.970 align:start position:0%
percent
uh

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:19.980 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:22.740 align:start position:0%
our school districts they range all over
 
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
the place averages are averages right
 
00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:26.460 align:start position:0%
and you have some schools that are down
 
00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:28.740 align:start position:0%
to 35 percent you're going to have other
 
00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
schools that are up at 80 percent if
 
00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
you're up at 80 you won the race
 
00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:35.940 align:start position:0%
you're doing great
 
00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:38.220 align:start position:0%
if you're up at 70 you might be but
 
00:24:40.669 --> 00:24:40.679 align:start position:0%
that's only Bedford
 
00:24:40.679 --> 00:24:42.049 align:start position:0%
that's only Bedford
Lebanon

00:24:42.049 --> 00:24:42.059 align:start position:0%
Lebanon
 
00:24:42.059 --> 00:24:43.610 align:start position:0%
Lebanon
Hopkinton

00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:43.620 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton
 
00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:45.110 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton
uh

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:47.340 align:start position:0%
and Londonderry
 
00:24:50.029 --> 00:24:50.039 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:52.740 align:start position:0%
50 percent is the average in our state
 
00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:55.740 align:start position:0%
at 50 percent completion rate of FAFSA
 
00:24:59.450 --> 00:24:59.460 align:start position:0%
that means that there are 7 500 students
 
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
who are likely going to college or some
 
00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:05.340 align:start position:0%
post-secondary experience not
 
00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:07.380 align:start position:0%
necessarily a college
 
00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:08.630 align:start position:0%
necessarily a college
uh

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:25:11.149 --> 00:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
in you know among our graduates on an
 
00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:13.919 align:start position:0%
annual basis and when you then factor in
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
representative lead you can verify that
 
00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:19.860 align:start position:0%
in fact about 58 of our
 
00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:21.780 align:start position:0%
high school graduates in the state they
 
00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:23.940 align:start position:0%
wind up going out of state if they're
 
00:25:25.669 --> 00:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
going to a post-secondary education
 
00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:28.460 align:start position:0%
experience closer to 60.
 
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
and if it is 60
 
00:25:35.149 --> 00:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
that means that there are less than 3
 
00:25:36.769 --> 00:25:36.779 align:start position:0%
000 students
 
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
who are going from high school into a
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education experience in
 
00:25:44.269 --> 00:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:52.860 align:start position:0%
and you can get this data this does not
 
00:25:57.850 --> 00:25:57.860 align:start position:0%
need to be a swag kind of amendment
 
00:26:01.909 --> 00:26:01.919 align:start position:0%
in fact this should have been a bill
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
and I'm surprised that this committee is
 
00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:06.900 align:start position:0%
considering amendments on this when
 
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
there is factual data that you should be
 
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:14.700 align:start position:0%
Now put on your employer hat
 
00:26:16.549 --> 00:26:16.559 align:start position:0%
if you were to locate anywhere in the
 
00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:17.940 align:start position:0%
country where would you locate your
 
00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:19.789 align:start position:0%
country where would you locate your
business

00:26:19.789 --> 00:26:19.799 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:23.700 align:start position:0%
biotech infotech
 
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
Health Sciences
 
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
you're going to go where there's an
 
00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:35.700 align:start position:0%
this isn't a pro-education or forcing an
 
00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
education mandate kind of statute
 
00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:43.020 align:start position:0%
this is a pro business statute
 
00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:46.020 align:start position:0%
it's about aligning our education system
 
00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:49.380 align:start position:0%
with the needs of our employers and you
 
00:26:51.529 --> 00:26:51.539 align:start position:0%
know who those are
 
00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
they're in the Halls on a regular basis
 
00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:55.860 align:start position:0%
ask them
 
00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:57.720 align:start position:0%
what decides
 
00:27:00.289 --> 00:27:00.299 align:start position:0%
the expansion to a second shift in your
 
00:27:00.299 --> 00:27:01.370 align:start position:0%
the expansion to a second shift in your
Workforce

00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:01.380 align:start position:0%
Workforce
 
00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:03.860 align:start position:0%
why isn't it why is it Albany
 
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
manufacturing is down to one shift a day
 
00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:13.130 align:start position:0%
manufacturing is down to one shift a day
Workforce

00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:13.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:17.460 align:start position:0%
Casa isn't the only basis for fed is not
 
00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:20.820 align:start position:0%
just the basis for federal financial aid
 
00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:23.400 align:start position:0%
scholarships it's the basis for
 
00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
institutional Aid as well
 
00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:28.500 align:start position:0%
you can reduce the price of a college
 
00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
education by a third to a half through
 
00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:32.820 align:start position:0%
the combination of federal and
 
00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:35.340 align:start position:0%
institutional Aid that means that a
 
00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:37.380 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollar per year cost can
 
00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:38.940 align:start position:0%
be reduced to twenty five thousand
 
00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:41.400 align:start position:0%
dollars or a twenty five thousand dollar
 
00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:43.980 align:start position:0%
price could be reduced to twelve
 
00:27:45.529 --> 00:27:45.539 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and you can go on the
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
websites and you can test any college in
 
00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:50.700 align:start position:0%
the country and find out what their
 
00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
actual price is after their discounts
 
00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:57.240 align:start position:0%
and if you choose to attend a community
 
00:27:58.970 --> 00:27:58.980 align:start position:0%
college in New Hampshire you could
 
00:28:04.789 --> 00:28:04.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
a FAFSA requirement is a pro-family bill
 
00:28:12.289 --> 00:28:12.299 align:start position:0%
it lowers college debt you begin saving
 
00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
faster you begin to buy homes and you
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
can start your family
 
00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
that is a pro family bill
 
00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:23.460 align:start position:0%
the result of getting a post-secondary
 
00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
education credential makes a huge
 
00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
difference in lifetime earnings we know
 
00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:29.580 align:start position:0%
this the Community College completer
 
00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:32.120 align:start position:0%
earns 50 percent more than a high school
 
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
degree completer
 
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
a bachelor's degree completer earns 100
 
00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
percent more over their lifetime
 
00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:43.500 align:start position:0%
this is a pro worker statute
 
00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:45.900 align:start position:0%
if you're looking at this statute as the
 
00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
school administrator's burden you are
 
00:28:51.529 --> 00:28:51.539 align:start position:0%
completely missing the point
 
00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
a FAFSA requirement is pro-business it's
 
00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
pro-family and it's Pro Workforce
 
00:29:01.549 --> 00:29:01.559 align:start position:0%
and it's a pro-state revenue strategy
 
00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
and if you're basing your opinion on a
 
00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:06.260 align:start position:0%
school district that already has an 80
 
00:29:09.289 --> 00:29:09.299 align:start position:0%
FAFSA completion rate you are again
 
00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:11.820 align:start position:0%
missing the point
 
00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:14.820 align:start position:0%
this is evidence-based policy and your
 
00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:19.380 align:start position:0%
decision today should be evidence-based
 
00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
you measure what's important to you and
 
00:29:24.049 --> 00:29:24.059 align:start position:0%
the measurements are right in front of
 
00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:26.220 align:start position:0%
you if you look
 
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
if the requirement doesn't work then
 
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
change it it's exactly right
 
00:29:33.409 --> 00:29:33.419 align:start position:0%
and why was it put off until this year
 
00:29:36.529 --> 00:29:36.539 align:start position:0%
it was put off because
 
00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:38.460 align:start position:0%
the federal government is simplifying
 
00:29:40.549 --> 00:29:40.559 align:start position:0%
the form you don't need to reveal family
 
00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:43.700 align:start position:0%
income it will come from the IRS
 
00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:47.340 align:start position:0%
it'll be verified that way
 
00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
the waiver is in place because families
 
00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
may not want to disclose it
 
00:29:54.889 --> 00:29:54.899 align:start position:0%
and the Department of Education has done
 
00:29:58.730 --> 00:29:58.740 align:start position:0%
what it was by Statute asked to do it
 
00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:01.500 align:start position:0%
has developed a single form for all
 
00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
districts in the state to use as the
 
00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
waiver for their families
 
00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
so I think you lack the evidence to make
 
00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
the changes that are proposed today
 
00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:16.380 align:start position:0%
and I hope that the committee will allow
 
00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:19.860 align:start position:0%
this statute to be put into effect there
 
00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
are a lot of strategies that have been
 
00:30:23.289 --> 00:30:23.299 align:start position:0%
worked on
 
00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:26.580 align:start position:0%
by multiple parties in the state to
 
00:30:28.389 --> 00:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
implement this statute
 
00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
and it's ready to roll in this next
 
00:30:33.889 --> 00:30:33.899 align:start position:0%
school year thank you for the
 
00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:35.820 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify thank you very
 
00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:38.460 align:start position:0%
much representative McDonald thank you
 
00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
and good morning
 
00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:43.020 align:start position:0%
if this statute does not go into effect
 
00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
until July 1st of this year so it has
 
00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:47.820 align:start position:0%
not gone into effect yet then how can
 
00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:50.100 align:start position:0%
you be so confident that increasing the
 
00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
number of students that fill out the
 
00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:53.340 align:start position:0%
form would increase the number of
 
00:30:54.889 --> 00:30:54.899 align:start position:0%
students picking New Hampshire over
 
00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:56.460 align:start position:0%
another state
 
00:30:58.789 --> 00:30:58.799 align:start position:0%
thanks for asking that question uh
 
00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
because it is been shown in Louisiana
 
00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
and Alabama in Illinois
 
00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:09.480 align:start position:0%
states that have implemented this act
 
00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
very similar almost exact uh
 
00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
and they can show the evidence Louisiana
 
00:31:21.769 --> 00:31:21.779 align:start position:0%
after implementing this over the last
 
00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:23.340 align:start position:0%
three years
 
00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:31.980 align:start position:0%
represent Myler
 
00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:31:35.029 --> 00:31:35.039 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:37.620 align:start position:0%
could you explain what's on the form
 
00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
right could you explain what's on the
 
00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.510 align:start position:0%
right could you explain what's on the
form

00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
form
 
00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
uh well it is under revision
 
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
so the form that
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
I filled out for my kids uh
 
00:31:56.169 --> 00:31:56.179 align:start position:0%
was about 90 questions
 
00:32:01.909 --> 00:32:01.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:04.559 align:start position:0%
well somebody helped me Senator
 
00:32:04.559 --> 00:32:05.990 align:start position:0%
well somebody helped me Senator
Alexander

00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
Alexander
 
00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:10.220 align:start position:0%
uh Lamar Alexander uh it drove him crazy
 
00:32:15.529 --> 00:32:15.539 align:start position:0%
it was his final act as a U.S senator to
 
00:32:18.409 --> 00:32:18.419 align:start position:0%
thin down the form and he forced it
 
00:32:23.149 --> 00:32:23.159 align:start position:0%
through in December of 2020.
 
00:32:27.889 --> 00:32:27.899 align:start position:0%
and that is now going into effect
 
00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:29.580 align:start position:0%
July 1.
 
00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:32.120 align:start position:0%
so as students in this next school year
 
00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:35.940 align:start position:0%
fill out the form it will be a thin down
 
00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
25 question that was their goal get to a
 
00:32:42.769 --> 00:32:42.779 align:start position:0%
25 question form and the reason it can
 
00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
be thinned down is because they've got
 
00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:48.740 align:start position:0%
access to IRS records and
 
00:32:53.389 --> 00:32:53.399 align:start position:0%
that was the whole idea of why to make
 
00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:56.220 align:start position:0%
the implementation date to coincide with
 
00:32:58.610 --> 00:32:58.620 align:start position:0%
the federal the the federal government's
 
00:33:02.269 --> 00:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
implementation of the send down form
 
00:33:02.279 --> 00:33:03.970 align:start position:0%
implementation of the send down form
foreign

00:33:03.970 --> 00:33:03.980 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:33:06.769 --> 00:33:06.779 align:start position:0%
then I'll jump to some of the others um
 
00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
I recall when you introduced this
 
00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
Senator honorable Jay Khan to the
 
00:33:15.049 --> 00:33:15.059 align:start position:0%
committee here uh one of the questions
 
00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:17.519 align:start position:0%
uh we all had I think at that point in
 
00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:20.700 align:start position:0%
time everybody believed that the intent
 
00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:23.820 align:start position:0%
the overall is laudable that students be
 
00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
familiar there's a FAFSA available
 
00:33:30.889 --> 00:33:30.899 align:start position:0%
the issue which drew a lot of attention
 
00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:34.980 align:start position:0%
and a concern was the requirement that
 
00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:37.140 align:start position:0%
if you want to graduate from high school
 
00:33:40.149 --> 00:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
you shall that's the way it came to us
 
00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:42.500 align:start position:0%
complete the FAFSA
 
00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
it was modified so now if a
 
00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
superintendent chases down or a
 
00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:49.380 align:start position:0%
principal chases down
 
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh an individual that there could be an
 
00:33:56.149 --> 00:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
exception made have you heard from
 
00:33:57.649 --> 00:33:57.659 align:start position:0%
either of those states that you talk
 
00:33:59.690 --> 00:33:59.700 align:start position:0%
about Louisiana or Alabama
 
00:34:02.269 --> 00:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
are there any students that are not
 
00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:04.980 align:start position:0%
filling out that FAFSA
 
00:34:08.089 --> 00:34:08.099 align:start position:0%
that are being held back not graduating
 
00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
even though they may have completed all
 
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
the requirements of an opportunity for
 
00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:13.020 align:start position:0%
an adequate education
 
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh they're they're not graduating have
 
00:34:17.629 --> 00:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
you heard of any of that occurring
 
00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
because they have that requirement in
 
00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
their law
 
00:34:24.889 --> 00:34:24.899 align:start position:0%
I have not and and when the bill came to
 
00:34:28.369 --> 00:34:28.379 align:start position:0%
this committee uh it had all three of
 
00:34:30.169 --> 00:34:30.179 align:start position:0%
the options
 
00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:32.220 align:start position:0%
and that's the way that it's implemented
 
00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:35.700 align:start position:0%
in law uh in in statute currently the
 
00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:42.169 --> 00:34:42.179 align:start position:0%
option two is that the student or the
 
00:34:42.179 --> 00:34:43.030 align:start position:0%
option two is that the student or the
family

00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
family
 
00:34:45.829 --> 00:34:45.839 align:start position:0%
indicates that the information has been
 
00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
shared with them uh and choose not to
 
00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:51.839 align:start position:0%
complete the FAFSA and option three is
 
00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
that the principal verifies that an
 
00:34:55.810 --> 00:34:55.820 align:start position:0%
attempt to
 
00:34:59.030 --> 00:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
notify the student the family of the
 
00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:01.740 align:start position:0%
FAFSA completion requirement has been
 
00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:05.820 align:start position:0%
made and uh and and the person has not
 
00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:08.150 align:start position:0%
made and uh and and the person has not
uh

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:11.220 align:start position:0%
complied but but the principal can sign
 
00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
off that that good faith effort was made
 
00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:17.940 align:start position:0%
those three components are exactly what
 
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
is in those other
 
00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
what's been implemented in those other
 
00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:23.450 align:start position:0%
what's been implemented in those other
states

00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:23.460 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
uh so and and I'm not familiar with that
 
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
that instance and Mr chairman what I saw
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
in your bill introduced this last year
 
00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:36.300 align:start position:0%
with the requirements for a high school
 
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
or for a student
 
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
education in the state is financial
 
00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
literacy and I I appreciated your
 
00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
steering that through into statute
 
00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
the biggest decision that a college
 
00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
student is making I'm sorry that a high
 
00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
school student is making is whether
 
00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:00.060 align:start position:0%
they're going to invest in their
 
00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:02.220 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education that's their
 
00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
biggest financial decision they are
 
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
going to make
 
00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:08.460 align:start position:0%
this is going to be part of that
 
00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
implementation and
 
00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
of our education goals for all of our
 
00:36:17.210 --> 00:36:17.220 align:start position:0%
students in the state and it is entirely
 
00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
consistent with that effort
 
00:36:21.290 --> 00:36:21.300 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:24.060 align:start position:0%
representative and then representative
 
00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:26.220 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair thank you
 
00:36:27.770 --> 00:36:27.780 align:start position:0%
very much Senator Khan for uh for
 
00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:29.460 align:start position:0%
joining us this morning
 
00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:30.050 align:start position:0%
joining us this morning
um

00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:30.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:31.380 align:start position:0%
I I
 
00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:32.109 align:start position:0%
I I
um

00:36:32.109 --> 00:36:32.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
among other things I'm I chair The
 
00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:37.140 align:start position:0%
Advisory board over at nhti so I've got
 
00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:38.820 align:start position:0%
a lot of familiarity with New
 
00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:41.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's community colleges and and I
 
00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
think um uh a lot of
 
00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
um families
 
00:36:50.569 --> 00:36:50.579 align:start position:0%
um people families across the state
 
00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
um recognize and they they certainly
 
00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:55.140 align:start position:0%
hear this in the media read this you
 
00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:55.849 align:start position:0%
hear this in the media read this you
know

00:36:55.849 --> 00:36:55.859 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:36:58.910 --> 00:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
um on online reports and and everywhere
 
00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:01.260 align:start position:0%
else that New Hampshire's Community
 
00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:04.380 align:start position:0%
College tuition is among the highest in
 
00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
the country and I guess I'm wondering
 
00:37:13.849 --> 00:37:13.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:16.020 align:start position:0%
under that you know with that is the
 
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
backdrop that New Hampshire's community
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
colleges have some of the highest
 
00:37:21.829 --> 00:37:21.839 align:start position:0%
tuition in the country how would they
 
00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:25.140 align:start position:0%
know if um if they qualified to attend
 
00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:27.540 align:start position:0%
uh Community College at virtually no
 
00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:29.329 align:start position:0%
uh Community College at virtually no
cost

00:37:29.329 --> 00:37:29.339 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
they have to complete a
 
00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:35.820 align:start position:0%
federal financial aid application which
 
00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:38.940 align:start position:0%
is the FAFSA form okay thanks thanks for
 
00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for answering my
 
00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:45.410 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for answering my
question

00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:45.420 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:46.740 align:start position:0%
um you had said
 
00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:48.839 align:start position:0%
to the answer to Rhett McDonald's
 
00:37:54.349 --> 00:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
question 80 is that 80 of the students
 
00:37:58.370 --> 00:37:58.380 align:start position:0%
are now staying in their state
 
00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
which was her question
 
00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:04.640 align:start position:0%
or is that 80 are filling out the FAFSA
 
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
if that was your question representative
 
00:38:10.609 --> 00:38:10.619 align:start position:0%
McDonald I sorry I did not that's not
 
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
what I answered I answered a question of
 
00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:18.900 align:start position:0%
uh what was the FAFSA completion rate in
 
00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:19.750 align:start position:0%
uh what was the FAFSA completion rate in
Louisiana

00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
Louisiana
 
00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:24.060 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know what percent is staying
 
00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:26.630 align:start position:0%
in the state
uh

00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:30.900 align:start position:0%
I I I don't know that sorry what I do
 
00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:34.200 align:start position:0%
know is that Louisiana's rate was around
 
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
50 percent
 
00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
prior to the implementation of their
 
00:38:41.210 --> 00:38:41.220 align:start position:0%
statute and uh and and they they just
 
00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:42.680 align:start position:0%
they they
 
00:38:46.069 --> 00:38:46.079 align:start position:0%
did a great job of implementing this and
 
00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:49.020 align:start position:0%
uh and then they're at 80 percent New
 
00:38:52.970 --> 00:38:52.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is in the lower half of our 50
 
00:38:56.329 --> 00:38:56.339 align:start position:0%
states at 50 thank you
 
00:38:58.910 --> 00:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
represent uh dry you hit your hand up
 
00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:00.780 align:start position:0%
first thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:04.020 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh when we raise
 
00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:07.020 align:start position:0%
the compulsory age of Education to 18 we
 
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden had a great graduation
 
00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:11.180 align:start position:0%
rate from our schools so I think
 
00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
requiring the FAFSA is going to
 
00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:16.740 align:start position:0%
artificially inflate our numbers of at
 
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
FAFSA completions and I'm like
 
00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:21.780 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald trying to
 
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
correlate filling out a form and your
 
00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:27.720 align:start position:0%
end game which you presented today which
 
00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
was an educated Workforce that's filling
 
00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
lots of shifts and I'm having trouble
 
00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
getting from this point to this point
 
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
can you help me yeah
 
00:39:39.109 --> 00:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
um I I encourage you to go to the
 
00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
federal student aid website uh it says
 
00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:45.780 align:start position:0%
very clearly there's a paragraph that
 
00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
says FAFSA completion has a high
 
00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:50.720 align:start position:0%
correlation rate to college attendance
 
00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:52.329 align:start position:0%
correlation rate to college attendance
uh

00:39:52.329 --> 00:39:52.339 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:39:56.329 --> 00:39:56.339 align:start position:0%
I agreed it might boost the numbers uh
 
00:39:59.690 --> 00:39:59.700 align:start position:0%
but it made you know the I just focus on
 
00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
the goal the goal here is
 
00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:06.680 align:start position:0%
how do we show that a post-secondary
 
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
education is Affordable and the only way
 
00:40:12.829 --> 00:40:12.839 align:start position:0%
to prove that to a family is to go
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
through the completion process
 
00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:20.220 align:start position:0%
it's no guarantee of attendance did you
 
00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:23.460 align:start position:0%
add your hand up represent cordelli
 
00:40:26.089 --> 00:40:26.099 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you uh
 
00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:27.839 align:start position:0%
for being here again
 
00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
um yeah I guess I'm I was a little
 
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
confused about the the whole race
 
00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:33.109 align:start position:0%
confused about the the whole race
concept

00:40:33.109 --> 00:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
concept
 
00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
um between New England states and other
 
00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:37.130 align:start position:0%
um between New England states and other
states

00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:37.140 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
um because a part of my problem I think
 
00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:41.210 align:start position:0%
um because a part of my problem I think
is

00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:41.220 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
um and uh representative try mentioned a
 
00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:45.050 align:start position:0%
um and uh representative try mentioned a
correlation

00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:45.060 align:start position:0%
correlation
 
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
um it seems like
 
00:40:48.109 --> 00:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
you're presenting that there's a
 
00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:51.720 align:start position:0%
correlation between companies relocating
 
00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire and FAFSA completion
 
00:40:59.870 --> 00:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
rates and I I don't see where we can
 
00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:07.380 align:start position:0%
well I think
 
00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:11.700 align:start position:0%
I think that isn't too hard a leap but
 
00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
I'll try to connect those dots as I see
 
00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:16.760 align:start position:0%
them uh
 
00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:20.240 align:start position:0%
showing that a college or a
 
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
post-secondary again there are lots of
 
00:41:25.370 --> 00:41:25.380 align:start position:0%
ways to complete a post-secondary
 
00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:28.260 align:start position:0%
education without getting a community
 
00:41:35.589 --> 00:41:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:39.829 --> 00:41:39.839 align:start position:0%
seeing that that is an affordable option
 
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh promotes education
 
00:41:46.849 --> 00:41:46.859 align:start position:0%
and and enrollment it breaks down one of
 
00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:49.380 align:start position:0%
the most insignificant the most
 
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
significant factor uh deterrent barrier
 
00:41:58.430 --> 00:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
to a post-secondary experience is cost
 
00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
we have we have made
 
00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:04.380 align:start position:0%
education Beyond High School very costly
 
00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:06.420 align:start position:0%
in our country we
 
00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:09.660 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:12.780 align:start position:0%
there are industries that are you know
 
00:42:15.589 --> 00:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
what Texas implemented it without a
 
00:42:15.599 --> 00:42:16.730 align:start position:0%
what Texas implemented it without a
statute

00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:16.740 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
they did it through their Department of
 
00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:19.550 align:start position:0%
they did it through their Department of
Education

00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
Education
 
00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:20.990 align:start position:0%
Education
uh

00:42:20.990 --> 00:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:25.140 align:start position:0%
where is Oracle relocated where has uh
 
00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:29.940 align:start position:0%
uh Tesla relocated it's in Texas their
 
00:42:31.849 --> 00:42:31.859 align:start position:0%
completion rate is one of the top three
 
00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:33.540 align:start position:0%
in the country
 
00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh I'm just trying to connect the dots
 
00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:41.640 align:start position:0%
the they have you know they're they're
 
00:42:44.650 --> 00:42:44.660 align:start position:0%
educating people in the fields that
 
00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:47.700 align:start position:0%
these companies need to hire and and
 
00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:49.400 align:start position:0%
that's where they're going
 
00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
uh Massachusetts has done
 
00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:55.160 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily well in biotech
 
00:42:57.790 --> 00:42:57.800 align:start position:0%
and it's because
 
00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:00.540 align:start position:0%
they're they've got a high College goal
 
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
rate you can just see it
 
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
and and by the way I wanted to have a
 
00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:08.700 align:start position:0%
map for you it's on the website it's in
 
00:43:11.569 --> 00:43:11.579 align:start position:0%
color and you guys know better than I
 
00:43:14.930 --> 00:43:14.940 align:start position:0%
apparently there is not a color printer
 
00:43:16.849 --> 00:43:16.859 align:start position:0%
anywhere in
 
00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:20.060 align:start position:0%
the legislative branches
 
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
so I can't get it to you but but again
 
00:43:25.730 --> 00:43:25.740 align:start position:0%
you got to look at Massachusetts and see
 
00:43:28.609 --> 00:43:28.619 align:start position:0%
the GIS mapping and and see the the
 
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
greens and blues where there's 60 to 80
 
00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:34.020 align:start position:0%
percent completion rates and then
 
00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:36.540 align:start position:0%
compare it to New Hampshire where in
 
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
Rochester it's 20 sorry representative
 
00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
grassy uh they're a bunch of schools in
 
00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
my district Gene I know I think the
 
00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:47.640 align:start position:0%
superintendent signed the letter
 
00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:51.900 align:start position:0%
apparently but uh the completion rate is
 
00:43:54.250 --> 00:43:54.260 align:start position:0%
50 percent
 
00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:00.180 align:start position:0%
it's 45 I mean we got to do better
 
00:44:03.829 --> 00:44:03.839 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you I just point out
 
00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
that um since you mentioned Texas a few
 
00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:08.220 align:start position:0%
years ago I had the opportunity to talk
 
00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
with Governor Abbott and he talked about
 
00:44:14.329 --> 00:44:14.339 align:start position:0%
five reasons five ways that
 
00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:18.060 align:start position:0%
our state could become like Texas
 
00:44:20.569 --> 00:44:20.579 align:start position:0%
um he didn't mention FAFSA percentage
 
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
number two though was right to work so I
 
00:44:26.089 --> 00:44:26.099 align:start position:0%
think I I would rather go with right to
 
00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:29.640 align:start position:0%
work than FAFSA completion rates
 
00:44:31.609 --> 00:44:31.619 align:start position:0%
another question or is that just a
 
00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:33.780 align:start position:0%
comment okay thank you very much
 
00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
representative Damon then represent
 
00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:36.589 align:start position:0%
representative Damon then represent
Belcher

00:44:36.589 --> 00:44:36.599 align:start position:0%
Belcher
 
00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:39.470 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
question

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:44:42.109 --> 00:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
so I understand the value of the FAFSA
 
00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:44.220 align:start position:0%
and could speak to personal experience
 
00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
with students who
 
00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:49.500 align:start position:0%
needed help to understand that they
 
00:44:50.829 --> 00:44:50.839 align:start position:0%
could afford to go to higher education
 
00:44:54.109 --> 00:44:54.119 align:start position:0%
what I don't understand
 
00:44:54.119 --> 00:44:55.430 align:start position:0%
what I don't understand
is

00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:44:57.290 --> 00:44:57.300 align:start position:0%
or have not been able to come up with in
 
00:44:59.630 --> 00:44:59.640 align:start position:0%
my head some way that this would be
 
00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:02.940 align:start position:0%
harmful to students or districts
 
00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:04.740 align:start position:0%
can you speak to that is there any
 
00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:12.730 --> 00:45:12.740 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
what I summarize from the letter that
 
00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:19.160 align:start position:0%
you're going to read
 
00:45:25.150 --> 00:45:25.160 align:start position:0%
is that this is another requirement
 
00:45:29.329 --> 00:45:29.339 align:start position:0%
when districts probably feel that if
 
00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:31.380 align:start position:0%
they do the right thing by their
 
00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
students they will produce the right
 
00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:35.650 align:start position:0%
students they will produce the right
outcome

00:45:35.650 --> 00:45:35.660 align:start position:0%
outcome
 
00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
without the need for a statute
 
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.230 align:start position:0%
without the need for a statute
uh

00:45:41.230 --> 00:45:41.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
we're not there and if and if we can
 
00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:48.780 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that we can get there and in
 
00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:51.660 align:start position:0%
two three years from now after this is
 
00:45:53.809 --> 00:45:53.819 align:start position:0%
implemented we see that the rate went up
 
00:45:56.210 --> 00:45:56.220 align:start position:0%
to 70 percent the systems are in place
 
00:46:00.829 --> 00:46:00.839 align:start position:0%
and this uh then then we win
 
00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:03.720 align:start position:0%
and and you can repeal the bill uh the
 
00:46:07.069 --> 00:46:07.079 align:start position:0%
statute because it it it it could be
 
00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
implemented without but we don't have
 
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
the the Department of Education uh
 
00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:18.900 align:start position:0%
Staffing that they do in Most states and
 
00:46:21.250 --> 00:46:21.260 align:start position:0%
so you're not going to see the kind of
 
00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:25.260 align:start position:0%
impetus and follow-through uh in New
 
00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:28.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh and I I it just with the
 
00:46:30.829 --> 00:46:30.839 align:start position:0%
statute in the last two years to kind of
 
00:46:33.109 --> 00:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
follow through that's happened with
 
00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
neath the New Hampshire higher education
 
00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
financial assistance entity they have
 
00:46:41.809 --> 00:46:41.819 align:start position:0%
amped up their work they're going to
 
00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
produce video segments frequently Asked
 
00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
videos specific to New Hampshire
 
00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
families and New Hampshire schools
 
00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:58.550 --> 00:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
the rollout is underway this hasn't been
 
00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
an act that has been dormant for two
 
00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:03.240 align:start position:0%
years people have been working on this
 
00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
and and in collaboration with counselors
 
00:47:09.109 --> 00:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
in the state so
 
00:47:13.490 --> 00:47:13.500 align:start position:0%
anyway I I think
 
00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
I I I think the the idea of mandates uh
 
00:47:21.470 --> 00:47:21.480 align:start position:0%
in public education are something that
 
00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:22.970 align:start position:0%
in public education are something that
uh

00:47:22.970 --> 00:47:22.980 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
folks would just assume Nazi and statute
 
00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
and just follow through and good intent
 
00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
but if that was the case we wouldn't
 
00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:33.240 align:start position:0%
have education goals would we Mr
 
00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:34.370 align:start position:0%
have education goals would we Mr
chairman

00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:34.380 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:36.200 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher
 
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:47:40.309 --> 00:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:41.880 align:start position:0%
um getting a little bit to the heart of
 
00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:45.060 align:start position:0%
the matter here I think beyond the FAFSA
 
00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
there's an underlying assumption for the
 
00:47:50.210 --> 00:47:50.220 align:start position:0%
FAFSA the universal that the universal
 
00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
attendance of of college is is good and
 
00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
wise for all people
 
00:47:58.849 --> 00:47:58.859 align:start position:0%
um however we're seeing that not only
 
00:48:01.069 --> 00:48:01.079 align:start position:0%
are a lot of people having difficulty
 
00:48:03.890 --> 00:48:03.900 align:start position:0%
repaying their college debt there are
 
00:48:05.210 --> 00:48:05.220 align:start position:0%
also a lot of people are having a hard
 
00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
time finding jobs in the fields that
 
00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:11.460 align:start position:0%
their degrees would lend towards so I I
 
00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
think that the bit of a two-parter if
 
00:48:16.190 --> 00:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't mind is is it a good idea
 
00:48:18.890 --> 00:48:18.900 align:start position:0%
for Universal College attendance among
 
00:48:21.829 --> 00:48:21.839 align:start position:0%
students and uh does the state does the
 
00:48:24.530 --> 00:48:24.540 align:start position:0%
government have any moral culpability
 
00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:27.540 align:start position:0%
for students who are now having a hard
 
00:48:29.930 --> 00:48:29.940 align:start position:0%
time paying these debts off when we're
 
00:48:34.970 --> 00:48:34.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:39.060 align:start position:0%
um so I think the goal of post-secondary
 
00:48:41.329 --> 00:48:41.339 align:start position:0%
Education ought to be an industry
 
00:48:43.370 --> 00:48:43.380 align:start position:0%
recognized credentials
 
00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:45.480 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree is a great industry
 
00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
recognized credential it did you seldom
 
00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
have to explain much more Beyond uh for
 
00:48:55.730 --> 00:48:55.740 align:start position:0%
many jobs right uh says bachelor's
 
00:48:58.010 --> 00:48:58.020 align:start position:0%
degree required right
 
00:48:58.020 --> 00:48:58.609 align:start position:0%
degree required right
um

00:48:58.609 --> 00:48:58.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:00.829 --> 00:49:00.839 align:start position:0%
but that's not the only way to get a
 
00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
industry recognized credential there are
 
00:49:06.050 --> 00:49:06.060 align:start position:0%
many ways you might even do it through
 
00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:09.960 align:start position:0%
your high school education right uh
 
00:49:12.829 --> 00:49:12.839 align:start position:0%
so no I'm not saying that every student
 
00:49:15.770 --> 00:49:15.780 align:start position:0%
is going to go I'm saying that I think
 
00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:18.540 align:start position:0%
it is well recognized that cost is a
 
00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
barrier to post-secondary uh education
 
00:49:24.530 --> 00:49:24.540 align:start position:0%
and achieving industry recognized
 
00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
credentials and that this is a a
 
00:49:31.390 --> 00:49:31.400 align:start position:0%
mechanism for
 
00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:34.500 align:start position:0%
minimizing that cost in the same way
 
00:49:38.809 --> 00:49:38.819 align:start position:0%
that it's minimizing debt we know that
 
00:49:41.150 --> 00:49:41.160 align:start position:0%
there are college students
 
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
niece knows and they have sent and
 
00:49:45.589 --> 00:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
presented to me
 
00:49:47.809 --> 00:49:47.819 align:start position:0%
that there were seven million dollars
 
00:49:49.370 --> 00:49:49.380 align:start position:0%
left on the table
 
00:49:52.370 --> 00:49:52.380 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire high school graduates
 
00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:56.220 align:start position:0%
last year who went to college or went to
 
00:49:58.490 --> 00:49:58.500 align:start position:0%
a post-secondary experience and did not
 
00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
complete a FAFSA and they were eligible
 
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
they'd know that because uh their
 
00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
colleges that they applied for Aid at
 
00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:12.440 align:start position:0%
their colleges or wherever they attended
 
00:50:15.109 --> 00:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
anyway we know that there's money being
 
00:50:17.569 --> 00:50:17.579 align:start position:0%
left on the table because people don't
 
00:50:20.210 --> 00:50:20.220 align:start position:0%
fill it out and then go
 
00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:23.000 align:start position:0%
and we know that people don't go because
 
00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
follow up if I made this very briefly I
 
00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:31.500 align:start position:0%
think we're in agreement that it's not
 
00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:33.540 align:start position:0%
universally wise for every single
 
00:50:35.569 --> 00:50:35.579 align:start position:0%
student to go to college but if that's
 
00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:37.140 align:start position:0%
the case and some of these students know
 
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
that and their parents know that and
 
00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
it's a different course why would we
 
00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:45.060 align:start position:0%
then compel them to fill this out
 
00:50:48.410 --> 00:50:48.420 align:start position:0%
um so again there are in the statute I
 
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
hope I hope everyone's taking a look at
 
00:50:53.390 --> 00:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
it there are three mechanisms for
 
00:50:55.490 --> 00:50:55.500 align:start position:0%
satisfying this requirement one is fill
 
00:50:59.390 --> 00:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
it out another is say I've been
 
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
presented with the information I
 
00:51:04.549 --> 00:51:04.559 align:start position:0%
understand it but I'm not filling it out
 
00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:06.780 align:start position:0%
and sign it and sign that
 
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
and that's fine
 
00:51:11.930 --> 00:51:11.940 align:start position:0%
you've you satisfied the requirement and
 
00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:14.940 align:start position:0%
the third way is that you didn't do one
 
00:51:18.130 --> 00:51:18.140 align:start position:0%
of the two and the principal knows that
 
00:51:22.609 --> 00:51:22.619 align:start position:0%
uh all you've been in the class you've
 
00:51:26.210 --> 00:51:26.220 align:start position:0%
had the information presented to you uh
 
00:51:28.370 --> 00:51:28.380 align:start position:0%
sorry you didn't fill it out but I'm
 
00:51:29.809 --> 00:51:29.819 align:start position:0%
checking you off anyway
 
00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
and that form has been completed by the
 
00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Education so that it's one
 
00:51:37.069 --> 00:51:37.079 align:start position:0%
form every school district in the state
 
00:51:41.210 --> 00:51:41.220 align:start position:0%
uses the same form and uh
 
00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:43.980 align:start position:0%
and it it's just held by in the students
 
00:51:47.450 --> 00:51:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:49.260 align:start position:0%
reps in the hall did you have your hand
 
00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:51.710 align:start position:0%
reps in the hall did you have your hand
up

00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:55.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:57.049 --> 00:51:57.059 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:51:58.609 --> 00:51:58.619 align:start position:0%
taking my question I was just wondering
 
00:52:00.829 --> 00:52:00.839 align:start position:0%
how this applies to homeschool students
 
00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
because we have a fairly large
 
00:52:05.569 --> 00:52:05.579 align:start position:0%
homeschool population in New Hampshire
 
00:52:09.130 --> 00:52:09.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:11.940 align:start position:0%
represent McDonald thank you Mr chair
 
00:52:13.849 --> 00:52:13.859 align:start position:0%
there seems to have been some confusion
 
00:52:17.089 --> 00:52:17.099 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to Repose my question I
 
00:52:18.349 --> 00:52:18.359 align:start position:0%
still am struggling to see the
 
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
correlation between FAFSA completion
 
00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
versus in-state College tuition could
 
00:52:25.849 --> 00:52:25.859 align:start position:0%
you point me in the committee to some
 
00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:28.740 align:start position:0%
statistic that says a student graduating
 
00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:30.540 align:start position:0%
from a New Hampshire High School having
 
00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:33.300 align:start position:0%
completed the FAFSA form is more likely
 
00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
to attend a New Hampshire College than a
 
00:52:37.130 --> 00:52:37.140 align:start position:0%
student who did not complete the form
 
00:52:39.970 --> 00:52:39.980 align:start position:0%
yeah I I don't think I can do that
 
00:52:45.890 --> 00:52:45.900 align:start position:0%
except to say that anif does most of the
 
00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:48.109 align:start position:0%
except to say that anif does most of the
uh

00:52:48.109 --> 00:52:48.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:52:51.970 --> 00:52:51.980 align:start position:0%
High School College nights
 
00:52:54.970 --> 00:52:54.980 align:start position:0%
and presents
 
00:52:59.950 --> 00:52:59.960 align:start position:0%
as an authoritative body they they run
 
00:53:02.329 --> 00:53:02.339 align:start position:0%
workshops for counselors in the high
 
00:53:05.690 --> 00:53:05.700 align:start position:0%
schools uh anyway they they're really an
 
00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
acknowledged source for uh the
 
00:53:10.670 --> 00:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
transition between high school and
 
00:53:12.849 --> 00:53:12.859 align:start position:0%
post-secondary experiences
 
00:53:19.970 --> 00:53:19.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:22.370 --> 00:53:22.380 align:start position:0%
as they present
 
00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:24.780 align:start position:0%
they're going to use New Hampshire
 
00:53:27.290 --> 00:53:27.300 align:start position:0%
schools as the example
 
00:53:31.490 --> 00:53:31.500 align:start position:0%
here's what the costs are if you don't
 
00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:33.720 align:start position:0%
fill out the FAFSA here's the sticker
 
00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
price if you fill out the FAFSA and you
 
00:53:39.170 --> 00:53:39.180 align:start position:0%
qualify for assistance here's how much
 
00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:41.640 align:start position:0%
that price goes down
 
00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
if you
 
00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
do that step
 
00:53:48.170 --> 00:53:48.180 align:start position:0%
here's how much institutional Aid you
 
00:53:50.450 --> 00:53:50.460 align:start position:0%
can expect to receive
 
00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
and so those examples are presented
 
00:53:54.349 --> 00:53:54.359 align:start position:0%
directly to the student
 
00:53:57.170 --> 00:53:57.180 align:start position:0%
now in the FAFSA form you may recall I
 
00:54:00.349 --> 00:54:00.359 align:start position:0%
recall you fill in at least I mean you
 
00:54:01.970 --> 00:54:01.980 align:start position:0%
can fill in one school
 
00:54:04.309 --> 00:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
and satisfy the requirement
 
00:54:04.319 --> 00:54:05.930 align:start position:0%
and satisfy the requirement
uh

00:54:05.930 --> 00:54:05.940 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:07.069 align:start position:0%
uh
but

00:54:07.069 --> 00:54:07.079 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
you can fill in five schools
 
00:54:15.109 --> 00:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
and hopefully they're filling in New
 
00:54:17.450 --> 00:54:17.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire colleges for this maybe
 
00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:21.240 align:start position:0%
they're the safety school but it does re
 
00:54:25.010 --> 00:54:25.020 align:start position:0%
then offer them what is that comparative
 
00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
cost I mean the price we always get
 
00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
mixed up in higher education what's the
 
00:54:34.730 --> 00:54:34.740 align:start position:0%
cost and what's the price the cost is a
 
00:54:36.109 --> 00:54:36.119 align:start position:0%
sticker cost
 
00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
the price is a discounted rate and you
 
00:54:42.049 --> 00:54:42.059 align:start position:0%
go on the federal uh scorecard right
 
00:54:45.290 --> 00:54:45.300 align:start position:0%
College scorecard site and and you can
 
00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:46.309 align:start position:0%
College scorecard site and and you can
find

00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
find
 
00:54:48.650 --> 00:54:48.660 align:start position:0%
here's this here's the sticker price but
 
00:54:50.809 --> 00:54:50.819 align:start position:0%
students on average at that college only
 
00:54:51.970 --> 00:54:51.980 align:start position:0%
pay this
 
00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh and that's because they filled out a
 
00:54:57.710 --> 00:54:57.720 align:start position:0%
FAFSA and they've got an Institutional
 
00:55:00.170 --> 00:55:00.180 align:start position:0%
Aid and that's how much you you know is
 
00:55:02.450 --> 00:55:02.460 align:start position:0%
the price
 
00:55:07.130 --> 00:55:07.140 align:start position:0%
the mechanisms in our state can
 
00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:10.010 align:start position:0%
the mechanisms in our state can
improve

00:55:10.010 --> 00:55:10.020 align:start position:0%
improve
 
00:55:12.109 --> 00:55:12.119 align:start position:0%
the percentage of
 
00:55:14.030 --> 00:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
high school graduates
 
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
staying in state to attend school
 
00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:18.730 align:start position:0%
staying in state to attend school
but

00:55:18.730 --> 00:55:18.740 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:55:22.370 --> 00:55:22.380 align:start position:0%
even our in-state costs are high yes
 
00:55:26.690 --> 00:55:26.700 align:start position:0%
yes and uh and we've got to make efforts
 
00:55:28.730 --> 00:55:28.740 align:start position:0%
to to demonstrate
 
00:55:32.589 --> 00:55:32.599 align:start position:0%
that access is still a possibility
 
00:55:35.809 --> 00:55:35.819 align:start position:0%
without incurring huge amounts of debt
 
00:55:38.329 --> 00:55:38.339 align:start position:0%
if I may follow up please yep
 
00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:40.980 align:start position:0%
so I understand from what you are saying
 
00:55:43.609 --> 00:55:43.619 align:start position:0%
and evidence from neef that there may be
 
00:55:45.530 --> 00:55:45.540 align:start position:0%
reason to believe a correlation exists
 
00:55:47.569 --> 00:55:47.579 align:start position:0%
between FAFSA completion and their
 
00:55:49.069 --> 00:55:49.079 align:start position:0%
likelihood of a student to pick an
 
00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:51.480 align:start position:0%
in-state college but from what I
 
00:55:53.329 --> 00:55:53.339 align:start position:0%
understand is it true that there is not
 
00:55:55.790 --> 00:55:55.800 align:start position:0%
evidence of this time to suggest that we
 
00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
can guarantee a correlation exists
 
00:55:59.809 --> 00:55:59.819 align:start position:0%
between FAFSA completion and in-state
 
00:55:59.819 --> 00:56:02.170 align:start position:0%
between FAFSA completion and in-state
tuition

00:56:02.170 --> 00:56:02.180 align:start position:0%
tuition
 
00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:03.770 align:start position:0%
tuition
foreign

00:56:03.770 --> 00:56:03.780 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:56:06.890 --> 00:56:06.900 align:start position:0%
there's just a correlation between facet
 
00:56:10.970 --> 00:56:10.980 align:start position:0%
completion and college or post-secondary
 
00:56:13.790 --> 00:56:13.800 align:start position:0%
attendance okay that correlation is
 
00:56:15.109 --> 00:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
established and the federal government
 
00:56:17.329 --> 00:56:17.339 align:start position:0%
has it on their website but in state New
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire versus out of state that's a
 
00:56:21.109 --> 00:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
speculative correlation at least at this
 
00:56:23.210 --> 00:56:23.220 align:start position:0%
moment in time I can't make that
 
00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
correlation only that we are we have the
 
00:56:30.109 --> 00:56:30.119 align:start position:0%
highest percent of our students
 
00:56:32.030 --> 00:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
that go on to college
 
00:56:35.329 --> 00:56:35.339 align:start position:0%
attending out of state of any state in
 
00:56:36.530 --> 00:56:36.540 align:start position:0%
the country
 
00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:38.510 align:start position:0%
the country
uh

00:56:38.510 --> 00:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
we know that too thank you
 
00:56:42.770 --> 00:56:42.780 align:start position:0%
I have a question there's a little
 
00:56:44.809 --> 00:56:44.819 align:start position:0%
follow-up as a trustee with the
 
00:56:46.309 --> 00:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
university system New Hampshire we
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
struggle all the time why they are doing
 
00:56:49.970 --> 00:56:49.980 align:start position:0%
that one of which is of course we know
 
00:56:52.609 --> 00:56:52.619 align:start position:0%
our tuitions if we're not top it's right
 
00:56:56.270 --> 00:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
below UVM then uh but I have two two
 
00:56:58.309 --> 00:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
issues here and two questions or one
 
00:57:00.650 --> 00:57:00.660 align:start position:0%
question there appears to be an
 
00:57:03.170 --> 00:57:03.180 align:start position:0%
assumption several assumptions within
 
00:57:06.829 --> 00:57:06.839 align:start position:0%
this this process we have in place one
 
00:57:06.839 --> 00:57:08.450 align:start position:0%
this this process we have in place one
that

00:57:08.450 --> 00:57:08.460 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:57:10.490 --> 00:57:10.500 align:start position:0%
this whole process is not taking place
 
00:57:12.589 --> 00:57:12.599 align:start position:0%
right now that our local school boards
 
00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
and superintendents and principals are
 
00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:15.970 align:start position:0%
and superintendents and principals are
not

00:57:15.970 --> 00:57:15.980 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:57:19.549 --> 00:57:19.559 align:start position:0%
establishing a process in which to
 
00:57:21.950 --> 00:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
encourage students to look at this
 
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
whether it be the granite guarantee loan
 
00:57:25.910 --> 00:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
or whether it be FAFSA
 
00:57:28.309 --> 00:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
through our counseling processes there's
 
00:57:30.650 --> 00:57:30.660 align:start position:0%
an assumption that may not be working or
 
00:57:32.569 --> 00:57:32.579 align:start position:0%
is not working the way you should the
 
00:57:36.109 --> 00:57:36.119 align:start position:0%
other assumption I see is that that it
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
parallels a little bit of the first one
 
00:57:39.650 --> 00:57:39.660 align:start position:0%
with our local control
 
00:57:43.010 --> 00:57:43.020 align:start position:0%
that that the state has a better way of
 
00:57:45.109 --> 00:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
telling these students this is what
 
00:57:46.809 --> 00:57:46.819 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to do
 
00:57:50.030 --> 00:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
uh and some students may say I've passed
 
00:57:51.530 --> 00:57:51.540 align:start position:0%
the ask lab I'm going off in the
 
00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:53.880 align:start position:0%
military or they may say hey I've got
 
00:57:55.609 --> 00:57:55.619 align:start position:0%
that industry recognized credential
 
00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
already through the Career Technical
 
00:57:59.450 --> 00:57:59.460 align:start position:0%
education center so why am I filling
 
00:58:01.370 --> 00:58:01.380 align:start position:0%
this I have no desire I'm going to go
 
00:58:03.950 --> 00:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
off become an electricians because why
 
00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
while you read it in the Wall Street
 
00:58:07.609 --> 00:58:07.619 align:start position:0%
Journal every day just about recently
 
00:58:10.670 --> 00:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
there's a decline in students going to
 
00:58:14.089 --> 00:58:14.099 align:start position:0%
college and why while the skill that
 
00:58:15.890 --> 00:58:15.900 align:start position:0%
they're attaining in the school whether
 
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
even being high school and CTE is going
 
00:58:20.210 --> 00:58:20.220 align:start position:0%
to net them a better income than coming
 
00:58:22.010 --> 00:58:22.020 align:start position:0%
out with a degree in political science
 
00:58:23.210 --> 00:58:23.220 align:start position:0%
or history
 
00:58:25.370 --> 00:58:25.380 align:start position:0%
so I I think there's some assumptions
 
00:58:27.290 --> 00:58:27.300 align:start position:0%
here that I I just have never been able
 
00:58:29.930 --> 00:58:29.940 align:start position:0%
to get my hand on why we feel we can do
 
00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
better than local control which I feel
 
00:58:33.650 --> 00:58:33.660 align:start position:0%
is already doing this
 
00:58:35.329 --> 00:58:35.339 align:start position:0%
can you help me out with that a little
 
00:58:35.339 --> 00:58:36.770 align:start position:0%
can you help me out with that a little
bit

00:58:36.770 --> 00:58:36.780 align:start position:0%
bit
 
00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:38.210 align:start position:0%
bit
um

00:58:38.210 --> 00:58:38.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:43.549 --> 00:58:43.559 align:start position:0%
so you it's being done and it we can't
 
00:58:46.190 --> 00:58:46.200 align:start position:0%
say that through this mechanism the
 
00:58:49.730 --> 00:58:49.740 align:start position:0%
state is putting a high value on
 
00:58:52.069 --> 00:58:52.079 align:start position:0%
trying to inform
 
00:58:54.470 --> 00:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
students and families of the
 
00:58:56.690 --> 00:58:56.700 align:start position:0%
opportunities that exist for them
 
00:58:59.930 --> 00:58:59.940 align:start position:0%
that's what we're saying as a state uh
 
00:59:02.089 --> 00:59:02.099 align:start position:0%
with with that statute
 
00:59:06.349 --> 00:59:06.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:09.109 --> 00:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
schools the the counselor
 
00:59:13.130 --> 00:59:13.140 align:start position:0%
the student to counselor ratio we know
 
00:59:17.210 --> 00:59:17.220 align:start position:0%
uh in in schools varies dramatically
 
00:59:19.609 --> 00:59:19.619 align:start position:0%
some schools are able to spend more time
 
00:59:21.170 --> 00:59:21.180 align:start position:0%
with their students
 
00:59:24.289 --> 00:59:24.299 align:start position:0%
in planning their
 
00:59:28.010 --> 00:59:28.020 align:start position:0%
education to Career guidance than other
 
00:59:28.020 --> 00:59:29.650 align:start position:0%
education to Career guidance than other
districts

00:59:29.650 --> 00:59:29.660 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:31.690 align:start position:0%
districts
and

00:59:31.690 --> 00:59:31.700 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:33.370 align:start position:0%
and
apparently

00:59:33.370 --> 00:59:33.380 align:start position:0%
apparently
 
00:59:37.730 --> 00:59:37.740 align:start position:0%
it's you can see what those I bet there
 
00:59:40.849 --> 00:59:40.859 align:start position:0%
there's another high correlation
 
00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
if you've got a high student a counselor
 
00:59:46.309 --> 00:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
ratio in your school district chances
 
00:59:48.530 --> 00:59:48.540 align:start position:0%
are you're not spending as much time on
 
00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:55.190 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:59:55.190 --> 00:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:58.130 --> 00:59:58.140 align:start position:0%
so I you know I I
 
01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
that that's the uh I mean the evidence
 
01:00:02.030 --> 01:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
is there
 
01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
there are so many districts that are 50
 
01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:06.660 align:start position:0%
and less and less in our state I mean
 
01:00:09.470 --> 01:00:09.480 align:start position:0%
how do you get to an average of 50 you
 
01:00:11.569 --> 01:00:11.579 align:start position:0%
got a bunch of schools a few schools
 
01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
that are over and a whole bunch of them
 
01:00:14.569 --> 01:00:14.579 align:start position:0%
there are less
 
01:00:17.150 --> 01:00:17.160 align:start position:0%
uh and that's just not representative of
 
01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:19.430 align:start position:0%
uh and that's just not representative of
of

01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
of of
 
01:00:25.069 --> 01:00:25.079 align:start position:0%
where the jobs are going to go in the
 
01:00:25.079 --> 01:00:25.910 align:start position:0%
where the jobs are going to go in the
future

01:00:25.910 --> 01:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
future
 
01:00:28.430 --> 01:00:28.440 align:start position:0%
and as a past principal and
 
01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:30.349 align:start position:0%
and as a past principal and
administrator

01:00:30.349 --> 01:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
01:00:34.370 --> 01:00:34.380 align:start position:0%
the top goal was always the student
 
01:00:36.770 --> 01:00:36.780 align:start position:0%
and ensuring that the student is going
 
01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:39.980 align:start position:0%
off to a Workforce career pathway that's
 
01:00:42.049 --> 01:00:42.059 align:start position:0%
where the student is really thought
 
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
about and been given support by our
 
01:00:47.089 --> 01:00:47.099 align:start position:0%
staff and parents my concern is there's
 
01:00:49.130 --> 01:00:49.140 align:start position:0%
22 superintendents here now who are
 
01:00:51.650 --> 01:00:51.660 align:start position:0%
saying that this process is probably
 
01:00:53.809 --> 01:00:53.819 align:start position:0%
already happening in my school why do I
 
01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
need the state now to mandate this under
 
01:01:01.609 --> 01:01:01.619 align:start position:0%
the the threat of withholding graduation
 
01:01:04.970 --> 01:01:04.980 align:start position:0%
door number one is completed door number
 
01:01:09.109 --> 01:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
two is is uh just I had the instruction
 
01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:11.640 align:start position:0%
I it's part of my financial literacy
 
01:01:13.609 --> 01:01:13.619 align:start position:0%
requirement and I signed off that I've
 
01:01:15.530 --> 01:01:15.540 align:start position:0%
had it and I and I'm not filling it out
 
01:01:17.569 --> 01:01:17.579 align:start position:0%
that's door number two and door number
 
01:01:19.549 --> 01:01:19.559 align:start position:0%
three is the safety net the principal
 
01:01:20.990 --> 01:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
can say
 
01:01:23.690 --> 01:01:23.700 align:start position:0%
we've made everything the students had
 
01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
that opportunity to complete it uh and
 
01:01:31.630 --> 01:01:31.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:34.849 --> 01:01:34.859 align:start position:0%
it's not a heavy stiff requirement
 
01:01:37.010 --> 01:01:37.020 align:start position:0%
because we've got a lot more
 
01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:39.540 align:start position:0%
requirements in statute that are a lot
 
01:01:41.690 --> 01:01:41.700 align:start position:0%
stiffer than this
 
01:01:43.010 --> 01:01:43.020 align:start position:0%
thank you are there further questions
 
01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
represent luno
 
01:01:47.390 --> 01:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and so so

Jay I I I I recall
 
01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
attending uh ncsl higher education
 
01:01:56.690 --> 01:01:56.700 align:start position:0%
um uh work group
 
01:01:58.970 --> 01:01:58.980 align:start position:0%
um meeting with you several years ago
 
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
four or five years ago and this it was
 
01:02:04.250 --> 01:02:04.260 align:start position:0%
the first time that that this had really
 
01:02:08.329 --> 01:02:08.339 align:start position:0%
um uh hit my radar screen and uh and I
 
01:02:10.069 --> 01:02:10.079 align:start position:0%
remember you speaking quite passionately
 
01:02:13.130 --> 01:02:13.140 align:start position:0%
about it at that um at that meeting in
 
01:02:15.650 --> 01:02:15.660 align:start position:0%
fact we were sitting at I think a table
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
during lunch with um with uh some
 
01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:21.720 align:start position:0%
senators from uh from Louisiana who were
 
01:02:25.549 --> 01:02:25.559 align:start position:0%
telling us how successful this um this
 
01:02:28.490 --> 01:02:28.500 align:start position:0%
program uh has been in their state and
 
01:02:30.589 --> 01:02:30.599 align:start position:0%
and the the line of question the most
 
01:02:33.230 --> 01:02:33.240 align:start position:0%
recent line of questioning here sort of
 
01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
reminded me of not just that um uh that
 
01:02:41.210 --> 01:02:41.220 align:start position:0%
meeting at ncsl but also meetings that
 
01:02:43.250 --> 01:02:43.260 align:start position:0%
we've had here and people that have
 
01:02:46.970 --> 01:02:46.980 align:start position:0%
joined us in committee for for similar
 
01:02:49.370 --> 01:02:49.380 align:start position:0%
related bills and how much of this
 
01:02:52.329 --> 01:02:52.339 align:start position:0%
effort is not actually being
 
01:02:56.030 --> 01:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
generated locally but generated through
 
01:02:57.890 --> 01:02:57.900 align:start position:0%
Partnerships with
 
01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
um with neef as you've mentioned but
 
01:03:04.069 --> 01:03:04.079 align:start position:0%
also with you know Trio programs like
 
01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
education Talent search Upward Bound I
 
01:03:07.690 --> 01:03:07.700 align:start position:0%

Hampshire charitable foundation and I
 
01:03:12.829 --> 01:03:12.839 align:start position:0%
was wondering if you could talk a little
 
01:03:16.430 --> 01:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
bit about how the current statute which
 
01:03:19.609 --> 01:03:19.619 align:start position:0%
comes into effect on July 1st leverages
 
01:03:19.619 --> 01:03:21.470 align:start position:0%
comes into effect on July 1st leverages
those

01:03:21.470 --> 01:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:03:24.349 --> 01:03:24.359 align:start position:0%
um you know third-party uh initiatives
 
01:03:28.190 --> 01:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
in supporting our Public Schools thanks

the table to to help
 
01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
talk about what's the kind of training
 
01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:49.200 align:start position:0%

frequently asked questions are there uh
 
01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
you mentioned it New Hampshire
 
01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
charitable Foundation has come up with
 
01:04:08.450 --> 01:04:08.460 align:start position:0%
its strategy for uh paying for one

course to college
 
01:04:13.370 --> 01:04:13.380 align:start position:0%

college-based federally funded uh are
 
01:04:28.970 --> 01:04:28.980 align:start position:0%
instrumental in this and so are the
 
01:04:32.210 --> 01:04:32.220 align:start position:0%
states colleges the 22 College financial
 
01:04:35.930 --> 01:04:35.940 align:start position:0%
aid officers a part of the overall

planning and they too participate in the
 
01:04:42.170 --> 01:04:42.180 align:start position:0%
school workshops that take place so yes
 
01:04:46.210 --> 01:04:46.220 align:start position:0%
it has amped up the collaborations

between all of those parties thank you
 
01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:53.400 align:start position:0%
now let's just remind the committee and
 
01:04:55.730 --> 01:04:55.740 align:start position:0%
I'll take the questions from several
 
01:04:58.490 --> 01:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
more people but uh we've spent an hour
 
01:05:02.329 --> 01:05:02.339 align:start position:0%
on the first primarily with uh Senator
 
01:05:03.549 --> 01:05:03.559 align:start position:0%
Khan here
 
01:05:06.410 --> 01:05:06.420 align:start position:0%
we have several other folks are here to
 
01:05:08.569 --> 01:05:08.579 align:start position:0%
speak on this bill right now several
 
01:05:08.579 --> 01:05:10.309 align:start position:0%
speak on this bill right now several
superintendents

01:05:10.309 --> 01:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
superintendents
 
01:05:12.410 --> 01:05:12.420 align:start position:0%
um and then we have two others which are
 
01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
coming up afterwards so I know we're
 
01:05:17.690 --> 01:05:17.700 align:start position:0%
getting what this pretty much taken care
 
01:05:19.690 --> 01:05:19.700 align:start position:0%
of in the first
 
01:05:22.730 --> 01:05:22.740 align:start position:0%
non-germaine men here but uh let's let's
 
01:05:24.109 --> 01:05:24.119 align:start position:0%
limit the number of questions we have
 
01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
left I know representative electus you

01:05:48.170 --> 01:05:48.180 align:start position:0%
um okay let's representative
 
01:05:50.210 --> 01:05:50.220 align:start position:0%
so I just want to make sure I'm
 
01:05:52.609 --> 01:05:52.619 align:start position:0%
understanding the FAFSA
 
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
so if I'm a family and my goal is to
 
01:05:57.289 --> 01:05:57.299 align:start position:0%
find out
 
01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
I have to name a college and that
 
01:06:07.490 --> 01:06:07.500 align:start position:0%
college will be getting my personal
 
01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:09.289 align:start position:0%
college will be getting my personal
information

01:06:09.289 --> 01:06:09.299 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:06:14.030 --> 01:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:16.670 --> 01:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:25.789 --> 01:06:25.799 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for
 
01:06:28.069 --> 01:06:28.079 align:start position:0%
Senator Khan
 
01:06:30.049 --> 01:06:30.059 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you Mr
 
01:06:30.059 --> 01:06:31.609 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you Mr
chairman

01:06:31.609 --> 01:06:31.619 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:06:33.710 --> 01:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
okay I'd like to call forward Brian
 
01:06:40.010 --> 01:06:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:42.349 --> 01:06:42.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
see I think you're both on this letter
 
01:06:46.130 --> 01:06:46.140 align:start position:0%
here and you're probably both come come
 
01:06:49.069 --> 01:06:49.079 align:start position:0%
from the similar angles uh so and we
 
01:06:50.829 --> 01:06:50.839 align:start position:0%
rode together
 
01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
makes sense we're happy to do this
 
01:06:56.089 --> 01:06:56.099 align:start position:0%
together okay so once you introduce
 
01:06:57.770 --> 01:06:57.780 align:start position:0%
yourselves and
 
01:06:59.630 --> 01:06:59.640 align:start position:0%
we'll get on with it sure
 
01:07:00.770 --> 01:07:00.780 align:start position:0%
um I'm Brian Mulkey I'm the
 
01:07:02.270 --> 01:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
superintendent of schools in Goffstown
 
01:07:04.309 --> 01:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
in New Boston uh Mike Fournier
 
01:07:05.690 --> 01:07:05.700 align:start position:0%
superintendent schools for the Bedford
 
01:07:07.069 --> 01:07:07.079 align:start position:0%
school district
 
01:07:09.650 --> 01:07:09.660 align:start position:0%
so I think um I'll I'll start and then
 
01:07:12.289 --> 01:07:12.299 align:start position:0%
I'll hand it off to Mr Fournier I just
 
01:07:14.029 --> 01:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
um I agree with everything that Senator
 
01:07:16.250 --> 01:07:16.260 align:start position:0%
Khan said I I think that he makes a lot
 
01:07:18.049 --> 01:07:18.059 align:start position:0%
of compelling points
 
01:07:20.270 --> 01:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
um I support families filling out the
 
01:07:23.270 --> 01:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
FAFSA I have two College age kids both
 
01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
of my kids go to the University of New
 
01:07:26.450 --> 01:07:26.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm paying
 
01:07:28.970 --> 01:07:28.980 align:start position:0%
um the highest uh in-state tuition in
 
01:07:30.789 --> 01:07:30.799 align:start position:0%
the entire country I believe
 
01:07:33.950 --> 01:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
so I am a supporter of kids going on to
 
01:07:35.870 --> 01:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
school I'm a supporter of kids having
 
01:07:39.170 --> 01:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
multiple options my issue with this is
 
01:07:42.410 --> 01:07:42.420 align:start position:0%
don't put schools in a position where
 
01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
we're going to refuse giving someone a
 
01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:45.839 align:start position:0%
high school diploma because of a
 
01:07:47.870 --> 01:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
decision that their parents made that's
 
01:07:50.569 --> 01:07:50.579 align:start position:0%
my whole singular argument I support
 
01:07:53.809 --> 01:07:53.819 align:start position:0%
fastest being done I support an educated
 
01:07:56.450 --> 01:07:56.460 align:start position:0%
Workforce I support people considering
 
01:07:58.309 --> 01:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
all of the options including higher ed
 
01:08:00.349 --> 01:08:00.359 align:start position:0%
just don't put high school principals
 
01:08:02.390 --> 01:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
and superintendents in a position where
 
01:08:05.029 --> 01:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
I'm going to withhold someone's diploma
 
01:08:07.549 --> 01:08:07.559 align:start position:0%
because they didn't fill out a form or
 
01:08:10.130 --> 01:08:10.140 align:start position:0%
I'm going to fill out forms and say well
 
01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
I'm going to fill one out a waiver for
 
01:08:13.490 --> 01:08:13.500 align:start position:0%
everybody and it's going to water down
 
01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
the the effect of what you're hoping to
 
01:08:17.329 --> 01:08:17.339 align:start position:0%
have um occur
 
01:08:19.490 --> 01:08:19.500 align:start position:0%
uh great thank you uh again Mike
 
01:08:21.110 --> 01:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
Fournier superintendent of Bedford thank
 
01:08:22.970 --> 01:08:22.980 align:start position:0%
you for uh having me here I've actually
 
01:08:24.590 --> 01:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
never spoke to a body in the legislature
 
01:08:26.930 --> 01:08:26.940 align:start position:0%
before so this is a first for me uh we
 
01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:28.380 align:start position:0%
have a lot to do in our day jobs we
 
01:08:30.110 --> 01:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
don't often get out
 
01:08:32.749 --> 01:08:32.759 align:start position:0%
um so essentially uh Brian and I have
 
01:08:34.370 --> 01:08:34.380 align:start position:0%
not talked about this in depth but I
 
01:08:36.169 --> 01:08:36.179 align:start position:0%
agree with what he said in my linchpin
 
01:08:38.450 --> 01:08:38.460 align:start position:0%
uh on this issue is is really singular
 
01:08:42.829 --> 01:08:42.839 align:start position:0%
as well uh is that we are tying a
 
01:08:45.709 --> 01:08:45.719 align:start position:0%
parental duty to a student's graduation
 
01:08:48.050 --> 01:08:48.060 align:start position:0%
and in Bedford at least when a student
 
01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
graduates from high school it is based
 
01:08:52.910 --> 01:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
on what they know and are able to do it
 
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
is not based on what they know and what
 
01:08:57.110 --> 01:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
their parents can do and so when you
 
01:08:59.209 --> 01:08:59.219 align:start position:0%
graduate from Bedford High School you
 
01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
not your parents can do Algebra you can
 
01:09:04.130 --> 01:09:04.140 align:start position:0%
write you can read it is not what your
 
01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
parents can do and so this ties a
 
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
student's graduation to what their
 
01:09:11.749 --> 01:09:11.759 align:start position:0%
parents elect to do or not to do so
 
01:09:13.729 --> 01:09:13.739 align:start position:0%
that's sort of the first piece the
 
01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
second is and you all know this we're
 
01:09:17.269 --> 01:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
sort of in this environment where
 
01:09:19.070 --> 01:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
there's a fair amount of tension between
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
families and schools already and as
 
01:09:23.930 --> 01:09:23.940 align:start position:0%
Brian can attest there are a number of
 
01:09:25.370 --> 01:09:25.380 align:start position:0%
requirements that school districts have
 
01:09:27.530 --> 01:09:27.540 align:start position:0%
that we that we do and we're happy to do
 
01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
them this is one that in my opinion and
 
01:09:32.930 --> 01:09:32.940 align:start position:0%
in the opinion of my five board members
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
is an overreach and an overstep while I
 
01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
do conceptually agree with most of what
 
01:09:42.550 --> 01:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
Senator Khan shared
 
01:09:45.189 --> 01:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
I certainly do not make the connection
 
01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:48.060 align:start position:0%
between a Better Business environment
 
01:09:50.709 --> 01:09:50.719 align:start position:0%
and filling out FAFSA
 
01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
nor am I going to compare New
 
01:09:55.970 --> 01:09:55.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's high quality education to
 
01:09:58.430 --> 01:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
that of Mississippi or Louisiana
 
01:10:01.010 --> 01:10:01.020 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not sure an arbitrary 80
 
01:10:02.870 --> 01:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
percent uh I don't know what it's going
 
01:10:06.229 --> 01:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
to get us however I will say for both of
 
01:10:09.290 --> 01:10:09.300 align:start position:0%
our communities we spend a significant
 
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
amount of time through Naviance in
 
01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
Bedford through meetings with nice
 
01:10:17.330 --> 01:10:17.340 align:start position:0%
through parent meetings working with
 
01:10:19.250 --> 01:10:19.260 align:start position:0%
families to make sure they understand
 
01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
the options that are available to them
 
01:10:24.410 --> 01:10:24.420 align:start position:0%
so that they understand what is before
 
01:10:26.030 --> 01:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
them so when they go out off to college
 
01:10:28.189 --> 01:10:28.199 align:start position:0%
so I have three I have three kids of my
 
01:10:30.110 --> 01:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
own two of which have graduated from
 
01:10:31.970 --> 01:10:31.980 align:start position:0%
college and one who is currently
 
01:10:34.250 --> 01:10:34.260 align:start position:0%
attending proudly UNH
 
01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:34.910 align:start position:0%
attending proudly UNH
um

01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:38.930 --> 01:10:38.940 align:start position:0%
and so you know I can
 
01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
arbit not arbitrarily I can say I think
 
01:10:44.930 --> 01:10:44.940 align:start position:0%
with some um certainty that one of the
 
01:10:46.729 --> 01:10:46.739 align:start position:0%
reasons why many New Hampshire students
 
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
don't go to school in New Hampshire is
 
01:10:50.209 --> 01:10:50.219 align:start position:0%
because it's too expensive
 
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
um I will say out of the 15 colleges
 
01:10:55.310 --> 01:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
that all of the 15 colleges my three
 
01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
kids applied to every single one of
 
01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:00.420 align:start position:0%
those colleges required FAFSA in order
 
01:11:03.290 --> 01:11:03.300 align:start position:0%
for them to receive scholarships so the
 
01:11:05.090 --> 01:11:05.100 align:start position:0%
school district didn't require it but
 
01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
the college did and so as they were
 
01:11:09.410 --> 01:11:09.420 align:start position:0%
attending college in order to apply for
 
01:11:11.390 --> 01:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
scholarships they had to fill out the
 
01:11:13.610 --> 01:11:13.620 align:start position:0%
Federal Form and so from our point of
 
01:11:15.709 --> 01:11:15.719 align:start position:0%
view this is not an administrative
 
01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
burden that we're looking to avoid it's
 
01:11:21.470 --> 01:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
really linking a parent's job to that of
 
01:11:24.709 --> 01:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
a student and adding an additional layer
 
01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
of possible tension and conflict between
 
01:11:27.890 --> 01:11:27.900 align:start position:0%
parents and schools that really don't
 
01:11:30.050 --> 01:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
belong there it's a family decision not
 
01:11:32.930 --> 01:11:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:35.649 --> 01:11:35.659 align:start position:0%
further questions representative Tanner
 
01:11:38.810 --> 01:11:38.820 align:start position:0%
thank you um I taught high school for a
 
01:11:39.890 --> 01:11:39.900 align:start position:0%
long time
 
01:11:43.130 --> 01:11:43.140 align:start position:0%
had an opportunity to talk to a lot of
 
01:11:44.570 --> 01:11:44.580 align:start position:0%
kids particularly in their Junior and
 
01:11:46.729 --> 01:11:46.739 align:start position:0%
Senior year about where they're going I
 
01:11:49.430 --> 01:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
I still uh when I go to the store and
 
01:11:51.410 --> 01:11:51.420 align:start position:0%
there's a kid bagging I say you know
 
01:11:53.930 --> 01:11:53.940 align:start position:0%
what's your plans right that's a
 
01:11:56.689 --> 01:11:56.699 align:start position:0%
teacher's job I noticed in the letter as
 
01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
I'm just kind of zipping down it here
 
01:12:01.130 --> 01:12:01.140 align:start position:0%
there's one statement that's made it it
 
01:12:03.470 --> 01:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
says that the mandate's unnecessary
 
01:12:05.810 --> 01:12:05.820 align:start position:0%
because families are already aware of
 
01:12:08.630 --> 01:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
the benefits of completing the FAFSA and
 
01:12:10.729 --> 01:12:10.739 align:start position:0%
many do so voluntarily
 
01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:14.340 align:start position:0%
that wasn't my experience that there
 
01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
were students I felt had the ability and
 
01:12:20.630 --> 01:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
had the interest to go to college but we
 
01:12:22.310 --> 01:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
were told constantly by their family
 
01:12:24.050 --> 01:12:24.060 align:start position:0%
that they just didn't have the money and
 
01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
that it would be a tremendous burden on
 
01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:28.020 align:start position:0%
them and that they should go and bag
 
01:12:30.350 --> 01:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
groceries at Hannaford's for a while and
 
01:12:33.290 --> 01:12:33.300 align:start position:0%
maybe get enough money to go to
 
01:12:36.290 --> 01:12:36.300 align:start position:0%
to take a class at the local Community
 
01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:37.850 align:start position:0%
to take a class at the local Community
College

01:12:37.850 --> 01:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
College
 
01:12:40.370 --> 01:12:40.380 align:start position:0%
um and they were afraid of FAFSA because
 
01:12:42.169 --> 01:12:42.179 align:start position:0%
a lot of the information that's out
 
01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
there and when you talk about the
 
01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:44.270 align:start position:0%
there and when you talk about the
tension

01:12:44.270 --> 01:12:44.280 align:start position:0%
tension
 
01:12:46.490 --> 01:12:46.500 align:start position:0%
was that it was a government overreach
 
01:12:48.050 --> 01:12:48.060 align:start position:0%
and that it was the government going to
 
01:12:50.450 --> 01:12:50.460 align:start position:0%
find out about their income and blah
 
01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah
 
01:12:55.790 --> 01:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
um but I'd just like to to say how are
 
01:12:58.550 --> 01:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
you sure or how and both of you are
 
01:13:01.130 --> 01:13:01.140 align:start position:0%
coming from great school districts uh
 
01:13:02.930 --> 01:13:02.940 align:start position:0%
and we know some of the school districts
 
01:13:05.450 --> 01:13:05.460 align:start position:0%
are really struggling in New Hampshire I
 
01:13:08.689 --> 01:13:08.699 align:start position:0%
represent Sunapee so you know it and I
 
01:13:10.370 --> 01:13:10.380 align:start position:0%
taught at cures Arch so those are two
 
01:13:13.490 --> 01:13:13.500 align:start position:0%
big districts that really push guidance
 
01:13:15.890 --> 01:13:15.900 align:start position:0%
counseling and mentoring kids in their
 
01:13:17.090 --> 01:13:17.100 align:start position:0%
Junior and Senior year what they're
 
01:13:19.729 --> 01:13:19.739 align:start position:0%
going to do afterwards but how how can
 
01:13:22.610 --> 01:13:22.620 align:start position:0%
we be sure that all families are aware
 
01:13:24.890 --> 01:13:24.900 align:start position:0%
of the benefits of completing the FAFSA
 
01:13:27.229 --> 01:13:27.239 align:start position:0%
the ones that aren't already voluntarily
 
01:13:29.870 --> 01:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
doing it and pushing their kids towards
 
01:13:31.729 --> 01:13:31.739 align:start position:0%
you know making sure they have some
 
01:13:33.830 --> 01:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
direction after school
 
01:13:35.630 --> 01:13:35.640 align:start position:0%
that's a great question thank you for
 
01:13:37.850 --> 01:13:37.860 align:start position:0%
asking it um I don't know if I'm allowed
 
01:13:39.950 --> 01:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
to speak how freely I can speak there's
 
01:13:42.890 --> 01:13:42.900 align:start position:0%
three amendments I believe uh one of
 
01:13:46.430 --> 01:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
them I think is so so the other piece I
 
01:13:47.930 --> 01:13:47.940 align:start position:0%
think this body it's important for you
 
01:13:50.090 --> 01:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
to hear is the superintendents
 
01:13:52.850 --> 01:13:52.860 align:start position:0%
Association when we spoke to them there
 
01:13:56.149 --> 01:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
was not there's not an outcry to Simply
 
01:13:59.330 --> 01:13:59.340 align:start position:0%
remove it like this is a terrible thing
 
01:14:02.209 --> 01:14:02.219 align:start position:0%
that has happened every superintendent
 
01:14:04.370 --> 01:14:04.380 align:start position:0%
on this letter believes in filling out
 
01:14:06.290 --> 01:14:06.300 align:start position:0%
that form and providing opportunity to
 
01:14:08.930 --> 01:14:08.940 align:start position:0%
students the issue that they have is
 
01:14:10.550 --> 01:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
making it a requirement for graduation
 
01:14:12.350 --> 01:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
But to answer your question more
 
01:14:14.630 --> 01:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
directly is I believe one of the
 
01:14:17.270 --> 01:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
Amendments sort of um
 
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
outlines what many school districts do
 
01:14:22.610 --> 01:14:22.620 align:start position:0%
of which Goffstown and Bedford are one
 
01:14:25.669 --> 01:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
which is provide parent Knights provide
 
01:14:26.990 --> 01:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
parents and students with all the
 
01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
information necessary meet with guidance
 
01:14:32.450 --> 01:14:32.460 align:start position:0%
counselors bring in neef so that when
 
01:14:34.790 --> 01:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
students are working our students as
 
01:14:36.709 --> 01:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
freshmen meet with their advisors and
 
01:14:38.090 --> 01:14:38.100 align:start position:0%
their counselors and start talking about
 
01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
the college process and have these
 
01:14:42.649 --> 01:14:42.659 align:start position:0%
conversations early and often so that by
 
01:14:44.149 --> 01:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
the time they get to their Junior and
 
01:14:47.030 --> 01:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
Senior year they're in full swing and
 
01:14:49.550 --> 01:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
ready to go and so the amendment that
 
01:14:50.810 --> 01:14:50.820 align:start position:0%
was brought forth I Believe by you
 
01:14:53.810 --> 01:14:53.820 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd I think would be
 
01:14:56.270 --> 01:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
very appropriate because it actually
 
01:14:58.189 --> 01:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
makes a requirement for school districts
 
01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
to do those things which I think are
 
01:15:02.209 --> 01:15:02.219 align:start position:0%
needed and appropriate but it stops
 
01:15:05.270 --> 01:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
short of of putting in a requirement
 
01:15:07.189 --> 01:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
it is my sense I don't know if you agree
 
01:15:11.930 --> 01:15:11.940 align:start position:0%
or disagree Brian yeah can you call sure
 
01:15:14.689 --> 01:15:14.699 align:start position:0%
so um at one point I taught a
 
01:15:17.630 --> 01:15:17.640 align:start position:0%
Cooperative class that was that was
 
01:15:19.010 --> 01:15:19.020 align:start position:0%
um you know underwritten by the federal
 
01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
government as a pilot program and it was
 
01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:24.780 align:start position:0%
targeted at students who were
 
01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:25.570 align:start position:0%
targeted at students who were
um

01:15:25.570 --> 01:15:25.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:28.189 --> 01:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
BC students but had a lot of potential
 
01:15:30.290 --> 01:15:30.300 align:start position:0%
that that teachers realized had a lot of
 
01:15:33.290 --> 01:15:33.300 align:start position:0%
potential and for the most part that
 
01:15:35.510 --> 01:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
their parents had not gone to college or
 
01:15:39.410 --> 01:15:39.420 align:start position:0%
had even not graduated from high school
 
01:15:41.390 --> 01:15:41.400 align:start position:0%
we took a trip
 
01:15:43.430 --> 01:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
first of all those parents don't show up
 
01:15:47.330 --> 01:15:47.340 align:start position:0%
to the FAFSA uh requirement or FAFSA you
 
01:15:49.490 --> 01:15:49.500 align:start position:0%
know the college nights and and all that
 
01:15:52.130 --> 01:15:52.140 align:start position:0%
stuff we went down to
 
01:15:53.630 --> 01:15:53.640 align:start position:0%
um a college
 
01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
um and I'm trying to think of the name
 
01:15:57.169 --> 01:15:57.179 align:start position:0%
of it it was down in I believe Nashua
 
01:15:59.570 --> 01:15:59.580 align:start position:0%
and it was it was actually a college
 
01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
that was set up like Notre Dame or
 
01:16:05.030 --> 01:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
something like that that was set up in a
 
01:16:08.930 --> 01:16:08.940 align:start position:0%
former department store okay and the
 
01:16:10.550 --> 01:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
reason we were there was one of the
 
01:16:11.990 --> 01:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
students very interested in going into
 
01:16:13.729 --> 01:16:13.739 align:start position:0%
physical therapy and I knew one of the
 
01:16:15.649 --> 01:16:15.659 align:start position:0%
people that was uh adjunct or a
 
01:16:17.689 --> 01:16:17.699 align:start position:0%
professor down there and it was you know
 
01:16:19.970 --> 01:16:19.980 align:start position:0%
it was it was great I mean it just it
 
01:16:22.310 --> 01:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
didn't look like Dartmouth obviously but
 
01:16:25.250 --> 01:16:25.260 align:start position:0%
it you know it was a college and and uh
 
01:16:28.729 --> 01:16:28.739 align:start position:0%
working all at the time and um
 
01:16:31.790 --> 01:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
when we got back this this young gal who
 
01:16:34.729 --> 01:16:34.739 align:start position:0%
was really wanted to do that
 
01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
um both her parents uh were first
 
01:16:39.590 --> 01:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
generation uh people
 
01:16:41.570 --> 01:16:41.580 align:start position:0%
um she they neither one of them had
 
01:16:43.490 --> 01:16:43.500 align:start position:0%
graduated from high school they they
 
01:16:45.950 --> 01:16:45.960 align:start position:0%
were afraid of people that talked about
 
01:16:48.830 --> 01:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
college they were afraid of FAFSA
 
01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
um basically and and she was in a very
 
01:16:54.169 --> 01:16:54.179 align:start position:0%
big quandary how how to go about doing
 
01:16:56.330 --> 01:16:56.340 align:start position:0%
all this and it took a lot of help from
 
01:16:58.790 --> 01:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
you know like I said our school was very
 
01:17:01.010 --> 01:17:01.020 align:start position:0%
supportive and but I'm wondering if that
 
01:17:03.590 --> 01:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
same child was a student a senior over
 
01:17:06.530 --> 01:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
in another school that's close to us
 
01:17:08.330 --> 01:17:08.340 align:start position:0%
that's struggling
 
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
um whether she would be where she is now
 
01:17:13.729 --> 01:17:13.739 align:start position:0%
and she's a physical therapist
 
01:17:13.739 --> 01:17:14.930 align:start position:0%
and she's a physical therapist
so

01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:14.940 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:17:17.810 --> 01:17:17.820 align:start position:0%
I'm just I'm just wondering how you I
 
01:17:20.630 --> 01:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
think the purpose of this was not
 
01:17:22.910 --> 01:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
that you didn't have enough information
 
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
for kids whose parents want them to go
 
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
to college or kids who really kind of
 
01:17:30.850 --> 01:17:30.860 align:start position:0%
think about college and come from a
 
01:17:33.530 --> 01:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
supportive family in in that particular
 
01:17:36.410 --> 01:17:36.420 align:start position:0%
line but it was to catch those kids and
 
01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
those families that
 
01:17:43.729 --> 01:17:43.739 align:start position:0%
um need a little a little bit extra uh
 
01:17:48.110 --> 01:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
and not incentive but totally but need
 
01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:49.510 align:start position:0%
and not incentive but totally but need
um

01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:52.370 --> 01:17:52.380 align:start position:0%
need some way to see that that there's a
 
01:17:55.130 --> 01:17:55.140 align:start position:0%
pathway through to maybe the dreams that
 
01:17:57.229 --> 01:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
the kid really wants to do and money
 
01:17:59.209 --> 01:17:59.219 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be the the object and
 
01:18:02.209 --> 01:18:02.219 align:start position:0%
particularly with you know we have
 
01:18:04.490 --> 01:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
um colleges there there is ringing up
 
01:18:07.490 --> 01:18:07.500 align:start position:0%
like us and you you know that are very
 
01:18:09.890 --> 01:18:09.900 align:start position:0%
you know fairly more affordable and
 
01:18:11.390 --> 01:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
certainly the community college system
 
01:18:13.850 --> 01:18:13.860 align:start position:0%
is making a lot a lot of it more
 
01:18:16.250 --> 01:18:16.260 align:start position:0%
affordable with the you know the
 
01:18:17.930 --> 01:18:17.940 align:start position:0%
different courses they can take in high
 
01:18:20.689 --> 01:18:20.699 align:start position:0%
school and get credit for it so I'm just
 
01:18:22.850 --> 01:18:22.860 align:start position:0%
wondering do you think you're reaching
 
01:18:25.850 --> 01:18:25.860 align:start position:0%
those people and because you've said in
 
01:18:27.770 --> 01:18:27.780 align:start position:0%
the letter that you know it's it's a
 
01:18:29.450 --> 01:18:29.460 align:start position:0%
done deal it's unnecessary because we've
 
01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
reached all those do you not see that
 
01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
this would maybe open the pathway for
 
01:18:36.169 --> 01:18:36.179 align:start position:0%
more students
 
01:18:38.330 --> 01:18:38.340 align:start position:0%
um so I I can't answer that definitively
 
01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
what I can say is this makes it feel
 
01:18:44.810 --> 01:18:44.820 align:start position:0%
more like a stick and less like a carrot
 
01:18:47.570 --> 01:18:47.580 align:start position:0%
and so you know to the extent that you
 
01:18:50.030 --> 01:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
can get people to fill up FAFSA as a
 
01:18:52.370 --> 01:18:52.380 align:start position:0%
stick then maybe
 
01:18:55.490 --> 01:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
um but I think the real I think the the
 
01:18:57.590 --> 01:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
intent that we'd like to get after is
 
01:18:59.149 --> 01:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
exactly what you say because those are
 
01:19:00.830 --> 01:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
the kids that really pull on our
 
01:19:02.330 --> 01:19:02.340 align:start position:0%
heartstrings that we want to make sure
 
01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
that any student that has a desire to
 
01:19:07.250 --> 01:19:07.260 align:start position:0%
pursue higher education has all the
 
01:19:09.530 --> 01:19:09.540 align:start position:0%
options available to them and so to your
 
01:19:11.030 --> 01:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
point there are some schools that have
 
01:19:13.610 --> 01:19:13.620 align:start position:0%
more resources to do that than others
 
01:19:16.370 --> 01:19:16.380 align:start position:0%
um but whether you're a school district
 
01:19:18.290 --> 01:19:18.300 align:start position:0%
like Bedford that has resources or a
 
01:19:19.310 --> 01:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
school district that doesn't have
 
01:19:22.370 --> 01:19:22.380 align:start position:0%
resources at the end of the day this is
 
01:19:23.870 --> 01:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
going to be a checklist
 
01:19:27.290 --> 01:19:27.300 align:start position:0%
and it and it's not you know one of the
 
01:19:29.149 --> 01:19:29.159 align:start position:0%
questions was asked earlier regarding
 
01:19:31.209 --> 01:19:31.219 align:start position:0%
well what happens if a parent doesn't
 
01:19:31.219 --> 01:19:33.669 align:start position:0%
well what happens if a parent doesn't
and

01:19:33.669 --> 01:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:19:36.530 --> 01:19:36.540 align:start position:0%
superintendents will be very
 
01:19:36.540 --> 01:19:37.870 align:start position:0%
superintendents will be very
um

01:19:37.870 --> 01:19:37.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:40.430 --> 01:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
they will not be holding kids from
 
01:19:42.530 --> 01:19:42.540 align:start position:0%
graduation because of this and I don't
 
01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
know how effective it's going to be
 
01:19:45.890 --> 01:19:45.900 align:start position:0%
getting after those kids I'd like to see
 
01:19:47.930 --> 01:19:47.940 align:start position:0%
something that would come forth that's
 
01:19:49.550 --> 01:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
more of a carrot and I see
 
01:19:52.430 --> 01:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd's Amendment as more
 
01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
of a carrot for those kinds of students
 
01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
but I do appreciate the question
 
01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
represent uh Myler thank you Mr chair
 
01:20:02.930 --> 01:20:02.940 align:start position:0%
and thank you for being here and thank
 
01:20:05.390 --> 01:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
you for the work you do
 
01:20:08.330 --> 01:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
we uh we often see your representatives
 
01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
from the association here
 
01:20:12.410 --> 01:20:12.420 align:start position:0%
but we rarely have an opportunity to
 
01:20:14.570 --> 01:20:14.580 align:start position:0%
talk with people who are actually in the
 
01:20:17.209 --> 01:20:17.219 align:start position:0%
field on a daily basis working with kids
 
01:20:18.830 --> 01:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
and teachers and thank you for the work
 
01:20:22.010 --> 01:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
you're doing my question revolves around
 
01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
the waiver issue
 
01:20:26.209 --> 01:20:26.219 align:start position:0%
we've heard that there are two different
 
01:20:28.970 --> 01:20:28.980 align:start position:0%
types of waivers one for the parent one
 
01:20:31.729 --> 01:20:31.739 align:start position:0%
from the uh from a principal could you
 
01:20:34.250 --> 01:20:34.260 align:start position:0%
address that as a part of the
 
01:20:36.590 --> 01:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
conversation here thank you
 
01:20:38.590 --> 01:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
um so I think that's par I think that's
 
01:20:41.450 --> 01:20:41.460 align:start position:0%
somewhat nebulous right now
 
01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:42.290 align:start position:0%
somewhat nebulous right now
um

01:20:42.290 --> 01:20:42.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:45.649 --> 01:20:45.659 align:start position:0%
I have not yet seen the waiver or if the
 
01:20:47.630 --> 01:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
state is has established a waiver of the
 
01:20:49.430 --> 01:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
doe they may have I just haven't seen it
 
01:20:51.410 --> 01:20:51.420 align:start position:0%
yet uh of course the school would have
 
01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
to do it right now we're having
 
01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
conversations about what would that look
 
01:20:56.630 --> 01:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
like essentially it's going to be a
 
01:20:58.189 --> 01:20:58.199 align:start position:0%
checklist for us those students who have
 
01:21:01.250 --> 01:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
filled it out assigned parents think of
 
01:21:03.530 --> 01:21:03.540 align:start position:0%
a permission slip right you know that
 
01:21:06.229 --> 01:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
says I I either I've completed it yes
 
01:21:08.990 --> 01:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to complete it no and then
 
01:21:11.149 --> 01:21:11.159 align:start position:0%
of course this is actually the timing of
 
01:21:13.370 --> 01:21:13.380 align:start position:0%
this is perfect because this is the time
 
01:21:14.450 --> 01:21:14.460 align:start position:0%
where I meet with my high school
 
01:21:16.189 --> 01:21:16.199 align:start position:0%
principal and he says okay I'll say to
 
01:21:17.870 --> 01:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
him how many students are on the list
 
01:21:20.270 --> 01:21:20.280 align:start position:0%
that are that may not graduate on June
 
01:21:23.330 --> 01:21:23.340 align:start position:0%
10th in Bedford and so last week I think
 
01:21:25.550 --> 01:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
we had eight and so we go over every
 
01:21:27.290 --> 01:21:27.300 align:start position:0%
single student what is it that's missing
 
01:21:29.149 --> 01:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
that this child has missing where they
 
01:21:31.430 --> 01:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
can't graduate and so this will will add
 
01:21:34.030 --> 01:21:34.040 align:start position:0%
that we'll add this to that list
 
01:21:36.470 --> 01:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
assuming the law is in place next June
 
01:21:38.990 --> 01:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
we will do that but what that exactly
 
01:21:40.189 --> 01:21:40.199 align:start position:0%
looks like I think we're going to have
 
01:21:43.149 --> 01:21:43.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:43.159 --> 01:21:44.870 align:start position:0%
 
cardelli

01:21:44.870 --> 01:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
cardelli
 
01:21:46.970 --> 01:21:46.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you both
 
01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
for being here
 
01:21:50.930 --> 01:21:50.940 align:start position:0%
um how will you know if family has
 
01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:59.149 --> 01:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:00.890 --> 01:22:00.900 align:start position:0%
I believe from bedford's point of view
 
01:22:02.990 --> 01:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
unless we're directed otherwise by the
 
01:22:04.550 --> 01:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
department of Ed it will simply be a
 
01:22:05.810 --> 01:22:05.820 align:start position:0%
signature from a parent that they've
 
01:22:07.070 --> 01:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
done so
 
01:22:09.290 --> 01:22:09.300 align:start position:0%
but we will require no other proof than
 
01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:10.910 align:start position:0%
but we will require no other proof than
that

01:22:10.910 --> 01:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:13.729 align:start position:0%
that
representative

01:22:13.729 --> 01:22:13.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:15.530 --> 01:22:15.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:22:18.050 --> 01:22:18.060 align:start position:0%
taking my question could you please
 
01:22:21.950 --> 01:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
explain to me uh what the process is for
 
01:22:24.709 --> 01:22:24.719 align:start position:0%
a student who's going to go into the
 
01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:28.620 align:start position:0%
trades as opposed to going on to college
 
01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
and refusing the parents refusing the
 
01:22:34.850 --> 01:22:34.860 align:start position:0%
FAFSA can you explain to me what your
 
01:22:39.050 --> 01:22:39.060 align:start position:0%
process is to help that student graduate
 
01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
on time
 
01:22:42.649 --> 01:22:42.659 align:start position:0%
right so one of the things that we have
 
01:22:43.910 --> 01:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
done and I think the department of Ed
 
01:22:45.890 --> 01:22:45.900 align:start position:0%
has done with the legislator to
 
01:22:48.350 --> 01:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
legislative body too is to provide a
 
01:22:50.030 --> 01:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
number of Pathways to students
 
01:22:52.750 --> 01:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
understanding not not that not every
 
01:22:55.669 --> 01:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
Pathway to graduation is the same for
 
01:22:56.870 --> 01:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
every child
 
01:22:59.330 --> 01:22:59.340 align:start position:0%
so for example I believe the state has
 
01:23:01.430 --> 01:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
20 credits that are required for
 
01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:02.510 align:start position:0%
20 credits that are required for
graduation

01:23:02.510 --> 01:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
graduation
 
01:23:06.169 --> 01:23:06.179 align:start position:0%
Bedford has 24 but we also have a 20
 
01:23:07.790 --> 01:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
credit requirement there are some
 
01:23:09.649 --> 01:23:09.659 align:start position:0%
students that take High set because the
 
01:23:11.090 --> 01:23:11.100 align:start position:0%
traditional route is not right for them
 
01:23:14.810 --> 01:23:14.820 align:start position:0%
that's formerly GED there are students
 
01:23:18.169 --> 01:23:18.179 align:start position:0%
that have multiple Pathways there are
 
01:23:20.090 --> 01:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
some students who will come to us early
 
01:23:22.669 --> 01:23:22.679 align:start position:0%
with their families and say we're not
 
01:23:24.050 --> 01:23:24.060 align:start position:0%
going to be a traditional student for
 
01:23:26.149 --> 01:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
you and we want to move through a
 
01:23:28.430 --> 01:23:28.440 align:start position:0%
pathway differently than a typical
 
01:23:31.250 --> 01:23:31.260 align:start position:0%
student would and so our what our
 
01:23:32.990 --> 01:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
counselors do is they meet with those
 
01:23:34.490 --> 01:23:34.500 align:start position:0%
students and they talk about what are
 
01:23:36.649 --> 01:23:36.659 align:start position:0%
the options available to you and what
 
01:23:38.270 --> 01:23:38.280 align:start position:0%
are the pros and cons of those options
 
01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
right so some students will graduate
 
01:23:42.050 --> 01:23:42.060 align:start position:0%
from high school with a 24 credit degree
 
01:23:43.370 --> 01:23:43.380 align:start position:0%
and go on and help run the family
 
01:23:45.290 --> 01:23:45.300 align:start position:0%
business some will go into a military
 
01:23:47.510 --> 01:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
academy some will go to a four year some
 
01:23:49.550 --> 01:23:49.560 align:start position:0%
will go to a two-year some will take a
 
01:23:51.770 --> 01:23:51.780 align:start position:0%
gap year
 
01:23:54.050 --> 01:23:54.060 align:start position:0%
um but but as Senator Connor mentioned
 
01:23:57.050 --> 01:23:57.060 align:start position:0%
I'm a vast majority of Bedford students
 
01:23:58.450 --> 01:23:58.460 align:start position:0%
go on to college
 
01:24:01.669 --> 01:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
but so in our case the students that
 
01:24:02.930 --> 01:24:02.940 align:start position:0%
you're talking about who go into trade
 
01:24:05.090 --> 01:24:05.100 align:start position:0%
schools it's a much smaller group at
 
01:24:06.229 --> 01:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
least for us I don't know if your
 
01:24:08.030 --> 01:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
process yeah and I would say in general
 
01:24:10.790 --> 01:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
we're encouraging those kids to go on to
 
01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
trade school you're you're going to make
 
01:24:15.110 --> 01:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
as much money as an HVAC technician as
 
01:24:16.310 --> 01:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
you're going to be if you go get an
 
01:24:17.810 --> 01:24:17.820 align:start position:0%
accounting degree in a lot of places
 
01:24:20.450 --> 01:24:20.460 align:start position:0%
right now my brother's a union plumber
 
01:24:22.810 --> 01:24:22.820 align:start position:0%
in Boston he's doing just fine
 
01:24:25.970 --> 01:24:25.980 align:start position:0%
so we we really encourage kids that are
 
01:24:27.950 --> 01:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
interested in the trades
 
01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
um we want kids to have a lot of
 
01:24:30.950 --> 01:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
Pathways we want them to be able to
 
01:24:32.930 --> 01:24:32.940 align:start position:0%
follow what their dreams are what
 
01:24:35.209 --> 01:24:35.219 align:start position:0%
they're interested in and we want to do
 
01:24:37.250 --> 01:24:37.260 align:start position:0%
that for everybody what we don't want to
 
01:24:39.910 --> 01:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
do is say you didn't fill out the form
 
01:24:41.810 --> 01:24:41.820 align:start position:0%
unfortunately you're not getting your
 
01:24:44.630 --> 01:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
diploma today I'm not going to do that
 
01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
I've been a superintendent for 10 years
 
01:24:49.130 --> 01:24:49.140 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to withhold a diploma
 
01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:58.430 --> 01:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
picking this question how will when this
 
01:25:01.790 --> 01:25:01.800 align:start position:0%
goes into effect change your process
 
01:25:05.090 --> 01:25:05.100 align:start position:0%
for those kids who are going into the
 
01:25:08.870 --> 01:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
trades and making bucket loads of money
 
01:25:10.729 --> 01:25:10.739 align:start position:0%
I think we would just have to have that
 
01:25:12.350 --> 01:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
kind of sheet kind of like Mr Fournier
 
01:25:14.570 --> 01:25:14.580 align:start position:0%
was saying that I either completed the
 
01:25:16.610 --> 01:25:16.620 align:start position:0%
form or I understand that it's available
 
01:25:18.950 --> 01:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
and I'm choosing not to do it so we
 
01:25:21.649 --> 01:25:21.659 align:start position:0%
would have some kind of a form like that
 
01:25:25.130 --> 01:25:25.140 align:start position:0%
but again now now you're chasing
 
01:25:27.530 --> 01:25:27.540 align:start position:0%
hundreds of graduates did you get your
 
01:25:30.890 --> 01:25:30.900 align:start position:0%
form in did you do your it's just more
 
01:25:33.709 --> 01:25:33.719 align:start position:0%
of a burden on our local public schools
 
01:25:35.570 --> 01:25:35.580 align:start position:0%
just give the schools one more thing
 
01:25:37.689 --> 01:25:37.699 align:start position:0%
they'll take care of it they always do
 
01:25:40.010 --> 01:25:40.020 align:start position:0%
that's what this feels like it comes
 
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
with an apology
 
01:25:44.149 --> 01:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
you know I'm sorry Mrs Des Moines this
 
01:25:45.890 --> 01:25:45.900 align:start position:0%
is a requirement we have to we have to
 
01:25:48.290 --> 01:25:48.300 align:start position:0%
do it you kindly please return this to
 
01:25:50.149 --> 01:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
the school district well why do I have
 
01:25:52.370 --> 01:25:52.380 align:start position:0%
to do it and then we have to explain it
 
01:25:55.310 --> 01:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
and then there's a process and it's it
 
01:25:57.649 --> 01:25:57.659 align:start position:0%
is fine if that is what you want for
 
01:26:00.169 --> 01:26:00.179 align:start position:0%
your child and you understand it but
 
01:26:00.179 --> 01:26:01.510 align:start position:0%
your child and you understand it but
there's

01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:26:04.129 --> 01:26:04.139 align:start position:0%
if you've ever sent a permission slip
 
01:26:06.350 --> 01:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
home to 23 students and expected to get
 
01:26:08.330 --> 01:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
them all back for something they want to
 
01:26:08.340 --> 01:26:09.229 align:start position:0%
them all back for something they want to
do

01:26:09.229 --> 01:26:09.239 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:26:11.330 --> 01:26:11.340 align:start position:0%
imagine sending something home for
 
01:26:13.570 --> 01:26:13.580 align:start position:0%
something they don't want to do right
 
01:26:15.950 --> 01:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:26:17.750 --> 01:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
 
01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:18.950 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
Hall

01:26:18.950 --> 01:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
Hall
 
01:26:20.450 --> 01:26:20.460 align:start position:0%
the chair thank you for taking my
 
01:26:20.460 --> 01:26:21.410 align:start position:0%
the chair thank you for taking my
question

01:26:21.410 --> 01:26:21.420 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:26:24.410 --> 01:26:24.420 align:start position:0%
so door number three doesn't that get
 
01:26:27.229 --> 01:26:27.239 align:start position:0%
you off the hook or what you do in
 
01:26:30.110 --> 01:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
Bedford and Goffstown like you're giving
 
01:26:32.330 --> 01:26:32.340 align:start position:0%
these parent nights and whatnot so door
 
01:26:34.610 --> 01:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
three is saying you know we gave you the
 
01:26:36.229 --> 01:26:36.239 align:start position:0%
information doesn't that get you off the
 
01:26:37.610 --> 01:26:37.620 align:start position:0%
hook for every kid
 
01:26:39.709 --> 01:26:39.719 align:start position:0%
I think that it does but then it goes to
 
01:26:41.870 --> 01:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
the question what's the point of the law
 
01:26:43.490 --> 01:26:43.500 align:start position:0%
to begin with I think it's the other
 
01:26:45.110 --> 01:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
schools that maybe don't do what you're
 
01:26:48.169 --> 01:26:48.179 align:start position:0%
doing which is which is why I think
 
01:26:49.970 --> 01:26:49.980 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd's amendment is so
 
01:26:52.010 --> 01:26:52.020 align:start position:0%
appropriate because it puts the
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
requirement where it ought to be which
 
01:26:54.239 --> 01:26:54.890 align:start position:0%
requirement where it ought to be which
is

01:26:54.890 --> 01:26:54.900 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:26:57.649 --> 01:26:57.659 align:start position:0%
for for instance school districts so
 
01:27:00.110 --> 01:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
Bedford has had a a personal finance
 
01:27:01.970 --> 01:27:01.980 align:start position:0%
course for the entirety the school
 
01:27:04.250 --> 01:27:04.260 align:start position:0%
district's been open for 14 years my
 
01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
understanding is now all school
 
01:27:08.330 --> 01:27:08.340 align:start position:0%
districts are required to do that so I
 
01:27:10.669 --> 01:27:10.679 align:start position:0%
think having a requirement to make sure
 
01:27:12.890 --> 01:27:12.900 align:start position:0%
that students are aware and informed of
 
01:27:17.570 --> 01:27:17.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:20.390 --> 01:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
putting a parent's responsibility and
 
01:27:22.629 --> 01:27:22.639 align:start position:0%
tying that to a kid's graduation
 
01:27:25.129 --> 01:27:25.139 align:start position:0%
it isn't right
 
01:27:28.370 --> 01:27:28.380 align:start position:0%
graduation is what a child knows and is
 
01:27:31.010 --> 01:27:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:33.410 --> 01:27:33.420 align:start position:0%
and it should be a celebration
 
01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
01:27:38.209 --> 01:27:38.219 align:start position:0%
last last question representative
 
01:27:40.669 --> 01:27:40.679 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and thank
 
01:27:42.950 --> 01:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
you very much uh superintendent swornier
 
01:27:46.010 --> 01:27:46.020 align:start position:0%
bulky for uh being with us um this
 
01:27:47.390 --> 01:27:47.400 align:start position:0%
morning I was wondering if you could
 
01:27:49.550 --> 01:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about
 
01:27:51.649 --> 01:27:51.659 align:start position:0%
well actually let me sort of preface it
 
01:27:55.490 --> 01:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
with with um when um when when my kids
 
01:27:58.669 --> 01:27:58.679 align:start position:0%
were going through uh through school
 
01:28:00.830 --> 01:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
um K-12
 
01:28:04.970 --> 01:28:04.980 align:start position:0%
uh they they did very well and they did
 
01:28:07.610 --> 01:28:07.620 align:start position:0%
very well after graduation and and after
 
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
after college as well but um but I don't
 
01:28:15.169 --> 01:28:15.179 align:start position:0%
think it was without a lot of work on
 
01:28:17.510 --> 01:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
the part of my wife and I and our family
 
01:28:20.330 --> 01:28:20.340 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they got up on time in
 
01:28:22.729 --> 01:28:22.739 align:start position:0%
the morning made the school bus had
 
01:28:22.739 --> 01:28:24.649 align:start position:0%
the morning made the school bus had
breakfast

01:28:24.649 --> 01:28:24.659 align:start position:0%
breakfast
 
01:28:26.870 --> 01:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
um got to school on time all of that
 
01:28:29.330 --> 01:28:29.340 align:start position:0%
stuff and um you know without a little
 
01:28:31.970 --> 01:28:31.980 align:start position:0%
bit of that encouragement uh I think
 
01:28:33.649 --> 01:28:33.659 align:start position:0%
Luke might have slept in until 11
 
01:28:35.810 --> 01:28:35.820 align:start position:0%
o'clock in the morning every morning and
 
01:28:39.050 --> 01:28:39.060 align:start position:0%
and um and I'm not sure but I suspect
 
01:28:41.149 --> 01:28:41.159 align:start position:0%
that would have affected his performance
 
01:28:44.570 --> 01:28:44.580 align:start position:0%
and and and success in high school in
 
01:28:47.149 --> 01:28:47.159 align:start position:0%
particular but I was wondering if you
 
01:28:49.250 --> 01:28:49.260 align:start position:0%
could talk a little bit about you know
 
01:28:51.709 --> 01:28:51.719 align:start position:0%
those sorts of things that that how
 
01:28:55.550 --> 01:28:55.560 align:start position:0%
Student Success is related to what
 
01:28:57.350 --> 01:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
parents do whether that's feeding them
 
01:28:59.209 --> 01:28:59.219 align:start position:0%
or putting money in their pocket so that
 
01:29:02.570 --> 01:29:02.580 align:start position:0%
they can buy a school lunch or fill out
 
01:29:03.830 --> 01:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
the free and reduced price launch
 
01:29:06.169 --> 01:29:06.179 align:start position:0%
paperwork so that they're fueled up and
 
01:29:07.810 --> 01:29:07.820 align:start position:0%
ready to learn
 
01:29:11.990 --> 01:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
that day and and maybe how that reflects
 
01:29:15.649 --> 01:29:15.659 align:start position:0%
on on Bedford and Goffstown which you
 
01:29:18.590 --> 01:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
know are are as has been said are are
 
01:29:21.709 --> 01:29:21.719 align:start position:0%
tremendous very strong districts in the
 
01:29:21.719 --> 01:29:22.910 align:start position:0%
tremendous very strong districts in the
state

01:29:22.910 --> 01:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:29:26.030 --> 01:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
um and but how it reflects on your
 
01:29:29.169 --> 01:29:29.179 align:start position:0%
family's um you know their rate of of
 
01:29:32.629 --> 01:29:32.639 align:start position:0%
post-secondary degree attainment and and
 
01:29:34.310 --> 01:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
how that
 
01:29:37.250 --> 01:29:37.260 align:start position:0%
you know looks I mean is that pretty
 
01:29:39.229 --> 01:29:39.239 align:start position:0%
much standard across the state or do we
 
01:29:40.790 --> 01:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
see different things across state
 
01:29:42.590 --> 01:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
because these are Statewide policies
 
01:29:45.290 --> 01:29:45.300 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about I I would say
 
01:29:47.209 --> 01:29:47.219 align:start position:0%
certainly the challenges in Bedford and
 
01:29:49.189 --> 01:29:49.199 align:start position:0%
Goffstown look different than challenges
 
01:29:51.410 --> 01:29:51.420 align:start position:0%
in other communities in the state for
 
01:29:54.050 --> 01:29:54.060 align:start position:0%
sure but I would agree that
 
01:29:54.060 --> 01:29:54.709 align:start position:0%
sure but I would agree that
um

01:29:54.709 --> 01:29:54.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:56.870 --> 01:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
achievements that our kids have are
 
01:29:58.850 --> 01:29:58.860 align:start position:0%
reflective of their parents for sure so
 
01:30:01.790 --> 01:30:01.800 align:start position:0%
you're reluctant wake up student in the
 
01:30:05.090 --> 01:30:05.100 align:start position:0%
morning uh you getting him to school on
 
01:30:07.970 --> 01:30:07.980 align:start position:0%
time was very important for his success
 
01:30:08.990 --> 01:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
in school
 
01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:30:14.689 --> 01:30:14.699 align:start position:0%
um so if may I make a comment I agree
 
01:30:17.209 --> 01:30:17.219 align:start position:0%
with you my college kid still sleeps
 
01:30:19.790 --> 01:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
until 10 or 11 sometimes
 
01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:22.260 align:start position:0%
um so this is just something interesting
 
01:30:24.590 --> 01:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
to share so Bedford we do have our share
 
01:30:26.870 --> 01:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
of problems that this year we just
 
01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
instituted for the first time at one of
 
01:30:30.169 --> 01:30:30.179 align:start position:0%
our elementary schools a breakfast
 
01:30:33.050 --> 01:30:33.060 align:start position:0%
program it started off about a month ago
 
01:30:36.350 --> 01:30:36.360 align:start position:0%
and we started with 25 students and then
 
01:30:38.330 --> 01:30:38.340 align:start position:0%
it grew to 50 students and then I think
 
01:30:40.129 --> 01:30:40.139 align:start position:0%
the last number I heard was 75 students
 
01:30:42.169 --> 01:30:42.179 align:start position:0%
reading breakfast and the principal
 
01:30:42.179 --> 01:30:43.310 align:start position:0%
reading breakfast and the principal
reported

01:30:43.310 --> 01:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
reported
 
01:30:47.930 --> 01:30:47.940 align:start position:0%
um to us he said Mike the behavior of
 
01:30:51.169 --> 01:30:51.179 align:start position:0%
the students has improved so much since
 
01:30:53.750 --> 01:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
this program started and it's sort of a
 
01:30:55.370 --> 01:30:55.380 align:start position:0%
basic thing that kids learn when they
 
01:30:57.129 --> 01:30:57.139 align:start position:0%
have a full tummy right
 
01:30:59.330 --> 01:30:59.340 align:start position:0%
I'm sure other parents are feeding them
 
01:31:00.709 --> 01:31:00.719 align:start position:0%
at home or most of them are certainly
 
01:31:02.149 --> 01:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
and so I think as parents we do have a
 
01:31:04.790 --> 01:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
responsibility and I and for me I think
 
01:31:06.950 --> 01:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
that sort of gets to the heart of the
 
01:31:08.570 --> 01:31:08.580 align:start position:0%
matter that it is a parental
 
01:31:10.550 --> 01:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
responsibility I do think as a school
 
01:31:12.410 --> 01:31:12.420 align:start position:0%
district we have a responsibility to
 
01:31:14.930 --> 01:31:14.940 align:start position:0%
sort of open the door show them the
 
01:31:17.390 --> 01:31:17.400 align:start position:0%
options make sure the buffet is
 
01:31:19.250 --> 01:31:19.260 align:start position:0%
available so that we can explain all the
 
01:31:20.750 --> 01:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
options available to students and make
 
01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
sure the pathways are there I you know
 
01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
as I have said consistently I just think
 
01:31:26.810 --> 01:31:26.820 align:start position:0%
I'd like to
 
01:31:28.970 --> 01:31:28.980 align:start position:0%
stop short of making it a requirement
 
01:31:31.790 --> 01:31:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:33.950 --> 01:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I appreciate it
 
01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you is there anybody
 
01:31:39.169 --> 01:31:39.179 align:start position:0%
else to wants to testify on
 
01:31:41.450 --> 01:31:41.460 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
01:31:43.970 --> 01:31:43.980 align:start position:0%
not seeing any will close this hearing
 
01:31:47.149 --> 01:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
and we'll go into the next hearing which
 
01:31:50.330 --> 01:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
is also on the same 130 SB 136
 
01:31:53.689 --> 01:31:53.699 align:start position:0%
non-germaine of which I am the response

representative cordelli and I'll be out
front

01:31:59.330 --> 01:31:59.340 align:start position:0%
front
 
01:32:05.689 --> 01:32:05.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:08.870 --> 01:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank you so this is uh Amendment
 
01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:15.229 align:start position:0%
thank you so this is uh Amendment
2023-1744h

01:32:15.229 --> 01:32:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
um and uh we'll call on representative
 
01:32:21.410 --> 01:32:21.420 align:start position:0%
lad for its introduction
 
01:32:23.629 --> 01:32:23.639 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh so I'd like to
 
01:32:26.090 --> 01:32:26.100 align:start position:0%
introduce 1744.
 
01:32:27.890 --> 01:32:27.900 align:start position:0%
um there's a number of reasons why I've
 
01:32:30.470 --> 01:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
done this my past experience as the
 
01:32:32.689 --> 01:32:32.699 align:start position:0%
school principal and administrator
 
01:32:34.790 --> 01:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
um hone in a lot of what's discussed
 
01:32:37.610 --> 01:32:37.620 align:start position:0%
within this amendment but I'm also
 
01:32:40.430 --> 01:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
reflecting just as a father and as a
 
01:32:42.290 --> 01:32:42.300 align:start position:0%
grandfather I've sent my own children
 
01:32:45.410 --> 01:32:45.420 align:start position:0%
off to Texas A M to Elmira College the
 
01:32:48.110 --> 01:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
University of Idaho uh just recently
 
01:32:51.770 --> 01:32:51.780 align:start position:0%
grandkids to St Lawrence University and
 
01:32:54.050 --> 01:32:54.060 align:start position:0%
University of Maine why University of
 
01:32:56.990 --> 01:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
Maine it was cheaper than unh
 
01:32:59.810 --> 01:32:59.820 align:start position:0%
and so that's one of the reasons why
 
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
people are leaving this state but I'd
 
01:33:04.550 --> 01:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
like to talk specifically to the
 
01:33:06.890 --> 01:33:06.900 align:start position:0%
rationale behind this bill and I think
 
01:33:09.050 --> 01:33:09.060 align:start position:0%
we've talked about that the intent is
 
01:33:12.709 --> 01:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
yes I recognize the value of FAFSA
 
01:33:15.050 --> 01:33:15.060 align:start position:0%
when we first heard this bill presented
 
01:33:17.149 --> 01:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
several years back
 
01:33:19.070 --> 01:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
and it goes in effect this this coming
 
01:33:22.790 --> 01:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
July we had that bill introduced to us
 
01:33:26.090 --> 01:33:26.100 align:start position:0%
where there was a mandate there was a
 
01:33:27.950 --> 01:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
mandate you don't do this you don't
 
01:33:30.830 --> 01:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
graduate we amended that in committee
 
01:33:33.890 --> 01:33:33.900 align:start position:0%
here to allow for the provision that if
 
01:33:36.169 --> 01:33:36.179 align:start position:0%
they signed off in this form they were
 
01:33:38.390 --> 01:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
able to you know they would graduate if
 
01:33:40.490 --> 01:33:40.500 align:start position:0%
they didn't want a complete FAFSA that
 
01:33:43.729 --> 01:33:43.739 align:start position:0%
was a result of House Education
 
01:33:46.970 --> 01:33:46.980 align:start position:0%
now if you look at the amendment in
 
01:33:51.050 --> 01:33:51.060 align:start position:0%
lines 12 through 22 it explains the
 
01:33:53.270 --> 01:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
process it says
 
01:33:55.610 --> 01:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
it's every district has to be
 
01:33:58.850 --> 01:33:58.860 align:start position:0%
responsibility to ensure that students
 
01:34:03.890 --> 01:34:03.900 align:start position:0%
are provided the the FAFSA
 
01:34:07.010 --> 01:34:07.020 align:start position:0%
it also gets into the middle of that the
 
01:34:09.350 --> 01:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
discretion of the school board and the
 
01:34:11.390 --> 01:34:11.400 align:start position:0%
school to decide what they do in
 
01:34:14.450 --> 01:34:14.460 align:start position:0%
communicating with a student about their
 
01:34:16.790 --> 01:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
next step as they leave High School
 
01:34:18.410 --> 01:34:18.420 align:start position:0%
whether it's going to be community
 
01:34:19.750 --> 01:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
college system
 
01:34:21.709 --> 01:34:21.719 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education at the
 
01:34:23.930 --> 01:34:23.940 align:start position:0%
University level or college level or
 
01:34:27.350 --> 01:34:27.360 align:start position:0%
going into the trades that is that at
 
01:34:29.870 --> 01:34:29.880 align:start position:0%
the discretion of the local school to
 
01:34:31.370 --> 01:34:31.380 align:start position:0%
decide how they're going to go about
 
01:34:34.189 --> 01:34:34.199 align:start position:0%
doing that whether and there's then also
 
01:34:36.110 --> 01:34:36.120 align:start position:0%
the processes and the bottom that where
 
01:34:38.450 --> 01:34:38.460 align:start position:0%
we give some suggestions of how that may
 
01:34:40.669 --> 01:34:40.679 align:start position:0%
occur I'm just going to reflect for a
 
01:34:42.709 --> 01:34:42.719 align:start position:0%
moment of what's going on at Woodsville
 
01:34:45.410 --> 01:34:45.420 align:start position:0%
High School Woodsville High School is a
 
01:34:48.290 --> 01:34:48.300 align:start position:0%
school that does not have the resources
 
01:34:50.930 --> 01:34:50.940 align:start position:0%
they're not like a Bedford or Goffstown
 
01:34:52.910 --> 01:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
they're a smaller High School roughly
 
01:34:56.090 --> 01:34:56.100 align:start position:0%
around 250 kids they're in a district
 
01:34:58.310 --> 01:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
which is a property poor town that's
 
01:34:58.320 --> 01:34:59.649 align:start position:0%
which is a property poor town that's
Haverhill

01:34:59.649 --> 01:34:59.659 align:start position:0%
Haverhill
 
01:35:02.750 --> 01:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
and we have an outstanding program
 
01:35:05.629 --> 01:35:05.639 align:start position:0%
within that school allowing children
 
01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
students to become familiar with FAFSA
 
01:35:10.910 --> 01:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
and with their opportunities which are
 
01:35:13.790 --> 01:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
Beyond 12th grade
 
01:35:16.010 --> 01:35:16.020 align:start position:0%
each year one of the teachers happens to
 
01:35:18.050 --> 01:35:18.060 align:start position:0%
be the social studies teacher takes
 
01:35:20.629 --> 01:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
students on a field trip to Boston
 
01:35:22.490 --> 01:35:22.500 align:start position:0%
where do they go they go to Northeastern
 
01:35:24.350 --> 01:35:24.360 align:start position:0%
they go to BU they go to Wentworth they
 
01:35:26.450 --> 01:35:26.460 align:start position:0%
go to BC they go all those schools down
 
01:35:27.890 --> 01:35:27.900 align:start position:0%
there which students might be interested
 
01:35:30.350 --> 01:35:30.360 align:start position:0%
in and they challenge the students to
 
01:35:32.510 --> 01:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
look at these schools they also through
 
01:35:34.189 --> 01:35:34.199 align:start position:0%
their personal finance literacy and
 
01:35:37.610 --> 01:35:37.620 align:start position:0%
economics provide this understanding of
 
01:35:39.890 --> 01:35:39.900 align:start position:0%
the FAFSA and the need to complete it
 
01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
because there are monies available I
 
01:35:43.070 --> 01:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
just went through it as a grandfather
 
01:35:46.790 --> 01:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
with my grandson uh the one that went to
 
01:35:48.229 --> 01:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
University of Maine fortunately went on
 
01:35:50.629 --> 01:35:50.639 align:start position:0%
a full ride scholarship if you want that
 
01:35:53.510 --> 01:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
you got to get in athletics however the
 
01:35:56.149 --> 01:35:56.159 align:start position:0%
grandson he's also in athletics but
 
01:35:58.189 --> 01:35:58.199 align:start position:0%
happens to be a division three school so
 
01:36:00.590 --> 01:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
they have to do it by way of a a little
 
01:36:02.750 --> 01:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
bit off there seventy thousand dollar a
 
01:36:04.010 --> 01:36:04.020 align:start position:0%
year tuition
 
01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
and so the rest of it comes up from
 
01:36:07.970 --> 01:36:07.980 align:start position:0%
FAFSA and things such as that and we
 
01:36:09.410 --> 01:36:09.420 align:start position:0%
went through and explained that he went
 
01:36:11.390 --> 01:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
to St Johnsbury Academy much like
 
01:36:13.070 --> 01:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
Pinkerton Academy right here in New
 
01:36:15.649 --> 01:36:15.659 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at St J we have kids coming in
 
01:36:18.830 --> 01:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
from uh Littleton from Bath from
 
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
Piermont from a number of communities up
 
01:36:24.169 --> 01:36:24.179 align:start position:0%
and down that River including lime
 
01:36:26.750 --> 01:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
and at that school they have a parent
 
01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:27.649 align:start position:0%
and at that school they have a parent
evening

01:36:27.649 --> 01:36:27.659 align:start position:0%
evening
 
01:36:29.810 --> 01:36:29.820 align:start position:0%
grandparent evening whatever you adult
 
01:36:31.550 --> 01:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
wants to come in and be informed about
 
01:36:34.070 --> 01:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
FAFSA they also through their teachers
 
01:36:36.830 --> 01:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
they have advisors to these students and
 
01:36:39.410 --> 01:36:39.420 align:start position:0%
they're constantly talking my my uh
 
01:36:42.709 --> 01:36:42.719 align:start position:0%
sophomore right now uh next year has
 
01:36:44.750 --> 01:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
already been advised and we are taking a
 
01:36:47.629 --> 01:36:47.639 align:start position:0%
trip this summer down to UNC uh in
 
01:36:50.030 --> 01:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
Wilmington has a wonderful science
 
01:36:52.610 --> 01:36:52.620 align:start position:0%
program in terms of engineering related
 
01:36:54.110 --> 01:36:54.120 align:start position:0%
to Seacoast
 
01:36:57.169 --> 01:36:57.179 align:start position:0%
and it's also one of your Best Buys in
 
01:36:59.570 --> 01:36:59.580 align:start position:0%
terms of expenses and that's been
 
01:37:01.729 --> 01:37:01.739 align:start position:0%
conveyed To Us by the school
 
01:37:05.030 --> 01:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
and so you know I think it's important
 
01:37:06.830 --> 01:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
to recognize that all these schools
 
01:37:08.629 --> 01:37:08.639 align:start position:0%
whether they're a resource strong or
 
01:37:10.910 --> 01:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
resource weak School in terms of funding
 
01:37:13.729 --> 01:37:13.739 align:start position:0%
and the resources they make this
 
01:37:16.550 --> 01:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
available and they do the counseling and
 
01:37:18.110 --> 01:37:18.120 align:start position:0%
that's what it's all about the
 
01:37:19.729 --> 01:37:19.739 align:start position:0%
counseling the working with the teachers
 
01:37:22.310 --> 01:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
and parents interacting and asking these
 
01:37:24.050 --> 01:37:24.060 align:start position:0%
questions and students ask the same
 
01:37:25.910 --> 01:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
things so
 
01:37:28.129 --> 01:37:28.139 align:start position:0%
um and also for Career Technical
 
01:37:28.139 --> 01:37:29.750 align:start position:0%
um and also for Career Technical
education

01:37:29.750 --> 01:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:37:32.149 --> 01:37:32.159 align:start position:0%
we have more students are going on to
 
01:37:33.950 --> 01:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
Career Technical education out of that
 
01:37:35.750 --> 01:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
program than we do even out of our high
 
01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:37.250 align:start position:0%
program than we do even out of our high
schools

01:37:37.250 --> 01:37:37.260 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
and so when I talked to a student when
 
01:37:41.450 --> 01:37:41.460 align:start position:0%
we were down in Salem where are you
 
01:37:43.370 --> 01:37:43.380 align:start position:0%
going to school in the CTE program she
 
01:37:45.050 --> 01:37:45.060 align:start position:0%
said oh I was already accepted last year
 
01:37:47.629 --> 01:37:47.639 align:start position:0%
Virginia Tech
 
01:37:49.850 --> 01:37:49.860 align:start position:0%
that's also being done through our CTE
 
01:37:52.669 --> 01:37:52.679 align:start position:0%
programs there is no need to have a
 
01:37:54.410 --> 01:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
mandate that you're not going to
 
01:37:56.930 --> 01:37:56.940 align:start position:0%
graduate or the threat if you don't get
 
01:37:59.330 --> 01:37:59.340 align:start position:0%
this formula if you don't sign off and
 
01:38:01.430 --> 01:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
for a principal as I as a principal
 
01:38:03.649 --> 01:38:03.659 align:start position:0%
would have to chase students around that
 
01:38:06.229 --> 01:38:06.239 align:start position:0%
is what quite a chore I have better
 
01:38:08.450 --> 01:38:08.460 align:start position:0%
things to do in terms of curriculum
 
01:38:11.090 --> 01:38:11.100 align:start position:0%
instruction and working directly with
 
01:38:13.850 --> 01:38:13.860 align:start position:0%
the the management of the school then
 
01:38:15.649 --> 01:38:15.659 align:start position:0%
trying to chase down ensure that you
 
01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
complete the FAFSA that's not my job as
 
01:38:19.790 --> 01:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
an administrator it's really that of the
 
01:38:21.709 --> 01:38:21.719 align:start position:0%
counselor and the teachers working
 
01:38:23.990 --> 01:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
collaboratively with the parent
 
01:38:27.290 --> 01:38:27.300 align:start position:0%
and so I believe that we need to have a
 
01:38:30.050 --> 01:38:30.060 align:start position:0%
process in place in statute that's what
 
01:38:32.270 --> 01:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
this bill does it ensures the process is
 
01:38:36.050 --> 01:38:36.060 align:start position:0%
there it takes out this penalty of in
 
01:38:39.530 --> 01:38:39.540 align:start position:0%
this threat of you won't graduate we
 
01:38:41.629 --> 01:38:41.639 align:start position:0%
have a lot of indicators like 13 or 14
 
01:38:43.250 --> 01:38:43.260 align:start position:0%
is what is an opportunity for an
 
01:38:46.669 --> 01:38:46.679 align:start position:0%
adequate education in RSA 193.
 
01:38:51.590 --> 01:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
and those indicators are indicators that
 
01:38:53.870 --> 01:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
reflect on what they did either in ctes
 
01:38:55.790 --> 01:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
or where they're going off the ASVAB if
 
01:38:57.890 --> 01:38:57.900 align:start position:0%
they participated in
 
01:39:01.250 --> 01:39:01.260 align:start position:0%
um uh Advanced courses in school all
 
01:39:03.709 --> 01:39:03.719 align:start position:0%
that's there uh I don't think it's
 
01:39:05.450 --> 01:39:05.460 align:start position:0%
necessary to put another mandate like
 
01:39:07.490 --> 01:39:07.500 align:start position:0%
this in I do think it's necessary that
 
01:39:09.890 --> 01:39:09.900 align:start position:0%
schools ensure that students are
 
01:39:11.689 --> 01:39:11.699 align:start position:0%
provided this opportunity in this
 
01:39:13.189 --> 01:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
information and that's what this bill
 
01:39:16.010 --> 01:39:16.020 align:start position:0%
does it does it without the Mandate so I
 
01:39:18.229 --> 01:39:18.239 align:start position:0%
won't talk anymore about it uh seeing
 
01:39:19.910 --> 01:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
that we have had quite a discussion
 
01:39:21.709 --> 01:39:21.719 align:start position:0%
already I'll take any questions if they
 
01:39:23.149 --> 01:39:23.159 align:start position:0%
have questions if you have questions
 
01:39:25.070 --> 01:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:26.689 align:start position:0%
thank you
questions

01:39:26.689 --> 01:39:26.699 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:39:29.870 --> 01:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:31.250 --> 01:39:31.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:39:33.110 --> 01:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
um I was wondering if this one also does
 
01:39:36.050 --> 01:39:36.060 align:start position:0%
not apply to homeschool students no this
 
01:39:37.270 --> 01:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
is not
 
01:39:39.290 --> 01:39:39.300 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers students are over here in
 
01:39:42.229 --> 01:39:42.239 align:start position:0%
a separate leg of the stool uh this does
 
01:39:44.149 --> 01:39:44.159 align:start position:0%
not apply to them would there be a way
 
01:39:47.330 --> 01:39:47.340 align:start position:0%
to make it apply to them
 
01:39:50.629 --> 01:39:50.639 align:start position:0%
I I don't think it's necessary to you
 
01:39:52.550 --> 01:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
know when we've had bills come for us
 
01:39:54.830 --> 01:39:54.840 align:start position:0%
and we're in the hall and we usually get
 
01:39:56.689 --> 01:39:56.699 align:start position:0%
a huge turnout when it's a homeschool
 
01:39:58.790 --> 01:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
bill or a charter school bill
 
01:40:01.250 --> 01:40:01.260 align:start position:0%
you listen to homeschool parents and
 
01:40:03.050 --> 01:40:03.060 align:start position:0%
they're very engaged yes there's a few
 
01:40:04.790 --> 01:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
outliers as there are in regular public
 
01:40:07.790 --> 01:40:07.800 align:start position:0%
education the majority of them are there
 
01:40:10.030 --> 01:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
doing this right now with their students
 
01:40:13.550 --> 01:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
uh so I I think they're quite capable I
 
01:40:15.350 --> 01:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
think what we have to do is concern
 
01:40:17.030 --> 01:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
ourselves with you know our public
 
01:40:19.610 --> 01:40:19.620 align:start position:0%
academies our public charter schools our
 
01:40:22.910 --> 01:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
public high schools and leave it at that
 
01:40:24.950 --> 01:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
um you know we we put a lot of mandates
 
01:40:27.250 --> 01:40:27.260 align:start position:0%
out the superintendents lately
 
01:40:31.250 --> 01:40:31.260 align:start position:0%
and Dr Appleby's behind me and we put a
 
01:40:33.169 --> 01:40:33.179 align:start position:0%
request out to know how many teachers
 
01:40:34.750 --> 01:40:34.760 align:start position:0%
they were short during the school year
 
01:40:37.610 --> 01:40:37.620 align:start position:0%
yeah but we initially got what 20
 
01:40:40.370 --> 01:40:40.380 align:start position:0%
percent up to 40 percent maybe about 56
 
01:40:43.970 --> 01:40:43.980 align:start position:0%
percent compliance compliance when we
 
01:40:46.570 --> 01:40:46.580 align:start position:0%
wanted to have the uh
 
01:40:48.890 --> 01:40:48.900 align:start position:0%
school-based management plans for
 
01:40:51.770 --> 01:40:51.780 align:start position:0%
emergency situations handed in to us
 
01:40:53.930 --> 01:40:53.940 align:start position:0%
when we first talked about that on the
 
01:40:55.490 --> 01:40:55.500 align:start position:0%
public school infrastructure commission
 
01:40:59.930 --> 01:40:59.940 align:start position:0%
we had 20 percent return 20 return when
 
01:41:01.250 --> 01:41:01.260 align:start position:0%
we put a
 
01:41:04.129 --> 01:41:04.139 align:start position:0%
the carrot out there you won't receive
 
01:41:05.810 --> 01:41:05.820 align:start position:0%
any of this grant money any of this 30
 
01:41:08.750 --> 01:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
plus million dollars within two weeks we
 
01:41:10.910 --> 01:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
had them all in
 
01:41:13.250 --> 01:41:13.260 align:start position:0%
so you know we we put a lot of mandates
 
01:41:14.689 --> 01:41:14.699 align:start position:0%
out there
 
01:41:17.689 --> 01:41:17.699 align:start position:0%
um I can't believe there's a person in
 
01:41:19.669 --> 01:41:19.679 align:start position:0%
the business being a superintendent a
 
01:41:21.590 --> 01:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
principal or a commissioner or Deputy
 
01:41:23.390 --> 01:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Education really doesn't
 
01:41:26.090 --> 01:41:26.100 align:start position:0%
love kids and really is there for the
 
01:41:28.310 --> 01:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
purpose of ensuring that we can get
 
01:41:32.030 --> 01:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
every child along that path so I think
 
01:41:34.070 --> 01:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
this is basically something that we
 
01:41:35.810 --> 01:41:35.820 align:start position:0%
should be doing as far as communicating
 
01:41:39.229 --> 01:41:39.239 align:start position:0%
FAFSA but it should not be a mandate
 
01:41:41.990 --> 01:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
um that's just I don't know how we're
 
01:41:43.490 --> 01:41:43.500 align:start position:0%
ever going to turn around to a student
 
01:41:45.470 --> 01:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
and saying in another year from now from
 
01:41:47.990 --> 01:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
this summer saying you didn't complete
 
01:41:50.270 --> 01:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
this form you're not going to graduate
 
01:41:52.550 --> 01:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
that's a lawyer's dream
 
01:41:54.290 --> 01:41:54.300 align:start position:0%
especially when they have all their
 
01:41:57.169 --> 01:41:57.179 align:start position:0%
units for graduation completed and
 
01:41:58.609 --> 01:41:58.619 align:start position:0%
satisfied you're going to turn around
 
01:42:01.189 --> 01:42:01.199 align:start position:0%
and say you don't graduate and where am
 
01:42:02.990 --> 01:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
I going well I'm going off to become a
 
01:42:04.790 --> 01:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
plumber and earn more money than I would
 
01:42:06.350 --> 01:42:06.360 align:start position:0%
have as a political science or history
 
01:42:08.629 --> 01:42:08.639 align:start position:0%
major at college
 
01:42:10.129 --> 01:42:10.139 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:42:11.870 --> 01:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
representative luno
 
01:42:13.970 --> 01:42:13.980 align:start position:0%
um sure thank you very much Mr chair
 
01:42:15.109 --> 01:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
um and thanks for bringing this forward
 
01:42:17.149 --> 01:42:17.159 align:start position:0%
and I think there's there's
 
01:42:21.050 --> 01:42:21.060 align:start position:0%
um there's some you know it certainly as
 
01:42:22.729 --> 01:42:22.739 align:start position:0%
you played a strong rationale through
 
01:42:24.350 --> 01:42:24.360 align:start position:0%
this but I was wondering if such a
 
01:42:26.510 --> 01:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
brought up the Woodsville example if you
 
01:42:28.790 --> 01:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
could let the committee know what that
 
01:42:32.209 --> 01:42:32.219 align:start position:0%
completion rate is I can't tell you what
 
01:42:34.010 --> 01:42:34.020 align:start position:0%
the FAFSA completion rate is I can't
 
01:42:35.990 --> 01:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
tell you what it is for the state you'd
 
01:42:37.250 --> 01:42:37.260 align:start position:0%
probably find it off in the federal
 
01:42:37.260 --> 01:42:38.890 align:start position:0%
probably find it off in the federal
government

01:42:38.890 --> 01:42:38.900 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:42:41.570 --> 01:42:41.580 align:start position:0%
when we're looking at this there there
 
01:42:43.669 --> 01:42:43.679 align:start position:0%
are other ways you know we are a poor
 
01:42:45.229 --> 01:42:45.239 align:start position:0%
town and if you're going to go off the
 
01:42:47.570 --> 01:42:47.580 align:start position:0%
Plymouth or Keene or unh
 
01:42:50.149 --> 01:42:50.159 align:start position:0%
Granite guarantee pays for that entire
 
01:42:50.159 --> 01:42:51.770 align:start position:0%
Granite guarantee pays for that entire
tuition

01:42:51.770 --> 01:42:51.780 align:start position:0%
tuition
 
01:42:54.590 --> 01:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
so I don't need FAFSA I probably could
 
01:42:58.490 --> 01:42:58.500 align:start position:0%
come out with you know no debt so I
 
01:43:01.910 --> 01:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
don't know if if FAFSA is the the answer
 
01:43:04.790 --> 01:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
to all this uh I think what the the the
 
01:43:07.010 --> 01:43:07.020 align:start position:0%
thing we should be looking at how many
 
01:43:08.930 --> 01:43:08.940 align:start position:0%
students go off from Woodsville and get
 
01:43:12.290 --> 01:43:12.300 align:start position:0%
employment and are happy and married and
 
01:43:14.390 --> 01:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
have children there in Woodsville and
 
01:43:16.870 --> 01:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
it's high it's high
 
01:43:19.310 --> 01:43:19.320 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education is not the
 
01:43:23.390 --> 01:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
highest you know need there it's to to
 
01:43:25.250 --> 01:43:25.260 align:start position:0%
stay in my community to stay where our
 
01:43:27.350 --> 01:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
master plan says they live there because
 
01:43:29.570 --> 01:43:29.580 align:start position:0%
they want to live there they like the
 
01:43:32.689 --> 01:43:32.699 align:start position:0%
environment they like the culture and
 
01:43:34.729 --> 01:43:34.739 align:start position:0%
um and they're very successful so we
 
01:43:36.950 --> 01:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
have many people there that are in
 
01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
positions of business that don't have
 
01:43:41.149 --> 01:43:41.159 align:start position:0%
college degrees
 
01:43:44.209 --> 01:43:44.219 align:start position:0%
but more successful than I ever was
 
01:43:46.729 --> 01:43:46.739 align:start position:0%
sure and follow up on that Mr chair and
 
01:43:48.649 --> 01:43:48.659 align:start position:0%
you know certainly there are the Steve
 
01:43:50.450 --> 01:43:50.460 align:start position:0%
Jobs and Bill Gates you know examples
 
01:43:52.550 --> 01:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
both who attended college but but didn't
 
01:43:55.609 --> 01:43:55.619 align:start position:0%
graduate and certainly found success
 
01:43:58.070 --> 01:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
you know along the Malcolm Gladwell
 
01:44:00.770 --> 01:44:00.780 align:start position:0%
they're right place at the right time
 
01:44:04.250 --> 01:44:04.260 align:start position:0%
um as well and and and and interests but
 
01:44:07.070 --> 01:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
um but yeah it it honestly it it only
 
01:44:08.990 --> 01:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
took me um
 
01:44:11.870 --> 01:44:11.880 align:start position:0%
um uh from the time uh representative
 
01:44:14.390 --> 01:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
Murray was uh was called on and and
 
01:44:16.490 --> 01:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
started to ask a question she was two
 
01:44:18.470 --> 01:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
two words into it and I found the
 
01:44:22.010 --> 01:44:22.020 align:start position:0%
Woodsville data right on the the U.S Ed
 
01:44:24.590 --> 01:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
uh website and you said there's about
 
01:44:27.109 --> 01:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
250 students in Woodsville high school
 
01:44:28.810 --> 01:44:28.820 align:start position:0%
so that would be about
 
01:44:32.570 --> 01:44:32.580 align:start position:0%
60 that are in the graduating class and
 
01:44:36.890 --> 01:44:36.900 align:start position:0%
23 completed uh the FAFSA as of the 1231
 
01:44:39.770 --> 01:44:39.780 align:start position:0%
so that includes the that's the full you
 
01:44:41.570 --> 01:44:41.580 align:start position:0%
know number of number of people so it's
 
01:44:44.270 --> 01:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
slightly below State average according
 
01:44:48.229 --> 01:44:48.239 align:start position:0%
to Senator Khan's uh remarks but um but
 
01:44:50.990 --> 01:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
I was I was you know wondering when when
 
01:44:53.990 --> 01:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
we've got a
 
01:44:58.550 --> 01:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
a nonpartisan State policy that that is
 
01:45:01.729 --> 01:45:01.739 align:start position:0%
is still being you know uh presented by
 
01:45:03.229 --> 01:45:03.239 align:start position:0%
the charitable Foundation by the
 
01:45:04.490 --> 01:45:04.500 align:start position:0%
community college system by
 
01:45:06.830 --> 01:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship New Hampshire and by
 
01:45:13.129 --> 01:45:13.139 align:start position:0%
others of of 65 by 25 so 65 of the um of
 
01:45:15.830 --> 01:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
of grown-ups in New Hampshire having a
 
01:45:18.109 --> 01:45:18.119 align:start position:0%
post-secondary it doesn't have to be a
 
01:45:19.550 --> 01:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree or master's degree or
 
01:45:22.729 --> 01:45:22.739 align:start position:0%
PhD but but um or even associate's
 
01:45:25.729 --> 01:45:25.739 align:start position:0%
degree it could be a a valuable you know
 
01:45:27.709 --> 01:45:27.719 align:start position:0%
career credential
 
01:45:30.169 --> 01:45:30.179 align:start position:0%
um as um as our former Chancellor to the
 
01:45:32.030 --> 01:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
community college system used to talk
 
01:45:34.250 --> 01:45:34.260 align:start position:0%
about so eloquently
 
01:45:35.930 --> 01:45:35.940 align:start position:0%
um uh that that the community college
 
01:45:38.629 --> 01:45:38.639 align:start position:0%
system provides Pathways to careers not
 
01:45:39.830 --> 01:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily through Associate's degrees
 
01:45:42.950 --> 01:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
but how do we get there how do we get
 
01:45:46.850 --> 01:45:46.860 align:start position:0%
there with with just a policy that that
 
01:45:49.070 --> 01:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
like like you say mirrors what what
 
01:45:51.229 --> 01:45:51.239 align:start position:0%
Woodsville is doing if that's only
 
01:45:55.250 --> 01:45:55.260 align:start position:0%
achieving 23 out of out of 60 you know
 
01:45:57.530 --> 01:45:57.540 align:start position:0%
in terms of you know FAFSA completion
 
01:46:01.030 --> 01:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
how do we get to 65 by 25
 
01:46:05.030 --> 01:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
with without having something more of a
 
01:46:08.149 --> 01:46:08.159 align:start position:0%
stick and I wouldn't call it a uh it's
 
01:46:10.729 --> 01:46:10.739 align:start position:0%
it's not a stick you're you're not going
 
01:46:12.770 --> 01:46:12.780 align:start position:0%
to graduate Luke
 
01:46:15.890 --> 01:46:15.900 align:start position:0%
um uh it's uh it's uh it's a it's a
 
01:46:18.890 --> 01:46:18.900 align:start position:0%
stick saying you know what if um if if
 
01:46:22.850 --> 01:46:22.860 align:start position:0%
you really don't want to find out find
 
01:46:22.860 --> 01:46:23.629 align:start position:0%
you really don't want to find out find
out

01:46:23.629 --> 01:46:23.639 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:46:25.850 --> 01:46:25.860 align:start position:0%
that's all it's about finding out if you
 
01:46:27.470 --> 01:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
really don't want to find out I'll write
 
01:46:30.169 --> 01:46:30.179 align:start position:0%
you a waiver but uh but but we need you
 
01:46:32.510 --> 01:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
and your folks to come down tomorrow
 
01:46:35.750 --> 01:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
night to um to the Woodsville library
 
01:46:38.990 --> 01:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
and and learn about the FAFSA how do we
 
01:46:41.209 --> 01:46:41.219 align:start position:0%
make that happen how do we get to 65 by
 
01:46:43.550 --> 01:46:43.560 align:start position:0%
25 without having a little more behind
 
01:46:44.810 --> 01:46:44.820 align:start position:0%
this like what's in the current we're
 
01:46:47.510 --> 01:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
not going to get the 65-25 we're there I
 
01:46:50.209 --> 01:46:50.219 align:start position:0%
agree with that okay so that was Ross
 
01:46:51.410 --> 01:46:51.420 align:start position:0%
cattell's deal
 
01:46:51.420 --> 01:46:55.030 align:start position:0%
cattell's deal
um

01:46:55.030 --> 01:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:57.950 --> 01:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
to a Hanover I don't want to live in
 
01:46:59.689 --> 01:46:59.699 align:start position:0%
Hanover I don't want to live there
 
01:47:02.629 --> 01:47:02.639 align:start position:0%
period for a lot of reasons
 
01:47:05.590 --> 01:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
and those folks that are coming out of
 
01:47:09.109 --> 01:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
Woodsville Haverhill area
 
01:47:11.209 --> 01:47:11.219 align:start position:0%
I don't think we need to have another
 
01:47:13.910 --> 01:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
mandate where our teachers are going to
 
01:47:15.890 --> 01:47:15.900 align:start position:0%
our counselors or principals or
 
01:47:18.109 --> 01:47:18.119 align:start position:0%
superintendent are going to have to run
 
01:47:21.410 --> 01:47:21.420 align:start position:0%
down all these students we are trying to
 
01:47:25.129 --> 01:47:25.139 align:start position:0%
run a school uh in a way that is best
 
01:47:26.570 --> 01:47:26.580 align:start position:0%
satisfying that community and the
 
01:47:28.430 --> 01:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
students within it and I think it's a
 
01:47:31.030 --> 01:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
darn good job that they're doing
 
01:47:33.950 --> 01:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
this is just throwing another mandate in
 
01:47:36.950 --> 01:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
our NFA on our face and it's contrary to
 
01:47:38.510 --> 01:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
local control
 
01:47:41.149 --> 01:47:41.159 align:start position:0%
it's contrary to where we really should
 
01:47:43.430 --> 01:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
be as a legislature this is a local
 
01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:45.350 align:start position:0%
be as a legislature this is a local
decision

01:47:45.350 --> 01:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
decision
 
01:47:48.350 --> 01:47:48.360 align:start position:0%
um and I think it's being followed to
 
01:47:52.010 --> 01:47:52.020 align:start position:0%
have that many students going off as you
 
01:47:54.530 --> 01:47:54.540 align:start position:0%
know or FAFSA I would like to know what
 
01:47:55.729 --> 01:47:55.739 align:start position:0%
the total number of kids are they're
 
01:47:57.890 --> 01:47:57.900 align:start position:0%
going off to college from up there I
 
01:47:59.510 --> 01:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
know there's a number of students in
 
01:48:01.310 --> 01:48:01.320 align:start position:0%
there that don't want anything to do
 
01:48:04.070 --> 01:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
with FAFSA that are already going to go
 
01:48:06.770 --> 01:48:06.780 align:start position:0%
to school or are at post-secondary right
 
01:48:09.709 --> 01:48:09.719 align:start position:0%
now I don't think pafsa is really an
 
01:48:11.990 --> 01:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
indicator of how many folks are going
 
01:48:14.870 --> 01:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
off to post-secondary education and I
 
01:48:16.430 --> 01:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
don't think we should use it as an
 
01:48:18.350 --> 01:48:18.360 align:start position:0%
indicator either
 
01:48:20.390 --> 01:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions for
 
01:48:22.609 --> 01:48:22.619 align:start position:0%
representative land see none oh yes
 
01:48:25.250 --> 01:48:25.260 align:start position:0%
representative Balboni sorry thank you
 
01:48:27.109 --> 01:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question I
 
01:48:28.669 --> 01:48:28.679 align:start position:0%
think you might have just answered it
 
01:48:28.679 --> 01:48:29.510 align:start position:0%
think you might have just answered it
though

01:48:29.510 --> 01:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
though
 
01:48:32.450 --> 01:48:32.460 align:start position:0%
um is that why you're repealing
 
01:48:32.460 --> 01:48:34.570 align:start position:0%
um is that why you're repealing
um

01:48:34.570 --> 01:48:34.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:39.970 --> 01:48:39.980 align:start position:0%
193 E3 one oh
 
01:48:43.070 --> 01:48:43.080 align:start position:0%
193 e one you're getting down to the
 
01:48:47.450 --> 01:48:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:50.030 --> 01:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
I I if you're talking about repealing
 
01:48:53.270 --> 01:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
the FAFSA requirement no it's the
 
01:48:58.209 --> 01:48:58.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:00.770 --> 01:49:00.780 align:start position:0%
when I made all those reports as the
 
01:49:02.689 --> 01:49:02.699 align:start position:0%
school principal or
 
01:49:05.209 --> 01:49:05.219 align:start position:0%
I oftentimes wondered what's happening
 
01:49:08.270 --> 01:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
with mfdoe
 
01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:09.109 align:start position:0%
with mfdoe
um

01:49:09.109 --> 01:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:13.910 --> 01:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
going into a pile never read uh we knew
 
01:49:16.250 --> 01:49:16.260 align:start position:0%
we had worked with the parents and I
 
01:49:17.810 --> 01:49:17.820 align:start position:0%
think we had accomplished what we were
 
01:49:19.609 --> 01:49:19.619 align:start position:0%
supposed to do the kids were graduating
 
01:49:21.470 --> 01:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
had that opportunity for an adequate
 
01:49:25.609 --> 01:49:25.619 align:start position:0%
education and went on to jobs uh so I I
 
01:49:27.410 --> 01:49:27.420 align:start position:0%
think this is an area that I question
 
01:49:29.390 --> 01:49:29.400 align:start position:0%
even when this bill went forward and I
 
01:49:31.010 --> 01:49:31.020 align:start position:0%
think most of us that were there at the
 
01:49:34.129 --> 01:49:34.139 align:start position:0%
time said well we were able to kind of
 
01:49:37.850 --> 01:49:37.860 align:start position:0%
uh make the absolute requirement if you
 
01:49:39.470 --> 01:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
if you don't fill this thing out you're
 
01:49:41.750 --> 01:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
not going to graduate we sideline that
 
01:49:43.910 --> 01:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
with the option that you could have this
 
01:49:46.910 --> 01:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
form I still think that's really kind of
 
01:49:50.930 --> 01:49:50.940 align:start position:0%
inappropriate I think that it's uh it's
 
01:49:52.490 --> 01:49:52.500 align:start position:0%
the state with their big hand getting
 
01:49:55.550 --> 01:49:55.560 align:start position:0%
down on top of those districts where we
 
01:49:57.830 --> 01:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
know what is best for our students and
 
01:50:00.470 --> 01:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
we there I think that you you try to
 
01:50:02.330 --> 01:50:02.340 align:start position:0%
find for me the schools which are not
 
01:50:05.030 --> 01:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
doing dealing with FAFSA right now that
 
01:50:07.490 --> 01:50:07.500 align:start position:0%
are not counseling that are not working
 
01:50:09.770 --> 01:50:09.780 align:start position:0%
with students and Advising them that
 
01:50:11.570 --> 01:50:11.580 align:start position:0%
this is an opportunity where you can
 
01:50:13.550 --> 01:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
receive some dollars to help go to
 
01:50:15.709 --> 01:50:15.719 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education I'm open to
 
01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
that and that's what this bill does it
 
01:50:20.390 --> 01:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
suggests that you know you can do it
 
01:50:22.609 --> 01:50:22.619 align:start position:0%
through programs with parents at night
 
01:50:25.270 --> 01:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
which is done I think most everywhere
 
01:50:27.530 --> 01:50:27.540 align:start position:0%
you can have counselors dealing with
 
01:50:29.629 --> 01:50:29.639 align:start position:0%
large groups and small groups that's
 
01:50:32.270 --> 01:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
what should be going on at school during
 
01:50:34.189 --> 01:50:34.199 align:start position:0%
the day you can embed this into your
 
01:50:36.189 --> 01:50:36.199 align:start position:0%
various classes what you're teaching
 
01:50:38.570 --> 01:50:38.580 align:start position:0%
certainly if you're talking Finance
 
01:50:40.129 --> 01:50:40.139 align:start position:0%
literacy you should also be talking
 
01:50:42.709 --> 01:50:42.719 align:start position:0%
about how do I come out of college you
 
01:50:44.590 --> 01:50:44.600 align:start position:0%
know debt free hopefully
 
01:50:46.850 --> 01:50:46.860 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of different ways of doing
 
01:50:48.350 --> 01:50:48.360 align:start position:0%
this just like our social studies
 
01:50:50.390 --> 01:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
teacher takes students down to these
 
01:50:51.890 --> 01:50:51.900 align:start position:0%
colleges and checks them out in the
 
01:50:53.810 --> 01:50:53.820 align:start position:0%
Boston area
 
01:50:55.850 --> 01:50:55.860 align:start position:0%
um I can't help that most of the
 
01:50:58.430 --> 01:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
students uh up my way do choose to go to
 
01:51:01.189 --> 01:51:01.199 align:start position:0%
school out of state it's always greener
 
01:51:02.570 --> 01:51:02.580 align:start position:0%
on the other side of the pasture for
 
01:51:04.550 --> 01:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
these kids you know it's you know they
 
01:51:07.189 --> 01:51:07.199 align:start position:0%
all come back most of them come back so
 
01:51:08.930 --> 01:51:08.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:51:12.109 --> 01:51:12.119 align:start position:0%
follow up just a quick follow-up so I
 
01:51:13.790 --> 01:51:13.800 align:start position:0%
guess when you get into the reporting
 
01:51:16.910 --> 01:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
you're saying that you you don't see the
 
01:51:19.189 --> 01:51:19.199 align:start position:0%
value in in having that reported out
 
01:51:21.350 --> 01:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
that if we're reporting if we're
 
01:51:21.360 --> 01:51:23.990 align:start position:0%
that if we're reporting if we're
reporting

01:51:23.990 --> 01:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:26.030 --> 01:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
did we deliver an opportunity for an
 
01:51:27.709 --> 01:51:27.719 align:start position:0%
adequate education that's what I'd look
 
01:51:29.149 --> 01:51:29.159 align:start position:0%
at all those indicators trying to
 
01:51:32.149 --> 01:51:32.159 align:start position:0%
identify and report to our department of
 
01:51:34.010 --> 01:51:34.020 align:start position:0%
education and there's a number of them
 
01:51:35.629 --> 01:51:35.639 align:start position:0%
listed there you know were there how
 
01:51:37.370 --> 01:51:37.380 align:start position:0%
many suspensions expulsions where you're
 
01:51:38.750 --> 01:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
in the school I think that's important
 
01:51:40.189 --> 01:51:40.199 align:start position:0%
to know
 
01:51:42.290 --> 01:51:42.300 align:start position:0%
um how many students are going on to
 
01:51:44.149 --> 01:51:44.159 align:start position:0%
post-secondary I think that's important
 
01:51:46.010 --> 01:51:46.020 align:start position:0%
to know and I think it's even more
 
01:51:47.570 --> 01:51:47.580 align:start position:0%
important to find out how many actually
 
01:51:50.270 --> 01:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
go to post-secondary education and come
 
01:51:52.609 --> 01:51:52.619 align:start position:0%
out and graduate all those other
 
01:51:55.729 --> 01:51:55.739 align:start position:0%
indicators but I don't know how we can
 
01:51:58.250 --> 01:51:58.260 align:start position:0%
say that this is a requirement or this
 
01:52:01.729 --> 01:52:01.739 align:start position:0%
report impacts as an indicator that that
 
01:52:04.250 --> 01:52:04.260 align:start position:0%
child has received an adequate education
 
01:52:05.930 --> 01:52:05.940 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with it
 
01:52:09.229 --> 01:52:09.239 align:start position:0%
has absolutely nothing to do with it uh
 
01:52:12.470 --> 01:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
the other indicators do come back and
 
01:52:16.550 --> 01:52:16.560 align:start position:0%
relate to Advanced AP courses the re
 
01:52:19.129 --> 01:52:19.139 align:start position:0%
revolve to the CTE programs that they've
 
01:52:22.609 --> 01:52:22.619 align:start position:0%
taken uh it uh it provides that
 
01:52:25.609 --> 01:52:25.619 align:start position:0%
information to the department that we
 
01:52:27.590 --> 01:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
are doing this and students are
 
01:52:29.570 --> 01:52:29.580 align:start position:0%
graduating and they have been delivered
 
01:52:30.890 --> 01:52:30.900 align:start position:0%
that opportunity for an adequate
 
01:52:30.900 --> 01:52:33.410 align:start position:0%
that opportunity for an adequate
education

01:52:33.410 --> 01:52:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:38.290 --> 01:52:38.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:40.850 --> 01:52:40.860 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman
 
01:52:43.729 --> 01:52:43.739 align:start position:0%
um being from Rochester I was a little
 
01:52:46.129 --> 01:52:46.139 align:start position:0%
dismayed to hear that Senator Cam said
 
01:52:48.430 --> 01:52:48.440 align:start position:0%
that you know Rochester has a 20
 
01:52:50.570 --> 01:52:50.580 align:start position:0%
participation rate as far as Fabs is
 
01:52:52.669 --> 01:52:52.679 align:start position:0%
concerned I know that they do the
 
01:52:54.530 --> 01:52:54.540 align:start position:0%
parents nights
 
01:52:55.910 --> 01:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
um by the way I have two children one at
 
01:52:56.870 --> 01:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
the University of New Hampshire one at
 
01:52:58.189 --> 01:52:58.199 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire grandchildren
 
01:52:59.810 --> 01:52:59.820 align:start position:0%
wanted two grandchildren who are
 
01:53:01.070 --> 01:53:01.080 align:start position:0%
currently at UNH in Southern New
 
01:53:02.870 --> 01:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and two children who graduated
 
01:53:04.129 --> 01:53:04.139 align:start position:0%
from University of New Hampshire as well
 
01:53:05.750 --> 01:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
so but
 
01:53:08.209 --> 01:53:08.219 align:start position:0%
um the I know that they do parents
 
01:53:10.550 --> 01:53:10.560 align:start position:0%
nights I know that they do Outreach to
 
01:53:13.070 --> 01:53:13.080 align:start position:0%
the thing to the to the families as well
 
01:53:16.430 --> 01:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
but 20 of of the people in Rochester
 
01:53:19.370 --> 01:53:19.380 align:start position:0%
fill out these forms it seems it's a
 
01:53:22.790 --> 01:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
problem we have one of the highest rates
 
01:53:25.430 --> 01:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
of free and student and free and reduced
 
01:53:27.649 --> 01:53:27.659 align:start position:0%
lunches in the state we have one of the
 
01:53:29.930 --> 01:53:29.940 align:start position:0%
larger communities per capita of welfare
 
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
families in the state as well and it
 
01:53:35.870 --> 01:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
seems that the the only way that these
 
01:53:37.729 --> 01:53:37.739 align:start position:0%
kids are going to get to break that
 
01:53:39.770 --> 01:53:39.780 align:start position:0%
cycle of poverty and I can't remember
 
01:53:42.109 --> 01:53:42.119 align:start position:0%
who said it but the greatest equalizer
 
01:53:45.229 --> 01:53:45.239 align:start position:0%
in this country is is a quality
 
01:53:47.709 --> 01:53:47.719 align:start position:0%
education and
 
01:53:50.750 --> 01:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
I know guidance counselors encourage
 
01:53:52.010 --> 01:53:52.020 align:start position:0%
children to fill out these things
 
01:53:53.570 --> 01:53:53.580 align:start position:0%
because I hear the complaints that all
 
01:53:55.609 --> 01:53:55.619 align:start position:0%
the guide counselors do is push going to
 
01:53:55.619 --> 01:53:56.470 align:start position:0%
the guide counselors do is push going to
college

01:53:56.470 --> 01:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
college
 
01:53:59.570 --> 01:53:59.580 align:start position:0%
but the thing is is that if we're doing
 
01:54:01.850 --> 01:54:01.860 align:start position:0%
a lot of those things I mean I can't get
 
01:54:04.609 --> 01:54:04.619 align:start position:0%
my school district to have to afford
 
01:54:06.169 --> 01:54:06.179 align:start position:0%
buses to bring them here to the state
 
01:54:08.330 --> 01:54:08.340 align:start position:0%
house so fourth graders I've got one
 
01:54:09.950 --> 01:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
school coming out of the whole city of
 
01:54:11.810 --> 01:54:11.820 align:start position:0%
Rochester because the PTO had to raise
 
01:54:14.209 --> 01:54:14.219 align:start position:0%
the money this question didn't have the
 
01:54:16.129 --> 01:54:16.139 align:start position:0%
money how do we fix it when we're
 
01:54:17.930 --> 01:54:17.940 align:start position:0%
basically doing most of what's in your
 
01:54:19.490 --> 01:54:19.500 align:start position:0%
Amendment and we're still not getting
 
01:54:21.530 --> 01:54:21.540 align:start position:0%
the results
 
01:54:24.770 --> 01:54:24.780 align:start position:0%
look at your adequacy bill now look at
 
01:54:26.090 --> 01:54:26.100 align:start position:0%
the finance bill that we have going
 
01:54:27.350 --> 01:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
through the senate in the house right
 
01:54:29.390 --> 01:54:29.400 align:start position:0%
now that's we're going to fix some of it
 
01:54:31.310 --> 01:54:31.320 align:start position:0%
right there but it's also it goes back
 
01:54:33.530 --> 01:54:33.540 align:start position:0%
to leadership within the building
 
01:54:36.649 --> 01:54:36.659 align:start position:0%
and Leadership and expectation and our
 
01:54:38.930 --> 01:54:38.940 align:start position:0%
parents and our is the school on the
 
01:54:41.149 --> 01:54:41.159 align:start position:0%
same wavelength are they aligned with
 
01:54:43.609 --> 01:54:43.619 align:start position:0%
the aspiration that we want our child to
 
01:54:46.609 --> 01:54:46.619 align:start position:0%
have this opportunity I'd also ask the
 
01:54:48.470 --> 01:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
question in Rochester how many students
 
01:54:50.510 --> 01:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
are going on to post-secondary education
 
01:54:52.430 --> 01:54:52.440 align:start position:0%
how many students are going off to work
 
01:54:54.410 --> 01:54:54.420 align:start position:0%
in the military how many students are
 
01:54:57.649 --> 01:54:57.659 align:start position:0%
off to write out as a result of the CTE
 
01:55:00.169 --> 01:55:00.179 align:start position:0%
program down there which are going off
 
01:55:03.470 --> 01:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
with a an industrial recognized
 
01:55:05.350 --> 01:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
certificate already
 
01:55:08.030 --> 01:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
all those have to are part of that
 
01:55:10.189 --> 01:55:10.199 align:start position:0%
equation it's just not FAFSA alone
 
01:55:13.850 --> 01:55:13.860 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more to this which we We
 
01:55:16.970 --> 01:55:16.980 align:start position:0%
Gather that information to have that I
 
01:55:19.250 --> 01:55:19.260 align:start position:0%
I'd be very shocked if it's only 20 of
 
01:55:20.689 --> 01:55:20.699 align:start position:0%
the kids in Rochester going off to
 
01:55:20.699 --> 01:55:24.410 align:start position:0%
the kids in Rochester going off to
college

01:55:24.410 --> 01:55:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:26.109 --> 01:55:26.119 align:start position:0%
um yes representative
 
01:55:29.450 --> 01:55:29.460 align:start position:0%
thank you I was wondering about the
 
01:55:31.430 --> 01:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
reporting part of it too
 
01:55:33.350 --> 01:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
um because I think some of the other
 
01:55:36.410 --> 01:55:36.420 align:start position:0%
parts of it make sense to me of your
 
01:55:40.129 --> 01:55:40.139 align:start position:0%
Amendment but with the the new and
 
01:55:42.770 --> 01:55:42.780 align:start position:0%
improved internet program that the doe
 
01:55:45.890 --> 01:55:45.900 align:start position:0%
has with the I report I mean it seems to
 
01:55:47.450 --> 01:55:47.460 align:start position:0%
me that it would be
 
01:55:49.910 --> 01:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
that that's where it would be visible
 
01:55:53.629 --> 01:55:53.639 align:start position:0%
rather than uh before that actually came
 
01:55:55.850 --> 01:55:55.860 align:start position:0%
online where they just kind of shoved it
 
01:55:58.970 --> 01:55:58.980 align:start position:0%
in a file now we can look on and find a
 
01:56:01.310 --> 01:56:01.320 align:start position:0%
whole lot of information about each
 
01:56:03.350 --> 01:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
school and I think this might be an
 
01:56:06.350 --> 01:56:06.360 align:start position:0%
important thing to to be there I think
 
01:56:08.530 --> 01:56:08.540 align:start position:0%
that having this uh
 
01:56:11.270 --> 01:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
the bill as maybe perhaps written by
 
01:56:13.010 --> 01:56:13.020 align:start position:0%
this amendment it's very important to
 
01:56:17.270 --> 01:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
have in place uh I for one though am a
 
01:56:19.550 --> 01:56:19.560 align:start position:0%
little old school I as I think you are
 
01:56:21.709 --> 01:56:21.719 align:start position:0%
or representative Tanner with those
 
01:56:23.629 --> 01:56:23.639 align:start position:0%
statutes I want to have the book in
 
01:56:26.450 --> 01:56:26.460 align:start position:0%
front of me uh when I'm talking with
 
01:56:29.330 --> 01:56:29.340 align:start position:0%
folks it takes me usually 20 20 minutes
 
01:56:31.729 --> 01:56:31.739 align:start position:0%
or so before I really get to the point
 
01:56:33.410 --> 01:56:33.420 align:start position:0%
where I'm really starting to think on
 
01:56:35.830 --> 01:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
that topic in depth
 
01:56:39.169 --> 01:56:39.179 align:start position:0%
and I think that the eyeball to eyeball
 
01:56:42.169 --> 01:56:42.179 align:start position:0%
communication rather than always on the
 
01:56:44.390 --> 01:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
web is really important for students to
 
01:56:46.310 --> 01:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
see somebody that's really
 
01:56:48.770 --> 01:56:48.780 align:start position:0%
asking them the questions and having the
 
01:56:51.709 --> 01:56:51.719 align:start position:0%
discussion with them regarding where are
 
01:56:54.470 --> 01:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
you going what do you plan on doing
 
01:56:58.129 --> 01:56:58.139 align:start position:0%
um are you taking as a freshman and
 
01:57:00.109 --> 01:57:00.119 align:start position:0%
engaging as a freshman and sophomore the
 
01:57:01.550 --> 01:57:01.560 align:start position:0%
types of courses that are going to lead
 
01:57:03.410 --> 01:57:03.420 align:start position:0%
toward that school I think it doesn't
 
01:57:06.410 --> 01:57:06.420 align:start position:0%
just start as a senior and as one of the
 
01:57:08.270 --> 01:57:08.280 align:start position:0%
superintendents mentioned they have the
 
01:57:09.709 --> 01:57:09.719 align:start position:0%
Freshman evenings and that's what they
 
01:57:12.950 --> 01:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
do at CJ Academy as well and so it's and
 
01:57:15.229 --> 01:57:15.239 align:start position:0%
that's why I am taking the trip now at
 
01:57:17.149 --> 01:57:17.159 align:start position:0%
the end of that freshman year down to
 
01:57:19.609 --> 01:57:19.619 align:start position:0%
Carolina with my grandkid to really
 
01:57:20.830 --> 01:57:20.840 align:start position:0%
start looking
 
01:57:24.290 --> 01:57:24.300 align:start position:0%
I think that's important so it's and
 
01:57:26.390 --> 01:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
we'll find out yes there'll probably be
 
01:57:30.890 --> 01:57:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:35.089 --> 01:57:35.099 align:start position:0%
yes I that wasn't like my point my point
 
01:57:35.099 --> 01:57:36.109 align:start position:0%
yes I that wasn't like my point my point
was

01:57:36.109 --> 01:57:36.119 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:57:37.850 --> 01:57:37.860 align:start position:0%
um because I totally agree with you I'm
 
01:57:40.189 --> 01:57:40.199 align:start position:0%
old school and yes you know talking to
 
01:57:41.950 --> 01:57:41.960 align:start position:0%
the kids being Hands-On with the kids
 
01:57:44.930 --> 01:57:44.940 align:start position:0%
but the reporting requirement that
 
01:57:46.490 --> 01:57:46.500 align:start position:0%
you've you've
 
01:57:46.500 --> 01:57:47.770 align:start position:0%
you've you've
um

01:57:47.770 --> 01:57:47.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:50.870 --> 01:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
deleted in on page two
 
01:57:54.109 --> 01:57:54.119 align:start position:0%
um lines three through five the repeal
 
01:57:58.310 --> 01:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
the reports I'm and uh I believe when um
 
01:58:00.410 --> 01:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
representative Balboni talked uh asked
 
01:58:01.490 --> 01:58:01.500 align:start position:0%
you the question you said you didn't
 
01:58:02.870 --> 01:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
know what happened down at the state
 
01:58:04.970 --> 01:58:04.980 align:start position:0%
department with these you know and I
 
01:58:07.250 --> 01:58:07.260 align:start position:0%
agree we asked them to file things and
 
01:58:09.950 --> 01:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's you know where to where
 
01:58:11.450 --> 01:58:11.460 align:start position:0%
does it end up but I'm just saying
 
01:58:13.189 --> 01:58:13.199 align:start position:0%
something like this might be an
 
01:58:16.550 --> 01:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
important part of the I report where it
 
01:58:18.649 --> 01:58:18.659 align:start position:0%
gives characteristics of each school I
 
01:58:20.330 --> 01:58:20.340 align:start position:0%
have no objections to that the FAFSA
 
01:58:22.250 --> 01:58:22.260 align:start position:0%
information is available on the federal
 
01:58:24.830 --> 01:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
level it's just like represent luno was
 
01:58:26.629 --> 01:58:26.639 align:start position:0%
able to say here's where Woodsville is
 
01:58:28.189 --> 01:58:28.199 align:start position:0%
just like that because that information
 
01:58:30.830 --> 01:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
is available but this is this bill
 
01:58:34.689 --> 01:58:34.699 align:start position:0%
actually if you don't repeal that yes
 
01:58:39.310 --> 01:58:39.320 align:start position:0%
sorry allows the doe to or actually
 
01:58:42.229 --> 01:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
directs the doe I believe to
 
01:58:45.589 --> 01:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
um or the schools to submit that report
 
01:58:45.599 --> 01:58:46.669 align:start position:0%
um or the schools to submit that report
um

01:58:46.669 --> 01:58:46.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:49.189 --> 01:58:49.199 align:start position:0%
to the DOE
 
01:58:49.199 --> 01:58:50.750 align:start position:0%
to the DOE
um

01:58:50.750 --> 01:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:52.669 --> 01:58:52.679 align:start position:0%
I don't have that I see I don't believe
 
01:58:54.709 --> 01:58:54.719 align:start position:0%
it's necessary you have to report this
 
01:58:57.410 --> 01:58:57.420 align:start position:0%
stuff to doe I think that it's already
 
01:58:59.390 --> 01:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
reported to the federal government so it
 
01:59:01.550 --> 01:59:01.560 align:start position:0%
is available doe if they wanted they
 
01:59:02.990 --> 01:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
could put it on the web they can get it
 
01:59:04.189 --> 01:59:04.199 align:start position:0%
from the federal government and put it
 
01:59:07.070 --> 01:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
on their I platform uh but I don't think
 
01:59:09.050 --> 01:59:09.060 align:start position:0%
this is what you're doing is you're
 
01:59:10.930 --> 01:59:10.940 align:start position:0%
telling that school district again
 
01:59:14.270 --> 01:59:14.280 align:start position:0%
here's something else you got to be
 
01:59:17.149 --> 01:59:17.159 align:start position:0%
handling and I there's a point where we
 
01:59:20.470 --> 01:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
got to say we cannot be
 
01:59:23.870 --> 01:59:23.880 align:start position:0%
asking these schools to do everything
 
01:59:26.750 --> 01:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
that we think of that's necessary and
 
01:59:28.430 --> 01:59:28.440 align:start position:0%
forget what you're doing down there
 
01:59:31.970 --> 01:59:31.980 align:start position:0%
which is so very important uh I'd rather
 
01:59:34.970 --> 01:59:34.980 align:start position:0%
say let the schools figure this out and
 
01:59:37.250 --> 01:59:37.260 align:start position:0%
this is something we have to you know
 
01:59:40.010 --> 01:59:40.020 align:start position:0%
that the diploma is not issued by the
 
01:59:42.530 --> 01:59:42.540 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire this diplomas
 
01:59:46.070 --> 01:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
issued by your local school district and
 
01:59:47.570 --> 01:59:47.580 align:start position:0%
that school board is awarding that
 
01:59:50.450 --> 01:59:50.460 align:start position:0%
diploma so there's where it belongs
 
01:59:53.030 --> 01:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
right there uh
 
01:59:55.729 --> 01:59:55.739 align:start position:0%
I guess I'll stop right with that
 
01:59:58.010 --> 01:59:58.020 align:start position:0%
see no further questions thank you very
 
01:59:59.990 --> 02:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
much you're welcome and I do not believe
 
02:00:02.930 --> 02:00:02.940 align:start position:0%
there are any further cards for this uh
 
02:00:05.390 --> 02:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh so I'll close the hearing
 
02:00:07.970 --> 02:00:07.980 align:start position:0%
on this and we'll turn the gavel back
 
02:00:31.550 --> 02:00:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:33.290 --> 02:00:33.300 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:00:35.810 --> 02:00:35.820 align:start position:0%
you got five minutes so thanks thanks no
 
02:00:38.750 --> 02:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
and I'll I'll make this this uh this
 
02:00:40.669 --> 02:00:40.679 align:start position:0%
this quick too thank you very much Mr
 
02:00:43.129 --> 02:00:43.139 align:start position:0%
chair so for the record Dave luno uh
 
02:00:44.510 --> 02:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
representing people in Marymount County
 
02:00:48.109 --> 02:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
District nine uh for folks that uh that
 
02:00:50.270 --> 02:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
live in uh Hopkinton and Beau and I
 
02:00:52.010 --> 02:00:52.020 align:start position:0%
always include Concord because Mel and I
 
02:00:53.270 --> 02:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
are never going to give up on Concord
 
02:00:55.609 --> 02:00:55.619 align:start position:0%
either and across the granite state
 
02:00:58.550 --> 02:00:58.560 align:start position:0%
um but I'm here to introduce um
 
02:01:03.169 --> 02:01:03.179 align:start position:0%
amendment number 1812h just to be clear
 
02:01:05.270 --> 02:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
um really clear I support the the
 
02:01:08.149 --> 02:01:08.159 align:start position:0%
statute that's currently in law so I'm
 
02:01:10.490 --> 02:01:10.500 align:start position:0%
not supporting any of these amendments
 
02:01:13.609 --> 02:01:13.619 align:start position:0%
but I did want to offer this one as a as
 
02:01:15.410 --> 02:01:15.420 align:start position:0%
a third alternative since we're
 
02:01:18.290 --> 02:01:18.300 align:start position:0%
dedicating this morning to uh to
 
02:01:20.510 --> 02:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
speaking about non-germaine
 
02:01:23.750 --> 02:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
um uh amendments to Senate bill 136. and
 
02:01:27.350 --> 02:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
so um so really what uh What uh
 
02:01:32.209 --> 02:01:32.219 align:start position:0%
Amendment 1812 does is um is adds one
 
02:01:37.129 --> 02:01:37.139 align:start position:0%
more mechanism to uh that's available to
 
02:01:39.649 --> 02:01:39.659 align:start position:0%
uh to principals to school districts in
 
02:01:42.109 --> 02:01:42.119 align:start position:0%
this process so Senator Khan talked
 
02:01:43.910 --> 02:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
about the three mechanisms that are in
 
02:01:45.830 --> 02:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
place in the undercurrent statute
 
02:01:49.310 --> 02:01:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:51.649 --> 02:01:51.659 align:start position:0%
complete the waiver
 
02:01:55.729 --> 02:01:55.739 align:start position:0%
or the principal attests to that the
 
02:01:57.229 --> 02:01:57.239 align:start position:0%
school has provided support and
 
02:01:59.390 --> 02:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
assistance in informing students and
 
02:02:02.629 --> 02:02:02.639 align:start position:0%
families to to how to uh how to complete
 
02:02:04.729 --> 02:02:04.739 align:start position:0%
the uh the FAFSA
 
02:02:07.629 --> 02:02:07.639 align:start position:0%
this creates a fourth
 
02:02:12.050 --> 02:02:12.060 align:start position:0%
mechanism to um uh for principals to say
 
02:02:13.910 --> 02:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
hey you know what we've achieved the
 
02:02:16.850 --> 02:02:16.860 align:start position:0%
number and uh and that fourth mechanism
 
02:02:20.209 --> 02:02:20.219 align:start position:0%
is by reaching an 80 FAFSA completion
 
02:02:22.790 --> 02:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
rate as has been done in other states
 
02:02:25.970 --> 02:02:25.980 align:start position:0%
that um uh that have enacted laws
 
02:02:28.310 --> 02:02:28.320 align:start position:0%
similar to what we have on the book that
 
02:02:30.770 --> 02:02:30.780 align:start position:0%
would take effect on July 1st and apply
 
02:02:33.890 --> 02:02:33.900 align:start position:0%
to the school year that ends um uh in
 
02:02:38.270 --> 02:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
June of 2024. so um so that's that's all
 
02:02:40.850 --> 02:02:40.860 align:start position:0%
that that this does so for district set
 
02:02:45.169 --> 02:02:45.179 align:start position:0%
that um that are providing
 
02:02:48.290 --> 02:02:48.300 align:start position:0%
local Education Services to students and
 
02:02:51.229 --> 02:02:51.239 align:start position:0%
families in terms of how to complete the
 
02:02:53.270 --> 02:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
FAFSA what the FAFSA is where the
 
02:02:55.310 --> 02:02:55.320 align:start position:0%
availability of information is and and
 
02:02:56.629 --> 02:02:56.639 align:start position:0%
running that just like what we heard
 
02:02:59.390 --> 02:02:59.400 align:start position:0%
from um uh from the superintendents in
 
02:03:01.850 --> 02:03:01.860 align:start position:0%
Goffstown and Bedford and they're able
 
02:03:04.609 --> 02:03:04.619 align:start position:0%
to achieve that 60 percent I mean that
 
02:03:05.990 --> 02:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
80 percent
 
02:03:08.450 --> 02:03:08.460 align:start position:0%
um uh success rate great they're done no
 
02:03:09.770 --> 02:03:09.780 align:start position:0%
burden at all
 
02:03:11.450 --> 02:03:11.460 align:start position:0%
um principal said you know what we're at
 
02:03:14.030 --> 02:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
we're at 80 percent and which they can
 
02:03:15.649 --> 02:03:15.659 align:start position:0%
find out varies the fact they don't even
 
02:03:19.490 --> 02:03:19.500 align:start position:0%
need to chase down FAFSA paperwork or or
 
02:03:22.129 --> 02:03:22.139 align:start position:0%
um uh you know letters from families
 
02:03:23.450 --> 02:03:23.460 align:start position:0%
saying they've completed the FAFSA
 
02:03:26.390 --> 02:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
because the information is available on
 
02:03:28.850 --> 02:03:28.860 align:start position:0%
the US Ed website under federal student
 
02:03:31.850 --> 02:03:31.860 align:start position:0%
aid and uh in fact if you if you just
 
02:03:33.830 --> 02:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
look up online
 
02:03:36.830 --> 02:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
um federal student aid and plug in the
 
02:03:39.290 --> 02:03:39.300 align:start position:0%
name of your town Bedford New Hampshire
 
02:03:41.390 --> 02:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
it's the first thing that'll come up you
 
02:03:43.669 --> 02:03:43.679 align:start position:0%
click on it and you can download a
 
02:03:45.290 --> 02:03:45.300 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet everybody knows I love
 
02:03:47.450 --> 02:03:47.460 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets and uh and you look up
 
02:03:48.950 --> 02:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
Bedford and tell you exactly the number
 
02:03:51.649 --> 02:03:51.659 align:start position:0%
of students that that completed the uh
 
02:03:55.070 --> 02:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
the FAFSA cumulatively by quarter so um
 
02:03:57.109 --> 02:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
so you can you can you can find that out
 
02:03:59.209 --> 02:03:59.219 align:start position:0%
and that's all with this amendment does
 
02:04:02.629 --> 02:04:02.639 align:start position:0%
is uh is said using data reported by the
 
02:04:04.370 --> 02:04:04.380 align:start position:0%
US Department of Education Office of
 
02:04:06.470 --> 02:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
federal student financial aid for
 
02:04:09.410 --> 02:04:09.420 align:start position:0%
December 31st of the of the current
 
02:04:12.169 --> 02:04:12.179 align:start position:0%
school year so that includes current
 
02:04:14.810 --> 02:04:14.820 align:start position:0%
students who are graduating as well as
 
02:04:18.050 --> 02:04:18.060 align:start position:0%
students who had graduated in the prior
 
02:04:22.550 --> 02:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
year and um and had had applied late so
 
02:04:26.270 --> 02:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
so if that if that total number is um is
 
02:04:29.510 --> 02:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
is 80 percent then um uh then you're
 
02:04:32.629 --> 02:04:32.639 align:start position:0%
good and um and the the process
 
02:04:32.639 --> 02:04:33.890 align:start position:0%
good and um and the the process
continues

02:04:33.890 --> 02:04:33.900 align:start position:0%
continues
 
02:04:36.050 --> 02:04:36.060 align:start position:0%
um I I just also want to take a minute
 
02:04:39.229 --> 02:04:39.239 align:start position:0%
since I've got the microphone here to to
 
02:04:41.750 --> 02:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
say I just find it really hard to
 
02:04:43.850 --> 02:04:43.860 align:start position:0%
believe that that we're looking at the
 
02:04:48.290 --> 02:04:48.300 align:start position:0%
FAFSA as an as an optional equivalent to
 
02:04:50.870 --> 02:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
going on to the middle military or going
 
02:04:52.129 --> 02:04:52.139 align:start position:0%
on to
 
02:04:54.470 --> 02:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
um in into the trades or becoming an
 
02:04:57.229 --> 02:04:57.239 align:start position:0%
apprentice somewhere all the FAFSA is is
 
02:04:59.450 --> 02:04:59.460 align:start position:0%
a piece of information giving you
 
02:05:01.669 --> 02:05:01.679 align:start position:0%
something that you may not have are that
 
02:05:03.709 --> 02:05:03.719 align:start position:0%
your family may not have already known
 
02:05:07.310 --> 02:05:07.320 align:start position:0%
we all read media reports UNH really
 
02:05:09.109 --> 02:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
expensive Community College systems
 
02:05:11.330 --> 02:05:11.340 align:start position:0%
really expensive but that's different
 
02:05:14.930 --> 02:05:14.940 align:start position:0%
than can my family afford it and that's
 
02:05:17.750 --> 02:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
all the FAFSA is telling you can my
 
02:05:20.330 --> 02:05:20.340 align:start position:0%
family afford it and and if I'm
 
02:05:22.790 --> 02:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
seriously considering what do I want to
 
02:05:25.250 --> 02:05:25.260 align:start position:0%
do for my career that might be a piece
 
02:05:28.030 --> 02:05:28.040 align:start position:0%
of information that I want to consider
 
02:05:31.370 --> 02:05:31.380 align:start position:0%
if I'm considering going on to college
 
02:05:35.629 --> 02:05:35.639 align:start position:0%
or going into the military or using my
 
02:05:38.689 --> 02:05:38.699 align:start position:0%
CTE degree to uh to enter you know an
 
02:05:41.450 --> 02:05:41.460 align:start position:0%
apprentice uh ship program I might want
 
02:05:42.410 --> 02:05:42.420 align:start position:0%
to know
 
02:05:45.530 --> 02:05:45.540 align:start position:0%
if my family can afford College just as
 
02:05:47.689 --> 02:05:47.699 align:start position:0%
part of that decision tree and that's
 
02:05:51.350 --> 02:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
all the FAFSA that's all the FAFSA does
 
02:05:54.530 --> 02:05:54.540 align:start position:0%
um uh you know uh you know we've we've
 
02:05:59.330 --> 02:05:59.340 align:start position:0%
we've had politicians in the last
 
02:06:02.270 --> 02:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
I don't know seven eight years say
 
02:06:04.850 --> 02:06:04.860 align:start position:0%
ridiculous things like we love the
 
02:06:07.729 --> 02:06:07.739 align:start position:0%
uneducated and frankly my parents never
 
02:06:09.830 --> 02:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
ever said that to me and I hope none of
 
02:06:11.810 --> 02:06:11.820 align:start position:0%
your parents ever said that to you
 
02:06:15.729 --> 02:06:15.739 align:start position:0%
because that was something that was a a
 
02:06:18.709 --> 02:06:18.719 align:start position:0%
more than aspirational it was probably
 
02:06:20.689 --> 02:06:20.699 align:start position:0%
more aspirational for my family's
 
02:06:22.609 --> 02:06:22.619 align:start position:0%
generation than it was for mine because
 
02:06:25.430 --> 02:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
both my parents went to college my mom
 
02:06:27.649 --> 02:06:27.659 align:start position:0%
had Advanced degrees
 
02:06:31.010 --> 02:06:31.020 align:start position:0%
um so so there's an expectation that um
 
02:06:32.689 --> 02:06:32.699 align:start position:0%
that at least I was going to work hard
 
02:06:36.589 --> 02:06:36.599 align:start position:0%
and consider college and um and and of
 
02:06:38.689 --> 02:06:38.699 align:start position:0%
course you know it would all depend on
 
02:06:42.169 --> 02:06:42.179 align:start position:0%
on ultimately what um you know where you
 
02:06:45.950 --> 02:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
get in and what you can afford and um uh
 
02:06:47.750 --> 02:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
and you know that's an important thing
 
02:06:53.149 --> 02:06:53.159 align:start position:0%
so so I'm I'm you know I I hope as
 
02:06:56.629 --> 02:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
as a generation of current leaders in
 
02:06:58.250 --> 02:06:58.260 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and across other states
 
02:07:00.830 --> 02:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
that were not giving up on that
 
02:07:03.290 --> 02:07:03.300 align:start position:0%
aspirational ideal that you know what
 
02:07:06.189 --> 02:07:06.199 align:start position:0%
college as well as other things too
 
02:07:09.350 --> 02:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
helps people lift themselves up become
 
02:07:11.689 --> 02:07:11.699 align:start position:0%
successful and I've heard my
 
02:07:14.089 --> 02:07:14.099 align:start position:0%
constituents tell me become
 
02:07:17.330 --> 02:07:17.340 align:start position:0%
tax paying citizens uh in the United
 
02:07:19.550 --> 02:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
States in New Hampshire and in the
 
02:07:23.030 --> 02:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
United States which helps all of us and
 
02:07:26.330 --> 02:07:26.340 align:start position:0%
um and so that yeah that's what that's
 
02:07:28.790 --> 02:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
what these opportunities as opposed to
 
02:07:31.430 --> 02:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
you know other opportunities that may
 
02:07:34.609 --> 02:07:34.619 align:start position:0%
not be so so successful uh for a person
 
02:07:36.290 --> 02:07:36.300 align:start position:0%
or for a family
 
02:07:39.470 --> 02:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
um and and college is among those
 
02:07:39.480 --> 02:07:40.850 align:start position:0%
um and and college is among those
opportunities

02:07:40.850 --> 02:07:40.860 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
02:07:42.470 --> 02:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
so is military
 
02:07:45.470 --> 02:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
so is CT and apprenticeship
 
02:07:47.390 --> 02:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
um all are all are important this is
 
02:07:49.070 --> 02:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
just part of the decision-making process
 
02:07:52.550 --> 02:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
and um and all this all this amendment
 
02:07:55.189 --> 02:07:55.199 align:start position:0%
does is just provide
 
02:07:58.609 --> 02:07:58.619 align:start position:0%
um uh rewards a district and their
 
02:08:01.490 --> 02:08:01.500 align:start position:0%
students if they're making the grade and
 
02:08:04.490 --> 02:08:04.500 align:start position:0%
hitting that 80 bogey
 
02:08:07.850 --> 02:08:07.860 align:start position:0%
um uh so um so thanks very much I'm
 
02:08:09.830 --> 02:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
sorry to take up more time than than I
 
02:08:12.169 --> 02:08:12.179 align:start position:0%
thought but I'll take a question or two
 
02:08:15.589 --> 02:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
if it representative Moffett
 
02:08:18.290 --> 02:08:18.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr I I and thank you Russell
 
02:08:20.689 --> 02:08:20.699 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I have to ask and
 
02:08:22.129 --> 02:08:22.139 align:start position:0%
thank you for letting me I was trying
 
02:08:24.109 --> 02:08:24.119 align:start position:0%
not to like when we had the gifted
 
02:08:25.790 --> 02:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
student bill in here
 
02:08:28.310 --> 02:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
um which most of us recall one of the
 
02:08:30.709 --> 02:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
arguments against the gifted bill which
 
02:08:33.649 --> 02:08:33.659 align:start position:0%
is is not a law was that was an unfunded
 
02:08:36.410 --> 02:08:36.420 align:start position:0%
mandate and now especially after hearing
 
02:08:38.450 --> 02:08:38.460 align:start position:0%
the superintendents describe the
 
02:08:40.370 --> 02:08:40.380 align:start position:0%
administrative concerns they had about
 
02:08:44.390 --> 02:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
implementing the the bill that is coming
 
02:08:47.810 --> 02:08:47.820 align:start position:0%
into effect on July 1st uh wouldn't this
 
02:08:50.870 --> 02:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
be far more of an of a uh unfunded
 
02:08:54.050 --> 02:08:54.060 align:start position:0%
mandate than than the gifted report
 
02:08:55.729 --> 02:08:55.739 align:start position:0%
you know that's a that's a great
 
02:08:58.129 --> 02:08:58.139 align:start position:0%
question I mean the um the the gifted
 
02:09:01.310 --> 02:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
report not only requires the um school
 
02:09:04.370 --> 02:09:04.380 align:start position:0%
districts school districts to uh to do
 
02:09:06.470 --> 02:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
things but also requires the State
 
02:09:09.410 --> 02:09:09.420 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to do things and
 
02:09:11.570 --> 02:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
honestly I think there's there's there's
 
02:09:14.990 --> 02:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
a real open question about uh about how
 
02:09:17.209 --> 02:09:17.219 align:start position:0%
anybody is going to access these quote
 
02:09:18.830 --> 02:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
best practices or whatever they're
 
02:09:20.750 --> 02:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
called and what sort of utility they're
 
02:09:23.330 --> 02:09:23.340 align:start position:0%
going to provide provide anybody at all
 
02:09:26.629 --> 02:09:26.639 align:start position:0%
but uh but we certainly know from what
 
02:09:30.109 --> 02:09:30.119 align:start position:0%
Senator Khan had had testified to that
 
02:09:32.270 --> 02:09:32.280 align:start position:0%
where policies as the one we have in New
 
02:09:34.430 --> 02:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire comes into effect on on July
 
02:09:37.669 --> 02:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
1st what that's what what how that has
 
02:09:37.679 --> 02:09:39.290 align:start position:0%
1st what that's what what how that has
manifested

02:09:39.290 --> 02:09:39.300 align:start position:0%
manifested
 
02:09:42.410 --> 02:09:42.420 align:start position:0%
um in terms of FAFSA completion in in
 
02:09:45.770 --> 02:09:45.780 align:start position:0%
other states and information is power
 
02:09:48.770 --> 02:09:48.780 align:start position:0%
and uh and that's that's something that
 
02:09:52.070 --> 02:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
that benefits all of us and uh you know
 
02:09:53.990 --> 02:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
and I I
 
02:09:58.310 --> 02:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
empathize with with you know the um the
 
02:10:02.209 --> 02:10:02.219 align:start position:0%
the testimony that we heard from from uh
 
02:10:04.250 --> 02:10:04.260 align:start position:0%
superintendent Fournier in in Bedford
 
02:10:06.050 --> 02:10:06.060 align:start position:0%
you know when he when he's saying that
 
02:10:07.970 --> 02:10:07.980 align:start position:0%
you know what most of our families are
 
02:10:11.870 --> 02:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
already completing this but as as he
 
02:10:14.089 --> 02:10:14.099 align:start position:0%
also said he's not dealing with the same
 
02:10:16.490 --> 02:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
challenges that a lot of other districts
 
02:10:19.970 --> 02:10:19.980 align:start position:0%
across the state have and um and I like
 
02:10:21.950 --> 02:10:21.960 align:start position:0%
to say in Hopkinton and and you know
 
02:10:23.570 --> 02:10:23.580 align:start position:0%
what I was surprised I haven't heard
 
02:10:25.129 --> 02:10:25.139 align:start position:0%
anything from our school board members
 
02:10:26.930 --> 02:10:26.940 align:start position:0%
so I was surprised to hear that that
 
02:10:29.390 --> 02:10:29.400 align:start position:0%
Mike Flynn the superintendent Hopkinton
 
02:10:32.990 --> 02:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
signed on to this letter I I was at one
 
02:10:35.149 --> 02:10:35.159 align:start position:0%
of the hobn school Mel and I were at a
 
02:10:37.189 --> 02:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
school board meeting with Mike Flynn and
 
02:10:40.669 --> 02:10:40.679 align:start position:0%
the board on Tuesday nobody mentioned
 
02:10:43.250 --> 02:10:43.260 align:start position:0%
um uh this to us so I'm sort of a little
 
02:10:43.260 --> 02:10:44.629 align:start position:0%
um uh this to us so I'm sort of a little
surprised

02:10:44.629 --> 02:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
surprised
 
02:10:46.790 --> 02:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
um to to see his name on there but you
 
02:10:47.810 --> 02:10:47.820 align:start position:0%
know what
 
02:10:49.910 --> 02:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
um ask Mike Flynn ask the superintendent
 
02:10:52.430 --> 02:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
in Hopkinton how uh how school districts
 
02:10:54.830 --> 02:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
20 minutes up the road are doing
 
02:10:56.589 --> 02:10:56.599 align:start position:0%
um what's their FAFSA completion like
 
02:10:59.149 --> 02:10:59.159 align:start position:0%
what's their um what what what's what's
 
02:11:02.270 --> 02:11:02.280 align:start position:0%
Student Success like in um in their
 
02:11:04.250 --> 02:11:04.260 align:start position:0%
district and uh and I'm talking about
 
02:11:06.649 --> 02:11:06.659 align:start position:0%
Newport New Hampshire and not just from
 
02:11:09.050 --> 02:11:09.060 align:start position:0%
Newport under the bus I've interviewed
 
02:11:11.570 --> 02:11:11.580 align:start position:0%
students for MIT go you know coming from
 
02:11:14.510 --> 02:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
Newport and frankly I've told Rick and
 
02:11:16.430 --> 02:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
Mel know this that was one of the most
 
02:11:19.070 --> 02:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
amazing college interviews I've ever had
 
02:11:21.709 --> 02:11:21.719 align:start position:0%
because of what this student and their
 
02:11:24.109 --> 02:11:24.119 align:start position:0%
family had to do
 
02:11:28.010 --> 02:11:28.020 align:start position:0%
to get um to get him in a position where
 
02:11:30.050 --> 02:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
um where he could succeed and I don't
 
02:11:31.970 --> 02:11:31.980 align:start position:0%
you know I didn't follow you know the
 
02:11:33.470 --> 02:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
student afterwards
 
02:11:35.030 --> 02:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
um I do know that he did not make it
 
02:11:37.970 --> 02:11:37.980 align:start position:0%
into MIT but this kid was going to be a
 
02:11:40.129 --> 02:11:40.139 align:start position:0%
success and it was because they were
 
02:11:42.169 --> 02:11:42.179 align:start position:0%
working hard to get the best education
 
02:11:44.930 --> 02:11:44.940 align:start position:0%
for their student despite the resource
 
02:11:47.689 --> 02:11:47.699 align:start position:0%
limitations in that District so you know
 
02:11:50.169 --> 02:11:50.179 align:start position:0%
this is just something
 
02:11:54.350 --> 02:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
despite it being an unfunded mandate
 
02:11:56.810 --> 02:11:56.820 align:start position:0%
um that we're hearing is already being
 
02:11:59.390 --> 02:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
done in Woodsville and in other places
 
02:12:01.310 --> 02:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
the only thing that's not being done is
 
02:12:03.290 --> 02:12:03.300 align:start position:0%
the final check off
 
02:12:05.990 --> 02:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
and what the current statute does is
 
02:12:08.030 --> 02:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
require the check off
 
02:12:08.040 --> 02:12:09.290 align:start position:0%
require the check off
so

02:12:09.290 --> 02:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:12:09.300 --> 02:12:10.790 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:12:10.790 --> 02:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:14.629 --> 02:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:17.149 --> 02:12:17.159 align:start position:0%
where we get value from what's being
 
02:12:19.609 --> 02:12:19.619 align:start position:0%
done right now is when people attend
 
02:12:22.129 --> 02:12:22.139 align:start position:0%
when students and their families attend
 
02:12:24.890 --> 02:12:24.900 align:start position:0%
and they find out the answer
 
02:12:27.169 --> 02:12:27.179 align:start position:0%
um about whether they can they can
 
02:12:28.970 --> 02:12:28.980 align:start position:0%
afford college or not or maybe they just
 
02:12:30.290 --> 02:12:30.300 align:start position:0%
find out you know what I don't even want
 
02:12:31.850 --> 02:12:31.860 align:start position:0%
to bother trying
 
02:12:33.470 --> 02:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
I don't even want to bother trying they
 
02:12:35.030 --> 02:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
got to listen to
 
02:12:38.510 --> 02:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
um uh neef or education Talent search or
 
02:12:40.609 --> 02:12:40.619 align:start position:0%
Upward Bound or apprenticeship New
 
02:12:42.410 --> 02:12:42.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or Mike turmmel from the

02:12:44.820 --> 02:12:46.070 align:start position:0%
charitable Foundation talk about the
opportunities

02:12:46.070 --> 02:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
02:12:48.050 --> 02:12:48.060 align:start position:0%
in the context of other opportunities
 
02:12:50.629 --> 02:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
too but at least find out
 
02:12:50.639 --> 02:12:52.729 align:start position:0%
too but at least find out
and

02:12:52.729 --> 02:12:52.739 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:12:54.850 --> 02:12:54.860 align:start position:0%
all that we're talking about
 
02:12:57.709 --> 02:12:57.719 align:start position:0%
repealing here
 
02:12:59.510 --> 02:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
not in the amendment that we're looking
 
02:13:01.669 --> 02:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
at now but representative representative
 
02:13:03.050 --> 02:13:03.060 align:start position:0%
Ladd's Amendment
 
02:13:07.069 --> 02:13:07.079 align:start position:0%
is the check box and the check box is
 
02:13:09.050 --> 02:13:09.060 align:start position:0%
the essential piece of this that says
 
02:13:10.850 --> 02:13:10.860 align:start position:0%
look you at least you got to give it a
 
02:13:12.890 --> 02:13:12.900 align:start position:0%
try and you know if you really don't
 
02:13:15.530 --> 02:13:15.540 align:start position:0%
want to give a try there's a waiver
 
02:13:18.410 --> 02:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
there's there's we can attest that we at
 
02:13:19.910 --> 02:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
least offered it
 
02:13:23.810 --> 02:13:23.820 align:start position:0%
and with the 1812 Amendment or most of
 
02:13:26.209 --> 02:13:26.219 align:start position:0%
our kids are already doing it anyway and
 
02:13:28.370 --> 02:13:28.380 align:start position:0%
we've you know Senator Khan used term
 
02:13:30.050 --> 02:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
won the race
 
02:13:34.729 --> 02:13:34.739 align:start position:0%
um so so I would really hope that
 
02:13:37.490 --> 02:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
members of this committee and members of
 
02:13:41.270 --> 02:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
the House and Senate will recognize what
 
02:13:44.510 --> 02:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
we put into law a couple years ago
 
02:13:44.520 --> 02:13:46.010 align:start position:0%
we put into law a couple years ago
and

02:13:46.010 --> 02:13:46.020 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:13:47.870 --> 02:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
give it a chance
 
02:13:52.250 --> 02:13:52.260 align:start position:0%
to run itself out give it a try see what
 
02:13:55.310 --> 02:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
happens we can find out right away from
 
02:13:57.589 --> 02:13:57.599 align:start position:0%
the federal student aid website how
 
02:13:59.030 --> 02:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
that's manifesting in terms of
 
02:14:00.950 --> 02:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
completion numbers you don't even need
 
02:14:02.330 --> 02:14:02.340 align:start position:0%
to wait for principals to report
 
02:14:05.149 --> 02:14:05.159 align:start position:0%
anything or or um or anything like that
 
02:14:06.770 --> 02:14:06.780 align:start position:0%
you can look it up you can find it we
 
02:14:09.109 --> 02:14:09.119 align:start position:0%
can find it out ourselves but let's just
 
02:14:12.050 --> 02:14:12.060 align:start position:0%
give it a try and and uh sorry about the
 
02:14:15.189 --> 02:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
long answer representative Moffett but
 
02:14:16.910 --> 02:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:14:20.510 --> 02:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
but there we go represent cordelli thank
 
02:14:21.890 --> 02:14:21.900 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um thank you
 
02:14:25.010 --> 02:14:25.020 align:start position:0%
representative maybe you can correct my
 
02:14:27.229 --> 02:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
understanding of what this amendment
 
02:14:31.010 --> 02:14:31.020 align:start position:0%
says I'm looking at lines 11 through 14
 
02:14:32.649 --> 02:14:32.659 align:start position:0%
in particular
 
02:14:35.270 --> 02:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
the school district shell award a
 
02:14:38.330 --> 02:14:38.340 align:start position:0%
diploma to the student and I take it it
 
02:14:41.030 --> 02:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
means whose parents did not complete the
 
02:14:44.149 --> 02:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
requirements of paragraph one which is
 
02:14:46.970 --> 02:14:46.980 align:start position:0%
the waiver or the completion of the
 
02:14:49.069 --> 02:14:49.079 align:start position:0%
FAFSA great
 
02:14:49.079 --> 02:14:50.689 align:start position:0%
FAFSA great
um

02:14:50.689 --> 02:14:50.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:53.689 --> 02:14:53.699 align:start position:0%
on two conditions first that the student
 
02:14:56.629 --> 02:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
has met all the graduation requirements
 
02:14:58.850 --> 02:14:58.860 align:start position:0%
secondly and
 
02:15:03.169 --> 02:15:03.179 align:start position:0%
on line 12 and the completion rate
 
02:15:05.510 --> 02:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
for that high school is at least 80
 
02:15:05.520 --> 02:15:06.490 align:start position:0%
for that high school is at least 80
percent

02:15:06.490 --> 02:15:06.500 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:15:09.830 --> 02:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
so if the completion rate is not 80
 
02:15:12.410 --> 02:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
percent does that mean that the student
 
02:15:15.050 --> 02:15:15.060 align:start position:0%
cannot get that high school graduation
 
02:15:17.089 --> 02:15:17.099 align:start position:0%
award no one of thank you for the
 
02:15:19.010 --> 02:15:19.020 align:start position:0%
question Representative cordelli no uh
 
02:15:21.229 --> 02:15:21.239 align:start position:0%
one of the other exemptions would would
 
02:15:25.010 --> 02:15:25.020 align:start position:0%
have to have to uh or sorry one of the
 
02:15:29.209 --> 02:15:29.219 align:start position:0%
other three mechanisms for for complying
 
02:15:30.649 --> 02:15:30.659 align:start position:0%
with the with the with the current
 
02:15:32.870 --> 02:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
statute would have to be true either
 
02:15:34.609 --> 02:15:34.619 align:start position:0%
completing the FAFSA
 
02:15:37.010 --> 02:15:37.020 align:start position:0%
or filling out a waiver
 
02:15:40.910 --> 02:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
or the principal attesting that the
 
02:15:43.790 --> 02:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
school has made a good faith effort to
 
02:15:47.030 --> 02:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh to Pro provide information to on on
 
02:15:49.609 --> 02:15:49.619 align:start position:0%
on the FAFSA so any of those three
 
02:15:52.370 --> 02:15:52.380 align:start position:0%
things the this one is introducing a
 
02:15:52.380 --> 02:15:53.689 align:start position:0%
things the this one is introducing a
fourth

02:15:53.689 --> 02:15:53.699 align:start position:0%
fourth
 
02:15:53.699 --> 02:15:54.290 align:start position:0%
fourth
um

02:15:54.290 --> 02:15:54.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:57.890 --> 02:15:57.900 align:start position:0%
saying that that and I think
 
02:16:00.350 --> 02:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli characterized it
 
02:16:03.649 --> 02:16:03.659 align:start position:0%
um perfectly well that uh that that if
 
02:16:06.649 --> 02:16:06.659 align:start position:0%
the school district is already if FAFSA
 
02:16:08.750 --> 02:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
completion in the school district is
 
02:16:11.209 --> 02:16:11.219 align:start position:0%
already at 80 percent
 
02:16:13.729 --> 02:16:13.739 align:start position:0%
um then um then then the principal can
 
02:16:16.729 --> 02:16:16.739 align:start position:0%
attest to that and all the students are
 
02:16:20.390 --> 02:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
have will have met this requirement
 
02:16:21.830 --> 02:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
um obviously they have to meet other
 
02:16:23.990 --> 02:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
graduation requirements in there and and
 
02:16:26.750 --> 02:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
the the language in Roman three is
 
02:16:30.290 --> 02:16:30.300 align:start position:0%
lifted from the other two ex you know
 
02:16:32.150 --> 02:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
there's the paths of completion which
 
02:16:33.709 --> 02:16:33.719 align:start position:0%
also says you have to complete all of
 
02:16:35.929 --> 02:16:35.939 align:start position:0%
your other graduation requirements the
 
02:16:37.730 --> 02:16:37.740 align:start position:0%
waiver and you have to complete it all
 
02:16:40.370 --> 02:16:40.380 align:start position:0%
your other graduate requirements and the
 
02:16:42.349 --> 02:16:42.359 align:start position:0%
school has provided the opportunity and
 
02:16:44.629 --> 02:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
information and you have already you
 
02:16:46.250 --> 02:16:46.260 align:start position:0%
know met all the other graduation
 
02:16:46.260 --> 02:16:47.929 align:start position:0%
know met all the other graduation
requirements

02:16:47.929 --> 02:16:47.939 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
02:16:50.270 --> 02:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you
 
02:16:53.570 --> 02:16:53.580 align:start position:0%
um yeah I think maybe this
 
02:16:55.810 --> 02:16:55.820 align:start position:0%
um conflict between
 
02:16:58.969 --> 02:16:58.979 align:start position:0%
paragraph two which says that the
 
02:17:02.089 --> 02:17:02.099 align:start position:0%
principal can attest to they try to get
 
02:17:04.310 --> 02:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
the fast and FAFSA
 
02:17:09.410 --> 02:17:09.420 align:start position:0%
um uh completion rate up and um uh so
 
02:17:09.420 --> 02:17:10.669 align:start position:0%
um uh completion rate up and um uh so
forth

02:17:10.669 --> 02:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
forth
 
02:17:10.679 --> 02:17:11.690 align:start position:0%
forth
um

02:17:11.690 --> 02:17:11.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:14.810 --> 02:17:14.820 align:start position:0%
that says that if they do attest to that
 
02:17:17.089 --> 02:17:17.099 align:start position:0%
the student can get a Graduation
 
02:17:20.270 --> 02:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
requirement right but this is paragraph
 
02:17:22.190 --> 02:17:22.200 align:start position:0%
three that says
 
02:17:24.169 --> 02:17:24.179 align:start position:0%
the student cannot get a Graduation
 
02:17:24.179 --> 02:17:25.429 align:start position:0%
the student cannot get a Graduation
requirement

02:17:25.429 --> 02:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
02:17:29.450 --> 02:17:29.460 align:start position:0%
if the completion rate is less than 80
 
02:17:31.730 --> 02:17:31.740 align:start position:0%
percent so I think there's a conflict
 
02:17:34.610 --> 02:17:34.620 align:start position:0%
between paragraphs two in the existing
 
02:17:37.009 --> 02:17:37.019 align:start position:0%
law and paragraph three here in this
 
02:17:37.019 --> 02:17:38.629 align:start position:0%
law and paragraph three here in this
amendment

02:17:38.629 --> 02:17:38.639 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:17:44.270 --> 02:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
no no this this says um paragraph two so
 
02:17:46.490 --> 02:17:46.500 align:start position:0%
um my apologies to the members in the
 
02:17:49.070 --> 02:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
committee uh this is an amendment it
 
02:17:50.990 --> 02:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't have what what represented
 
02:17:53.509 --> 02:17:53.519 align:start position:0%
cordelli is looking at but paragraph two
 
02:17:55.730 --> 02:17:55.740 align:start position:0%
if I were
 
02:17:58.669 --> 02:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
let me step back the statute currently
 
02:18:01.190 --> 02:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
has two paragraphs a Roman one and a
 
02:18:05.089 --> 02:18:05.099 align:start position:0%
Roman two a Roman one says all students
 
02:18:07.610 --> 02:18:07.620 align:start position:0%
must either as as part of a graduation
 
02:18:10.429 --> 02:18:10.439 align:start position:0%
requirement complete the FAFSA or
 
02:18:12.290 --> 02:18:12.300 align:start position:0%
complete a waiver right
 
02:18:16.429 --> 02:18:16.439 align:start position:0%
paragraph Roman 2 says that if a student
 
02:18:18.290 --> 02:18:18.300 align:start position:0%
has failed to meet
 
02:18:20.209 --> 02:18:20.219 align:start position:0%
the the
 
02:18:23.150 --> 02:18:23.160 align:start position:0%
um the requirements of paragraph Roman
 
02:18:26.870 --> 02:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
one that the principal can attest that
 
02:18:29.150 --> 02:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
that and I'm I'm I don't remember the
 
02:18:31.370 --> 02:18:31.380 align:start position:0%
exact word good faith efforts have been
 
02:18:33.709 --> 02:18:33.719 align:start position:0%
made to provide information to students
 
02:18:35.929 --> 02:18:35.939 align:start position:0%
and their families with respect to FAFSA
 
02:18:37.429 --> 02:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
completion did I sort of characterize
 
02:18:40.009 --> 02:18:40.019 align:start position:0%
that pretty closely and then and and and
 
02:18:42.889 --> 02:18:42.899 align:start position:0%
that and that the the principle can
 
02:18:46.070 --> 02:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
attest to that provided the student has
 
02:18:47.330 --> 02:18:47.340 align:start position:0%
met all the other graduation
 
02:18:50.389 --> 02:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
requirements and then paragraph three is
 
02:18:54.110 --> 02:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
a sen is taking another step saying
 
02:18:58.190 --> 02:18:58.200 align:start position:0%
saying if the student has not been able
 
02:18:59.450 --> 02:18:59.460 align:start position:0%
to meet the requirements of paragraph
 
02:19:01.790 --> 02:19:01.800 align:start position:0%
one which is complete the FAFSA or
 
02:19:03.049 --> 02:19:03.059 align:start position:0%
provide a waiver
 
02:19:06.830 --> 02:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
then and and the
 
02:19:09.410 --> 02:19:09.420 align:start position:0%
um the uh the principal
 
02:19:13.429 --> 02:19:13.439 align:start position:0%
has can attest that 80 percent
 
02:19:14.990 --> 02:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
um there's that there's an eighty
 
02:19:17.810 --> 02:19:17.820 align:start position:0%
percent FAFSA completion rate in their
 
02:19:21.169 --> 02:19:21.179 align:start position:0%
in their school and that the student has
 
02:19:23.089 --> 02:19:23.099 align:start position:0%
met all of the graduation requirements
 
02:19:26.270 --> 02:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
then then the student can graduate it's
 
02:19:29.150 --> 02:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
it's mirrored the language from from
 
02:19:32.270 --> 02:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
paragraph two uh which is the
 
02:19:35.629 --> 02:19:35.639 align:start position:0%
alternative to the FAFSA and waiver
 
02:19:38.870 --> 02:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
that provides and with this amendment it
 
02:19:42.230 --> 02:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
would provide four mechanisms for um uh
 
02:19:44.270 --> 02:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
for a student to to graduate in
 
02:19:46.009 --> 02:19:46.019 align:start position:0%
compliance with the
 
02:19:48.770 --> 02:19:48.780 align:start position:0%
um the FAFSA statute
 
02:19:51.889 --> 02:19:51.899 align:start position:0%
further questions yes represent grassy
 
02:19:54.710 --> 02:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
so just to make it quick if what I'm
 
02:19:57.170 --> 02:19:57.180 align:start position:0%
understanding here is that if they meet
 
02:19:59.090 --> 02:19:59.100 align:start position:0%
the requirements of 80 all the other
 
02:20:00.830 --> 02:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
requirements are waived other than your
 
02:20:03.170 --> 02:20:03.180 align:start position:0%
academic congratulations correct you've
 
02:20:06.290 --> 02:20:06.300 align:start position:0%
satisfied the FAFSA required yeah
 
02:20:08.570 --> 02:20:08.580 align:start position:0%
for the questions
 
02:20:11.330 --> 02:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
represent Lucas
 
02:20:13.429 --> 02:20:13.439 align:start position:0%
can you explain to me what's Magic about
 
02:20:16.550 --> 02:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
80 percent and why if 80 of your kids
 
02:20:18.590 --> 02:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
did it then
 
02:20:21.290 --> 02:20:21.300 align:start position:0%
then it doesn't matter
 
02:20:22.849 --> 02:20:22.859 align:start position:0%
um yeah I mean that's a that's a really
 
02:20:25.490 --> 02:20:25.500 align:start position:0%
good question when when um when current
 
02:20:28.429 --> 02:20:28.439 align:start position:0%
FAFSA completion Statewide uh is at
 
02:20:30.650 --> 02:20:30.660 align:start position:0%
around 50 I believe that's what Senator
 
02:20:36.469 --> 02:20:36.479 align:start position:0%
Khan uh um testified to and that has a
 
02:20:39.950 --> 02:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
range all over the state from well below
 
02:20:42.469 --> 02:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
50 percent to well above eight uh 50
 
02:20:46.270 --> 02:20:46.280 align:start position:0%
including at 80 percent or above that um
 
02:20:49.550 --> 02:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
that that 80 percent isn't isn't
 
02:20:51.710 --> 02:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
attainable number
 
02:20:54.290 --> 02:20:54.300 align:start position:0%
um uh in a lot of districts that it is
 
02:20:57.050 --> 02:20:57.060 align:start position:0%
an aspirational number for many
 
02:21:00.309 --> 02:21:00.319 align:start position:0%
districts whose students are not even
 
02:21:02.690 --> 02:21:02.700 align:start position:0%
completing taking a look at completing
 
02:21:06.830 --> 02:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
the uh the FAFSA but from what what has
 
02:21:09.230 --> 02:21:09.240 align:start position:0%
been witnessed in other states Texas
 
02:21:11.929 --> 02:21:11.939 align:start position:0%
Illinois and Louisiana that they have
 
02:21:14.809 --> 02:21:14.819 align:start position:0%
seen Statewide completion Statewide
 
02:21:17.210 --> 02:21:17.220 align:start position:0%
completion numbers go above 70 percent
 
02:21:19.849 --> 02:21:19.859 align:start position:0%
with most districts or many districts
 
02:21:22.550 --> 02:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
getting above 80 percent
 
02:21:24.590 --> 02:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
um that uh that that that that that
 
02:21:27.349 --> 02:21:27.359 align:start position:0%
seems like a reasonable number
 
02:21:29.450 --> 02:21:29.460 align:start position:0%
um you know in terms of in terms of
 
02:21:32.389 --> 02:21:32.399 align:start position:0%
looking at at good achievement rates and
 
02:21:34.610 --> 02:21:34.620 align:start position:0%
it's certainly a number that that puts
 
02:21:39.889 --> 02:21:39.899 align:start position:0%
the state a above our our the targeted
 
02:21:43.490 --> 02:21:43.500 align:start position:0%
goal of 65 by 25 when uh when when
 
02:21:43.500 --> 02:21:44.630 align:start position:0%
goal of 65 by 25 when uh when when
current

02:21:44.630 --> 02:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
current
 
02:21:48.650 --> 02:21:48.660 align:start position:0%
um uh higher education attainment is um
 
02:21:51.290 --> 02:21:51.300 align:start position:0%
I I don't know what the current
 
02:21:53.450 --> 02:21:53.460 align:start position:0%
um uh percentage is in New Hampshire I
 
02:21:56.990 --> 02:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
think it's in the low 50s low 50 uh
 
02:22:00.710 --> 02:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
percent it was 49 a few years ago and
 
02:22:02.990 --> 02:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
now it's now it's right around 50 or 51
 
02:22:05.330 --> 02:22:05.340 align:start position:0%
percent so so it puts us in the right
 
02:22:07.490 --> 02:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
direction to get there
 
02:22:11.030 --> 02:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
if if in fact the student that's the
 
02:22:13.370 --> 02:22:13.380 align:start position:0%
high school student has met all
 
02:22:15.530 --> 02:22:15.540 align:start position:0%
disciplinary type requirements nothing
 
02:22:15.540 --> 02:22:16.730 align:start position:0%
disciplinary type requirements nothing
there

02:22:16.730 --> 02:22:16.740 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:22:20.450 --> 02:22:20.460 align:start position:0%
all course requirements for graduation
 
02:22:22.969 --> 02:22:22.979 align:start position:0%
why should the student not be allowed to
 
02:22:27.050 --> 02:22:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:27.060 --> 02:22:28.330 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:22:28.330 --> 02:22:28.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:31.010 --> 02:22:31.020 align:start position:0%
that's that's a that's a really good
 
02:22:33.290 --> 02:22:33.300 align:start position:0%
question and and I think there's there's
 
02:22:35.510 --> 02:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of other things that that
 
02:22:38.389 --> 02:22:38.399 align:start position:0%
contribute to whether or not a student
 
02:22:38.399 --> 02:22:40.130 align:start position:0%
contribute to whether or not a student
graduates

02:22:40.130 --> 02:22:40.140 align:start position:0%
graduates
 
02:22:42.230 --> 02:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
um from from high school including the
 
02:22:44.570 --> 02:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
student's ability to attend the students
 
02:22:47.630 --> 02:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
ability to be there and learn and in
 
02:22:50.090 --> 02:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
this case it's um it's a student's
 
02:22:52.849 --> 02:22:52.859 align:start position:0%
financial literacy in in understanding
 
02:22:55.309 --> 02:22:55.319 align:start position:0%
what their um what their what
 
02:22:57.889 --> 02:22:57.899 align:start position:0%
opportunities they may have in terms of
 
02:23:01.070 --> 02:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
affording higher education and and um
 
02:23:03.710 --> 02:23:03.720 align:start position:0%
and and
 
02:23:08.929 --> 02:23:08.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:11.030 --> 02:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
as a society
 
02:23:12.710 --> 02:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
whether that's the state of New
 
02:23:15.469 --> 02:23:15.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in our economy or the the uh
 
02:23:19.309 --> 02:23:19.319 align:start position:0%
the the you know our country as a whole
 
02:23:23.469 --> 02:23:23.479 align:start position:0%
um we we base a number of policies on on
 
02:23:26.870 --> 02:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
policy priorities that that we want to
 
02:23:30.230 --> 02:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
see and and for instance one of them was
 
02:23:33.170 --> 02:23:33.180 align:start position:0%
um years ago certainly way before my
 
02:23:36.110 --> 02:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
time was uh was home ownership and how
 
02:23:38.389 --> 02:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
home ownership was going to help expand
 
02:23:40.670 --> 02:23:40.680 align:start position:0%
the middle class and provide greater
 
02:23:42.889 --> 02:23:42.899 align:start position:0%
wealth opportunities for people all
 
02:23:44.990 --> 02:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
across the countries and one of the ways
 
02:23:46.969 --> 02:23:46.979 align:start position:0%
the United States
 
02:23:51.230 --> 02:23:51.240 align:start position:0%
um uh provided a strong policy for home
 
02:23:54.170 --> 02:23:54.180 align:start position:0%
ownership was to provide the um the
 
02:23:55.330 --> 02:23:55.340 align:start position:0%
mortgage interest
 
02:23:59.450 --> 02:23:59.460 align:start position:0%
tax deduction and um and that opened a
 
02:24:02.150 --> 02:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
lot of doors for uh for people
 
02:24:04.130 --> 02:24:04.140 align:start position:0%
um is it a good policy yeah I think home
 
02:24:05.750 --> 02:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
ownership in the United States is a
 
02:24:07.250 --> 02:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
really good policy and when we see
 
02:24:11.330 --> 02:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
policies that that break that down or or
 
02:24:15.410 --> 02:24:15.420 align:start position:0%
erode uh that then um then we get into
 
02:24:17.570 --> 02:24:17.580 align:start position:0%
situations where where we're taking a
 
02:24:20.929 --> 02:24:20.939 align:start position:0%
step back and uh in this case
 
02:24:23.809 --> 02:24:23.819 align:start position:0%
you know taking it we we hear all the
 
02:24:25.849 --> 02:24:25.859 align:start position:0%
time it's being debated at the federal
 
02:24:28.309 --> 02:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
level right now in terms of um work
 
02:24:30.830 --> 02:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
requirements associated with the the new
 
02:24:33.290 --> 02:24:33.300 align:start position:0%
federal budget compromise uh along with
 
02:24:38.150 --> 02:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
the um the um debt ceiling uh limit and
 
02:24:40.429 --> 02:24:40.439 align:start position:0%
uh and we're hearing people say well you
 
02:24:43.910 --> 02:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
know what people need to be working hard
 
02:24:46.070 --> 02:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
they need to be taking initiative on
 
02:24:47.270 --> 02:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
their own they need to be doing
 
02:24:49.790 --> 02:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
something to improve their own success
 
02:24:52.429 --> 02:24:52.439 align:start position:0%
in their own lives as opposed to relying
 
02:24:55.490 --> 02:24:55.500 align:start position:0%
on um on us to do it and I'm just sort
 
02:24:57.230 --> 02:24:57.240 align:start position:0%
of paraphrasing some things I think I've
 
02:24:59.630 --> 02:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
heard in the news and um and completing
 
02:25:01.309 --> 02:25:01.319 align:start position:0%
the FAFSA is another one of those things
 
02:25:04.849 --> 02:25:04.859 align:start position:0%
it may help to dispel
 
02:25:04.859 --> 02:25:05.469 align:start position:0%
it may help to dispel
um

02:25:05.469 --> 02:25:05.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:09.530 --> 02:25:09.540 align:start position:0%
a misinterpretation or or or bad
 
02:25:11.870 --> 02:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
information that that or a bad
 
02:25:13.130 --> 02:25:13.140 align:start position:0%
assumption I don't say bad information
 
02:25:15.349 --> 02:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
but a bad assumption maybe that bad
 
02:25:17.090 --> 02:25:17.100 align:start position:0%
assumption is you know what my family
 
02:25:19.309 --> 02:25:19.319 align:start position:0%
can't afford College maybe that's a bad
 
02:25:21.650 --> 02:25:21.660 align:start position:0%
assumption why is that well because I
 
02:25:23.450 --> 02:25:23.460 align:start position:0%
read all the time I see all the time
 
02:25:25.910 --> 02:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
that that the state of New Hampshire
 
02:25:28.490 --> 02:25:28.500 align:start position:0%
doesn't contribute enough towards the
 
02:25:30.230 --> 02:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
the university system in New Hampshire
 
02:25:31.790 --> 02:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
enough State funds to the university
 
02:25:33.410 --> 02:25:33.420 align:start position:0%
system New Hampshire or the Community
 
02:25:35.450 --> 02:25:35.460 align:start position:0%
College of New Hampshire and both those
 
02:25:37.849 --> 02:25:37.859 align:start position:0%
institutions have among the highest uh
 
02:25:40.610 --> 02:25:40.620 align:start position:0%
tuition rates in the country there's no
 
02:25:43.010 --> 02:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
way no way my family is going to be able
 
02:25:45.230 --> 02:25:45.240 align:start position:0%
to afford me to go to college or that
 
02:25:47.630 --> 02:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be able to go to college on
 
02:25:50.090 --> 02:25:50.100 align:start position:0%
the um the the hourly rate that I make
 
02:25:53.990 --> 02:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
bagging groceries at uh demoulas and um
 
02:25:56.150 --> 02:25:56.160 align:start position:0%
and uh and I'm not saying anything
 
02:25:58.690 --> 02:25:58.700 align:start position:0%
negative on demolis
 
02:26:02.330 --> 02:26:02.340 align:start position:0%
let me finish this but but but this is
 
02:26:04.550 --> 02:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
going to give new information to people
 
02:26:07.670 --> 02:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
you know and that that may have been
 
02:26:10.849 --> 02:26:10.859 align:start position:0%
operating Under a Bad assumption that
 
02:26:13.730 --> 02:26:13.740 align:start position:0%
that college was was closed off to them
 
02:26:15.650 --> 02:26:15.660 align:start position:0%
and and
 
02:26:18.590 --> 02:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
you look at a lot of colleges and you
 
02:26:21.050 --> 02:26:21.060 align:start position:0%
know again I'm thinking back to um and I
 
02:26:22.429 --> 02:26:22.439 align:start position:0%
don't know I certainly don't know the
 
02:26:24.830 --> 02:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
financial situation of the student I'd
 
02:26:26.990 --> 02:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned up in up in Newport applying
 
02:26:28.969 --> 02:26:28.979 align:start position:0%
to MIT but
 
02:26:31.429 --> 02:26:31.439 align:start position:0%
first and family
 
02:26:33.590 --> 02:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
um College acceptance is a really
 
02:26:36.710 --> 02:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:38.990 --> 02:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
um you know I think it'd be it was
 
02:26:41.270 --> 02:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
probably important for their family but
 
02:26:43.070 --> 02:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
I think it's important for us as a
 
02:26:46.730 --> 02:26:46.740 align:start position:0%
country too because once um
 
02:26:51.050 --> 02:26:51.060 align:start position:0%
once that Band-Aid is is how are we how
 
02:26:53.570 --> 02:26:53.580 align:start position:0%
do we talk about it earlier once that
 
02:26:57.770 --> 02:26:57.780 align:start position:0%
once that cycle is broken then future
 
02:27:01.070 --> 02:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
Generations do go to college and and um
 
02:27:04.490 --> 02:27:04.500 align:start position:0%
or do attain post-secondary
 
02:27:06.650 --> 02:27:06.660 align:start position:0%
um certificates and are in the workforce
 
02:27:08.990 --> 02:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
and are paying taxes and are successful
 
02:27:10.790 --> 02:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
and they raise families and just like
 
02:27:13.969 --> 02:27:13.979 align:start position:0%
what Senator Khan said it's good for the
 
02:27:15.830 --> 02:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
economy it's good for families and it's
 
02:27:18.830 --> 02:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
good for the workforce and and we don't
 
02:27:22.250 --> 02:27:22.260 align:start position:0%
all have to agree that that staying on
 
02:27:24.889 --> 02:27:24.899 align:start position:0%
getting associates degree from nhci were
 
02:27:26.870 --> 02:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
will representative Moffett has has
 
02:27:28.610 --> 02:27:28.620 align:start position:0%
taught for many years where I serve on
 
02:27:29.690 --> 02:27:29.700 align:start position:0%
the board
 
02:27:32.150 --> 02:27:32.160 align:start position:0%
um is necessarily the right thing for
 
02:27:34.370 --> 02:27:34.380 align:start position:0%
everybody nor is going to UNH nor is
 
02:27:37.790 --> 02:27:37.800 align:start position:0%
going to MIT or or any other things but
 
02:27:40.370 --> 02:27:40.380 align:start position:0%
understanding what my options are is
 
02:27:44.389 --> 02:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
huge is of huge importance and and when
 
02:27:46.070 --> 02:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
you're when you're basing it on
 
02:27:49.190 --> 02:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
assumptions it's not good and especially
 
02:27:52.010 --> 02:27:52.020 align:start position:0%
the assumptions that that that could be
 
02:27:54.050 --> 02:27:54.060 align:start position:0%
created based on you know the
 
02:27:56.150 --> 02:27:56.160 align:start position:0%
information here in New Hampshire on on
 
02:27:58.370 --> 02:27:58.380 align:start position:0%
College tuition
 
02:28:02.150 --> 02:28:02.160 align:start position:0%
um uh you know I I was I was surprised I
 
02:28:04.130 --> 02:28:04.140 align:start position:0%
mean I've been on the nhti board for I
 
02:28:07.370 --> 02:28:07.380 align:start position:0%
think close to 25 years and and when
 
02:28:09.830 --> 02:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
Senator Khan said and I wrote it down
 
02:28:12.950 --> 02:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
that um that the Community College of
 
02:28:16.130 --> 02:28:16.140 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire can be at no cost
 
02:28:18.530 --> 02:28:18.540 align:start position:0%
to people who qualify for Pell and
 
02:28:20.150 --> 02:28:20.160 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely true I've always known
 
02:28:23.090 --> 02:28:23.100 align:start position:0%
that but I never really connected
 
02:28:25.849 --> 02:28:25.859 align:start position:0%
um that that that you know what I don't
 
02:28:28.070 --> 02:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
know if I qualify for Pell unless I fill
 
02:28:30.050 --> 02:28:30.060 align:start position:0%
out the FAFSA
 
02:28:31.309 --> 02:28:31.319 align:start position:0%
and then when I find out my family
 
02:28:34.010 --> 02:28:34.020 align:start position:0%
qualifies Propel wow
 
02:28:35.750 --> 02:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire community colleges are
 
02:28:35.760 --> 02:28:37.790 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire community colleges are
free

02:28:37.790 --> 02:28:37.800 align:start position:0%
free
 
02:28:40.490 --> 02:28:40.500 align:start position:0%
so that's why
 
02:28:44.570 --> 02:28:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:46.070 --> 02:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
a student
 
02:28:49.130 --> 02:28:49.140 align:start position:0%
not complying with paragraph one
 
02:28:52.610 --> 02:28:52.620 align:start position:0%
schools FAFSA record fifty percent sixty
 
02:28:54.590 --> 02:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
percent below 80 percent
 
02:28:57.710 --> 02:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
student received early admission
 
02:29:01.130 --> 02:29:01.140 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the senior year
 
02:29:03.950 --> 02:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
is that student not going to graduate
 
02:29:07.550 --> 02:29:07.560 align:start position:0%
no no no the the the student will either
 
02:29:07.560 --> 02:29:08.990 align:start position:0%
no no no the the the student will either
get

02:29:08.990 --> 02:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
get
 
02:29:11.929 --> 02:29:11.939 align:start position:0%
um either have a waiver from their
 
02:29:14.450 --> 02:29:14.460 align:start position:0%
family or not participating at all okay
 
02:29:18.230 --> 02:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
or or the principal says you know what
 
02:29:21.530 --> 02:29:21.540 align:start position:0%
we did just fine for this and and you
 
02:29:23.630 --> 02:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
know we provided the information the
 
02:29:25.790 --> 02:29:25.800 align:start position:0%
information that that you've got on
 
02:29:28.190 --> 02:29:28.200 align:start position:0%
there that in your in in your Amendment
 
02:29:30.950 --> 02:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative blood that um that that
 
02:29:34.370 --> 02:29:34.380 align:start position:0%
has been provided so uh to the to the
 
02:29:36.950 --> 02:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
student and their family so yes that
 
02:29:39.469 --> 02:29:39.479 align:start position:0%
student is going to graduate we have no
 
02:29:41.270 --> 02:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
information Senator can't talk to those
 
02:29:43.610 --> 02:29:43.620 align:start position:0%
no information of students being denied
 
02:29:46.550 --> 02:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
graduation but having this stick out
 
02:29:50.690 --> 02:29:50.700 align:start position:0%
there has compels more families to at
 
02:29:54.290 --> 02:29:54.300 align:start position:0%
least find out the answer to um uh to
 
02:29:56.929 --> 02:29:56.939 align:start position:0%
this and and you know that we're we're
 
02:30:00.290 --> 02:30:00.300 align:start position:0%
not I mean I know New Hampshire other
 
02:30:03.170 --> 02:30:03.180 align:start position:0%
than other than the primary we don't
 
02:30:05.150 --> 02:30:05.160 align:start position:0%
like to be the first in the nation on
 
02:30:07.190 --> 02:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
much and we're not the first in the
 
02:30:09.230 --> 02:30:09.240 align:start position:0%
nation on this one either there's at
 
02:30:11.630 --> 02:30:11.640 align:start position:0%
least four states that that have done
 
02:30:14.870 --> 02:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
this for years now and um and you know
 
02:30:17.630 --> 02:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
it'll be sort of you know lay it out
 
02:30:20.630 --> 02:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
yeah these are red states too and
 
02:30:23.450 --> 02:30:23.460 align:start position:0%
they're seeing good things as a as a
 
02:30:25.969 --> 02:30:25.979 align:start position:0%
result of um as a result of the policy
 
02:30:30.110 --> 02:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
as we have it on the books right now
 
02:30:32.870 --> 02:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
um uh no the student's not going to be
 
02:30:35.210 --> 02:30:35.220 align:start position:0%
denied uh graduation if the student
 
02:30:37.670 --> 02:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
hasn't completed the FAFSA I'm I'm
 
02:30:40.429 --> 02:30:40.439 align:start position:0%
surprised that they uh that they
 
02:30:41.870 --> 02:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily completed a college
 
02:30:43.610 --> 02:30:43.620 align:start position:0%
application I mean I'm not I'm not
 
02:30:46.070 --> 02:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
saying it doesn't happen but I I think
 
02:30:48.710 --> 02:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
the the you know the other part of the
 
02:30:52.610 --> 02:30:52.620 align:start position:0%
the sort of the the connection here is
 
02:30:55.490 --> 02:30:55.500 align:start position:0%
is if you don't complete the FAFSA
 
02:30:58.910 --> 02:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
you're not you're you're not completing
 
02:31:00.710 --> 02:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
college applications either whether
 
02:31:03.290 --> 02:31:03.300 align:start position:0%
that's the the the
 
02:31:05.830 --> 02:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
um the the
 
02:31:08.990 --> 02:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
automatic application that that you can
 
02:31:11.510 --> 02:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
have for Community College or if it's an
 
02:31:13.250 --> 02:31:13.260 align:start position:0%
application at Dartmouth where you've
 
02:31:13.260 --> 02:31:13.969 align:start position:0%
application at Dartmouth where you've
got

02:31:13.969 --> 02:31:13.979 align:start position:0%
got
 
02:31:17.590 --> 02:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
um a uh you know where you're in early
 
02:31:25.010 --> 02:31:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:26.809 --> 02:31:26.819 align:start position:0%
yeah and there there may be some people
 
02:31:29.270 --> 02:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
that that
 
02:31:34.730 --> 02:31:34.740 align:start position:0%
live in some towns across the state that
 
02:31:38.210 --> 02:31:38.220 align:start position:0%
recognize the situation that they're in
 
02:31:40.490 --> 02:31:40.500 align:start position:0%
where there's where there's a tremendous
 
02:31:42.889 --> 02:31:42.899 align:start position:0%
amount of family money and there's no
 
02:31:45.170 --> 02:31:45.180 align:start position:0%
way I'm going to be getting
 
02:31:47.630 --> 02:31:47.640 align:start position:0%
um financial assistance it's going to be
 
02:31:49.910 --> 02:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
expected that my family contributes 100
 
02:31:53.389 --> 02:31:53.399 align:start position:0%
percent but that's not a that's not why
 
02:31:56.270 --> 02:31:56.280 align:start position:0%
the statue is on the books right now and
 
02:31:58.670 --> 02:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
it's not why we're doing this
 
02:31:58.680 --> 02:31:59.870 align:start position:0%
it's not why we're doing this
um

02:31:59.870 --> 02:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:02.870 --> 02:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I want uh I want those kids to go
 
02:32:04.849 --> 02:32:04.859 align:start position:0%
on and be successful too
 
02:32:07.550 --> 02:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
but but I'm less worried about those
 
02:32:10.070 --> 02:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
kids than I am
 
02:32:11.990 --> 02:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
um you know the kid in Newport
 
02:32:14.750 --> 02:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
and and making sure that
 
02:32:14.760 --> 02:32:16.790 align:start position:0%
and and making sure that
that

02:32:16.790 --> 02:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:32:20.150 --> 02:32:20.160 align:start position:0%
they complete the FAFSA they know Eyes
 
02:32:22.690 --> 02:32:22.700 align:start position:0%
Wide Open what they
 
02:32:25.490 --> 02:32:25.500 align:start position:0%
what their opportunities are whether
 
02:32:26.690 --> 02:32:26.700 align:start position:0%
it's College whether it's military
 
02:32:28.550 --> 02:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
whether that's apprenticeship whether
 
02:32:28.560 --> 02:32:29.690 align:start position:0%
whether that's apprenticeship whether
that's

02:32:29.690 --> 02:32:29.700 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:32:31.370 --> 02:32:31.380 align:start position:0%
um you know what what they've you know
 
02:32:32.929 --> 02:32:32.939 align:start position:0%
continuing what what they've learned in
 
02:32:37.370 --> 02:32:37.380 align:start position:0%
CTE but eyes wide open and and um and
 
02:32:40.070 --> 02:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
there's nothing inconsistent uh with
 
02:32:42.830 --> 02:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
with going on to one of New Hampshire's
 
02:32:45.530 --> 02:32:45.540 align:start position:0%
community colleges and going into the
 
02:32:47.630 --> 02:32:47.640 align:start position:0%
trades because that's one of the areas
 
02:32:49.370 --> 02:32:49.380 align:start position:0%
that our community college is constant
 
02:32:51.290 --> 02:32:51.300 align:start position:0%
in fact the University of New Hampshire
 
02:32:55.670 --> 02:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
also provides some um uh uh trade I mean
 
02:32:57.349 --> 02:32:57.359 align:start position:0%
there's an HVAC program right down in
 
02:32:59.990 --> 02:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
UNH in Manchester so
 
02:33:01.849 --> 02:33:01.859 align:start position:0%
um so but
 
02:33:04.130 --> 02:33:04.140 align:start position:0%
you don't go into that you don't go to
 
02:33:07.010 --> 02:33:07.020 align:start position:0%
UNH Manchester uh unless you complete
 
02:33:09.950 --> 02:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:11.870 --> 02:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
you go to university Maine
 
02:33:14.510 --> 02:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
without complaining of FAFSA my
 
02:33:16.929 --> 02:33:16.939 align:start position:0%
granddaughter did that early admission
 
02:33:19.250 --> 02:33:19.260 align:start position:0%
full ride
 
02:33:25.250 --> 02:33:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:27.349 --> 02:33:27.359 align:start position:0%
yeah so you know I I just you know I
 
02:33:29.630 --> 02:33:29.640 align:start position:0%
think this is just you know heavy-handed
 
02:33:32.450 --> 02:33:32.460 align:start position:0%
on all students and a student that did
 
02:33:34.910 --> 02:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
not want to complete that FAFSA didn't
 
02:33:37.190 --> 02:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
need to complete that FAFSA
 
02:33:39.349 --> 02:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
the one went to Texas A M never
 
02:33:41.750 --> 02:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
completed a FAFSA one that went to
 
02:33:45.410 --> 02:33:45.420 align:start position:0%
Elmira never completed a thousand
 
02:33:48.230 --> 02:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
just recently me I we did it for St
 
02:33:48.240 --> 02:33:49.670 align:start position:0%
just recently me I we did it for St
Lawrence

02:33:49.670 --> 02:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
Lawrence
 
02:33:52.610 --> 02:33:52.620 align:start position:0%
so I you know you know I I I don't want
 
02:33:56.809 --> 02:33:56.819 align:start position:0%
to I it's hard for me to to I mean I can
 
02:33:58.309 --> 02:33:58.319 align:start position:0%
certainly speak in the generalizations
 
02:34:00.230 --> 02:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
and what what the what the statute was
 
02:34:01.849 --> 02:34:01.859 align:start position:0%
intended for when you're talking about
 
02:34:05.270 --> 02:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
specific students uh like you're like
 
02:34:07.070 --> 02:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
you know your daughter or grand
 
02:34:08.929 --> 02:34:08.939 align:start position:0%
grandkids I don't wanna I'm not gonna
 
02:34:12.230 --> 02:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
get into that with you in a public in a
 
02:34:15.170 --> 02:34:15.180 align:start position:0%
public forum uh like this and and
 
02:34:18.349 --> 02:34:18.359 align:start position:0%
whether or not you know a college
 
02:34:20.450 --> 02:34:20.460 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
02:34:22.610 --> 02:34:22.620 align:start position:0%
you know what what a college may have
 
02:34:26.270 --> 02:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
been looking for uh in terms of um you
 
02:34:28.849 --> 02:34:28.859 align:start position:0%
know income or whether whether Student
 
02:34:31.610 --> 02:34:31.620 align:start position:0%
Financial Aid was provided for by the
 
02:34:33.230 --> 02:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
college I know there's a number of
 
02:34:36.410 --> 02:34:36.420 align:start position:0%
colleges that do provide uh full need
 
02:34:39.170 --> 02:34:39.180 align:start position:0%
and and have need blind uh admissions
 
02:34:42.469 --> 02:34:42.479 align:start position:0%
MIT being one of them and um and they'll
 
02:34:42.479 --> 02:34:43.490 align:start position:0%
MIT being one of them and um and they'll
provide

02:34:43.490 --> 02:34:43.500 align:start position:0%
provide
 
02:34:45.290 --> 02:34:45.300 align:start position:0%
um uh student
 
02:34:47.929 --> 02:34:47.939 align:start position:0%
um Financial need for families that are
 
02:34:49.730 --> 02:34:49.740 align:start position:0%
earning North and I believe the number
 
02:34:52.730 --> 02:34:52.740 align:start position:0%
is is is above four hundred thousand
 
02:34:55.130 --> 02:34:55.140 align:start position:0%
dollars right now you'll still get some
 
02:34:57.050 --> 02:34:57.060 align:start position:0%
some student need
 
02:34:59.330 --> 02:34:59.340 align:start position:0%
um and I know that's a high number when
 
02:35:01.969 --> 02:35:01.979 align:start position:0%
when talking about median household
 
02:35:04.929 --> 02:35:04.939 align:start position:0%
incomes generally in in New Hampshire
 
02:35:08.330 --> 02:35:08.340 align:start position:0%
but but you know it may be something
 
02:35:11.929 --> 02:35:11.939 align:start position:0%
that that that some high earners in New
 
02:35:13.849 --> 02:35:13.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire might be surprised to know
 
02:35:17.330 --> 02:35:17.340 align:start position:0%
that that uh that they qualify for um
 
02:35:21.230 --> 02:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
for um federal financial aid or or even
 
02:35:22.870 --> 02:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
more importantly
 
02:35:25.910 --> 02:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
financial aid from the the institution
 
02:35:28.610 --> 02:35:28.620 align:start position:0%
that they that they that they go into
 
02:35:31.490 --> 02:35:31.500 align:start position:0%
and a lot of this financial aid come in
 
02:35:33.650 --> 02:35:33.660 align:start position:0%
the form of Grants as opposed to loans
 
02:35:36.110 --> 02:35:36.120 align:start position:0%
uh this could very well be something
 
02:35:38.330 --> 02:35:38.340 align:start position:0%
that helps reduce New Hampshire's
 
02:35:41.750 --> 02:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
student loan debt by by opening the door
 
02:35:44.750 --> 02:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
for more students to uh to receive
 
02:35:47.510 --> 02:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
direct grants from the institutions they
 
02:35:47.520 --> 02:35:49.010 align:start position:0%
direct grants from the institutions they
attend

02:35:49.010 --> 02:35:49.020 align:start position:0%
attend
 
02:35:52.210 --> 02:35:52.220 align:start position:0%
um uh yeah you know
 
02:35:55.190 --> 02:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
they're all institutions including the
 
02:35:58.070 --> 02:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
the university system community college
 
02:36:00.650 --> 02:36:00.660 align:start position:0%
system Tim Allison is in here quite a
 
02:36:00.660 --> 02:36:01.610 align:start position:0%
system Tim Allison is in here quite a
bit

02:36:01.610 --> 02:36:01.620 align:start position:0%
bit
 
02:36:03.830 --> 02:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
um who uh who directs the the community
 
02:36:08.389 --> 02:36:08.399 align:start position:0%
college system uh foundation and um and
 
02:36:09.950 --> 02:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
I think they'll all be the first to
 
02:36:12.889 --> 02:36:12.899 align:start position:0%
admit that one of the things that has um
 
02:36:16.610 --> 02:36:16.620 align:start position:0%
has opened the doors to so many students
 
02:36:18.290 --> 02:36:18.300 align:start position:0%
um to attend college particularly first
 
02:36:20.750 --> 02:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
in family to attend college is the
 
02:36:23.929 --> 02:36:23.939 align:start position:0%
generosity of alumni and
 
02:36:26.870 --> 02:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
um and you know I think if if if
 
02:36:31.010 --> 02:36:31.020 align:start position:0%
colleges are going to protect that that
 
02:36:33.530 --> 02:36:33.540 align:start position:0%
Revenue source of the generation of
 
02:36:35.870 --> 02:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
alumni to contribute to to college
 
02:36:39.050 --> 02:36:39.060 align:start position:0%
scholarship foundations than than these
 
02:36:41.870 --> 02:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
institutions better be strong at making
 
02:36:44.030 --> 02:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
sure that we're providing the need where
 
02:36:46.550 --> 02:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
it's needed and um and that's one of the
 
02:36:48.469 --> 02:36:48.479 align:start position:0%
things that the FAFSA helps to ensure
 
02:36:51.910 --> 02:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
that uh that that that that
 
02:36:54.550 --> 02:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
you know that
 
02:36:58.309 --> 02:36:58.319 align:start position:0%
based on answering the the questions and
 
02:37:01.130 --> 02:37:01.140 align:start position:0%
the information that's that's provided
 
02:37:04.849 --> 02:37:04.859 align:start position:0%
um uh through through you know tax
 
02:37:04.859 --> 02:37:06.290 align:start position:0%
um uh through through you know tax
information

02:37:06.290 --> 02:37:06.300 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:37:08.510 --> 02:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
um that that that comes over directly
 
02:37:11.690 --> 02:37:11.700 align:start position:0%
now uh apparently that that that a
 
02:37:13.010 --> 02:37:13.020 align:start position:0%
student's need is going to be
 
02:37:15.830 --> 02:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
demonstrated and um and Foundation
 
02:37:18.050 --> 02:37:18.060 align:start position:0%
dollars are going to be applied where um
 
02:37:20.389 --> 02:37:20.399 align:start position:0%
where they're needed thank you are there
 
02:37:22.010 --> 02:37:22.020 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
02:37:24.710 --> 02:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher
 
02:37:26.330 --> 02:37:26.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:37:27.830 --> 02:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
my question I just wanted to follow up
 
02:37:30.050 --> 02:37:30.060 align:start position:0%
uh quickly on a question that the chair
 
02:37:32.030 --> 02:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
posed about
 
02:37:34.670 --> 02:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
um the specific situation and whether or
 
02:37:36.410 --> 02:37:36.420 align:start position:0%
not a student would graduate you know
 
02:37:38.750 --> 02:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
early graduation or early acceptance to
 
02:37:41.510 --> 02:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
a college not for the nav FAFSA
 
02:37:43.610 --> 02:37:43.620 align:start position:0%
um and I know you've said that they
 
02:37:44.990 --> 02:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
would not be held back because of the
 
02:37:47.030 --> 02:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
waiver but I've looked at it I don't see
 
02:37:49.730 --> 02:37:49.740 align:start position:0%
anything that would require that waiver
 
02:37:52.429 --> 02:37:52.439 align:start position:0%
so would you agree that it would be at
 
02:37:54.590 --> 02:37:54.600 align:start position:0%
the discretion of the principal whether
 
02:37:57.770 --> 02:37:57.780 align:start position:0%
they would graduate or not so the waiver
 
02:37:59.990 --> 02:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
um thanks thanks for the question
 
02:38:01.910 --> 02:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
um uh the waiver
 
02:38:04.389 --> 02:38:04.399 align:start position:0%
um can be can be completed by the family
 
02:38:08.510 --> 02:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
uh and um and you know I think if if
 
02:38:13.370 --> 02:38:13.380 align:start position:0%
we're in a situation where where uh
 
02:38:17.150 --> 02:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
my family was so concerned
 
02:38:20.330 --> 02:38:20.340 align:start position:0%
that that about about our son or
 
02:38:23.990 --> 02:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
daughter not attending not being able to
 
02:38:25.670 --> 02:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
um to to
 
02:38:28.910 --> 02:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
go to college early decision because we
 
02:38:31.610 --> 02:38:31.620 align:start position:0%
didn't complete a FAFSA and we're beside
 
02:38:34.130 --> 02:38:34.140 align:start position:0%
ourselves that that that our kids may
 
02:38:36.950 --> 02:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
not graduate that you know what we we'd
 
02:38:39.110 --> 02:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
fill out a waiver and do it but if we
 
02:38:41.809 --> 02:38:41.819 align:start position:0%
didn't let's say that that I just had a
 
02:38:45.170 --> 02:38:45.180 align:start position:0%
refusal of filling out waivers
 
02:38:48.230 --> 02:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
um that the principal then could um
 
02:38:51.730 --> 02:38:51.740 align:start position:0%
could either fill out a waiver or a test
 
02:38:55.730 --> 02:38:55.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:58.969 --> 02:38:58.979 align:start position:0%
the school had provided information to
 
02:39:01.610 --> 02:39:01.620 align:start position:0%
the student and their family about FAFSA
 
02:39:01.620 --> 02:39:05.210 align:start position:0%
the student and their family about FAFSA
completion

02:39:05.210 --> 02:39:05.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:07.490 --> 02:39:07.500 align:start position:0%
or if they didn't do that
 
02:39:09.530 --> 02:39:09.540 align:start position:0%
and they had
 
02:39:12.770 --> 02:39:12.780 align:start position:0%
80 percent or nor or more uh perhaps the
 
02:39:14.030 --> 02:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
completion rate that the prince
 
02:39:16.610 --> 02:39:16.620 align:start position:0%
principal could attest to that as well
 
02:39:21.770 --> 02:39:21.780 align:start position:0%
so so I I think there's there's
 
02:39:23.570 --> 02:39:23.580 align:start position:0%
the first mechanism is complete the
 
02:39:23.580 --> 02:39:25.849 align:start position:0%
the first mechanism is complete the
FAFSA

02:39:25.849 --> 02:39:25.859 align:start position:0%
FAFSA
 
02:39:28.250 --> 02:39:28.260 align:start position:0%
and the other three mechanisms are
 
02:39:28.260 --> 02:39:30.469 align:start position:0%
and the other three mechanisms are
waiver

02:39:30.469 --> 02:39:30.479 align:start position:0%
waiver
 
02:39:33.110 --> 02:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
good faith support and assistant
 
02:39:35.150 --> 02:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
or with this amendment
 
02:39:37.190 --> 02:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
eighty percent FAFSA completion rate in
 
02:39:39.650 --> 02:39:39.660 align:start position:0%
the preceding year
 
02:39:41.090 --> 02:39:41.100 align:start position:0%
um that that
 
02:39:42.849 --> 02:39:42.859 align:start position:0%
and and
 
02:39:45.349 --> 02:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
you know and you know I I don't think
 
02:39:48.830 --> 02:39:48.840 align:start position:0%
anybody is necessarily more
 
02:39:51.770 --> 02:39:51.780 align:start position:0%
more expert at least as far as you know
 
02:39:56.150 --> 02:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
today on the efforts that have that are
 
02:39:57.770 --> 02:39:57.780 align:start position:0%
being done by neef
 
02:40:01.429 --> 02:40:01.439 align:start position:0%
and others across the state and um and
 
02:40:03.469 --> 02:40:03.479 align:start position:0%
and what's been going on in other states
 
02:40:07.510 --> 02:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
and there's just no evidence of um of of
 
02:40:11.090 --> 02:40:11.100 align:start position:0%
anybody under that circumstance having
 
02:40:15.530 --> 02:40:15.540 align:start position:0%
their high school diploma withheld so so
 
02:40:19.730 --> 02:40:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:21.410 --> 02:40:21.420 align:start position:0%
I don't think that's something that's
 
02:40:23.990 --> 02:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
that that we've seen further questions
 
02:40:26.570 --> 02:40:26.580 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
02:40:29.090 --> 02:40:29.100 align:start position:0%
not seeing thank you very much thank you
 
02:40:30.469 --> 02:40:30.479 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
02:40:33.170 --> 02:40:33.180 align:start position:0%
okay are there any other pink cards for
 
02:40:34.969 --> 02:40:34.979 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
02:40:37.670 --> 02:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
not see any thank you very much we will
 
02:40:45.170 --> 02:40:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:46.610 --> 02:40:46.620 align:start position:0%
basically what we're gonna have to do
 
02:40:48.349 --> 02:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
now is we're going to go the next step
 
02:40:50.030 --> 02:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
is that we're going to have to take
 
02:40:51.410 --> 02:40:51.420 align:start position:0%
action these two bills but we'll
 
02:40:54.110 --> 02:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
probably have a caucus prior to that
 
02:41:01.610 --> 02:41:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:05.330 --> 02:41:05.340 align:start position:0%
so let's take you know if we
 
02:41:07.870 --> 02:41:07.880 align:start position:0%
were looking at we're at 12 35 right now
 
02:41:11.030 --> 02:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
so if we have an hour fullness can we
 
02:41:13.250 --> 02:41:13.260 align:start position:0%
also caucus in that same time
 
02:41:14.990 --> 02:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
yes I would think so
 
02:41:16.790 --> 02:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
let's do that
 
02:41:22.429 --> 02:41:22.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:26.210 --> 02:41:26.220 align:start position:0%
yeah let's let's come back at 145 once
 
02:41:28.790 --> 02:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
we do the action on this bill then all
 
02:41:31.730 --> 02:41:31.740 align:start position:0%
these people subbing today can can lead
 
02:41:33.170 --> 02:41:33.180 align:start position:0%
because we're just going to be doing the
 
02:41:35.389 --> 02:41:35.399 align:start position:0%
organization or subcommittees
 
02:41:35.399 --> 02:41:38.750 align:start position:0%
organization or subcommittees
145.

02:41:38.750 --> 02:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:55.130 --> 04:31:55.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:55.140 --> 04:32:08.870 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:32:08.870 --> 04:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:13.370 --> 04:32:13.380 align:start position:0%
is to deal with the tubules that we have
 
04:32:17.330 --> 04:32:17.340 align:start position:0%
for exacting 136 has amended possibly by
 
04:32:19.250 --> 04:32:19.260 align:start position:0%
one of those three non-germaine we heard
 
04:32:20.389 --> 04:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
04:32:24.590 --> 04:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
and then 213 which is a bill that deals
 
04:32:26.570 --> 04:32:26.580 align:start position:0%
with social media and Career Technical
 
04:32:26.580 --> 04:32:28.250 align:start position:0%
with social media and Career Technical
education

04:32:28.250 --> 04:32:28.260 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:32:31.309 --> 04:32:31.319 align:start position:0%
um so what I'd like to do first is
 
04:32:34.790 --> 04:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
explain to the public that
 
04:32:36.769 --> 04:32:36.779 align:start position:0%
we have there's going to be some
 
04:32:38.750 --> 04:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
discussion Within These two bills which
 
04:32:41.269 --> 04:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
we have coming up the bills have to be
 
04:32:43.490 --> 04:32:43.500 align:start position:0%
out of that this committee today as they
 
04:32:46.429 --> 04:32:46.439 align:start position:0%
have to be reported by Thursday and
 
04:32:47.929 --> 04:32:47.939 align:start position:0%
quite truthfully I don't think a lot of
 
04:32:51.050 --> 04:32:51.060 align:start position:0%
us want to come back uh Wednesday uh to
 
04:32:52.429 --> 04:32:52.439 align:start position:0%
work on this
 
04:32:54.889 --> 04:32:54.899 align:start position:0%
I got a couple guys from that
 
04:32:56.750 --> 04:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:32:57.950 --> 04:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
um we're gonna have to deal with it
 
04:33:00.950 --> 04:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
today one way or the other then what we
 
04:33:04.310 --> 04:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
have following that is that we have uh
 
04:33:06.830 --> 04:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
bills which we have retained which there
 
04:33:09.890 --> 04:33:09.900 align:start position:0%
will be very little if any discussion on
 
04:33:12.349 --> 04:33:12.359 align:start position:0%
the particular topics what we're trying
 
04:33:15.709 --> 04:33:15.719 align:start position:0%
to do is just one thing only is to
 
04:33:16.970 --> 04:33:16.980 align:start position:0%
discern whether we're going to have a
 
04:33:18.769 --> 04:33:18.779 align:start position:0%
subcommittee for a particular bill or
 
04:33:21.051 --> 04:33:21.061 align:start position:0%
not have a subcommittee and wait to take
 
04:33:22.789 --> 04:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
up that bill during a committee of the
 
04:33:22.799 --> 04:33:23.570 align:start position:0%
up that bill during a committee of the
whole

04:33:23.570 --> 04:33:23.580 align:start position:0%
whole
 
04:33:26.869 --> 04:33:26.879 align:start position:0%
uh later on next fall so the
 
04:33:29.029 --> 04:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
subcommittees we would identify there's
 
04:33:30.830 --> 04:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
definitely several bills here which we
 
04:33:33.051 --> 04:33:33.061 align:start position:0%
can combine into one subcommittee but we
 
04:33:35.150 --> 04:33:35.160 align:start position:0%
just don't have the workforce here to do
 
04:33:37.551 --> 04:33:37.561 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee in all 20 bills and do it
 
04:33:37.561 --> 04:33:38.750 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee in all 20 bills and do it
properly

04:33:38.750 --> 04:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
properly
 
04:33:42.609 --> 04:33:42.619 align:start position:0%
so with that we will be doing that
 
04:33:45.709 --> 04:33:45.719 align:start position:0%
occur yeah and then we do have four
 
04:33:47.990 --> 04:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
bills which we've received from the
 
04:33:49.609 --> 04:33:49.619 align:start position:0%
Senate which this group's going to have
 
04:33:51.709 --> 04:33:51.719 align:start position:0%
to decide whether we concur non-concur
 
04:33:54.590 --> 04:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
or request a committee a conference uh
 
04:33:57.170 --> 04:33:57.180 align:start position:0%
that we can also do if we have to by way
 
04:33:59.090 --> 04:33:59.100 align:start position:0%
of the web as we've done it oftentimes
 
04:34:02.150 --> 04:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
before that's not a public process it's
 
04:34:04.250 --> 04:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
one of which we do internally with the
 
04:34:04.260 --> 04:34:05.529 align:start position:0%
one of which we do internally with the
committee

04:34:05.529 --> 04:34:05.539 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:34:08.869 --> 04:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
lastly we are in the process of trying
 
04:34:11.810 --> 04:34:11.820 align:start position:0%
to update this group right here on where
 
04:34:13.789 --> 04:34:13.799 align:start position:0%
we are with our finances in terms of
 
04:34:15.709 --> 04:34:15.719 align:start position:0%
education for the upcoming biennium
 
04:34:18.170 --> 04:34:18.180 align:start position:0%
there's been a number of recent changes
 
04:34:21.170 --> 04:34:21.180 align:start position:0%
including today with Senate finance and
 
04:34:24.051 --> 04:34:24.061 align:start position:0%
that we're we just need be all on top of
 
04:34:26.990 --> 04:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
where the education funding formula is
 
04:34:29.029 --> 04:34:29.039 align:start position:0%
and how it's going to impact various
 
04:34:30.949 --> 04:34:30.959 align:start position:0%
educational programs
 
04:34:33.890 --> 04:34:33.900 align:start position:0%
so let's get on with with the executing
 
04:34:35.570 --> 04:34:35.580 align:start position:0%
of the bills here first and get that
 
04:34:38.269 --> 04:34:38.279 align:start position:0%
done with we want to look at
 
04:34:44.510 --> 04:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
um the 136 bill for Senate bill 136.
 
04:34:46.670 --> 04:34:46.680 align:start position:0%
this bill prohibits the employment of
 
04:34:49.609 --> 04:34:49.619 align:start position:0%
volunteering or of of a revoked or
 
04:34:51.890 --> 04:34:51.900 align:start position:0%
suspended educator
 
04:34:54.230 --> 04:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
um in in a school district
 
04:34:57.890 --> 04:34:57.900 align:start position:0%
and so I need to have a before we can
 
04:34:59.689 --> 04:34:59.699 align:start position:0%
get into any Amendment we need to have a
 
04:35:03.170 --> 04:35:03.180 align:start position:0%
motion on the bill itself
 
04:35:04.970 --> 04:35:04.980 align:start position:0%
represent Cordell you ready to make a
 
04:35:08.810 --> 04:35:08.820 align:start position:0%
motion I am uh I am I am and that would
 
04:35:10.970 --> 04:35:10.980 align:start position:0%
be ought to pass is there a second on
 
04:35:13.551 --> 04:35:13.561 align:start position:0%
the opt pass on 136
 
04:35:15.470 --> 04:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
okay we have a second from represent
 
04:35:20.570 --> 04:35:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:22.429 --> 04:35:22.439 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
04:35:22.439 --> 04:35:23.209 align:start position:0%
so with that
um

04:35:23.209 --> 04:35:23.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:25.010 --> 04:35:25.020 align:start position:0%
is there any discussion from the maker
 
04:35:26.631 --> 04:35:26.641 align:start position:0%
of the motion
 
04:35:29.150 --> 04:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
and none I'm sure we'll have plenty of
 
04:35:30.769 --> 04:35:30.779 align:start position:0%
discussion on other topics
 
04:35:34.250 --> 04:35:34.260 align:start position:0%

Amendment we heard this morning it deals
 
04:36:09.590 --> 04:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
with uh the issue of FAFSA the free
 
04:36:11.631 --> 04:36:11.641 align:start position:0%
application for federal student aid
 
04:36:14.449 --> 04:36:14.459 align:start position:0%
assistance which is uh an issue dealt
 
04:36:18.051 --> 04:36:18.061 align:start position:0%
with by the high schools uh we had three
 
04:36:20.510 --> 04:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
uh hearings this morning uh I'm not
 
04:36:22.250 --> 04:36:22.260 align:start position:0%
going to discuss any further seeing I I
 
04:36:24.650 --> 04:36:24.660 align:start position:0%
presented it and uh I think everybody in
 
04:36:28.070 --> 04:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:30.109 --> 04:36:30.119 align:start position:0%
Is there further discussion from members
 
04:36:32.750 --> 04:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
of the committee on that
 
04:36:36.170 --> 04:36:36.180 align:start position:0%
sure yes representative Luna
 
04:36:39.109 --> 04:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much Mr chair
 
04:36:41.631 --> 04:36:41.641 align:start position:0%
um while I think 1744
 
04:36:45.051 --> 04:36:45.061 align:start position:0%
it helps to you know codify what some
 
04:36:47.750 --> 04:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
districts are doing right now I I think
 
04:36:52.269 --> 04:36:52.279 align:start position:0%
it um it it it doesn't move the needle
 
04:36:55.849 --> 04:36:55.859 align:start position:0%
uh in um with many of the districts who
 
04:36:57.131 --> 04:36:57.141 align:start position:0%
are currently
 
04:37:01.789 --> 04:37:01.799 align:start position:0%
the lad amendment to 136.
 
04:37:04.689 --> 04:37:04.699 align:start position:0%
no this is the lad amendment to 136.
 
04:37:07.609 --> 04:37:07.619 align:start position:0%
yeah the motion was made by Noble second
 
04:37:09.890 --> 04:37:09.900 align:start position:0%
in my lad but we're talking about 1744.
 
04:37:13.670 --> 04:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
that's right 1744. yes that that um in
 
04:37:15.529 --> 04:37:15.539 align:start position:0%
some districts that are actually
 
04:37:19.429 --> 04:37:19.439 align:start position:0%
doing this and like I say some districts
 
04:37:21.289 --> 04:37:21.299 align:start position:0%
are doing this but in in some that are
 
04:37:23.330 --> 04:37:23.340 align:start position:0%
doing it right now like representative
 
04:37:25.131 --> 04:37:25.141 align:start position:0%
grassy's district
 
04:37:27.949 --> 04:37:27.959 align:start position:0%
um there it's only achieving a about a
 
04:37:27.959 --> 04:37:29.090 align:start position:0%
um there it's only achieving a about a
20

04:37:29.090 --> 04:37:29.100 align:start position:0%
20
 
04:37:31.070 --> 04:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
um FAFSA completion rate Which is far
 
04:37:33.189 --> 04:37:33.199 align:start position:0%
short of of I think any reasonable
 
04:37:36.170 --> 04:37:36.180 align:start position:0%
Benchmark in less than half of what the
 
04:37:38.269 --> 04:37:38.279 align:start position:0%
uh what the state average achievement
 
04:37:40.730 --> 04:37:40.740 align:start position:0%
rate is so um so
 
04:37:44.090 --> 04:37:44.100 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm inclined to want to leave the
 
04:37:47.570 --> 04:37:47.580 align:start position:0%
um the the current Statute in place give
 
04:37:51.051 --> 04:37:51.061 align:start position:0%
it a chance to um to perform it hasn't
 
04:37:52.849 --> 04:37:52.859 align:start position:0%
even come into effect
 
04:37:54.410 --> 04:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
um in fact doesn't even go into effect
 
04:37:57.590 --> 04:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
until uh until July and give some
 
04:38:00.769 --> 04:38:00.779 align:start position:0%
districts a time to uh to see how it uh
 
04:38:03.051 --> 04:38:03.061 align:start position:0%
see how it works out
 
04:38:04.730 --> 04:38:04.740 align:start position:0%
further discussion on it yes
 
04:38:04.740 --> 04:38:08.689 align:start position:0%
further discussion on it yes
representative

04:38:08.689 --> 04:38:08.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:10.551 --> 04:38:10.561 align:start position:0%
what we're really concerned about is
 
04:38:13.250 --> 04:38:13.260 align:start position:0%
making sure that all students are
 
04:38:17.449 --> 04:38:17.459 align:start position:0%
exposed to the FAFSA have
 
04:38:19.849 --> 04:38:19.859 align:start position:0%
um know what what their benefits are
 
04:38:22.490 --> 04:38:22.500 align:start position:0%
from it all of that this makes sure that
 
04:38:25.310 --> 04:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
all students are exposed to it if there
 
04:38:26.510 --> 04:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
are districts
 
04:38:29.029 --> 04:38:29.039 align:start position:0%
whose parents if who are going through
 
04:38:32.390 --> 04:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
all of this and they're not having a
 
04:38:35.150 --> 04:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
bigger application rate I would argue it
 
04:38:36.910 --> 04:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
was because the parents didn't want to
 
04:38:40.670 --> 04:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
and I have spoken to numerous parents
 
04:38:42.170 --> 04:38:42.180 align:start position:0%
from um
 
04:38:46.070 --> 04:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
multiple Parts both very poor and
 
04:38:46.080 --> 04:38:47.869 align:start position:0%
multiple Parts both very poor and
sufficiently

04:38:47.869 --> 04:38:47.879 align:start position:0%
sufficiently
 
04:38:51.349 --> 04:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
I won't say very rich but sufficient
 
04:38:54.830 --> 04:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
um who just absolutely disagree with
 
04:38:56.689 --> 04:38:56.699 align:start position:0%
having to give any of their personal
 
04:38:59.570 --> 04:38:59.580 align:start position:0%
information over the consider it a
 
04:39:02.390 --> 04:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
violation of their privacy and
 
04:39:05.631 --> 04:39:05.641 align:start position:0%
unfortunately you can't just apply and
 
04:39:07.369 --> 04:39:07.379 align:start position:0%
get an answer you have to actually
 
04:39:09.470 --> 04:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
choose a college
 
04:39:12.109 --> 04:39:12.119 align:start position:0%
and that college gets your information
 
04:39:15.289 --> 04:39:15.299 align:start position:0%
so you're in private information is out
 
04:39:18.470 --> 04:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
there and what I have heard is that they
 
04:39:21.230 --> 04:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
just don't want to do that so forcing
 
04:39:23.150 --> 04:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
them to do that and holding graduation
 
04:39:26.209 --> 04:39:26.219 align:start position:0%
over their children's head in order to
 
04:39:28.490 --> 04:39:28.500 align:start position:0%
force parents to
 
04:39:28.500 --> 04:39:29.330 align:start position:0%
force parents to
um

04:39:29.330 --> 04:39:29.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:31.551 --> 04:39:31.561 align:start position:0%
provide private information I think is
 
04:39:33.349 --> 04:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
totally not what the state should be
 
04:39:33.359 --> 04:39:34.730 align:start position:0%
totally not what the state should be
doing

04:39:34.730 --> 04:39:34.740 align:start position:0%
doing
 
04:39:37.430 --> 04:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
04:39:40.850 --> 04:39:40.860 align:start position:0%
I'd like to say one thing about that the
 
04:39:43.250 --> 04:39:43.260 align:start position:0%
Department of Education has developed a
 
04:39:43.260 --> 04:39:44.448 align:start position:0%
Department of Education has developed a
FAFSA

04:39:44.448 --> 04:39:44.458 align:start position:0%
FAFSA
 
04:39:46.610 --> 04:39:46.620 align:start position:0%
waiver form
 
04:39:49.610 --> 04:39:49.620 align:start position:0%
that form is simply a form in which the
 
04:39:52.850 --> 04:39:52.860 align:start position:0%
student or the parent of the student if
 
04:39:54.350 --> 04:39:54.360 align:start position:0%
the student's not 18
 
04:39:57.708 --> 04:39:57.718 align:start position:0%
signs the form goes nowhere
 
04:40:00.590 --> 04:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
it does not go to doe so will not be
 
04:40:03.288 --> 04:40:03.298 align:start position:0%
part of the I platform at all there's
 
04:40:05.208 --> 04:40:05.218 align:start position:0%
nothing in statute says that this is
 
04:40:07.850 --> 04:40:07.860 align:start position:0%
part of the I platform as it's been
 
04:40:10.310 --> 04:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
alluded to earlier it just stays right
 
04:40:12.770 --> 04:40:12.780 align:start position:0%
there probably on file somewhere in the
 
04:40:15.230 --> 04:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
school district or the school or the
 
04:40:17.170 --> 04:40:17.180 align:start position:0%
school district office
 
04:40:20.510 --> 04:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
it's basically in alignment with what we
 
04:40:22.730 --> 04:40:22.740 align:start position:0%
heard from the superintendents today and
 
04:40:24.910 --> 04:40:24.920 align:start position:0%
we know there's well over 20
 
04:40:27.770 --> 04:40:27.780 align:start position:0%
superintendents assigned a letter a memo
 
04:40:30.010 --> 04:40:30.020 align:start position:0%
that representative Noble provided us
 
04:40:33.288 --> 04:40:33.298 align:start position:0%
that states that they believe the
 
04:40:36.010 --> 04:40:36.020 align:start position:0%
process is is good we need to let
 
04:40:40.130 --> 04:40:40.140 align:start position:0%
students know that FAFSA is a process in
 
04:40:42.350 --> 04:40:42.360 align:start position:0%
which they can receive Monies to help
 
04:40:44.208 --> 04:40:44.218 align:start position:0%
support their efforts to go to college
 
04:40:48.830 --> 04:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
we all agree on that its problem is that
 
04:40:50.750 --> 04:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
and it's this this amendment Essence
 
04:40:52.970 --> 04:40:52.980 align:start position:0%
data ensures that the students will see
 
04:40:55.190 --> 04:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
this form and have it communicated to
 
04:40:57.650 --> 04:40:57.660 align:start position:0%
them and allows the school districts to
 
04:41:00.110 --> 04:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
local school district to continue doing
 
04:41:02.390 --> 04:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
what they're normally doing in terms of
 
04:41:05.930 --> 04:41:05.940 align:start position:0%
this process of informing students these
 
04:41:07.368 --> 04:41:07.378 align:start position:0%
graduation high school students
 
04:41:10.930 --> 04:41:10.940 align:start position:0%
graduating of the the the the the the
 
04:41:13.430 --> 04:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
processes that that are taken to fill
 
04:41:15.350 --> 04:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
the form out so they have counselor to
 
04:41:17.868 --> 04:41:17.878 align:start position:0%
help fill the form out they have family
 
04:41:20.330 --> 04:41:20.340 align:start position:0%
Information Center sessions at night
 
04:41:22.190 --> 04:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
time or during the day available to them
 
04:41:24.230 --> 04:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
it's offered through teachers at the
 
04:41:26.890 --> 04:41:26.900 align:start position:0%
school many different ways of doing this
 
04:41:31.128 --> 04:41:31.138 align:start position:0%
and quite successful at that the process
 
04:41:34.788 --> 04:41:34.798 align:start position:0%
comes the the conflict comes is that
 
04:41:34.798 --> 04:41:35.448 align:start position:0%
comes the the conflict comes is that
um

04:41:35.448 --> 04:41:35.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:38.390 --> 04:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
when we start telling them that you will
 
04:41:42.050 --> 04:41:42.060 align:start position:0%
not graduate if you haven't jumped all
 
04:41:44.570 --> 04:41:44.580 align:start position:0%
these hoops and it takes a school
 
04:41:47.208 --> 04:41:47.218 align:start position:0%
principle a lot of effort and time to
 
04:41:49.730 --> 04:41:49.740 align:start position:0%
chase down people to get permission for
 
04:41:52.730 --> 04:41:52.740 align:start position:0%
them or get their signature on this form
 
04:41:54.230 --> 04:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
right here
 
04:41:57.410 --> 04:41:57.420 align:start position:0%
and that's all just another requirement
 
04:41:59.690 --> 04:41:59.700 align:start position:0%
and so you get the signature the parent
 
04:42:01.550 --> 04:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
so be it you know you can't get a
 
04:42:03.350 --> 04:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
telephone conversation essentially like
 
04:42:05.390 --> 04:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
that and say parent says yes you have to
 
04:42:07.310 --> 04:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
have the parent come and sign the form
 
04:42:09.708 --> 04:42:09.718 align:start position:0%
or give it to a student and bring it
 
04:42:11.868 --> 04:42:11.878 align:start position:0%
back well everybody knows getting
 
04:42:13.250 --> 04:42:13.260 align:start position:0%
permission slips home even from
 
04:42:15.230 --> 04:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
elementary kids regarding a field trip
 
04:42:18.230 --> 04:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
can be a devil of a Time
 
04:42:20.690 --> 04:42:20.700 align:start position:0%
um and uh to get something like this and
 
04:42:22.430 --> 04:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
we don't even get the application forms
 
04:42:23.990 --> 04:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
back for free and reduced in the high
 
04:42:26.448 --> 04:42:26.458 align:start position:0%
school kids and we know we're shallow
 
04:42:28.190 --> 04:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
numbers in terms of determining free and
 
04:42:30.170 --> 04:42:30.180 align:start position:0%
reduced and poverty in these schools
 
04:42:32.390 --> 04:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
just resulted that's why we had Medicaid
 
04:42:34.670 --> 04:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
direct which we're going after
 
04:42:37.970 --> 04:42:37.980 align:start position:0%
so we have many school districts here
 
04:42:40.910 --> 04:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
that came and said we we support the
 
04:42:43.070 --> 04:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
process of FAFSA it's a very important
 
04:42:45.288 --> 04:42:45.298 align:start position:0%
step it shouldn't be part of what we
 
04:42:47.810 --> 04:42:47.820 align:start position:0%
require in order to get out of school it
 
04:42:50.448 --> 04:42:50.458 align:start position:0%
should be achievement and performance in
 
04:42:52.788 --> 04:42:52.798 align:start position:0%
terms of those 20 to 24 credits of
 
04:42:54.288 --> 04:42:54.298 align:start position:0%
course is required
 
04:42:58.310 --> 04:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
so the amendment does not stop the
 
04:43:01.128 --> 04:43:01.138 align:start position:0%
process as far as FAFSA communication
 
04:43:04.368 --> 04:43:04.378 align:start position:0%
what it does stop though is that threat
 
04:43:07.368 --> 04:43:07.378 align:start position:0%
of graduation has been taken off the off
 
04:43:09.530 --> 04:43:09.540 align:start position:0%
the off the statute throughout the books
 
04:43:13.310 --> 04:43:13.320 align:start position:0%
so I think this is a a good step forward
 
04:43:15.170 --> 04:43:15.180 align:start position:0%
and in line with what schools are doing
 
04:43:17.810 --> 04:43:17.820 align:start position:0%
and supports them and ensures the FAFSA
 
04:43:21.590 --> 04:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
will be provided to students this bill
 
04:43:24.590 --> 04:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:27.590 --> 04:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli uh thank you
 
04:43:29.810 --> 04:43:29.820 align:start position:0%
um and I believe the chairman lad you
 
04:43:32.570 --> 04:43:32.580 align:start position:0%
mentioned the waiver would not
 
04:43:34.610 --> 04:43:34.620 align:start position:0%
necessarily go anywhere
 
04:43:38.448 --> 04:43:38.458 align:start position:0%
um it it could be as we heard from the
 
04:43:38.458 --> 04:43:39.350 align:start position:0%
um it it could be as we heard from the
Department

04:43:39.350 --> 04:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
Department
 
04:43:41.930 --> 04:43:41.940 align:start position:0%
um they don't know what happens to it it
 
04:43:43.368 --> 04:43:43.378 align:start position:0%
can be filed in the drawer it could be
 
04:43:45.830 --> 04:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
shredded it could be anything and I
 
04:43:48.350 --> 04:43:48.360 align:start position:0%
think the same applies for the current
 
04:43:51.490 --> 04:43:51.500 align:start position:0%
law paragraph two about
 
04:43:55.730 --> 04:43:55.740 align:start position:0%
if the parent does not sign the waiver
 
04:43:59.270 --> 04:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
and there's no FAFSA filed the principal
 
04:44:02.030 --> 04:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
can attest to they made a good for Faith
 
04:44:05.448 --> 04:44:05.458 align:start position:0%
effort but as I pointed out a test
 
04:44:09.170 --> 04:44:09.180 align:start position:0%
to who to what there's nothing about
 
04:44:11.510 --> 04:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
what happens
 
04:44:14.570 --> 04:44:14.580 align:start position:0%
um uh does you know the superintendent
 
04:44:16.490 --> 04:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
call up and others superintendent and
 
04:44:18.110 --> 04:44:18.120 align:start position:0%
say uh you know I attest to the fact
 
04:44:19.490 --> 04:44:19.500 align:start position:0%
that we tried
 
04:44:21.770 --> 04:44:21.780 align:start position:0%
um there's nothing in statute about what
 
04:44:25.448 --> 04:44:25.458 align:start position:0%
this means so I think it's a a toothless
 
04:44:29.930 --> 04:44:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:32.090 --> 04:44:32.100 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative luno
 
04:44:34.128 --> 04:44:34.138 align:start position:0%
sure thanks I you know I think pretty
 
04:44:37.010 --> 04:44:37.020 align:start position:0%
much both the FAFSA waiver form and the
 
04:44:39.170 --> 04:44:39.180 align:start position:0%
uh the you know the principle of testing
 
04:44:41.090 --> 04:44:41.100 align:start position:0%
to the fact that a good faith effort was
 
04:44:43.368 --> 04:44:43.378 align:start position:0%
take was uh made by the district to
 
04:44:45.590 --> 04:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
inform parents and students could easily
 
04:44:47.990 --> 04:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
be done and put into the students um you
 
04:44:49.850 --> 04:44:49.860 align:start position:0%
know file of record which would have
 
04:44:51.410 --> 04:44:51.420 align:start position:0%
other compliance with graduation
 
04:44:53.448 --> 04:44:53.458 align:start position:0%
requirements as well so I think that's
 
04:44:55.550 --> 04:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
pretty simple and to say that it has to
 
04:44:58.368 --> 04:44:58.378 align:start position:0%
be spelled out in um you know black and
 
04:45:01.550 --> 04:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
white in statute is a little bit crazy
 
04:45:04.190 --> 04:45:04.200 align:start position:0%
um uh given that I think
 
04:45:05.868 --> 04:45:05.878 align:start position:0%
um it's it's pretty easy to make sure
 
04:45:07.670 --> 04:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
that these things are connected with
 
04:45:09.530 --> 04:45:09.540 align:start position:0%
them with the students performance
 
04:45:11.270 --> 04:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
through through school
 
04:45:14.690 --> 04:45:14.700 align:start position:0%
thank you for their discussion
 
04:45:16.910 --> 04:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
yes represent Lucas
 
04:45:19.430 --> 04:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to um
 
04:45:22.250 --> 04:45:22.260 align:start position:0%
repeat what one of the superintendents
 
04:45:25.910 --> 04:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
asked don't put superintendents in a
 
04:45:28.128 --> 04:45:28.138 align:start position:0%
position of withholding graduation from
 
04:45:30.830 --> 04:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
a student based on a decision of their
 
04:45:30.840 --> 04:45:32.990 align:start position:0%
a student based on a decision of their
parents

04:45:32.990 --> 04:45:33.000 align:start position:0%

04:47:15.540 --> 04:47:17.330 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:47:17.330 --> 04:47:17.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:19.788 --> 04:47:19.798 align:start position:0%
did I hear something second okay thank
 
04:47:22.490 --> 04:47:22.500 align:start position:0%
you very much uh comment from uh the
 
04:47:22.500 --> 04:47:23.810 align:start position:0%
you very much uh comment from uh the
maker

04:47:23.810 --> 04:47:23.820 align:start position:0%
maker
 
04:47:25.788 --> 04:47:25.798 align:start position:0%
yes uh
 
04:47:29.750 --> 04:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this uh this just com just
 
04:47:32.530 --> 04:47:32.540 align:start position:0%
deletes the whole program which we have
 
04:47:36.530 --> 04:47:36.540 align:start position:0%
however I believe that we do not need to
 
04:47:38.150 --> 04:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
have the threat of graduation
 
04:47:41.708 --> 04:47:41.718 align:start position:0%
requirements for any student who has
 
04:47:45.590 --> 04:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
accomplished all those 20 to 24 course
 
04:47:48.650 --> 04:47:48.660 align:start position:0%
requirements while in high school
 
04:47:51.470 --> 04:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
has no disciplinary problems however
 
04:47:54.910 --> 04:47:54.920 align:start position:0%
hasn't completed the FAFSA or paralleled
 
04:47:58.670 --> 04:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
the requirements and FAFSA by having a
 
04:48:00.530 --> 04:48:00.540 align:start position:0%
written notice something such as this
 
04:48:02.510 --> 04:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
signed off and the only other
 
04:48:04.910 --> 04:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
possibility yes is that the principal
 
04:48:06.530 --> 04:48:06.540 align:start position:0%
could say yep
 
04:48:09.948 --> 04:48:09.958 align:start position:0%
they they they get this exception I
 
04:48:12.170 --> 04:48:12.180 align:start position:0%
think to put this heavy weight over top
 
04:48:13.970 --> 04:48:13.980 align:start position:0%
of students and put something like this
 
04:48:17.090 --> 04:48:17.100 align:start position:0%
in statute is absolutely incorrect
 
04:48:20.868 --> 04:48:20.878 align:start position:0%
um the the need to threaten people with
 
04:48:23.150 --> 04:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
loss of graduation
 
04:48:25.128 --> 04:48:25.138 align:start position:0%
um there are a number of students that I
 
04:48:27.368 --> 04:48:27.378 align:start position:0%
know of and had one in my own family
 
04:48:31.730 --> 04:48:31.740 align:start position:0%
that had early admission to a division
 
04:48:35.090 --> 04:48:35.100 align:start position:0%
one School uh early in the school year
 
04:48:39.470 --> 04:48:39.480 align:start position:0%
in November totally paid for by the
 
04:48:42.230 --> 04:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
school that she was going to did not
 
04:48:44.990 --> 04:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
need FAFSA did not complete a FAFSA form
 
04:48:47.390 --> 04:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
but under this situation right here
 
04:48:51.470 --> 04:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
would have to complete a FAFSA form
 
04:48:55.070 --> 04:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:58.190 --> 04:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
uh representative Noble comment
 
04:49:00.708 --> 04:49:00.718 align:start position:0%
I agree with chairman lud
 
04:49:04.310 --> 04:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
thank you comments from the committee
 
04:49:07.430 --> 04:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
representative Paul thank you and um
 
04:49:09.650 --> 04:49:09.660 align:start position:0%
this is for representative Vlad of chair
 
04:49:11.208 --> 04:49:11.218 align:start position:0%
lad sorry
 
04:49:13.190 --> 04:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
um when you said she didn't have to
 
04:49:15.650 --> 04:49:15.660 align:start position:0%
complete a form she could have signed a
 
04:49:17.510 --> 04:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
waiver though right
 
04:49:17.520 --> 04:49:18.530 align:start position:0%
waiver though right
foreign

04:49:18.530 --> 04:49:18.540 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:49:21.410 --> 04:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
yeah she could have signed a waiver but
 
04:49:23.930 --> 04:49:23.940 align:start position:0%
why would she want to sign a waiver and
 
04:49:25.670 --> 04:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
why would her mother want to put all
 
04:49:27.890 --> 04:49:27.900 align:start position:0%
this information down if she had a full
 
04:49:31.250 --> 04:49:31.260 align:start position:0%
boat scholarship waiting for her based
 
04:49:33.010 --> 04:49:33.020 align:start position:0%
upon one thing only and one thing only
 
04:49:35.510 --> 04:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
graduation from high school
 
04:49:38.510 --> 04:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
it isn't it just follow-up follow isn't
 
04:49:40.910 --> 04:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
it just a check mark like I weighed my
 
04:49:42.650 --> 04:49:42.660 align:start position:0%
you know that you don't have to give the
 
04:49:46.850 --> 04:49:46.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:50.030 --> 04:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
the way the bill there has to be some
 
04:49:53.030 --> 04:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
kind of a sign up by her or a check by
 
04:49:55.788 --> 04:49:55.798 align:start position:0%
her or the parent
 
04:49:55.798 --> 04:49:56.448 align:start position:0%
her or the parent
um

04:49:56.448 --> 04:49:56.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:58.730 --> 04:49:58.740 align:start position:0%
this has nothing to do with the
 
04:50:00.830 --> 04:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
achievement of a student in high school
 
04:50:03.110 --> 04:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
you know when we graduate students we
 
04:50:04.610 --> 04:50:04.620 align:start position:0%
graduate them based upon their
 
04:50:06.170 --> 04:50:06.180 align:start position:0%
achievement and accomplishment of the
 
04:50:08.270 --> 04:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
what they're able supposed to be able to
 
04:50:10.430 --> 04:50:10.440 align:start position:0%
do and
 
04:50:11.990 --> 04:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
she had shown everything that she was
 
04:50:13.490 --> 04:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
supposed to do academically and
 
04:50:13.500 --> 04:50:15.590 align:start position:0%
supposed to do academically and
athletically

04:50:15.590 --> 04:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
athletically
 
04:50:18.050 --> 04:50:18.060 align:start position:0%
I see no reason why she has to jump this
 
04:50:20.110 --> 04:50:20.120 align:start position:0%
other hurdle
 
04:50:23.448 --> 04:50:23.458 align:start position:0%
representative cordiello
 
04:50:25.190 --> 04:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
yes uh
 
04:50:27.470 --> 04:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
thank you um I don't know if you all had
 
04:50:28.970 --> 04:50:28.980 align:start position:0%
a chance to read the letter Dear
 
04:50:30.050 --> 04:50:30.060 align:start position:0%
honorable members of New Hampshire
 
04:50:32.030 --> 04:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
education committee from
 
04:50:36.170 --> 04:50:36.180 align:start position:0%
20 plus superintendents I find this very
 
04:50:36.180 --> 04:50:37.970 align:start position:0%
20 plus superintendents I find this very
persuasive

04:50:37.970 --> 04:50:37.980 align:start position:0%
persuasive
 
04:50:40.250 --> 04:50:40.260 align:start position:0%
um coming from so many superintendents
 
04:50:42.230 --> 04:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
themselves mentioning phrases like
 
04:50:43.910 --> 04:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
locals to control maintaining local
 
04:50:47.510 --> 04:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
control which we all agree is very
 
04:50:48.948 --> 04:50:48.958 align:start position:0%
important there's also the phrase
 
04:50:50.570 --> 04:50:50.580 align:start position:0%
several times unnecessary government
 
04:50:52.490 --> 04:50:52.500 align:start position:0%
overreach here but one of the things
 
04:50:54.110 --> 04:50:54.120 align:start position:0%
that really strikes me
 
04:50:56.990 --> 04:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
is where they say uh
 
04:51:00.470 --> 04:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
this requirement it sends the message
 
04:51:02.270 --> 04:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
that college is the only pathway after
 
04:51:04.788 --> 04:51:04.798 align:start position:0%
graduation in a time when trade schools
 
04:51:06.110 --> 04:51:06.120 align:start position:0%
are in desperate need of a Workforce
 
04:51:08.090 --> 04:51:08.100 align:start position:0%
what message is this sending to those
 
04:51:10.128 --> 04:51:10.138 align:start position:0%
for whom college is not their first
 
04:51:11.628 --> 04:51:11.638 align:start position:0%
choice and I am concerned about what
 
04:51:13.368 --> 04:51:13.378 align:start position:0%
messages is sending
 
04:51:15.890 --> 04:51:15.900 align:start position:0%
because and I come from from this as a
 
04:51:17.890 --> 04:51:17.900 align:start position:0%
former College instructor
 
04:51:21.770 --> 04:51:21.780 align:start position:0%
whose children go to colleges and Co you
 
04:51:23.990 --> 04:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
know it's not for everyone though and we
 
04:51:27.170 --> 04:51:27.180 align:start position:0%
have the trades we have several of the
 
04:51:30.708 --> 04:51:30.718 align:start position:0%
uh those who testify made comments about
 
04:51:32.510 --> 04:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
you know how well those are going to the
 
04:51:34.910 --> 04:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
trades do but I think sometimes in high
 
04:51:36.948 --> 04:51:36.958 align:start position:0%
schools we're sending this more and more
 
04:51:39.650 --> 04:51:39.660 align:start position:0%
we're sending this message that
 
04:51:42.230 --> 04:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
college is the way to go and I think we
 
04:51:44.448 --> 04:51:44.458 align:start position:0%
should be encouraging also that some
 
04:51:48.350 --> 04:51:48.360 align:start position:0%
some kids are are more suited to going
 
04:51:51.288 --> 04:51:51.298 align:start position:0%
to not going to college and and so
 
04:51:52.990 --> 04:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
04:51:55.070 --> 04:51:55.080 align:start position:0%
requiring this
 
04:51:59.110 --> 04:51:59.120 align:start position:0%
sends a mixed message so
 
04:52:01.910 --> 04:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
that's why I think that we should not
 
04:52:05.030 --> 04:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
require it further discussion represent
 
04:52:05.040 --> 04:52:06.170 align:start position:0%
require it further discussion represent
Luna

04:52:06.170 --> 04:52:06.180 align:start position:0%
Luna
 
04:52:08.690 --> 04:52:08.700 align:start position:0%
sure thank you very much Mr chair no I
 
04:52:11.090 --> 04:52:11.100 align:start position:0%
mean I'm not confused by uh by buying
 
04:52:12.590 --> 04:52:12.600 align:start position:0%
this at all I don't think it sends a
 
04:52:15.288 --> 04:52:15.298 align:start position:0%
mixed message especially when uh when
 
04:52:18.708 --> 04:52:18.718 align:start position:0%
when many of our uh of our state
 
04:52:18.718 --> 04:52:19.550 align:start position:0%
when many of our uh of our state
um

04:52:19.550 --> 04:52:19.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:21.410 --> 04:52:21.420 align:start position:0%
um colleges and community colleges
 
04:52:21.420 --> 04:52:23.170 align:start position:0%
um colleges and community colleges
provide

04:52:23.170 --> 04:52:23.180 align:start position:0%
provide
 
04:52:27.288 --> 04:52:27.298 align:start position:0%
degrees that um that that for for people
 
04:52:29.330 --> 04:52:29.340 align:start position:0%
to take into the trades as well as
 
04:52:31.788 --> 04:52:31.798 align:start position:0%
non-degree high-value certificates for
 
04:52:34.430 --> 04:52:34.440 align:start position:0%
people to uh students to take into the
 
04:52:37.190 --> 04:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
trades and can also supplement that
 
04:52:39.708 --> 04:52:39.718 align:start position:0%
trade education with business education
 
04:52:42.110 --> 04:52:42.120 align:start position:0%
so not only do they end up working in
 
04:52:44.090 --> 04:52:44.100 align:start position:0%
the trades but they may actually be able
 
04:52:46.670 --> 04:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
to own and operate a um you know a small
 
04:52:48.650 --> 04:52:48.660 align:start position:0%
business in that area so I'm not
 
04:52:52.250 --> 04:52:52.260 align:start position:0%
confused at all by by that and secondly
 
04:52:55.310 --> 04:52:55.320 align:start position:0%
I'm not at all confused by the FAFSA
 
04:52:58.010 --> 04:52:58.020 align:start position:0%
waiver form which simply says and and
 
04:53:00.410 --> 04:53:00.420 align:start position:0%
someone put a copy
 
04:53:02.330 --> 04:53:02.340 align:start position:0%
um on the table
 
04:53:04.610 --> 04:53:04.620 align:start position:0%
um by executing below I acknowledge that
 
04:53:06.470 --> 04:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
I'm a student over the age of 18 or a
 
04:53:07.850 --> 04:53:07.860 align:start position:0%
pound of Guardian of a student who's
 
04:53:10.490 --> 04:53:10.500 align:start position:0%
under the age of 18 and I acknowledge
 
04:53:11.628 --> 04:53:11.638 align:start position:0%
that I understand that the free
 
04:53:13.310 --> 04:53:13.320 align:start position:0%
application for federal student aid
 
04:53:15.470 --> 04:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
isn't and I've chosen not to file an
 
04:53:18.410 --> 04:53:18.420 align:start position:0%
application and and I I understand this
 
04:53:21.830 --> 04:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
may seem onerous to some but the only
 
04:53:23.810 --> 04:53:23.820 align:start position:0%
information that's required on this form
 
04:53:25.910 --> 04:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
is the student name
 
04:53:28.070 --> 04:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
an email or a phone number
 
04:53:30.110 --> 04:53:30.120 align:start position:0%
a signature
 
04:53:32.448 --> 04:53:32.458 align:start position:0%
and believe it or not the date
 
04:53:33.830 --> 04:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
04:53:36.230 --> 04:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:53:38.510 --> 04:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
um you know and
 
04:53:40.128 --> 04:53:40.138 align:start position:0%
you know there's not a lot being asked
 
04:53:43.250 --> 04:53:43.260 align:start position:0%
of here I don't find it to be confusing
 
04:53:46.610 --> 04:53:46.620 align:start position:0%
but that's me and um and you know I I
 
04:53:50.390 --> 04:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
certainly think that that most students
 
04:53:51.948 --> 04:53:51.958 align:start position:0%
and families in New Hampshire would
 
04:53:53.810 --> 04:53:53.820 align:start position:0%
probably not find this form confusing
 
04:53:57.770 --> 04:53:57.780 align:start position:0%
either thank you representative D Simone
 
04:54:00.530 --> 04:54:00.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just looked at the
 
04:54:03.650 --> 04:54:03.660 align:start position:0%
FAFSA waiver form and one of the areas
 
04:54:08.208 --> 04:54:08.218 align:start position:0%
that it does not include is if a student
 
04:54:11.510 --> 04:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
under the age of 18 who is emancipated
 
04:54:16.850 --> 04:54:16.860 align:start position:0%
or married it does not re uh enter that
 
04:54:20.448 --> 04:54:20.458 align:start position:0%
in as a legal signatory to make this
 
04:54:23.110 --> 04:54:23.120 align:start position:0%
waiver form work
 
04:54:27.708 --> 04:54:27.718 align:start position:0%
so I just don't think that that is
 
04:54:31.190 --> 04:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
really complete enough to do this I I
 
04:54:34.368 --> 04:54:34.378 align:start position:0%
see no reason for it thank you just so
 
04:54:36.350 --> 04:54:36.360 align:start position:0%
everybody knows that the waiver form was
 
04:54:38.990 --> 04:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
dropped off at the conclusion at
 
04:54:43.850 --> 04:54:43.860 align:start position:0%
lunchtime by uh uh Mr Appleby who was
 
04:54:46.250 --> 04:54:46.260 align:start position:0%
here observing he dropped them and he
 
04:54:47.690 --> 04:54:47.700 align:start position:0%
had six copies so they were just left
 
04:54:48.650 --> 04:54:48.660 align:start position:0%
right there
 
04:54:51.590 --> 04:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh representative Miler and then
 
04:54:54.110 --> 04:54:54.120 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher oh thank you Mr Mr
 
04:54:56.150 --> 04:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
chairman we've spent a lot of time on
 
04:54:58.550 --> 04:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
this issue frankly a lot more than I
 
04:55:00.770 --> 04:55:00.780 align:start position:0%
thought we were going to spend on it but
 
04:55:02.690 --> 04:55:02.700 align:start position:0%
it's it's important
 
04:55:05.270 --> 04:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
um what we're what we're talking about
 
04:55:08.770 --> 04:55:08.780 align:start position:0%
here is providing an opportunity for
 
04:55:12.350 --> 04:55:12.360 align:start position:0%
students to um decide what they want to
 
04:55:12.360 --> 04:55:13.690 align:start position:0%
students to um decide what they want to
do

04:55:13.690 --> 04:55:13.700 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:55:17.030 --> 04:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
and to understand that there are there
 
04:55:19.610 --> 04:55:19.620 align:start position:0%
is financial aid available
 
04:55:21.890 --> 04:55:21.900 align:start position:0%
we're not just college and I wanted to
 
04:55:23.448 --> 04:55:23.458 align:start position:0%
score that
 
04:55:25.910 --> 04:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
I mean if you spend any time in a
 
04:55:27.530 --> 04:55:27.540 align:start position:0%
community college
 
04:55:29.930 --> 04:55:29.940 align:start position:0%
you'll begin to realize that there there
 
04:55:32.510 --> 04:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
are opportunities here
 
04:55:35.150 --> 04:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
for students and what this is really
 
04:55:38.448 --> 04:55:38.458 align:start position:0%
about is post-secondary education
 
04:55:41.270 --> 04:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
it's about post-secondary education and
 
04:55:43.970 --> 04:55:43.980 align:start position:0%
the creation of a Workforce here
 
04:55:46.190 --> 04:55:46.200 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I was impressed
 
04:55:47.690 --> 04:55:47.700 align:start position:0%
with which I never made the link until
 
04:55:49.190 --> 04:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
04:55:51.530 --> 04:55:51.540 align:start position:0%
was that when students are
 
04:55:54.470 --> 04:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
graduating from high school
 
04:55:56.690 --> 04:55:56.700 align:start position:0%
the next decision they make is going to
 
04:55:59.930 --> 04:55:59.940 align:start position:0%
shape the rest of their life
 
04:56:01.730 --> 04:56:01.740 align:start position:0%
and whether it's going to go to a trade
 
04:56:03.770 --> 04:56:03.780 align:start position:0%
school whether it's going to go to
 
04:56:05.690 --> 04:56:05.700 align:start position:0%
college wherever it's going to be it's
 
04:56:09.170 --> 04:56:09.180 align:start position:0%
going to impact the rest of their life
 
04:56:12.230 --> 04:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me that this requirement
 
04:56:15.830 --> 04:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
to at least look at an option
 
04:56:18.470 --> 04:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
of some financial assistance for the
 
04:56:21.050 --> 04:56:21.060 align:start position:0%
rest of their life
 
04:56:23.448 --> 04:56:23.458 align:start position:0%
this is this is an important thing to
 
04:56:25.970 --> 04:56:25.980 align:start position:0%
have take place here
 
04:56:28.670 --> 04:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
and I think that that we've talked about
 
04:56:30.170 --> 04:56:30.180 align:start position:0%
the waivers
 
04:56:32.270 --> 04:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
people don't have to participate it's
 
04:56:36.050 --> 04:56:36.060 align:start position:0%
very clear you don't have to participate
 
04:56:39.230 --> 04:56:39.240 align:start position:0%
but it also provides an opportunity for
 
04:56:42.590 --> 04:56:42.600 align:start position:0%
a family to have a conversation
 
04:56:45.590 --> 04:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
about what they want to do
 
04:56:47.628 --> 04:56:47.638 align:start position:0%
and in some cases that conversation
 
04:56:50.208 --> 04:56:50.218 align:start position:0%
might not ever take place
 
04:56:53.030 --> 04:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
so I I just think that this uh the bill
 
04:56:56.390 --> 04:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
that we currently have on the books is a
 
04:56:59.510 --> 04:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
very important one for the future of a
 
04:57:02.270 --> 04:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
graduating senior thank you
 
04:57:04.250 --> 04:57:04.260 align:start position:0%
for representative represent Belcher and
 
04:57:06.170 --> 04:57:06.180 align:start position:0%
then representative cardelli
 
04:57:07.610 --> 04:57:07.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just wanted to
 
04:57:09.410 --> 04:57:09.420 align:start position:0%
speak for a moment to the to the waiver
 
04:57:10.970 --> 04:57:10.980 align:start position:0%
concept and we do know with this bill
 
04:57:13.550 --> 04:57:13.560 align:start position:0%
there's three ways to achieve to get
 
04:57:16.610 --> 04:57:16.620 align:start position:0%
past it to get your degree
 
04:57:19.510 --> 04:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
um but a lot has been made of the waiver
 
04:57:23.090 --> 04:57:23.100 align:start position:0%
and a lot has been made of well what if
 
04:57:25.250 --> 04:57:25.260 align:start position:0%
you don't want to sign the waiver
 
04:57:27.590 --> 04:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
and I think it's important for us to
 
04:57:28.810 --> 04:57:28.820 align:start position:0%
remember that
 
04:57:32.150 --> 04:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
the restrictions that exist within our
 
04:57:34.788 --> 04:57:34.798 align:start position:0%
constitution both federal and state are
 
04:57:37.250 --> 04:57:37.260 align:start position:0%
restrictions on what the government is
 
04:57:38.930 --> 04:57:38.940 align:start position:0%
allowed to do
 
04:57:41.330 --> 04:57:41.340 align:start position:0%
and we don't get to tell people
 
04:57:43.670 --> 04:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
oh just sign here even if you don't want
 
04:57:46.310 --> 04:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
to they get to say no they get to set it
 
04:57:48.288 --> 04:57:48.298 align:start position:0%
up yours whatever they want
 
04:57:50.628 --> 04:57:50.638 align:start position:0%
they get to do that and we don't get to
 
04:57:52.730 --> 04:57:52.740 align:start position:0%
tell them otherwise and the idea that
 
04:57:55.368 --> 04:57:55.378 align:start position:0%
we're going to withhold a degree or for
 
04:57:56.570 --> 04:57:56.580 align:start position:0%
those who would argue we won't actually
 
04:57:58.190 --> 04:57:58.200 align:start position:0%
withhold it we'll just jump through some
 
04:57:59.810 --> 04:57:59.820 align:start position:0%
hopes and give it to them anyway well
 
04:58:02.868 --> 04:58:02.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:06.590 --> 04:58:06.600 align:start position:0%
thank you represent cordelli uh thank
 
04:58:10.430 --> 04:58:10.440 align:start position:0%
you uh I would just point out that uh I
 
04:58:12.490 --> 04:58:12.500 align:start position:0%
think there is nothing preventing
 
04:58:15.590 --> 04:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
families from looking at this now and
 
04:58:17.390 --> 04:58:17.400 align:start position:0%
having a conversation about Direction
 
04:58:19.730 --> 04:58:19.740 align:start position:0%
without the government telling them that
 
04:58:22.250 --> 04:58:22.260 align:start position:0%
they have to
 
04:58:24.948 --> 04:58:24.958 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
04:58:27.410 --> 04:58:27.420 align:start position:0%
yes represent cascadden um in written
 
04:58:32.150 --> 04:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
just in reviewing the RSA 193 26 8.
 
04:58:34.730 --> 04:58:34.740 align:start position:0%
it starts with that that opening
 
04:58:37.310 --> 04:58:37.320 align:start position:0%
paragraph that everybody must
 
04:58:39.170 --> 04:58:39.180 align:start position:0%
but as you read through the parts of the
 
04:58:41.270 --> 04:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
law it's if applicable
 
04:58:43.788 --> 04:58:43.798 align:start position:0%
so families don't want to fill out the
 
04:58:46.128 --> 04:58:46.138 align:start position:0%
fashion they don't fill out the fashion
 
04:58:48.830 --> 04:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
so it's if applicable so I I don't see
 
04:58:53.150 --> 04:58:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:56.150 --> 04:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
for the discussion represent leckis
 
04:58:57.948 --> 04:58:57.958 align:start position:0%
if the bill doesn't actually do anything
 
04:59:02.150 --> 04:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
why do we have it I mean the law
 
04:59:03.590 --> 04:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
um because you heard with the
 
04:59:05.628 --> 04:59:05.638 align:start position:0%
superintendent said we never stop
 
04:59:07.610 --> 04:59:07.620 align:start position:0%
anybody from graduating
 
04:59:09.650 --> 04:59:09.660 align:start position:0%
and I can tell you that my best friends
 
04:59:12.350 --> 04:59:12.360 align:start position:0%
my daughter's best friend her mom
 
04:59:14.628 --> 04:59:14.638 align:start position:0%
wouldn't fill out anything for anything
 
04:59:17.810 --> 04:59:17.820 align:start position:0%
anything permission whatever she would
 
04:59:19.788 --> 04:59:19.798 align:start position:0%
not have filled this out but the school
 
04:59:22.190 --> 04:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
knew her and they would have just no
 
04:59:24.708 --> 04:59:24.718 align:start position:0%
problem well why do we have it if we're
 
04:59:27.050 --> 04:59:27.060 align:start position:0%
just no problem if we're not going to
 
04:59:28.970 --> 04:59:28.980 align:start position:0%
keep anybody from graduating anyways
 
04:59:31.670 --> 04:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
like the superintendent said
 
04:59:33.470 --> 04:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
there's no point in this law to begin
 
04:59:37.430 --> 04:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:41.628 --> 04:59:41.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:43.490 --> 04:59:43.500 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that the purpose
 
04:59:46.250 --> 04:59:46.260 align:start position:0%
of this law is so that students who
 
04:59:48.610 --> 04:59:48.620 align:start position:0%
would not otherwise
 
04:59:51.230 --> 04:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
recognize the benefit the potential
 
04:59:51.240 --> 04:59:52.490 align:start position:0%
recognize the benefit the potential
benefit

04:59:52.490 --> 04:59:52.500 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
04:59:54.650 --> 04:59:54.660 align:start position:0%
of filling out the FAFSA and finding out
 
04:59:57.350 --> 04:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
that they've in fact could afford to go
 
04:59:58.970 --> 04:59:58.980 align:start position:0%
to college
 
05:00:01.250 --> 05:00:01.260 align:start position:0%
would have the opportunity of that
 
05:00:04.128 --> 05:00:04.138 align:start position:0%
learning I think we're asking
 
05:00:07.368 --> 05:00:07.378 align:start position:0%
people to make a very small effort
 
05:00:10.070 --> 05:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
to if they don't want to fill out the
 
05:00:13.128 --> 05:00:13.138 align:start position:0%
FAFSA to sign the waiver form
 
05:00:16.670 --> 05:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
so that all individuals
 
05:00:19.128 --> 05:00:19.138 align:start position:0%
can determine whether it is a reasonable
 
05:00:22.670 --> 05:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
pathway for them to go to higher ed
 
05:00:24.890 --> 05:00:24.900 align:start position:0%
I had a number of personal experiences
 
05:00:29.628 --> 05:00:29.638 align:start position:0%
in my career counseling nutrition and
 
05:00:32.330 --> 05:00:32.340 align:start position:0%
health issues with teenagers
 
05:00:34.550 --> 05:00:34.560 align:start position:0%
and I am going to just particularly note
 
05:00:37.128 --> 05:00:37.138 align:start position:0%
an experience with a young woman very
 
05:00:39.230 --> 05:00:39.240 align:start position:0%
very bright
 
05:00:41.270 --> 05:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
not at all intending to go to college
 
05:00:43.670 --> 05:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
and I got to know her quite well over a
 
05:00:45.708 --> 05:00:45.718 align:start position:0%
course of a couple years
 
05:00:48.530 --> 05:00:48.540 align:start position:0%
and along the way said so why aren't you
 
05:00:50.150 --> 05:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
considering College
 
05:00:53.990 --> 05:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:56.150 --> 05:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
I had a collaborative relationship with
 
05:00:58.430 --> 05:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
her mom and I persuaded her mom to fill
 
05:01:00.650 --> 05:01:00.660 align:start position:0%
out the paths very reluctantly because
 
05:01:02.810 --> 05:01:02.820 align:start position:0%
she was in fact concerned that family
 
05:01:05.510 --> 05:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
privacies would be violated
 
05:01:09.110 --> 05:01:09.120 align:start position:0%
I was a PhD now she is benefiting other
 
05:01:09.120 --> 05:01:10.128 align:start position:0%
I was a PhD now she is benefiting other
people

05:01:10.128 --> 05:01:10.138 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:01:12.410 --> 05:01:12.420 align:start position:0%
when she was two years into college she
 
05:01:14.208 --> 05:01:14.218 align:start position:0%
called me and said I just want to let
 
05:01:16.010 --> 05:01:16.020 align:start position:0%
you know my mom filled out the FAFSA for
 
05:01:17.750 --> 05:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
my brother today
 
05:01:19.910 --> 05:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
it's so little that we are asking people
 
05:01:24.890 --> 05:01:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:26.570 --> 05:01:26.580 align:start position:0%
represent Des Moines
 
05:01:30.530 --> 05:01:30.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair since 1769 when
 
05:01:32.628 --> 05:01:32.638 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth opened its doors people have
 
05:01:34.368 --> 05:01:34.378 align:start position:0%
been going to college and figuring out a
 
05:01:35.570 --> 05:01:35.580 align:start position:0%
way to pay
 
05:01:38.030 --> 05:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
they can get scholarships career
 
05:01:40.010 --> 05:01:40.020 align:start position:0%
guidance counselors in the school guide
 
05:01:42.708 --> 05:01:42.718 align:start position:0%
them to where they can apply there are
 
05:01:46.010 --> 05:01:46.020 align:start position:0%
books this thick that I used with my
 
05:01:47.390 --> 05:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
children when they applied for
 
05:01:51.350 --> 05:01:51.360 align:start position:0%
Scholarships in order to go to college
 
05:01:55.310 --> 05:01:55.320 align:start position:0%
and I I don't see why we should have
 
05:01:57.410 --> 05:01:57.420 align:start position:0%
FAFSA that says if you don't fill out
 
05:01:58.970 --> 05:01:58.980 align:start position:0%
this form you're not going to graduate
 
05:02:02.750 --> 05:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:05.690 --> 05:02:05.700 align:start position:0%
further discussion from the committee
 
05:02:08.930 --> 05:02:08.940 align:start position:0%
representative I'm sorry Mr chair but
 
05:02:11.208 --> 05:02:11.218 align:start position:0%
one more comment
 
05:02:13.430 --> 05:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
um several years ago
 
05:02:17.208 --> 05:02:17.218 align:start position:0%
this committee uh supported
 
05:02:19.368 --> 05:02:19.378 align:start position:0%
high school students taking the SAT
 
05:02:22.250 --> 05:02:22.260 align:start position:0%
scores that was new to the state
 
05:02:23.990 --> 05:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
and one of the reasons why we did that
 
05:02:25.850 --> 05:02:25.860 align:start position:0%
is that one the other
 
05:02:27.530 --> 05:02:27.540 align:start position:0%
tests that they were taking was really
 
05:02:29.810 --> 05:02:29.820 align:start position:0%
taking Fair lightly and kids didn't
 
05:02:31.368 --> 05:02:31.378 align:start position:0%
really like to take it
 
05:02:34.310 --> 05:02:34.320 align:start position:0%
but one of the motives for the SAT
 
05:02:37.310 --> 05:02:37.320 align:start position:0%
was that students who take the SAT and
 
05:02:39.170 --> 05:02:39.180 align:start position:0%
score higher than they thought they
 
05:02:39.180 --> 05:02:40.010 align:start position:0%
score higher than they thought they
would

05:02:40.010 --> 05:02:40.020 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:02:42.770 --> 05:02:42.780 align:start position:0%
gives them an indication says hey maybe
 
05:02:45.288 --> 05:02:45.298 align:start position:0%
this is for me to go on to a
 
05:02:47.330 --> 05:02:47.340 align:start position:0%
post-secondary school
 
05:02:49.970 --> 05:02:49.980 align:start position:0%
and when they took those tests what we
 
05:02:52.368 --> 05:02:52.378 align:start position:0%
did find is that more kids did in fact
 
05:02:54.830 --> 05:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
decide to go on to post-secondary
 
05:02:58.310 --> 05:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
education I view this form in a very
 
05:03:00.890 --> 05:03:00.900 align:start position:0%
similar kind of a way as those kids
 
05:03:03.470 --> 05:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
taking the SAT and realizing that there
 
05:03:05.150 --> 05:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
is a pathway for them that they might
 
05:03:06.590 --> 05:03:06.600 align:start position:0%
not have thought about
 
05:03:09.410 --> 05:03:09.420 align:start position:0%
so that's why I will not support this
 
05:03:09.420 --> 05:03:11.690 align:start position:0%
so that's why I will not support this

chair I'm on the same lines it hasn't
 
05:03:19.490 --> 05:03:19.500 align:start position:0%
even gone into effect yet so we don't
 
05:03:23.448 --> 05:03:23.458 align:start position:0%
know what what will happen so I would
 
05:03:26.330 --> 05:03:26.340 align:start position:0%
rather wait and see what happens I mean
 
05:03:29.570 --> 05:03:29.580 align:start position:0%
it could have a good effect nobody knows

OTP on SB 136.
 
05:04:54.770 --> 05:04:54.780 align:start position:0%
for those in the public this is a bill
 
05:04:56.270 --> 05:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the employment or
 
05:04:59.030 --> 05:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
volunteering of a revoked or suspended
 
05:04:59.040 --> 05:05:00.470 align:start position:0%
volunteering of a revoked or suspended
educator

05:05:00.470 --> 05:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
educator
 
05:05:03.530 --> 05:05:03.540 align:start position:0%
much different than FAFSA
 
05:05:05.868 --> 05:05:05.878 align:start position:0%
so here we are back with the original
 
05:05:05.878 --> 05:05:07.430 align:start position:0%
so here we are back with the original
motion

05:05:07.430 --> 05:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
motion
 
05:05:10.550 --> 05:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
the motion is ought to pass is there any
 
05:05:15.288 --> 05:05:15.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:17.830 --> 05:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
yes reps yeah go ahead
 
05:05:20.750 --> 05:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
represent yeah just just reviewing the
 
05:05:22.850 --> 05:05:22.860 align:start position:0%
bidding a bit um I just want to make the
 
05:05:27.850 --> 05:05:27.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:30.110 --> 05:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
that were offered or anything like that
 
05:05:32.948 --> 05:05:32.958 align:start position:0%
back when I mean I just wanna
 
05:05:35.208 --> 05:05:35.218 align:start position:0%
I don't believe we had any other
 
05:05:37.610 --> 05:05:37.620 align:start position:0%
amendments on it it's clean it's 136.
 
05:05:39.830 --> 05:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's just clean it had one sponsor
 
05:05:41.570 --> 05:05:41.580 align:start position:0%
on it from the Senate and that was it
 
05:05:41.580 --> 05:05:44.570 align:start position:0%
on it from the Senate and that was it
yep

05:05:44.570 --> 05:05:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:46.250 --> 05:05:46.260 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
05:05:48.350 --> 05:05:48.360 align:start position:0%
Belcher did you have a yes Mr chair I
 
05:05:50.208 --> 05:05:50.218 align:start position:0%
just wanted to bring up a small concern
 
05:05:53.570 --> 05:05:53.580 align:start position:0%
I had briefly about the the nature of
 
05:05:56.390 --> 05:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
adding of including private sector
 
05:05:59.208 --> 05:05:59.218 align:start position:0%
schools in this bill because I can
 
05:06:01.490 --> 05:06:01.500 align:start position:0%
reasonably foresee a future given what
 
05:06:04.010 --> 05:06:04.020 align:start position:0%
we know about cancel culture where a
 
05:06:05.810 --> 05:06:05.820 align:start position:0%
student or a rather a teacher could be
 
05:06:09.410 --> 05:06:09.420 align:start position:0%
suspended for relatively trivial and
 
05:06:12.170 --> 05:06:12.180 align:start position:0%
non-education and non nothing that would
 
05:06:13.788 --> 05:06:13.798 align:start position:0%
make them a danger or what not to any
 
05:06:16.070 --> 05:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
students who might then want to move on
 
05:06:17.390 --> 05:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
to the private sector and this bill
 
05:06:19.670 --> 05:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
would therefore prohibit that from
 
05:06:22.070 --> 05:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
happening under this uh under this
 
05:06:24.650 --> 05:06:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:27.770 --> 05:06:27.780 align:start position:0%
is there any discussion represent Tanner
 
05:06:31.010 --> 05:06:31.020 align:start position:0%
I would just say that my understanding
 
05:06:32.628 --> 05:06:32.638 align:start position:0%
and my hope would be that somebody
 
05:06:34.490 --> 05:06:34.500 align:start position:0%
that's suspended or loses their
 
05:06:34.500 --> 05:06:35.510 align:start position:0%
that's suspended or loses their
credential

05:06:35.510 --> 05:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
credential
 
05:06:36.830 --> 05:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
does so
 
05:06:39.530 --> 05:06:39.540 align:start position:0%
for a very important reason because
 
05:06:41.510 --> 05:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
that's their livelihood
 
05:06:44.930 --> 05:06:44.940 align:start position:0%
and they're professional and uh it isn't
 
05:06:47.868 --> 05:06:47.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:47.878 --> 05:06:51.410 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:06:51.410 --> 05:06:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:54.170 --> 05:06:54.180 align:start position:0%
if a person for example wanted to work
 
05:06:56.990 --> 05:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
or teach in a private school
 
05:07:00.230 --> 05:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
that did not require a credential this
 
05:07:02.030 --> 05:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
bill would not prevent that person from
 
05:07:06.050 --> 05:07:06.060 align:start position:0%
doing so because it talks about a
 
05:07:10.250 --> 05:07:10.260 align:start position:0%
a revoked or suspended educator and then
 
05:07:12.230 --> 05:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
it also says
 
05:07:12.240 --> 05:07:13.310 align:start position:0%
it also says
um

05:07:13.310 --> 05:07:13.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:16.070 --> 05:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
not hire any individual whose credential
 
05:07:18.890 --> 05:07:18.900 align:start position:0%
issued by the department is currently
 
05:07:23.448 --> 05:07:23.458 align:start position:0%
suspended or revoked but if it doesn't
 
05:07:25.970 --> 05:07:25.980 align:start position:0%
like to me there's a little ambiguity in
 
05:07:27.470 --> 05:07:27.480 align:start position:0%
terms of if a person want to come out
 
05:07:30.830 --> 05:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
and work as be employed as a
 
05:07:34.730 --> 05:07:34.740 align:start position:0%
on in a job that did not require
 
05:07:36.650 --> 05:07:36.660 align:start position:0%
the credential
 
05:07:39.110 --> 05:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
uh maybe that's something we need to
 
05:07:41.090 --> 05:07:41.100 align:start position:0%
discuss here but uh
 
05:07:43.190 --> 05:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
I thought it also said that they
 
05:07:44.930 --> 05:07:44.940 align:start position:0%
couldn't be hired as a volunteer which
 
05:07:48.350 --> 05:07:48.360 align:start position:0%
kind of to me indicates that uh it you
 
05:07:50.448 --> 05:07:50.458 align:start position:0%
don't it doesn't have it isn't a direct
 
05:07:52.128 --> 05:07:52.138 align:start position:0%
correlation to your credential it's
 
05:07:54.890 --> 05:07:54.900 align:start position:0%
working with children and one of our
 
05:07:57.410 --> 05:07:57.420 align:start position:0%
most important things is to keep Kids
 
05:08:00.230 --> 05:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
Safe whether it's private school public
 
05:08:02.510 --> 05:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
school camps
 
05:08:07.010 --> 05:08:07.020 align:start position:0%
um and uh I just think that that uh it
 
05:08:09.170 --> 05:08:09.180 align:start position:0%
it goes beyond saying that that we
 
05:08:11.270 --> 05:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
should have this as
 
05:08:13.250 --> 05:08:13.260 align:start position:0%
um as many under this umbrella as
 
05:08:13.260 --> 05:08:15.470 align:start position:0%
um as many under this umbrella as
possible

05:08:15.470 --> 05:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
possible
 
05:08:18.890 --> 05:08:18.900 align:start position:0%
further discussion this representative
 
05:08:21.410 --> 05:08:21.420 align:start position:0%
my question and it has to do with what
 
05:08:24.110 --> 05:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
is going on today
 
05:08:25.970 --> 05:08:25.980 align:start position:0%
um if a teacher
 
05:08:30.770 --> 05:08:30.780 align:start position:0%
will not do what her administrator
 
05:08:33.770 --> 05:08:33.780 align:start position:0%
has said that she had to do would she
 
05:08:37.610 --> 05:08:37.620 align:start position:0%
not were he not be
 
05:08:41.868 --> 05:08:41.878 align:start position:0%
um potentially have their
 
05:08:41.878 --> 05:08:43.430 align:start position:0%
um potentially have their
certification

05:08:43.430 --> 05:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
certification
 
05:08:46.190 --> 05:08:46.200 align:start position:0%
taken away word
 
05:08:48.970 --> 05:08:48.980 align:start position:0%
I don't know it's not Disobedience but
 
05:08:51.410 --> 05:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
insubordination whatever at any rate and
 
05:08:54.650 --> 05:08:54.660 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking of for instance things that
 
05:08:56.570 --> 05:08:56.580 align:start position:0%
we've dealt with already this year and
 
05:08:57.948 --> 05:08:57.958 align:start position:0%
last year
 
05:09:00.770 --> 05:09:00.780 align:start position:0%
if the superintendent says which some of
 
05:09:01.850 --> 05:09:01.860 align:start position:0%
them do
 
05:09:04.850 --> 05:09:04.860 align:start position:0%
you will be teaching Dei in all of your
 
05:09:08.270 --> 05:09:08.280 align:start position:0%
classes not as a curriculum but you will
 
05:09:10.310 --> 05:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
work it in to everything and a teacher
 
05:09:12.770 --> 05:09:12.780 align:start position:0%
says no I'm not going to do that or the
 
05:09:15.650 --> 05:09:15.660 align:start position:0%
school says you will lie to parents when
 
05:09:17.868 --> 05:09:17.878 align:start position:0%
they ask you specifically
 
05:09:17.878 --> 05:09:19.490 align:start position:0%
they ask you specifically
about

05:09:19.490 --> 05:09:19.500 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:09:22.090 --> 05:09:22.100 align:start position:0%
what names your child goes by at school
 
05:09:26.230 --> 05:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
unless you unless you have documentation
 
05:09:29.708 --> 05:09:29.718 align:start position:0%
no no no no I think it's totally
 
05:09:32.570 --> 05:09:32.580 align:start position:0%
uncalled to recognize you no no I I
 
05:09:35.330 --> 05:09:35.340 align:start position:0%
don't think what she's saying and what's
 
05:09:38.270 --> 05:09:38.280 align:start position:0%
going out paints teachers in such a bad
 
05:09:40.910 --> 05:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
light or or puts the thought out there
 
05:09:43.670 --> 05:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
the of the deception the teacher that
 
05:09:46.610 --> 05:09:46.620 align:start position:0%
this is going on then unless you have
 
05:09:49.010 --> 05:09:49.020 align:start position:0%
proof of that I don't think we should
 
05:09:50.810 --> 05:09:50.820 align:start position:0%
entertain sitting here and listening to
 
05:09:53.990 --> 05:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
it I I excuse me but we have had
 
05:09:56.750 --> 05:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
teachers testify that they were asked to
 
05:09:59.570 --> 05:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
do that and they did not want to and so
 
05:10:01.910 --> 05:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
my question is if they refuse to do that
 
05:10:04.430 --> 05:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
will they have their licenses revoked
 
05:10:06.350 --> 05:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
and then not be able to get another job
 
05:10:08.390 --> 05:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
cut in right here the we're talking
 
05:10:10.670 --> 05:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
about revoking or suspending a
 
05:10:10.680 --> 05:10:11.868 align:start position:0%
about revoking or suspending a
credential

05:10:11.868 --> 05:10:11.878 align:start position:0%
credential
 
05:10:15.948 --> 05:10:15.958 align:start position:0%
I for the topic we're talking about I
 
05:10:19.610 --> 05:10:19.620 align:start position:0%
would question whether the certificate
 
05:10:22.850 --> 05:10:22.860 align:start position:0%
um so uh attorney Fenton
 
05:10:31.510 --> 05:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:31.520 --> 05:10:33.170 align:start position:0%
 
actually

05:10:33.170 --> 05:10:33.180 align:start position:0%
actually
 
05:10:35.510 --> 05:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
I didn't really need to go down this
 
05:10:44.208 --> 05:10:44.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:46.128 --> 05:10:46.138 align:start position:0%
we know we have the code of ethics and
 
05:10:49.670 --> 05:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
code of you know uh conduct
 
05:10:49.680 --> 05:10:50.690 align:start position:0%
code of you know uh conduct
um

05:10:50.690 --> 05:10:50.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:53.750 --> 05:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
the topic we're talking about here is
 
05:10:56.868 --> 05:10:56.878 align:start position:0%
refusing to teach something
 
05:10:59.208 --> 05:10:59.218 align:start position:0%
that may be in your curriculum or your
 
05:11:01.670 --> 05:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
that's against your conscience is that
 
05:11:03.650 --> 05:11:03.660 align:start position:0%
something that's worthy of yanking a
 
05:11:03.660 --> 05:11:05.270 align:start position:0%
something that's worthy of yanking a
certificate

05:11:05.270 --> 05:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
certificate
 
05:11:07.070 --> 05:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
good afternoon for the record my name is
 
05:11:08.570 --> 05:11:08.580 align:start position:0%
Diana Fenton I'm an attorney with the
 
05:11:11.208 --> 05:11:11.218 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to answer your
 
05:11:11.218 --> 05:11:12.410 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to answer your
question

05:11:12.410 --> 05:11:12.420 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:11:15.890 --> 05:11:15.900 align:start position:0%
no the short answer is is no
 
05:11:18.770 --> 05:11:18.780 align:start position:0%
um the department has not taken action
 
05:11:20.650 --> 05:11:20.660 align:start position:0%
in that instance that would be
 
05:11:22.368 --> 05:11:22.378 align:start position:0%
insubordination that would be an
 
05:11:24.890 --> 05:11:24.900 align:start position:0%
employment issue and there is a
 
05:11:26.810 --> 05:11:26.820 align:start position:0%
significant distinction between
 
05:11:29.448 --> 05:11:29.458 align:start position:0%
employment issues and credentialing
 
05:11:32.390 --> 05:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
issues and there are a host of things
 
05:11:34.510 --> 05:11:34.520 align:start position:0%
that happen at a school district
 
05:11:37.810 --> 05:11:37.820 align:start position:0%
that fall outside of the Department's
 
05:11:37.820 --> 05:11:40.030 align:start position:0%
that fall outside of the Department's
purview

05:11:40.030 --> 05:11:40.040 align:start position:0%
purview
 
05:11:43.010 --> 05:11:43.020 align:start position:0%
and I can think of
 
05:11:45.948 --> 05:11:45.958 align:start position:0%
you know dress code issues not showing
 
05:11:49.070 --> 05:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
up on time for your job classroom
 
05:11:51.730 --> 05:11:51.740 align:start position:0%
management issues curriculum issues
 
05:11:55.368 --> 05:11:55.378 align:start position:0%
those are are not those do not fall
 
05:11:57.230 --> 05:11:57.240 align:start position:0%
within this document which was passed by
 
05:12:00.050 --> 05:12:00.060 align:start position:0%
this legislative body in House Bill 210
 
05:12:03.948 --> 05:12:03.958 align:start position:0%
in in 2016 or 2017.
 
05:12:07.490 --> 05:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
this document here is very narrowly
 
05:12:07.500 --> 05:12:08.750 align:start position:0%
this document here is very narrowly
construed

05:12:08.750 --> 05:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
construed
 
05:12:12.110 --> 05:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
it was designed by House Bill 210 to be
 
05:12:14.208 --> 05:12:14.218 align:start position:0%
very narrowly construed and the rules
 
05:12:16.788 --> 05:12:16.798 align:start position:0%
were written to really address instances
 
05:12:19.690 --> 05:12:19.700 align:start position:0%
where educators are having inappropriate
 
05:12:22.490 --> 05:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
relationships with students and that's
 
05:12:24.230 --> 05:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
the type of behavior that the department
 
05:12:26.690 --> 05:12:26.700 align:start position:0%
is able to say we don't want this
 
05:12:29.868 --> 05:12:29.878 align:start position:0%
individual who is harming a child in
 
05:12:32.708 --> 05:12:32.718 align:start position:0%
District a to then go into District B
 
05:12:35.390 --> 05:12:35.400 align:start position:0%
but other issues that fall within
 
05:12:38.570 --> 05:12:38.580 align:start position:0%
employment classroom management
 
05:12:41.448 --> 05:12:41.458 align:start position:0%
not showing up on time those are all
 
05:12:43.490 --> 05:12:43.500 align:start position:0%
employment issues and the department
 
05:12:46.010 --> 05:12:46.020 align:start position:0%
stands back and those will be handled at
 
05:12:48.170 --> 05:12:48.180 align:start position:0%
the local level thank you very much for
 
05:12:49.788 --> 05:12:49.798 align:start position:0%
answering my question thank you for the
 
05:12:52.010 --> 05:12:52.020 align:start position:0%
opportunity I appreciate it
 
05:12:54.170 --> 05:12:54.180 align:start position:0%
while we have attorney Fenton there is
 
05:12:56.510 --> 05:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
there any other yes represent Belcher
 
05:12:58.128 --> 05:12:58.138 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for being
 
05:12:59.810 --> 05:12:59.820 align:start position:0%
here for this um
 
05:13:02.150 --> 05:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
so we've heard the precedent what
 
05:13:03.830 --> 05:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
currently happens do you are you aware
 
05:13:05.990 --> 05:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
of anything in statute that would
 
05:13:07.368 --> 05:13:07.378 align:start position:0%
prevent a hypothetical future
 
05:13:10.430 --> 05:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
Administration from changing their
 
05:13:13.250 --> 05:13:13.260 align:start position:0%
executive policies such that a teacher
 
05:13:15.490 --> 05:13:15.500 align:start position:0%
could be or could lose their credential
 
05:13:18.410 --> 05:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
under such circumstances is it a
 
05:13:21.110 --> 05:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
theoretical possibility legally
 
05:13:25.550 --> 05:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
you know is it possible sure anything's
 
05:13:27.890 --> 05:13:27.900 align:start position:0%
possible but the way it's structured is
 
05:13:30.050 --> 05:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
you have the law which was House Bill
 
05:13:33.770 --> 05:13:33.780 align:start position:0%
210 and that changed RSA 21n9 and that
 
05:13:36.110 --> 05:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
set out four parameters four principles
 
05:13:39.350 --> 05:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
that the code of conduct had to entail
 
05:13:42.350 --> 05:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
and based on that there that law also
 
05:13:44.750 --> 05:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
required rule making Authority and
 
05:13:47.390 --> 05:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
that's how this document came to be and
 
05:13:50.510 --> 05:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
I apologize for the battered copy here I
 
05:13:53.270 --> 05:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
I thought I had a newer copy
 
05:13:56.270 --> 05:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner I'll get you copy
 
05:13:56.280 --> 05:13:57.110 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner I'll get you copy
um

05:13:57.110 --> 05:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:59.510 --> 05:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
and that's how the rules came out now
 
05:14:02.208 --> 05:14:02.218 align:start position:0%
could the rules be be opened and
 
05:14:04.368 --> 05:14:04.378 align:start position:0%
Rewritten of course it could be that's
 
05:14:06.170 --> 05:14:06.180 align:start position:0%
part of the process every 10 years the
 
05:14:08.690 --> 05:14:08.700 align:start position:0%
rules are opened however
 
05:14:11.090 --> 05:14:11.100 align:start position:0%
and now could the rules be be opened and
 
05:14:13.430 --> 05:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
Rewritten under a new Administration yes
 
05:14:14.628 --> 05:14:14.638 align:start position:0%
they could be
 
05:14:17.570 --> 05:14:17.580 align:start position:0%
the way they are written now
 
05:14:19.670 --> 05:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
um we do have
 
05:14:21.890 --> 05:14:21.900 align:start position:0%
um something called administrative gloss
 
05:14:23.390 --> 05:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
an administrative glass is something
 
05:14:24.530 --> 05:14:24.540 align:start position:0%
that I learned from the Attorney
 
05:14:26.150 --> 05:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
General's office when I started at the
 
05:14:28.430 --> 05:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Education which is how a
 
05:14:30.410 --> 05:14:30.420 align:start position:0%
department has interpreted prior rules
 
05:14:31.850 --> 05:14:31.860 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
05:14:34.970 --> 05:14:34.980 align:start position:0%
to carry forward now how that is
 
05:14:34.980 --> 05:14:37.550 align:start position:0%
to carry forward now how that is
enforced

05:14:37.550 --> 05:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
enforced
 
05:14:39.470 --> 05:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
I guess is anyone's guess but I know
 
05:14:40.610 --> 05:14:40.620 align:start position:0%
that that is something that we've
 
05:14:41.690 --> 05:14:41.700 align:start position:0%
learned from the Attorney General's
 
05:14:43.670 --> 05:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
office is in theory a new commissioner
 
05:14:45.770 --> 05:14:45.780 align:start position:0%
can't come in and just suddenly say I
 
05:14:47.390 --> 05:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
know this is how the rules have been
 
05:14:48.650 --> 05:14:48.660 align:start position:0%
interpreted in the past and we're going
 
05:14:50.628 --> 05:14:50.638 align:start position:0%
to go in a different direction and so
 
05:14:52.430 --> 05:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
that would be my answer to your question
 
05:14:55.250 --> 05:14:55.260 align:start position:0%
is I would I would argue administrative
 
05:14:57.350 --> 05:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
gloss has dictated how the department
 
05:15:00.110 --> 05:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
has interpreted those rules previously
 
05:15:03.170 --> 05:15:03.180 align:start position:0%
and that should carry forward
 
05:15:05.750 --> 05:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
if I may just to follow up on the other
 
05:15:07.250 --> 05:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
issue that just came up because I think
 
05:15:08.990 --> 05:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
it's directly pertinent to this they're
 
05:15:11.030 --> 05:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
argument about a possible future where a
 
05:15:13.368 --> 05:15:13.378 align:start position:0%
teacher could lose their license for for
 
05:15:15.650 --> 05:15:15.660 align:start position:0%
instance insubordination refusing to do
 
05:15:17.570 --> 05:15:17.580 align:start position:0%
something that they're um that they're
 
05:15:19.730 --> 05:15:19.740 align:start position:0%
told or required if I could just for a
 
05:15:23.510 --> 05:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
moment read from the uh school policies
 
05:15:25.550 --> 05:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
from my school district the Paul School
 
05:15:28.670 --> 05:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
in Wakefield under privacy when it comes
 
05:15:31.010 --> 05:15:31.020 align:start position:0%
to transgender students the board
 
05:15:32.448 --> 05:15:32.458 align:start position:0%
recognizes the student's right to keep
 
05:15:34.310 --> 05:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
private once gender status or gender
 
05:15:35.930 --> 05:15:35.940 align:start position:0%
non-conforming presentation at school
 
05:15:37.730 --> 05:15:37.740 align:start position:0%
information about a student's
 
05:15:39.530 --> 05:15:39.540 align:start position:0%
transgender status legal name or gender
 
05:15:41.350 --> 05:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
assigned to birth may also constitute
 
05:15:43.730 --> 05:15:43.740 align:start position:0%
confidential information School
 
05:15:44.990 --> 05:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
Personnel should not disclose
 
05:15:46.970 --> 05:15:46.980 align:start position:0%
information that may reveal a student's
 
05:15:48.170 --> 05:15:48.180 align:start position:0%
transgender status or gender
 
05:15:49.990 --> 05:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
non-conforming presentation to others
 
05:15:52.490 --> 05:15:52.500 align:start position:0%
including parents
 
05:15:55.970 --> 05:15:55.980 align:start position:0%
would you categorize that as possibly
 
05:15:58.850 --> 05:15:58.860 align:start position:0%
requiring parents to be dishonest to
 
05:15:58.860 --> 05:16:02.570 align:start position:0%
requiring parents to be dishonest to
parents

05:16:02.570 --> 05:16:02.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:04.730 --> 05:16:04.740 align:start position:0%
yeah you know because if we're talking
 
05:16:06.708 --> 05:16:06.718 align:start position:0%
credentials credentials
 
05:16:08.330 --> 05:16:08.340 align:start position:0%
are not related what you were saying
 
05:16:10.970 --> 05:16:10.980 align:start position:0%
right there that would be an employment
 
05:16:12.650 --> 05:16:12.660 align:start position:0%
issue yeah that's an employment issue
 
05:16:15.170 --> 05:16:15.180 align:start position:0%
100 every school district is going to
 
05:16:16.730 --> 05:16:16.740 align:start position:0%
have their own policies for employment
 
05:16:16.740 --> 05:16:17.930 align:start position:0%
have their own policies for employment
purposes

05:16:17.930 --> 05:16:17.940 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
05:16:19.910 --> 05:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
um I mean the example I always give is
 
05:16:22.190 --> 05:16:22.200 align:start position:0%
I'm licensed to practice law by the
 
05:16:24.050 --> 05:16:24.060 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire I'm employed by
 
05:16:26.330 --> 05:16:26.340 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
 
05:16:30.110 --> 05:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
and there are a ton of State policies
 
05:16:33.110 --> 05:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
that I could violate which would affect
 
05:16:35.690 --> 05:16:35.700 align:start position:0%
my employment but do those rise to the
 
05:16:37.250 --> 05:16:37.260 align:start position:0%
level of affecting
 
05:16:38.868 --> 05:16:38.878 align:start position:0%
um the Integrity with which I hold that
 
05:16:41.690 --> 05:16:41.700 align:start position:0%
law license no they don't
 
05:16:44.810 --> 05:16:44.820 align:start position:0%
they simply don't so
 
05:16:46.910 --> 05:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
um I also wanted to address the issue
 
05:16:48.050 --> 05:16:48.060 align:start position:0%
that was raised by yourself
 
05:16:50.150 --> 05:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
representative private schools lad about
 
05:16:52.430 --> 05:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
private schools and I will remind this
 
05:16:54.708 --> 05:16:54.718 align:start position:0%
committee that I had the rare uh
 
05:16:56.628 --> 05:16:56.638 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify in front of this
 
05:16:59.150 --> 05:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
committee with Megan Tuttle president of
 
05:17:01.550 --> 05:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
Nea on this particular Bill and and I
 
05:17:02.690 --> 05:17:02.700 align:start position:0%
think it's really important to remind
 
05:17:04.910 --> 05:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
the committee that Nea supported this
 
05:17:07.250 --> 05:17:07.260 align:start position:0%
bill and it was a pleasure to testify
 
05:17:08.930 --> 05:17:08.940 align:start position:0%
with Megan Tuttle I wish it happened
 
05:17:10.430 --> 05:17:10.440 align:start position:0%
more often
 
05:17:10.440 --> 05:17:11.090 align:start position:0%
more often
um

05:17:11.090 --> 05:17:11.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:14.570 --> 05:17:14.580 align:start position:0%
to be honest with you uh so we did
 
05:17:16.970 --> 05:17:16.980 align:start position:0%
include and it is the intent of this
 
05:17:18.530 --> 05:17:18.540 align:start position:0%
bill with my understanding of the intent
 
05:17:20.270 --> 05:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
of this bill uh which I think was
 
05:17:22.368 --> 05:17:22.378 align:start position:0%
sponsored by representative Miler to
 
05:17:25.730 --> 05:17:25.740 align:start position:0%
include private schools
 
05:17:29.150 --> 05:17:29.160 align:start position:0%
um and the reason we wanted to do that
 
05:17:32.090 --> 05:17:32.100 align:start position:0%
was because as the department has said
 
05:17:33.170 --> 05:17:33.180 align:start position:0%
all along
 
05:17:35.690 --> 05:17:35.700 align:start position:0%
you know child safety issues it's not a
 
05:17:37.250 --> 05:17:37.260 align:start position:0%
zip code issue
 
05:17:40.970 --> 05:17:40.980 align:start position:0%
it's it's not a zip code concern I think
 
05:17:42.650 --> 05:17:42.660 align:start position:0%
everyone on this committee can can agree
 
05:17:44.868 --> 05:17:44.878 align:start position:0%
to that and the same thought when with
 
05:17:47.030 --> 05:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
with private schools that if we have an
 
05:17:51.708 --> 05:17:51.718 align:start position:0%
individual who we are concerned
 
05:17:53.868 --> 05:17:53.878 align:start position:0%
about the safety of that person around
 
05:17:53.878 --> 05:17:56.390 align:start position:0%
about the safety of that person around
children

05:17:56.390 --> 05:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
children
 
05:17:58.730 --> 05:17:58.740 align:start position:0%
we don't want to take that person out of
 
05:18:01.430 --> 05:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
the public school realm and say
 
05:18:04.070 --> 05:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
well you can go to to a non-public
 
05:18:06.170 --> 05:18:06.180 align:start position:0%
school and teach there
 
05:18:06.180 --> 05:18:06.890 align:start position:0%
school and teach there
um

05:18:06.890 --> 05:18:06.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:09.708 --> 05:18:09.718 align:start position:0%
you know I rarely testify in my personal
 
05:18:12.350 --> 05:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
capacity you you all know I rarely say
 
05:18:14.390 --> 05:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
the word I I refer to the department but
 
05:18:16.670 --> 05:18:16.680 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that I personally would
 
05:18:18.230 --> 05:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
not feel comfortable if there was an
 
05:18:21.288 --> 05:18:21.298 align:start position:0%
educator that I believed was potentially
 
05:18:23.570 --> 05:18:23.580 align:start position:0%
dangerous around a child saying yeah go
 
05:18:25.910 --> 05:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
teach in a non-public even saying that I
 
05:18:27.590 --> 05:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
have chills down my spine I would not
 
05:18:29.510 --> 05:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable doing that I know from
 
05:18:31.490 --> 05:18:31.500 align:start position:0%
the Department's perspective
 
05:18:33.610 --> 05:18:33.620 align:start position:0%
we have limited oversight of dawn Publix
 
05:18:36.948 --> 05:18:36.958 align:start position:0%
but as a state agency
 
05:18:39.530 --> 05:18:39.540 align:start position:0%
ethically we would have concerns with
 
05:18:41.990 --> 05:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
that I share with this committee the
 
05:18:43.788 --> 05:18:43.798 align:start position:0%
story that I believe I testified to
 
05:18:47.810 --> 05:18:47.820 align:start position:0%
Prior which was an educator in a public
 
05:18:49.250 --> 05:18:49.260 align:start position:0%
school here in New Hampshire in the
 
05:18:51.110 --> 05:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
western part of the state
 
05:18:54.770 --> 05:18:54.780 align:start position:0%
um was was removed from his job the
 
05:18:56.448 --> 05:18:56.458 align:start position:0%
superintendent called me was removed
 
05:18:58.310 --> 05:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
from his job because he wrote A Love
 
05:19:00.410 --> 05:19:00.420 align:start position:0%
Song to a 13 year old child
 
05:19:02.690 --> 05:19:02.700 align:start position:0%
that is not illegal that is not criminal
 
05:19:04.010 --> 05:19:04.020 align:start position:0%
you're not going to find that on a
 
05:19:05.750 --> 05:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
criminal background check the
 
05:19:07.970 --> 05:19:07.980 align:start position:0%
superintendent terminated him
 
05:19:09.830 --> 05:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
slash he resigned one of those
 
05:19:12.530 --> 05:19:12.540 align:start position:0%
employment mechanisms
 
05:19:14.868 --> 05:19:14.878 align:start position:0%
and left that District he is no longer
 
05:19:16.310 --> 05:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
with that District he will never go back
 
05:19:18.230 --> 05:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
to that District
 
05:19:19.368 --> 05:19:19.378 align:start position:0%
and I was working with the
 
05:19:22.310 --> 05:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
superintendent and I simply said to the
 
05:19:24.230 --> 05:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
superintendent you did everything in
 
05:19:25.368 --> 05:19:25.378 align:start position:0%
your power and control you did
 
05:19:27.530 --> 05:19:27.540 align:start position:0%
everything right he is no longer at your
 
05:19:29.090 --> 05:19:29.100 align:start position:0%
District I have one question for you
 
05:19:31.910 --> 05:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
what about all the other kids
 
05:19:34.128 --> 05:19:34.138 align:start position:0%
and she said got it I'll work with you
 
05:19:36.830 --> 05:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
and she worked with us and we have him
 
05:19:39.530 --> 05:19:39.540 align:start position:0%
on our suspended list which is public it
 
05:19:42.110 --> 05:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
is on our website and there's a brief
 
05:19:44.628 --> 05:19:44.638 align:start position:0%
description about why he's on our our
 
05:19:44.638 --> 05:19:45.770 align:start position:0%
description about why he's on our our
list

05:19:45.770 --> 05:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
list
 
05:19:48.708 --> 05:19:48.718 align:start position:0%
um you can access that list
 
05:19:50.930 --> 05:19:50.940 align:start position:0%
um and and that's the type of behavior
 
05:19:52.850 --> 05:19:52.860 align:start position:0%
we want to prevent from going to another
 
05:19:54.590 --> 05:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
District I'm not comfortable but that
 
05:19:56.750 --> 05:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
individual was in that District in the
 
05:19:58.250 --> 05:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
western part of the state and I don't
 
05:20:01.670 --> 05:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
want it in the other parts of the state
 
05:20:03.350 --> 05:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
and I wouldn't want it at a non-public
 
05:20:03.360 --> 05:20:05.150 align:start position:0%
and I wouldn't want it at a non-public
either

05:20:05.150 --> 05:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
either
 
05:20:08.990 --> 05:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
further comments or questions to
 
05:20:11.330 --> 05:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:20:14.390 --> 05:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
or was somebody oh represent Tanner just
 
05:20:16.310 --> 05:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
first of all apologize for breaking in
 
05:20:20.030 --> 05:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
on different things but I am so involved
 
05:20:23.690 --> 05:20:23.700 align:start position:0%
in the the safety issue we know that
 
05:20:27.288 --> 05:20:27.298 align:start position:0%
um and and this bill above all other
 
05:20:29.330 --> 05:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
bills is really one of the more
 
05:20:31.730 --> 05:20:31.740 align:start position:0%
important ones this year and I think it
 
05:20:34.310 --> 05:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
speaks to not only working at a private
 
05:20:37.070 --> 05:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
school but also as a volunteer and you
 
05:20:37.080 --> 05:20:37.850 align:start position:0%
school but also as a volunteer and you
know

05:20:37.850 --> 05:20:37.860 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:20:40.788 --> 05:20:40.798 align:start position:0%
um these people that uh are in this
 
05:20:42.770 --> 05:20:42.780 align:start position:0%
category sometimes like to slip between
 
05:20:44.868 --> 05:20:44.878 align:start position:0%
the cracks and this stuff closes one of
 
05:20:47.810 --> 05:20:47.820 align:start position:0%
those cracks and at the same time
 
05:20:47.820 --> 05:20:48.470 align:start position:0%
those cracks and at the same time
um

05:20:48.470 --> 05:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:50.868 --> 05:20:50.878 align:start position:0%
that it's unfortunate that those those
 
05:20:53.690 --> 05:20:53.700 align:start position:0%
people exist and and have have gone
 
05:20:55.190 --> 05:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
through this process but at the same
 
05:20:57.830 --> 05:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
time we do not bismirch the whole
 
05:21:01.010 --> 05:21:01.020 align:start position:0%
profession of teaching or teachers or
 
05:21:03.530 --> 05:21:03.540 align:start position:0%
make comments that are not appropriate
 
05:21:06.530 --> 05:21:06.540 align:start position:0%

I've said this before
 
05:21:22.788 --> 05:21:22.798 align:start position:0%
this document the code of conduct is
 
05:21:25.850 --> 05:21:25.860 align:start position:0%
stronger the less we use it as an agency
 
05:21:27.590 --> 05:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
it really is it really should be
 
05:21:30.128 --> 05:21:30.138 align:start position:0%
reserved for those very small
 
05:21:33.050 --> 05:21:33.060 align:start position:0%
very small percentage of individuals who
 
05:21:34.430 --> 05:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
are who are dangerous around children
 
05:21:36.530 --> 05:21:36.540 align:start position:0%
and I say that my mom was a New

highly of Educators and um this
 
05:21:42.948 --> 05:21:42.958 align:start position:0%

05:28:13.310 --> 05:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
and then on the amending language which
 
05:28:16.850 --> 05:28:16.860 align:start position:0%
we discussed last week or wherever the
 
05:28:19.310 --> 05:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
last time we met there was an added
 
05:28:23.750 --> 05:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
section to 189 colon 66 under Roman 5
 
05:28:27.230 --> 05:28:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:29.990 --> 05:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
and it reads A provision that students
 
05:28:32.208 --> 05:28:32.218 align:start position:0%

05:28:34.070 --> 05:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
Career Technical education May with
 
05:28:36.890 --> 05:28:36.900 align:start position:0%
written parental consent register for
 
05:28:39.170 --> 05:28:39.180 align:start position:0%
technology platforms and services to be
 
05:28:41.090 --> 05:28:41.100 align:start position:0%
used as part of the student's approved
 
05:28:43.430 --> 05:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
program of study which required the
 
05:28:44.930 --> 05:28:44.940 align:start position:0%
provision of personally identifiable
 
05:28:47.810 --> 05:28:47.820 align:start position:0%
information copies of a written of
 
05:28:49.610 --> 05:28:49.620 align:start position:0%
written parental consent shall be
 
05:28:50.990 --> 05:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
retained as part of the students
 
05:28:54.530 --> 05:28:54.540 align:start position:0%
educational record that is what we had
 
05:28:56.628 --> 05:28:56.638 align:start position:0%
quite a discussion on that portion of it
 
05:28:59.208 --> 05:28:59.218 align:start position:0%
is there any anybody that doesn't
 
05:29:01.128 --> 05:29:01.138 align:start position:0%
remember or recall that other than those
 
05:29:04.610 --> 05:29:04.620 align:start position:0%
like represents that representatives to
 
05:29:06.708 --> 05:29:06.718 align:start position:0%
stand the end yes representative Hall uh
 
05:29:07.850 --> 05:29:07.860 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
05:29:09.708 --> 05:29:09.718 align:start position:0%
um the other thing I remember is adding
 
05:29:11.810 --> 05:29:11.820 align:start position:0%
the word approved for before technology
 
05:29:13.850 --> 05:29:13.860 align:start position:0%
platforms we had talked about that there
 
05:29:15.590 --> 05:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
was talk about that having approved in
 
05:29:18.170 --> 05:29:18.180 align:start position:0%
their choice I agree okay it would be
 
05:29:20.208 --> 05:29:20.218 align:start position:0%
read registered for Approved technology
 
05:29:22.368 --> 05:29:22.378 align:start position:0%
platforms and then students approves
 
05:29:25.610 --> 05:29:25.620 align:start position:0%
program of study I recall that too in
 
05:29:29.208 --> 05:29:29.218 align:start position:0%
fact I wrote that on one and uh
 
05:29:31.128 --> 05:29:31.138 align:start position:0%
yeah on that one right there
 
05:29:33.830 --> 05:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
so now the other section which we had
 
05:29:36.830 --> 05:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
was a section which was an amendment by
 
05:29:38.830 --> 05:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
brought forward by represent McDonald
 
05:29:44.030 --> 05:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
and dealing with concerns for safety of
 
05:29:46.250 --> 05:29:46.260 align:start position:0%
the students
 
05:29:46.260 --> 05:29:48.170 align:start position:0%
the students
and

05:29:48.170 --> 05:29:48.180 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:29:50.930 --> 05:29:50.940 align:start position:0%
you gotta get back to that one the can
 
05:29:50.940 --> 05:29:55.670 align:start position:0%
you gotta get back to that one the can
here

05:29:55.670 --> 05:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:55.680 --> 05:30:10.190 align:start position:0%
 
oh

05:30:10.190 --> 05:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:12.890 --> 05:30:12.900 align:start position:0%
I think that was uh it was in that other
 
05:30:17.090 --> 05:30:17.100 align:start position:0%
amendment I believe it was at 1269 h
 
05:30:19.670 --> 05:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
McDonald Amendment
 
05:30:19.680 --> 05:30:28.850 align:start position:0%
McDonald Amendment
yeah

05:30:28.850 --> 05:30:28.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:30.890 --> 05:30:30.900 align:start position:0%
and that read something to the fact that
 
05:30:32.930 --> 05:30:32.940 align:start position:0%
nothing in this section shall encourage
 
05:30:34.670 --> 05:30:34.680 align:start position:0%
student involvement in careers as
 
05:30:37.788 --> 05:30:37.798 align:start position:0%
influencers social media models or
 
05:30:40.190 --> 05:30:40.200 align:start position:0%
Internet personalities or which
 
05:30:42.410 --> 05:30:42.420 align:start position:0%
otherwise diminish student safety is
 
05:30:44.570 --> 05:30:44.580 align:start position:0%
that correct Valerie
 
05:30:44.580 --> 05:30:46.310 align:start position:0%
that correct Valerie
okay

05:30:46.310 --> 05:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:30:50.150 --> 05:30:50.160 align:start position:0%
so let's open it up to those three areas
 
05:30:54.050 --> 05:30:54.060 align:start position:0%
right now and see if there's any concern
 
05:30:56.690 --> 05:30:56.700 align:start position:0%
um why I'm doing it this way if we're
 
05:30:58.310 --> 05:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
going to do anything with this bill and
 
05:31:00.170 --> 05:31:00.180 align:start position:0%
moving it forward it's got to be done
 
05:31:00.180 --> 05:31:01.250 align:start position:0%
moving it forward it's got to be done
today

05:31:01.250 --> 05:31:01.260 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:31:03.708 --> 05:31:03.718 align:start position:0%
we're running out of time
 
05:31:07.310 --> 05:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
and if if it's necessary to get you know
 
05:31:09.410 --> 05:31:09.420 align:start position:0%
an amendment would approved in it that
 
05:31:11.750 --> 05:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that could be done but we have
 
05:31:13.128 --> 05:31:13.138 align:start position:0%
to start thinking about doing that in
 
05:31:15.170 --> 05:31:15.180 align:start position:0%
the next five minutes or so
 
05:31:17.390 --> 05:31:17.400 align:start position:0%
because they can take up to an hour to
 
05:31:18.590 --> 05:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
do this
 
05:31:21.470 --> 05:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
or the other option is to retain this
 
05:31:21.480 --> 05:31:22.490 align:start position:0%
or the other option is to retain this
bill

05:31:22.490 --> 05:31:22.500 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:31:25.010 --> 05:31:25.020 align:start position:0%
and we've got 20 already retained I'm
 
05:31:26.690 --> 05:31:26.700 align:start position:0%
not inclined to want to do that again
 
05:31:28.610 --> 05:31:28.620 align:start position:0%
for another bill
 
05:31:31.430 --> 05:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
so let's have some quick discussion here
 
05:31:32.990 --> 05:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
represent luno
 
05:31:34.788 --> 05:31:34.798 align:start position:0%
so thank you Mr chair I think it's
 
05:31:36.770 --> 05:31:36.780 align:start position:0%
important that we move this bill forward
 
05:31:39.110 --> 05:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
today and I think it's important for all
 
05:31:41.990 --> 05:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
the reasons that Jeff beard laid out but
 
05:31:44.930 --> 05:31:44.940 align:start position:0%
also clearly for students who um who go
 
05:31:48.650 --> 05:31:48.660 align:start position:0%
to CTE students and
 
05:31:51.770 --> 05:31:51.780 align:start position:0%
um and can can receive digital
 
05:31:53.650 --> 05:31:53.660 align:start position:0%
credentials through
 
05:31:58.010 --> 05:31:58.020 align:start position:0%
platforms like like LinkedIn you know I
 
05:32:01.868 --> 05:32:01.878 align:start position:0%
I think the amendment that that
 
05:32:06.530 --> 05:32:06.540 align:start position:0%
chair Ladd has put forward 2007 H is
 
05:32:10.250 --> 05:32:10.260 align:start position:0%
good except I don't support the um the
 
05:32:13.250 --> 05:32:13.260 align:start position:0%
the sentence that begins nothing in this
 
05:32:15.890 --> 05:32:15.900 align:start position:0%
section shall encourage that begins on
 
05:32:18.170 --> 05:32:18.180 align:start position:0%
the end of line nine it completes
 
05:32:20.270 --> 05:32:20.280 align:start position:0%
through line 11.
 
05:32:24.050 --> 05:32:24.060 align:start position:0%
um I don't think it's necessary and um
 
05:32:26.628 --> 05:32:26.638 align:start position:0%
and it's you know it's one of those
 
05:32:28.250 --> 05:32:28.260 align:start position:0%
things what other things do we want to
 
05:32:30.230 --> 05:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
knock out or prevent I mean it's
 
05:32:32.330 --> 05:32:32.340 align:start position:0%
essentially an unlimited list why are we
 
05:32:34.610 --> 05:32:34.620 align:start position:0%
limiting it to these and when you start
 
05:32:37.730 --> 05:32:37.740 align:start position:0%
having a knockout list that limits it to
 
05:32:39.410 --> 05:32:39.420 align:start position:0%
three things is that saying that
 
05:32:42.470 --> 05:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
anything that's not on this list is is
 
05:32:46.250 --> 05:32:46.260 align:start position:0%
therefore uh acceptable or encouraged so
 
05:32:49.010 --> 05:32:49.020 align:start position:0%
I I would think we're better off uh
 
05:32:52.250 --> 05:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
leaving it to the Judgment of the local
 
05:32:54.530 --> 05:32:54.540 align:start position:0%
school boards uh and their approval
 
05:32:56.930 --> 05:32:56.940 align:start position:0%
curriculum as to whether or not they
 
05:32:59.208 --> 05:32:59.218 align:start position:0%
want to have careers and influencers
 
05:33:00.530 --> 05:33:00.540 align:start position:0%
social media models internet
 
05:33:03.850 --> 05:33:03.860 align:start position:0%
personalities it just seems um
 
05:33:06.890 --> 05:33:06.900 align:start position:0%
that it would not be necessary in this
 
05:33:06.900 --> 05:33:09.230 align:start position:0%
that it would not be necessary in this
uh

05:33:09.230 --> 05:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:33:11.690 --> 05:33:11.700 align:start position:0%
in this amendment so I would suggest
 
05:33:12.770 --> 05:33:12.780 align:start position:0%
just eliminating that line
 
05:33:14.570 --> 05:33:14.580 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald thank you Mr
 
05:33:16.190 --> 05:33:16.200 align:start position:0%
chair I'd like to respond to that a
 
05:33:17.750 --> 05:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
little bit considering I wrote that
 
05:33:20.570 --> 05:33:20.580 align:start position:0%
sentence the list is non-exhaustive
 
05:33:22.850 --> 05:33:22.860 align:start position:0%
because of the last clause which says or
 
05:33:24.350 --> 05:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
which otherwise diminished student
 
05:33:26.930 --> 05:33:26.940 align:start position:0%
safety to respond to what you just said
 
05:33:28.910 --> 05:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
just because something's not listed does
 
05:33:30.410 --> 05:33:30.420 align:start position:0%
not mean it's encouraged because again
 
05:33:33.230 --> 05:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
it says or which otherwise diminishes
 
05:33:35.628 --> 05:33:35.638 align:start position:0%
student safety again this goes with the
 
05:33:37.368 --> 05:33:37.378 align:start position:0%
comments of Representative Tanner on the
 
05:33:39.288 --> 05:33:39.298 align:start position:0%
last bill just a few minutes ago safety
 
05:33:40.670 --> 05:33:40.680 align:start position:0%
is Paramount and that's what this
 
05:33:40.680 --> 05:33:42.530 align:start position:0%
is Paramount and that's what this
sentence

05:33:42.530 --> 05:33:42.540 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
05:33:42.540 --> 05:33:44.208 align:start position:0%
sentence
um demonstrates

05:33:44.208 --> 05:33:44.218 align:start position:0%
um demonstrates
 
05:33:46.670 --> 05:33:46.680 align:start position:0%
no no I'm I'm sorry you misinterpreted
 
05:33:48.350 --> 05:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
what I what I said
 
05:33:50.448 --> 05:33:50.458 align:start position:0%
um I didn't say that this that this
 
05:33:54.050 --> 05:33:54.060 align:start position:0%
sentence is is exhaustive
 
05:33:57.890 --> 05:33:57.900 align:start position:0%
um uh it's it it it's not when you when
 
05:34:00.590 --> 05:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
you start saying this you can't do this
 
05:34:02.208 --> 05:34:02.218 align:start position:0%
or you can't do this or you can't do
 
05:34:03.890 --> 05:34:03.900 align:start position:0%
that what's that saying about other
 
05:34:06.470 --> 05:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
things that you do not list
 
05:34:08.750 --> 05:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
um uh in this so so
 
05:34:11.690 --> 05:34:11.700 align:start position:0%
um I I just don't feel it's that
 
05:34:15.110 --> 05:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:15.120 --> 05:34:18.288 align:start position:0%
 
Alexis

05:34:18.288 --> 05:34:18.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:22.310 --> 05:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
yes I object to uh this the sentence in
 
05:34:25.128 --> 05:34:25.138 align:start position:0%
Part B this definition shall not apply
 
05:34:26.690 --> 05:34:26.700 align:start position:0%
to platforms used for demonstrating
 
05:34:28.550 --> 05:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
evidence in student Career Development
 
05:34:30.830 --> 05:34:30.840 align:start position:0%
because one of the things that that
 
05:34:35.868 --> 05:34:35.878 align:start position:0%
would then allow is LinkedIn and I got a
 
05:34:38.090 --> 05:34:38.100 align:start position:0%
call from
 
05:34:40.970 --> 05:34:40.980 align:start position:0%
rep Ford's wife Mary Ford who works and
 
05:34:43.810 --> 05:34:43.820 align:start position:0%
has worked with uh
 
05:34:46.788 --> 05:34:46.798 align:start position:0%
Granite State and I think she's
 
05:34:49.368 --> 05:34:49.378 align:start position:0%
currently with snow she's done a lot of
 
05:34:52.550 --> 05:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
work in these areas and she called me
 
05:34:54.590 --> 05:34:54.600 align:start position:0%
because she was very concerned that we
 
05:34:56.810 --> 05:34:56.820 align:start position:0%
would be allowing LinkedIn to high
 
05:34:58.850 --> 05:34:58.860 align:start position:0%
schools they do not do it in her college
 
05:35:01.610 --> 05:35:01.620 align:start position:0%
and they do not do it because she said
 
05:35:03.948 --> 05:35:03.958 align:start position:0%
they are very loose with their private
 
05:35:06.650 --> 05:35:06.660 align:start position:0%
data they you know they are not good at
 
05:35:09.470 --> 05:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
holding on to private data she suggested
 
05:35:12.050 --> 05:35:12.060 align:start position:0%
and what they do at the University that
 
05:35:15.770 --> 05:35:15.780 align:start position:0%
she is at is they have a private
 
05:35:15.780 --> 05:35:16.730 align:start position:0%
she is at is they have a private
um

05:35:16.730 --> 05:35:16.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:18.708 --> 05:35:18.718 align:start position:0%
I forget what she called it it's a
 
05:35:20.628 --> 05:35:20.638 align:start position:0%
private organization that takes that
 
05:35:24.010 --> 05:35:24.020 align:start position:0%
keeps track of all the various
 
05:35:27.650 --> 05:35:27.660 align:start position:0%
Badges and accreditations and all that
 
05:35:28.610 --> 05:35:28.620 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
05:35:28.620 --> 05:35:30.770 align:start position:0%
kind of
digital

05:35:30.770 --> 05:35:30.780 align:start position:0%
digital
 
05:35:32.570 --> 05:35:32.580 align:start position:0%
um and she said there are a number of
 
05:35:36.350 --> 05:35:36.360 align:start position:0%
them out there and they are they are
 
05:35:38.390 --> 05:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
very good and very tight with with
 
05:35:41.150 --> 05:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
holding on to the students data and not
 
05:35:44.330 --> 05:35:44.340 align:start position:0%
letting it you know their private data
 
05:35:48.470 --> 05:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
and so that was her big concern and this
 
05:35:51.410 --> 05:35:51.420 align:start position:0%
is what they do I mean she's they do
 
05:35:54.590 --> 05:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
this and that that is the policy of her
 
05:35:56.868 --> 05:35:56.878 align:start position:0%
University and her and of the students
 
05:35:58.850 --> 05:35:58.860 align:start position:0%
there is they don't do LinkedIn they do
 
05:36:01.730 --> 05:36:01.740 align:start position:0%
not recommend LinkedIn because LinkedIn
 
05:36:04.550 --> 05:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
is not secure and that they are much
 
05:36:06.948 --> 05:36:06.958 align:start position:0%
more secure platforms that are not
 
05:36:10.030 --> 05:36:10.040 align:start position:0%
social media and so her concern was
 
05:36:13.490 --> 05:36:13.500 align:start position:0%
allowing social media I mean allowing
 
05:36:18.590 --> 05:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:20.270 --> 05:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
she's talking in regard to the
 
05:36:22.730 --> 05:36:22.740 align:start position:0%
university system or that level she's
 
05:36:25.010 --> 05:36:25.020 align:start position:0%
not talking to high school she's talking
 
05:36:28.430 --> 05:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
about University but the situation is
 
05:36:30.230 --> 05:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
the same whether it's University
 
05:36:32.628 --> 05:36:32.638 align:start position:0%
students private data or high school
 
05:36:34.430 --> 05:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
students private data and I would say it
 
05:36:36.350 --> 05:36:36.360 align:start position:0%
was even worse for high school students
 
05:36:38.570 --> 05:36:38.580 align:start position:0%
because they're not even
 
05:36:41.448 --> 05:36:41.458 align:start position:0%
adults yet
 
05:36:46.430 --> 05:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:48.708 --> 05:36:48.718 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent Belcher
 
05:36:50.510 --> 05:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair just to follow up a
 
05:36:51.830 --> 05:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
little bit on that too we we heard
 
05:36:54.288 --> 05:36:54.298 align:start position:0%
expert testimony and subcommittee we
 
05:36:55.670 --> 05:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
heard that there is reason to be
 
05:36:57.288 --> 05:36:57.298 align:start position:0%
concerned about Predator sliding into
 
05:37:01.250 --> 05:37:01.260 align:start position:0%
direct messages in student social media
 
05:37:02.810 --> 05:37:02.820 align:start position:0%
um we heard that there is reason to be
 
05:37:05.208 --> 05:37:05.218 align:start position:0%
concerned about data and security
 
05:37:07.850 --> 05:37:07.860 align:start position:0%
but the biggest concern I had was that
 
05:37:10.128 --> 05:37:10.138 align:start position:0%
yes this would in fact Place students
 
05:37:12.708 --> 05:37:12.718 align:start position:0%
under third party social media terms of
 
05:37:14.810 --> 05:37:14.820 align:start position:0%
service this would put them under their
 
05:37:17.690 --> 05:37:17.700 align:start position:0%
speech codes their Association codes and
 
05:37:19.970 --> 05:37:19.980 align:start position:0%
it just so happens that the LinkedIn
 
05:37:21.830 --> 05:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
platform because this is colloquial
 
05:37:24.230 --> 05:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
known as the LinkedIn Bill the LinkedIn
 
05:37:26.330 --> 05:37:26.340 align:start position:0%
platform just five days ago kicked
 
05:37:28.490 --> 05:37:28.500 align:start position:0%
presidential candidate Vivek ramaswamy
 
05:37:31.010 --> 05:37:31.020 align:start position:0%
off their platform for criticizing the
 
05:37:32.690 --> 05:37:32.700 align:start position:0%
Chinese Communist Party
 
05:37:35.868 --> 05:37:35.878 align:start position:0%
this is something that we have to take
 
05:37:37.910 --> 05:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
into consideration is what kind of
 
05:37:40.250 --> 05:37:40.260 align:start position:0%
speech codes will high school students
 
05:37:42.770 --> 05:37:42.780 align:start position:0%
now be subject to and we heard expert
 
05:37:44.770 --> 05:37:44.780 align:start position:0%
testimony to the effect that actually
 
05:37:47.628 --> 05:37:47.638 align:start position:0%
maybe teachers should be teaching
 
05:37:49.970 --> 05:37:49.980 align:start position:0%
students how to not say controversial
 
05:37:51.288 --> 05:37:51.298 align:start position:0%
things online
 
05:37:54.230 --> 05:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
that's totally goes against the concept
 
05:37:56.270 --> 05:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
of freedom of speech and I think that
 
05:37:58.730 --> 05:37:58.740 align:start position:0%
needs to be preserved above all else and
 
05:38:01.970 --> 05:38:01.980 align:start position:0%
that's why I think this unamended is one
 
05:38:03.410 --> 05:38:03.420 align:start position:0%
of the most dangerous things we could
 
05:38:05.208 --> 05:38:05.218 align:start position:0%
possibly be doing to students and I
 
05:38:06.650 --> 05:38:06.660 align:start position:0%
would be no one anything that doesn't
 
05:38:10.250 --> 05:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
explicitly remove the possibility of
 
05:38:11.868 --> 05:38:11.878 align:start position:0%
social media being brought into our
 
05:38:11.878 --> 05:38:14.750 align:start position:0%
social media being brought into our
schools

05:38:14.750 --> 05:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:16.368 --> 05:38:16.378 align:start position:0%
representative Hall
 
05:38:18.050 --> 05:38:18.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so on that
 
05:38:20.510 --> 05:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh we heard from Jeff beard
 
05:38:24.770 --> 05:38:24.780 align:start position:0%
uh Pam McLeod Jeff beard CTE and
 
05:38:28.910 --> 05:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
um Pam McLeod and her partner Josh or
 
05:38:31.430 --> 05:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
Justin or something anyway from the
 
05:38:32.930 --> 05:38:32.940 align:start position:0%
um Concord School District because she's
 
05:38:34.610 --> 05:38:34.620 align:start position:0%
on the Concord student school district
 
05:38:37.250 --> 05:38:37.260 align:start position:0%
and she's a data and security specialist
 
05:38:40.730 --> 05:38:40.740 align:start position:0%
and they agreed the two of them felt
 
05:38:42.650 --> 05:38:42.660 align:start position:0%
that the original bill
 
05:38:46.368 --> 05:38:46.378 align:start position:0%
was good that the security data part of
 
05:38:47.990 --> 05:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
it would should be worked on for about
 
05:38:51.050 --> 05:38:51.060 align:start position:0%
six months to get that all right so they
 
05:38:53.868 --> 05:38:53.878 align:start position:0%
were really both supportive of they said
 
05:38:55.788 --> 05:38:55.798 align:start position:0%
it made us stronger I think I also heard
 
05:38:57.050 --> 05:38:57.060 align:start position:0%
that they
 
05:39:00.050 --> 05:39:00.060 align:start position:0%
can use LinkedIn now but that it made it
 
05:39:02.330 --> 05:39:02.340 align:start position:0%
stronger the original one I have to say
 
05:39:04.310 --> 05:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
for myself when we
 
05:39:06.050 --> 05:39:06.060 align:start position:0%
um it was a language that you had
 
05:39:08.570 --> 05:39:08.580 align:start position:0%
presented chairman Ladd uh that was
 
05:39:10.990 --> 05:39:11.000 align:start position:0%
developed with attorney Fenton I think
 
05:39:14.030 --> 05:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
with the approved and the approved and
 
05:39:15.530 --> 05:39:15.540 align:start position:0%
that seemed to be
 
05:39:18.170 --> 05:39:18.180 align:start position:0%
fine to me I didn't have a problem with
 
05:39:20.090 --> 05:39:20.100 align:start position:0%
that but going back to the one right
 
05:39:21.490 --> 05:39:21.500 align:start position:0%
here on
 
05:39:25.128 --> 05:39:25.138 align:start position:0%
20078 I would not support that
 
05:39:27.948 --> 05:39:27.958 align:start position:0%
um I think that I would support what
 
05:39:30.110 --> 05:39:30.120 align:start position:0%
Jeff beard and Pam McLeod had
 
05:39:31.910 --> 05:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
recommended from the beginning is to go
 
05:39:34.190 --> 05:39:34.200 align:start position:0%
with the original language and not do
 
05:39:38.270 --> 05:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:40.970 --> 05:39:40.980 align:start position:0%
for the representative McDowell thank
 
05:39:42.948 --> 05:39:42.958 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair since it has been brought
 
05:39:46.550 --> 05:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
up in respect to the subcommittee they
 
05:39:49.910 --> 05:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
Jeff beard and um the other speaker as
 
05:39:51.910 --> 05:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
well they did say that they like the
 
05:39:56.448 --> 05:39:56.458 align:start position:0%
amendment as well that is 1269 age since
 
05:39:58.730 --> 05:39:58.740 align:start position:0%
members of the subcommittee address
 
05:40:01.610 --> 05:40:01.620 align:start position:0%
concerns being Predators online after
 
05:40:03.830 --> 05:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
looking at it for maybe 10 to 30 seconds
 
05:40:07.190 --> 05:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
said if we do have a concern as many
 
05:40:08.930 --> 05:40:08.940 align:start position:0%
committee members and subcommittee
 
05:40:11.330 --> 05:40:11.340 align:start position:0%
members Express of Online safety
 
05:40:15.050 --> 05:40:15.060 align:start position:0%
concerns due to Predators online harming
 
05:40:18.948 --> 05:40:18.958 align:start position:0%
students with social media accounts used
 
05:40:21.350 --> 05:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
in schools a concern that was addressed
 
05:40:24.288 --> 05:40:24.298 align:start position:0%
that Amendment 1269 age or similar
 
05:40:27.230 --> 05:40:27.240 align:start position:0%
language as presented by chairman Ladd
 
05:40:30.170 --> 05:40:30.180 align:start position:0%
in 2007 H would address that safety
 
05:40:34.628 --> 05:40:34.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:36.650 --> 05:40:36.660 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
05:40:40.368 --> 05:40:40.378 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you I I think that the
 
05:40:40.378 --> 05:40:41.708 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you I I think that the
basic

05:40:41.708 --> 05:40:41.718 align:start position:0%
basic
 
05:40:45.288 --> 05:40:45.298 align:start position:0%
divide we're hearing is that the
 
05:40:47.930 --> 05:40:47.940 align:start position:0%
original bill and the amendment that you
 
05:40:50.510 --> 05:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
just referenced representative McDonald
 
05:40:50.520 --> 05:40:51.550 align:start position:0%
just referenced representative McDonald
um

05:40:51.550 --> 05:40:51.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:53.868 --> 05:40:53.878 align:start position:0%
basically exempt
 
05:40:58.010 --> 05:40:58.020 align:start position:0%
uh platforms for career development from
 
05:41:01.250 --> 05:41:01.260 align:start position:0%
the social media statutes and social
 
05:41:04.070 --> 05:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
media account definitions
 
05:41:04.080 --> 05:41:04.910 align:start position:0%
media account definitions
um

05:41:04.910 --> 05:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:09.190 --> 05:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
and some have expressed concerns about
 
05:41:11.930 --> 05:41:11.940 align:start position:0%
social media in general
 
05:41:17.090 --> 05:41:17.100 align:start position:0%
so I think you know and I also um from
 
05:41:19.030 --> 05:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
the beginning expressed concerns about
 
05:41:21.890 --> 05:41:21.900 align:start position:0%
the whole subject of digital badging is
 
05:41:23.770 --> 05:41:23.780 align:start position:0%
and is um
 
05:41:27.350 --> 05:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
representative lakis mentioned is in use
 
05:41:29.770 --> 05:41:29.780 align:start position:0%
at the community college system
 
05:41:33.770 --> 05:41:33.780 align:start position:0%
I think there are issues with ownership
 
05:41:36.830 --> 05:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
of the data access and even with
 
05:41:39.410 --> 05:41:39.420 align:start position:0%
LinkedIn we heard that there was instant
 
05:41:41.990 --> 05:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
messaging and I think um we we heard
 
05:41:47.208 --> 05:41:47.218 align:start position:0%
from some on uh in-house testimony that
 
05:41:49.430 --> 05:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
there is instant messaging available in
 
05:41:52.510 --> 05:41:52.520 align:start position:0%
LinkedIn and could put
 
05:41:56.270 --> 05:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
students in instant messaging contact
 
05:41:56.280 --> 05:41:57.670 align:start position:0%
students in instant messaging contact
with

05:41:57.670 --> 05:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:42:01.550 --> 05:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
teachers but who knows who else within
 
05:42:03.948 --> 05:42:03.958 align:start position:0%
the LinkedIn system
 
05:42:05.868 --> 05:42:05.878 align:start position:0%
um which which might be a concern so
 
05:42:05.878 --> 05:42:07.128 align:start position:0%
um which which might be a concern so
they're

05:42:07.128 --> 05:42:07.138 align:start position:0%
they're
 
05:42:11.890 --> 05:42:11.900 align:start position:0%
um you know is there a privacy agreement
 
05:42:15.410 --> 05:42:15.420 align:start position:0%
required for the district to sign with
 
05:42:18.170 --> 05:42:18.180 align:start position:0%
LinkedIn or whoever the vendor is
 
05:42:21.288 --> 05:42:21.298 align:start position:0%
um uh I think there are many issues
 
05:42:25.090 --> 05:42:25.100 align:start position:0%
along those lines that need to be
 
05:42:27.650 --> 05:42:27.660 align:start position:0%
addressed before
 
05:42:30.948 --> 05:42:30.958 align:start position:0%
um I'm comfortable with this
 
05:42:33.530 --> 05:42:33.540 align:start position:0%
um and I know from my research with
 
05:42:35.930 --> 05:42:35.940 align:start position:0%
digital badging I already mentioned the
 
05:42:38.390 --> 05:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
ownership of the data but
 
05:42:40.610 --> 05:42:40.620 align:start position:0%
um in some of these digital badging
 
05:42:42.650 --> 05:42:42.660 align:start position:0%
systems and I'm not sure about LinkedIn
 
05:42:42.660 --> 05:42:44.208 align:start position:0%
systems and I'm not sure about LinkedIn
but

05:42:44.208 --> 05:42:44.218 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:42:47.030 --> 05:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
um who can see that data in some of
 
05:42:48.770 --> 05:42:48.780 align:start position:0%
these digital badging systems the
 
05:42:52.250 --> 05:42:52.260 align:start position:0%
student can't even see what credentials
 
05:42:55.310 --> 05:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
are being added so I think there are
 
05:42:57.050 --> 05:42:57.060 align:start position:0%
many issues
 
05:42:59.510 --> 05:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
um and I was I think representative Paul
 
05:43:02.510 --> 05:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that some of those aspects
 
05:43:04.670 --> 05:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
need to be studied for for months by
 
05:43:07.610 --> 05:43:07.620 align:start position:0%
people at the subcommittee when they
 
05:43:07.620 --> 05:43:08.770 align:start position:0%
people at the subcommittee when they
testified

05:43:08.770 --> 05:43:08.780 align:start position:0%
testified
 
05:43:11.750 --> 05:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
so I think they're I'm very
 
05:43:14.990 --> 05:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with this the way it
 
05:43:15.000 --> 05:43:16.430 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with this the way it
stands

05:43:16.430 --> 05:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
stands
 
05:43:18.470 --> 05:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
one of the things we need to consider
 
05:43:21.830 --> 05:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
though is in looking at 189 colon 66
 
05:43:24.288 --> 05:43:24.298 align:start position:0%
Roman 5.
 
05:43:27.110 --> 05:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
it states each local Education Agency
 
05:43:29.510 --> 05:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
I.E School Board
 
05:43:31.610 --> 05:43:31.620 align:start position:0%
shall develop a data and privacy
 
05:43:33.650 --> 05:43:33.660 align:start position:0%
governance plan which shall be presented
 
05:43:35.030 --> 05:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
to the school board for review and
 
05:43:38.750 --> 05:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
approval by June 30th 2019.
 
05:43:41.930 --> 05:43:41.940 align:start position:0%
then underneath that item C policies and
 
05:43:43.910 --> 05:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
procedures for access to data and
 
05:43:45.708 --> 05:43:45.718 align:start position:0%
protection of privacy for students and
 
05:43:48.350 --> 05:43:48.360 align:start position:0%
staff including acceptable use policy
 
05:43:50.390 --> 05:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
for applications digital tools and
 
05:43:53.150 --> 05:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
extensions we're also adding item fifth
 
05:43:56.510 --> 05:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
F on there too so it seems to me that
 
05:43:59.570 --> 05:43:59.580 align:start position:0%
there's got to be as in the letter that
 
05:44:02.150 --> 05:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
I have from Jeff beard here
 
05:44:05.510 --> 05:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
um this uh see it says section five is
 
05:44:07.310 --> 05:44:07.320 align:start position:0%
the provision that currently requires
 
05:44:09.708 --> 05:44:09.718 align:start position:0%
each Lea to develop a data and privacy
 
05:44:12.530 --> 05:44:12.540 align:start position:0%
governance plan
 
05:44:15.350 --> 05:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
does that plan now is it now a local
 
05:44:17.868 --> 05:44:17.878 align:start position:0%
responsibility to develop this process
 
05:44:20.990 --> 05:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
and therefore what we be doing is just
 
05:44:23.868 --> 05:44:23.878 align:start position:0%
adding a section F on
 
05:44:28.548 --> 05:44:28.558 align:start position:0%
allowing the ctes to be involved as long
 
05:44:33.110 --> 05:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
as there's parental consent and the the
 
05:44:36.410 --> 05:44:36.420 align:start position:0%
online platform and services relevant to
 
05:44:39.530 --> 05:44:39.540 align:start position:0%
the students approved program of study
 
05:44:42.830 --> 05:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
so it looks to me like the school has
 
05:44:46.070 --> 05:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
you know is overseeing this plan correct
 
05:44:48.890 --> 05:44:48.900 align:start position:0%
me if I'm mistaken
 
05:44:51.288 --> 05:44:51.298 align:start position:0%
it represent Milo yeah I think you're I
 
05:44:53.930 --> 05:44:53.940 align:start position:0%
think you're right uh Rick and I I want
 
05:44:57.830 --> 05:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
to go back to how this bill came to us
 
05:44:59.990 --> 05:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
this came to us from the Career and
 
05:45:02.570 --> 05:45:02.580 align:start position:0%
Technical people who wanted to provide
 
05:45:05.750 --> 05:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
greater opportunities for kids who can't
 
05:45:08.150 --> 05:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
get on because of the restrictions of
 
05:45:10.190 --> 05:45:10.200 align:start position:0%
the school right now and I
 
05:45:12.350 --> 05:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
and I'm going back to the original but
 
05:45:14.030 --> 05:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the original bill at this
 
05:45:17.330 --> 05:45:17.340 align:start position:0%
thing and it talks about uh Career
 
05:45:19.010 --> 05:45:19.020 align:start position:0%
Development it talks about technical
 
05:45:21.948 --> 05:45:21.958 align:start position:0%
education this is dealing with CTE kids
 
05:45:24.350 --> 05:45:24.360 align:start position:0%
it's not dealing with middle school or
 
05:45:26.810 --> 05:45:26.820 align:start position:0%
high school kids or perhaps high school
 
05:45:29.208 --> 05:45:29.218 align:start position:0%
kids uh older ones but
 
05:45:32.390 --> 05:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm concerned because they brought
 
05:45:35.150 --> 05:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
this to us so that they could expand the
 
05:45:37.730 --> 05:45:37.740 align:start position:0%
opportunities for kids in the CTE
 
05:45:39.830 --> 05:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
programs I mean that's that was my
 
05:45:41.448 --> 05:45:41.458 align:start position:0%
original understanding for this the
 
05:45:43.788 --> 05:45:43.798 align:start position:0%
original bill was one in that paragraph
 
05:45:46.150 --> 05:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
too referenced the wrong area of Statute
 
05:45:50.690 --> 05:45:50.700 align:start position:0%
is 189.70 rather than 189
 
05:45:50.700 --> 05:45:53.030 align:start position:0%
is 189.70 rather than 189
66

05:45:53.030 --> 05:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
66
 
05:45:55.548 --> 05:45:55.558 align:start position:0%
and so we corrected that we made that
 
05:45:58.430 --> 05:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
change so
 
05:46:01.788 --> 05:46:01.798 align:start position:0%
you know I support the way the bill came
 
05:46:04.310 --> 05:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
to us with the modification that on
 
05:46:07.670 --> 05:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
number two we put it in F is which is
 
05:46:09.890 --> 05:46:09.900 align:start position:0%
reflective of what we we got from the
 
05:46:11.990 --> 05:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
Department the question I think that we
 
05:46:15.048 --> 05:46:15.058 align:start position:0%
have in front of us is do we include the
 
05:46:16.850 --> 05:46:16.860 align:start position:0%
the sentence which is the McDonald
 
05:46:24.708 --> 05:46:24.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:27.170 --> 05:46:27.180 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair and Rick I think
 
05:46:29.208 --> 05:46:29.218 align:start position:0%
you've you've you've summed it up very
 
05:46:31.670 --> 05:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
well there uh you know I think it would
 
05:46:34.190 --> 05:46:34.200 align:start position:0%
make sense to see and I would support an
 
05:46:36.530 --> 05:46:36.540 align:start position:0%
amendment that simply replaces section
 
05:46:38.150 --> 05:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
two of the bill
 
05:46:41.090 --> 05:46:41.100 align:start position:0%
with section two as you have in your
 
05:46:41.100 --> 05:46:42.230 align:start position:0%
with section two as you have in your
Amendment

05:46:42.230 --> 05:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
05:46:44.150 --> 05:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
that would do exactly what you just said
 
05:46:46.910 --> 05:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
is that correct that's correct okay
 
05:46:50.628 --> 05:46:50.638 align:start position:0%
but what about the up in section one the
 
05:46:55.070 --> 05:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
that second sentence there following the
 
05:46:57.410 --> 05:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
Waters Amendment or the way it came in
 
05:46:58.970 --> 05:46:58.980 align:start position:0%
from the Senate the second sentence
 
05:47:01.430 --> 05:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
would be gone the first sentence that
 
05:47:03.350 --> 05:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
this definition shall not apply is
 
05:47:05.030 --> 05:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
already in the bill
 
05:47:07.670 --> 05:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
yeah so it's just replacing what what
 
05:47:10.368 --> 05:47:10.378 align:start position:0%
you just said is essentially replacing
 
05:47:13.070 --> 05:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
section two in the bill as it came to us
 
05:47:15.110 --> 05:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
with section two from your Amendment
 
05:47:15.120 --> 05:47:18.910 align:start position:0%
with section two from your Amendment
yeah

05:47:18.910 --> 05:47:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:21.890 --> 05:47:21.900 align:start position:0%
yes represent Belcher thank you Mr chair
 
05:47:23.628 --> 05:47:23.638 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to clarify the testimony
 
05:47:26.150 --> 05:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
that we received regarding the um
 
05:47:29.150 --> 05:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
privacy agreements we heard from the
 
05:47:31.910 --> 05:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
experts that LinkedIn being owned by the
 
05:47:35.628 --> 05:47:35.638 align:start position:0%
Microsoft Corporation refused to enter
 
05:47:37.368 --> 05:47:37.378 align:start position:0%
into an agreement
 
05:47:38.750 --> 05:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
um therefore the only thing that they
 
05:47:41.270 --> 05:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
could do to get on to LinkedIn is to
 
05:47:43.250 --> 05:47:43.260 align:start position:0%
agree to the standard user agreement
 
05:47:45.230 --> 05:47:45.240 align:start position:0%
which effectively seeds All rights to
 
05:47:49.010 --> 05:47:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:50.930 --> 05:47:50.940 align:start position:0%
okay what we need to decide real quickly
 
05:47:52.548 --> 05:47:52.558 align:start position:0%
here you know before we have any more
 
05:47:53.810 --> 05:47:53.820 align:start position:0%
discussion on this because we're running
 
05:47:56.470 --> 05:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:59.810 --> 05:47:59.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh in as far as F
 
05:48:03.230 --> 05:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
goes I know on the on the Fenton
 
05:48:05.990 --> 05:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
you're not a mandatory approved uh no I
 
05:48:08.330 --> 05:48:08.340 align:start position:0%
was going to say Jeff you had said at
 
05:48:10.490 --> 05:48:10.500 align:start position:0%
the Committee hearing the Jeff beard
 
05:48:13.548 --> 05:48:13.558 align:start position:0%
agreed with this correct he had written
 
05:48:15.770 --> 05:48:15.780 align:start position:0%
you an email or something we had to
 
05:48:17.270 --> 05:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
review it by the attorney from the
 
05:48:18.890 --> 05:48:18.900 align:start position:0%
Department of Education but didn't he
 
05:48:21.128 --> 05:48:21.138 align:start position:0%
also he was also here
 
05:48:24.708 --> 05:48:24.718 align:start position:0%
okay yeah thank you
 
05:48:27.650 --> 05:48:27.660 align:start position:0%
so the question Jennifer uh when are
 
05:48:29.090 --> 05:48:29.100 align:start position:0%
when's the last moment we can get
 
05:48:30.530 --> 05:48:30.540 align:start position:0%
something done through
 
05:48:30.540 --> 05:48:31.250 align:start position:0%
something done through
um

05:48:31.250 --> 05:48:31.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:34.368 --> 05:48:34.378 align:start position:0%
OLS today if we were to take a sentence
 
05:48:46.390 --> 05:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:49.128 --> 05:48:49.138 align:start position:0%
so Rick Ricky was the play section two
 
05:48:49.138 --> 05:48:50.690 align:start position:0%
so Rick Ricky was the play section two
right

05:48:50.690 --> 05:48:50.700 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:48:54.530 --> 05:48:54.540 align:start position:0%
well we've we've got that already if you
 
05:48:57.170 --> 05:48:57.180 align:start position:0%
look at the Latin Amendment it's all re
 
05:48:59.810 --> 05:48:59.820 align:start position:0%
it's already in there right which that
 
05:49:01.750 --> 05:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment but if you take that sentence
 
05:49:09.048 --> 05:49:09.058 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:12.048 --> 05:49:12.058 align:start position:0%
is that second sentence that uh deals
 
05:49:13.368 --> 05:49:13.378 align:start position:0%
with that's the
 
05:49:16.128 --> 05:49:16.138 align:start position:0%
McDonald Amendment
 
05:49:18.650 --> 05:49:18.660 align:start position:0%
you know the thing is that if if we want
 
05:49:21.410 --> 05:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
to get this thing going
 
05:49:23.628 --> 05:49:23.638 align:start position:0%
we could go and have this great
 
05:49:27.350 --> 05:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
discussion a committee a conference
 
05:49:30.670 --> 05:49:30.680 align:start position:0%
or on the house floor either way
 
05:49:33.170 --> 05:49:33.180 align:start position:0%
if we could get this done we need to get
 
05:49:35.288 --> 05:49:35.298 align:start position:0%
it done the way we want it I agree
 
05:49:38.570 --> 05:49:38.580 align:start position:0%
but what I'd like to find out are if we
 
05:49:40.368 --> 05:49:40.378 align:start position:0%
go ahead and have something done now do
 
05:49:43.430 --> 05:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:45.230 --> 05:49:45.240 align:start position:0%
okay let's do a straw boat right now
 
05:49:47.930 --> 05:49:47.940 align:start position:0%
those which would be supportive of an
 
05:49:50.208 --> 05:49:50.218 align:start position:0%
amendment uh if you look at the lab
 
05:49:52.730 --> 05:49:52.740 align:start position:0%
Amendment right now taking out
 
05:49:57.048 --> 05:49:57.058 align:start position:0%
line the last sentence there in line 9
 
05:49:59.448 --> 05:49:59.458 align:start position:0%
10 11.
 
05:49:59.458 --> 05:50:01.368 align:start position:0%
10 11.
and

05:50:01.368 --> 05:50:01.378 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:50:04.430 --> 05:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
we could if it's time providing we could
 
05:50:06.590 --> 05:50:06.600 align:start position:0%
work put the word approved in there but
 
05:50:10.368 --> 05:50:10.378 align:start position:0%
I think that that's it's kind of the
 
05:50:11.810 --> 05:50:11.820 align:start position:0%
quickest way to do it is just take the
 
05:50:14.750 --> 05:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
one sentence out and have it like that
 
05:50:17.090 --> 05:50:17.100 align:start position:0%
so how many people would be supportive
 
05:50:21.350 --> 05:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:23.868 --> 05:50:23.878 align:start position:0%
I mean Mike can you count from I can't
 
05:50:26.948 --> 05:50:26.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:30.230 --> 05:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
yeah but you see how many I can't attend
 
05:50:33.548 --> 05:50:33.558 align:start position:0%
oh I'm with you no it's 10 I think
 
05:50:36.590 --> 05:50:36.600 align:start position:0%
one two three four
 
05:50:40.610 --> 05:50:40.620 align:start position:0%
five six seven eight nine ten eleven
 
05:50:43.910 --> 05:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
twelve thirteen so it's worth getting an
 
05:50:45.830 --> 05:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
amendment done
 
05:50:45.840 --> 05:50:53.170 align:start position:0%
amendment done
okay

05:50:53.170 --> 05:50:53.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:56.510 --> 05:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
for talking about
 
05:51:29.708 --> 05:51:29.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:35.390 --> 05:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:38.090 --> 05:51:38.100 align:start position:0%
okay but she now based on what happened
 
05:51:38.100 --> 05:51:55.150 align:start position:0%
okay but she now based on what happened
yesterday

05:51:55.150 --> 05:51:55.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:55.160 --> 05:52:05.230 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:52:05.230 --> 05:52:05.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:08.690 --> 05:52:08.700 align:start position:0%
they put in a two between two articles
 
05:52:13.128 --> 05:52:13.138 align:start position:0%
because it's basically missing a chamber
 
05:52:16.490 --> 05:52:16.500 align:start position:0%
um and Target would be another heart
 
05:52:24.650 --> 05:52:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:27.288 --> 05:52:27.298 align:start position:0%
and she's you know okay she's basically
 
05:52:41.990 --> 05:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:42.000 --> 05:53:51.890 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:53:51.890 --> 05:53:51.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:51.900 --> 05:54:26.448 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:54:26.448 --> 05:54:26.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:58.730 --> 05:54:58.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:58.740 --> 05:55:01.970 align:start position:0%
 
scheduled

05:55:01.970 --> 05:55:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:04.128 --> 05:55:04.138 align:start position:0%
we should have it in about 20 30 minutes
 
05:55:04.138 --> 05:55:07.070 align:start position:0%
we should have it in about 20 30 minutes
oh

05:55:07.070 --> 05:55:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:07.080 --> 05:55:27.010 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:55:27.010 --> 05:55:27.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:43.030 --> 05:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:45.170 --> 05:55:45.180 align:start position:0%
okay what we're going to do is we're
 
05:55:47.810 --> 05:55:47.820 align:start position:0%
going to just uh hold this in advance
 
05:55:50.510 --> 05:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
right now and we'll come back to it in
 
05:55:52.548 --> 05:55:52.558 align:start position:0%
about 20-25 minutes
 
05:55:55.070 --> 05:55:55.080 align:start position:0%
and we have an amendment
 
05:55:56.990 --> 05:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
so then that takes us through what we're
 
05:55:59.030 --> 05:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
going to exec today what I'd like to do
 
05:56:02.390 --> 05:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
is uh we had the 20 bills right there
 
05:56:03.948 --> 05:56:03.958 align:start position:0%
I'd like to quickly go down through that
 
05:56:07.670 --> 05:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
list and uh see which bills we can
 
05:56:09.530 --> 05:56:09.540 align:start position:0%
handle as a committee a whole which we
 
05:56:32.230 --> 05:56:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:34.910 --> 05:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
does everybody have a list of retained
 
05:56:36.410 --> 05:56:36.420 align:start position:0%
bills and while you should have it on
 
05:56:43.490 --> 05:56:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:46.010 --> 05:56:46.020 align:start position:0%
it is a copy I've got an extra one right
 
05:56:49.190 --> 05:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
here that's a copy of the calendar
 
05:56:52.610 --> 05:56:52.620 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah just you can see them on the
 
05:56:55.250 --> 05:56:55.260 align:start position:0%
bottom part there on that page
 
05:56:57.830 --> 05:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
okay the first bill which we have there
 
05:56:57.840 --> 05:56:58.970 align:start position:0%
okay the first bill which we have there
is

05:56:58.970 --> 05:56:58.980 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:57:01.910 --> 05:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
um we're looking at house bills here uh
 
05:57:05.830 --> 05:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
HB 147 advisory committee disabilities
 
05:57:09.410 --> 05:57:09.420 align:start position:0%
this deals with membership
 
05:57:11.690 --> 05:57:11.700 align:start position:0%
um is that something we can address uh
 
05:57:14.448 --> 05:57:14.458 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli uh you were
 
05:57:16.850 --> 05:57:16.860 align:start position:0%
weren't you part of that yes I think
 
05:57:19.368 --> 05:57:19.378 align:start position:0%
that was my bill
 
05:57:21.288 --> 05:57:21.298 align:start position:0%
um and it was basically to revised
 
05:57:21.298 --> 05:57:22.250 align:start position:0%
um and it was basically to revised
membership

05:57:22.250 --> 05:57:22.260 align:start position:0%
membership
 
05:57:25.128 --> 05:57:25.138 align:start position:0%
um the committee I think is uh unwieldy
 
05:57:28.310 --> 05:57:28.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of the number of participants
 
05:57:31.970 --> 05:57:31.980 align:start position:0%
um I've uh also talked to the former
 
05:57:31.980 --> 05:57:33.430 align:start position:0%
um I've uh also talked to the former
house

05:57:33.430 --> 05:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
house
 
05:57:35.750 --> 05:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
representative to
 
05:57:38.208 --> 05:57:38.218 align:start position:0%
um the committee and I talked to the
 
05:57:39.948 --> 05:57:39.958 align:start position:0%
current representative of Representative
 
05:57:44.090 --> 05:57:44.100 align:start position:0%
good job who agrees and shared her
 
05:57:47.090 --> 05:57:47.100 align:start position:0%
insights as to her experience
 
05:57:50.510 --> 05:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
um this year working on the committee
 
05:57:53.330 --> 05:57:53.340 align:start position:0%
and so I think the two of us agreed that
 
05:57:55.270 --> 05:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
we would get together and and review
 
05:57:58.970 --> 05:57:58.980 align:start position:0%
current membership as well as Federal
 
05:58:01.070 --> 05:58:01.080 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulations as to who is
 
05:58:04.548 --> 05:58:04.558 align:start position:0%
required to be members on this committee
 
05:58:07.788 --> 05:58:07.798 align:start position:0%
because that is in statute federally in
 
05:58:11.150 --> 05:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
under idea so I believe that we can take
 
05:58:13.070 --> 05:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
a look at that and bring something back
 
05:58:15.170 --> 05:58:15.180 align:start position:0%
in the fall to the community the whole
 
05:58:15.180 --> 05:58:17.090 align:start position:0%
in the fall to the community the whole
yes

05:58:17.090 --> 05:58:17.100 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:58:19.310 --> 05:58:19.320 align:start position:0%
is there any other comment about that
 
05:58:21.830 --> 05:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
bill I'm rep Santana would like to be in
 
05:58:23.270 --> 05:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
that community
 
05:58:25.730 --> 05:58:25.740 align:start position:0%
if we are are we going to make a
 
05:58:27.110 --> 05:58:27.120 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and that would be the
 
05:58:29.030 --> 05:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
question or can we have a committee the
 
05:58:31.368 --> 05:58:31.378 align:start position:0%
whole and have the group bring back some
 
05:58:34.850 --> 05:58:34.860 align:start position:0%
kind of a proposal for discussion
 
05:58:36.410 --> 05:58:36.420 align:start position:0%
that's you're not talking about the
 
05:58:39.590 --> 05:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittee right right back to the
 
05:58:43.310 --> 05:58:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:43.320 --> 05:58:44.510 align:start position:0%
 
any

05:58:44.510 --> 05:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
any
 
05:58:47.270 --> 05:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
so would the committee of the whole be
 
05:58:49.010 --> 05:58:49.020 align:start position:0%
working on
 
05:58:51.410 --> 05:58:51.420 align:start position:0%
draft language or would it be draft
 
05:58:53.150 --> 05:58:53.160 align:start position:0%
language that's brought I think we're
 
05:58:54.830 --> 05:58:54.840 align:start position:0%
just talking about membership on on it
 
05:58:54.840 --> 05:58:56.150 align:start position:0%
just talking about membership on on it
right

05:58:56.150 --> 05:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:58:58.430 --> 05:58:58.440 align:start position:0%
right but would we would be would
 
05:59:01.128 --> 05:59:01.138 align:start position:0%
essentially we'd be starting with the
 
05:59:04.970 --> 05:59:04.980 align:start position:0%
bill and then discussing whether a draft
 
05:59:07.548 --> 05:59:07.558 align:start position:0%
Amendment they would bring some draft
 
05:59:10.730 --> 05:59:10.740 align:start position:0%
material before and then however long it
 
05:59:12.650 --> 05:59:12.660 align:start position:0%
takes us hope to me the whole to look at
 
05:59:14.930 --> 05:59:14.940 align:start position:0%
it okay I think there's some very very
 
05:59:17.270 --> 05:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
important bills coming up in here this
 
05:59:19.430 --> 05:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
is a committee of membership
 
05:59:21.590 --> 05:59:21.600 align:start position:0%
which yes it's important but it's it's
 
05:59:24.788 --> 05:59:24.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:30.530 --> 05:59:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:32.930 --> 05:59:32.940 align:start position:0%
Mary did you have something
 
05:59:32.940 --> 05:59:34.730 align:start position:0%
Mary did you have something
no

05:59:34.730 --> 05:59:34.740 align:start position:0%
no
 
05:59:34.740 --> 05:59:37.010 align:start position:0%
no
no

05:59:37.010 --> 05:59:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:40.310 --> 05:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
are there any other related
 
05:59:42.530 --> 05:59:42.540 align:start position:0%
bills that would come up at the same
 
05:59:44.750 --> 05:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
time well let's look down through this
 
05:59:47.208 --> 05:59:47.218 align:start position:0%
list and see and and if we have to do
 
05:59:48.650 --> 05:59:48.660 align:start position:0%
something like that we could have you
 
05:59:51.470 --> 05:59:51.480 align:start position:0%
know Glenn and another individual and
 
05:59:53.150 --> 05:59:53.160 align:start position:0%
then we could get kadab involved who's
 
05:59:56.930 --> 05:59:56.940 align:start position:0%
on that particular Association already
 
05:59:58.670 --> 05:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
uh it should be people throughout food
 
06:00:00.230 --> 06:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
but if it's just a little work group and
 
06:00:02.690 --> 06:00:02.700 align:start position:0%
not a so-called bringing back some kind
 
06:00:04.368 --> 06:00:04.378 align:start position:0%
of draft to the committee that's going
 
06:00:06.948 --> 06:00:06.958 align:start position:0%
to look at committee the whole
 
06:00:08.810 --> 06:00:08.820 align:start position:0%
are there any other special edition okay
 
06:00:10.310 --> 06:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
let's go on down the list the next one
 
06:00:12.770 --> 06:00:12.780 align:start position:0%
down there is 155 charity
 
06:00:14.810 --> 06:00:14.820 align:start position:0%
indemnification private post-secondary
 
06:00:16.310 --> 06:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
so I thought we had a Senate Bill like
 
06:00:16.320 --> 06:00:17.170 align:start position:0%
so I thought we had a Senate Bill like
that

06:00:17.170 --> 06:00:17.180 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:00:19.090 --> 06:00:19.100 align:start position:0%
we did
 
06:00:22.490 --> 06:00:22.500 align:start position:0%
so do we need to do anything in this no
 
06:00:24.530 --> 06:00:24.540 align:start position:0%
so okay we can skip that one then and
 
06:00:27.470 --> 06:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
just deal with it later at Community
 
06:00:27.480 --> 06:00:29.330 align:start position:0%
just deal with it later at Community
hope

06:00:29.330 --> 06:00:29.340 align:start position:0%
hope
 
06:00:31.190 --> 06:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
um the next one down criminal background
 
06:00:34.970 --> 06:00:34.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:37.250 --> 06:00:37.260 align:start position:0%
can anybody remember
 
06:00:41.030 --> 06:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
exactly what this went after
 
06:00:43.730 --> 06:00:43.740 align:start position:0%
the principle that came in or a
 
06:00:45.230 --> 06:00:45.240 align:start position:0%
superintendent that came in and talked
 
06:00:48.048 --> 06:00:48.058 align:start position:0%
about wanting to do background checks on
 
06:00:50.868 --> 06:00:50.878 align:start position:0%
specific groups of people other than
 
06:00:53.030 --> 06:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
just that certification was that up at
 
06:01:00.770 --> 06:01:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:00.780 --> 06:01:02.930 align:start position:0%
 
oh

06:01:02.930 --> 06:01:02.940 align:start position:0%
oh
 
06:01:02.940 --> 06:01:13.128 align:start position:0%
oh
uh-huh

06:01:13.128 --> 06:01:13.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:15.530 --> 06:01:15.540 align:start position:0%
maybe it should be on the certification
 
06:01:20.170 --> 06:01:20.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:23.390 --> 06:01:23.400 align:start position:0%
and we also talked about that this is
 
06:01:25.430 --> 06:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
really isn't this the collective bar it
 
06:01:26.990 --> 06:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
could be a collective bargaining issue
 
06:01:29.090 --> 06:01:29.100 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah because talk about individual
 
06:01:33.788 --> 06:01:33.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:39.590 --> 06:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:46.910 --> 06:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:46.920 --> 06:01:58.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:01:58.990 --> 06:01:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:01.430 --> 06:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
dry you have your end up
 
06:02:04.970 --> 06:02:04.980 align:start position:0%
yes it was the golf town that he talked
 
06:02:07.310 --> 06:02:07.320 align:start position:0%
about that and we did get into the fact
 
06:02:09.288 --> 06:02:09.298 align:start position:0%
that we would maybe like to tie it into
 
06:02:10.610 --> 06:02:10.620 align:start position:0%
re-licensing and then we talked about
 
06:02:12.590 --> 06:02:12.600 align:start position:0%
there are other things that have to do
 
06:02:14.628 --> 06:02:14.638 align:start position:0%
with background checks that that perhaps
 
06:02:17.690 --> 06:02:17.700 align:start position:0%
would be included in this wider look at
 
06:02:20.030 --> 06:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
background checks
 
06:02:22.610 --> 06:02:22.620 align:start position:0%
is is it should we have a subcommittee
 
06:02:25.368 --> 06:02:25.378 align:start position:0%
on this or should we do a committee the
 
06:02:25.378 --> 06:02:26.510 align:start position:0%
on this or should we do a committee the
whole

06:02:26.510 --> 06:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
whole
 
06:02:28.610 --> 06:02:28.620 align:start position:0%
I think a subcommittee
 
06:02:28.620 --> 06:02:31.128 align:start position:0%
I think a subcommittee
okay

06:02:31.128 --> 06:02:31.138 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:02:35.030 --> 06:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
I have a note that IT addresses
 
06:02:37.548 --> 06:02:37.558 align:start position:0%
um staff that's been hired prior to the
 
06:02:37.558 --> 06:02:38.330 align:start position:0%
um staff that's been hired prior to the
law

06:02:38.330 --> 06:02:38.340 align:start position:0%
law
 
06:02:38.340 --> 06:02:39.350 align:start position:0%
law
right

06:02:39.350 --> 06:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:02:43.070 --> 06:02:43.080 align:start position:0%
right yeah okay the next one down I put
 
06:02:45.070 --> 06:02:45.080 align:start position:0%
down the subcommittee uh
 
06:02:49.548 --> 06:02:49.558 align:start position:0%
hb352 excuse absences mental uh size
 
06:02:51.948 --> 06:02:51.958 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health we have a number of
 
06:02:53.390 --> 06:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
bills here dealing with mental health
 
06:02:56.208 --> 06:02:56.218 align:start position:0%
yes so why don't we combine all the ones
 
06:02:57.410 --> 06:02:57.420 align:start position:0%
that have to deal with mental health
 
06:03:00.650 --> 06:03:00.660 align:start position:0%
into one organ one subcommittee
 
06:03:07.730 --> 06:03:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:15.470 --> 06:03:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:19.788 --> 06:03:19.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:25.970 --> 06:03:25.980 align:start position:0%
right 505 yeah 151 352. yeah
 
06:03:25.980 --> 06:03:28.788 align:start position:0%
right 505 yeah 151 352. yeah
okay

06:03:28.788 --> 06:03:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:30.890 --> 06:03:30.900 align:start position:0%
so it looks like there's three bills in
 
06:03:30.900 --> 06:03:33.288 align:start position:0%
so it looks like there's three bills in
there

06:03:33.288 --> 06:03:33.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:36.410 --> 06:03:36.420 align:start position:0%
okay going down to the next one
 
06:03:40.970 --> 06:03:40.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:43.128 --> 06:03:43.138 align:start position:0%
Charter School building no this is one
 
06:03:46.548 --> 06:03:46.558 align:start position:0%
we do need a subcommittee on because we
 
06:03:48.170 --> 06:03:48.180 align:start position:0%
want to expand it we're going to discuss
 
06:03:50.930 --> 06:03:50.940 align:start position:0%
building Aid period as well
 
06:03:50.940 --> 06:03:54.250 align:start position:0%
building Aid period as well
and

06:03:54.250 --> 06:03:54.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:56.208 --> 06:03:56.218 align:start position:0%
Mary I wish you were on this committee
 
06:03:57.708 --> 06:03:57.718 align:start position:0%

it's it was taken out the other day from
 
06:04:07.910 --> 06:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
hb2 and uh because we work we're not
 
06:04:10.850 --> 06:04:10.860 align:start position:0%
ready to go there yet so we've got to
 
06:04:12.830 --> 06:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
look at that whole chat or Charter
 
06:04:15.048 --> 06:04:15.058 align:start position:0%
School law we gotta also look at school
 
06:04:17.030 --> 06:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
building eight in terms of if you're a
 
06:04:18.770 --> 06:04:18.780 align:start position:0%
member of the
 
06:04:21.730 --> 06:04:21.740 align:start position:0%
J.R whole Amendment
 
06:04:26.150 --> 06:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
which came up in division two and we
 
06:04:28.010 --> 06:04:28.020 align:start position:0%
have Amy Clark that says I'd like to
 
06:04:29.810 --> 06:04:29.820 align:start position:0%
engage she has some good ideas she'd
 
06:04:31.310 --> 06:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
like to move forward on so there will be
 
06:04:33.110 --> 06:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee on this one
 
06:04:35.030 --> 06:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
this is probably one of the more
 
06:04:41.510 --> 06:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:43.850 --> 06:04:43.860 align:start position:0%
okay uh reading assessment and
 
06:04:45.890 --> 06:04:45.900 align:start position:0%
Intervention Program
 
06:04:45.900 --> 06:04:47.990 align:start position:0%
Intervention Program
437

06:04:47.990 --> 06:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
437
 
06:04:50.930 --> 06:04:50.940 align:start position:0%
was this similar it was dyslexia right
 
06:04:54.350 --> 06:04:54.360 align:start position:0%
that was my uh larger bill yeah um and I
 
06:04:56.510 --> 06:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
I've been working on some tweaks and I
 
06:04:58.010 --> 06:04:58.020 align:start position:0%
hope I can bring that back to the
 
06:04:59.510 --> 06:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
committee the whole
 
06:05:01.730 --> 06:05:01.740 align:start position:0%
would you like to have any subcommittee
 
06:05:04.910 --> 06:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
on that no I don't think it needs it
 
06:05:07.010 --> 06:05:07.020 align:start position:0%
okay we what where's the status of the
 
06:05:08.868 --> 06:05:08.878 align:start position:0%
dyslexia bill right now that got passed
 
06:05:11.448 --> 06:05:11.458 align:start position:0%
that got passed okay so okay so we'll
 
06:05:17.330 --> 06:05:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:17.340 --> 06:05:18.650 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:05:18.650 --> 06:05:18.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:05:21.770 --> 06:05:21.780 align:start position:0%
439 relative duty to provide education
 
06:05:25.250 --> 06:05:25.260 align:start position:0%
and contracts with privates I I I don't
 
06:05:26.868 --> 06:05:26.878 align:start position:0%
have the whole bill in front of me uh or
 
06:05:28.730 --> 06:05:28.740 align:start position:0%
a title
 
06:05:33.170 --> 06:05:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:36.310 --> 06:05:36.320 align:start position:0%
and also duty to provide anything
 
06:05:41.150 --> 06:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
yes it's the one that says repeals the
 
06:05:42.770 --> 06:05:42.780 align:start position:0%
authority of a school board to execute a
 
06:05:44.570 --> 06:05:44.580 align:start position:0%
contract with a non-sectarian private
 
06:05:46.850 --> 06:05:46.860 align:start position:0%
school and also
 
06:05:49.250 --> 06:05:49.260 align:start position:0%
to extend education until the people's
 
06:05:54.770 --> 06:05:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:57.310 --> 06:05:57.320 align:start position:0%
well we got the edge case through age
 
06:06:00.770 --> 06:06:00.780 align:start position:0%
222 right I believe he had missed one
 
06:06:06.230 --> 06:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:09.708 --> 06:06:09.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:12.650 --> 06:06:12.660 align:start position:0%
okay so do we need a a subcommittee on
 
06:06:12.660 --> 06:06:13.788 align:start position:0%
okay so do we need a a subcommittee on
that

06:06:13.788 --> 06:06:13.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:06:15.948 --> 06:06:15.958 align:start position:0%
or is that something we could take care
 
06:06:19.788 --> 06:06:19.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:21.350 --> 06:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
I think we ought to be able to do that
 
06:06:22.910 --> 06:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be like an in-depth
 
06:06:24.708 --> 06:06:24.718 align:start position:0%
study like building eight
 
06:06:30.590 --> 06:06:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:34.128 --> 06:06:34.138 align:start position:0%
um we did 505
 
06:06:43.010 --> 06:06:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:45.670 --> 06:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
that that was another one of my bills
 
06:06:49.030 --> 06:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
that required
 
06:06:52.730 --> 06:06:52.740 align:start position:0%
salaries right and um yeah based on the
 
06:06:55.010 --> 06:06:55.020 align:start position:0%
testimony that we heard at that point I
 
06:06:57.770 --> 06:06:57.780 align:start position:0%
will uh tweet the bill and bring it back
 
06:07:00.048 --> 06:07:00.058 align:start position:0%
remember that's the one word I brought
 
06:07:01.548 --> 06:07:01.558 align:start position:0%
in the Haverhill annual report and
 
06:07:04.490 --> 06:07:04.500 align:start position:0%
they're all listed in that
 
06:07:07.548 --> 06:07:07.558 align:start position:0%
yeah so we'll wait for the committee to
 
06:07:10.310 --> 06:07:10.320 align:start position:0%
hold and see what you bring forward
 
06:07:10.320 --> 06:07:11.868 align:start position:0%
hold and see what you bring forward
okay

06:07:11.868 --> 06:07:11.878 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:07:11.878 --> 06:07:13.810 align:start position:0%
okay
um

06:07:13.810 --> 06:07:13.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:07:13.820 --> 06:07:15.770 align:start position:0%
um
577

06:07:15.770 --> 06:07:15.780 align:start position:0%
577
 
06:07:18.650 --> 06:07:18.660 align:start position:0%
I think there's another huge topic here
 
06:07:22.670 --> 06:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
uh special education support financial
 
06:07:25.610 --> 06:07:25.620 align:start position:0%
support we had a bill where we were
 
06:07:27.890 --> 06:07:27.900 align:start position:0%
trying to help differentiated Aid that
 
06:07:32.030 --> 06:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
got torn apart in division two
 
06:07:35.030 --> 06:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
yeah and uh we had another bill on
 
06:07:37.730 --> 06:07:37.740 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid as well our our special
 
06:07:40.128 --> 06:07:40.138 align:start position:0%
ed Aid that's where the three and a half
 
06:07:42.110 --> 06:07:42.120 align:start position:0%
times was reduced down to two and a half
 
06:07:44.570 --> 06:07:44.580 align:start position:0%
or one and a half uh tremendous
 
06:07:46.250 --> 06:07:46.260 align:start position:0%
financial implications for that but we
 
06:07:48.890 --> 06:07:48.900 align:start position:0%
need to work on this so that's a
 
06:07:55.070 --> 06:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:58.310 --> 06:07:58.320 align:start position:0%
loan forgiveness 623 teacher loan
 
06:08:00.410 --> 06:08:00.420 align:start position:0%
forgiveness program that was serious one
 
06:08:09.310 --> 06:08:09.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:11.150 --> 06:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
looked at here
 
06:08:13.548 --> 06:08:13.558 align:start position:0%
did you mention the higher ed commission
 
06:08:15.948 --> 06:08:15.958 align:start position:0%
related to Salmon also which one said no
 
06:08:18.530 --> 06:08:18.540 align:start position:0%
that loan forgiveness I think there was
 
06:08:19.788 --> 06:08:19.798 align:start position:0%
some discussion about the higher ed
 
06:08:21.590 --> 06:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
commission looking at that
 
06:08:28.190 --> 06:08:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:30.230 --> 06:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
The Higher Education commission's
 
06:08:32.930 --> 06:08:32.940 align:start position:0%
meeting on the fifth I think
 
06:08:36.708 --> 06:08:36.718 align:start position:0%
and the issues which we're dealing with
 
06:08:38.810 --> 06:08:38.820 align:start position:0%
well we don't have I don't think loan
 
06:08:40.368 --> 06:08:40.378 align:start position:0%
forgiveness is on there we have the
 
06:08:43.490 --> 06:08:43.500 align:start position:0%
Provost coming in from PSU we have Wayne
 
06:08:45.470 --> 06:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
Jones coming in from the
 
06:08:48.610 --> 06:08:48.620 align:start position:0%
University system talking about
 
06:08:53.690 --> 06:08:53.700 align:start position:0%
the issues there of uh enrollments and
 
06:08:55.970 --> 06:08:55.980 align:start position:0%
um there's one other topics on there now
 
06:08:55.980 --> 06:08:57.230 align:start position:0%
um there's one other topics on there now
too

06:08:57.230 --> 06:08:57.240 align:start position:0%
too
 
06:08:59.448 --> 06:08:59.458 align:start position:0%
um there's a number of so we're loaded
 
06:09:04.368 --> 06:09:04.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:07.128 --> 06:09:07.138 align:start position:0%
it's I'm okay with it and if we can get
 
06:09:09.350 --> 06:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
the people that do it
 
06:09:09.360 --> 06:09:13.850 align:start position:0%
the people that do it
okay

06:09:13.850 --> 06:09:13.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:13.860 --> 06:09:15.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:09:15.110 --> 06:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:09:15.120 --> 06:09:15.770 align:start position:0%
okay
um

06:09:15.770 --> 06:09:15.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:09:19.190 --> 06:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
the next one is attendance admr for
 
06:09:23.990 --> 06:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
school districts and at 6 25 and 6 30 7.
 
06:09:26.810 --> 06:09:26.820 align:start position:0%
attendance for homeschoolers
 
06:09:29.448 --> 06:09:29.458 align:start position:0%
so those two could be combined
 
06:09:35.570 --> 06:09:35.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:35.580 --> 06:09:39.590 align:start position:0%
 
different

06:09:39.590 --> 06:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:39.600 --> 06:09:43.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:09:43.910 --> 06:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:55.610 --> 06:09:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:57.890 --> 06:09:57.900 align:start position:0%
yeah I think so too and I think they
 
06:10:03.890 --> 06:10:03.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:06.850 --> 06:10:06.860 align:start position:0%
yeah on on those two bills 625 637
 
06:10:11.030 --> 06:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
looking at the next one down 628
 
06:10:18.110 --> 06:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:20.090 --> 06:10:20.100 align:start position:0%
local education Improvement plans and
 
06:10:21.530 --> 06:10:21.540 align:start position:0%
disparities in education that's much
 
06:10:23.208 --> 06:10:23.218 align:start position:0%
like I think representative Moffett
 
06:10:25.010 --> 06:10:25.020 align:start position:0%
didn't you have something like that
 
06:10:25.020 --> 06:10:27.170 align:start position:0%
didn't you have something like that
we're

06:10:27.170 --> 06:10:27.180 align:start position:0%
we're
 
06:10:30.110 --> 06:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
is that is that his bill yeah
 
06:10:32.930 --> 06:10:32.940 align:start position:0%
where the Improvement for mathematics is
 
06:10:35.288 --> 06:10:35.298 align:start position:0%
the funding yeah yeah
 
06:10:38.590 --> 06:10:38.600 align:start position:0%
that's not this one though
 
06:10:42.890 --> 06:10:42.900 align:start position:0%
uh we're on 620s
 
06:10:42.900 --> 06:10:52.970 align:start position:0%
uh we're on 620s
genetically

06:10:52.970 --> 06:10:52.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:04.070 --> 06:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:05.810 --> 06:11:05.820 align:start position:0%
this is something that could be done
 
06:11:08.190 --> 06:11:08.200 align:start position:0%
quickly through a committee to hold
 
06:11:08.200 --> 06:11:13.330 align:start position:0%
quickly through a committee to hold
[Music]

06:11:13.330 --> 06:11:13.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:19.010 --> 06:11:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:19.020 --> 06:11:22.090 align:start position:0%
 
quicker

06:11:22.090 --> 06:11:22.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:24.590 --> 06:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
okay let's take a break from this we got
 
06:11:31.670 --> 06:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:31.680 --> 06:11:45.490 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:11:45.490 --> 06:11:45.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:49.330 --> 06:11:49.340 align:start position:0%
so we'll reopen up the exec session for
 
06:11:53.690 --> 06:11:53.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:53.700 --> 06:11:59.930 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:11:59.930 --> 06:11:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:03.070 --> 06:12:03.080 align:start position:0%
so I'll make a motion OTP on Amendment
 
06:12:08.150 --> 06:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
2061h and represent Miler seconds it
 
06:12:08.160 --> 06:12:09.708 align:start position:0%
2061h and represent Miler seconds it
discussion

06:12:09.708 --> 06:12:09.718 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
06:12:12.410 --> 06:12:12.420 align:start position:0%
uh I think we've discussed anybody else
 
06:12:15.470 --> 06:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:19.490 --> 06:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:21.530 --> 06:12:21.540 align:start position:0%
I still think
 
06:12:25.070 --> 06:12:25.080 align:start position:0%
and we didn't really discuss the issues
 
06:12:27.708 --> 06:12:27.718 align:start position:0%
of opening students up to social media
 
06:12:28.970 --> 06:12:28.980 align:start position:0%
in general
 
06:12:32.390 --> 06:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
and this does allow students to be
 
06:12:35.868 --> 06:12:35.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:43.070 --> 06:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:46.548 --> 06:12:46.558 align:start position:0%
I can't hear you sir I'm sorry yeah
 
06:12:48.470 --> 06:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
that's correct that's that's a correct
 
06:12:50.948 --> 06:12:50.958 align:start position:0%
reference yeah
 
06:12:55.070 --> 06:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
the the statutory reference of 189.70 up
 
06:12:58.310 --> 06:12:58.320 align:start position:0%

06:21:20.030 --> 06:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
no we didn't I think we're waiting until
 
06:21:21.890 --> 06:21:21.900 align:start position:0%
they came here waiting to see how the
 
06:21:24.530 --> 06:21:24.540 align:start position:0%
Titan II funds could be used for that
 
06:21:27.310 --> 06:21:27.320 align:start position:0%
yeah that's right we have it was Melissa
 
06:21:29.750 --> 06:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to work with doe on that we
 
06:21:32.030 --> 06:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
were working with doe on that
 
06:21:34.070 --> 06:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
yeah so I think that'd be a committee
 
06:21:36.650 --> 06:21:36.660 align:start position:0%
the whole it's a whole group and then
 
06:21:36.660 --> 06:21:39.048 align:start position:0%
the whole it's a whole group and then
266

06:21:39.048 --> 06:21:39.058 align:start position:0%
266
 
06:21:41.690 --> 06:21:41.700 align:start position:0%
um Statewide Improvement and Assessment
 
06:21:41.700 --> 06:21:43.430 align:start position:0%
um Statewide Improvement and Assessment
program

06:21:43.430 --> 06:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
program
 
06:21:54.010 --> 06:21:54.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:57.890 --> 06:21:57.900 align:start position:0%
quite frankly I think that's so large
 
06:21:59.690 --> 06:21:59.700 align:start position:0%
that we'll be lucky to get that thing
 
06:21:59.700 --> 06:22:05.750 align:start position:0%
that we'll be lucky to get that thing
done

06:22:05.750 --> 06:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:05.760 --> 06:22:07.190 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:22:07.190 --> 06:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:22:09.048 --> 06:22:09.058 align:start position:0%
is there anybody here wants to spend a
 
06:22:12.890 --> 06:22:12.900 align:start position:0%
lot of time on 266 this summer and fall
 
06:22:15.350 --> 06:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
uh no
 
06:22:17.930 --> 06:22:17.940 align:start position:0%
okay that's a committee of the whole and
 
06:22:20.810 --> 06:22:20.820 align:start position:0%
it's something where if anybody wants to
 
06:22:22.128 --> 06:22:22.138 align:start position:0%
look through some of this stuff bring
 
06:22:25.190 --> 06:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
your ideas to the committee of the whole
 
06:22:35.930 --> 06:22:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:38.930 --> 06:22:38.940 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah we we sort of can I don't
 
06:22:51.730 --> 06:22:51.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:55.610 --> 06:22:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:55.620 --> 06:22:57.230 align:start position:0%
 
commentary

06:22:57.230 --> 06:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
commentary
 
06:22:59.868 --> 06:22:59.878 align:start position:0%
we didn't get through it all though
 
06:23:02.090 --> 06:23:02.100 align:start position:0%
we didn't finish the last several pages
 
06:23:05.690 --> 06:23:05.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:05.700 --> 06:23:14.868 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:23:14.868 --> 06:23:14.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:17.948 --> 06:23:17.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:24.410 --> 06:23:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:26.510 --> 06:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
I think that to do this we're going to
 
06:23:28.670 --> 06:23:28.680 align:start position:0%
have to spend some time with Caitlin and
 
06:23:30.350 --> 06:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
Nate green
 
06:23:33.650 --> 06:23:33.660 align:start position:0%
and I think a lot of it's tied up to the
 
06:23:40.030 --> 06:23:40.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:42.788 --> 06:23:42.798 align:start position:0%
if anybody wants to get engaged in that
 
06:23:47.410 --> 06:23:47.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:49.850 --> 06:23:49.860 align:start position:0%
it's a long session that makes it even
 
06:23:49.860 --> 06:23:51.530 align:start position:0%
it's a long session that makes it even
longer

06:23:51.530 --> 06:23:51.540 align:start position:0%
longer
 
06:23:53.868 --> 06:23:53.878 align:start position:0%
um so we'll we'll get we'll get more
 
06:23:55.670 --> 06:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
information from them so when we do have
 
06:23:57.288 --> 06:23:57.298 align:start position:0%
the committee the whole we can scoot
 
06:23:59.810 --> 06:23:59.820 align:start position:0%
through it as quickly but I don't I'm
 
06:24:02.868 --> 06:24:02.878 align:start position:0%
not holding my breath on that
 
06:24:02.878 --> 06:24:15.368 align:start position:0%
not holding my breath on that
foreign

06:24:15.368 --> 06:24:15.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:19.970 --> 06:24:19.980 align:start position:0%
sex is a different cat this is combining
 
06:24:22.548 --> 06:24:22.558 align:start position:0%
the adequacy and the delivery of
 
06:24:25.670 --> 06:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
adequacy and all 193 sections and it's
 
06:24:27.708 --> 06:24:27.718 align:start position:0%
trying to stop the repetition and then
 
06:24:29.930 --> 06:24:29.940 align:start position:0%
try to make it easier to read I don't
 
06:24:31.730 --> 06:24:31.740 align:start position:0%
know if it's doing that
 
06:24:34.910 --> 06:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
it's very confusing
 
06:24:36.350 --> 06:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
this is the type of thing you have to
 
06:24:38.510 --> 06:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
hire a contractor to do and give them
 
06:24:43.490 --> 06:24:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:45.948 --> 06:24:45.958 align:start position:0%
yeah has anybody been to the 306
 
06:24:47.868 --> 06:24:47.878 align:start position:0%
hearings I was going to go to one up New
 
06:25:01.970 --> 06:25:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:01.980 --> 06:25:03.948 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:25:03.948 --> 06:25:03.958 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:25:06.410 --> 06:25:06.420 align:start position:0%
so what we'll do is I'll work with
 
06:25:08.150 --> 06:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
representative miler in getting the
 
06:25:10.128 --> 06:25:10.138 align:start position:0%
names of people for subcommittees is
 
06:25:12.530 --> 06:25:12.540 align:start position:0%
there any subcommittee that somebody
 
06:25:15.288 --> 06:25:15.298 align:start position:0%
would like to be on
 
06:25:15.298 --> 06:25:16.730 align:start position:0%
would like to be on
really

06:25:16.730 --> 06:25:16.740 align:start position:0%
really
 
06:25:19.910 --> 06:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
Balboni representative Balboni
 
06:25:26.810 --> 06:25:26.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:26.820 --> 06:25:29.288 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:25:29.288 --> 06:25:29.298 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:25:32.270 --> 06:25:32.280 align:start position:0%
yeah let's get all the stuff for me to
 
06:25:35.868 --> 06:25:35.878 align:start position:0%
do yeah yeah so I think what what your
 
06:25:38.690 --> 06:25:38.700 align:start position:0%
your uh representative Myler will do is
 
06:25:41.350 --> 06:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
he'll just contact his caucus
 
06:25:44.090 --> 06:25:44.100 align:start position:0%
and and determine and he'll probably be
 
06:25:46.190 --> 06:25:46.200 align:start position:0%
asking that type of a question to you
 
06:25:48.110 --> 06:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
okay not do the same thing with the
 
06:25:50.390 --> 06:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
Republicans that way we can scoot out of
 
06:25:50.400 --> 06:25:51.410 align:start position:0%
Republicans that way we can scoot out of
here

06:25:51.410 --> 06:25:51.420 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:25:53.330 --> 06:25:53.340 align:start position:0%
um the only other thing which we had
 
06:25:54.770 --> 06:25:54.780 align:start position:0%
down well we had the committee
 
06:25:56.270 --> 06:25:56.280 align:start position:0%
conference and what I'm going to do is
 
06:25:58.190 --> 06:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
we have some side by sides for the four
 
06:25:58.200 --> 06:25:59.510 align:start position:0%
we have some side by sides for the four
bills

06:25:59.510 --> 06:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
bills
 
06:26:02.448 --> 06:26:02.458 align:start position:0%
look them over we can only recommend to
 
06:26:04.430 --> 06:26:04.440 align:start position:0%
concur non-concur or recommend a
 
06:26:07.030 --> 06:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
committee conference
 
06:26:07.040 --> 06:26:08.930 align:start position:0%
committee conference
yet

06:26:08.930 --> 06:26:08.940 align:start position:0%
yet
 
06:26:11.030 --> 06:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
I I do have the side by sides right here
 
06:26:12.890 --> 06:26:12.900 align:start position:0%
so I can give you copies
 
06:26:15.230 --> 06:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
so before you head out of here come on
 
06:26:17.448 --> 06:26:17.458 align:start position:0%
up here and get
 
06:26:19.730 --> 06:26:19.740 align:start position:0%
one of each
 
06:26:21.590 --> 06:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
and then what I will do is I will
 
06:26:24.410 --> 06:26:24.420 align:start position:0%
contact you by the web
 
06:26:26.330 --> 06:26:26.340 align:start position:0%
trying to find out where the individuals
 
06:26:27.890 --> 06:26:27.900 align:start position:0%
are this way we've done a lot of times
 
06:26:29.930 --> 06:26:29.940 align:start position:0%
in the past sometimes we meet prior to
 
06:26:32.390 --> 06:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
session or after session in a corner of
 
06:26:33.288 --> 06:26:33.298 align:start position:0%
the hall
 
06:26:35.750 --> 06:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
and go through it quickly
 
06:26:35.760 --> 06:26:36.288 align:start position:0%
and go through it quickly
um

06:26:36.288 --> 06:26:36.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:26:38.510 --> 06:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
there's several ways of doing it some
 
06:26:41.930 --> 06:26:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:41.940 --> 06:26:44.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:26:44.150 --> 06:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:26:46.670 --> 06:26:46.680 align:start position:0%
so I got the these reports right here
 
06:26:49.010 --> 06:26:49.020 align:start position:0%
I'll put all four of them
 
06:26:50.868 --> 06:26:50.878 align:start position:0%
right here in front of where
 
06:26:52.610 --> 06:26:52.620 align:start position:0%
representative Ford usually sets some
 
06:26:52.620 --> 06:27:02.750 align:start position:0%
representative Ford usually sets some
cardiola

06:27:02.750 --> 06:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:02.760 --> 06:27:05.628 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:27:05.628 --> 06:27:05.638 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:27:10.548 --> 06:27:10.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:12.470 --> 06:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
next week
 
06:27:15.470 --> 06:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
yeah and what's
 
06:27:17.090 --> 06:27:17.100 align:start position:0%
anybody interested in knowing where we
 
06:27:20.208 --> 06:27:20.218 align:start position:0%
are in the finance stuff yeah
 
06:27:20.218 --> 06:27:23.868 align:start position:0%
are in the finance stuff yeah
okay

06:27:23.868 --> 06:27:23.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:26.390 --> 06:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
we have uh
 
06:27:29.690 --> 06:27:29.700 align:start position:0%
senate had a exact session and with fine
 
06:27:31.910 --> 06:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
the finance uh
 
06:27:34.730 --> 06:27:34.740 align:start position:0%
on Friday last week
 
06:27:39.170 --> 06:27:39.180 align:start position:0%
and in that they did not take hb2 our
 
06:27:39.180 --> 06:27:41.048 align:start position:0%
and in that they did not take hb2 our
recommendation

06:27:41.048 --> 06:27:41.058 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
06:27:45.288 --> 06:27:45.298 align:start position:0%
they are rewriting it the base cost is
 
06:27:48.048 --> 06:27:48.058 align:start position:0%
at forty one hundred dollars
 
06:27:50.270 --> 06:27:50.280 align:start position:0%
then they're taking that amount and
 
06:27:52.368 --> 06:27:52.378 align:start position:0%
throwing it over on the other side of
 
06:27:54.250 --> 06:27:54.260 align:start position:0%
the column in the education
 
06:27:57.350 --> 06:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant which is based
 
06:27:59.810 --> 06:27:59.820 align:start position:0%
upon extraordinary needs based on Prop
 
06:28:02.868 --> 06:28:02.878 align:start position:0%
but F and R qualifiers the number gives
 
06:28:05.448 --> 06:28:05.458 align:start position:0%
is based on F and R not on your total
 
06:28:07.850 --> 06:28:07.860 align:start position:0%
population of your school
 
06:28:12.590 --> 06:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
stabilization is also uh eliminated over
 
06:28:14.750 --> 06:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
a period of ratcheting that's it four or
 
06:28:17.150 --> 06:28:17.160 align:start position:0%
five years I think it's five years it
 
06:28:19.970 --> 06:28:19.980 align:start position:0%
ratchets down the way they do that is
 
06:28:22.730 --> 06:28:22.740 align:start position:0%
they have a hold harmless which they're
 
06:28:26.868 --> 06:28:26.878 align:start position:0%
starting back in 2009 we had to hold RMS
 
06:28:28.730 --> 06:28:28.740 align:start position:0%
but it was a very small amount of money
 
06:28:32.150 --> 06:28:32.160 align:start position:0%
about 20 27 28 million dollars
 
06:28:34.490 --> 06:28:34.500 align:start position:0%
this whole harmless is 63 million
 
06:28:34.500 --> 06:28:36.048 align:start position:0%
this whole harmless is 63 million
dollars

06:28:36.048 --> 06:28:36.058 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
06:28:38.208 --> 06:28:38.218 align:start position:0%
and it was lower when they first came
 
06:28:42.590 --> 06:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
around 50 million dollars but uh
 
06:28:42.600 --> 06:28:43.970 align:start position:0%
around 50 million dollars but uh
the

06:28:43.970 --> 06:28:43.980 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:28:47.090 --> 06:28:47.100 align:start position:0%
Senate was informed that by doing what
 
06:28:48.830 --> 06:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
they're doing with only 50 million
 
06:28:50.330 --> 06:28:50.340 align:start position:0%
dollars there
 
06:28:52.670 --> 06:28:52.680 align:start position:0%
the property poor towns
 
06:28:55.788 --> 06:28:55.798 align:start position:0%
were really low much lower than they
 
06:28:58.010 --> 06:28:58.020 align:start position:0%
were with our HP
 
06:29:00.350 --> 06:29:00.360 align:start position:0%
to proposal
 
06:29:03.350 --> 06:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
so then they took
 
06:29:05.690 --> 06:29:05.700 align:start position:0%
that difference there about what 13
 
06:29:08.270 --> 06:29:08.280 align:start position:0%
million roughly and put that into hold
 
06:29:11.868 --> 06:29:11.878 align:start position:0%
harmless and it UPS it a little bit for
 
06:29:14.570 --> 06:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
the property poor towns initially
 
06:29:18.170 --> 06:29:18.180 align:start position:0%
the city of Manchester in the first
 
06:29:21.110 --> 06:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
Senate proposal received 27 million
 
06:29:25.190 --> 06:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
dollars addition to what they would have
 
06:29:25.200 --> 06:29:26.230 align:start position:0%
dollars addition to what they would have
received

06:29:26.230 --> 06:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
received
 
06:29:29.510 --> 06:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
from current law
 
06:29:31.310 --> 06:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
um we we uh
 
06:29:33.470 --> 06:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
we objected to that seeing that the
 
06:29:35.510 --> 06:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
property poor towns were not getting
 
06:29:37.850 --> 06:29:37.860 align:start position:0%
hardly anything they were whole they
 
06:29:40.128 --> 06:29:40.138 align:start position:0%
weren't losing but they're very close to
 
06:29:42.230 --> 06:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
the current level of funding
 
06:29:44.690 --> 06:29:44.700 align:start position:0%
and so with that we
 
06:29:47.270 --> 06:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
um convinced them to go to instead of a
 
06:29:50.990 --> 06:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
102 of them of the whole house went 104
 
06:29:51.000 --> 06:29:52.128 align:start position:0%
102 of them of the whole house went 104
percent

06:29:52.128 --> 06:29:52.138 align:start position:0%
percent
 
06:29:54.530 --> 06:29:54.540 align:start position:0%
so it went four percent up
 
06:29:57.048 --> 06:29:57.058 align:start position:0%
and it took that 13 million dollars and
 
06:29:59.330 --> 06:29:59.340 align:start position:0%
slugged it in there that's where we
 
06:30:05.948 --> 06:30:05.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:08.110 --> 06:30:08.120 align:start position:0%
100 100
 
06:30:12.770 --> 06:30:12.780 align:start position:0%
it was what 150 million plus dollars 156
 
06:30:13.970 --> 06:30:13.980 align:start position:0%
million bucks
 
06:30:16.310 --> 06:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
five percent overall
 
06:30:19.190 --> 06:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
about five years I think no immediately
 
06:30:22.368 --> 06:30:22.378 align:start position:0%
it's immediate but there's oh yeah
 
06:30:25.010 --> 06:30:25.020 align:start position:0%
they're reducing slowly the whole
 
06:30:27.230 --> 06:30:27.240 align:start position:0%
harmless which pumps back into the
 
06:30:29.750 --> 06:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
formula which hold harmless reduces over
 
06:30:33.948 --> 06:30:33.958 align:start position:0%
a decade yeah yeah per biennial
 
06:30:41.288 --> 06:30:41.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:43.970 --> 06:30:43.980 align:start position:0%
full stabilization
 
06:30:47.390 --> 06:30:47.400 align:start position:0%
no we have not touched stabilization
 
06:30:50.330 --> 06:30:50.340 align:start position:0%
stabilization took a tip
 
06:30:53.150 --> 06:30:53.160 align:start position:0%
years ago and was restored four years
 
06:30:56.930 --> 06:30:56.940 align:start position:0%
ago or six years yeah
 
06:31:00.070 --> 06:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
um back to 100 in 2012 numbers right
 
06:31:04.548 --> 06:31:04.558 align:start position:0%
yeah and so the Senate proposal will be
 
06:31:07.010 --> 06:31:07.020 align:start position:0%
to eliminate stabilization starting in
 
06:31:11.048 --> 06:31:11.058 align:start position:0%
FY 24 and and that
 
06:31:14.330 --> 06:31:14.340 align:start position:0%
two new components extraordinary needs
 
06:31:18.948 --> 06:31:18.958 align:start position:0%
Grant which um which is more generously
 
06:31:20.750 --> 06:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
funded than the current extraordinary in
 
06:31:23.570 --> 06:31:23.580 align:start position:0%
each screen is that an old harmless to
 
06:31:23.580 --> 06:31:24.530 align:start position:0%
each screen is that an old harmless to
bring

06:31:24.530 --> 06:31:24.540 align:start position:0%
bring
 
06:31:28.670 --> 06:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
everybody back up if if you were below
 
06:31:32.330 --> 06:31:32.340 align:start position:0%
your your current FY 24 estimate that
 
06:31:35.030 --> 06:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
came out in October
 
06:31:37.788 --> 06:31:37.798 align:start position:0%
um then um then it would bring you up to
 
06:31:42.770 --> 06:31:42.780 align:start position:0%
102 uh and I think now 104 of what that
 
06:31:47.030 --> 06:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
estimate was so so for most towns like
 
06:31:49.910 --> 06:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
well let me say another way or for for
 
06:31:53.628 --> 06:31:53.638 align:start position:0%
cities like Manchester and Nashua that
 
06:31:55.850 --> 06:31:55.860 align:start position:0%
have a high number
 
06:31:58.730 --> 06:31:58.740 align:start position:0%
a high number of both pre-introduced
 
06:32:03.788 --> 06:32:03.798 align:start position:0%
price lunch students and um and and uh
 
06:32:06.410 --> 06:32:06.420 align:start position:0%
and less than um
 
06:32:07.788 --> 06:32:07.798 align:start position:0%
I think it's
 
06:32:11.150 --> 06:32:11.160 align:start position:0%
it's uh less than six million or 6.6
 
06:32:14.270 --> 06:32:14.280 align:start position:0%
million dollars evaluation per free
 
06:32:17.628 --> 06:32:17.638 align:start position:0%
reduced price lunch student they uh they
 
06:32:21.048 --> 06:32:21.058 align:start position:0%
get a substantial additional Grant so it
 
06:32:24.410 --> 06:32:24.420 align:start position:0%
so Manchester Nashua who
 
06:32:27.110 --> 06:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
you know at least according to all our
 
06:32:30.230 --> 06:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
work you know need need additional
 
06:32:33.110 --> 06:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
support from the state but um but places
 
06:32:36.170 --> 06:32:36.180 align:start position:0%
like Berlin and Claremont and dairy
 
06:32:38.868 --> 06:32:38.878 align:start position:0%
um would get basically four percent more
 
06:32:40.910 --> 06:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
than they're currently getting and
 
06:32:43.850 --> 06:32:43.860 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what what um what the
 
06:32:46.788 --> 06:32:46.798 align:start position:0%
current Senate plan is doing
 
06:32:46.798 --> 06:32:47.510 align:start position:0%
current Senate plan is doing
um

06:32:47.510 --> 06:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:32:49.670 --> 06:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
yeah in the uh
 
06:32:51.708 --> 06:32:51.718 align:start position:0%
Berlin currently
 
06:32:56.208 --> 06:32:56.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:59.750 --> 06:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
and then yeah under the uh Amendment
 
06:33:01.868 --> 06:33:01.878 align:start position:0%
from the Senate you would get 11.5
 
06:33:04.490 --> 06:33:04.500 align:start position:0%
million dollars right
 
06:33:06.948 --> 06:33:06.958 align:start position:0%
under under the house Amendment you've
 
06:33:11.330 --> 06:33:11.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:13.850 --> 06:33:13.860 align:start position:0%
so if they're that's the the two cities
 
06:33:15.910 --> 06:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
which kind of take it in the shorts
 
06:33:18.490 --> 06:33:18.500 align:start position:0%
Berlin and Franklin
 
06:33:22.368 --> 06:33:22.378 align:start position:0%
Claremont Mr Claremont yep
 
06:33:25.448 --> 06:33:25.458 align:start position:0%
Pittsfield Newport
 
06:33:30.230 --> 06:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
yes yes yes say that again the laws of
 
06:33:30.240 --> 06:33:31.850 align:start position:0%
yes yes yes say that again the laws of
stabilization

06:33:31.850 --> 06:33:31.860 align:start position:0%
stabilization
 
06:33:37.310 --> 06:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
yes yes yes yes yeah and and yeah so the
 
06:33:40.670 --> 06:33:40.680 align:start position:0%
loss of stabilization is about 106 156
 
06:33:43.368 --> 06:33:43.378 align:start position:0%
million dollars to make up for that
 
06:33:45.350 --> 06:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
difference is this
 
06:33:47.990 --> 06:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant which doesn't
 
06:33:50.410 --> 06:33:50.420 align:start position:0%
hit every place that stabilization hit
 
06:33:53.628 --> 06:33:53.638 align:start position:0%
and this hold harmless the whole
 
06:33:55.670 --> 06:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
harmless is now what over 60 million
 
06:33:59.208 --> 06:33:59.218 align:start position:0%
dollars 63 63 million dollars and so
 
06:34:02.270 --> 06:34:02.280 align:start position:0%
that gets you back up to um to
 
06:34:04.910 --> 06:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
essentially back places like Berlin back
 
06:34:09.288 --> 06:34:09.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:12.170 --> 06:34:12.180 align:start position:0%
you know some of the towns which you
 
06:34:14.690 --> 06:34:14.700 align:start position:0%
know some of those towns like a Hanover
 
06:34:18.410 --> 06:34:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:18.420 --> 06:34:20.330 align:start position:0%
 
uh

06:34:20.330 --> 06:34:20.340 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:34:22.970 --> 06:34:22.980 align:start position:0%
so that's that's where we stand on it
 
06:34:26.868 --> 06:34:26.878 align:start position:0%
very increase can't over some of the
 
06:34:26.878 --> 06:34:29.030 align:start position:0%
very increase can't over some of the
um well

06:34:29.030 --> 06:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
um well
 
06:34:29.040 --> 06:34:29.750 align:start position:0%
um well
um

06:34:29.750 --> 06:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:34:31.250 --> 06:34:31.260 align:start position:0%
centipede not so much because they're
 
06:34:34.970 --> 06:34:34.980 align:start position:0%
also a an excess left down but Hanover
 
06:34:37.670 --> 06:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
not being an excess swept home and not
 
06:34:40.010 --> 06:34:40.020 align:start position:0%
be a stabilization tone is going to see
 
06:34:43.070 --> 06:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
an increase due to the increase in base
 
06:34:46.128 --> 06:34:46.138 align:start position:0%
so the the increase in base does not
 
06:34:49.250 --> 06:34:49.260 align:start position:0%
help the property poor communities like
 
06:34:51.230 --> 06:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
Berlin and Claremont and it doesn't help
 
06:34:53.150 --> 06:34:53.160 align:start position:0%
the property rich communities because of
 
06:34:57.530 --> 06:34:57.540 align:start position:0%
the excess Sweat Right yeah so it does a
 
06:34:59.330 --> 06:34:59.340 align:start position:0%
little bit for
 
06:35:02.150 --> 06:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
some folks in the middle
 
06:35:02.160 --> 06:35:06.708 align:start position:0%
some folks in the middle
yeah

06:35:06.708 --> 06:35:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:10.368 --> 06:35:10.378 align:start position:0%
we're not there no but uh
 
06:35:12.770 --> 06:35:12.780 align:start position:0%
the amount of money we're spending right
 
06:35:15.730 --> 06:35:15.740 align:start position:0%
on current law for educations
 
06:35:19.610 --> 06:35:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:24.530 --> 06:35:24.540 align:start position:0%
um the house proposed 1 billion 31
 
06:35:24.540 --> 06:35:26.350 align:start position:0%
um the house proposed 1 billion 31
million

06:35:26.350 --> 06:35:26.360 align:start position:0%
million
 
06:35:29.990 --> 06:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
and the Senate is proposing
 
06:35:33.048 --> 06:35:33.058 align:start position:0%
legally important one
 
06:35:36.830 --> 06:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
for FY 24
 
06:35:36.840 --> 06:35:38.510 align:start position:0%
for FY 24
1

06:35:38.510 --> 06:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
1
 
06:35:42.288 --> 06:35:42.298 align:start position:0%
billion 40 million
 
06:35:45.830 --> 06:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
so they're proposing nine million more
 
06:35:49.730 --> 06:35:49.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:51.770 --> 06:35:51.780 align:start position:0%
didn't they put some of the programs
 
06:35:54.410 --> 06:35:54.420 align:start position:0%
back into the educational Festival
 
06:35:57.770 --> 06:35:57.780 align:start position:0%
yes they they did do that yeah I I do
 
06:35:59.750 --> 06:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
have that here they put most of the
 
06:36:01.310 --> 06:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
programs all back into the education
 
06:36:03.530 --> 06:36:03.540 align:start position:0%
trust fund what they didn't do though is
 
06:36:05.030 --> 06:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
they didn't fund the tuition and
 
06:36:06.948 --> 06:36:06.958 align:start position:0%
transportation for for Career Technical
 
06:36:09.530 --> 06:36:09.540 align:start position:0%
education it's back to nine million
 
06:36:12.170 --> 06:36:12.180 align:start position:0%
dollars per year of the biennium
 
06:36:15.048 --> 06:36:15.058 align:start position:0%
and we'd recommended 11.2 million per by
 
06:36:17.208 --> 06:36:17.218 align:start position:0%
any due to the fact that
 
06:36:19.788 --> 06:36:19.798 align:start position:0%
we see now that we have 10th 11th and
 
06:36:23.990 --> 06:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
12th graders going to ctes Nashua Exeter
 
06:36:26.208 --> 06:36:26.218 align:start position:0%
and Manchester transportation is now
 
06:36:29.330 --> 06:36:29.340 align:start position:0%
covered by two before they they
 
06:36:31.850 --> 06:36:31.860 align:start position:0%
transport inside their own district and
 
06:36:33.770 --> 06:36:33.780 align:start position:0%
if you didn't transfer outside the
 
06:36:35.868 --> 06:36:35.878 align:start position:0%
district you didn't get Transportation
 
06:36:35.878 --> 06:36:36.948 align:start position:0%
district you didn't get Transportation
money

06:36:36.948 --> 06:36:36.958 align:start position:0%
money
 
06:36:39.770 --> 06:36:39.780 align:start position:0%
so with that added in there with the
 
06:36:41.448 --> 06:36:41.458 align:start position:0%
cost those three communities that alone
 
06:36:43.430 --> 06:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
jumps a huge amount
 
06:36:45.350 --> 06:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
but remember the out of that nine
 
06:36:46.788 --> 06:36:46.798 align:start position:0%
million dollars first comes
 
06:36:49.250 --> 06:36:49.260 align:start position:0%
Transportation what's left is then
 
06:36:51.770 --> 06:36:51.780 align:start position:0%
divvied up for tuition reimbursement to
 
06:36:54.708 --> 06:36:54.718 align:start position:0%
the sending District based on 75 percent
 
06:36:58.310 --> 06:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
for the sending for the state and and 25
 
06:37:00.830 --> 06:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
percent of the cost for the local but
 
06:37:02.690 --> 06:37:02.700 align:start position:0%
with more students involved it's going
 
06:37:04.430 --> 06:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
to be less tuition
 
06:37:07.970 --> 06:37:07.980 align:start position:0%
and so there's why we asked for the 2.2
 
06:37:07.980 --> 06:37:09.110 align:start position:0%
and so there's why we asked for the 2.2
additional

06:37:09.110 --> 06:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
additional
 
06:37:14.090 --> 06:37:14.100 align:start position:0%
it was actually voted down rejected due
 
06:37:16.610 --> 06:37:16.620 align:start position:0%
to maintenance of effort maintenance of
 
06:37:18.590 --> 06:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
effort means that once you get to a
 
06:37:21.170 --> 06:37:21.180 align:start position:0%
level of funding you can't go backwards
 
06:37:23.090 --> 06:37:23.100 align:start position:0%
and but that's not the way it's always
 
06:37:25.368 --> 06:37:25.378 align:start position:0%
been done around this joint if going
 
06:37:27.650 --> 06:37:27.660 align:start position:0%
back about six seven eight years ago it
 
06:37:29.208 --> 06:37:29.218 align:start position:0%
used to be five million dollars for
 
06:37:31.010 --> 06:37:31.020 align:start position:0%
Career Technical education we jumped at
 
06:37:32.330 --> 06:37:32.340 align:start position:0%
the nine
 
06:37:35.990 --> 06:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
knowing that due to our population that
 
06:37:37.730 --> 06:37:37.740 align:start position:0%
we have we're trying to get increased
 
06:37:40.730 --> 06:37:40.740 align:start position:0%
CTE population we got apparel that with
 
06:37:43.368 --> 06:37:43.378 align:start position:0%
supporting dollars and
 
06:37:45.948 --> 06:37:45.958 align:start position:0%
we have just decided by way of that
 
06:37:48.350 --> 06:37:48.360 align:start position:0%
Amendment not to do that
 
06:37:50.390 --> 06:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
and that's going to be very difficult
 
06:37:53.690 --> 06:37:53.700 align:start position:0%
for our CTE centers to function the end
 
06:37:56.628 --> 06:37:56.638 align:start position:0%
of it keep current and to get new
 
06:37:58.990 --> 06:37:59.000 align:start position:0%
students yeah
 
06:38:01.970 --> 06:38:01.980 align:start position:0%
and they won't have the seats and some
 
06:38:03.590 --> 06:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
ascending districts aren't sending
 
06:38:04.548 --> 06:38:04.558 align:start position:0%
because they don't get the
 
06:38:06.530 --> 06:38:06.540 align:start position:0%
transportation dollars so what do we
 
06:38:08.810 --> 06:38:08.820 align:start position:0%
need on that Rick to get it to get it to
 
06:38:10.368 --> 06:38:10.378 align:start position:0%
where where it was where I left the
 
06:38:13.070 --> 06:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
house we need another 2.2 million
 
06:38:15.350 --> 06:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
dollars each year of the biennium it's
 
06:38:19.430 --> 06:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
another five so 4.4 yeah 4.4 million
 
06:38:19.440 --> 06:38:20.570 align:start position:0%
another five so 4.4 yeah 4.4 million
dollars

06:38:20.570 --> 06:38:20.580 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
06:38:20.580 --> 06:38:21.650 align:start position:0%
dollars
um

06:38:21.650 --> 06:38:21.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:38:23.810 --> 06:38:23.820 align:start position:0%
I heard from Senator Lang he's going to
 
06:38:25.128 --> 06:38:25.138 align:start position:0%
try to put a floor in them and then
 
06:38:28.250 --> 06:38:28.260 align:start position:0%
supporting that 4.4 yeah yeah however
 
06:38:30.470 --> 06:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
yeah and I mean
 
06:38:32.390 --> 06:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
honestly there's not much difference
 
06:38:36.288 --> 06:38:36.298 align:start position:0%
between one you know 1 billion 31
 
06:38:38.628 --> 06:38:38.638 align:start position:0%
million and 1 billion 40 million when it
 
06:38:42.110 --> 06:38:42.120 align:start position:0%
comes to um adequacy yeah um I mean it
 
06:38:44.628 --> 06:38:44.638 align:start position:0%
it that nine million dollars doesn't do
 
06:38:47.448 --> 06:38:47.458 align:start position:0%
that much you know spread across
 
06:38:49.368 --> 06:38:49.378 align:start position:0%
um and and I think both those numbers
 
06:38:50.810 --> 06:38:50.820 align:start position:0%
the one that passed the house and the
 
06:38:52.310 --> 06:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
one that's being proposed in the Senate
 
06:38:55.490 --> 06:38:55.500 align:start position:0%
are both strong numbers but but you'd
 
06:38:57.410 --> 06:38:57.420 align:start position:0%
probably get more bang for the buck if
 
06:38:59.570 --> 06:38:59.580 align:start position:0%
you took 4.4 out of that and put it
 
06:39:01.730 --> 06:39:01.740 align:start position:0%
towards CTE yeah
 
06:39:04.310 --> 06:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
um you know directed it towards CTE and
 
06:39:07.490 --> 06:39:07.500 align:start position:0%
then looked at a at a at a more
 
06:39:07.500 --> 06:39:08.448 align:start position:0%
then looked at a at a at a more
um

06:39:08.448 --> 06:39:08.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:39:11.990 --> 06:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
in an allocation
 
06:39:14.510 --> 06:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
of adequacy that was more along the
 
06:39:17.208 --> 06:39:17.218 align:start position:0%
lines of the house formula which
 
06:39:18.890 --> 06:39:18.900 align:start position:0%
wouldn't quite be as generous for
 
06:39:21.530 --> 06:39:21.540 align:start position:0%
Manchester and Nashua but it but it
 
06:39:22.970 --> 06:39:22.980 align:start position:0%
would still be generous for Manchester
 
06:39:25.548 --> 06:39:25.558 align:start position:0%
and Nashua but also really help out
 
06:39:27.410 --> 06:39:27.420 align:start position:0%
places like Berlin and Claremont
 
06:39:29.270 --> 06:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
Franklin Pittsfield
 
06:39:30.708 --> 06:39:30.718 align:start position:0%
um that have been taking it on the chin
 
06:39:32.868 --> 06:39:32.878 align:start position:0%
for way two one so
 
06:39:35.868 --> 06:39:35.878 align:start position:0%
the actual cost for the state to send to
 
06:39:40.970 --> 06:39:40.980 align:start position:0%
a CT Senate it's about 680 000. that's
 
06:39:43.368 --> 06:39:43.378 align:start position:0%
funding at 10 cents per mile per pupil
 
06:39:44.810 --> 06:39:44.820 align:start position:0%
that rides the bus
 
06:39:47.628 --> 06:39:47.638 align:start position:0%
which is ridiculous to begin with the
 
06:39:49.610 --> 06:39:49.620 align:start position:0%
the that's not the actual that's what
 
06:39:52.310 --> 06:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
the state pays for the actual cost is
 
06:39:55.490 --> 06:39:55.500 align:start position:0%
2.8 million dollars per year
 
06:39:59.570 --> 06:39:59.580 align:start position:0%
so the the districts is subtract 680 000
 
06:40:01.368 --> 06:40:01.378 align:start position:0%
on the 2.8 you come up pretty close to
 
06:40:01.378 --> 06:40:02.930 align:start position:0%
on the 2.8 you come up pretty close to
2.2

06:40:02.930 --> 06:40:02.940 align:start position:0%
2.2
 
06:40:05.930 --> 06:40:05.940 align:start position:0%
and that's where it's all coming from
 
06:40:08.090 --> 06:40:08.100 align:start position:0%
but right now what that transportation
 
06:40:09.770 --> 06:40:09.780 align:start position:0%
is going to do it's going to take away
 
06:40:11.510 --> 06:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
from tuition
 
06:40:14.208 --> 06:40:14.218 align:start position:0%
and we're just trying to make the same
 
06:40:15.590 --> 06:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
amount of dollar
 
06:40:17.390 --> 06:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
spread out further
 
06:40:20.030 --> 06:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
it's like we do what catastrophic AIDS
 
06:40:20.040 --> 06:40:38.708 align:start position:0%
it's like we do what catastrophic AIDS
sometimes

06:40:38.708 --> 06:40:38.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:42.250 --> 06:40:42.260 align:start position:0%
