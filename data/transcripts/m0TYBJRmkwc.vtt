recommended for future legislation or
 
01:30:01.470 --> 01:30:01.480 align:start position:0%
not recommended for future legislation
 
01:30:03.070 --> 01:30:03.080 align:start position:0%

statement as the committee report such
 
01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
as the committee was unable to reach a

consensus of whether to recommend future
 
01:30:28.590 --> 01:30:28.600 align:start position:0%
legislation or not so that is the advice

01:30:44.709 --> 01:30:44.719 align:start position:0%
refer to interim study and thank you
 
01:30:47.709 --> 01:30:47.719 align:start position:0%
represent Manion for chairing uh both of
 
01:30:50.750 --> 01:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
those efforts uh so at this time uh
 
01:30:52.030 --> 01:30:52.040 align:start position:0%
representative man I'm going to look to
 
01:30:54.430 --> 01:30:54.440 align:start position:0%
you uh to uh
 
01:30:57.629 --> 01:30:57.639 align:start position:0%
to start with the uh HP 1041 the USS
 
01:31:00.270 --> 01:31:00.280 align:start position:0%
Liberty incident and I'm looking for a
 
01:31:01.990 --> 01:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
motion and then sub we'll have
 
01:31:04.709 --> 01:31:04.719 align:start position:0%
subsequent discussion uh I move uh
 
01:31:07.990 --> 01:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
recommend for future legislation
 
01:31:12.070 --> 01:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
second move by representative Manion for
 
01:31:15.830 --> 01:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh favorable future legislation seconded
 
01:31:18.950 --> 01:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
by representative Gagney uh rep Manion
 
01:31:21.629 --> 01:31:21.639 align:start position:0%
uh would you please speak to your motion
 
01:31:23.950 --> 01:31:23.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you Mr chair so uh we
 
01:31:26.669 --> 01:31:26.679 align:start position:0%
went over the bill and we all understood
 
01:31:28.030 --> 01:31:28.040 align:start position:0%
that when the bill when we first put it
 
01:31:29.669 --> 01:31:29.679 align:start position:0%
into the interim study that the bill
 
01:31:31.750 --> 01:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
itself as written had issues especially
 
01:31:33.070 --> 01:31:33.080 align:start position:0%
with like the membership there was
 
01:31:34.149 --> 01:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
people who came here and testified and
 
01:31:35.229 --> 01:31:35.239 align:start position:0%
said they didn't want anything to do
 
01:31:37.149 --> 01:31:37.159 align:start position:0%
with being on the commission so for
 
01:31:38.830 --> 01:31:38.840 align:start position:0%
future legislation one of our
 
01:31:41.189 --> 01:31:41.199 align:start position:0%
suggestions would be that it be scoped
 
01:31:43.350 --> 01:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
down to be like a house committee with a
 
01:31:46.270 --> 01:31:46.280 align:start position:0%
much smaller scope in that respect and
 
01:31:47.350 --> 01:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
uh one of the important things is
 
01:31:49.870 --> 01:31:49.880 align:start position:0%
whatever the outcome of this it needs to
 
01:31:52.430 --> 01:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
be sent the the output report needs to
 
01:31:54.070 --> 01:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
be sent to our federal delegation
 
01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
because they should use this as
 
01:31:57.590 --> 01:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
something that they need to use the
 
01:31:59.870 --> 01:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
powers that they have at their level to
 
01:32:01.790 --> 01:32:01.800 align:start position:0%
investigate further there's only so many
 
01:32:02.830 --> 01:32:02.840 align:start position:0%
things that we're going to be capable of
 
01:32:04.510 --> 01:32:04.520 align:start position:0%
doing as a state we don't have access to
 
01:32:06.470 --> 01:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of this information so whatever we
 
01:32:08.910 --> 01:32:08.920 align:start position:0%
do what whatever testimony we record
 
01:32:11.870 --> 01:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
that should be sent to our federal
 
01:32:13.950 --> 01:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
delegation thank you representative I
 
01:32:15.229 --> 01:32:15.239 align:start position:0%
want to say a couple words about the
 
01:32:16.870 --> 01:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
measure I know there are there are some
 
01:32:18.590 --> 01:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
people who are watching and will'll
 
01:32:22.470 --> 01:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
watch so what this measure had had to do
 
01:32:26.830 --> 01:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
with what it involved D HB 1041 was an
 
01:32:29.310 --> 01:32:29.320 align:start position:0%
incident in the Mediterranean Sea in
 
01:32:33.189 --> 01:32:33.199 align:start position:0%
1967 during the 6 Day War uh between
 
01:32:36.470 --> 01:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
Israel and its uh surrounding uh Arab
 
01:32:40.109 --> 01:32:40.119 align:start position:0%
states and the USS celebrity was a uh
 
01:32:43.270 --> 01:32:43.280 align:start position:0%
American Naval vessel that was attacked
 
01:32:46.830 --> 01:32:46.840 align:start position:0%
by the Israelis and and many uh American
 
01:32:50.430 --> 01:32:50.440 align:start position:0%
Sailors were injured and killed uh the
 
01:32:53.109 --> 01:32:53.119 align:start position:0%
ship was badly damaged and this was uh
 
01:32:54.629 --> 01:32:54.639 align:start position:0%
in 196
 
01:32:57.830 --> 01:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
67 uh Israel subsequently
 
01:33:00.830 --> 01:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
apologized uh but there have have
 
01:33:03.790 --> 01:33:03.800 align:start position:0%
been issues and questions that have
 
01:33:05.750 --> 01:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
lingered obviously we're talking about
 
01:33:09.070 --> 01:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
it here in 2024 in this committee room
 
01:33:10.910 --> 01:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
and so this measure was brought forth by
 
01:33:13.270 --> 01:33:13.280 align:start position:0%
the sponsors and uh you'll all recall
 
01:33:16.229 --> 01:33:16.239 align:start position:0%
there were some survivors of that ship
 
01:33:19.189 --> 01:33:19.199 align:start position:0%
who traveled great distances uh from
 
01:33:23.030 --> 01:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
Missouri and Virginia to come here to
 
01:33:26.149 --> 01:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
speak to the and in their Hope was that
 
01:33:28.830 --> 01:33:28.840 align:start position:0%
uh we would take some sort of action
 
01:33:31.430 --> 01:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
that would more than just shine a light
 
01:33:33.629 --> 01:33:33.639 align:start position:0%
on what happened but uh would be an
 
01:33:37.070 --> 01:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
impetus for for some action um that
 
01:33:39.870 --> 01:33:39.880 align:start position:0%
would be meaningful to uh provide some
 
01:33:42.750 --> 01:33:42.760 align:start position:0%
redress to the survivors and to the
 
01:33:46.750 --> 01:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
memories of those who are uh lost so we
 
01:33:48.189 --> 01:33:48.199 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of time on this in committee
 
01:33:52.550 --> 01:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
as you'll recall and uh we ended up
 
01:33:55.950 --> 01:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
referring it to interim study and uh and
 
01:33:58.830 --> 01:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Manion for your
 
01:34:01.350 --> 01:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
initial comments uh represent Gagner you
 
01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
seconded the motion and I believe you
 
01:34:05.149 --> 01:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
and you also were on the
 
01:34:07.750 --> 01:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh and you also are a Navy
 
01:34:09.750 --> 01:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
man do you do you have some thoughts or
 
01:34:11.950 --> 01:34:11.960 align:start position:0%
some words to the
 
01:34:15.669 --> 01:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
motion I do my bottom line question
 
01:34:18.270 --> 01:34:18.280 align:start position:0%
would be for the federal
 
01:34:22.149 --> 01:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
delegation is why was there a gag order
 
01:34:25.270 --> 01:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
imposed on the crew crew and on the on
 
01:34:27.629 --> 01:34:27.639 align:start position:0%
the Jag officer who investigated this
 
01:34:29.910 --> 01:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
incident why
 
01:34:33.669 --> 01:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
was the people involv those who were
 
01:34:36.270 --> 01:34:36.280 align:start position:0%
wounded and the
 
01:34:38.750 --> 01:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
survivors number one why was that ship
 
01:34:43.790 --> 01:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:46.950 --> 01:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
unescorted I believe this is my opinion
 
01:34:49.590 --> 01:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
I believe that the administration at the
 
01:34:52.510 --> 01:34:52.520 align:start position:0%
time didn't want to start anything U
 
01:34:54.990 --> 01:34:55.000 align:start position:0%
that would lead to
 
01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.510 align:start position:0%
that would lead to
International

01:34:56.510 --> 01:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
International
 
01:34:59.550 --> 01:34:59.560 align:start position:0%
conflict and that's my opinion I am pro-
 
01:35:02.189 --> 01:35:02.199 align:start position:0%
Israel however I know what a flag looks
 
01:35:05.709 --> 01:35:05.719 align:start position:0%
like when it's flying from midships it's
 
01:35:08.910 --> 01:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
big enough to be seen for like a mile
 
01:35:13.950 --> 01:35:13.960 align:start position:0%
away so uh why was that done and why was
 
01:35:19.790 --> 01:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
it my term whitewashed by the uh
 
01:35:25.350 --> 01:35:25.360 align:start position:0%
American uh administration at the time
 
01:35:26.910 --> 01:35:26.920 align:start position:0%
and I'll offer another comment myself
 
01:35:29.590 --> 01:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
and of course everybody here is uh is
 
01:35:33.270 --> 01:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
welcome to weigh in as well I think uh
 
01:35:35.590 --> 01:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
Mo a lot of us are I am a history person
 
01:35:38.950 --> 01:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
many of you are as well and I see value
 
01:35:41.870 --> 01:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
uh in uh shining a light on this
 
01:35:43.709 --> 01:35:43.719 align:start position:0%
important history in this part of the
 
01:35:45.669 --> 01:35:45.679 align:start position:0%
world Israel has been very much
 
01:35:48.070 --> 01:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
prominently in the news uh forever but
 
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
particularly since a year ago October
 
01:35:54.109 --> 01:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
7th and in this a war wars going on
 
01:35:56.149 --> 01:35:56.159 align:start position:0%
there in that part of the world now and
 
01:35:58.550 --> 01:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
and we have people deployed there
 
01:36:01.990 --> 01:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
Americans are in that theater so just
 
01:36:04.070 --> 01:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
the fact that we are talking about this
 
01:36:06.030 --> 01:36:06.040 align:start position:0%
and there are some people listening uh
 
01:36:07.709 --> 01:36:07.719 align:start position:0%
raises awareness about some of the
 
01:36:09.669 --> 01:36:09.679 align:start position:0%
history there some of the military
 
01:36:13.629 --> 01:36:13.639 align:start position:0%
people who uh we lost and uh I think
 
01:36:17.109 --> 01:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
it's important to use this to have us
 
01:36:19.390 --> 01:36:19.400 align:start position:0%
pay more attention to this part of the
 
01:36:22.149 --> 01:36:22.159 align:start position:0%
world that is uh is so important so
 
01:36:24.109 --> 01:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
there are some thoughts from me other
 
01:36:27.350 --> 01:36:27.360 align:start position:0%
thoughts or comments or questions for
 
01:36:30.590 --> 01:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
the uh subcommittee chair representative
 
01:36:32.990 --> 01:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
sherff uh thank you Mr chairman just a
 
01:36:35.590 --> 01:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
question for you representative Manion
 
01:36:37.830 --> 01:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
and that is has any other state passed
 
01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:39.109 align:start position:0%
and that is has any other state passed
this

01:36:39.109 --> 01:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:36:41.830 --> 01:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
legislation not that I'm aware of no
 
01:36:44.629 --> 01:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you the qu that's a
 
01:36:47.550 --> 01:36:47.560 align:start position:0%
good question that's one that I posed uh
 
01:36:49.070 --> 01:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
formally and informally to some of the
 
01:36:51.790 --> 01:36:51.800 align:start position:0%
veterans who came here and we're always
 
01:36:54.189 --> 01:36:54.199 align:start position:0%
interested in what other states do with
 
01:36:57.430 --> 01:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
with things that we're looking at and uh
 
01:36:59.310 --> 01:36:59.320 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge to our knowledge no
 
01:37:01.669 --> 01:37:01.679 align:start position:0%
other state has has taken the action
 
01:37:04.310 --> 01:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
that we've been asked to take here
 
01:37:06.990 --> 01:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
followup Mr chair sure um if this
 
01:37:10.510 --> 01:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
legislation should pass
 
01:37:13.510 --> 01:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
how much could a committee actually do
 
01:37:17.030 --> 01:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't be aering anyone other than
 
01:37:19.709 --> 01:37:19.719 align:start position:0%
maybe hearing some of the Shipmates uh
 
01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
that went through this ordal and my
 
01:37:24.270 --> 01:37:24.280 align:start position:0%
heart is with them as a veteran
 
01:37:27.550 --> 01:37:27.560 align:start position:0%
um and I just worry it be giving them
 
01:37:30.030 --> 01:37:30.040 align:start position:0%
faults feeling that something's finally
 
01:37:33.470 --> 01:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
after 67 years could to be
 
01:37:36.430 --> 01:37:36.440 align:start position:0%
accomplished thank you for that
 
01:37:38.629 --> 01:37:38.639 align:start position:0%
representative if this we're going to
 
01:37:41.030 --> 01:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
vote on it shortly if this were to be
 
01:37:45.709 --> 01:37:45.719 align:start position:0%
recommended for future action then
 
01:37:47.910 --> 01:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
someone depends who's in the mix who
 
01:37:51.830 --> 01:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
gets elected uh it would be up to
 
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
someone an original sponsor or someone
 
01:37:56.390 --> 01:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to the original intent would
 
01:38:01.310 --> 01:38:01.320 align:start position:0%
need to uh uh submit uh an LSR and and
 
01:38:03.990 --> 01:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
the language uh I think would be
 
01:38:05.629 --> 01:38:05.639 align:start position:0%
different I think the language would
 
01:38:07.709 --> 01:38:07.719 align:start position:0%
reflect some of the recommendations we
 
01:38:10.270 --> 01:38:10.280 align:start position:0%
just heard from the subcommittee chair
 
01:38:13.669 --> 01:38:13.679 align:start position:0%
so to your to your good question uh as
 
01:38:17.589 --> 01:38:17.599 align:start position:0%
to where this might go uh it's kind of
 
01:38:19.870 --> 01:38:19.880 align:start position:0%
to be determined it would depend upon
 
01:38:22.350 --> 01:38:22.360 align:start position:0%
who wants to take the time to sponsor it
 
01:38:25.070 --> 01:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
and work up some new langu with with
 
01:38:29.390 --> 01:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
OLS thank you um Mr subcommittee chair
 
01:38:31.910 --> 01:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh you heard the question what do you
 
01:38:34.270 --> 01:38:34.280 align:start position:0%
say to that I think we've also made it
 
01:38:36.350 --> 01:38:36.360 align:start position:0%
very clear as a committee like even when
 
01:38:37.709 --> 01:38:37.719 align:start position:0%
the gentlemen were here testifying
 
01:38:39.550 --> 01:38:39.560 align:start position:0%
before us that there was not much as the
 
01:38:41.270 --> 01:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire we can do like we
 
01:38:42.589 --> 01:38:42.599 align:start position:0%
can what we could do is have them come
 
01:38:44.149 --> 01:38:44.159 align:start position:0%
in testify on the record we'd have it
 
01:38:46.350 --> 01:38:46.360 align:start position:0%
filmed in for posterity it' be on the
 
01:38:47.830 --> 01:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
internet forever and we can send those
 
01:38:49.109 --> 01:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
things to the federal delegation where
 
01:38:51.109 --> 01:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
they would have much more resources they
 
01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
can call upon they can issue subpoenas
 
01:38:54.750 --> 01:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
and get the information that they're
 
01:38:56.910 --> 01:38:56.920 align:start position:0%
looking for but it's it's kind of like
 
01:38:58.629 --> 01:38:58.639 align:start position:0%
um those guys have been going around and
 
01:38:59.870 --> 01:38:59.880 align:start position:0%
and we're like the first state to
 
01:39:01.189 --> 01:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
actually take them seriously what
 
01:39:03.149 --> 01:39:03.159 align:start position:0%
they've been doing for like decades now
 
01:39:04.870 --> 01:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
is just they go on podcasts wherever
 
01:39:06.109 --> 01:39:06.119 align:start position:0%
they can try to get their message out
 
01:39:07.709 --> 01:39:07.719 align:start position:0%
there but that's like the limitation
 
01:39:09.550 --> 01:39:09.560 align:start position:0%
this is like a level up from that I
 
01:39:11.030 --> 01:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
think and it's showing them more respect
 
01:39:12.870 --> 01:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
than just relegating them to like the
 
01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:15.589 align:start position:0%
than just relegating them to like the
podcast

01:39:15.589 --> 01:39:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:17.750 --> 01:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
sphere and that's a comment that I made
 
01:39:19.550 --> 01:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
to them when they were here I said uh
 
01:39:21.709 --> 01:39:21.719 align:start position:0%
we're listening to you uh this is New
 
01:39:24.550 --> 01:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire every Bill gets a hearing and
 
01:39:26.390 --> 01:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
you need to know as you heard me tell
 
01:39:29.270 --> 01:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
them uh as represent Manning just said
 
01:39:31.990 --> 01:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh you're being heard and in perpetuity
 
01:39:34.270 --> 01:39:34.280 align:start position:0%
the uh the recording the YouTube is out
 
01:39:35.550 --> 01:39:35.560 align:start position:0%
there I'm sure they've looked at it and
 
01:39:38.790 --> 01:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
shared it and that's uh if nothing else
 
01:39:40.950 --> 01:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
that they've their voice has been given
 
01:39:43.629 --> 01:39:43.639 align:start position:0%
um has been heard any other uh comments
 
01:39:47.589 --> 01:39:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:50.910 --> 01:39:50.920 align:start position:0%
Rollins thank you Mr chairman my feeling
 
01:39:53.030 --> 01:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
is that we owe all these men on this
 
01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:54.229 align:start position:0%
is that we owe all these men on this
ship

01:39:54.229 --> 01:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
ship
 
01:39:56.430 --> 01:39:56.440 align:start position:0%
an answer to what happened that day so
 
01:39:58.830 --> 01:39:58.840 align:start position:0%
that they know so that these men can
 
01:40:01.149 --> 01:40:01.159 align:start position:0%
have finally have closure after all
 
01:40:03.310 --> 01:40:03.320 align:start position:0%
these years that's all I have to say
 
01:40:05.550 --> 01:40:05.560 align:start position:0%
they they do they need
 
01:40:07.950 --> 01:40:07.960 align:start position:0%
closure thank you representative
 
01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:09.950 align:start position:0%
closure thank you representative
anything

01:40:09.950 --> 01:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:40:13.390 --> 01:40:13.400 align:start position:0%
else seeing No Hands Madam clerk I do I
 
01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
do I'm sorry cber your red light is on
 
01:40:20.350 --> 01:40:20.360 align:start position:0%
yes yeah okay all right um no I just um
 
01:40:22.070 --> 01:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
it seems like also something we could
 
01:40:25.310 --> 01:40:25.320 align:start position:0%
have already done like send them the the
 
01:40:27.830 --> 01:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
recording we already have right to our
 
01:40:30.510 --> 01:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
federal delegation and ask them these
 
01:40:35.189 --> 01:40:35.199 align:start position:0%
questions just a thought also you know
 
01:40:36.990 --> 01:40:37.000 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you representative so I don't
 
01:40:39.589 --> 01:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
know that we have specifically because
 
01:40:41.790 --> 01:40:41.800 align:start position:0%
we haven't finalized action on this
 
01:40:44.149 --> 01:40:44.159 align:start position:0%
measure we haven't um sent anything
 
01:40:47.990 --> 01:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
formally to the to the de delegation but
 
01:40:52.310 --> 01:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh I think that uh once we vote on this
 
01:40:55.070 --> 01:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
I think would be appropriate to to uh
 
01:40:57.589 --> 01:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
share the results of the vote and on
 
01:41:02.109 --> 01:41:02.119 align:start position:0%
this um to that delegation and
 
01:41:06.149 --> 01:41:06.159 align:start position:0%
elsewhere is that okay yeah I guess yeah
 
01:41:08.669 --> 01:41:08.679 align:start position:0%
I just I feel bad telling them we can do
 
01:41:10.870 --> 01:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
something we can't do and then have to
 
01:41:12.790 --> 01:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
have them come back and testify again I
 
01:41:14.109 --> 01:41:14.119 align:start position:0%
mean they were already thankful to have
 
01:41:16.149 --> 01:41:16.159 align:start position:0%
been here once you know and I know the
 
01:41:18.149 --> 01:41:18.159 align:start position:0%
trip isn't cheap and all that and it's
 
01:41:20.470 --> 01:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
like it seems like we could have already
 
01:41:23.430 --> 01:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
done that you know um versus but you
 
01:41:26.510 --> 01:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
know I get it yeah
 
01:41:29.669 --> 01:41:29.679 align:start position:0%
okay yes I I I hear you I agree I you
 
01:41:31.669 --> 01:41:31.679 align:start position:0%
can tell I we're all sympathetic to
 
01:41:34.070 --> 01:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
these survivors and and and and what
 
01:41:36.709 --> 01:41:36.719 align:start position:0%
they're trying to accomplish thank you
 
01:41:39.030 --> 01:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
for that representative Milla I just
 
01:41:40.990 --> 01:41:41.000 align:start position:0%
think it's important that they realize
 
01:41:43.390 --> 01:41:43.400 align:start position:0%
we're Limited in what we can do but
 
01:41:46.990 --> 01:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to do as much as we can yeah
 
01:41:49.589 --> 01:41:49.599 align:start position:0%
agree and I think we convey that to them
 
01:41:52.149 --> 01:41:52.159 align:start position:0%
and I know they appreciated that uh
 
01:41:54.390 --> 01:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
there were some people that were
 
01:41:56.629 --> 01:41:56.639 align:start position:0%
listening and and trying to take some
 
01:41:59.870 --> 01:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
sort of action other comments questions
 
01:42:02.830 --> 01:42:02.840 align:start position:0%
anything representative L good job
 
01:42:04.750 --> 01:42:04.760 align:start position:0%
representative Manning on that with the
 
01:42:06.629 --> 01:42:06.639 align:start position:0%
interim study and getting it this far
 
01:42:10.229 --> 01:42:10.239 align:start position:0%
because I think a lot of these veterans
 
01:42:13.709 --> 01:42:13.719 align:start position:0%
really do need to get closure on this
 
01:42:16.229 --> 01:42:16.239 align:start position:0%
because it's very important to them so
 
01:42:18.189 --> 01:42:18.199 align:start position:0%
great job R
 
01:42:22.030 --> 01:42:22.040 align:start position:0%

thank you uh M or S uh thank you um it's
 
01:42:35.390 --> 01:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
been a while uh so I I I just wanted to
 
01:42:37.910 --> 01:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
go on record as saying um I believe that
 
01:42:40.629 --> 01:42:40.639 align:start position:0%
everybody has the ability to appeal a
 
01:42:42.430 --> 01:42:42.440 align:start position:0%
decision that they don't feel was
 
01:42:46.149 --> 01:42:46.159 align:start position:0%
investigated fully and extensively and
 
01:42:49.550 --> 01:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
um I also uh just wanted to say that I
 
01:42:52.229 --> 01:42:52.239 align:start position:0%
fully you know appreciate those veterans
 
01:42:54.070 --> 01:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
who did come out here and I do feel like
 
01:42:55.910 --> 01:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
they need their closure I would
 
01:42:58.350 --> 01:42:58.360 align:start position:0%
recommend that if this moved forward in
 
01:43:01.550 --> 01:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
any type of legislation that the that we
 
01:43:04.390 --> 01:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
keep in mind the our limited ability as
 
01:43:07.310 --> 01:43:07.320 align:start position:0%
well um as has already been stated um in
 
01:43:09.830 --> 01:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
that we don't have the jurisdiction to
 
01:43:13.070 --> 01:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
investigate this all we can really do is
 
01:43:15.229 --> 01:43:15.239 align:start position:0%
recommend that others investigate it
 
01:43:18.830 --> 01:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
with their capability um but that that's
 
01:43:20.109 --> 01:43:20.119 align:start position:0%

01:45:54.950 --> 01:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
future
 
01:45:57.430 --> 01:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
legislation do I have a
 
01:46:01.070 --> 01:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
second second again uh representative
 
01:46:04.790 --> 01:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
gagy seconds the uh motion of the
 
01:46:06.950 --> 01:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee chair ranion would you
 
01:46:08.629 --> 01:46:08.639 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion yes absolutely
 
01:46:11.350 --> 01:46:11.360 align:start position:0%
thank you um so there is currently a
 
01:46:12.669 --> 01:46:12.679 align:start position:0%
committee that is studying the New
 
01:46:15.310 --> 01:46:15.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire response to this uh the bill I
 
01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
spoke to the bill uh Prime on this one
 
01:46:19.870 --> 01:46:19.880 align:start position:0%
and his explanation makes sense to me it
 
01:46:23.149 --> 01:46:23.159 align:start position:0%
was more this is more about the much
 
01:46:25.750 --> 01:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
larger scope of uh the circumstances so
 
01:46:27.470 --> 01:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
it would be like uh the influence from
 
01:46:29.390 --> 01:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
the federal government uh the efficacy
 
01:46:32.390 --> 01:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
of op operation warp speed uh any of the
 
01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
um non-governmental organizations that
 
01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
may have had influence within the state
 
01:46:37.709 --> 01:46:37.719 align:start position:0%
whether it be through the state itself
 
01:46:40.070 --> 01:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
through a um through the towns whatever
 
01:46:42.950 --> 01:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
like directly circumventing the state um
 
01:46:45.470 --> 01:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
I I think it's a we decided that it
 
01:46:47.830 --> 01:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
would be worth investigating once again
 
01:46:49.390 --> 01:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
we're kind of at the limitation where we
 
01:46:50.830 --> 01:46:50.840 align:start position:0%
can't get all the information we may
 
01:46:52.229 --> 01:46:52.239 align:start position:0%
want from the federal government but
 
01:46:53.390 --> 01:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
it's something that we could definitely
 
01:46:55.390 --> 01:46:55.400 align:start position:0%
like ask the towns and and things of
 
01:46:56.950 --> 01:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
those like was there anything not from
 
01:46:58.430 --> 01:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire state but perhaps from
 
01:46:59.830 --> 01:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
the federal government or non-government
 
01:47:01.629 --> 01:47:01.639 align:start position:0%
organizations that may have influenced
 
01:47:03.510 --> 01:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
your decisions uh that you made at at
 
01:47:04.910 --> 01:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
the local
 
01:47:07.830 --> 01:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
level Rose Manion what was the vote was
 
01:47:10.149 --> 01:47:10.159 align:start position:0%
it a unanimous vote unanimous 40 both of
 
01:47:12.470 --> 01:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
these were 40 okay that's what I thought
 
01:47:14.910 --> 01:47:14.920 align:start position:0%
we had represent gagy you seconded this
 
01:47:17.189 --> 01:47:17.199 align:start position:0%
do you want toh speak to your
 
01:47:20.870 --> 01:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
second no I think the subcommittee chair
 
01:47:23.430 --> 01:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
spoke eloquently enough uh
 
01:47:25.229 --> 01:47:25.239 align:start position:0%
and I back him
 
01:47:27.510 --> 01:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
up thank you representative gagy and
 
01:47:29.350 --> 01:47:29.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for your eloquence uh uh
 
01:47:31.589 --> 01:47:31.599 align:start position:0%
representative Manion uh questions
 
01:47:33.950 --> 01:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
thoughts comments from from anyone
 
01:47:36.910 --> 01:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
represent cber yeah so I watched some of
 
01:47:38.510 --> 01:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
the videos from the current committee
 
01:47:42.149 --> 01:47:42.159 align:start position:0%
that is taking place and I actually um
 
01:47:43.589 --> 01:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
believe they're getting very good
 
01:47:45.870 --> 01:47:45.880 align:start position:0%
information actually that needed to be
 
01:47:48.030 --> 01:47:48.040 align:start position:0%
addressed definitely um it turns out
 
01:47:51.149 --> 01:47:51.159 align:start position:0%
like our state only had you know really
 
01:47:52.870 --> 01:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
old plans for like hurricane resp
 
01:47:55.589 --> 01:47:55.599 align:start position:0%
response is what they just referred to
 
01:47:57.550 --> 01:47:57.560 align:start position:0%
and so there were obviously like gaps in
 
01:48:01.070 --> 01:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
the system that needed to be dealt with
 
01:48:02.550 --> 01:48:02.560 align:start position:0%
that type of thing just things need to
 
01:48:04.669 --> 01:48:04.679 align:start position:0%
be updated and obviously the world has
 
01:48:07.990 --> 01:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
updated since then so um I believe that
 
01:48:09.790 --> 01:48:09.800 align:start position:0%
stuff is really good information and
 
01:48:12.950 --> 01:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
that type of thing we need Solutions we
 
01:48:15.390 --> 01:48:15.400 align:start position:0%
need to seek in the future for future
 
01:48:17.669 --> 01:48:17.679 align:start position:0%
legislation I'm not sure how much we
 
01:48:19.750 --> 01:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
need to really get into the weeds and
 
01:48:22.750 --> 01:48:22.760 align:start position:0%
how much ends up being just a EXP
 
01:48:25.109 --> 01:48:25.119 align:start position:0%
exporing conspiracies and seeing which
 
01:48:28.270 --> 01:48:28.280 align:start position:0%
things fit our narrative at any given
 
01:48:31.030 --> 01:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
time it seems like a lot that can go
 
01:48:33.189 --> 01:48:33.199 align:start position:0%
into a lot of different directions as we
 
01:48:35.030 --> 01:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
saw when we had
 
01:48:37.950 --> 01:48:37.960 align:start position:0%
testimony and so while opinions are
 
01:48:40.910 --> 01:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
important I also think that we really
 
01:48:43.310 --> 01:48:43.320 align:start position:0%
need to directly do what can immediately
 
01:48:45.510 --> 01:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
affect our citizens and really help them
 
01:48:48.350 --> 01:48:48.360 align:start position:0%
out if there's a natural disaster or
 
01:48:50.229 --> 01:48:50.239 align:start position:0%
anything else that can happen you know
 
01:48:52.950 --> 01:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
within that time frame I I see that
 
01:48:57.189 --> 01:48:57.199 align:start position:0%
getting done first so thank you thank
 
01:48:59.109 --> 01:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
you for that in my understanding is the
 
01:49:03.070 --> 01:49:03.080 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor if he is reelected uh is
 
01:49:06.070 --> 01:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
interested in taking the your work and
 
01:49:08.990 --> 01:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
your recommendations and and U putting
 
01:49:12.550 --> 01:49:12.560 align:start position:0%
something together uh for the next term
 
01:49:19.350 --> 01:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:24.470 --> 01:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
questions seeing No Hands then let us uh
 
01:49:27.270 --> 01:49:27.280 align:start position:0%

01:49:30.030 --> 01:49:30.040 align:start position:0%

01:49:36.910 --> 01:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:39.430 --> 01:49:39.440 align:start position:0%

committee um I really appreciate it I

over 20 measures not quite what
 
01:50:54.629 --> 01:50:54.639 align:start position:0%
education deals with but uh we had a
 
01:50:56.589 --> 01:50:56.599 align:start position:0%
decent load and and obviously we spent a
 
01:50:58.870 --> 01:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
lot of time on some of these and with a
 
01:51:02.030 --> 01:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
lot of uh a lot of testimony from many
 
01:51:04.470 --> 01:51:04.480 align:start position:0%

01:51:06.910 --> 01:51:06.920 align:start position:0%
honored the sponsors and those who cared
 
01:51:08.629 --> 01:51:08.639 align:start position:0%

very helpful role in this committee and
 
01:52:08.589 --> 01:52:08.599 align:start position:0%
and for all your previous work um I'll
 
01:52:12.990 --> 01:52:13.000 align:start position:0%
say uh 20 years ago 2004 when I was a
 
01:52:16.870 --> 01:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
young man um there was another young man
 
01:52:20.990 --> 01:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh I ran for rep uh out of conquer that
 
01:52:23.629 --> 01:52:23.639 align:start position:0%
year uh and and I noticed uh of course
 
01:52:25.310 --> 01:52:25.320 align:start position:0%
you notice the other people that are
 
01:52:26.709 --> 01:52:26.719 align:start position:0%
running and I noticed some of the other
 
01:52:28.149 --> 01:52:28.159 align:start position:0%
names one of the other names that was
 
01:52:29.709 --> 01:52:29.719 align:start position:0%
running in conquered was representative
 
01:52:31.390 --> 01:52:31.400 align:start position:0%
schliff was first time I'd heard his
 
01:52:34.149 --> 01:52:34.159 align:start position:0%
name and he was in a different district
 
01:52:37.470 --> 01:52:37.480 align:start position:0%
and um and he was successful he won uh
 
01:52:39.629 --> 01:52:39.639 align:start position:0%
and I think that was if if my Math's
 
01:52:42.950 --> 01:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
right that's the first of 10 consecutive
 
01:52:45.990 --> 01:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh uh election victories for the
 
01:52:48.390 --> 01:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
representative from from Penacook uh I
 
01:52:51.589 --> 01:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
lost and it took me TW took me 12 years
 
01:52:55.030 --> 01:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
to uh to get here I always wanted to be
 
01:52:57.870 --> 01:52:57.880 align:start position:0%
here and 12 years later I I got here now
 
01:53:01.750 --> 01:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
I am wielding a gavel and speaking um
 
01:53:03.550 --> 01:53:03.560 align:start position:0%
about representative Sherl so that's all
 
01:53:06.589 --> 01:53:06.599 align:start position:0%

01:55:54.069 --> 01:55:54.079 align:start position:0%
academy was very intense wasn't it six
 
01:55:57.109 --> 01:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
weeks yeah we did more listening than
 
01:56:00.270 --> 01:56:00.280 align:start position:0%
anything else right Sergeant Sandler was
 
01:56:04.669 --> 01:56:04.679 align:start position:0%

01:56:21.149 --> 01:56:21.159 align:start position:0%
chair of Criminal Justice and I was I
 
01:56:23.149 --> 01:56:23.159 align:start position:0%

01:56:33.550 --> 01:56:33.560 align:start position:0%
apart I remember looking at him and I
 
01:56:36.830 --> 01:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
remember talking to you and I remember
 
01:56:39.550 --> 01:56:39.560 align:start position:0%
telling you that I've got one mouth and
 
01:56:42.629 --> 01:56:42.639 align:start position:0%
two ears so this term I want to listen
 
01:56:46.270 --> 01:56:46.280 align:start position:0%
way more than talk and you says that's
 
01:56:50.910 --> 01:56:50.920 align:start position:0%
very wise it was very wise so in in in
 
01:56:53.709 --> 01:56:53.719 align:start position:0%
conversation we uh we found out that we
 
01:56:55.550 --> 01:56:55.560 align:start position:0%
we had graduated you didn't have a
 
01:56:57.790 --> 01:56:57.800 align:start position:0%

01:57:00.270 --> 01:57:00.280 align:start position:0%
you and you asked me could make a copy
 
01:57:01.790 --> 01:57:01.800 align:start position:0%

01:57:04.310 --> 01:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
they're two going down it it was it was
 
01:57:07.430 --> 01:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
pretty cool going back somewhat now you
 
01:57:10.750 --> 01:57:10.760 align:start position:0%
and I have both had flashbacks from
 
01:57:14.069 --> 01:57:14.079 align:start position:0%
various events you in Vietnam me as a
 
01:57:15.390 --> 01:57:15.400 align:start position:0%
police officer in
 
01:57:18.430 --> 01:57:18.440 align:start position:0%
Manchester and I I remember you and I
 
01:57:20.189 --> 01:57:20.199 align:start position:0%
talked about that without going into any
 
01:57:21.990 --> 01:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
detail we were able to help each other
 
01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:23.229 align:start position:0%
detail we were able to help each other
out

01:57:23.229 --> 01:57:23.239 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:57:26.229 --> 01:57:26.239 align:start position:0%
uh what else do I have to tell tell you
 
01:57:28.510 --> 01:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
I really really nothing else it's been a
 
01:57:31.629 --> 01:57:31.639 align:start position:0%
pleasure serving with you uh I remember
 
01:57:33.430 --> 01:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
I used to be able when you were chair
 
01:57:35.669 --> 01:57:35.679 align:start position:0%
when you were a speaker I was able to
 
01:57:38.510 --> 01:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
take my grandkids up to the office and
 
01:57:41.790 --> 01:57:41.800 align:start position:0%
we had a conversation we may not have
 
01:57:45.270 --> 01:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
agreed uh politically all that much
 
01:57:48.870 --> 01:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
however we both love this country and we
 
01:57:51.189 --> 01:57:51.199 align:start position:0%
we' probably do it again wouldn't we I
 
01:57:54.629 --> 01:57:54.639 align:start position:0%
think I think so too so I I was not a
 
01:57:56.430 --> 01:57:56.440 align:start position:0%
Ground Pounder which is why I joined the
 
01:57:58.870 --> 01:57:58.880 align:start position:0%

01:58:00.589 --> 01:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
didn't want to crawl through mud and I
 
01:58:02.390 --> 01:58:02.400 align:start position:0%

bills nobody would talk about him the
 
01:58:41.149 --> 01:58:41.159 align:start position:0%
first hand going up that's we' recognize
 
01:58:43.830 --> 01:58:43.840 align:start position:0%

200 that's right represent G he was and

is a wrestler I don't think he wrestles
 
01:59:40.470 --> 01:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
as much as he did I have two more I have
 
01:59:43.350 --> 01:59:43.360 align:start position:0%
two more pink cards uh uh representative
 
01:59:46.270 --> 01:59:46.280 align:start position:0%
Carrie uh who right to my left submitted
 
01:59:49.550 --> 01:59:49.560 align:start position:0%
a pink card and uh representative carrye
 
01:59:52.990 --> 01:59:53.000 align:start position:0%
is representative Cary is going to to
 
02:00:01.950 --> 02:00:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:05.390 --> 02:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
chair or maybe not represent Carrie is
 
02:00:07.390 --> 02:00:07.400 align:start position:0%
left the left the
 
02:00:07.400 --> 02:00:09.589 align:start position:0%
left the left the
room

02:00:09.589 --> 02:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
room
 
02:00:19.110 --> 02:00:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:19.120 --> 02:00:24.830 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

02:00:24.830 --> 02:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:27.470 --> 02:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
so uh representative shirtliff I met
 
02:00:30.830 --> 02:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
many years ago um when he was playing
 
02:00:33.350 --> 02:00:33.360 align:start position:0%
Santa Claus and my children who were
 
02:00:36.430 --> 02:00:36.440 align:start position:0%
toddlers at the time uh were so thrilled
 
02:00:38.950 --> 02:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
to meet Santa Claus uh he was
 
02:00:41.550 --> 02:00:41.560 align:start position:0%
volunteering for a nonprofit in Penacook
 
02:00:44.390 --> 02:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
the Penacook historical society and
 
02:00:46.350 --> 02:00:46.360 align:start position:0%
little did I know that our paths would
 
02:00:49.109 --> 02:00:49.119 align:start position:0%
meet again in the State House more than
 
02:00:52.870 --> 02:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
once um but as I thought of his service
 
02:00:56.030 --> 02:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
not only to his community but to our
 
02:01:01.149 --> 02:01:01.159 align:start position:0%
state I could think of only one symbol
 
02:01:03.870 --> 02:01:03.880 align:start position:0%
of his service that would be appropriate
 
02:01:05.470 --> 02:01:05.480 align:start position:0%
it would have to be something made in
 
02:01:07.629 --> 02:01:07.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and it would have to be
 
02:01:10.350 --> 02:01:10.360 align:start position:0%
something involving the state house and
 
02:01:14.390 --> 02:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
so this was made by local artists Diane

in here to know there's nothing mean
 
02:03:58.549 --> 02:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
there's nothing vicious about what I'm
 
02:04:00.990 --> 02:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
saying going to say it's just all about
 
02:04:03.109 --> 02:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
two guys that came together that became
 
02:04:05.229 --> 02:04:05.239 align:start position:0%
very good friends that love to rib each
 
02:04:07.830 --> 02:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
other every time we get
 
02:04:10.069 --> 02:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
together let make sure I start in the
 
02:04:12.310 --> 02:04:12.320 align:start position:0%
beginning just got my
 
02:04:15.470 --> 02:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
highlights when I was when I first
 
02:04:19.430 --> 02:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
became uh the term was as coach him and
 
02:04:21.950 --> 02:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
one of my jobs was to do the seating AR
 
02:04:23.990 --> 02:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
Arrangement and so when I did the
 
02:04:26.390 --> 02:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
seating arrangement I put Steve being
 
02:04:28.470 --> 02:04:28.480 align:start position:0%
beside of me as a high ranking the
 
02:04:31.109 --> 02:04:31.119 align:start position:0%
highest ranking Democrat member halfway
 
02:04:33.430 --> 02:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
through the session I turned around and
 
02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
looked at him and I said the real reason
 
02:04:36.669 --> 02:04:36.679 align:start position:0%
I put you beside of me is so I could
 
02:04:39.510 --> 02:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
keep an eye on you but I said I've
 
02:04:41.549 --> 02:04:41.559 align:start position:0%
learned real fast that I really messed
 
02:04:42.910 --> 02:04:42.920 align:start position:0%
that up because you're the one keeping
 
02:04:45.030 --> 02:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
an eye on
 
02:04:48.549 --> 02:04:48.559 align:start position:0%
me and uh let me get down the line
 
02:04:51.750 --> 02:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
here another time uh Steve was sitting
 
02:04:54.030 --> 02:04:54.040 align:start position:0%
here before session Linda Miller comes
 
02:04:56.390 --> 02:04:56.400 align:start position:0%

now she goes what for I go he's famous
 
02:05:05.350 --> 02:05:05.360 align:start position:0%

02:05:11.109 --> 02:05:11.119 align:start position:0%

02:09:16.030 --> 02:09:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:19.589 --> 02:09:19.599 align:start position:0%
apparently thank you Mr chair um this is
 
02:09:23.669 --> 02:09:23.679 align:start position:0%
just sort of an illustration of Steve's
 
02:09:27.629 --> 02:09:27.639 align:start position:0%
generosity um I was uncharacteristically
 
02:09:31.589 --> 02:09:31.599 align:start position:0%
late for session one day and um I
 
02:09:34.669 --> 02:09:34.679 align:start position:0%
realize as I'm looking in my abyss of my
 
02:09:38.069 --> 02:09:38.079 align:start position:0%
pocketbook that I don't have my glasses
 
02:09:39.669 --> 02:09:39.679 align:start position:0%
well everybody knows if you don't have
 
02:09:41.870 --> 02:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
your glasses that also affects your
 
02:09:45.470 --> 02:09:45.480 align:start position:0%
hearing so I after looking for a while
 
02:09:49.790 --> 02:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
and sighing a lot and arm length reading
 
02:09:51.830 --> 02:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
my um notes
 
02:09:56.709 --> 02:09:56.719 align:start position:0%
and then pulling my seatmates for spare
 
02:10:00.109 --> 02:10:00.119 align:start position:0%
glasses um lunch break came along
 
02:10:03.270 --> 02:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
mercifully for everybody in my
 
02:10:07.830 --> 02:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
section so after lunch was over um I
 
02:10:10.510 --> 02:10:10.520 align:start position:0%
came back into the chamber and Steve
 
02:10:12.510 --> 02:10:12.520 align:start position:0%
sitting there with a paper
 
02:10:17.149 --> 02:10:17.159 align:start position:0%
bag and in the paper bag there was a
 
02:10:20.629 --> 02:10:20.639 align:start position:0%
pair of glasses he had gone down to R
 
02:10:23.750 --> 02:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
Aid and and picked up a pair of glasses
 
02:10:26.149 --> 02:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
and although the glasses didn't really
 
02:10:30.030 --> 02:10:30.040 align:start position:0%
set a fashion trend they definitely were
 
02:10:34.910 --> 02:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
you useful for me and also he saved his
 
02:10:37.950 --> 02:10:37.960 align:start position:0%
seatmate sanity because I didn't have to
 
02:10:41.069 --> 02:10:41.079 align:start position:0%

serving a single year in the house Steve
 
02:12:34.589 --> 02:12:34.599 align:start position:0%

chair of the House labor committee I
 
02:12:40.750 --> 02:12:40.760 align:start position:0%

02:14:26.750 --> 02:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
for the last six years when Steve was

speaker uh I used to meet with him once
 
02:14:29.159 --> 02:14:29.950 align:start position:0%
speaker uh I used to meet with him once
a

02:14:29.950 --> 02:14:29.960 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:14:33.189 --> 02:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
week um you know to go over what was
 
02:14:35.470 --> 02:14:35.480 align:start position:0%
happening that's when I was in the uh
 
02:14:38.950 --> 02:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
minority office and Steve and I had some
 
02:14:40.790 --> 02:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
terrific conversations because we both
 
02:14:44.750 --> 02:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
love history and um we had some terrific
 
02:14:48.510 --> 02:14:48.520 align:start position:0%
conversations about historical
 
02:14:51.430 --> 02:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
figures and uh I'm going to miss those
 
02:14:51.440 --> 02:14:52.149 align:start position:0%
figures and uh I'm going to miss those
my

02:14:52.149 --> 02:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
my
 
02:14:52.159 --> 02:14:56.149 align:start position:0%
my
friend

02:14:59.109 --> 02:14:59.119 align:start position:0%
um the relationship I think that Steve
 
02:15:00.470 --> 02:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
and I have
 
02:15:03.709 --> 02:15:03.719 align:start position:0%
proves that you can disagree
 
02:15:06.990 --> 02:15:07.000 align:start position:0%
on different subjects You can disagree
 
02:15:09.790 --> 02:15:09.800 align:start position:0%
on philosophy but you can still be good
 
02:15:12.030 --> 02:15:12.040 align:start position:0%
friends and I think that's what Steve
 
02:15:14.669 --> 02:15:14.679 align:start position:0%
and I have been for the whole time that
 
02:15:18.790 --> 02:15:18.800 align:start position:0%

um you can put the rhetoric side and you
 
02:15:25.470 --> 02:15:25.480 align:start position:0%
can truly disagree philosophically
 
02:15:27.430 --> 02:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
without being
 
02:15:30.870 --> 02:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
disagreeable and for the past four years

give him a call and I said want to come
 
02:15:39.189 --> 02:15:39.199 align:start position:0%

limits uh two to three minutes and uh
 
02:19:45.429 --> 02:19:45.439 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to go there yet um because
 
02:19:47.870 --> 02:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
the next speaker I think uh also rates
 
02:19:50.710 --> 02:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
uh uh some whatever flexibility he
 
02:19:53.349 --> 02:19:53.359 align:start position:0%
desires another speaker a former speaker
 
02:19:55.910 --> 02:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh former speaker Sean Jasper is in the
 
02:20:03.349 --> 02:20:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:05.670 --> 02:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
speaker thank you Mr
 
02:20:09.510 --> 02:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
chairman representative shirtliff former
 
02:20:13.309 --> 02:20:13.319 align:start position:0%
speaker schliff I I really have to Echo
 
02:20:15.349 --> 02:20:15.359 align:start position:0%
almost all of the comments that uh
 
02:20:17.590 --> 02:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
speaker Packard made you and I had a
 
02:20:18.990 --> 02:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
very similar
 
02:20:21.190 --> 02:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
relationship um when I was speaker and
 
02:20:22.830 --> 02:20:22.840 align:start position:0%
you were minority
 
02:20:26.469 --> 02:20:26.479 align:start position:0%
leader but it goes well beyond that and
 
02:20:29.429 --> 02:20:29.439 align:start position:0%
I'll go back uh just about 10
 
02:20:31.830 --> 02:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
years and I think we all know what
 
02:20:34.870 --> 02:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
happened in December of
 
02:20:37.590 --> 02:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
2014 uh and if you don't you can ask
 
02:20:42.710 --> 02:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
somebody but I always have uh plan a and
 
02:20:42.720 --> 02:20:43.590 align:start position:0%
somebody but I always have uh plan a and
plan

02:20:43.590 --> 02:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
plan
 
02:20:46.469 --> 02:20:46.479 align:start position:0%
B and so when I was running for speaker
 
02:20:49.190 --> 02:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
plan a was to
 
02:20:52.510 --> 02:20:52.520 align:start position:0%
lose Plan B was to win and wasn't a very
 
02:20:52.520 --> 02:20:54.150 align:start position:0%
lose Plan B was to win and wasn't a very
well-developed

02:20:54.150 --> 02:20:54.160 align:start position:0%
well-developed
 
02:20:58.349 --> 02:20:58.359 align:start position:0%
plan but a very intrical part of my
 
02:21:01.870 --> 02:21:01.880 align:start position:0%
becoming speaker was representative
 
02:21:05.230 --> 02:21:05.240 align:start position:0%
shirtliffe who showed something that far
 
02:21:07.710 --> 02:21:07.720 align:start position:0%
too few politicians in this country and
 
02:21:09.590 --> 02:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
I've thought of this a lot when we've
 
02:21:11.349 --> 02:21:11.359 align:start position:0%
seen what happened with the speaker's
 
02:21:16.070 --> 02:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
race in Washington uh several times now
 
02:21:18.110 --> 02:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
that Steve schliff
 
02:21:20.710 --> 02:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
put politics
 
02:21:24.950 --> 02:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
well below what he saw and I believed as
 
02:21:27.110 --> 02:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
well was best not only for the New
 
02:21:28.870 --> 02:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislature but for the people
 
02:21:32.469 --> 02:21:32.479 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and he rallied his
 
02:21:35.790 --> 02:21:35.800 align:start position:0%
caucus um to support me and he didn't
 
02:21:38.870 --> 02:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
ask for anything in return other than
 
02:21:41.950 --> 02:21:41.960 align:start position:0%
that his caucus be treated with fairness
 
02:21:44.270 --> 02:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
and that's what I tried to do but I
 
02:21:46.030 --> 02:21:46.040 align:start position:0%
don't think there's anything better that
 
02:21:47.990 --> 02:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
you can say about a person particularly
 
02:21:51.550 --> 02:21:51.560 align:start position:0%
one in politics other than that he
 
02:21:54.950 --> 02:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
believed that putting the state in the
 
02:21:54.960 --> 02:21:56.510 align:start position:0%
believed that putting the state in the
legislature

02:21:56.510 --> 02:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
02:21:58.590 --> 02:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
first was his
 
02:22:00.910 --> 02:22:00.920 align:start position:0%
duty and I think he's done that
 
02:22:03.270 --> 02:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
throughout his career listen to him
 
02:22:05.309 --> 02:22:05.319 align:start position:0%
frequently on the radio when I'm driving
 
02:22:08.670 --> 02:22:08.680 align:start position:0%
up to conquer in the morning and he's
 
02:22:11.030 --> 02:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
always taken that that position and that
 
02:22:14.790 --> 02:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
is really something that is far too rare
 
02:22:17.830 --> 02:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
today he really has my undying respect
 
02:22:19.469 --> 02:22:19.479 align:start position:0%
for what he's done over the years and I
 
02:22:21.990 --> 02:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
am even as a a republican very glad that
 
02:22:25.309 --> 02:22:25.319 align:start position:0%
he got to serve as speaker and certainly
 
02:22:27.630 --> 02:22:27.640 align:start position:0%
uh think he is welld deserving of that
 
02:22:29.550 --> 02:22:29.560 align:start position:0%
first title of speaker am
 
02:22:32.550 --> 02:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
Meritus there is one thing that I'm very
 
02:22:36.309 --> 02:22:36.319 align:start position:0%
very jealous of Steve for though however
 
02:22:38.990 --> 02:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
good well you
 
02:22:41.670 --> 02:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
know that's that's funny because when he
 
02:22:43.590 --> 02:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
became speaker and I was commissioner
 
02:22:45.590 --> 02:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
people were constantly referring to me
 
02:22:47.630 --> 02:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
as Steve and
 
02:22:51.270 --> 02:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
so um you know it's funny that
 
02:22:53.230 --> 02:22:53.240 align:start position:0%
back with the story I'm about to to tell
 
02:22:55.270 --> 02:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
we both just had mustaches and here we
 
02:22:58.870 --> 02:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
are today with our beards uh so we could
 
02:23:02.429 --> 02:23:02.439 align:start position:0%
probably be uh here brothers and we said
 
02:23:05.309 --> 02:23:05.319 align:start position:0%
that brothers from another mother but
 
02:23:07.230 --> 02:23:07.240 align:start position:0%
when the State House Dome was being
 
02:23:10.510 --> 02:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
refur refurbished and the the eagle was
 
02:23:13.870 --> 02:23:13.880 align:start position:0%
stripped and was just you know didn't
 
02:23:15.510 --> 02:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
look very pretty at the time but there
 
02:23:17.510 --> 02:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
was an opportunity to go all the way up
 
02:23:19.990 --> 02:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
and stand next to the eagle Steve was in
 
02:23:22.830 --> 02:23:22.840 align:start position:0%
the state house and I grabbed him and uh
 
02:23:26.070 --> 02:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
we went up to the top and stood there
 
02:23:28.230 --> 02:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
and uh Jim Rivers was up there taking
 
02:23:32.550 --> 02:23:32.560 align:start position:0%
pictures he later photoshopped so I had
 
02:23:35.790 --> 02:23:35.800 align:start position:0%
a gold helmet on and Steve had a white
 
02:23:39.550 --> 02:23:39.560 align:start position:0%
one on and that got photoshopped my
 
02:23:43.190 --> 02:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:45.950 --> 02:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
difference and but what I'm jealous
 
02:23:48.429 --> 02:23:48.439 align:start position:0%
about is that I then had a conference to
 
02:23:53.190 --> 02:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
go to and the Eagle was finished and all
 
02:23:55.710 --> 02:23:55.720 align:start position:0%
gilded and Steve got to go back up there
 
02:23:58.910 --> 02:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
again and have his picture taken with
 
02:24:01.469 --> 02:24:01.479 align:start position:0%
the Gilded eagle and by the time I got
 
02:24:04.550 --> 02:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
back from my trip the uh the staging was
 
02:24:07.590 --> 02:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
gone but Steve thank you for your years
 
02:24:09.950 --> 02:24:09.960 align:start position:0%

02:24:13.349 --> 02:24:13.359 align:start position:0%

02:24:55.830 --> 02:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
be defeated and Republicans to be passed
 
02:24:58.630 --> 02:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
and I said what a golden opportunity and
 
02:25:01.230 --> 02:25:01.240 align:start position:0%
I said no I can't I said no I'm not the
 
02:25:04.230 --> 02:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
speaker uh I'm Steve sherff I'm I'm
 
02:25:07.670 --> 02:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
Democrat and so uh but uh it was a test
 
02:25:09.990 --> 02:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
to my ethics but the other thing I want
 
02:25:13.550 --> 02:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
to say is about speaker Jasper I went to
 
02:25:16.590 --> 02:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
him one time short after he won his
 
02:25:20.070 --> 02:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
election and uh and I said Mr Speaker
 
02:25:21.790 --> 02:25:21.800 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that I know is important
 
02:25:23.230 --> 02:25:23.240 align:start position:0%
to our Democratic
 
02:25:26.070 --> 02:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
caucus I hope that if it comes to a
 
02:25:28.070 --> 02:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
point that you can vote one way or the
 
02:25:31.670 --> 02:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
other you'll support us and support this
 
02:25:33.550 --> 02:25:33.560 align:start position:0%
legislation and I remember there are
 
02:25:35.110 --> 02:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
people in his caucus that felt
 
02:25:38.110 --> 02:25:38.120 align:start position:0%
differently about it and the vote came
 
02:25:41.870 --> 02:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
up and we all looked up at the score and
 
02:25:44.790 --> 02:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
it was a tie vote and all eyes were on
 
02:25:48.590 --> 02:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
speaker Jasper and uh he voted with us
 
02:25:50.389 --> 02:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
Democrats it was a bill dealing with
 
02:25:52.750 --> 02:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
Healthcare and the bill passed by that
 
02:25:57.910 --> 02:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:00.670 --> 02:26:00.680 align:start position:0%
um you know I was shocked but then again
 
02:26:05.070 --> 02:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
I wasn't because he speaker Jasper like
 
02:26:07.110 --> 02:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
speaker packet they both have always
 
02:26:10.389 --> 02:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
been people of their word and
 
02:26:13.670 --> 02:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh it's so easy to be magnanimous and to
 
02:26:15.309 --> 02:26:15.319 align:start position:0%
do the right thing when you deal with
 
02:26:17.790 --> 02:26:17.800 align:start position:0%

Liberty we talked about the history I
 
02:29:41.349 --> 02:29:41.359 align:start position:0%
believe that this uh this is still being
 
02:29:43.510 --> 02:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
recorded I believe if it is uh there's a
 
02:29:46.910 --> 02:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
lot of history that's being uh put on
 
02:29:50.389 --> 02:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
the worldwide web via YouTube that I
 
02:29:53.190 --> 02:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
think some future historians will be uh

and I don't have
 
02:31:32.269 --> 02:31:32.279 align:start position:0%
one and now originally I was under the
 
02:31:34.429 --> 02:31:34.439 align:start position:0%
weather when Linda called me and I had
 
02:31:37.070 --> 02:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
to prepare a letter for her to read in
 
02:31:37.080 --> 02:31:38.349 align:start position:0%
to prepare a letter for her to read in
my

02:31:38.349 --> 02:31:38.359 align:start position:0%
my
 
02:31:41.830 --> 02:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
place but I can do it

02:31:48.070 --> 02:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
Linda I want to thank you for giving me
 
02:31:50.190 --> 02:31:50.200 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to comment about my
 
02:31:52.070 --> 02:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
friend Steve
 
02:31:54.349 --> 02:31:54.359 align:start position:0%
sherff as you may know he became
 
02:31:56.190 --> 02:31:56.200 align:start position:0%
chairman of the house criminal justice
 
02:31:59.429 --> 02:31:59.439 align:start position:0%
committee a few years ago realizing that
 
02:32:01.670 --> 02:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
as a former Federal Marshal he had no
 
02:32:04.190 --> 02:32:04.200 align:start position:0%
clue whatsoever about criminal
 
02:32:07.389 --> 02:32:07.399 align:start position:0%
law he sat me near his share so that I
 
02:32:10.469 --> 02:32:10.479 align:start position:0%
could prompt him from time to time that
 
02:32:14.070 --> 02:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
was advantageous as he needed a lot of
 
02:32:16.670 --> 02:32:16.680 align:start position:0%
prompting as a term ground on he must
 
02:32:18.590 --> 02:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
have realized that his expertise was
 
02:32:21.630 --> 02:32:21.640 align:start position:0%
telling everyone what to do so
 
02:32:24.269 --> 02:32:24.279 align:start position:0%
eventually he became speaker of the
 
02:32:26.910 --> 02:32:26.920 align:start position:0%
house I was familiar with Steve by now
 
02:32:29.750 --> 02:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
and realized that he needed no prompting
 
02:32:31.389 --> 02:32:31.399 align:start position:0%
I always thought that Steve was an
 
02:32:34.230 --> 02:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
honorable man so imagine my surprise
 
02:32:37.389 --> 02:32:37.399 align:start position:0%
when he in front of everyone sto by
 
02:32:40.190 --> 02:32:40.200 align:start position:0%
Thunder by vacating the chair in order
 
02:32:42.710 --> 02:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
to cast a deciding vote on the repeal of
 
02:32:44.349 --> 02:32:44.359 align:start position:0%
the death
 
02:32:46.670 --> 02:32:46.680 align:start position:0%
penalty I had been a supporter of the
 
02:32:49.150 --> 02:32:49.160 align:start position:0%
death penalty for almost 30 years and
 
02:32:52.309 --> 02:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
now I had decided to support repeal I
 
02:32:54.710 --> 02:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
think it was an override vote we
 
02:32:57.590 --> 02:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
overrode the governor's veto by one vote
 
02:33:00.070 --> 02:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
it was my vote that did it not his I
 
02:33:03.110 --> 02:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
really can't forgive him for
 
02:33:06.590 --> 02:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
that his true nature has become clear
 
02:33:08.389 --> 02:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
now he's running for an office that pays
 
02:33:08.399 --> 02:33:09.190 align:start position:0%
now he's running for an office that pays
a

02:33:09.190 --> 02:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:33:11.670 --> 02:33:11.680 align:start position:0%
salary on top of that he chose an
 
02:33:14.830 --> 02:33:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:17.429 --> 02:33:17.439 align:start position:0%
opponents there is no joy in Mudville as
 
02:33:21.269 --> 02:33:21.279 align:start position:0%
he hurdles onward to ad higher office
 
02:33:23.110 --> 02:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
again I thank him for the opportunity to
 
02:33:26.150 --> 02:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
clear the air I wish Steve all the best
 
02:33:28.630 --> 02:33:28.640 align:start position:0%
as he delves in the County government I
 
02:33:30.710 --> 02:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
take hat that he cannot boss anyone
 
02:33:32.150 --> 02:33:32.160 align:start position:0%
around or steal
 
02:33:34.910 --> 02:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
votes Steve is an honorable man and all
 
02:33:37.349 --> 02:33:37.359 align:start position:0%
kidding aside he deserves his chance and

an administrative job I'm proud to call
 
02:33:44.349 --> 02:33:44.359 align:start position:0%

02:34:29.950 --> 02:34:29.960 align:start position:0%

legislation and it was so insightful and
 
02:36:20.230 --> 02:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
that's the kind of person you are again
 
02:36:24.150 --> 02:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
to steal a line from speaker Jasper
 
02:36:26.389 --> 02:36:26.399 align:start position:0%

sit at state and federal as a substitute
 
02:37:13.230 --> 02:37:13.240 align:start position:0%
and I well remember the
 
02:37:16.309 --> 02:37:16.319 align:start position:0%
experience with mixed feelings but I
 
02:37:20.910 --> 02:37:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:23.429 --> 02:37:23.439 align:start position:0%
I don't have to say much because for
 
02:37:25.550 --> 02:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
those of you who are in the house I
 
02:37:29.750 --> 02:37:29.760 align:start position:0%

02:37:34.070 --> 02:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
Steve um in the last day of the session
 
02:37:34.080 --> 02:37:35.230 align:start position:0%
Steve um in the last day of the session

in
 
02:37:35.240 --> 02:37:36.790 align:start position:0%
in
June

02:37:36.790 --> 02:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
June
 
02:37:41.030 --> 02:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh and what has transpired just now has
 
02:37:43.950 --> 02:37:43.960 align:start position:0%
taken me down memory lane I've been here
 
02:37:49.150 --> 02:37:49.160 align:start position:0%
since 1996 and have served under uh sha
 
02:37:51.750 --> 02:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
who decided to punish me once and put me
 
02:37:52.830 --> 02:37:52.840 align:start position:0%
on two
 
02:37:57.230 --> 02:37:57.240 align:start position:0%
committees um I served under Steve who
 
02:38:00.510 --> 02:38:00.520 align:start position:0%
uh did not want me to be the chair of
 
02:38:02.870 --> 02:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
the committee I wanted to chair and in
 
02:38:06.269 --> 02:38:06.279 align:start position:0%
return gave me another two positions in
 
02:38:10.590 --> 02:38:10.600 align:start position:0%
order to help ease the pain um uh who
 
02:38:13.910 --> 02:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
have I forgotten that's and um but
 
02:38:16.429 --> 02:38:16.439 align:start position:0%
everything that has been said today
 
02:38:20.190 --> 02:38:20.200 align:start position:0%
reflects something that I think I like
 
02:38:25.830 --> 02:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
to think all of us believe at some level
 
02:38:29.150 --> 02:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
and that is that personal
 
02:38:33.550 --> 02:38:33.560 align:start position:0%
integrity and respect for each other and
 
02:38:38.230 --> 02:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
treating each other honestly is much
 
02:38:41.150 --> 02:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
more important than any piece of
 
02:38:44.750 --> 02:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
legislation that we might disagree on
 
02:38:48.990 --> 02:38:49.000 align:start position:0%
and if we can find a little bit just a
 
02:38:52.710 --> 02:38:52.720 align:start position:0%
little corner where we agree and start
 
02:38:59.469 --> 02:38:59.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:01.590 --> 02:39:01.600 align:start position:0%
create a
 
02:39:04.429 --> 02:39:04.439 align:start position:0%
change in the
 
02:39:07.389 --> 02:39:07.399 align:start position:0%
climate in the N Hampshire house because
 
02:39:10.309 --> 02:39:10.319 align:start position:0%
I believe a change would improve the
 
02:39:14.070 --> 02:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
quality of of work for all of us and if
 
02:39:18.070 --> 02:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
we were to do that it would be because
 
02:39:20.070 --> 02:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
we understand
 
02:39:23.990 --> 02:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
the value of the principles that Steve
 
02:39:29.230 --> 02:39:29.240 align:start position:0%
schliff has inspired in all of us um and
 
02:39:32.110 --> 02:39:32.120 align:start position:0%
he's not alone there's no question about
 
02:39:35.030 --> 02:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
that but he is certainly first among
 
02:39:38.590 --> 02:39:38.600 align:start position:0%
equals and um I don't quite know what
 
02:39:40.510 --> 02:39:40.520 align:start position:0%
we'll do with that you Steve but we're
 
02:39:44.309 --> 02:39:44.319 align:start position:0%
going to try to muddle through thank you
 
02:39:45.510 --> 02:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:39:47.150 --> 02:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
representative will you take any
 
02:39:49.550 --> 02:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
questions or comments um if that
 
02:39:52.230 --> 02:39:52.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate of course we uh yes I have
 
02:39:55.429 --> 02:39:55.439 align:start position:0%
the gavel yes um are there any questions
 
02:39:59.429 --> 02:39:59.439 align:start position:0%
or comments for the representative from
 
02:40:02.309 --> 02:40:02.319 align:start position:0%
Durham representative Smith had such a
 
02:40:04.870 --> 02:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
great reputation when I came to this
 
02:40:07.910 --> 02:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
house and
 
02:40:10.510 --> 02:40:10.520 align:start position:0%
um and when I was speaker I did ask her
 
02:40:12.670 --> 02:40:12.680 align:start position:0%
to go on a committee that I know wasn't
 
02:40:15.550 --> 02:40:15.560 align:start position:0%
her first choice but because of the
 
02:40:18.429 --> 02:40:18.439 align:start position:0%
circumstances she did it and she did it
 
02:40:21.070 --> 02:40:21.080 align:start position:0%
so well
 
02:40:23.429 --> 02:40:23.439 align:start position:0%
I started out on the Judiciary Committee
 
02:40:25.230 --> 02:40:25.240 align:start position:0%
and I think your F first committee is
 
02:40:27.910 --> 02:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
always a special place in your heart and
 
02:40:30.750 --> 02:40:30.760 align:start position:0%
Judiciary meant so much to me and I
 
02:40:32.510 --> 02:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
thought of the possibilities of other
 
02:40:35.070 --> 02:40:35.080 align:start position:0%
people taking that chair and I couldn't
 
02:40:37.590 --> 02:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
think of anybody better than
 
02:40:39.710 --> 02:40:39.720 align:start position:0%
representative Smith to carry on the
 
02:40:43.309 --> 02:40:43.319 align:start position:0%
strong tradition of uh bipartisanship
 
02:40:46.269 --> 02:40:46.279 align:start position:0%
fairness on a very important committee
 
02:40:48.349 --> 02:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
and again I thank her from the bottom of
 
02:40:50.590 --> 02:40:50.600 align:start position:0%
my heart instead of doing what she
 
02:40:53.230 --> 02:40:53.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to do doing what she felt was the

terms and Steve has always been a
 
02:41:41.630 --> 02:41:41.640 align:start position:0%
Workhorse and not a show horse uh the
 
02:41:43.590 --> 02:41:43.600 align:start position:0%
division I've been on in finance deals
 
02:41:46.190 --> 02:41:46.200 align:start position:0%
with Veterans Affairs and Steve was
 
02:41:48.870 --> 02:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
always there whispering in my ear trying
 
02:41:50.990 --> 02:41:51.000 align:start position:0%

Steve there was one other issue that
 
02:41:57.550 --> 02:41:57.560 align:start position:0%
Steve worked very hard on this last term
 
02:41:59.750 --> 02:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
and that was funding the retirees that
 
02:42:02.309 --> 02:42:02.319 align:start position:0%
lost their benefits more than a decade
 
02:42:05.750 --> 02:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
ago there were about 1,600 of them and
 
02:42:07.590 --> 02:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
with Steve's help and the other members
 
02:42:10.349 --> 02:42:10.359 align:start position:0%
we got a bill through the house for $26
 
02:42:13.190 --> 02:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
million to help fund those people that
 
02:42:15.030 --> 02:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
lost their benefits more than a decade
 
02:42:18.429 --> 02:42:18.439 align:start position:0%
ago so thank you for that Steve and I am
 
02:42:20.469 --> 02:42:20.479 align:start position:0%

02:42:25.309 --> 02:42:25.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:27.349 --> 02:42:27.359 align:start position:0%

wendam thank you Mr chair um I I I think
 
02:42:43.389 --> 02:42:43.399 align:start position:0%
I probably have the honor or or at least
 
02:42:45.590 --> 02:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
I hope I I I'm pretty sure I have the
 
02:42:47.790 --> 02:42:47.800 align:start position:0%
honor of of being able to say that that
 
02:42:49.590 --> 02:42:49.600 align:start position:0%
from what I've heard of all the other
 
02:42:51.950 --> 02:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
speakers I've probably known Steve
 
02:42:54.550 --> 02:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
longer than than anyone here because my
 
02:42:56.389 --> 02:42:56.399 align:start position:0%
my first interaction with Steve goes
 
02:43:02.030 --> 02:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
back if you can believe this 46 years to
 
02:43:04.910 --> 02:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
1978 when I had just come to New
 
02:43:07.389 --> 02:43:07.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as an assistant us attorney
 
02:43:10.550 --> 02:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
and Steve I believe was relatively new
 
02:43:13.830 --> 02:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
uh in the US Marshals office uh in in
 
02:43:17.510 --> 02:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh and Bob re uh who just
 
02:43:21.550 --> 02:43:21.560 align:start position:0%
recently passed away uh wonderful guy um
 
02:43:23.389 --> 02:43:23.399 align:start position:0%
was the United States Marshall at the
 
02:43:26.469 --> 02:43:26.479 align:start position:0%
time and Bill Shaheen who hired me was
 
02:43:29.389 --> 02:43:29.399 align:start position:0%
the US attorney at the time um and I
 
02:43:30.630 --> 02:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
remember one one of the things I
 
02:43:32.950 --> 02:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
remember in particular about Steve is as
 
02:43:37.510 --> 02:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
I recall there was a there was a um a
 
02:43:39.389 --> 02:43:39.399 align:start position:0%
Personnel shortage General I think
 
02:43:41.590 --> 02:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
generally in the Marshall service and so
 
02:43:43.990 --> 02:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
that meant that Mar Deputy Marshals were
 
02:43:47.030 --> 02:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
being sent around the country to travel
 
02:43:49.469 --> 02:43:49.479 align:start position:0%
transporting prisoners and this and that
 
02:43:52.349 --> 02:43:52.359 align:start position:0%
much more frequently than uh had sort of
 
02:43:55.269 --> 02:43:55.279 align:start position:0%
normally been the case and so Steve was
 
02:43:57.230 --> 02:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
all when I would be talking to him he
 
02:43:58.830 --> 02:43:58.840 align:start position:0%
was always I got I'm going to be on a
 
02:44:01.550 --> 02:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
plane tomorrow to you know Tim Buck two
 
02:44:04.230 --> 02:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
to transport somebody somewhere it was
 
02:44:06.630 --> 02:44:06.640 align:start position:0%
uh just seemed to me like a very you
 
02:44:09.550 --> 02:44:09.560 align:start position:0%
know a very difficult time uh for in
 
02:44:13.269 --> 02:44:13.279 align:start position:0%
terms of sort of personal uh uh
 
02:44:15.030 --> 02:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
sacrifices that people had to make but
 
02:44:17.630 --> 02:44:17.640 align:start position:0%
Steve always you know did it with a with
 
02:44:19.630 --> 02:44:19.640 align:start position:0%
a smile and just that was was part of
 
02:44:22.309 --> 02:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
what he had to do uh but I remember my
 
02:44:24.870 --> 02:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
interactions with him then were always
 
02:44:26.590 --> 02:44:26.600 align:start position:0%
just wonderfully friend he was just
 
02:44:28.750 --> 02:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
wonderfully friendly and and and
 
02:44:31.349 --> 02:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
courteous and and helpful and then I
 
02:44:34.309 --> 02:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
when I moving back moving on a number of
 
02:44:37.230 --> 02:44:37.240 align:start position:0%
years when I I was uh in the uh in the
 
02:44:38.830 --> 02:44:38.840 align:start position:0%
court system and particularly when I
 
02:44:41.750 --> 02:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
served as as Chief Justice of both the
 
02:44:43.469 --> 02:44:43.479 align:start position:0%
superior court and then later the
 
02:44:45.950 --> 02:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court I had occasions to deal
 
02:44:48.469 --> 02:44:48.479 align:start position:0%
with Steve um and particularly when he
 
02:44:50.590 --> 02:44:50.600 align:start position:0%
was speaker on things dealing with the
 
02:44:53.990 --> 02:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
budget those kind of things again uh
 
02:44:56.590 --> 02:44:56.600 align:start position:0%
always uh you know
 
02:44:58.349 --> 02:44:58.359 align:start position:0%
straightforward uh if he told you
 
02:45:00.110 --> 02:45:00.120 align:start position:0%
something you could take it to the bank
 
02:45:01.950 --> 02:45:01.960 align:start position:0%
and it was just a wonderfully positive
 
02:45:04.389 --> 02:45:04.399 align:start position:0%
relationship and in the in my relatively
 
02:45:05.990 --> 02:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
brief time in the house the last four
 
02:45:08.710 --> 02:45:08.720 align:start position:0%
years again nothing but completely
 
02:45:10.990 --> 02:45:11.000 align:start position:0%
positive um relationship it's just been
 
02:45:13.990 --> 02:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
a real pleasure uh uh to have the
 
02:45:16.190 --> 02:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity to work with you Steve and I
 
02:45:19.389 --> 02:45:19.399 align:start position:0%

02:45:30.950 --> 02:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
your working uh with your new position
 
02:45:32.830 --> 02:45:32.840 align:start position:0%
as County Commissioner so again thank
 
02:45:35.750 --> 02:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
you very much for your service over all
 
02:45:38.790 --> 02:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
the these so many years thank you thank
 
02:45:38.800 --> 02:45:40.469 align:start position:0%
the these so many years thank you thank
you

02:45:40.469 --> 02:45:40.479 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:45:43.150 --> 02:45:43.160 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman you
 
02:45:46.870 --> 02:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
know it's hard to believe how Bob back
 
02:45:51.510 --> 02:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh the chief and I go and uh and he
 
02:45:53.190 --> 02:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
hasn't changed a bit which drives me
 
02:45:56.830 --> 02:45:56.840 align:start position:0%
crazy but um just as young as today as
 
02:46:00.230 --> 02:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
he was then and and back then I I I
 
02:46:03.269 --> 02:46:03.279 align:start position:0%
think that us attorney's office uh had
 
02:46:05.030 --> 02:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
to have been the finest law firm in the
 
02:46:06.590 --> 02:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire at the time with
 
02:46:09.550 --> 02:46:09.560 align:start position:0%
the quality of prosecutors and uh and
 
02:46:12.190 --> 02:46:12.200 align:start position:0%
Bob Lynn is a prime example and the
 
02:46:14.309 --> 02:46:14.319 align:start position:0%
number of cases they handled in the
 
02:46:19.030 --> 02:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
intricacies and the types of crimes um
 
02:46:22.550 --> 02:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
and to watch Bob how he has progressed
 
02:46:24.309 --> 02:46:24.319 align:start position:0%
up through the New Hampshire
 
02:46:28.150 --> 02:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
court system to become chief justice and
 
02:46:31.190 --> 02:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
to see him come back here to this body
 
02:46:34.830 --> 02:46:34.840 align:start position:0%
to finish uh to
 
02:46:37.590 --> 02:46:37.600 align:start position:0%
serve it just bolds well that the
 
02:46:39.469 --> 02:46:39.479 align:start position:0%
quality of people that run for the New
 
02:46:41.590 --> 02:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire house and I think a lot of the
 
02:46:44.030 --> 02:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
public must wonder sometimes how can you
 
02:46:46.870 --> 02:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
pay somebody $100 a year and expect your
 
02:46:49.910 --> 02:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
quality people uh that put dedication
 
02:46:53.269 --> 02:46:53.279 align:start position:0%
and service above uh uh financial gain
 
02:46:55.830 --> 02:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
and Bob is a prime example of that and
 
02:46:58.269 --> 02:46:58.279 align:start position:0%
it's uh that to me is the true New
 
02:47:00.030 --> 02:47:00.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire advantage and it's so good to
 
02:47:02.790 --> 02:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
have Bob back and uh and thank you for
 
02:47:05.670 --> 02:47:05.680 align:start position:0%

here thank you and it's a great pleasure
 
02:50:29.710 --> 02:50:29.720 align:start position:0%
to be here I wanted to speak to
 
02:50:31.269 --> 02:50:31.279 align:start position:0%
something that I think has been hinted
 
02:50:33.550 --> 02:50:33.560 align:start position:0%
about but not really laid out on the
 
02:50:36.630 --> 02:50:36.640 align:start position:0%
table and that is about representative
 
02:50:40.950 --> 02:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
Sheriff humility and so um a couple of
 
02:50:42.830 --> 02:50:42.840 align:start position:0%
years ago before I was elected I've only
 
02:50:46.349 --> 02:50:46.359 align:start position:0%
served the one term I had the privilege
 
02:50:49.150 --> 02:50:49.160 align:start position:0%
to play with a great cast of characters
 
02:50:51.469 --> 02:50:51.479 align:start position:0%
in a cemetery walk in
 
02:50:54.510 --> 02:50:54.520 align:start position:0%
hackington and the director was uh Peter
 
02:50:57.429 --> 02:50:57.439 align:start position:0%
Spalding's wife Beth Spalding so it's
 
02:50:58.950 --> 02:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
interesting the county commissioner
 
02:51:01.750 --> 02:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
connection but at any rate uh I was
 
02:51:04.630 --> 02:51:04.640 align:start position:0%
amazed at what incredible actors they
 
02:51:07.550 --> 02:51:07.560 align:start position:0%
were and having a love of history and
 
02:51:11.590 --> 02:51:11.600 align:start position:0%
Native American history that we share um
 
02:51:15.710 --> 02:51:15.720 align:start position:0%
I just saw Steve as another talented
 
02:51:17.750 --> 02:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
actor then I was elected I came to the
 
02:51:19.429 --> 02:51:19.439 align:start position:0%
house and here was this wonderful Man
 
02:51:20.910 --> 02:51:20.920 align:start position:0%
Who Loved history and loved Native
 
02:51:24.349 --> 02:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
Americans and he was very uh revered
 
02:51:27.030 --> 02:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
here in the house it was clear I didn't
 
02:51:28.670 --> 02:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
put two and two together this year we
 
02:51:32.389 --> 02:51:32.399 align:start position:0%
started um our our rehearsals for the
 
02:51:35.630 --> 02:51:35.640 align:start position:0%
play we're doing this weekend and I saw
 
02:51:37.790 --> 02:51:37.800 align:start position:0%
him and I was shocked because the Two
 
02:51:40.269 --> 02:51:40.279 align:start position:0%
Worlds collag I still didn't remember he
 
02:51:42.630 --> 02:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
was from the previous cast and I said oh
 
02:51:44.710 --> 02:51:44.720 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker it's so good to see you here
 
02:51:47.229 --> 02:51:47.239 align:start position:0%
tonight and he said yeah I figured I'd
 
02:51:50.309 --> 02:51:50.319 align:start position:0%
come back and then I realized so dear I
 
02:51:52.990 --> 02:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
acted with him two years ago and didn't
 
02:51:54.990 --> 02:51:55.000 align:start position:0%
put it together but he was so humble he
 
02:51:57.190 --> 02:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
said I'm easily forgettable it's okay
 
02:51:59.910 --> 02:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
representative G you are not at all
 
02:51:59.920 --> 02:52:01.389 align:start position:0%
representative G you are not at all
easily

02:52:01.389 --> 02:52:01.399 align:start position:0%
easily
 
02:52:04.630 --> 02:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
forgettable and uh in his character
 
02:52:07.750 --> 02:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
they've got him scripted to talk about
 
02:52:10.070 --> 02:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
his character you won't be shocked to
 
02:52:11.790 --> 02:52:11.800 align:start position:0%
hear was a representative from
 
02:52:14.590 --> 02:52:14.600 align:start position:0%
hopkington sent to conquer and they're
 
02:52:17.590 --> 02:52:17.600 align:start position:0%
having him say delegate and it's not a
 
02:52:20.469 --> 02:52:20.479 align:start position:0%
delegate so a man of his stature should
 
02:52:23.389 --> 02:52:23.399 align:start position:0%
not be expected to say the wrong script
 
02:52:25.670 --> 02:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
my mission this afternoon is to get that
 
02:52:29.150 --> 02:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
script changed for him so he can give an
 
02:52:30.950 --> 02:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
accurate portrayal of our role here
 
02:52:37.750 --> 02:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:41.150 --> 02:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
