going to be executing today U but we
 
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 align:start position:0%

chair um in reviewing some of
 
00:07:18.749 --> 00:07:18.759 align:start position:0%
the testimony um I came across two that
 
00:07:21.629 --> 00:07:21.639 align:start position:0%
were submitted to us uh via email one
 
00:07:24.589 --> 00:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
from the National Insurance crime
 
00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:27.160 align:start position:0%
Bureau and one from the business and
 
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
industry Association both are opposed to
 
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.909 align:start position:0%
industry Association both are opposed to
uh

00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:32.919 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
hb314 um just as a a quick excerpt
 
00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:41.800 align:start position:0%
review House Bill 314 the nicb wres
 
00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
seeks to restrict information sharing
 
00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
with government entities even for the
 
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
purposes of investigation and
 
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
prosecution of criminal cases by state
 
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
or local law enforcement
 
00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
agencies The Bill runs counter to the
 
00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:56.680 align:start position:0%
express goals of the fraud reporting
 
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
statutes referenced above and would
 
00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:01.960 align:start position:0%
restrict nicb ability to provide
 
00:08:03.869 --> 00:08:03.879 align:start position:0%
information to New Hampshire state and
 
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
local law enforcement in order to help
 
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
protect New
 
00:08:09.749 --> 00:08:09.759 align:start position:0%
Hampshire new hampshirites who are
 
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
victims of insurance crimes that's the
 
00:08:16.029 --> 00:08:16.039 align:start position:0%
nicb the Bia business and industry
 
00:08:19.629 --> 00:08:19.639 align:start position:0%
Association excerp here Bia has strongly
 
00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:23.080 align:start position:0%
opposed HB 314 from the start
 
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
particularly because of its inclusion of
 
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:28.280 align:start position:0%
third-party providers and contractors
 
00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
that extend coverage to non-government
 
00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:32.680 align:start position:0%
entities despite the Bill's original
 
00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:36.320 align:start position:0%
intent amendments to hb314 have made the
 
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:39.200 align:start position:0%
bill worse and the best thing is to kill
 
00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:42.680 align:start position:0%
it so the Committees can concentrate on
 
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
S SP 255 the model consumer privacy
 
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
legislation already passed in 13
 
00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
States hb314 was Rewritten with no
 
00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:56.240 align:start position:0%
apparent study on potential negative
 
00:08:59.790 --> 00:08:59.800 align:start position:0%
consequences so those two pieces give me
 
00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
some concern and wonder if there's other
 
00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:04.120 align:start position:0%
commentaries to counter
 
00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
those well thank you very much for the
 
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:10.360 align:start position:0%
question I think um first with regard to
 
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:14.320 align:start position:0%
um the the uh is it nicb the insurance
 
00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
industry uh their their uh comment I did
 
00:09:22.069 --> 00:09:22.079 align:start position:0%
specifically have an email exchange with
 
00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
um is it Mr who's who's the person that
 
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:25.720 align:start position:0%
signed the
 
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
letter Mr Hand I did have an email
 
00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
exchange with Mr Hand and that in fact
 
00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:33.800 align:start position:0%
is this his concern which I thought was
 
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
a very very valid point was the the
 
00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:42.680 align:start position:0%
specific reason that on line
 
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:46.360 align:start position:0%
29 of the bill I added the language at
 
00:09:48.269 --> 00:09:48.279 align:start position:0%
the beginning unless specifically
 
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
authorized by law because he pointed out
 
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
in his um in his letter or maybe in the
 
00:09:56.949 --> 00:09:56.959 align:start position:0%
the attached the statement that was
 
00:09:59.230 --> 00:09:59.240 align:start position:0%
attached to the letter that there are
 
00:10:01.269 --> 00:10:01.279 align:start position:0%
actually some New Hampshire statutes
 
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:04.720 align:start position:0%
that direct insurance companies to
 
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
provide to disclose information in
 
00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:10.160 align:start position:0%
certain circumstances where there are uh
 
00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:13.240 align:start position:0%
where there's uh fraud or or allegations
 
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:16.120 align:start position:0%
of fraud so that
 
00:10:18.509 --> 00:10:18.519 align:start position:0%
specifically is is addressed and when I
 
00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
sent it to him he responded saying you
 
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
know that oh good that's that you know
 
00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
that that addresses Our concern um the
 
00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
other the other um more broadly and I
 
00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:33.519 align:start position:0%
and I think this at least I hope I'm not
 
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
positive but I hope this addresses the
 
00:10:41.069 --> 00:10:41.079 align:start position:0%
concern of the ba also is that we also
 
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
added in on beginning on page two on
 
00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
line three in that subsection B we added
 
00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:53.240 align:start position:0%
language to say that a third-party
 
00:10:57.269 --> 00:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
provider of information May disclose it
 
00:10:59.870 --> 00:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
um where it has reason to believe that
 
00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
the disclosure is necessary to prevent
 
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
or detect uh criminal conduct fraudulent
 
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:10.120 align:start position:0%
conduct identity theft uh harassment or
 
00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:13.880 align:start position:0%
other activity and so I I mean it it
 
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
seems to
 
00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:18.680 align:start position:0%
me with the with the provisions that
 
00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.269 align:start position:0%
me with the with the provisions that
I've

00:11:20.269 --> 00:11:20.279 align:start position:0%
I've
 
00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:22.600 align:start position:0%
discussed we really
 
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
have granted th this proposal
 
00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
grants exceptions to allow
 
00:11:33.269 --> 00:11:33.279 align:start position:0%
disclosure whenever it's really Whenever
 
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
there are reasons to allow disclosure
 
00:11:38.829 --> 00:11:38.839 align:start position:0%
and I think it it it it's you know it
 
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
the bill is not stingy in allowing
 
00:11:43.949 --> 00:11:43.959 align:start position:0%
disclosures to be made when there's some
 
00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
reason to allow the disclosure so I
 
00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:52.760 align:start position:0%
think with that it it really is sound
 
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
public policy and I think consistent
 
00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
with the recent Constitutional Amendment
 
00:11:59.590 --> 00:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
we've had in New Hampshire to say that
 
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
with with that um with those exceptions
 
00:12:07.829 --> 00:12:07.839 align:start position:0%
allowing disclosure it does make sense
 
00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:10.120 align:start position:0%
to say if you don't fit in with those
 
00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:12.040 align:start position:0%
dis if you don't fit into those
 
00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:13.720 align:start position:0%
exceptions then you can't
 
00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
disclose um and that because that it's
 
00:12:20.189 --> 00:12:20.199 align:start position:0%
necessary to protect privacy um and I
 
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
you know the the other point that I
 
00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:23.519 align:start position:0%
would make I think this is really
 
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:26.240 align:start position:0%
important point to make is remember
 
00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.710 align:start position:0%
important point to make is remember
unlike

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
unlike
 
00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
255 this this is a disclosure Bill only
 
00:12:35.829 --> 00:12:35.839 align:start position:0%
this doesn't say anything about the
 
00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:38.680 align:start position:0%
ability of anybody to collect
 
00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:41.240 align:start position:0%
information that's that those
 
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
restrictions are in 255 to the extent
 
00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
that they exist and they and I mean
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
there are some pretty significant
 
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
restrictions in 255 but this bill
 
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't say anything about anybody
 
00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
collecting information um that the only
 
00:12:59.550 --> 00:12:59.560 align:start position:0%
thing that it prohibits is the
 
00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:03.240 align:start position:0%
disclosure so the you know an insurance
 
00:13:06.269 --> 00:13:06.279 align:start position:0%
company or a bank or whatever uh if
 
00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:08.360 align:start position:0%
they're prohibited from collecting
 
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
information it's not by this bill it's
 
00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:13.240 align:start position:0%
by 255 or maybe some other you know
 
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
Federal statutes or whatever all this
 
00:13:19.509 --> 00:13:19.519 align:start position:0%
bill says is if the bank as an example
 
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
or the insurance company has information
 
00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:25.160 align:start position:0%
personal information on you or me or or
 
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
whoever they can't disclose it unless
 
00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
they meet the requirements of this bill
 
00:13:34.189 --> 00:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
and as I said I think that the the the
 
00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:36.440 align:start position:0%
the bill allows disclosure in all of the
 
00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
circumstances in which there's a reason
 
00:13:40.949 --> 00:13:40.959 align:start position:0%
for disclosure what it it seems to me
 
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
that the you know the the central thing
 
00:13:46.629 --> 00:13:46.639 align:start position:0%
that this bill will prohibit which is I
 
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
think what um what representative former
 
00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
representative Kirk and representative
 
00:13:53.069 --> 00:13:53.079 align:start position:0%
Earth were particularly concerned about
 
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
and I share their concern is to prohibit
 
00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:57.880 align:start position:0%
the the the one of the things it doesn't
 
00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
say in here is a good reason for for
 
00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
disclosure is you want to sell the
 
00:14:03.069 --> 00:14:03.079 align:start position:0%
information an insurance company wants
 
00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
to sell the information to to some third
 
00:14:08.509 --> 00:14:08.519 align:start position:0%
party to for a profit they can't do that
 
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
unless unless the unless you as a
 
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
consumer specifically consent to it and
 
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
I think that's you know that's entirely
 
00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
the way it should be um so anyway uh
 
00:14:22.829 --> 00:14:22.839 align:start position:0%
representative Smith if you wanted to
 
00:14:22.839 --> 00:14:25.350 align:start position:0%
representative Smith if you wanted to
comment

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
also no I think you did a an an
 
00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
excellent job Mr chair and I also would
 
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:34.240 align:start position:0%
like to thank our colleague for raising
 
00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
these questions because you know they're
 
00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:41.800 align:start position:0%
out there in The Ether and it's very
 
00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
this is very complex I I'll say
 
00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
again we have no business doing this it
 
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
should be done in Washington but
 
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
Washington has not been able to find a
 
00:14:59.550 --> 00:14:59.560 align:start position:0%
way to move forward and by what we're
 
00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:01.160 align:start position:0%
doing here
 
00:15:05.389 --> 00:15:05.399 align:start position:0%
today I think is I hope and what we will
 
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
do by June is adding one more state to
 
00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:11.720 align:start position:0%
the many states that are saying the same
 
00:15:14.069 --> 00:15:14.079 align:start position:0%
thing I mean not necessarily the same
 
00:15:17.829 --> 00:15:17.839 align:start position:0%
exact word but saying this is an
 
00:15:19.749 --> 00:15:19.759 align:start position:0%
important issue and if you're not going
 
00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
to act we're going to we're going to do
 
00:15:26.189 --> 00:15:26.199 align:start position:0%
something um and I hope in the end we
 
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
will have
 
00:15:30.389 --> 00:15:30.399 align:start position:0%
some certainly not this year but maybe
 
00:15:32.269 --> 00:15:32.279 align:start position:0%
in the next couple of
 
00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
years some standard language coming from
 
00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:38.600 align:start position:0%
the federal government but we've tried
 
00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:44.079 align:start position:0%
very hard to walk a very narrow line
 
00:15:44.079 --> 00:15:45.829 align:start position:0%
very hard to walk a very narrow line
here

00:15:45.829 --> 00:15:45.839 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
to respect uh um to respect the
 
00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.309 align:start position:0%
to respect uh um to respect the
capitalist

00:15:52.309 --> 00:15:52.319 align:start position:0%
capitalist
 
00:15:56.749 --> 00:15:56.759 align:start position:0%
system and also respect what New
 
00:15:59.829 --> 00:15:59.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents citizens think is
 
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
very important and that is
 
00:16:05.629 --> 00:16:05.639 align:start position:0%
privacy um but I think it's it's good
 
00:16:08.749 --> 00:16:08.759 align:start position:0%
that you raise those questions
 
00:16:14.829 --> 00:16:14.839 align:start position:0%
um and I appreciate the uh the chair's
 
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
comments um while I have my light on um
 
00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:21.720 align:start position:0%
we have now had confirmation that
 
00:16:25.389 --> 00:16:25.399 align:start position:0%
representative MC Beth will not be here
 
00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
um so we do um Shelly is on the way but
 
00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:33.240 align:start position:0%
when you are ready to call for emersion
 
00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
you should just go ahead because um it's
 
00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:38.680 align:start position:0%
not fair to keep everybody waiting too
 
00:16:41.069 --> 00:16:41.079 align:start position:0%
long well no well well thank you U
 
00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:43.160 align:start position:0%
representative Smith and I I not I I I
 
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
think I did hear representative Kenny
 
00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
indicate that he has a class at 11 so I
 
00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
don't that I think In fairness to him
 
00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
that we make make sense to to he wasn't
 
00:16:53.949 --> 00:16:53.959 align:start position:0%
brave enough to tell me
 
00:16:57.389 --> 00:16:57.399 align:start position:0%
that it may make sense to move to move
 
00:17:02.509 --> 00:17:02.519 align:start position:0%
uh forward so um all right so um is
 
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
there any further uh
 
00:17:08.029 --> 00:17:08.039 align:start position:0%
discussion representative orgon mean I
 
00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:09.720 align:start position:0%
still have some doubts about this bill I
 
00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:13.000 align:start position:0%
mean certainly it does uh send a message
 
00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:15.919 align:start position:0%
and um it's the greatly improved over
 
00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
the original bill but I'm just as
 
00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:19.839 align:start position:0%
somebody who's been involved in um
 
00:17:21.669 --> 00:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
providing online services and also
 
00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:25.000 align:start position:0%
hosting online communities there's seems
 
00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:25.880 align:start position:0%
there some
 
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
legitimate um reasons why
 
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh The Operators you know the hosts and
 
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
operators would want to know the
 
00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
real life identity the person and
 
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
sometime even share it even when it's
 
00:17:41.909 --> 00:17:41.919 align:start position:0%
mostly being done anonymously and
 
00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:44.120 align:start position:0%
there's reasons Beyond simply harassment
 
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
and fraud while you might want to uh
 
00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
reveal something is and you certainly uh
 
00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
want to know who you're dealing with
 
00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:54.760 align:start position:0%
especially if there's a especially if
 
00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
you're engaging in financial dealings
 
00:17:59.149 --> 00:17:59.159 align:start position:0%
with them too so I I
 
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
um so I'm not sure whether it's I'm not
 
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
really comfortable with this bill as is
 
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
even though I applaud the hard work that
 
00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
went into it just U I'm not sure U I'm
 
00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
not sure I'm not sure whether it's worth
 
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
it just to send a message and also like
 
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
enforceability was kind of hard so it's
 
00:18:17.909 --> 00:18:17.919 align:start position:0%
kind of hard how the state of New
 
00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:19.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is going to enforce uh you
 
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
know this law against somebody who's
 
00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
operating in another state or another
 
00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
another country so that's um so I'm not
 
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
sure exactly who this can be enforced
 
00:18:32.549 --> 00:18:32.559 align:start position:0%
against unless um so that's and also of
 
00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
course um also of course then the uh you
 
00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
know also of course you can also like
 
00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:39.640 align:start position:0%
probably say this is under the laws of
 
00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:41.320 align:start position:0%
such and such a jurisdiction other than
 
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and that also kind of cuts
 
00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
this this the state and its ability to
 
00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
enforce this law down so that's um I
 
00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:52.120 align:start position:0%
just so I I'm not like uh so I just I
 
00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:54.520 align:start position:0%
just s hesitate I just hesitate to uh
 
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
support this at this time but so and I
 
00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
know that's kind of disappointing U you
 
00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
know the chair and the ranking member
 
00:19:02.549 --> 00:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
who work very hard at this and we're
 
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
very eager to do something about it and
 
00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
also of course have some bipartisanship
 
00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:07.960 align:start position:0%
but I'm certainly glad we're doing
 
00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:10.159 align:start position:0%
something about it and being bipartisan
 
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
and I know we certainly can't rely much
 
00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
on Washington right now they're kind
 
00:19:17.549 --> 00:19:17.559 align:start position:0%
of they're kind of in a strange place so
 
00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
anyway that's all I have to say than all
 
00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
right any other comments representative
 
00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
stap yeah thank you Mr chair um just to
 
00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
cap off uh what I presented before the
 
00:19:34.029 --> 00:19:34.039 align:start position:0%
Bia letter was dated November 7th with
 
00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:35.960 align:start position:0%
their opposition opinion and of course
 
00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
your recent amendment of November 14th
 
00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
so I'm wondering if the Bia may have
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
revised any of uh their position on that
 
00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
did I may have missed something if there
 
00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:49.720 align:start position:0%
was anything between the 7th and the
 
00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
14th I I not not to me as far as I I
 
00:19:55.029 --> 00:19:55.039 align:start position:0%
have not seen anything at least as far
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
as I recall um and I and I did you know
 
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
I did check my emails this morning and I
 
00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:02.360 align:start position:0%
don't recall receiving anything thank
 
00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
you any representative Smith
 
00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
anything all right um then I'm
 
00:20:11.549 --> 00:20:11.559 align:start position:0%
uh I'm going to uh recognize uh
 
00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
motion thank you um Mr chair um as to
 
00:20:22.549 --> 00:20:22.559 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
314 I would move or to pass as amend
 
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:36.240 align:start position:0%

should or not because on the one hand
 
00:20:56.909 --> 00:20:56.919 align:start position:0%

institutions um those
 
00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
companies have personal information
 
00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
about an individual and they need to in
 
00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:16.360 align:start position:0%
order to carry out their business
 
00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:19.880 align:start position:0%
functions what they do not need to do
 
00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
however is to use that information for
 
00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.310 align:start position:0%
however is to use that information for
marketing

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
marketing
 
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
purposes or anything else that meets
 
00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
um that might meet the desires of the
 
00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:37.960 align:start position:0%
business but have nothing at all to do
 
00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
with the reason the consumer enters into
 
00:22:44.789 --> 00:22:44.799 align:start position:0%
a relationship with that business
 
00:22:48.909 --> 00:22:48.919 align:start position:0%
and this bill requires the individual to
 
00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
opt in so you want to you want to you
 
00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:57.720 align:start position:0%
don't care and you say yeah okay um all
 
00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
the cookies go ahead I mean whether
 
00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
they're chocolate chip or almond
 
00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:05.320 align:start position:0%
whatever all the cookies um but that is
 
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
up to the individual and we in this
 
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
state care about individual rights um
 
00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:13.350 align:start position:0%
state care about individual rights um
and

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
um and these businesses who were covered
 
00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
carry a lot of sensitive
 
00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
information and they should be held to a
 
00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
higher standard than businesses that are
 
00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
just selling Goods
 
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.510 align:start position:0%
 
government's

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
government's
 
00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
requests that are appropriate um and
 
00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
um one other important change and then
 
00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll end is that when this bill
 
00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
began wending its way through the
 
00:23:57.909 --> 00:23:57.919 align:start position:0%
legislative process it considered very
 
00:24:00.909 --> 00:24:00.919 align:start position:0%
very important a private right of
 
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
action and in trying to balance
 
00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:09.400 align:start position:0%
competing needs completing goals
 
00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.510 align:start position:0%
competing needs completing goals
whatever

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:24:15.909 --> 00:24:15.919 align:start position:0%
um the amendment that comes to you today
 
00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:20.360 align:start position:0%
has no private right of action and it is
 
00:24:23.669 --> 00:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
the attorney general with exclusive
 
00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:26.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement rights and I mentioned this
 
00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:30.520 align:start position:0%
as one of M examples of how On The Tight
 
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:33.240 align:start position:0%
RPP of keeping this as narrow and
 
00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
focused as possible I think we did all
 
00:24:39.549 --> 00:24:39.559 align:start position:0%
that we could do and I would hope that
 
00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
my colleagues would join me in
 
00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
supporting the amendment and and the
 
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr
 
00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:51.640 align:start position:0%
chair thank you uh other
 
00:24:54.549 --> 00:24:54.559 align:start position:0%
comments yes representative
 
00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
Andrew thank you Mr chair I am not
 
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
totally comfortable with this
 
00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
bill because I would like to see data
 
00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:08.120 align:start position:0%
from the other states that have already
 
00:25:12.269 --> 00:25:12.279 align:start position:0%
put this into law but I know that's
 
00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
impossible because a lot some of them
 
00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
are only went into effect this year but
 
00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
I'm going to vote in favor of the bill
 
00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:23.480 align:start position:0%
because I believe this a bill of this
 
00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
magnitude belongs on the house Flo floor
 
00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
in debate thank
 
00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
you other comments representative
 
00:25:36.789 --> 00:25:36.799 align:start position:0%
Stapleton I had concerns uh relative to
 
00:25:39.669 --> 00:25:39.679 align:start position:0%
what I presented with from the Bia and I
 
00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:43.480 align:start position:0%
nicb but I think you've answered most of
 
00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:48.200 align:start position:0%
that um and given that this is a
 
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support in the motions and
 
00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
there's been good arguments made and
 
00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
expressions and examples of um how this
 
00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:01.880 align:start position:0%
bill Works to protect the consumer um
 
00:26:03.909 --> 00:26:03.919 align:start position:0%
I'm willing to give it a shot and I'm
 
00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
going to support it other other
 
00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:09.880 align:start position:0%
comments and I I guess I would just want
 
00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
to make the final comment and I want to
 
00:26:14.549 --> 00:26:14.559 align:start position:0%
express my uh my thanks to all the
 
00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:17.320 align:start position:0%
people who have given input to this and
 
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
in particular I want to express my
 
00:26:20.549 --> 00:26:20.559 align:start position:0%
thanks to former representative Kirk and
 
00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:23.960 align:start position:0%
to current representative Earth for uh
 
00:26:26.389 --> 00:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
their uh sticking with us through this
 
00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
long Hall of getting done I think that
 
00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
um we've uh We've uh made a number of
 
00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
changes that represent compromises in
 
00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
many cases but I think that the the
 
00:26:39.669 --> 00:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
final bill is something I think that we
 
00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:42.200 align:start position:0%
can all be proud of and so I'm happy to
 
00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
support it any other
 
00:26:47.909 --> 00:26:47.919 align:start position:0%
comments all right I think we're ready

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
anticipation have a draft report ready
 
00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:07.039 align:start position:0%
to go and since we have a short deadline
 
00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
I would volunteer to write the report um
 
00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
for the majority representative Oregon
 
00:29:14.149 --> 00:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
will there be a Minority Report I'll
 
00:29:16.509 --> 00:29:16.519 align:start position:0%
wave my right to The Minority Report so
 
00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:17.720 align:start position:0%
actually would have been happy to have
 
00:29:20.549 --> 00:29:20.559 align:start position:0%
it go go in consent but understand that
 
00:29:22.909 --> 00:29:22.919 align:start position:0%
so yes I so no I'm not going to bother
 
00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
with that all right so it will not go on
 
00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:26.440 align:start position:0%
consent but there will be no Minority
 
00:29:30.789 --> 00:29:30.799 align:start position:0%
Report um is there any other business uh
 
00:29:32.509 --> 00:29:32.519 align:start position:0%

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
your leadership I think there has never
 
00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:52.799 align:start position:0%
been a raised voice there has never been
 
00:30:52.799 --> 00:30:55.029 align:start position:0%
been a raised voice there has never been
um

00:30:55.029 --> 00:30:55.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:59.190 --> 00:30:59.200 align:start position:0%
uh a violation of
 
00:31:03.549 --> 00:31:03.559 align:start position:0%
diplomatic and adult exchange of
 
00:31:08.269 --> 00:31:08.279 align:start position:0%
ideas including ideas that are that many
 
00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
of us hold dear and that are full of
 
00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
conflict and um I think that it has
 
00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:16.760 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with your judicial
 
00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:20.600 align:start position:0%
training it has to do with your demeanor
 
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
and I would like to thank you and I
 
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
