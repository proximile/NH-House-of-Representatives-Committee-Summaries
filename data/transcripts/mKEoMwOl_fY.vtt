representative
 
00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:17.220 align:start position:0%

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.210 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
committee

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:32.220 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
um it is a honor to be here in front of
 
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
this August committee and I did not make
 
00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:39.780 align:start position:0%
the clerk's job easier by providing
 
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
written testimony
 
00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:43.919 align:start position:0%
um but I did want to talk about a couple
 
00:07:47.629 --> 00:07:47.639 align:start position:0%
of things on the capital budget uh this
 
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:50.340 align:start position:0%
is the 12th one I've seen
 
00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:50.950 align:start position:0%
is the 12th one I've seen
um

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:53.940 align:start position:0%
and believe it or not I think some of
 
00:07:56.029 --> 00:07:56.039 align:start position:0%
the veteran members will be able to tell
 
00:07:59.390 --> 00:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
you that this one is easier than others
 
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
not easy but easier you have been
 
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:05.340 align:start position:0%
provided well top of mind hopefully
 
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:08.940 align:start position:0%
you've seen it a four-page document of
 
00:08:11.629 --> 00:08:11.639 align:start position:0%
of capital projects that were done with
 
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
arpa funds if those were not done they
 
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:17.460 align:start position:0%
would all be competing in this capital
 
00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:20.879 align:start position:0%
budget for things like rooftop unit
 
00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:23.660 align:start position:0%
Replacements at the Brown building
 
00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court HVAC upgrades all of which
 
00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
we've heard before in in these hearings
 
00:08:33.469 --> 00:08:33.479 align:start position:0%
on the capital budget
 
00:08:35.329 --> 00:08:35.339 align:start position:0%
that said
 
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
it is great that we have uh Barbara
 
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
funds that we did that with and in House
 
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:44.580 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 and separate bills
 
00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
um there is a move to use some surplus
 
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:51.240 align:start position:0%
funds for things that
 
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
if we did not use them for example the
 
00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:57.060 align:start position:0%
Senate has a bill on on replacing the
 
00:08:59.710 --> 00:08:59.720 align:start position:0%
Tramway at
 
00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:02.120 align:start position:0%
Cannon Mountain
 
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
there are monies for the legislative
 
00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:09.660 align:start position:0%
parking garage and house bill 2. all of
 
00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
which would be competing for say
 
00:09:15.829 --> 00:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
or against Rockingham the Rochester
 
00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:18.060 align:start position:0%
Court under
 
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
um Das so you're still going to have
 
00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
some work to do because you're going to
 
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
have to do some horse trading
 
00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:28.500 align:start position:0%
but I just wanted to point that out that
 
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:31.980 align:start position:0%
um something that you need to pay
 
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.110 align:start position:0%
um something that you need to pay
attention

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
attention
 
00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:35.519 align:start position:0%
now just because it happens to be at
 
00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:37.740 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 does not mean it's going to
 
00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:39.420 align:start position:0%
stay there
 
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
um I I know when I was here last week
 
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.850 align:start position:0%
um I I know when I was here last week
and

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:43.860 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
um the commissioner of Corrections and
 
00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:50.220 align:start position:0%
her staff was talking about a total of
 
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
50 million dollars within House Bill 2
 
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.769 align:start position:0%
50 million dollars within House Bill 2
for

00:09:54.769 --> 00:09:54.779 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:09:56.949 --> 00:09:56.959 align:start position:0%
um planning and other
 
00:09:59.329 --> 00:09:59.339 align:start position:0%
items at the Men's prison here in
 
00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:02.120 align:start position:0%
Concord last Monday
 
00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
division one of Finance stripped 40
 
00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:07.140 align:start position:0%
million of that 50 million out of the
 
00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:09.240 align:start position:0%
house bill to
 
00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:11.940 align:start position:0%
um so I might suggest you put that 40
 
00:10:14.329 --> 00:10:14.339 align:start position:0%
million into the capital budget but you
 
00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:16.740 align:start position:0%
just need to know that we're kicking the
 
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
can further down the road on the Men's
 
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
prison unless the Senate unless the
 
00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:25.740 align:start position:0%
house says something on the floor or the
 
00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:27.300 align:start position:0%
Senate does something when they get
 
00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:29.100 align:start position:0%
House Bill too
 
00:10:30.949 --> 00:10:30.959 align:start position:0%
and the rule of thumb that we've used
 
00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:33.240 align:start position:0%
before is something around 10 percent
 
00:10:35.769 --> 00:10:35.779 align:start position:0%
for planning and if you're looking at
 
00:10:38.449 --> 00:10:38.459 align:start position:0%
300 to 400 million dollars for a new
 
00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:40.260 align:start position:0%
prison you're going to need that 40
 
00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
million dollars to do some planning
 
00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:43.970 align:start position:0%
million dollars to do some planning
um

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:43.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
that said you've heard a lot of agencies
 
00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:49.260 align:start position:0%
come in and I've looked at the paperwork
 
00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:52.260 align:start position:0%
and kind of watched online some of them
 
00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:55.860 align:start position:0%
have been here for some of them that
 
00:10:57.829 --> 00:10:57.839 align:start position:0%
the agencies have come in with
 
00:11:01.009 --> 00:11:01.019 align:start position:0%
additional requests you need to look at
 
00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:03.839 align:start position:0%
those closely
 
00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
and while
 
00:11:08.509 --> 00:11:08.519 align:start position:0%
the treasurer has given you a number
 
00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:11.700 align:start position:0%
that you can use it has been my
 
00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:13.980 align:start position:0%
experience that if you increase it by 10
 
00:11:16.269 --> 00:11:16.279 align:start position:0%
15 million dollars
 
00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:19.380 align:start position:0%
over the 130 or so that the governor is
 
00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
suggesting it does not move the needle
 
00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:25.500 align:start position:0%
on the data for debt ratio affordability
 
00:11:29.329 --> 00:11:29.339 align:start position:0%
studies so you do have some
 
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
um room to to add some things and one of
 
00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:34.620 align:start position:0%
the things I would strongly recommend
 
00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
um at not we that you add
 
00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:43.980 align:start position:0%
to the capital budget is the winuscom
 
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:45.650 align:start position:0%
to the capital budget is the winuscom
CTE

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:45.660 align:start position:0%
CTE
 
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
if you look at everything that the
 
00:11:50.569 --> 00:11:50.579 align:start position:0%
Department of Education handed out to
 
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
you you will notice that
 
00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
if you only do one CTE a year it takes
 
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
40 years to to get to the school again
 
00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:03.060 align:start position:0%
if you do too it's only 20 years before
 
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
you uh revamp them
 
00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:08.820 align:start position:0%
so we need to stay on a schedule of
 
00:12:12.829 --> 00:12:12.839 align:start position:0%
doing tube or biennium and I think that
 
00:12:15.069 --> 00:12:15.079 align:start position:0%
within this budget
 
00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:19.100 align:start position:0%
and if uh representative Jack and crew
 
00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
on Monday found any additional money
 
00:12:23.829 --> 00:12:23.839 align:start position:0%
some of that can go to it
 
00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
there is that but back to the agencies
 
00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
coming in asking for additional things
 
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
you have to ask yourself is it a
 
00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
a want or a true need the agency will
 
00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:40.620 align:start position:0%
tell you it's a need every agency will
 
00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
do that and if I was a commissioner of
 
00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:45.180 align:start position:0%
any agency I'd come in to tell you the
 
00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:47.519 align:start position:0%
same thing but at some point you have to
 
00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:51.180 align:start position:0%
work through what can be afford what is
 
00:12:53.329 --> 00:12:53.339 align:start position:0%
the highest priority not for that agency
 
00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:57.240 align:start position:0%
but for the state and that cuts across
 
00:12:59.810 --> 00:12:59.820 align:start position:0%
all of the agencies you know there there
 
00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:02.220 align:start position:0%
are things that they've come in and
 
00:13:05.449 --> 00:13:05.459 align:start position:0%
asked to have money repurposed or do
 
00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:07.860 align:start position:0%
that because the federal government will
 
00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:10.200 align:start position:0%
pay a chunk of it
 
00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
um you have to ask yourself is that
 
00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:14.700 align:start position:0%
Federal money guaranteed are we just
 
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
putting money up hoping that it's going
 
00:13:19.129 --> 00:13:19.139 align:start position:0%
to come so
 
00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
I wish you luck this afternoon or
 
00:13:23.449 --> 00:13:23.459 align:start position:0%
whenever you start on your work sessions
 
00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
it is always a
 
00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:29.820 align:start position:0%
challenge to put it together and to come
 
00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:33.540 align:start position:0%
out with a compromise as the chairman
 
00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:36.060 align:start position:0%
said it is what the first meeting I
 
00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
think when he started all these the goal
 
00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:40.620 align:start position:0%
is and always has been for this
 
00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:43.980 align:start position:0%
committee to present this capital budget
 
00:13:47.269 --> 00:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
to the the house and have it go on a
 
00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:48.740 align:start position:0%
Voice vote
 
00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:52.740 align:start position:0%
and most year most biennium that's what
 
00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:53.530 align:start position:0%
and most year most biennium that's what
happens

00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:53.540 align:start position:0%
happens
 
00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:56.540 align:start position:0%
because this committee does good work
 
00:13:59.829 --> 00:13:59.839 align:start position:0%
and I expect that they will continue
 
00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
that said Mr chair but I did not use the
 
00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:04.700 align:start position:0%
whole 10 minutes I put down
 
00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:09.240 align:start position:0%
but I would take any questions if
 
00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:10.980 align:start position:0%
anybody has any
 
00:14:13.629 --> 00:14:13.639 align:start position:0%
I don't see a lot of people
 
00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:17.820 align:start position:0%
behind me talking thank you thank you
 
00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:18.710 align:start position:0%
behind me talking thank you thank you
um

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:21.240 align:start position:0%
Mr Graham
 
00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
um and I really appreciate the comments
 
00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:27.240 align:start position:0%
for the committee are there questions of
 
00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:29.700 align:start position:0%
our former chairman
 
00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:31.750 align:start position:0%
our former chairman
foreign

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:14:34.069 --> 00:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
yes please I'm sorry I can't see in the
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
light over there thank you chairman and
 
00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate those words as
 
00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:40.380 align:start position:0%
someone who's just new on the committee
 
00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:42.959 align:start position:0%
to kind of get some uh perspective I
 
00:14:44.329 --> 00:14:44.339 align:start position:0%
want to go back and just your your
 
00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:47.220 align:start position:0%
comments about the prison a quick story
 
00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:49.740 align:start position:0%
my grand uh great uh
 
00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:53.100 align:start position:0%
was born with uh birth defects way back
 
00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:55.740 align:start position:0%
a hundred years ago or so and she wound
 
00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:57.180 align:start position:0%
up in Laconia
 
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
chained to a bed so my recollection of
 
00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
the of how the state has funded for
 
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
things like people who are not who are
 
00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
people who are marginalized I guess is
 
00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
the word they use today is that we're
 
00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:11.820 align:start position:0%
very much behind the eight ball so
 
00:15:14.389 --> 00:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
that's that's my bias at this point so
 
00:15:15.769 --> 00:15:15.779 align:start position:0%
I'd just like to get hear your opinion
 
00:15:17.389 --> 00:15:17.399 align:start position:0%
about the uh the prison and the funding
 
00:15:17.399 --> 00:15:18.110 align:start position:0%
about the uh the prison and the funding
port

00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
port
 
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
thank you there is a definite need for a
 
00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:25.740 align:start position:0%
replacement facility
 
00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:28.980 align:start position:0%
um for the Men's prison
 
00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:31.860 align:start position:0%
um I think many of the the veterans
 
00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:34.069 align:start position:0%
um I think many of the the veterans
members

00:15:34.069 --> 00:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
um have been on tours of it where they
 
00:15:39.889 --> 00:15:39.899 align:start position:0%
have tarps trying to keep the the runoff
 
00:15:41.629 --> 00:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
water coming through the roof and
 
00:15:44.509 --> 00:15:44.519 align:start position:0%
everything else off of the kitchen uh
 
00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:48.420 align:start position:0%
and it it is not a good situation as you
 
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
heard from the commissioner and her
 
00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
staff it is a six plus year process to
 
00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:57.720 align:start position:0%
do that it took us almost that long to
 
00:16:01.069 --> 00:16:01.079 align:start position:0%
do the women's prison in the same locale
 
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
the challenge will be to come up with
 
00:16:06.769 --> 00:16:06.779 align:start position:0%
the money to do it
 
00:16:06.779 --> 00:16:07.970 align:start position:0%
the money to do it
um

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:07.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:10.500 align:start position:0%
if I had the magic wand I'd give it to
 
00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
you to tell you how to do it I don't it
 
00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:17.100 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a challenge for
 
00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
um the committee
 
00:16:23.449 --> 00:16:23.459 align:start position:0%
and the legislature to figure out how to
 
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
fund that that said the reason we have a
 
00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
new uh women's prison is because we lost
 
00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:32.940 align:start position:0%
a lawsuit
 
00:16:37.249 --> 00:16:37.259 align:start position:0%
and we had to build a replacement
 
00:16:40.249 --> 00:16:40.259 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure we want to wait till we
 
00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:43.500 align:start position:0%
lose a lawsuit on the Men's prison
 
00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:44.150 align:start position:0%
lose a lawsuit on the Men's prison
um

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:46.740 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying that there is one but if
 
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
there is one we may end up spending more
 
00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
than what we would envision
 
00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
now one of the things that we lost the
 
00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:57.720 align:start position:0%
lawsuit on and why it's in there is to
 
00:16:59.689 --> 00:16:59.699 align:start position:0%
secure psychiatric unit is in the Men's
 
00:16:59.699 --> 00:17:01.310 align:start position:0%
secure psychiatric unit is in the Men's
prison

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:01.320 align:start position:0%
prison
 
00:17:08.289 --> 00:17:08.299 align:start position:0%
um the goal would be in my estimation a
 
00:17:12.289 --> 00:17:12.299 align:start position:0%
secure forensic hospital for those
 
00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:14.839 align:start position:0%
people who are
 
00:17:17.929 --> 00:17:17.939 align:start position:0%
not guilty by reason of insanity I think
 
00:17:20.689 --> 00:17:20.699 align:start position:0%
that's the term but some of them are
 
00:17:22.669 --> 00:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
dangerous people and they need to be
 
00:17:22.679 --> 00:17:23.890 align:start position:0%
dangerous people and they need to be
secured

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:23.900 align:start position:0%
secured
 
00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:28.260 align:start position:0%
there is proposals going around for
 
00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:29.330 align:start position:0%
there is proposals going around for
um

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:29.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
take your take your pick on how many
 
00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:34.260 align:start position:0%
beds the new one will have and where it
 
00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:37.380 align:start position:0%
will be both of those are up but we need
 
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
00:17:42.409 --> 00:17:42.419 align:start position:0%
it is not a new problem with the Men's
 
00:17:42.419 --> 00:17:43.549 align:start position:0%
it is not a new problem with the Men's
prison

00:17:43.549 --> 00:17:43.559 align:start position:0%
prison
 
00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:46.440 align:start position:0%
I know that a couple of members
 
00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.870 align:start position:0%
I know that a couple of members
um

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:49.740 align:start position:0%
last week
 
00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:52.380 align:start position:0%
um were dismayed that it was going to be
 
00:17:58.490 --> 00:17:58.500 align:start position:0%
as expensive and that it was that bad
 
00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
it's been that bad most of the time I've
 
00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
been here and I came up here in 2000 and
 
00:18:06.669 --> 00:18:06.679 align:start position:0%
the situation has only gotten worse
 
00:18:09.169 --> 00:18:09.179 align:start position:0%
we've never been able to find the money
 
00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
we put Band-Aids on the problem just
 
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
like we've been doing with the stores uh
 
00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
Street Garage for the legislature and we
 
00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:19.860 align:start position:0%
finally found the will and the money to
 
00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:22.140 align:start position:0%
build a new one hopefully
 
00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:22.970 align:start position:0%
build a new one hopefully
um

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:22.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
but it is something that is
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
going to have to get started this
 
00:18:31.789 --> 00:18:31.799 align:start position:0%
biennium because if you Kick the Can
 
00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:33.660 align:start position:0%
it's another two years before you even
 
00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:34.750 align:start position:0%
it's another two years before you even
start

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:34.760 align:start position:0%
start
 
00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
and so I don't know what's going to
 
00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:40.620 align:start position:0%
happen with with money in House Bill 2
 
00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
either in the house or the Senate but is
 
00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:44.940 align:start position:0%
something that I thought you all needed
 
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
to be cognizant of because the
 
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner of of Corrections did
 
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
mention it and talk about what she
 
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to do with it and that she wasn't
 
00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
asking for it in in this budget so
 
00:18:59.029 --> 00:18:59.039 align:start position:0%
there's there's that
 
00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:02.340 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
just a brief caption in something that I
 
00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:17.700 align:start position:0%
was glancing at recently after I had
 
00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:20.460 align:start position:0%
been at the Men's prison
 
00:19:24.529 --> 00:19:24.539 align:start position:0%
but the the sentence that I remember was
 
00:19:24.539 --> 00:19:25.789 align:start position:0%
but the the sentence that I remember was
that

00:19:25.789 --> 00:19:25.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:28.020 align:start position:0%
in addition to other things whether
 
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
there's a it was lawsuit driven meaning
 
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
if something gets so bad there might be
 
00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
a lawsuit to make you do something and
 
00:19:37.909 --> 00:19:37.919 align:start position:0%
what jumped out at me was the fact that
 
00:19:42.169 --> 00:19:42.179 align:start position:0%
a lawsuit maybe even a pending one is
 
00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:45.720 align:start position:0%
also affects your bond rating also is
 
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
that an accurate statement in Europe I
 
00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
would defer answering that question to
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
the state treasurer she is the expert on
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
bonds and bond rating anything I say
 
00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:02.580 align:start position:0%
would be anecdotal so I just can't
 
00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:05.700 align:start position:0%
answer that question but
 
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
having been around here for long enough
 
00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:11.820 align:start position:0%
that when we lose lawsuits it usually
 
00:20:15.529 --> 00:20:15.539 align:start position:0%
costs us more than if we're just done
 
00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:17.940 align:start position:0%
the planning and and completed whatever
 
00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:20.220 align:start position:0%
project it was
 
00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:30.529 --> 00:20:30.539 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
00:20:33.169 --> 00:20:33.179 align:start position:0%
I want to thank you for appearing and
 
00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
you'll see with your time for
 
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
questioning you did far exceed 10
 
00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:40.380 align:start position:0%
minutes so we thank you for the long
 
00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:43.020 align:start position:0%
drive and being here in committee and
 
00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:45.660 align:start position:0%
and assisting where you do thank you
 
00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:48.900 align:start position:0%
um you're welcome and I
 
00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
um thank the committee for allowing me
 
00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:52.980 align:start position:0%
to speak and
 
00:20:55.549 --> 00:20:55.559 align:start position:0%
best of luck sorting out all of the
 
00:20:59.630 --> 00:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
requests and the rest it is always a
 
00:21:02.029 --> 00:21:02.039 align:start position:0%
wonderful work in progress thank you Mr
 
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:10.740 align:start position:0%
are there others wishing to testify on
 
00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
House Bill 25 that have not had a chance
 
00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:24.169 --> 00:21:24.179 align:start position:0%
I thought our representative was going
 
00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:27.500 align:start position:0%

I'd just like to note that the only
 
00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:21.180 align:start position:0%
reason the committee has held on to this
 
00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
uh bill for a number several weeks is
 
00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:27.720 align:start position:0%

of gilmington board of Selectmen that
 
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
they were in favor of house bill 189. is
 
00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
um yes please representative Newman
 
00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:51.900 align:start position:0%
when I I read
 
00:36:55.069 --> 00:36:55.079 align:start position:0%
what a little bit about um
 
00:36:58.370 --> 00:36:58.380 align:start position:0%
private corn Oiler I was struck by the
 
00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:00.900 align:start position:0%
fact that he was born in Concord and
 
00:37:05.349 --> 00:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
then went to school in in
 
00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:07.500 align:start position:0%
excuse me in Gilman 10 and then
 
00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:09.540 align:start position:0%
graduated from the Guilford High School
 
00:37:12.349 --> 00:37:12.359 align:start position:0%
but I was mostly impressed by comments
 
00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
that I read about his stage from his
 
00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:16.980 align:start position:0%
teachers and Friends
 
00:37:19.609 --> 00:37:19.619 align:start position:0%
the teachers commented that
 
00:37:22.690 --> 00:37:22.700 align:start position:0%
he had a true sense of right and wrong
 
00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:26.220 align:start position:0%
and and that just that that impressed
 
00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
them and that impressed me when I read
 
00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:30.420 align:start position:0%
that about them unfortunately he was
 
00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
only 25 when he was killed in Iraq but
 
00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:37.260 align:start position:0%
one of his goals at an early age was to
 
00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
join the Army and he did so he lived his
 
00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:41.820 align:start position:0%
life and apparently he knew right from
 
00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:45.560 align:start position:0%
wrong and followed that as his
 
00:37:49.069 --> 00:37:49.079 align:start position:0%
his true north compass thank you thank

00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
motion has been made to retain by
 
00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:07.740 align:start position:0%

Cloutier House Bill 361 is there a
second

00:40:09.310 --> 00:40:09.320 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:40:13.609 --> 00:40:13.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:13.619 --> 00:40:16.490 align:start position:0%
 
discussion

00:40:16.490 --> 00:40:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:19.380 align:start position:0%
I um I will just make a couple comments
 
00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:23.460 align:start position:0%
if I could when we read back to the
 
00:40:27.410 --> 00:40:27.420 align:start position:0%
formation of Peace Development Authority
 
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
um it the mission number one was what
 
00:40:32.810 --> 00:40:32.820 align:start position:0%
what was the benefit that would come out
 
00:40:34.970 --> 00:40:34.980 align:start position:0%
of that Authority for the state number
 
00:40:38.930 --> 00:40:38.940 align:start position:0%
one number two would be a regional and
 
00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:41.700 align:start position:0%
then finally third is local
 
00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:44.690 align:start position:0%
then finally third is local
and

00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:48.349 --> 00:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
um the bill suggest uh changing the
 
00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:51.180 align:start position:0%
membership and appointing and being the
 
00:40:53.329 --> 00:40:53.339 align:start position:0%
speaker and then tying the speaker to
 
00:40:53.339 --> 00:40:54.349 align:start position:0%
speaker and then tying the speaker to
who

00:40:54.349 --> 00:40:54.359 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:40:57.710 --> 00:40:57.720 align:start position:0%
he could appoint that he or she
 
00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:04.370 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:41:04.370 --> 00:41:04.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:06.370 --> 00:41:06.380 align:start position:0%
flies in the face of the original
 
00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
mandate for the peace Authority which is
 
00:41:11.329 --> 00:41:11.339 align:start position:0%
supposed to be State interest first and
 
00:41:13.849 --> 00:41:13.859 align:start position:0%
it was tying the speaker to appointing
 
00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:16.380 align:start position:0%
people only from towns that uh the two
 
00:41:18.829 --> 00:41:18.839 align:start position:0%
towns that we're concerned the other the
 
00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
other thing that some I sometimes I
 
00:41:24.349 --> 00:41:24.359 align:start position:0%
forget over the years is that was a
 
00:41:27.109 --> 00:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
that's a government facility that we
 
00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:29.240 align:start position:0%
basically have a lease over
 
00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:32.460 align:start position:0%
and we have to be cognant all the time
 
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
of um of the FAA and other obligations
 
00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:41.220 align:start position:0%
we have there so we we we truly need to
 
00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:43.500 align:start position:0%
think in more of a State Global position
 
00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:48.540 align:start position:0%
than uh than just the local town so I if
 
00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:50.940 align:start position:0%
if there is an interest to rework this
 
00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
we will do that with the remainder of
 
00:41:59.150 --> 00:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:05.810 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:42:05.810 --> 00:42:05.820 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:07.069 align:start position:0%

yes Mr chair I move itl on House Bill

00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:09.660 align:start position:0%
the clerk seconded by the Vice chairman
 
00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:13.020 align:start position:0%
itl House Bill 480 relative the
 
00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:15.300 align:start position:0%
intersection between route 302 and East
 
00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
Conway Road
 
00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
uh in Conway
 
00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:22.910 align:start position:0%
uh in Conway
um discussion

00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
um discussion
 
00:44:25.069 --> 00:44:25.079 align:start position:0%
yes represent below
 
00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:26.940 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify
 
00:44:29.569 --> 00:44:29.579 align:start position:0%
um so we've heard that dot is planning
 
00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:31.380 align:start position:0%
to build a larger roundabout than what
 
00:44:32.809 --> 00:44:32.819 align:start position:0%
was originally proposed is that correct
 
00:44:34.309 --> 00:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
that would be true that would be the
 
00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:42.410 --> 00:44:42.420 align:start position:0%
represent Faulkner I
 
00:44:45.309 --> 00:44:45.319 align:start position:0%
my feeling is that uh
 
00:44:47.809 --> 00:44:47.819 align:start position:0%
there's a process that the department
 
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
follows that you know starts with local
 
00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:52.490 align:start position:0%
follows that you know starts with local
involvement

00:44:52.490 --> 00:44:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
considers engineering design cost issues
 
00:44:57.530 --> 00:44:57.540 align:start position:0%
that that's a process that we ought to
 
00:44:59.930 --> 00:44:59.940 align:start position:0%
have some faith in and
 
00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
I would say that it's
 
00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't be involved in picking
 
00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
details of design except under the most
 
00:45:09.530 --> 00:45:09.540 align:start position:0%
extraordinary circumstances and I I
 
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
don't think that we have those here so
 
00:45:13.550 --> 00:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
I'm I I don't think that I wouldn't want
 
00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
to interpret this as our picking one one
 
00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:18.420 align:start position:0%
solution versus another but rather a
 
00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:20.460 align:start position:0%
statement that
 
00:45:23.089 --> 00:45:23.099 align:start position:0%
we're staying out of it until unless
 
00:45:25.270 --> 00:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
there's something
 
00:45:28.250 --> 00:45:28.260 align:start position:0%
unsolvable that we have to get it uh get
 
00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
involved in so
 
00:45:32.450 --> 00:45:32.460 align:start position:0%
uh I don't think that
 
00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:34.980 align:start position:0%
I mean I don't want to endorse one one
 
00:45:37.309 --> 00:45:37.319 align:start position:0%
solution over another would rather let
 
00:45:39.050 --> 00:45:39.060 align:start position:0%
the local process do that
 
00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Faulkner very
 
00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
well said almost sounds like a blurb
 
00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:45.240 align:start position:0%

I will cycle that motion Mr chairman
 
00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Cloutier uh for
 
00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
the second
 
00:48:35.329 --> 00:48:35.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:37.849 --> 00:48:37.859 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman yes I guess I I feel to
 
00:48:39.530 --> 00:48:39.540 align:start position:0%
speak and I've done a lot of research
 
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
and you may have seen some of the I had
 
00:48:44.089 --> 00:48:44.099 align:start position:0%
the researchers send on a uh uh there
 
00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
was a committee that was set up I
 
00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:47.640 align:start position:0%
believe you were on it representative
 
00:48:49.849 --> 00:48:49.859 align:start position:0%
Mills and some other members who are no
 
00:48:52.970 --> 00:48:52.980 align:start position:0%
longer represent a senator mirzell and
 
00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
uh in 2016 and then I think she I think
 
00:48:58.190 --> 00:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
it was actually then senator feltis who
 
00:48:59.390 --> 00:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
was also on the committee at the time
 
00:49:02.329 --> 00:49:02.339 align:start position:0%
and she and Senator Phelps has tried to
 
00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
get a bill through that came out of it
 
00:49:06.829 --> 00:49:06.839 align:start position:0%
but it was killed in the Senate but
 
00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:09.060 align:start position:0%
getting back to this bill
 
00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
I don't like this bill because of the
 
00:49:14.210 --> 00:49:14.220 align:start position:0%
word requires town city state
 
00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:15.720 align:start position:0%
departments the state institutions
 
00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
because I'm not a constitutional lawyer
 
00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
but I think it could fly in the face of
 
00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Constitution's part
 
00:49:25.930 --> 00:49:25.940 align:start position:0%
one article 28a of no unfunded
 
00:49:28.609 --> 00:49:28.619 align:start position:0%
mandates uh and I think if if the
 
00:49:29.809 --> 00:49:29.819 align:start position:0%
state's going to do it they would have
 
00:49:31.370 --> 00:49:31.380 align:start position:0%
to pay for it oh
 
00:49:34.069 --> 00:49:34.079 align:start position:0%
the other thing is I look at the revised
 
00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal note dated I think there was a
 
00:49:37.329 --> 00:49:37.339 align:start position:0%
fiscal and updated
 
00:49:40.130 --> 00:49:40.140 align:start position:0%
January 30th the original Bill had one
 
00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:41.150 align:start position:0%
January 30th the original Bill had one
dated

00:49:41.150 --> 00:49:41.160 align:start position:0%
dated
 
00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:43.740 align:start position:0%
uh January 9th and I don't know if
 
00:49:45.109 --> 00:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
there's much difference but it still
 
00:49:47.210 --> 00:49:47.220 align:start position:0%
says expenditures
 
00:49:49.930 --> 00:49:49.940 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year starting fiscal year
 
00:49:53.530 --> 00:49:53.540 align:start position:0%
2024-25 26 Etc both state and local
 
00:49:56.329 --> 00:49:56.339 align:start position:0%
indeterminable and that sort of scares
 
00:49:57.710 --> 00:49:57.720 align:start position:0%
me I mean I think
 
00:49:59.210 --> 00:49:59.220 align:start position:0%
if I'm going to do a state program
 
00:50:00.829 --> 00:50:00.839 align:start position:0%
especially I'm going to want to know how
 
00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:04.020 align:start position:0%
much it's going to cost and it's also
 
00:50:06.410 --> 00:50:06.420 align:start position:0%
who knows what if it's you know if it's
 
00:50:08.270 --> 00:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
mandated what would cost the cities and
 
00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:09.950 align:start position:0%
mandated what would cost the cities and
towns

00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
towns
 
00:50:12.109 --> 00:50:12.119 align:start position:0%
um and I still think it at the very
 
00:50:14.569 --> 00:50:14.579 align:start position:0%
least until we fix our our situation
 
00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
when our state's Highway fund we ought
 
00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
to be careful about adding new programs
 
00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:21.300 align:start position:0%
but I do want to make it clear to people
 
00:50:22.730 --> 00:50:22.740 align:start position:0%
here that I have nothing against
 
00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
complete streets as a concept uh and I
 
00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:28.500 align:start position:0%
think several cities uh I don't I think
 
00:50:30.109 --> 00:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
conquer did it but I can't swear it
 
00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
since I I but I know the City of
 
00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
Claremont my city sort of used some of
 
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
the concepts to revitalize its downtown
 
00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh made it one way banned trucks and we
 
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
had to work they had to work with Dot
 
00:50:45.410 --> 00:50:45.420 align:start position:0%
and I helped them do that rearrange the
 
00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
whole truck route so there's no more
 
00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:48.300 align:start position:0%
trucks going through Pleasant Street
 
00:50:50.809 --> 00:50:50.819 align:start position:0%
where a lot of businesses are but we're
 
00:50:52.370 --> 00:50:52.380 align:start position:0%
we're trying to revitalize the downtown
 
00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:54.540 align:start position:0%
to make it more friendly to pedestrians
 
00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
you know and add apartment buildings
 
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
small shops Etc because this is the way
 
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
we feel or the city feels the way to go
 
00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
for our downtowns I don't mean to go on
 
00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
and on but I think we use some of those
 
00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
Concepts so I don't have anything
 
00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:09.900 align:start position:0%
against it because I think the city
 
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
council did the right thing and they
 
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
were smart they waited until they had to
 
00:51:14.809 --> 00:51:14.819 align:start position:0%
dig up all their sewer lines they had to
 
00:51:16.970 --> 00:51:16.980 align:start position:0%
replace them anyway to save money so I
 
00:51:18.290 --> 00:51:18.300 align:start position:0%
don't even know whether they got state
 
00:51:19.849 --> 00:51:19.859 align:start position:0%
or federal aid
 
00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
but the but the point point is the other
 
00:51:25.370 --> 00:51:25.380 align:start position:0%
thing a top-down approach I'm concerned
 
00:51:27.349 --> 00:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
about that especially now not only I
 
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
represent the City of Claremont but the
 
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
town of Croydon a very small town and
 
00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
their needs may be different uh and I
 
00:51:36.650 --> 00:51:36.660 align:start position:0%
and I've way back I used to represent
 
00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:38.940 align:start position:0%
two other towns unity and lemster for a
 
00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
while when I was a rep but again there
 
00:51:42.349 --> 00:51:42.359 align:start position:0%
there are different needs
 
00:51:45.290 --> 00:51:45.300 align:start position:0%
so I I don't know if I want to mandate
 
00:51:47.210 --> 00:51:47.220 align:start position:0%
stuff that may be appropriate for a big
 
00:51:49.790 --> 00:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
city like Claremont but not for a small
 
00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
town like Croydon that's the way I look
 
00:51:53.089 --> 00:51:53.099 align:start position:0%
at it
 
00:51:56.089 --> 00:51:56.099 align:start position:0%
um so I I feel that this bill is not
 
00:51:58.190 --> 00:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
ready for for prime time maybe there are
 
00:51:59.750 --> 00:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
other ways to do it
 
00:52:01.849 --> 00:52:01.859 align:start position:0%
but I think it's it's got to be more of
 
00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
a maybe a pilot program maybe eight if a
 
00:52:07.849 --> 00:52:07.859 align:start position:0%
community wants it but not it's it
 
00:52:09.650 --> 00:52:09.660 align:start position:0%
sounds like to me this could mandate
 
00:52:13.010 --> 00:52:13.020 align:start position:0%
every municipality to do things a
 
00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:15.180 align:start position:0%
certain way which may be fine for big
 
00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
cities but may not be fine for our
 
00:52:19.790 --> 00:52:19.800 align:start position:0%
smaller committees thank you Mr chairman
 
00:52:23.569 --> 00:52:23.579 align:start position:0%
I I um yes represent uh excuse me
 
00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
represent Mills thank you Mr chair as a
 
00:52:28.849 --> 00:52:28.859 align:start position:0%
member of that original study committee
 
00:52:31.010 --> 00:52:31.020 align:start position:0%
I just want to assure everybody that
 
00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
what we had found was that the dot
 
00:52:36.890 --> 00:52:36.900 align:start position:0%
understands and completely tries to use
 
00:52:39.109 --> 00:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
the complete streets program as a
 
00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:41.880 align:start position:0%
guideline however it is not always
 
00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
feasible or practical at that time in my
 
00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
town of Derry we had a great example
 
00:52:50.329 --> 00:52:50.339 align:start position:0%
we've got we've got a major it's a
 
00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:51.900 align:start position:0%
highway it's a rural highway
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
intersection that had to be rebuilt
 
00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
because of a line of sight and they were
 
00:52:59.450 --> 00:52:59.460 align:start position:0%
going to put in a stoplight
 
00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
and because of the fact that this uh
 
00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
complete streets program was in effect
 
00:53:07.970 --> 00:53:07.980 align:start position:0%
at the time the D.O.T was they thought
 
00:53:09.349 --> 00:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
they were under a mandate that they had
 
00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
to put in at that intersection they had
 
00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
to widen it enough to put in a bicycle
 
00:53:16.549 --> 00:53:16.559 align:start position:0%
lane going both ways that would
 
00:53:18.770 --> 00:53:18.780 align:start position:0%
certainly end as soon as the widening of
 
00:53:21.410 --> 00:53:21.420 align:start position:0%
this intersection was done so that they
 
00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:23.460 align:start position:0%
thought why are we putting in a bicycle
 
00:53:25.609 --> 00:53:25.619 align:start position:0%
lane that is going nowhere it ends
 
00:53:27.890 --> 00:53:27.900 align:start position:0%
literally 100 feet on either side of
 
00:53:29.210 --> 00:53:29.220 align:start position:0%
this um
 
00:53:31.970 --> 00:53:31.980 align:start position:0%
intersection so they they explained to
 
00:53:33.890 --> 00:53:33.900 align:start position:0%
us that they use it as a practical
 
00:53:36.049 --> 00:53:36.059 align:start position:0%
guideline anytime they're rebuilding
 
00:53:39.170 --> 00:53:39.180 align:start position:0%
something when they want to do uh exit
 
00:53:42.530 --> 00:53:42.540 align:start position:0%
4A in Dairy they went to Dairy and found
 
00:53:45.290 --> 00:53:45.300 align:start position:0%
out that their streets in downtown Dairy
 
00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
aren't even wide enough
 
00:53:51.470 --> 00:53:51.480 align:start position:0%
to try and put in this this complete
 
00:53:53.450 --> 00:53:53.460 align:start position:0%
streets programs without knocking down
 
00:53:56.089 --> 00:53:56.099 align:start position:0%
buildings so the D.O.T is very very
 
00:53:59.210 --> 00:53:59.220 align:start position:0%
aware of the program when practical they
 
00:54:01.730 --> 00:54:01.740 align:start position:0%
they try and utilize every concept of it
 
00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:04.380 align:start position:0%
but to make this mandatory on everything
 
00:54:06.349 --> 00:54:06.359 align:start position:0%
just makes no sense
 
00:54:08.510 --> 00:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair any further
 
00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:10.670 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair any further
discussion

00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:54:13.490 --> 00:54:13.500 align:start position:0%
before we before we call the roll on
 
00:54:16.490 --> 00:54:16.500 align:start position:0%
this I I do want to make mention of two
 
00:54:18.530 --> 00:54:18.540 align:start position:0%
things number one the amount of time
 
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
that Roshan Mills had put into this
 
00:54:22.849 --> 00:54:22.859 align:start position:0%
project prior to
 
00:54:25.790 --> 00:54:25.800 align:start position:0%
um and the time that uh Vice chairman uh
 
00:54:27.589 --> 00:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
Cloutier has put in to get you
 
00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
background information on this I have
 
00:54:32.690 --> 00:54:32.700 align:start position:0%
always been a fan I served on that that
 
00:54:34.970 --> 00:54:34.980 align:start position:0%
I think that this is the right way to
 
00:54:34.980 --> 00:54:36.490 align:start position:0%
I think that this is the right way to
engineer

00:54:36.490 --> 00:54:36.500 align:start position:0%
engineer
 
00:54:40.329 --> 00:54:40.339 align:start position:0%
roads when we can and we can afford
 
00:54:42.890 --> 00:54:42.900 align:start position:0%
pedestrian bicycle movements and so
 
00:54:45.650 --> 00:54:45.660 align:start position:0%
forth so but unfortunately I believe
 
00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
this we don't have enough money now to
 
00:54:50.569 --> 00:54:50.579 align:start position:0%
pay for what we have for roads and
 
00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
bridges and we're not quite ready for
 
00:54:56.569 --> 00:54:56.579 align:start position:0%
this so with that seeing no further
 
00:54:59.930 --> 00:54:59.940 align:start position:0%
discussion if you're in favor
 
00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:02.700 align:start position:0%
of the motion which is itl for House
 
00:55:06.349 --> 00:55:06.359 align:start position:0%
Bill 511 FN relative to requiring the
 
00:55:08.569 --> 00:55:08.579 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation to do road
 
00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
maintenance and repairs according to its
 
00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
complete streets program if you're in
 
00:55:16.069 --> 00:55:16.079 align:start position:0%
favor of the motion itl you would
 
00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:18.180 align:start position:0%
signify by saying I if you're opposed
 
00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
it'll be nay and the clerk will call the
 
00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:22.250 align:start position:0%
it'll be nay and the clerk will call the

00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
clerk the nice to see our numbers are
 
00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
growing we picked up a couple here yes
 
00:56:24.829 --> 00:56:24.839 align:start position:0%
and that's going to be on the regular
 
00:56:29.930 --> 00:56:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:33.950 --> 00:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
that concludes our our executive session
 
00:56:36.170 --> 00:56:36.180 align:start position:0%
for today and I believe that concludes
 
00:56:38.750 --> 00:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
all the bills other than House Bill 25
 
00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:40.680 align:start position:0%
that have been before us
 
00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
I um I appreciate the ability of the
 
00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:46.079 align:start position:0%
committee to work together and and to
 
00:56:48.349 --> 00:56:48.359 align:start position:0%
bring us to this point so I thank you
 
00:56:50.089 --> 00:56:50.099 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:56:52.309 --> 00:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately I have a scheduling
 
00:56:55.609 --> 00:56:55.619 align:start position:0%
debacle here that we will uh we will not
 
00:56:58.250 --> 00:56:58.260 align:start position:0%
be able to discuss House Bill 25 until
 
00:57:01.490 --> 00:57:01.500 align:start position:0%
one o'clock today so I sincerely
 
00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
apologize for that and hoping that a
 
00:57:05.569 --> 00:57:05.579 align:start position:0%
couple of the other members will have
 
00:57:08.569 --> 00:57:08.579 align:start position:0%
time to shovel their way to Concord
 
00:57:11.210 --> 00:57:11.220 align:start position:0%
before then so
 
00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
um we will we will be in recess until uh
 
00:57:16.270 --> 00:57:16.280 align:start position:0%
1 pm
 
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
my my
 
00:57:21.890 --> 00:57:21.900 align:start position:0%
goal here is that we will open up House
 
00:57:25.609 --> 00:57:25.619 align:start position:0%
Bill uh House Bill 25 and start running
 
00:57:28.549 --> 00:57:28.559 align:start position:0%
down from the top to the bottom uh
 
00:57:31.549 --> 00:57:31.559 align:start position:0%
finding areas that we can find agreement
 
00:57:31.559 --> 00:57:33.010 align:start position:0%
finding areas that we can find agreement
on

00:57:33.010 --> 00:57:33.020 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:57:35.930 --> 00:57:35.940 align:start position:0%
areas that might need an amendment will
 
00:57:38.690 --> 00:57:38.700 align:start position:0%
make mention of which will give Chris
 
00:57:41.870 --> 00:57:41.880 align:start position:0%
time to do that Drafting and when we
 
00:57:44.750 --> 00:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
start you will be uh you'll have a full
 
00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
listing of monies that have lapsed and
 
00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
other monies that this committee will
 
00:57:53.930 --> 00:57:53.940 align:start position:0%
have available to us to uh reappropriate
 
00:57:56.990 --> 00:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
for other projects so with that unless
 
00:57:59.089 --> 00:57:59.099 align:start position:0%
you have questions for myself as the
 
00:58:01.849 --> 00:58:01.859 align:start position:0%
chair we will be in recess till one
 
00:58:03.650 --> 00:58:03.660 align:start position:0%
o'clock and I apologize for that
 
00:58:15.490 --> 00:58:15.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:21.849 align:start position:0%
 
tomorrow

00:58:21.849 --> 00:58:21.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:25.010 --> 00:58:25.020 align:start position:0%
there you go
 
00:58:25.020 --> 00:58:32.770 align:start position:0%
there you go
tomorrow

00:58:32.770 --> 00:58:32.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
you know we only have one billion except
 
00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
that that's going to that state on
 
03:07:18.769 --> 03:07:18.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:18.779 --> 03:07:20.090 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:07:20.090 --> 03:07:20.100 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:07:22.070 --> 03:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
03:07:25.610 --> 03:07:25.620 align:start position:0%
um we now will start in on House Bill 25
 
03:07:29.210 --> 03:07:29.220 align:start position:0%
is amended for the new members I know
 
03:07:31.490 --> 03:07:31.500 align:start position:0%
we've highlighted this before but I
 
03:07:34.490 --> 03:07:34.500 align:start position:0%
would like to go there one more time
 
03:07:38.990 --> 03:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
um this this bill is our culmination of
 
03:07:42.469 --> 03:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
what we are here to do next year we'll
 
03:07:45.050 --> 03:07:45.060 align:start position:0%
be talking the 10-year plan
 
03:07:48.469 --> 03:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
our intent is that we will go through
 
03:07:50.990 --> 03:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
find agreement I think we'll have time
 
03:07:53.330 --> 03:07:53.340 align:start position:0%
anyways then to talk about other items
 
03:07:56.570 --> 03:07:56.580 align:start position:0%
into this budget uh Friday we're hoping
 
03:07:59.210 --> 03:07:59.220 align:start position:0%
to come together and reach a consensus
 
03:08:02.269 --> 03:08:02.279 align:start position:0%
if we can have any amendments drafted
 
03:08:06.950 --> 03:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
that needed to be drafted with a goal of
 
03:08:06.960 --> 03:08:08.530 align:start position:0%
that needed to be drafted with a goal of
Monday

03:08:08.530 --> 03:08:08.540 align:start position:0%
Monday
 
03:08:10.910 --> 03:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
reporting this out and if it doesn't
 
03:08:13.610 --> 03:08:13.620 align:start position:0%
happen on Monday we we have time if
 
03:08:15.530 --> 03:08:15.540 align:start position:0%
there's amendments and so forth for that
 
03:08:18.650 --> 03:08:18.660 align:start position:0%
so I would like to recognize Christopher
 
03:08:19.929 --> 03:08:19.939 align:start position:0%
Shea first
 
03:08:22.370 --> 03:08:22.380 align:start position:0%
describe some of these documents in
 
03:08:25.309 --> 03:08:25.319 align:start position:0%
front of you and if I could please
 
03:08:26.809 --> 03:08:26.819 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair for the record
 
03:08:29.750 --> 03:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
crochet from the LBA I passed out three
 
03:08:31.910 --> 03:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
documents one before lunch and then two
 
03:08:35.870 --> 03:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
after lunch the first document is House
 
03:08:38.330 --> 03:08:38.340 align:start position:0%
Bill 25 compare report so it's a
 
03:08:40.370 --> 03:08:40.380 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet report
 
03:08:43.250 --> 03:08:43.260 align:start position:0%
that is all the information from the
 
03:08:46.130 --> 03:08:46.140 align:start position:0%
bill itself just put in an Excel file
 
03:08:47.510 --> 03:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
for you to follow along to make it a
 
03:08:48.650 --> 03:08:48.660 align:start position:0%
little bit easier to look at the
 
03:08:50.809 --> 03:08:50.819 align:start position:0%
projects as you as you are discussing
 
03:08:50.819 --> 03:08:53.510 align:start position:0%
projects as you as you are discussing
them

03:08:53.510 --> 03:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:55.130 --> 03:08:55.140 align:start position:0%
the long sheet that looks kind of
 
03:08:57.889 --> 03:08:57.899 align:start position:0%
similar was just a way that I was trying
 
03:09:00.889 --> 03:09:00.899 align:start position:0%
to compile all the agency asks
 
03:09:03.830 --> 03:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
in one on one sheet so it's a two-sided
 
03:09:03.840 --> 03:09:04.730 align:start position:0%
in one on one sheet so it's a two-sided
sheet

03:09:04.730 --> 03:09:04.740 align:start position:0%
sheet
 
03:09:06.590 --> 03:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
so if you get to administrative services
 
03:09:08.330 --> 03:09:08.340 align:start position:0%
and you're having a conversation and
 
03:09:09.889 --> 03:09:09.899 align:start position:0%
you're like I think they asked for
 
03:09:11.690 --> 03:09:11.700 align:start position:0%
something at the haze and drive if you
 
03:09:12.889 --> 03:09:12.899 align:start position:0%
look at that you'll see that they ask
 
03:09:15.170 --> 03:09:15.180 align:start position:0%
for two chillers at a cost of three
 
03:09:17.870 --> 03:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars at Hazen Drive
 
03:09:20.269 --> 03:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
on both those documents you have a
 
03:09:23.870 --> 03:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
column B which is the fund
 
03:09:26.510 --> 03:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
if it says BG that means general funds
 
03:09:29.090 --> 03:09:29.100 align:start position:0%
that's bonding General if it says Bo
 
03:09:31.130 --> 03:09:31.140 align:start position:0%
that's bonding other
 
03:09:32.510 --> 03:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
so it would be a source of funds that
 
03:09:34.070 --> 03:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
the agencies identified that would pay
 
03:09:36.290 --> 03:09:36.300 align:start position:0%
for the project and then if it's Federal
 
03:09:38.510 --> 03:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
you'll see an F
 
03:09:40.610 --> 03:09:40.620 align:start position:0%
and then if it's Highway you would see
 
03:09:45.710 --> 03:09:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:47.990 --> 03:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
the last document I passed out was a
 
03:09:50.929 --> 03:09:50.939 align:start position:0%
packet of six six pages it's um what I
 
03:09:52.250 --> 03:09:52.260 align:start position:0%
would refer to as friendly amendments
 
03:09:54.290 --> 03:09:54.300 align:start position:0%
with reps of McConkey and repsum Jack's
 
03:09:56.330 --> 03:09:56.340 align:start position:0%
name on it some of these came about from
 
03:09:58.010 --> 03:09:58.020 align:start position:0%
the lapse extension review some of it
 
03:10:01.130 --> 03:10:01.140 align:start position:0%
was requested agencies made of this
 
03:10:02.870 --> 03:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
committee when they were presenting
 
03:10:05.150 --> 03:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
these requests are things such as
 
03:10:07.550 --> 03:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
changing a project name or moving a
 
03:10:10.490 --> 03:10:10.500 align:start position:0%
project from one agency to another none
 
03:10:11.929 --> 03:10:11.939 align:start position:0%
of these projects or none of these
 
03:10:14.750 --> 03:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
amendments impact the dollars per se
 
03:10:17.210 --> 03:10:17.220 align:start position:0%
it's just changing the focus or the
 
03:10:20.330 --> 03:10:20.340 align:start position:0%
scope of a project or again moving it
 
03:10:22.010 --> 03:10:22.020 align:start position:0%
so that's all I had just just want to
 
03:10:23.269 --> 03:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
make sure the members knew what was
 
03:10:25.550 --> 03:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
before them as the representative Jack I
 
03:10:28.670 --> 03:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
guess is going to present his um lapse
 
03:10:38.030 --> 03:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:39.889 --> 03:10:39.899 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:10:42.050 --> 03:10:42.060 align:start position:0%
and if you can believe for a third time
 
03:10:44.450 --> 03:10:44.460 align:start position:0%
I've lost that document which one you
 
03:10:46.370 --> 03:10:46.380 align:start position:0%
don't have two of those that right there
 
03:10:48.769 --> 03:10:48.779 align:start position:0%
do you John I don't but if you want I
 
03:10:51.490 --> 03:10:51.500 align:start position:0%
can okay we'll just let's put there
 
03:10:54.290 --> 03:10:54.300 align:start position:0%
oh right there thank you that's the one
 
03:10:56.750 --> 03:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
found it for the third time
 
03:10:58.550 --> 03:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative Jack
 
03:11:01.610 --> 03:11:01.620 align:start position:0%
would you please uh take us through the
 
03:11:05.150 --> 03:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
uh the work your uh lapse committee had
 
03:11:07.309 --> 03:11:07.319 align:start position:0%
performed for us please uh thank you Mr
 
03:11:10.250 --> 03:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
chairman on Monday we held a
 
03:11:12.769 --> 03:11:12.779 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work session we had seven
 
03:11:15.410 --> 03:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
agents we did same time uh the same way
 
03:11:18.469 --> 03:11:18.479 align:start position:0%
we do it every time the agencies that
 
03:11:21.410 --> 03:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
have a small number we Handle by email
 
03:11:24.410 --> 03:11:24.420 align:start position:0%
uh and ask them if their lapse
 
03:11:27.290 --> 03:11:27.300 align:start position:0%
extensions are correct and the larger
 
03:11:31.070 --> 03:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
agencies we have in to present uh I
 
03:11:34.309 --> 03:11:34.319 align:start position:0%
passed out a report it's it's one page
 
03:11:34.319 --> 03:11:35.690 align:start position:0%
passed out a report it's it's one page
double-sided

03:11:35.690 --> 03:11:35.700 align:start position:0%
double-sided
 
03:11:39.349 --> 03:11:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh every time the the one one remark I
 
03:11:42.410 --> 03:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
would make is there is at least twice as
 
03:11:43.910 --> 03:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
much activity
 
03:11:46.490 --> 03:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
on the lap subcommittee as there is in a
 
03:11:50.110 --> 03:11:50.120 align:start position:0%
normal cycle that includes items where
 
03:11:53.150 --> 03:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
the agency has decided that they can
 
03:11:55.130 --> 03:11:55.140 align:start position:0%
lapse the funds they no longer need them
 
03:11:55.140 --> 03:11:56.330 align:start position:0%
lapse the funds they no longer need them
extended

03:11:56.330 --> 03:11:56.340 align:start position:0%
extended
 
03:11:59.090 --> 03:11:59.100 align:start position:0%
uh so you'll see lines where we're going
 
03:12:02.150 --> 03:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
to delete those lines and that frees up
 
03:12:04.670 --> 03:12:04.680 align:start position:0%
funds that we can repurpose for another
 
03:12:07.309 --> 03:12:07.319 align:start position:0%
project you'll see
 
03:12:10.730 --> 03:12:10.740 align:start position:0%
items where we want to add that is
 
03:12:13.429 --> 03:12:13.439 align:start position:0%
an item that the agency
 
03:12:16.490 --> 03:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
has decided is not in House Bill 25 and
 
03:12:19.070 --> 03:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
they need to extend the appropriation
 
03:12:21.590 --> 03:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
the reason being if it's not in House
 
03:12:23.750 --> 03:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
Bill 25 in the extension section the
 
03:12:26.450 --> 03:12:26.460 align:start position:0%
funds will lapse on June 30th and they
 
03:12:28.309 --> 03:12:28.319 align:start position:0%
can no longer expend them
 
03:12:30.410 --> 03:12:30.420 align:start position:0%
on the project that they're appropriated
 
03:12:32.269 --> 03:12:32.279 align:start position:0%
for so they could get in a situation
 
03:12:34.670 --> 03:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
where they can't pay a bill on a
 
03:12:36.050 --> 03:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
contract that they've already awarded
 
03:12:38.929 --> 03:12:38.939 align:start position:0%
because the funds have lapsed and then
 
03:12:41.389 --> 03:12:41.399 align:start position:0%
the other thing that we
 
03:12:44.450 --> 03:12:44.460 align:start position:0%
that we take is information on when they
 
03:12:46.849 --> 03:12:46.859 align:start position:0%
want to change the purpose of an
 
03:12:46.859 --> 03:12:48.070 align:start position:0%
want to change the purpose of an
appropriation

03:12:48.070 --> 03:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
03:12:50.630 --> 03:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
uh for example
 
03:12:50.640 --> 03:12:52.130 align:start position:0%
uh for example
uh

03:12:52.130 --> 03:12:52.140 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:12:53.750 --> 03:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
fishing game
 
03:12:56.750 --> 03:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to change they had an
 
03:12:58.910 --> 03:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
appropriation that was applicable only
 
03:13:01.309 --> 03:13:01.319 align:start position:0%
to the Powder Mill Hatchery and they
 
03:13:03.349 --> 03:13:03.359 align:start position:0%
wanted to use some of the funds on other
 
03:13:05.929 --> 03:13:05.939 align:start position:0%
hatcheries in the state so they asked us
 
03:13:08.750 --> 03:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
if we would change the title of the
 
03:13:11.210 --> 03:13:11.220 align:start position:0%
appropriation to include all of the work
 
03:13:12.830 --> 03:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
that they wanted to do those are on the
 
03:13:13.790 --> 03:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
back side
 
03:13:17.269 --> 03:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
and you'll also find them
 
03:13:21.110 --> 03:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
in the in the document that Mr Shea put
 
03:13:24.050 --> 03:13:24.060 align:start position:0%
out for additional agency requests and
 
03:13:26.330 --> 03:13:26.340 align:start position:0%
you'll find them in the in the amendment
 
03:13:28.910 --> 03:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
packet so if there's any questions I'm
 
03:13:31.849 --> 03:13:31.859 align:start position:0%

03:14:04.510 --> 03:14:04.520 align:start position:0%
work that Jack put into this was just
 
03:14:08.870 --> 03:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
beyond incredible that uh how he ran the
 
03:14:11.450 --> 03:14:11.460 align:start position:0%
meeting and how the information was
 
03:14:15.349 --> 03:14:15.359 align:start position:0%
provided to someone as new as me I
 
03:14:18.349 --> 03:14:18.359 align:start position:0%

conclusion it was nice to hear a new
 
03:14:27.349 --> 03:14:27.359 align:start position:0%
member and we did bring in two new
 
03:14:30.110 --> 03:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
members specifically uh representative
 
03:14:33.050 --> 03:14:33.060 align:start position:0%
Juris and yourself so that we could you
 
03:14:34.849 --> 03:14:34.859 align:start position:0%
could be a part of that in the learning
 
03:14:37.429 --> 03:14:37.439 align:start position:0%
process so it's invaluable
 
03:14:39.230 --> 03:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
representative Jack has done this at
 
03:14:40.990 --> 03:14:41.000 align:start position:0%
least two terms
 
03:14:45.590 --> 03:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
so very thankful for that and and
 
03:14:50.530 --> 03:14:50.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:56.690 --> 03:14:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:56.700 --> 03:14:57.410 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:14:57.410 --> 03:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:15:01.429 --> 03:15:01.439 align:start position:0%
we have this package of of uh the uh
 
03:15:04.849 --> 03:15:04.859 align:start position:0%
unapproved amendments uh that uh
 
03:15:08.510 --> 03:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
Mr Shea gave us I think we should take
 
03:15:11.750 --> 03:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
these as a one by one tonight the intent
 
03:15:14.269 --> 03:15:14.279 align:start position:0%
today is to do a number of straw polls
 
03:15:16.309 --> 03:15:16.319 align:start position:0%
they're not binding we don't have to
 
03:15:18.469 --> 03:15:18.479 align:start position:0%
record anything we just need to figure
 
03:15:20.570 --> 03:15:20.580 align:start position:0%
out whether or not these will meet with
 
03:15:22.670 --> 03:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
everybody's approval and that we can
 
03:15:24.590 --> 03:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
move on to the next step
 
03:15:26.929 --> 03:15:26.939 align:start position:0%
and get them finalized so that they've
 
03:15:29.510 --> 03:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
become real amendments this entire
 
03:15:31.849 --> 03:15:31.859 align:start position:0%
package that we got
 
03:15:35.269 --> 03:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
has no change in any dollar figures
 
03:15:37.130 --> 03:15:37.140 align:start position:0%
these are all these are all the
 
03:15:38.870 --> 03:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
mechanical things that have to be done
 
03:15:42.050 --> 03:15:42.060 align:start position:0%
for instance as representative Jack said
 
03:15:43.790 --> 03:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
about the fishery
 
03:15:47.389 --> 03:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
the changing the the title of it that
 
03:15:49.130 --> 03:15:49.140 align:start position:0%
has to be a separate Amendment and
 
03:15:51.769 --> 03:15:51.779 align:start position:0%
that's in this package so we'd like to
 
03:15:53.990 --> 03:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
go through these one by one
 
03:15:55.790 --> 03:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
seeing if they meet with everybody's
 
03:15:57.889 --> 03:15:57.899 align:start position:0%
approval just do a straw poll on this
 
03:16:00.349 --> 03:16:00.359 align:start position:0%
and that way we can that that way we've
 
03:16:02.389 --> 03:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
got actual figures that we can move
 
03:16:06.650 --> 03:16:06.660 align:start position:0%
ahead with if everybody understands that
 
03:16:08.929 --> 03:16:08.939 align:start position:0%
any questions anybody have any questions
 
03:16:10.190 --> 03:16:10.200 align:start position:0%
on that
 
03:16:12.590 --> 03:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
Chris are you okay with our format of
 
03:16:13.610 --> 03:16:13.620 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
03:16:15.349 --> 03:16:15.359 align:start position:0%
I am and would you like me to walk the
 
03:16:16.849 --> 03:16:16.859 align:start position:0%
committee through each of the Amendments
 
03:16:20.510 --> 03:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
yes thank you to be my next guy my next
 
03:16:20.520 --> 03:16:22.130 align:start position:0%
yes thank you to be my next guy my next
statement

03:16:22.130 --> 03:16:22.140 align:start position:0%
statement
 
03:16:26.389 --> 03:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
so we'll start with Amendment 1003h
 
03:16:28.130 --> 03:16:28.140 align:start position:0%
this was a request from administrative
 
03:16:29.990 --> 03:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
Services it came to the capital budget
 
03:16:31.550 --> 03:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
overview committee
 
03:16:31.560 --> 03:16:32.210 align:start position:0%
overview committee
um

03:16:32.210 --> 03:16:32.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:36.469 --> 03:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
last Friday I handed out a document
 
03:16:38.330 --> 03:16:38.340 align:start position:0%
that same day to this full committee
 
03:16:40.490 --> 03:16:40.500 align:start position:0%
where the request was to transfer a
 
03:16:43.250 --> 03:16:43.260 align:start position:0%
project for the Philbrook sewer line
 
03:16:43.260 --> 03:16:44.690 align:start position:0%
project for the Philbrook sewer line
replacement

03:16:44.690 --> 03:16:44.700 align:start position:0%
replacement
 
03:16:46.309 --> 03:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
from Department of administrative
 
03:16:48.050 --> 03:16:48.060 align:start position:0%
services to the Department of Health and
 
03:16:50.210 --> 03:16:50.220 align:start position:0%
Human Services the reason for the
 
03:16:52.309 --> 03:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
requested change is that building's use
 
03:16:53.990 --> 03:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
has changed from being an office
 
03:16:57.110 --> 03:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
building and is now a facility to house
 
03:16:59.389 --> 03:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
individuals which is the under the
 
03:17:02.030 --> 03:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
purview of Health and Human Services
 
03:17:03.830 --> 03:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
it doesn't change the value of the
 
03:17:07.130 --> 03:17:07.140 align:start position:0%
project or the process of the project
 
03:17:11.750 --> 03:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:13.370 --> 03:17:13.380 align:start position:0%
and I'll just keep moving forward unless
 
03:17:16.070 --> 03:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
somebody wants to ask me a question
 
03:17:18.550 --> 03:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
the next page is amendment
 
03:17:21.590 --> 03:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
1009h it's a second request from the
 
03:17:23.050 --> 03:17:23.060 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative services
 
03:17:25.969 --> 03:17:25.979 align:start position:0%
this is a request that came in during
 
03:17:28.330 --> 03:17:28.340 align:start position:0%
the lapse extension review I believe
 
03:17:32.510 --> 03:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
but it's to rename a roof replacement
 
03:17:32.520 --> 03:17:34.370 align:start position:0%
but it's to rename a roof replacement
project

03:17:34.370 --> 03:17:34.380 align:start position:0%
project
 
03:17:35.870 --> 03:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
um from Peasley Wing to the North
 
03:17:38.030 --> 03:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
Pavilion Wing the department of
 
03:17:39.710 --> 03:17:39.720 align:start position:0%
administrative Services has determined
 
03:17:42.530 --> 03:17:42.540 align:start position:0%
that the Peasley wing of the main
 
03:17:44.690 --> 03:17:44.700 align:start position:0%
building is not
 
03:17:46.969 --> 03:17:46.979 align:start position:0%
um salvageable and they have no
 
03:17:48.410 --> 03:17:48.420 align:start position:0%
intention of continuing to put money
 
03:17:50.929 --> 03:17:50.939 align:start position:0%
into it in fact at some point I think
 
03:17:53.330 --> 03:17:53.340 align:start position:0%
there's some going to be an effort to
 
03:17:56.630 --> 03:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
maybe remove that piece of the building
 
03:18:00.710 --> 03:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
if if members have questions any of
 
03:18:03.469 --> 03:18:03.479 align:start position:0%
these amendments please raise them as we
 
03:18:07.550 --> 03:18:07.560 align:start position:0%
go through otherwise we will we will do
 
03:18:10.309 --> 03:18:10.319 align:start position:0%
a straw poll at the end unless you want
 
03:18:12.650 --> 03:18:12.660 align:start position:0%
to go individually yes representative
 
03:18:15.050 --> 03:18:15.060 align:start position:0%
Jack thank you can I just make one this
 
03:18:17.510 --> 03:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
is a little piece of inside baseball if
 
03:18:20.150 --> 03:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
you look at line three you'll notice
 
03:18:23.090 --> 03:18:23.100 align:start position:0%
we're amending the capital budget from
 
03:18:23.100 --> 03:18:25.269 align:start position:0%
we're amending the capital budget from
2017.

03:18:25.269 --> 03:18:25.279 align:start position:0%
2017.
 
03:18:30.410 --> 03:18:30.420 align:start position:0%
to amend the purpose in 2017
 
03:18:32.389 --> 03:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
because that's what we have to do all go
 
03:18:33.410 --> 03:18:33.420 align:start position:0%
all the way back to the original
 
03:18:36.769 --> 03:18:36.779 align:start position:0%
appropriation and amend that and then
 
03:18:39.950 --> 03:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
modify all the lapse extensions
 
03:18:43.429 --> 03:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
so the part in line 12
 
03:18:43.439 --> 03:18:44.690 align:start position:0%
so the part in line 12
uh

03:18:44.690 --> 03:18:44.700 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:18:47.929 --> 03:18:47.939 align:start position:0%
will will amend
 
03:18:52.429 --> 03:18:52.439 align:start position:0%
the the lapse extension
 
03:18:54.889 --> 03:18:54.899 align:start position:0%
to to the new language
 
03:18:56.870 --> 03:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely correct so if you
 
03:18:59.750 --> 03:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
actually look at line 13
 
03:19:02.030 --> 03:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
um it reads
 
03:19:04.490 --> 03:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
near the end as amended by this act so
 
03:19:05.929 --> 03:19:05.939 align:start position:0%
that's basically we're going to refer to
 
03:19:08.630 --> 03:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
the section 12 that amends the previous
 
03:19:10.910 --> 03:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
chapter excuse me the previous uh
 
03:19:10.920 --> 03:19:12.230 align:start position:0%
chapter excuse me the previous uh
statute

03:19:12.230 --> 03:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
statute
 
03:19:12.240 --> 03:19:13.969 align:start position:0%
statute
okay

03:19:13.969 --> 03:19:13.979 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:19:16.490 --> 03:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
is everyone okay with the first two
 
03:19:18.349 --> 03:19:18.359 align:start position:0%
please continue
 
03:19:20.929 --> 03:19:20.939 align:start position:0%
moving to the third item which is one
 
03:19:23.809 --> 03:19:23.819 align:start position:0%
zero zero four h that's a request from
 
03:19:25.790 --> 03:19:25.800 align:start position:0%
The Fish and Game Commission
 
03:19:29.030 --> 03:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
they had an appropriation for the Powder
 
03:19:31.130 --> 03:19:31.140 align:start position:0%
Mill Fish Hatchery of 4.6 million
 
03:19:31.140 --> 03:19:32.990 align:start position:0%
Mill Fish Hatchery of 4.6 million
dollars

03:19:32.990 --> 03:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:19:33.000 --> 03:19:33.830 align:start position:0%
dollars
um

03:19:33.830 --> 03:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:36.110 --> 03:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
and I think I think the director might
 
03:19:37.309 --> 03:19:37.319 align:start position:0%
have talked about it when he was here
 
03:19:39.290 --> 03:19:39.300 align:start position:0%
but there were part of the reason for
 
03:19:41.690 --> 03:19:41.700 align:start position:0%
that appropriation in the last capital
 
03:19:43.550 --> 03:19:43.560 align:start position:0%
budget is that there were some
 
03:19:45.410 --> 03:19:45.420 align:start position:0%
environmental issues and they were being
 
03:19:45.420 --> 03:19:46.010 align:start position:0%
environmental issues and they were being
um

03:19:46.010 --> 03:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:47.990 --> 03:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
pressured to get some things completed
 
03:19:48.000 --> 03:19:48.830 align:start position:0%
pressured to get some things completed
there

03:19:48.830 --> 03:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:19:51.230 --> 03:19:51.240 align:start position:0%
with the arpa money Fish and Game
 
03:19:55.010 --> 03:19:55.020 align:start position:0%
Commission was provided another 58 I
 
03:19:57.769 --> 03:19:57.779 align:start position:0%
think it's 58 million dollars of arpa
 
03:20:00.590 --> 03:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
funds to renovate hatcheries Statewide
 
03:20:02.570 --> 03:20:02.580 align:start position:0%
and they're in the process of putting
 
03:20:04.309 --> 03:20:04.319 align:start position:0%
their Statewide plan together on how
 
03:20:06.410 --> 03:20:06.420 align:start position:0%
they want to move forward with that so
 
03:20:09.590 --> 03:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
their request was to add this money to
 
03:20:11.389 --> 03:20:11.399 align:start position:0%
the money that they they have for arpa
 
03:20:13.130 --> 03:20:13.140 align:start position:0%
and as they put their plan together and
 
03:20:14.389 --> 03:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
determine how they want to handle the
 
03:20:15.950 --> 03:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
hatcheries they'd be able to have a
 
03:20:18.469 --> 03:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
approximately 62 million to almost 63
 
03:20:21.830 --> 03:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
million dollars for that purpose
 
03:20:24.050 --> 03:20:24.060 align:start position:0%
if we if we could pause here represent
 
03:20:26.210 --> 03:20:26.220 align:start position:0%
Newton we had we had spoken earlier
 
03:20:27.950 --> 03:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
about this project
 
03:20:32.090 --> 03:20:32.100 align:start position:0%
yes address it yeah I have a concern
 
03:20:34.070 --> 03:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
with this because of the way I read it
 
03:20:37.370 --> 03:20:37.380 align:start position:0%
it's taking the four million 615
 
03:20:40.190 --> 03:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
000 kind of moving it around out of the
 
03:20:44.090 --> 03:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
Powder Mill Hatchery if we've got that
 
03:20:46.969 --> 03:20:46.979 align:start position:0%
much money in there from Oppa where is
 
03:20:50.230 --> 03:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
the urgency to take this for
 
03:20:53.510 --> 03:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
0.615 million out when we were told to
 
03:20:56.450 --> 03:20:56.460 align:start position:0%
get it in the first place how it was
 
03:21:00.170 --> 03:21:00.180 align:start position:0%
urgent that we update the Powder Mill
 
03:21:02.330 --> 03:21:02.340 align:start position:0%
Hatchery because of the affluent that is
 
03:21:04.070 --> 03:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
going into the river causing algae
 
03:21:07.190 --> 03:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
blooms that is then eventually that
 
03:21:09.769 --> 03:21:09.779 align:start position:0%
river goes into one of usaki and I did
 
03:21:11.990 --> 03:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
read something recently where the EPA is
 
03:21:13.969 --> 03:21:13.979 align:start position:0%
getting even more stringent
 
03:21:16.309 --> 03:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
with what's happening in that area so
 
03:21:18.230 --> 03:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
why if there's that much other money
 
03:21:19.790 --> 03:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
there why would we
 
03:21:22.070 --> 03:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
direct this 4 million six hundred
 
03:21:24.290 --> 03:21:24.300 align:start position:0%
fifteen thousand someplace else went as
 
03:21:26.210 --> 03:21:26.220 align:start position:0%
far as I know nothing's been done there
 
03:21:28.910 --> 03:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
to date
 
03:21:31.010 --> 03:21:31.020 align:start position:0%
So based on the testimony from the
 
03:21:31.020 --> 03:21:32.269 align:start position:0%
So based on the testimony from the
director

03:21:32.269 --> 03:21:32.279 align:start position:0%
director
 
03:21:34.370 --> 03:21:34.380 align:start position:0%
they're in the process of putting their
 
03:21:35.929 --> 03:21:35.939 align:start position:0%
Statewide plan together for all the
 
03:21:38.090 --> 03:21:38.100 align:start position:0%
hatcheries and they are still
 
03:21:40.790 --> 03:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
identifying what purpose each Hatchery
 
03:21:42.650 --> 03:21:42.660 align:start position:0%
will have and if it will stay the same
 
03:21:45.530 --> 03:21:45.540 align:start position:0%
size be Consolidated down or maybe be
 
03:21:47.349 --> 03:21:47.359 align:start position:0%
closed and move somewhere else
 
03:21:50.150 --> 03:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
so that that was his testimony when he
 
03:21:52.130 --> 03:21:52.140 align:start position:0%
was before this committee your concern
 
03:21:53.389 --> 03:21:53.399 align:start position:0%
is that there there's already some
 
03:21:55.429 --> 03:21:55.439 align:start position:0%
issues occurring there
 
03:21:58.070 --> 03:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
um and you would like them to still have
 
03:21:59.690 --> 03:21:59.700 align:start position:0%
you would like them to try to use this
 
03:22:01.550 --> 03:22:01.560 align:start position:0%
money there first before they'd used it
 
03:22:03.170 --> 03:22:03.180 align:start position:0%
anywhere else in the state to address
 
03:22:05.389 --> 03:22:05.399 align:start position:0%
their problems what I'm hearing yeah
 
03:22:09.050 --> 03:22:09.060 align:start position:0%
well again they when they came to us a
 
03:22:11.269 --> 03:22:11.279 align:start position:0%
year or two ago the urgency was to do
 
03:22:12.650 --> 03:22:12.660 align:start position:0%
something there
 
03:22:14.690 --> 03:22:14.700 align:start position:0%
and the Powder Mill Hatchery has already
 
03:22:17.570 --> 03:22:17.580 align:start position:0%
given the lot up they no longer raise
 
03:22:19.550 --> 03:22:19.560 align:start position:0%
salmon there because of the effluent
 
03:22:21.830 --> 03:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
that's going out and it doesn't make a
 
03:22:23.330 --> 03:22:23.340 align:start position:0%
lot of sense because the Powder Mill
 
03:22:25.550 --> 03:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
Hatchery used to get the salmon right
 
03:22:27.230 --> 03:22:27.240 align:start position:0%
from Winnipesaukee which is a stone
 
03:22:30.110 --> 03:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
throw away excuse me by mayor meeting
 
03:22:32.929 --> 03:22:32.939 align:start position:0%
Lake which is a Stones throw away in the
 
03:22:32.939 --> 03:22:33.969 align:start position:0%
Lake which is a Stones throw away in the
Hatchery

03:22:33.969 --> 03:22:33.979 align:start position:0%
Hatchery
 
03:22:37.610 --> 03:22:37.620 align:start position:0%
serves most of the Seacoast with the
 
03:22:40.070 --> 03:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
stocking program that they have and
 
03:22:42.050 --> 03:22:42.060 align:start position:0%
what's unique about this Hatchery is
 
03:22:45.110 --> 03:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
there's two inlets for the Hatchery out
 
03:22:46.670 --> 03:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
of marinating Lake which is one of the
 
03:22:49.010 --> 03:22:49.020 align:start position:0%
cleanest lakes in the state
 
03:22:51.410 --> 03:22:51.420 align:start position:0%
and they can draw the water into the
 
03:22:54.290 --> 03:22:54.300 align:start position:0%
Hatchery from the top of the lake when
 
03:22:54.300 --> 03:22:55.309 align:start position:0%
Hatchery from the top of the lake when
the

03:22:55.309 --> 03:22:55.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:22:58.309 --> 03:22:58.319 align:start position:0%
temperature best suits raising of trout
 
03:23:00.410 --> 03:23:00.420 align:start position:0%
and then in the summer months when it's
 
03:23:04.250 --> 03:23:04.260 align:start position:0%
warmer they can draw the lake lake water
 
03:23:07.250 --> 03:23:07.260 align:start position:0%
from a lower level where the water stays
 
03:23:09.889 --> 03:23:09.899 align:start position:0%
cool so it's an ideal spot to do what
 
03:23:11.929 --> 03:23:11.939 align:start position:0%
they've been doing obviously the Powder
 
03:23:14.210 --> 03:23:14.220 align:start position:0%
Mill Hatchery has been in the in Warwick
 
03:23:16.250 --> 03:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
since 46 I think
 
03:23:19.250 --> 03:23:19.260 align:start position:0%
and man I I just don't think that if
 
03:23:20.570 --> 03:23:20.580 align:start position:0%
they've got that much out of the money
 
03:23:23.809 --> 03:23:23.819 align:start position:0%
58 million in apple money I'd like to
 
03:23:25.570 --> 03:23:25.580 align:start position:0%
see this
 
03:23:28.370 --> 03:23:28.380 align:start position:0%
4.615 million be directed to where we
 
03:23:31.790 --> 03:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
directed it two years ago it doesn't
 
03:23:34.490 --> 03:23:34.500 align:start position:0%
seem to me like if they had 58 million
 
03:23:36.349 --> 03:23:36.359 align:start position:0%
and other changes to do they couldn't
 
03:23:38.450 --> 03:23:38.460 align:start position:0%
cover it with the other money without
 
03:23:41.929 --> 03:23:41.939 align:start position:0%
getting into this and I I really oppose
 
03:23:44.150 --> 03:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
this because the part of my Hatchery I
 
03:23:46.969 --> 03:23:46.979 align:start position:0%
took a long tour there and they have
 
03:23:49.849 --> 03:23:49.859 align:start position:0%
cement troughs that are crumbling and
 
03:23:51.229 --> 03:23:51.239 align:start position:0%
breaking apart
 
03:23:53.750 --> 03:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
and it's just not it's got to be fixed
 
03:23:55.809 --> 03:23:55.819 align:start position:0%
we need to keep this
 
03:23:59.030 --> 03:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
resource it's an ideal place
 
03:23:59.040 --> 03:24:00.729 align:start position:0%
resource it's an ideal place
and

03:24:00.729 --> 03:24:00.739 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:24:04.130 --> 03:24:04.140 align:start position:0%
the tourism that's generated tourism
 
03:24:08.090 --> 03:24:08.100 align:start position:0%
doll is from the Fisheries is tremendous
 
03:24:10.610 --> 03:24:10.620 align:start position:0%
and it's right in that area it's you got
 
03:24:13.849 --> 03:24:13.859 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee meeting again all the I
 
03:24:16.190 --> 03:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
think they go as far south as Hampton to
 
03:24:18.650 --> 03:24:18.660 align:start position:0%
the Seacoast to stock trout so they
 
03:24:21.830 --> 03:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
covered the Powder Mill Hatchery does a
 
03:24:23.809 --> 03:24:23.819 align:start position:0%
lot for the state and man I just would
 
03:24:25.910 --> 03:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
like to see them they came to also the
 
03:24:27.969 --> 03:24:27.979 align:start position:0%
plan they're going to put in all new
 
03:24:30.110 --> 03:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
instead of the symmetro office they were
 
03:24:32.210 --> 03:24:32.220 align:start position:0%
going to be fiberglass it was going to
 
03:24:34.550 --> 03:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
be updated and take care of the affluent
 
03:24:37.429 --> 03:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
that was going uh the fish waste and
 
03:24:39.229 --> 03:24:39.239 align:start position:0%
going down into the river and causing
 
03:24:42.650 --> 03:24:42.660 align:start position:0%
algae bloom so again man I would hate to
 
03:24:45.590 --> 03:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
see this if they've got 58 million
 
03:24:48.410 --> 03:24:48.420 align:start position:0%
and beside this 4 million I'd like to
 
03:24:49.490 --> 03:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
know what they're going to do with that
 
03:24:51.229 --> 03:24:51.239 align:start position:0%
money if the hatcheries need that much
 
03:24:53.570 --> 03:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
improvement thank you representative
 
03:24:55.610 --> 03:24:55.620 align:start position:0%
representative Mills
 
03:24:57.349 --> 03:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
um representative uh
 
03:24:59.150 --> 03:24:59.160 align:start position:0%
the new commissioner Scott Mason
 
03:25:01.610 --> 03:25:01.620 align:start position:0%
actually came to me about this and
 
03:25:04.130 --> 03:25:04.140 align:start position:0%
wanted to know how to go about it his
 
03:25:07.969 --> 03:25:07.979 align:start position:0%
his concern is to not not do the Powder
 
03:25:09.950 --> 03:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
Mill Hatchery it's the fact that this
 
03:25:12.650 --> 03:25:12.660 align:start position:0%
was a lapse extension and if he didn't
 
03:25:14.809 --> 03:25:14.819 align:start position:0%
you he thought if he didn't use this
 
03:25:17.929 --> 03:25:17.939 align:start position:0%
money he was going to lose it which he
 
03:25:19.969 --> 03:25:19.979 align:start position:0%
would have without getting a lap without
 
03:25:22.429 --> 03:25:22.439 align:start position:0%
getting the lapse extended and his
 
03:25:24.110 --> 03:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
intent was to make sure that if he
 
03:25:27.830 --> 03:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
didn't need all of the money for Powder
 
03:25:30.170 --> 03:25:30.180 align:start position:0%
Mill that it could he could still retain
 
03:25:33.769 --> 03:25:33.779 align:start position:0%
it and use it for the other hatcheries
 
03:25:36.290 --> 03:25:36.300 align:start position:0%
so this what the intent was simply to
 
03:25:39.349 --> 03:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
amend it mend the title of it so that he
 
03:25:41.150 --> 03:25:41.160 align:start position:0%
could use any money that he doesn't use
 
03:25:44.330 --> 03:25:44.340 align:start position:0%
on Powder Mill on the other hatcheries
 
03:25:46.790 --> 03:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
and I think if necessary we can get him
 
03:25:49.309 --> 03:25:49.319 align:start position:0%
back here to speak of it
 
03:25:53.929 --> 03:25:53.939 align:start position:0%
would um as as an interim motion or a an
 
03:25:56.809 --> 03:25:56.819 align:start position:0%
amendment here uh would the committee
 
03:25:59.570 --> 03:25:59.580 align:start position:0%
possibly consider adding to the note
 
03:26:02.870 --> 03:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
that starts on 10 uh something to the
 
03:26:05.269 --> 03:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
language that it's it's the hope that
 
03:26:08.630 --> 03:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
they would prioritize uh necessary
 
03:26:12.469 --> 03:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
improvements to the Powder Mill Fish
 
03:26:15.349 --> 03:26:15.359 align:start position:0%
Hatchery before expending other funds
 
03:26:17.210 --> 03:26:17.220 align:start position:0%
representative Newton was something to
 
03:26:20.870 --> 03:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
that effect uh meet your approval
 
03:26:20.880 --> 03:26:21.530 align:start position:0%
that effect uh meet your approval
um

03:26:21.530 --> 03:26:21.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:23.690 --> 03:26:23.700 align:start position:0%
it certainly would go a long ways to
 
03:26:26.570 --> 03:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
meeting it I'd like to see where exactly
 
03:26:29.690 --> 03:26:29.700 align:start position:0%
how these funds lapse and because we
 
03:26:31.429 --> 03:26:31.439 align:start position:0%
just basically gave the state treasure
 
03:26:32.929 --> 03:26:32.939 align:start position:0%
or authorized to borrow upon the credit
 
03:26:34.969 --> 03:26:34.979 align:start position:0%
of the state that amount of money if
 
03:26:37.490 --> 03:26:37.500 align:start position:0%
that hasn't been done yet does it lapse
 
03:26:39.229 --> 03:26:39.239 align:start position:0%
because they haven't done it isn't it on
 
03:26:41.590 --> 03:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan
 
03:26:43.550 --> 03:26:43.560 align:start position:0%
represent Jack do you want to answer
 
03:26:45.590 --> 03:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
that question it's it's the monies
 
03:26:47.990 --> 03:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
haven't been I'll I'll start and you can
 
03:26:50.210 --> 03:26:50.220 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong
 
03:26:53.210 --> 03:26:53.220 align:start position:0%
um so it was fun said hadn't been
 
03:26:56.269 --> 03:26:56.279 align:start position:0%
expended and if they didn't if they
 
03:26:58.250 --> 03:26:58.260 align:start position:0%
didn't come up with an immediate need or
 
03:26:59.929 --> 03:26:59.939 align:start position:0%
what that use was going to be it was
 
03:27:01.550 --> 03:27:01.560 align:start position:0%
going to go away
 
03:27:04.910 --> 03:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
so the the understanding I believe I
 
03:27:06.530 --> 03:27:06.540 align:start position:0%
came in at the end of this conversation
 
03:27:10.010 --> 03:27:10.020 align:start position:0%
was that they did not want that money to
 
03:27:12.950 --> 03:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
lapse and and
 
03:27:15.229 --> 03:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
that's where we are
 
03:27:17.090 --> 03:27:17.100 align:start position:0%
representative Jack am I interested in
 
03:27:19.309 --> 03:27:19.319 align:start position:0%
that the status of
 
03:27:22.130 --> 03:27:22.140 align:start position:0%
whatever we appropriate is considered to
 
03:27:25.550 --> 03:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
be authorized but unissued bonding and
 
03:27:27.050 --> 03:27:27.060 align:start position:0%
what the state treasurer does is
 
03:27:29.510 --> 03:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
depending on the cash flow position of
 
03:27:33.469 --> 03:27:33.479 align:start position:0%
the state will once a year will issue
 
03:27:36.610 --> 03:27:36.620 align:start position:0%
General obligation bonds
 
03:27:38.870 --> 03:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
where the debt service is from the
 
03:27:40.429 --> 03:27:40.439 align:start position:0%
general fund in this case it would be
 
03:27:41.630 --> 03:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
Fish and Game
 
03:27:44.090 --> 03:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
funds but um
 
03:27:46.429 --> 03:27:46.439 align:start position:0%
we don't issue the debt unless it's
 
03:27:49.190 --> 03:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
actually needed to cover cash flow
 
03:27:51.469 --> 03:27:51.479 align:start position:0%
so it's authorized but unissued up until
 
03:27:53.750 --> 03:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
that point
 
03:27:57.050 --> 03:27:57.060 align:start position:0%
is that does that answer your question
 
03:28:00.469 --> 03:28:00.479 align:start position:0%
well yes it does to a degree again you
 
03:28:01.790 --> 03:28:01.800 align:start position:0%
know if they knew this money was going
 
03:28:04.849 --> 03:28:04.859 align:start position:0%
to disappear in two years why wasn't I'd
 
03:28:06.530 --> 03:28:06.540 align:start position:0%
like a good explanation as to why they
 
03:28:08.510 --> 03:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
didn't do something
 
03:28:10.490 --> 03:28:10.500 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if anybody here can
 
03:28:12.769 --> 03:28:12.779 align:start position:0%
answer that well we have we have
 
03:28:15.530 --> 03:28:15.540 align:start position:0%
projects that for whatever reason don't
 
03:28:17.389 --> 03:28:17.399 align:start position:0%
get off the ground for a couple years
 
03:28:21.170 --> 03:28:21.180 align:start position:0%
it's normal procedure to extend an
 
03:28:23.269 --> 03:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
appropriation until the project that it
 
03:28:25.550 --> 03:28:25.560 align:start position:0%
was appropriated for is done and then
 
03:28:28.190 --> 03:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
whatever funds remaining would lapse and
 
03:28:30.469 --> 03:28:30.479 align:start position:0%
the appropriation would disappear so
 
03:28:32.210 --> 03:28:32.220 align:start position:0%
this happens you know if you look at
 
03:28:33.710 --> 03:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
administrative Services you have the
 
03:28:35.389 --> 03:28:35.399 align:start position:0%
same situation with a lot of the 21
 
03:28:37.729 --> 03:28:37.739 align:start position:0%
Appropriations where they haven't
 
03:28:40.130 --> 03:28:40.140 align:start position:0%
started the project because of it takes
 
03:28:43.490 --> 03:28:43.500 align:start position:0%
a while to to get the RFP out and for a
 
03:28:46.490 --> 03:28:46.500 align:start position:0%
contractor to for the contract to be
 
03:28:50.090 --> 03:28:50.100 align:start position:0%
awarded so it's normal practice that the
 
03:28:52.790 --> 03:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
projects that are bonded that are that
 
03:28:56.330 --> 03:28:56.340 align:start position:0%
are authorized in hospital 25 may take
 
03:28:58.610 --> 03:28:58.620 align:start position:0%
you know in some cases eight or ten
 
03:29:01.010 --> 03:29:01.020 align:start position:0%
years to run all the way to completion
 
03:29:02.510 --> 03:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
and there's just simply it's normal
 
03:29:04.510 --> 03:29:04.520 align:start position:0%
practice to extend the appropriation
 
03:29:07.670 --> 03:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
that's why the section 12 of this year's
 
03:29:12.769 --> 03:29:12.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:15.410 --> 03:29:15.420 align:start position:0%
represent Newton are you satisfied at
 
03:29:17.450 --> 03:29:17.460 align:start position:0%
this point in time um at this time yep
 
03:29:20.030 --> 03:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
would you be in favor of asking to add
 
03:29:23.330 --> 03:29:23.340 align:start position:0%
an additional note on here absolutely
 
03:29:27.070 --> 03:29:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:29.870 --> 03:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
just after hearing the amount of Arbor
 
03:29:31.790 --> 03:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
funds they're going to get I just wonder
 
03:29:34.550 --> 03:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
why this is needed to build up such a
 
03:29:36.670 --> 03:29:36.680 align:start position:0%
pot of money
 
03:29:39.290 --> 03:29:39.300 align:start position:0%
what are the plans to use that massive
 
03:29:41.030 --> 03:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
amount of money I mean they actually
 
03:29:42.769 --> 03:29:42.779 align:start position:0%
need this
 
03:29:45.429 --> 03:29:45.439 align:start position:0%
they my
 
03:29:47.330 --> 03:29:47.340 align:start position:0%
understanding is that our fish
 
03:29:50.469 --> 03:29:50.479 align:start position:0%
hatcheries are in such a disrepair
 
03:29:53.710 --> 03:29:53.720 align:start position:0%
number one some of them are
 
03:29:57.469 --> 03:29:57.479 align:start position:0%
they're looking at whether the practices
 
03:30:00.050 --> 03:30:00.060 align:start position:0%
at each Hatchery should remain the same
 
03:30:02.809 --> 03:30:02.819 align:start position:0%
or if the state would be better served
 
03:30:05.750 --> 03:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
by switching some of those items to
 
03:30:08.710 --> 03:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
different uh hatcheries
 
03:30:11.690 --> 03:30:11.700 align:start position:0%
it's a and it's an economic engine
 
03:30:13.490 --> 03:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
someone's already mentioned for our
 
03:30:17.210 --> 03:30:17.220 align:start position:0%
state to have these facilities
 
03:30:17.220 --> 03:30:17.809 align:start position:0%
state to have these facilities
um

03:30:17.809 --> 03:30:17.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:22.309 --> 03:30:22.319 align:start position:0%
it was deemed to be necessary when the
 
03:30:24.469 --> 03:30:24.479 align:start position:0%
arpa funds were asked for and approved
 
03:30:27.290 --> 03:30:27.300 align:start position:0%
so I I'm of the opinion that it is
 
03:30:27.300 --> 03:30:29.349 align:start position:0%
so I I'm of the opinion that it is
necessary

03:30:29.349 --> 03:30:29.359 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
03:30:38.389 --> 03:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:41.330 --> 03:30:41.340 align:start position:0%
Chris is there some sort of language
 
03:30:43.429 --> 03:30:43.439 align:start position:0%
that we might be able to suggest there I
 
03:30:45.290 --> 03:30:45.300 align:start position:0%
can do a straw poll and see if the
 
03:30:46.849 --> 03:30:46.859 align:start position:0%
committee's in favor let's start with
 
03:30:50.269 --> 03:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
that is the committee in favor of adding
 
03:30:54.349 --> 03:30:54.359 align:start position:0%
adding a note on here if you do signify
 
03:30:59.809 --> 03:30:59.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:03.110 --> 03:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
it looks it looks unanimous so so what I
 
03:31:04.790 --> 03:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
can do is work something out and bring
 
03:31:06.469 --> 03:31:06.479 align:start position:0%
it back on Friday for the committee to
 
03:31:09.290 --> 03:31:09.300 align:start position:0%
look at okay and um and if it's
 
03:31:11.450 --> 03:31:11.460 align:start position:0%
something that's uh meets your approval
 
03:31:14.389 --> 03:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
then we'd have it added to an amendment
 
03:31:15.830 --> 03:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:31:19.969 --> 03:31:19.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:22.690 --> 03:31:22.700 align:start position:0%
so the next page is amendment
 
03:31:25.910 --> 03:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
1005h it was a request from the
 
03:31:27.410 --> 03:31:27.420 align:start position:0%
Department of military Affairs and
 
03:31:30.650 --> 03:31:30.660 align:start position:0%
Veterans Services to expand the project
 
03:31:32.929 --> 03:31:32.939 align:start position:0%
scope from Manchester Readiness Center
 
03:31:35.210 --> 03:31:35.220 align:start position:0%
any terrorism Force to the Manchester
 
03:31:36.830 --> 03:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
Readiness Center and conquered
 
03:31:36.840 --> 03:31:38.570 align:start position:0%
Readiness Center and conquered
anti-terrorism

03:31:38.570 --> 03:31:38.580 align:start position:0%
anti-terrorism
 
03:31:41.389 --> 03:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
no again no change in the value
 
03:31:43.130 --> 03:31:43.140 align:start position:0%
associated with this
 
03:31:45.410 --> 03:31:45.420 align:start position:0%
it's just a broadened the scope of the
 
03:31:45.420 --> 03:31:48.650 align:start position:0%
it's just a broadened the scope of the
project

03:31:48.650 --> 03:31:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:51.530 --> 03:31:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:53.389 --> 03:31:53.399 align:start position:0%
the next one is
 
03:31:53.399 --> 03:31:53.990 align:start position:0%
the next one is
um

03:31:53.990 --> 03:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:55.910 --> 03:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
amendment 10
 
03:31:58.670 --> 03:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
20 H this is a request from the
 
03:32:00.590 --> 03:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety
 
03:32:01.849 --> 03:32:01.859 align:start position:0%
so the department of safety had
 
03:32:04.370 --> 03:32:04.380 align:start position:0%
requested to expand their Aviation
 
03:32:06.889 --> 03:32:06.899 align:start position:0%
Hangar project to include construction
 
03:32:10.490 --> 03:32:10.500 align:start position:0%
and renovation so they had anticipated
 
03:32:12.290 --> 03:32:12.300 align:start position:0%
they were going to be doing
 
03:32:14.389 --> 03:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
some construction and then they found
 
03:32:15.349 --> 03:32:15.359 align:start position:0%
that they're going to be renovating
 
03:32:17.269 --> 03:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
other parts so they just wanted to
 
03:32:18.950 --> 03:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
change the again the scope of the
 
03:32:22.550 --> 03:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
project it is two different projects so
 
03:32:24.050 --> 03:32:24.060 align:start position:0%
they're both included here that's why
 
03:32:25.190 --> 03:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
this amendment page is a little bit
 
03:32:26.929 --> 03:32:26.939 align:start position:0%
longer than the previous
 
03:32:28.550 --> 03:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
but again I think the department
 
03:32:29.929 --> 03:32:29.939 align:start position:0%
explained it pretty well to the
 
03:32:29.939 --> 03:32:35.389 align:start position:0%
explained it pretty well to the
committee

03:32:35.389 --> 03:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:37.550 --> 03:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
no questions
 
03:32:39.889 --> 03:32:39.899 align:start position:0%
the last amendment in your packet is
 
03:32:43.370 --> 03:32:43.380 align:start position:0%
zero nine eight zero h
 
03:32:45.469 --> 03:32:45.479 align:start position:0%
this was a request during the lapse
 
03:32:47.210 --> 03:32:47.220 align:start position:0%
extension meeting with the Department of
 
03:32:47.220 --> 03:32:49.729 align:start position:0%
extension meeting with the Department of
Transportation

03:32:49.729 --> 03:32:49.739 align:start position:0%
Transportation
 
03:32:52.250 --> 03:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
so if you see on line 13 The Market
 
03:32:54.830 --> 03:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
Street Marine Terminal project State
 
03:32:54.840 --> 03:32:56.150 align:start position:0%
Street Marine Terminal project State
match

03:32:56.150 --> 03:32:56.160 align:start position:0%
match
 
03:32:58.790 --> 03:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
so there was a a thought that they the
 
03:33:01.070 --> 03:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
department would be able to get a grant
 
03:33:04.429 --> 03:33:04.439 align:start position:0%
a discretionary Grant last biennium
 
03:33:06.290 --> 03:33:06.300 align:start position:0%
um that specific one didn't happen but
 
03:33:09.950 --> 03:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
there was a footnote to this um
 
03:33:12.110 --> 03:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
to this appropriation that would have
 
03:33:13.250 --> 03:33:13.260 align:start position:0%
allowed them to look for other
 
03:33:15.590 --> 03:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
discretionary grants when they came
 
03:33:17.510 --> 03:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
before the lapse extension
 
03:33:19.309 --> 03:33:19.319 align:start position:0%
um meeting on Monday
 
03:33:21.530 --> 03:33:21.540 align:start position:0%
they thought they could continue to do
 
03:33:24.530 --> 03:33:24.540 align:start position:0%
that with this lapse extension it was
 
03:33:26.630 --> 03:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
pointed out that the note was restricted
 
03:33:30.250 --> 03:33:30.260 align:start position:0%
to 22 23 so the note online
 
03:33:35.469 --> 03:33:35.479 align:start position:0%
22 23 convenient just expands it to be
 
03:33:41.389 --> 03:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
fiscal years biennium 22 23 and 24 25.
 
03:33:43.670 --> 03:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
the department testified that they think
 
03:33:45.830 --> 03:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
there will be some discretionary grants
 
03:33:48.469 --> 03:33:48.479 align:start position:0%
that they could try to access much of
 
03:33:51.229 --> 03:33:51.239 align:start position:0%
that has to do with the iija
 
03:33:54.170 --> 03:33:54.180 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure Act
 
03:33:56.570 --> 03:33:56.580 align:start position:0%
so those are the friendly amendments
 
03:33:56.580 --> 03:33:57.469 align:start position:0%
so those are the friendly amendments
that

03:33:57.469 --> 03:33:57.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:34:00.370 --> 03:34:00.380 align:start position:0%
we've just brought forward to today
 
03:34:03.710 --> 03:34:03.720 align:start position:0%
so with with the exception of the one we
 
03:34:07.370 --> 03:34:07.380 align:start position:0%
we spoke of which is 104 H which was the
 
03:34:09.469 --> 03:34:09.479 align:start position:0%
fish hatchery
 
03:34:09.479 --> 03:34:10.130 align:start position:0%
fish hatchery
um

03:34:10.130 --> 03:34:10.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:13.490 --> 03:34:13.500 align:start position:0%
it doesn't seem that we have any much
 
03:34:16.670 --> 03:34:16.680 align:start position:0%
discussion on the balance of those
 
03:34:19.750 --> 03:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
so in this packet that's presented here
 
03:34:23.229 --> 03:34:23.239 align:start position:0%
if you're in favor of the uh the the
 
03:34:26.330 --> 03:34:26.340 align:start position:0%
Amendments is shown
 
03:34:28.969 --> 03:34:28.979 align:start position:0%
um is there any further discussion on
 
03:34:30.590 --> 03:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
those before I call yes please
 
03:34:37.910 --> 03:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:40.309 --> 03:34:40.319 align:start position:0%
it's we're not to that point
 
03:34:42.530 --> 03:34:42.540 align:start position:0%
so the amendment you're looking at the
 
03:34:44.630 --> 03:34:44.640 align:start position:0%
amendment right
 
03:34:47.870 --> 03:34:47.880 align:start position:0%
so that's from the last capital budget
 
03:34:50.150 --> 03:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
so that was the language it was in the
 
03:34:52.370 --> 03:34:52.380 align:start position:0%
2021 capital budget so it has nothing to
 
03:34:53.750 --> 03:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
do with what you're going to decide for
 
03:34:57.650 --> 03:34:57.660 align:start position:0%
the capital budget for 24.25
 
03:35:00.229 --> 03:35:00.239 align:start position:0%
the entire section was put in there
 
03:35:01.790 --> 03:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
because of the note that was the only
 
03:35:03.710 --> 03:35:03.720 align:start position:0%
thing that was being amended and so it
 
03:35:07.010 --> 03:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
could easily be seen where the note went
 
03:35:09.290 --> 03:35:09.300 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:35:13.550 --> 03:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:16.250 --> 03:35:16.260 align:start position:0%
um if you're in and this is a straw poll
 
03:35:18.349 --> 03:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
only if you're in favor the Amendments
 
03:35:24.769 --> 03:35:24.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:27.590 --> 03:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh we seem to be in full agreement thank
 
03:35:27.600 --> 03:35:38.630 align:start position:0%
uh we seem to be in full agreement thank
you

03:35:38.630 --> 03:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:41.929 --> 03:35:41.939 align:start position:0%
Chris at this time should we uh take up
 
03:35:44.570 --> 03:35:44.580 align:start position:0%
changes to the project amounts contain
 
03:35:50.570 --> 03:35:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:53.750 --> 03:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
you can do that if you'd like yep all
 
03:35:53.760 --> 03:35:57.950 align:start position:0%
you can do that if you'd like yep all
right

03:35:57.950 --> 03:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:00.710 --> 03:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
if it would be easier I can point to
 
03:36:07.190 --> 03:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:10.490 --> 03:36:10.500 align:start position:0%
so on on the compare document so the
 
03:36:18.070 --> 03:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:20.990 --> 03:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
invite go to Environmental Services row
 
03:36:21.000 --> 03:36:22.250 align:start position:0%
invite go to Environmental Services row
28

03:36:22.250 --> 03:36:22.260 align:start position:0%
28
 
03:36:24.769 --> 03:36:24.779 align:start position:0%
it's the drinking water State revolving
 
03:36:27.110 --> 03:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
fund State match
 
03:36:28.610 --> 03:36:28.620 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
03:36:30.290 --> 03:36:30.300 align:start position:0%
came in and said that amount is
 
03:36:33.590 --> 03:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
incorrect under column C it says ten
 
03:36:37.010 --> 03:36:37.020 align:start position:0%
four eight eight two eight three it's
 
03:36:38.990 --> 03:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
actually 10
 
03:36:41.389 --> 03:36:41.399 align:start position:0%
four four eight so there's a forty
 
03:36:43.790 --> 03:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar pickup for the if you
 
03:36:52.610 --> 03:36:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:54.710 --> 03:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
so I can I can go through all of them
 
03:36:57.710 --> 03:36:57.720 align:start position:0%
and then you can do a a straw poll or
 
03:36:58.910 --> 03:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
you can do it each one I don't know how
 
03:37:01.309 --> 03:37:01.319 align:start position:0%
you want to handle that yeah I'll show
 
03:37:05.269 --> 03:37:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:07.570 --> 03:37:07.580 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah yeah
 
03:37:09.650 --> 03:37:09.660 align:start position:0%
somewhere along in the process I got
 
03:37:11.450 --> 03:37:11.460 align:start position:0%
transposed to be an eight instead of a
 
03:37:11.460 --> 03:37:13.190 align:start position:0%
transposed to be an eight instead of a
four

03:37:13.190 --> 03:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
four
 
03:37:14.630 --> 03:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
um I don't think there was any specific
 
03:37:18.349 --> 03:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
blame provided to anybody but it's uh
 
03:37:21.710 --> 03:37:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:33.969 --> 03:37:33.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:36.650 --> 03:37:36.660 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry I can go back to page one
 
03:37:39.130 --> 03:37:39.140 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
03:37:43.429 --> 03:37:43.439 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm running ahead Department of
 
03:37:43.439 --> 03:37:44.510 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm running ahead Department of
Education

03:37:44.510 --> 03:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
Education
 
03:37:49.910 --> 03:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
on um line 18 is the project to acquire
 
03:37:53.030 --> 03:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
the 25 Hall Street project you heard
 
03:37:55.490 --> 03:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
from the governor's budget director
 
03:37:57.650 --> 03:37:57.660 align:start position:0%
as well in some of the conversation when
 
03:37:59.630 --> 03:37:59.640 align:start position:0%
the um
 
03:38:01.910 --> 03:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner was here that the amount
 
03:38:03.290 --> 03:38:03.300 align:start position:0%
that was originally proposed for the
 
03:38:07.610 --> 03:38:07.620 align:start position:0%
project was 7 million not 10.5 million
 
03:38:09.530 --> 03:38:09.540 align:start position:0%
um so the committee may want to consider
 
03:38:16.309 --> 03:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:30.110 --> 03:38:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:31.729 --> 03:38:31.739 align:start position:0%
Kathy provincial is the one that came up
 
03:38:34.610 --> 03:38:34.620 align:start position:0%
with 7 million I've got pretty good
 
03:38:36.710 --> 03:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
faith in Kathy more than the average
 
03:38:39.410 --> 03:38:39.420 align:start position:0%
bear and how admin Services just pop
 
03:38:42.170 --> 03:38:42.180 align:start position:0%
this up 50 percent I don't understand
 
03:38:44.950 --> 03:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
but I think Kathy would be able to
 
03:38:47.510 --> 03:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
suggest to the system regardless of what
 
03:38:49.670 --> 03:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
the appraisal shows that if we approve
 
03:38:52.870 --> 03:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:55.670 --> 03:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
I'd give them 7.5 just for the flux in
 
03:38:55.680 --> 03:39:00.110 align:start position:0%
I'd give them 7.5 just for the flux in
time

03:39:00.110 --> 03:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:03.050 --> 03:39:03.060 align:start position:0%
Let's uh let's let's run through and
 
03:39:05.750 --> 03:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
look at it I'm only four yeah there's
 
03:39:07.429 --> 03:39:07.439 align:start position:0%
there's just four of these and then
 
03:39:11.929 --> 03:39:11.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:16.250 --> 03:39:16.260 align:start position:0%
please continue going to page two
 
03:39:19.790 --> 03:39:19.800 align:start position:0%

project in the capital budget so the 875
 
03:39:37.190 --> 03:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:40.550 --> 03:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
and then the last one

03:39:48.370 --> 03:39:48.380 align:start position:0%
it's the Department of Transportation

overstated by 5.893 million
 
03:40:11.090 --> 03:40:11.100 align:start position:0%

from seven million eighty five
 
03:41:30.950 --> 03:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
thousand seven hundred and eight dollars
 
03:41:33.349 --> 03:41:33.359 align:start position:0%

by
 
03:41:42.229 --> 03:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
by eating thank you
 
03:41:43.190 --> 03:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
um now
 
03:41:46.370 --> 03:41:46.380 align:start position:0%
um any further discussion on on the item
 
03:41:48.950 --> 03:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
yes represent Faulkner we want to
 
03:41:51.170 --> 03:41:51.180 align:start position:0%
discuss adding the 500 000 that
 
03:41:53.750 --> 03:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
representative Eaton suggested as a way
 
03:41:53.760 --> 03:41:55.250 align:start position:0%
representative Eaton suggested as a way
to

03:41:55.250 --> 03:41:55.260 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:41:57.790 --> 03:41:57.800 align:start position:0%
you know recognize the
 
03:42:00.050 --> 03:42:00.060 align:start position:0%
forthcoming nature of the administration
 
03:42:02.809 --> 03:42:02.819 align:start position:0%
I mean the requests collapse advancement
 
03:42:05.990 --> 03:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
okay let's uh let's be willing to add
 
03:42:09.469 --> 03:42:09.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:12.889 --> 03:42:12.899 align:start position:0%
we don't want to be punitive here
 
03:42:16.729 --> 03:42:16.739 align:start position:0%
I'm for representative Eaton I'm just
 
03:42:16.739 --> 03:42:17.510 align:start position:0%
I'm for representative Eaton I'm just
um

03:42:17.510 --> 03:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:19.910 --> 03:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
there were several sidebar conversations
 
03:42:23.690 --> 03:42:23.700 align:start position:0%
out here uh with with public works and
 
03:42:27.469 --> 03:42:27.479 align:start position:0%
and others and everyone felt comfortable
 
03:42:29.809 --> 03:42:29.819 align:start position:0%
at the seven million dollar which she
 
03:42:33.550 --> 03:42:33.560 align:start position:0%
did okay all right
 
03:42:37.130 --> 03:42:37.140 align:start position:0%
yeah we I'm sorry so
 
03:42:37.140 --> 03:42:38.090 align:start position:0%
yeah we I'm sorry so
um

03:42:38.090 --> 03:42:38.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:41.090 --> 03:42:41.100 align:start position:0%
there was a discussion with uh Public
 
03:42:44.150 --> 03:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
Works on whether what the number correct
 
03:42:46.849 --> 03:42:46.859 align:start position:0%
number was because they started at seven
 
03:42:49.370 --> 03:42:49.380 align:start position:0%
million dollars and they had done some
 
03:42:52.070 --> 03:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
calculations on square footage and so
 
03:42:55.190 --> 03:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
forth in the building and
 
03:42:59.690 --> 03:42:59.700 align:start position:0%
um but what they neglected to to figure
 
03:43:02.690 --> 03:43:02.700 align:start position:0%
at the time was if you've been in that
 
03:43:04.429 --> 03:43:04.439 align:start position:0%
building and we'll go to that building
 
03:43:07.010 --> 03:43:07.020 align:start position:0%
there's a great big Atrium that rises up
 
03:43:09.650 --> 03:43:09.660 align:start position:0%
through the center of that building
 
03:43:12.769 --> 03:43:12.779 align:start position:0%
um which was when when Public Works was
 
03:43:15.469 --> 03:43:15.479 align:start position:0%
looking at it they were figuring that
 
03:43:18.490 --> 03:43:18.500 align:start position:0%
square footage into their cost figure
 
03:43:21.229 --> 03:43:21.239 align:start position:0%
and when it was realized that that
 
03:43:23.030 --> 03:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
square footage really isn't usable
 
03:43:25.250 --> 03:43:25.260 align:start position:0%
square footage it brought their number
 
03:43:27.830 --> 03:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
back in line and they all seemed to
 
03:43:30.710 --> 03:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
think that seven million would be the
 
03:43:30.720 --> 03:43:31.969 align:start position:0%
think that seven million would be the
number

03:43:31.969 --> 03:43:31.979 align:start position:0%
number
 
03:43:35.510 --> 03:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
I should have shared that with you so
 
03:43:38.630 --> 03:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
so I unless unless there's further
 
03:43:41.030 --> 03:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
discussion I think I think we're fine at
 
03:43:42.349 --> 03:43:42.359 align:start position:0%
the seven minute rep temperatures
 
03:43:45.710 --> 03:43:45.720 align:start position:0%
briefly Mr chair the um the 7 million
 
03:43:48.469 --> 03:43:48.479 align:start position:0%
and that estimate was made
 
03:43:48.479 --> 03:43:49.790 align:start position:0%
and that estimate was made
they

03:43:49.790 --> 03:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:43:51.590 --> 03:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
they got a proposal that estimate was
 
03:43:55.550 --> 03:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
made uh several months ago or taken into
 
03:43:57.170 --> 03:43:57.180 align:start position:0%
account any acceleration or any
 
03:43:59.750 --> 03:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
appreciation of property values
 
03:44:05.050 --> 03:44:05.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:08.870 --> 03:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
yeah but it's from UNH on on their price
 
03:44:11.389 --> 03:44:11.399 align:start position:0%
to sell the property they had acquired
 
03:44:14.090 --> 03:44:14.100 align:start position:0%
the property and found that it wasn't of
 
03:44:17.030 --> 03:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
continued use for them and then um the
 
03:44:18.830 --> 03:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Education then figured
 
03:44:21.590 --> 03:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
that that was a great space I think they
 
03:44:23.030 --> 03:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
started out buying that building before
 
03:44:24.950 --> 03:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
Renovations at somewhere around four
 
03:44:26.750 --> 03:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
03:44:29.269 --> 03:44:29.279 align:start position:0%
so there was work done to the building
 
03:44:32.990 --> 03:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
and so then it was uh everyone seems to
 
03:44:34.610 --> 03:44:34.620 align:start position:0%
be in agreement that seven million is
 
03:44:38.330 --> 03:44:38.340 align:start position:0%
our number which adds uh money back into
 
03:44:39.950 --> 03:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
our budget
 
03:44:43.429 --> 03:44:43.439 align:start position:0%
um representative Newman did you have a
 
03:44:43.439 --> 03:44:45.410 align:start position:0%
um representative Newman did you have a
question

03:44:45.410 --> 03:44:45.420 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:44:47.690 --> 03:44:47.700 align:start position:0%
a comment if that'd be all right sure
 
03:44:47.700 --> 03:44:50.870 align:start position:0%
a comment if that'd be all right sure
yeah

03:44:50.870 --> 03:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:55.910 --> 03:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:58.849 --> 03:44:58.859 align:start position:0%
but my understanding also from uh
 
03:45:01.849 --> 03:45:01.859 align:start position:0%
following up with Mr Shea
 
03:45:05.210 --> 03:45:05.220 align:start position:0%
there hasn't been a an appraisal done on
 
03:45:06.950 --> 03:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
that building so I don't know what it
 
03:45:09.590 --> 03:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding from your
 
03:45:12.229 --> 03:45:12.239 align:start position:0%
information so I don't know I really
 
03:45:14.090 --> 03:45:14.100 align:start position:0%
don't know how they could somebody can
 
03:45:16.670 --> 03:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
come up with an estimate as apparently
 
03:45:19.429 --> 03:45:19.439 align:start position:0%
they did you know that's fine
 
03:45:22.250 --> 03:45:22.260 align:start position:0%
um maybe an official appraisal isn't
 
03:45:24.590 --> 03:45:24.600 align:start position:0%
necessary if everybody's in agreement
 
03:45:27.849 --> 03:45:27.859 align:start position:0%
with the parties involved
 
03:45:30.110 --> 03:45:30.120 align:start position:0%
my understanding is the official
 
03:45:33.110 --> 03:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
appraisal is in the process of happening
 
03:45:35.090 --> 03:45:35.100 align:start position:0%
they've done an initial assessment of
 
03:45:36.229 --> 03:45:36.239 align:start position:0%
the building
 
03:45:38.330 --> 03:45:38.340 align:start position:0%
and that that will follow through but
 
03:45:41.450 --> 03:45:41.460 align:start position:0%
they were needing some direction uh from
 
03:45:44.150 --> 03:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
us as to how they were going to move and
 
03:45:47.330 --> 03:45:47.340 align:start position:0%
if we were to say uh 7 million was our
 
03:45:48.950 --> 03:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
number they were all moving in that
 
03:45:50.570 --> 03:45:50.580 align:start position:0%
direction and I'm sure they're going to
 
03:45:52.429 --> 03:45:52.439 align:start position:0%
have to have appraisals and I I pass
 
03:45:54.590 --> 03:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
back to you Chris on that
 
03:45:57.229 --> 03:45:57.239 align:start position:0%
So based on the information I obtained
 
03:46:00.349 --> 03:46:00.359 align:start position:0%
from both doe and Das Public Works is
 
03:46:02.389 --> 03:46:02.399 align:start position:0%
there's continuing to be some work work
 
03:46:04.910 --> 03:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
to look at the value of the building but
 
03:46:08.090 --> 03:46:08.100 align:start position:0%
the agreement is is a a I think a verbal
 
03:46:11.870 --> 03:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
agreement between the um usnh
 
03:46:14.690 --> 03:46:14.700 align:start position:0%
um Kathy prevention and and um
 
03:46:18.650 --> 03:46:18.660 align:start position:0%
commissioner edelblue to to the usnh is
 
03:46:20.330 --> 03:46:20.340 align:start position:0%
going to get rid of that building no
 
03:46:21.710 --> 03:46:21.720 align:start position:0%
matter what they don't need it they
 
03:46:23.090 --> 03:46:23.100 align:start position:0%
don't want it they don't want to keep
 
03:46:24.710 --> 03:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
maintaining it
 
03:46:26.510 --> 03:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
um so they're going to dispose of it so
 
03:46:28.849 --> 03:46:28.859 align:start position:0%
if doe doesn't take it it will be
 
03:46:31.370 --> 03:46:31.380 align:start position:0%
disposed of
 
03:46:34.550 --> 03:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
03:46:38.690 --> 03:46:38.700 align:start position:0%
all right so if you're in favor of these
 
03:46:42.590 --> 03:46:42.600 align:start position:0%
four items as listed and spoke of and
 
03:46:44.630 --> 03:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
this is straw poll so that we can then
 
03:46:46.910 --> 03:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
move forward with the bigger discussion
 
03:46:52.610 --> 03:46:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:55.550 --> 03:46:55.560 align:start position:0%
straw poll shows that were unanimous in
 
03:46:57.710 --> 03:46:57.720 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
03:47:01.309 --> 03:47:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:03.410 --> 03:47:03.420 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh there seems to be a
 
03:47:05.150 --> 03:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
little on their repurpose amendments
 
03:47:08.030 --> 03:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
that we did on on the agency request
 
03:47:10.729 --> 03:47:10.739 align:start position:0%
sign 27 there's one for liquor that we
 
03:47:13.010 --> 03:47:13.020 align:start position:0%
don't have an amendment for yet is there
 
03:47:14.929 --> 03:47:14.939 align:start position:0%
a status on that
 
03:47:16.969 --> 03:47:16.979 align:start position:0%
uh you know you won't need a um an
 
03:47:18.050 --> 03:47:18.060 align:start position:0%
amendment for that that's a current
 
03:47:19.790 --> 03:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
project there it's in this capital
 
03:47:22.550 --> 03:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
budget so when you get to liquor
 
03:47:24.590 --> 03:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
you would need to change that title then
 
03:47:25.910 --> 03:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
I would just have it changed I don't
 
03:47:30.830 --> 03:47:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:30.840 --> 03:47:33.349 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:47:33.349 --> 03:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:47:38.210 --> 03:47:38.220 align:start position:0%
so let's um let's go turn now to
 
03:47:38.220 --> 03:47:39.170 align:start position:0%
so let's um let's go turn now to
um

03:47:39.170 --> 03:47:39.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:41.750 --> 03:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
our spreadsheet that we have on the
 
03:47:43.330 --> 03:47:43.340 align:start position:0%
capital budget
 
03:47:47.450 --> 03:47:47.460 align:start position:0%
which has the governor's proposal what
 
03:47:50.030 --> 03:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to approve by the house and
 
03:47:54.170 --> 03:47:54.180 align:start position:0%
differences listed and I think our what
 
03:47:55.670 --> 03:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
we're going to do is just start at the
 
03:47:59.570 --> 03:47:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:02.450 --> 03:48:02.460 align:start position:0%
if you have uh questions on each item as
 
03:48:04.309 --> 03:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
we get there let's have that discussion
 
03:48:08.030 --> 03:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
as we go and if there's uh if there's
 
03:48:10.250 --> 03:48:10.260 align:start position:0%
much disagreement then we may pass and
 
03:48:12.050 --> 03:48:12.060 align:start position:0%
move on to the next one
 
03:48:12.060 --> 03:48:13.370 align:start position:0%
move on to the next one
so

03:48:13.370 --> 03:48:13.380 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:48:15.670 --> 03:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
we can start right up on the top
 
03:48:19.269 --> 03:48:19.279 align:start position:0%
administrative Services Court facilities
 
03:48:21.950 --> 03:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
Courthouse generators
 
03:48:26.269 --> 03:48:26.279 align:start position:0%
uh Governor's proposal is one million
 
03:48:31.429 --> 03:48:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:34.370 --> 03:48:34.380 align:start position:0%
and these were listed as priorities is
 
03:48:41.269 --> 03:48:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:45.469 --> 03:48:45.479 align:start position:0%
the Rochester Courthouse it's 17 million
 
03:48:47.590 --> 03:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
five hundred thousand
 
03:48:52.790 --> 03:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:54.650 --> 03:48:54.660 align:start position:0%
I believe there is to be discussion on
 
03:48:56.389 --> 03:48:56.399 align:start position:0%
that do you want discussion on that or
 
03:49:00.070 --> 03:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:02.510 --> 03:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
represent Kaczynski
 
03:49:05.150 --> 03:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
yeah well our biggest we had some
 
03:49:06.650 --> 03:49:06.660 align:start position:0%
question on
 
03:49:10.429 --> 03:49:10.439 align:start position:0%
the dispersal of the Old Courthouse
 
03:49:10.439 --> 03:49:12.530 align:start position:0%
the dispersal of the Old Courthouse
okay

03:49:12.530 --> 03:49:12.540 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:49:15.170 --> 03:49:15.180 align:start position:0%
supposedly there's a process for doing
 
03:49:18.710 --> 03:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
that to well you get the maximum for
 
03:49:21.830 --> 03:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizens
 
03:49:25.250 --> 03:49:25.260 align:start position:0%
and we were told we have a deal made on
 
03:49:27.650 --> 03:49:27.660 align:start position:0%
that for a trade at substantially lower
 
03:49:27.660 --> 03:49:31.429 align:start position:0%
that for a trade at substantially lower
value

03:49:31.429 --> 03:49:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:35.030 --> 03:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
so uh through through the other
 
03:49:36.950 --> 03:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
committees that I've had the privilege
 
03:49:40.190 --> 03:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
of serving uh capital budget and long
 
03:49:40.200 --> 03:49:41.830 align:start position:0%
of serving uh capital budget and long
range

03:49:41.830 --> 03:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
range
 
03:49:44.510 --> 03:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
and in this committee and correct me if
 
03:49:47.090 --> 03:49:47.100 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong John in this committee we've
 
03:49:49.010 --> 03:49:49.020 align:start position:0%
been talking about or represent Mills
 
03:49:51.349 --> 03:49:51.359 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about this Courthouse
 
03:49:55.750 --> 03:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
first of all the need for it and
 
03:49:58.450 --> 03:49:58.460 align:start position:0%
the problem
 
03:50:01.070 --> 03:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
Public Works was having and that we
 
03:50:03.910 --> 03:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
didn't have enough property
 
03:50:08.769 --> 03:50:08.779 align:start position:0%
and the discussion then pursued on
 
03:50:13.450 --> 03:50:13.460 align:start position:0%
the town swapping land and then in turn
 
03:50:16.090 --> 03:50:16.100 align:start position:0%
receiving the courthouse
 
03:50:19.130 --> 03:50:19.140 align:start position:0%
and for the number of years
 
03:50:22.010 --> 03:50:22.020 align:start position:0%
I don't know where the actual cost
 
03:50:26.990 --> 03:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
breakout is the value of each but it's
 
03:50:29.030 --> 03:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
been ongoing and going on for several
 
03:50:32.929 --> 03:50:32.939 align:start position:0%
years and I was okay at this point Chris
 
03:50:35.990 --> 03:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
would you have anything to add to that
 
03:50:38.389 --> 03:50:38.399 align:start position:0%
I don't I think you've covered it I mean
 
03:50:41.210 --> 03:50:41.220 align:start position:0%
if it currently they would need to go
 
03:50:43.790 --> 03:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
through the long-range committee to
 
03:50:52.490 --> 03:50:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:55.490 --> 03:50:55.500 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman yes please representative if
 
03:50:57.590 --> 03:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
I could inform the committee as to what
 
03:51:00.290 --> 03:51:00.300 align:start position:0%
I understand is going on
 
03:51:02.330 --> 03:51:02.340 align:start position:0%
can I do that
 
03:51:04.490 --> 03:51:04.500 align:start position:0%
um if it stays in the Realms of
 
03:51:06.710 --> 03:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
information we can discuss yes
 
03:51:09.469 --> 03:51:09.479 align:start position:0%
um yeah the
 
03:51:12.410 --> 03:51:12.420 align:start position:0%
I don't know as representative Kaczynski
 
03:51:14.389 --> 03:51:14.399 align:start position:0%
said how much the what you do with the
 
03:51:16.729 --> 03:51:16.739 align:start position:0%
old building how much it matters
 
03:51:19.910 --> 03:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
with this appropriation and it may not I
 
03:51:21.650 --> 03:51:21.660 align:start position:0%
do agree with the 17-5 for new
 
03:51:23.809 --> 03:51:23.819 align:start position:0%
courthouse I think we need it
 
03:51:26.809 --> 03:51:26.819 align:start position:0%
the problem I have
 
03:51:29.210 --> 03:51:29.220 align:start position:0%
is the state in the last two years for
 
03:51:31.910 --> 03:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
six hundred thousand into the existing
 
03:51:34.070 --> 03:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
courthouse building
 
03:51:37.790 --> 03:51:37.800 align:start position:0%
and what the city wants to do is they
 
03:51:40.610 --> 03:51:40.620 align:start position:0%
want to get that courthouse building in
 
03:51:43.309 --> 03:51:43.319 align:start position:0%
exchange for property that was valued
 
03:51:46.010 --> 03:51:46.020 align:start position:0%
and from what I believe to be seventy
 
03:51:48.110 --> 03:51:48.120 align:start position:0%
nine thousand dollars
 
03:51:50.570 --> 03:51:50.580 align:start position:0%
now the city we were told at a meeting
 
03:51:52.490 --> 03:51:52.500 align:start position:0%
the other night and I believe I incurred
 
03:51:53.809 --> 03:51:53.819 align:start position:0%
what I heard
 
03:51:57.170 --> 03:51:57.180 align:start position:0%
the city has three people or three
 
03:51:59.389 --> 03:51:59.399 align:start position:0%
businesses that are interested in buying
 
03:52:01.130 --> 03:52:01.140 align:start position:0%
that building
 
03:52:03.170 --> 03:52:03.180 align:start position:0%
so the conundrum I've got is a state
 
03:52:05.090 --> 03:52:05.100 align:start position:0%
representative is should the state get
 
03:52:06.769 --> 03:52:06.779 align:start position:0%
as much as they can out of that building
 
03:52:09.229 --> 03:52:09.239 align:start position:0%
which I was led to believe they do when
 
03:52:11.030 --> 03:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
they sell the building
 
03:52:14.330 --> 03:52:14.340 align:start position:0%
or do we allow the city
 
03:52:17.750 --> 03:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:19.910 --> 03:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
to trade a piece of property that was
 
03:52:24.349 --> 03:52:24.359 align:start position:0%
they basically got you know 79 000 into
 
03:52:26.630 --> 03:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
just to sell it to somebody they've got
 
03:52:28.130 --> 03:52:28.140 align:start position:0%
three people that are interested in
 
03:52:29.809 --> 03:52:29.819 align:start position:0%
buying the building and that's the
 
03:52:31.670 --> 03:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
conundrum I've got as a representative
 
03:52:34.790 --> 03:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
of the city should we do the best deal
 
03:52:37.969 --> 03:52:37.979 align:start position:0%
and the best interest for the city or as
 
03:52:39.710 --> 03:52:39.720 align:start position:0%
a state representative should we try to
 
03:52:42.710 --> 03:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
get the most money back to the state
 
03:52:44.809 --> 03:52:44.819 align:start position:0%
which I was led to believe what the
 
03:52:46.370 --> 03:52:46.380 align:start position:0%
state does with buildings when they sell
 
03:52:47.990 --> 03:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
them they get them appraised and they
 
03:52:50.150 --> 03:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
try to get what they're worth so this is
 
03:52:52.190 --> 03:52:52.200 align:start position:0%
a conundrum I'm I've got right now on
 
03:52:54.710 --> 03:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
how to move forward with this
 
03:52:57.830 --> 03:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
okay I just want to mention that
 
03:53:00.769 --> 03:53:00.779 align:start position:0%
the um the value of the land in the swap
 
03:53:04.550 --> 03:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
is an item that comes through long range
 
03:53:04.560 --> 03:53:05.330 align:start position:0%
is an item that comes through long range
um

03:53:05.330 --> 03:53:05.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:07.250 --> 03:53:07.260 align:start position:0%
long range
 
03:53:12.170 --> 03:53:12.180 align:start position:0%
committee Capital planning and the value
 
03:53:15.650 --> 03:53:15.660 align:start position:0%
of of what a building receives when it's
 
03:53:19.070 --> 03:53:19.080 align:start position:0%
sold is is not a matter of this
 
03:53:21.590 --> 03:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
committee it's a matter for you as a
 
03:53:24.410 --> 03:53:24.420 align:start position:0%
state representative I'm sure but this
 
03:53:26.510 --> 03:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
this number that's in here the 17
 
03:53:29.630 --> 03:53:29.640 align:start position:0%
million five hundred thousand dollars is
 
03:53:31.490 --> 03:53:31.500 align:start position:0%
is a separate item
 
03:53:31.500 --> 03:53:33.290 align:start position:0%
is a separate item
and

03:53:33.290 --> 03:53:33.300 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:53:39.590 --> 03:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
there is uh from my time on disposing of
 
03:53:43.550 --> 03:53:43.560 align:start position:0%
of property goes through a process of
 
03:53:46.729 --> 03:53:46.739 align:start position:0%
who has the right to request the
 
03:53:49.910 --> 03:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
purchase of that and sometimes
 
03:53:53.570 --> 03:53:53.580 align:start position:0%
um those those are done
 
03:53:55.550 --> 03:53:55.560 align:start position:0%
at a different value for a different
 
03:54:00.349 --> 03:54:00.359 align:start position:0%
agency as far as the um as far as what
 
03:54:02.750 --> 03:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
that final cost is if it then ends up
 
03:54:05.210 --> 03:54:05.220 align:start position:0%
going out to the public is done by
 
03:54:07.490 --> 03:54:07.500 align:start position:0%
appraisal process but that comes through
 
03:54:11.210 --> 03:54:11.220 align:start position:0%
that long-range Capital uh committee and
 
03:54:13.969 --> 03:54:13.979 align:start position:0%
and not through this committee
 
03:54:15.710 --> 03:54:15.720 align:start position:0%
representative Faulkner and then I'll
 
03:54:16.729 --> 03:54:16.739 align:start position:0%
come back to you but I think that
 
03:54:18.290 --> 03:54:18.300 align:start position:0%
answers my question but my understanding
 
03:54:20.809 --> 03:54:20.819 align:start position:0%
is that if a surplus property is sold
 
03:54:22.490 --> 03:54:22.500 align:start position:0%
that money comes back into the general
 
03:54:25.010 --> 03:54:25.020 align:start position:0%
fund it doesn't offset the amount that
 
03:54:27.349 --> 03:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
has to be bonded all right
 
03:54:31.490 --> 03:54:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:33.950 --> 03:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
follow-up well just that there was a
 
03:54:35.809 --> 03:54:35.819 align:start position:0%
another item that nobody's that wasn't
 
03:54:37.370 --> 03:54:37.380 align:start position:0%
mentioned and that's
 
03:54:40.189 --> 03:54:40.199 align:start position:0%
the uh run around and not going through
 
03:54:42.710 --> 03:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
the wrong long range planning which you
 
03:54:44.990 --> 03:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
spoke with me the other day and that
 
03:54:46.550 --> 03:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
would be if somebody on the committee a
 
03:54:50.210 --> 03:54:50.220 align:start position:0%
conference adds a line to the budget
 
03:54:53.090 --> 03:54:53.100 align:start position:0%
and says we're going to trade even for
 
03:54:54.889 --> 03:54:54.899 align:start position:0%
the land and that could go all around
 
03:54:58.429 --> 03:54:58.439 align:start position:0%
the long-range planning process
 
03:55:00.650 --> 03:55:00.660 align:start position:0%
I I don't know the answer to that to be
 
03:55:00.660 --> 03:55:01.849 align:start position:0%
I I don't know the answer to that to be
honest

03:55:01.849 --> 03:55:01.859 align:start position:0%
honest
 
03:55:03.530 --> 03:55:03.540 align:start position:0%
someone else I just wanted to bring it
 
03:55:07.250 --> 03:55:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:09.170 --> 03:55:09.180 align:start position:0%
any other further discussion on the
 
03:55:11.630 --> 03:55:11.640 align:start position:0%
Rochester Courthouse yes representative
 
03:55:14.710 --> 03:55:14.720 align:start position:0%
Jack thank you there was an item in 19
 
03:55:18.410 --> 03:55:18.420 align:start position:0%
to replace the boilers that project is
 
03:55:21.050 --> 03:55:21.060 align:start position:0%
complete there's an item 21 for the
 
03:55:22.670 --> 03:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
design money for this
 
03:55:26.030 --> 03:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
so that's already been appropriated
 
03:55:30.889 --> 03:55:30.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:33.290 --> 03:55:33.300 align:start position:0%
representative just a clarification that
 
03:55:35.330 --> 03:55:35.340 align:start position:0%
the city of Rochester is going to
 
03:55:38.330 --> 03:55:38.340 align:start position:0%
acquire the courthouse and then
 
03:55:40.490 --> 03:55:40.500 align:start position:0%
try to sell it or do they have a
 
03:55:42.410 --> 03:55:42.420 align:start position:0%
specific does the city of Rochester and
 
03:55:44.809 --> 03:55:44.819 align:start position:0%
maybe this is Curiosity on my pot I want
 
03:55:46.969 --> 03:55:46.979 align:start position:0%
to repurpose that building for
 
03:55:50.330 --> 03:55:50.340 align:start position:0%
the cities and the residents uses my my
 
03:55:52.790 --> 03:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the city will
 
03:55:54.710 --> 03:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
retain the building
 
03:55:58.130 --> 03:55:58.140 align:start position:0%
okay thank you no that that Mr chairman
 
03:55:59.630 --> 03:55:59.640 align:start position:0%
that's all we were told at the meeting
 
03:56:01.910 --> 03:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
the other night at the city
 
03:56:04.130 --> 03:56:04.140 align:start position:0%
we're told by the economics development
 
03:56:05.929 --> 03:56:05.939 align:start position:0%
director that there are three three
 
03:56:07.849 --> 03:56:07.859 align:start position:0%
parties interested in purchasing the
 
03:56:10.010 --> 03:56:10.020 align:start position:0%
building from the city
 
03:56:13.309 --> 03:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
I I heard I heard that okay and that
 
03:56:14.990 --> 03:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
would that would then be a matter of the
 
03:56:15.000 --> 03:56:16.309 align:start position:0%
would that would then be a matter of the
city

03:59:41.210 --> 03:59:41.220 align:start position:0%
and uh representative Newman brings up a
 
03:59:42.530 --> 03:59:42.540 align:start position:0%
good point
 
03:59:44.990 --> 03:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
um we're just looking for agreement at
 
03:59:47.269 --> 03:59:47.279 align:start position:0%
this point running through these
 
03:59:50.330 --> 03:59:50.340 align:start position:0%
Department lists and the governors and
 
03:59:52.490 --> 03:59:52.500 align:start position:0%

discuss those afterwards okay
 
04:00:04.910 --> 04:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
because there might be and I of course I
 
04:00:06.710 --> 04:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
believe we're are we waiting for
 
04:00:10.309 --> 04:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
something from Corrections an update or
 
04:00:12.769 --> 04:00:12.779 align:start position:0%
on the the kitchen situation or we don't
 
04:00:14.510 --> 04:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
know anything about that
 
04:00:16.490 --> 04:00:16.500 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe you were waiting on
 
04:00:18.769 --> 04:00:18.779 align:start position:0%
the kitchen okay
 
04:00:20.450 --> 04:00:20.460 align:start position:0%
somebody would have to correct me but I
 
04:00:21.590 --> 04:00:21.600 align:start position:0%
don't recall that they were coming back
 
04:00:24.889 --> 04:00:24.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:24.899 --> 04:00:26.809 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:00:26.809 --> 04:00:26.819 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:00:30.050 --> 04:00:30.060 align:start position:0%
so um so we're at one million three
 
04:00:32.030 --> 04:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
hundred and ten thousand dollars if
 
04:00:34.429 --> 04:00:34.439 align:start position:0%
you're a favor of Department Corrections
 
04:00:36.650 --> 04:00:36.660 align:start position:0%
requests as we see them now signify
 
04:00:42.769 --> 04:00:42.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:49.330 --> 04:00:49.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:52.969 --> 04:00:52.979 align:start position:0%
Department of Education line 18 acquired
 
04:00:55.510 --> 04:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
building at 25 Hall Street
 
04:00:59.630 --> 04:00:59.640 align:start position:0%
the the original request was for ten
 
04:01:02.150 --> 04:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
thousand five hundred which we have now
 
04:01:06.590 --> 04:01:06.600 align:start position:0%
10 million 500 000 which we now have
 
04:01:09.469 --> 04:01:09.479 align:start position:0%
changed to seven million seven million
 
04:01:09.479 --> 04:01:12.250 align:start position:0%
changed to seven million seven million
dollars

04:01:12.250 --> 04:01:12.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:15.769 --> 04:01:15.779 align:start position:0%
which is their only request here so it
 
04:01:17.990 --> 04:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
would change the line on General funded
 
04:01:20.990 --> 04:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
portion to seven million dollars any
 
04:01:24.889 --> 04:01:24.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:28.070 --> 04:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
yes represent blood
 
04:01:29.269 --> 04:01:29.279 align:start position:0%
so if the Department of Education
 
04:01:30.590 --> 04:01:30.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't but I say they would continue
 
04:01:32.689 --> 04:01:32.699 align:start position:0%
leasing the building
 
04:01:35.269 --> 04:01:35.279 align:start position:0%
that was we heard that at the testimony
 
04:01:37.849 --> 04:01:37.859 align:start position:0%
I think from last time no they would
 
04:01:37.859 --> 04:01:39.050 align:start position:0%
I think from last time no they would
move

04:01:39.050 --> 04:01:39.060 align:start position:0%
move
 
04:01:43.689 --> 04:01:43.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:48.309 --> 04:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:52.429 --> 04:01:52.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:54.229 --> 04:01:54.239 align:start position:0%
all right if you're in favor of
 
04:01:55.790 --> 04:01:55.800 align:start position:0%

04:02:11.809 --> 04:02:11.819 align:start position:0%
let's hold off on that
 
04:02:11.819 --> 04:02:12.950 align:start position:0%
let's hold off on that

04:03:20.150 --> 04:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
match
 
04:03:24.650 --> 04:03:24.660 align:start position:0%
shown as 11 million 361 thousand eight
 
04:03:27.050 --> 04:03:27.060 align:start position:0%
seventy one
 
04:03:38.590 --> 04:03:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:42.950 --> 04:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
which looks to be a total on the
 
04:03:45.769 --> 04:03:45.779 align:start position:0%
governor's side of 29 million six
 
04:03:48.110 --> 04:03:48.120 align:start position:0%

04:04:08.389 --> 04:04:08.399 align:start position:0%
so corrected would be uh 29 million five
 
04:04:11.090 --> 04:04:11.100 align:start position:0%
hundred ninety eight thousand zero up to
 
04:04:14.150 --> 04:04:14.160 align:start position:0%

representative Newman
 
04:04:21.469 --> 04:04:21.479 align:start position:0%
yes this probably came up along the way
 
04:04:24.110 --> 04:04:24.120 align:start position:0%
and I I just don't have it in my head
 
04:04:26.809 --> 04:04:26.819 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the again in the Blue

the drinking water State revolving match
 
04:04:36.349 --> 04:04:36.359 align:start position:0%
at 10 488 and then 11 361 they're in
 
04:04:38.870 --> 04:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
here at different numbers 13.
 
04:04:42.290 --> 04:04:42.300 align:start position:0%

um HQ Life Safety improvements

parking lot renovation and roof yes
 
04:10:25.969 --> 04:10:25.979 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that request is um
 
04:10:27.769 --> 04:10:27.779 align:start position:0%
as they testified that they're in the
 
04:10:30.229 --> 04:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
process of redoing the parking lot
 
04:10:31.189 --> 04:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
um originally they thought they were
 
04:10:32.510 --> 04:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
just gonna have it repaved but they
 
04:10:34.490 --> 04:10:34.500 align:start position:0%
found there was some issues underground
 
04:10:35.990 --> 04:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
that they need to address in order to
 
04:10:37.189 --> 04:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
repave it
 
04:10:39.349 --> 04:10:39.359 align:start position:0%
so that appropriation that they have for
 
04:10:41.150 --> 04:10:41.160 align:start position:0%
the parking lot was also meant for the
 
04:10:41.160 --> 04:10:42.650 align:start position:0%
the parking lot was also meant for the
roof

04:10:42.650 --> 04:10:42.660 align:start position:0%
roof
 
04:10:44.630 --> 04:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
they believe they're going to expend the
 
04:10:46.070 --> 04:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
appropriation they currently have for
 
04:10:47.450 --> 04:10:47.460 align:start position:0%
the parking lot and may need a little
 
04:10:48.830 --> 04:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
bit more
 
04:10:51.170 --> 04:10:51.180 align:start position:0%
they're not sure if they need to do how
 
04:10:52.370 --> 04:10:52.380 align:start position:0%
much they need to do with the roof if
 
04:10:55.429 --> 04:10:55.439 align:start position:0%
anything so they had asked that both the
 
04:10:57.830 --> 04:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
parking and the roof be included in this
 
04:10:57.840 --> 04:10:58.790 align:start position:0%

04:11:06.830 --> 04:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
because it's an old building they're
 
04:11:08.090 --> 04:11:08.100 align:start position:0%

04:11:08.100 --> 04:11:09.410 align:start position:0%

a node or this will be changed
 
04:11:19.189 --> 04:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
if the committee is okay with me making
 
04:11:21.590 --> 04:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
the change I would make that change in
 
04:11:24.050 --> 04:11:24.060 align:start position:0%
in the final budget that you see okay
 
04:11:25.969 --> 04:11:25.979 align:start position:0%

04:12:14.689 --> 04:12:14.699 align:start position:0%
the one you just approved related to the
 
04:12:17.150 --> 04:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
headquarters title when I update this
 
04:12:19.670 --> 04:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
document you'll see the name change in
 
04:12:22.130 --> 04:12:22.140 align:start position:0%
there is it in here the one that's only
 
04:12:23.809 --> 04:12:23.819 align:start position:0%
showing the Amendments is it in there no
 
04:12:25.490 --> 04:12:25.500 align:start position:0%
no that was for the some other changes
 
04:12:27.710 --> 04:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
but that's just kind of explaining why I
 
04:12:29.870 --> 04:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
gave you that when I update this
 
04:12:32.870 --> 04:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
document you'll see the name change to
 
04:12:34.550 --> 04:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
this project and you'll see references
 
04:12:35.870 --> 04:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
to those amendments that you've straw
 
04:12:38.210 --> 04:12:38.220 align:start position:0%
pulled to say that this project has been
 
04:12:41.570 --> 04:12:41.580 align:start position:0%
uh potentially amended Mr Shaman I just
 
04:12:43.849 --> 04:12:43.859 align:start position:0%
want to say that when I vote for
 
04:12:45.349 --> 04:12:45.359 align:start position:0%
something I like to be able to read what
 
04:12:48.110 --> 04:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
exactly what I'm voting for and I thank
 
04:12:49.429 --> 04:12:49.439 align:start position:0%
you for being able to get that
 
04:12:51.290 --> 04:12:51.300 align:start position:0%
information to me before we make a final
 
04:12:53.229 --> 04:12:53.239 align:start position:0%
vote thank you again
 
04:12:55.790 --> 04:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
and thank you for that comment and the
 
04:12:57.950 --> 04:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
intent is that we'll be here Friday when
 
04:13:00.290 --> 04:13:00.300 align:start position:0%
we start working through this
 
04:13:02.630 --> 04:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
Friday or Monday
 
04:13:07.250 --> 04:13:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:09.349 --> 04:13:09.359 align:start position:0%
so I don't think we got did we get to
 
04:13:12.349 --> 04:13:12.359 align:start position:0%
the we did all right Lottery Commission
 
04:13:14.689 --> 04:13:14.699 align:start position:0%
building improvements
 
04:13:14.699 --> 04:13:19.450 align:start position:0%
building improvements
yeah

04:13:19.450 --> 04:13:19.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:21.710 --> 04:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
you've already done that when you zero
 
04:13:24.050 --> 04:13:24.060 align:start position:0%
thank you all right Lottery Commission
 
04:13:26.870 --> 04:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
we zeroed out from 875
 
04:13:29.630 --> 04:13:29.640 align:start position:0%
000 to zero so I think we've already
 
04:13:31.309 --> 04:13:31.319 align:start position:0%
taken care of that
 
04:13:34.849 --> 04:13:34.859 align:start position:0%
uh we'll move on to 61 military Affairs

04:14:59.330 --> 04:14:59.340 align:start position:0%
we have the line 68 which is
 
04:15:03.070 --> 04:15:03.080 align:start position:0%
um Nashua hazardous material remediation
 
04:15:07.790 --> 04:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
for four hundred thousand dollars
 
04:15:12.170 --> 04:15:12.180 align:start position:0%
so the general funded portion is on line
 
04:15:15.229 --> 04:15:15.239 align:start position:0%

04:15:17.269 --> 04:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
04:15:20.450 --> 04:15:20.460 align:start position:0%
Mr chair before you take a vote please
 
04:15:23.889 --> 04:15:23.899 align:start position:0%
I'll defer to represent belong
 
04:15:26.689 --> 04:15:26.699 align:start position:0%
just a quick uh question about the
 
04:15:28.309 --> 04:15:28.319 align:start position:0%
funding is there a funding formula so
 
04:15:31.429 --> 04:15:31.439 align:start position:0%
it's 75 25 because I'm just I just did a
 
04:15:34.070 --> 04:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
quick calculation on that is that yes
 
04:15:35.990 --> 04:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
that's the federal government tells them
 
04:15:39.290 --> 04:15:39.300 align:start position:0%
that they'll pay 75 or 50 percent or a
 
04:15:41.570 --> 04:15:41.580 align:start position:0%
hundred percent of certain projects and
 
04:15:43.309 --> 04:15:43.319 align:start position:0%
then they come and ask for the required
 
04:15:46.670 --> 04:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
match okay whatever percentage did you
 
04:15:48.769 --> 04:15:48.779 align:start position:0%
have anything else to add on those I I
 
04:15:50.570 --> 04:15:50.580 align:start position:0%
did before
 
04:15:50.580 --> 04:15:51.229 align:start position:0%
did before
um

04:15:51.229 --> 04:15:51.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:53.090 --> 04:15:53.100 align:start position:0%
if you recall when the department came
 
04:15:55.969 --> 04:15:55.979 align:start position:0%
in on line 68 the Nashua hazardous
 
04:15:58.910 --> 04:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
material remediation they had requested
 
04:16:01.870 --> 04:16:01.880 align:start position:0%
if you look at the two-page sheet
 
04:16:06.950 --> 04:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
on page two line 31 and 32 they had
 
04:16:08.809 --> 04:16:08.819 align:start position:0%
requested to reduce the four hundred
 
04:16:11.269 --> 04:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to two hundred and
 
04:16:13.070 --> 04:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars
 
04:16:15.110 --> 04:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
and use that hundred and fifty thousand
 
04:16:18.229 --> 04:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
dollars for land purchase Pembroke so it
 
04:16:20.389 --> 04:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
was a net zero but they just wanted to
 
04:16:21.710 --> 04:16:21.720 align:start position:0%
add that
 
04:16:23.450 --> 04:16:23.460 align:start position:0%
just wanted to remind the committee of
 
04:16:24.950 --> 04:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
that in case you wanted to consider it
 
04:16:26.689 --> 04:16:26.699 align:start position:0%
as your cons it doesn't change the total
 
04:16:29.590 --> 04:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
it just changes the projects
 
04:16:33.349 --> 04:16:33.359 align:start position:0%
yes representative Kaczynski
 
04:16:35.630 --> 04:16:35.640 align:start position:0%
um yeah I just when that was presented
 
04:16:36.889 --> 04:16:36.899 align:start position:0%
to us
 
04:16:39.110 --> 04:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
it's not I don't know I didn't quite
 
04:16:41.330 --> 04:16:41.340 align:start position:0%
agree with the fact that they found some
 
04:16:43.670 --> 04:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste in the land and they
 
04:16:45.110 --> 04:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
were allowed just to keep it there if
 
04:16:47.150 --> 04:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
they didn't disturb it that's what he
 
04:16:51.170 --> 04:16:51.180 align:start position:0%
said the cost would be the 400 000. I I
 
04:16:54.110 --> 04:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
don't know I don't quite go go for that
 
04:16:54.120 --> 04:16:56.630 align:start position:0%
don't know I don't quite go go for that
myself

04:16:56.630 --> 04:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:59.150 --> 04:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
I I can't answer why they're able to do
 
04:17:00.950 --> 04:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
that except it's a military base and
 
04:17:03.530 --> 04:17:03.540 align:start position:0%
maybe there's certain rules and
 
04:17:05.510 --> 04:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
procedures that they can follow that
 
04:17:07.849 --> 04:17:07.859 align:start position:0%
maybe on the outside of the base that
 
04:17:09.889 --> 04:17:09.899 align:start position:0%
businesses and others wouldn't be
 
04:17:11.330 --> 04:17:11.340 align:start position:0%
allowed to follow but I can't speak
 
04:17:11.340 --> 04:17:13.189 align:start position:0%
allowed to follow but I can't speak
specifically

04:17:13.189 --> 04:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
04:17:17.389 --> 04:17:17.399 align:start position:0%
um to why the the military Affairs can
 
04:17:19.910 --> 04:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
um basically cap it and not disturb it
 
04:17:23.870 --> 04:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:26.330 --> 04:17:26.340 align:start position:0%
yes I'm going to represent below
 
04:17:28.670 --> 04:17:28.680 align:start position:0%
thank you just so in Epping we had an
 
04:17:30.889 --> 04:17:30.899 align:start position:0%
issue with um some hazardous waste
 
04:17:33.710 --> 04:17:33.720 align:start position:0%
because it's such a little closer to the
 
04:17:35.990 --> 04:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
microphone I'm sorry because there's so
 
04:17:37.610 --> 04:17:37.620 align:start position:0%
much uh clay
 
04:17:40.490 --> 04:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
so you can do clay caps I mean
 
04:17:42.290 --> 04:17:42.300 align:start position:0%
not that I feel very confident with that
 
04:17:44.510 --> 04:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
but that is one of the the methods of
 
04:17:46.370 --> 04:17:46.380 align:start position:0%
dealing with hazardous waste is that if
 
04:17:49.130 --> 04:17:49.140 align:start position:0%
it is completely covered
 
04:17:51.469 --> 04:17:51.479 align:start position:0%
within a clay deposit then if you don't
 
04:17:53.689 --> 04:17:53.699 align:start position:0%
disturb it then it won't go anywhere so
 
04:17:54.830 --> 04:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
that's I mean that's just my own
 
04:17:56.269 --> 04:17:56.279 align:start position:0%
speculation on that but that's one of
 
04:17:58.030 --> 04:17:58.040 align:start position:0%
the things that I've seen in the past
 
04:18:02.269 --> 04:18:02.279 align:start position:0%
and on a much more General basis for
 
04:18:04.969 --> 04:18:04.979 align:start position:0%
most of us encapsulating lead paint and
 
04:18:07.670 --> 04:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
other items as opposed to removing them
 
04:18:09.349 --> 04:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
you know is another standard practice
 
04:18:12.290 --> 04:18:12.300 align:start position:0%
where it's so expensive so
 
04:18:12.300 --> 04:18:14.809 align:start position:0%
where it's so expensive so
um

04:18:14.809 --> 04:18:14.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:17.269 --> 04:18:17.279 align:start position:0%
I don't want to say the word
 
04:18:20.150 --> 04:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
um I have full faith in in my government
 
04:18:20.160 --> 04:18:21.490 align:start position:0%
um I have full faith in in my government
but

04:18:21.490 --> 04:18:21.500 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:18:24.650 --> 04:18:24.660 align:start position:0%
it's it seems it seems to be a standard
 
04:18:27.010 --> 04:18:27.020 align:start position:0%
practice representative
 
04:18:29.330 --> 04:18:29.340 align:start position:0%
represent yours just briefly in this
 
04:18:32.030 --> 04:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
case in this location uh
 
04:18:34.130 --> 04:18:34.140 align:start position:0%
but what it might be uh for anyone's
 
04:18:36.110 --> 04:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
interest is there are homes within about
 
04:18:37.309 --> 04:18:37.319 align:start position:0%
100 feet
 
04:18:38.870 --> 04:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
of that
 
04:18:43.250 --> 04:18:43.260 align:start position:0%
that location so if I recall from the
 
04:18:44.750 --> 04:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
presentation yeah they're going to
 
04:18:47.630 --> 04:18:47.640 align:start position:0%
monitor cap it look at it cap it and
 
04:18:50.150 --> 04:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
monitor it with with those funds that
 
04:18:52.750 --> 04:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
were that were being allocated
 
04:18:54.830 --> 04:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
right representative Jack did you have
 
04:18:57.110 --> 04:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
something yes yeah I was going to ask if
 
04:18:58.969 --> 04:18:58.979 align:start position:0%
a motion would be in order to make this
 
04:19:00.710 --> 04:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
change that's on the
 
04:19:03.650 --> 04:19:03.660 align:start position:0%
requested chain sheet please all right
 
04:19:09.950 --> 04:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:12.170 --> 04:19:12.180 align:start position:0%
to read two hundred and fifty thousand
 
04:19:12.180 --> 04:19:14.510 align:start position:0%

04:27:42.170 --> 04:27:42.180 align:start position:0%
okay could you repeat that one more time
 
04:27:44.809 --> 04:27:44.819 align:start position:0%
please yep so the federal portion will
 
04:27:47.210 --> 04:27:47.220 align:start position:0%
be six nine
 
04:27:50.630 --> 04:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
six six four six
 
04:27:56.330 --> 04:27:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:59.450 --> 04:27:59.460 align:start position:0%
yes representative for the record how is
 
04:28:01.550 --> 04:28:01.560 align:start position:0%
it that we get 70 million dollars in
 
04:28:03.229 --> 04:28:03.239 align:start position:0%
federal funds with only matching it with
 
04:28:03.239 --> 04:28:04.729 align:start position:0%
federal funds with only matching it with
1.2

04:28:04.729 --> 04:28:04.739 align:start position:0%
1.2
 
04:28:07.429 --> 04:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
million is that that's
 
04:28:09.530 --> 04:28:09.540 align:start position:0%
seems to be out of the range of most of
 
04:28:12.769 --> 04:28:12.779 align:start position:0%
the funding ratios some of those are
 
04:28:14.510 --> 04:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
representative Jack did you want yeah
 
04:28:16.490 --> 04:28:16.500 align:start position:0%

04:28:20.090 --> 04:28:20.100 align:start position:0%

percent State match
 
04:28:28.010 --> 04:28:28.020 align:start position:0%
so what we're appropriating here is the
 
04:28:32.389 --> 04:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:35.510 --> 04:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
in addition the infrastructure Act
 
04:28:37.790 --> 04:28:37.800 align:start position:0%
has re lowered the match requirement for
 
04:28:39.769 --> 04:28:39.779 align:start position:0%
some of the funds that are coming in so
 
04:28:41.630 --> 04:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
if you have the Department's uh booked
 
04:28:43.490 --> 04:28:43.500 align:start position:0%
with this cover on it
 
04:28:45.170 --> 04:28:45.180 align:start position:0%
if you look at
 
04:28:47.750 --> 04:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
um page two
 
04:28:49.729 --> 04:28:49.739 align:start position:0%
it's in the small print that talks about
 
04:28:52.010 --> 04:28:52.020 align:start position:0%
the project justification but it it
 
04:28:53.809 --> 04:28:53.819 align:start position:0%
explains there why the match has
 
04:28:55.490 --> 04:28:55.500 align:start position:0%
decreased from the normal five percent
 
04:28:59.570 --> 04:28:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:01.610 --> 04:29:01.620 align:start position:0%
it's a shame it's not more of those
 
04:29:04.309 --> 04:29:04.319 align:start position:0%
isn't it all right so every everyone's
 
04:29:06.830 --> 04:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
aware of what the new number is
 
04:29:10.010 --> 04:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
uh clerk do you have the number for
 
04:29:11.929 --> 04:29:11.939 align:start position:0%

04:29:21.050 --> 04:29:21.060 align:start position:0%
any further question on that
 
04:29:23.149 --> 04:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
representative Kaczynski well I just
 
04:29:26.929 --> 04:29:26.939 align:start position:0%
wrote down one one million 192. I hear
 
04:29:29.870 --> 04:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
that wrong before it's one six we'll
 
04:29:33.410 --> 04:29:33.420 align:start position:0%
double check our number no there um if
 
04:29:35.630 --> 04:29:35.640 align:start position:0%
you if I might that was the the new
 
04:29:37.969 --> 04:29:37.979 align:start position:0%
number for when you reduced on line 98
 
04:29:40.550 --> 04:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
the number that was just mentioned was
 
04:29:44.570 --> 04:29:44.580 align:start position:0%
the total of 98 and 99 so it's the one
 
04:29:48.610 --> 04:29:48.620 align:start position:0%
one nine two 109 plus the 570.
 
04:29:52.189 --> 04:29:52.199 align:start position:0%

yeah okay

and if we go to with that would be 17
 
04:31:57.189 --> 04:31:57.199 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
04:32:00.769 --> 04:32:00.779 align:start position:0%
and if General funds portion is 17
 
04:32:03.769 --> 04:32:03.779 align:start position:0%
million dollars and this 17 million
 
04:32:06.170 --> 04:32:06.180 align:start position:0%
dollars is carrying over from
 
04:32:09.229 --> 04:32:09.239 align:start position:0%
the final of
 
04:32:13.670 --> 04:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
the keep project so back in 2019 uh this
 
04:32:16.309 --> 04:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
committee agreed with the university to
 
04:32:18.110 --> 04:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate a total of 42 million
 
04:32:20.570 --> 04:32:20.580 align:start position:0%
dollars over three bienniums
 
04:32:22.670 --> 04:32:22.680 align:start position:0%
first year was 10 million or the first
 
04:32:25.250 --> 04:32:25.260 align:start position:0%
biennium was 10 million second biennium
 
04:32:27.170 --> 04:32:27.180 align:start position:0%
which we're currently in is 15 million
 
04:32:29.510 --> 04:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
and the balance would be in 24 and 25
 
04:32:32.030 --> 04:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
which is 17 million and it's for
 
04:32:34.130 --> 04:32:34.140 align:start position:0%
projects that as you see in the line
 
04:32:37.490 --> 04:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
there at UNH Plymouth State and Keene
 
04:32:40.610 --> 04:32:40.620 align:start position:0%
and I believe when the university system
 
04:32:42.889 --> 04:32:42.899 align:start position:0%
came in they provided a pretty detailed
 
04:32:45.170 --> 04:32:45.180 align:start position:0%
document showing you their calendar and
 
04:32:46.490 --> 04:32:46.500 align:start position:0%
the match that they have to the state
 
04:32:49.309 --> 04:32:49.319 align:start position:0%
funds to complete these projects
 
04:32:51.469 --> 04:32:51.479 align:start position:0%
this is here to show the committee that
 
04:32:53.090 --> 04:32:53.100 align:start position:0%
the this appropriation has already been
 
04:32:53.100 --> 04:32:54.290 align:start position:0%
the this appropriation has already been
made

04:32:54.290 --> 04:32:54.300 align:start position:0%
made
 
04:32:58.550 --> 04:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
but it does affect your 24-25 capital
 
04:33:01.130 --> 04:33:01.140 align:start position:0%
budget appropriation and that's what you
 
04:33:05.029 --> 04:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
see on line 37 137 excuse me so you see
 
04:33:07.551 --> 04:33:07.561 align:start position:0%
that this total capital budget contains
 
04:33:09.529 --> 04:33:09.539 align:start position:0%
Appropriations for the general fund of
 
04:33:11.650 --> 04:33:11.660 align:start position:0%
129 million
 
04:33:11.660 --> 04:33:13.330 align:start position:0%
129 million
875

04:33:13.330 --> 04:33:13.340 align:start position:0%

04:33:25.510 --> 04:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:28.490 --> 04:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
so with that explanation the university
 
04:33:32.990 --> 04:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
system showing is a 17 million dollar uh
 
04:33:34.849 --> 04:33:34.859 align:start position:0%
obligation of your favor of that
 
04:33:37.849 --> 04:33:37.859 align:start position:0%
signified by raising your hand
 
04:33:37.859 --> 04:33:43.070 align:start position:0%

04:33:45.590 --> 04:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
all right so the find the final numbers
 
04:33:47.750 --> 04:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
we won't go on the final numbers there's
 
04:33:50.150 --> 04:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
adjustments that need to be made
 
04:33:53.090 --> 04:33:53.100 align:start position:0%
and so forth uh we'll wait for the
 
04:33:55.910 --> 04:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
documentation we're talking about to
 
04:33:58.010 --> 04:33:58.020 align:start position:0%
come back on Friday and then we can
 
04:34:00.529 --> 04:34:00.539 align:start position:0%
discuss that further
 
04:34:00.539 --> 04:34:01.609 align:start position:0%
discuss that further
um

04:34:01.609 --> 04:34:01.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:03.470 --> 04:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
we still have
 
04:34:06.349 --> 04:34:06.359 align:start position:0%
um time here
 
04:34:06.359 --> 04:34:07.429 align:start position:0%
um time here
um

04:34:07.429 --> 04:34:07.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:11.090 --> 04:34:11.100 align:start position:0%
I'd like to take a 10 minute break and
 
04:34:13.730 --> 04:34:13.740 align:start position:0%
then come back and uh
 
04:34:17.810 --> 04:34:17.820 align:start position:0%
discuss other the additional agency
 
04:34:19.670 --> 04:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
requests at that time
 
04:34:21.650 --> 04:34:21.660 align:start position:0%
our goal is to be out of here no later
 
04:34:23.390 --> 04:34:23.400 align:start position:0%
than four o'clock I don't know that
 
04:34:25.910 --> 04:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
we'll even be here that long
 
04:54:22.730 --> 04:54:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:24.350 --> 04:54:24.360 align:start position:0%
we'll get going in just a moment here
 
04:55:38.570 --> 04:55:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:41.150 --> 04:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
all right we will go in and I as I
 
04:55:42.650 --> 04:55:42.660 align:start position:0%
promise we're not going to be here past
 
04:55:44.510 --> 04:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
four o'clock so we'll go as far as we
 
04:55:47.090 --> 04:55:47.100 align:start position:0%
can uh let Chris make some adjustments
 
04:55:49.010 --> 04:55:49.020 align:start position:0%
so give us time to think about it and
 
04:55:51.590 --> 04:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
then we'll talk again on Friday
 
04:55:55.550 --> 04:55:55.560 align:start position:0%
so when we when we take in the savings
 
04:55:58.550 --> 04:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
that were found earlier
 
04:56:01.788 --> 04:56:01.798 align:start position:0%

if you add in the repurpose funds from

the lapse that gives us and there's it's
 
04:56:29.090 --> 04:56:29.100 align:start position:0%
a little might change just slightly but
 
04:56:31.670 --> 04:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
that's another three million eight
 
04:56:34.730 --> 04:56:34.740 align:start position:0%
hundred thirty thousand sixty three
 
04:56:34.740 --> 04:56:36.470 align:start position:0%
hundred thirty thousand sixty three
dollars

04:56:36.470 --> 04:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:56:40.070 --> 04:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
so we're sitting right now with the
 
04:56:43.990 --> 04:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
possibility of 14 million dollars
 
04:56:46.610 --> 04:56:46.620 align:start position:0%
fourteen hundred and thirty nine
 
04:56:48.770 --> 04:56:48.780 align:start position:0%
thousand two hundred and twenty nine
 
04:56:48.780 --> 04:56:51.230 align:start position:0%
thousand two hundred and twenty nine
dollars

04:56:51.230 --> 04:56:51.240 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:56:54.170 --> 04:56:54.180 align:start position:0%
we're we're going to uh we're going to
 
04:56:57.530 --> 04:56:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:00.050 --> 04:57:00.060 align:start position:0%
uh and we're going to go through the
 
04:57:02.628 --> 04:57:02.638 align:start position:0%
additional agency requests and talk
 
04:57:06.010 --> 04:57:06.020 align:start position:0%
about where monies might be appropriate
 
04:57:08.448 --> 04:57:08.458 align:start position:0%
appropriately placed
 
04:57:10.730 --> 04:57:10.740 align:start position:0%
I want you to bear in mind that this is
 
04:57:13.850 --> 04:57:13.860 align:start position:0%
really this is really highly unusual in
 
04:57:15.530 --> 04:57:15.540 align:start position:0%
my 20-year
 
04:57:19.010 --> 04:57:19.020 align:start position:0%
that I've been in and out of here in
 
04:57:22.670 --> 04:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
that if you remember what um our former
 
04:57:25.970 --> 04:57:25.980 align:start position:0%
chairman spoke about earlier
 
04:57:28.850 --> 04:57:28.860 align:start position:0%
um all the arpa funds that were brought
 
04:57:31.150 --> 04:57:31.160 align:start position:0%
into this process
 
04:57:34.250 --> 04:57:34.260 align:start position:0%
made it so much easier that we weren't
 
04:57:37.430 --> 04:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
fighting over so many more projects we
 
04:57:39.350 --> 04:57:39.360 align:start position:0%
know that there was a billion dollars
 
04:57:41.868 --> 04:57:41.878 align:start position:0%
worth of requests came down and you know
 
04:57:44.270 --> 04:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
we're in the neighborhood of 120
 
04:57:46.850 --> 04:57:46.860 align:start position:0%
000 120.
 
04:57:49.128 --> 04:57:49.138 align:start position:0%
um that we're we're going to appropriate
 
04:57:50.830 --> 04:57:50.840 align:start position:0%
out of here so
 
04:57:54.170 --> 04:57:54.180 align:start position:0%
I'd like to speak of some items that I
 
04:57:58.250 --> 04:57:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:01.730 --> 04:58:01.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:04.550 --> 04:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
we've said it several times it has
 
04:58:07.850 --> 04:58:07.860 align:start position:0%
always been our desire and we have
 
04:58:11.770 --> 04:58:11.780 align:start position:0%
worked extremely hard over my terms here
 
04:58:16.610 --> 04:58:16.620 align:start position:0%
to fund to CTE projects
 
04:58:18.830 --> 04:58:18.840 align:start position:0%
um one we were fortunate is coming
 
04:58:18.840 --> 04:58:20.110 align:start position:0%
um one we were fortunate is coming
through

04:58:20.110 --> 04:58:20.120 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:58:23.570 --> 04:58:23.580 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget not coming my not
 
04:58:25.430 --> 04:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
coming through us
 
04:58:28.190 --> 04:58:28.200 align:start position:0%
but they neglected to fund the
 
04:58:30.708 --> 04:58:30.718 align:start position:0%
winnisquam regional CTE Center
 
04:58:30.718 --> 04:58:34.010 align:start position:0%
winnisquam regional CTE Center
renovation

04:58:34.010 --> 04:58:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:36.650 --> 04:58:36.660 align:start position:0%
the and the governor said that he left
 
04:58:38.868 --> 04:58:38.878 align:start position:0%
it out of his request or didn't consider
 
04:58:42.170 --> 04:58:42.180 align:start position:0%
it because the the it was an unknown
 
04:58:45.230 --> 04:58:45.240 align:start position:0%
item of whether the town or the regional
 
04:58:48.470 --> 04:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
school was going to come up with their
 
04:58:51.350 --> 04:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
their appropriation of that so he left
 
04:58:52.550 --> 04:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
it off
 
04:58:56.690 --> 04:58:56.700 align:start position:0%
I've had conversations uh with the um
 
04:58:59.650 --> 04:58:59.660 align:start position:0%
with the director of that school
 
04:59:06.170 --> 04:59:06.180 align:start position:0%
and at last time it missed by a mere
 
04:59:07.850 --> 04:59:07.860 align:start position:0%
I think it was listed somewhere it
 
04:59:10.788 --> 04:59:10.798 align:start position:0%
missed by less than 11 votes to
 
04:59:13.030 --> 04:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate that money
 
04:59:16.570 --> 04:59:16.580 align:start position:0%
it is still a high priority for them
 
04:59:21.170 --> 04:59:21.180 align:start position:0%
they have held I think he told me three
 
04:59:24.770 --> 04:59:24.780 align:start position:0%
public sessions up till now uh talking
 
04:59:28.128 --> 04:59:28.138 align:start position:0%
to the people how important it is on
 
04:59:29.990 --> 04:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
their programs that they want to expand
 
04:59:31.850 --> 04:59:31.860 align:start position:0%
they're feeling much better about it
 
04:59:33.770 --> 04:59:33.780 align:start position:0%
they're actually doing another public
 
04:59:33.780 --> 04:59:35.230 align:start position:0%
they're actually doing another public
forum

04:59:35.230 --> 04:59:35.240 align:start position:0%
forum
 
04:59:39.590 --> 04:59:39.600 align:start position:0%
in two days and I believe the final vote
 
04:59:41.930 --> 04:59:41.940 align:start position:0%
of the school district happens on the
 
04:59:44.990 --> 04:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
27th of this month
 
04:59:47.330 --> 04:59:47.340 align:start position:0%
I think it's important to keep this
 
04:59:52.430 --> 04:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
project in our in our capital budget
 
04:59:55.670 --> 04:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
in the in the event that on the 27th
 
04:59:58.128 --> 04:59:58.138 align:start position:0%
let's say it didn't come true and that
 
05:00:00.288 --> 05:00:00.298 align:start position:0%
they weren't able to get their money
 
05:00:04.610 --> 05:00:04.620 align:start position:0%
I'm suggesting that Friday we develop a
 
05:00:08.170 --> 05:00:08.180 align:start position:0%
list of projects to Total seven million
 
05:00:11.090 --> 05:00:11.100 align:start position:0%
649 thousand dollars
 
05:00:14.090 --> 05:00:14.100 align:start position:0%
that in the event that this does not get
 
05:00:17.090 --> 05:00:17.100 align:start position:0%
approved that we pass it out of this
 
05:00:19.788 --> 05:00:19.798 align:start position:0%
house that this is where we want those
 
05:00:21.650 --> 05:00:21.660 align:start position:0%
Monies to go to
 
05:00:24.410 --> 05:00:24.420 align:start position:0%
we've done that in the past we did last
 
05:00:26.090 --> 05:00:26.100 align:start position:0%
time because there was all the
 
05:00:28.850 --> 05:00:28.860 align:start position:0%
uncertainty of the arpa funds we
 
05:00:31.310 --> 05:00:31.320 align:start position:0%
developed a list that Chris will
 
05:00:34.070 --> 05:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
developed for us and we passed that
 
05:00:36.850 --> 05:00:36.860 align:start position:0%
through the house and said to the Senate
 
05:00:39.830 --> 05:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
that these are our priorities if those
 
05:00:42.708 --> 05:00:42.718 align:start position:0%
monies come available so we've done this
 
05:00:44.270 --> 05:00:44.280 align:start position:0%
sort of thing before
 
05:00:46.310 --> 05:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
we could we could adopt the other
 
05:00:48.830 --> 05:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
position where we don't put this in our
 
05:00:51.830 --> 05:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
program in our budget and we put it on
 
05:00:54.230 --> 05:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
the side but it doesn't show anywhere
 
05:00:57.350 --> 05:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
near the strength of uh how important
 
05:01:00.788 --> 05:01:00.798 align:start position:0%
this is to us so I'm I'm hoping that
 
05:01:04.670 --> 05:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
you'll consider you'll consider keeping
 
05:01:07.250 --> 05:01:07.260 align:start position:0%
that project in there because if we only
 
05:01:10.670 --> 05:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
if we only start approving one CT
 
05:01:14.990 --> 05:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
project School a term uh it'll be over
 
05:01:17.090 --> 05:01:17.100 align:start position:0%
20 years before we get back to that
 
05:01:17.100 --> 05:01:17.868 align:start position:0%
20 years before we get back to that
school

05:01:17.868 --> 05:01:17.878 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:01:21.410 --> 05:01:21.420 align:start position:0%
and Technology changes buildings need to
 
05:01:24.288 --> 05:01:24.298 align:start position:0%
be upgraded and hopefully we're adapting
 
05:01:28.310 --> 05:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
to what's necessary in our Workforce so
 
05:01:30.830 --> 05:01:30.840 align:start position:0%
um so I'm going to propose that we move
 
05:01:34.090 --> 05:01:34.100 align:start position:0%
the winnisquam regional CTE Center
 
05:01:37.670 --> 05:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
renovation into this budget as part of
 
05:01:40.490 --> 05:01:40.500 align:start position:0%
that other monies that we spoke of
 
05:01:45.430 --> 05:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:48.830 --> 05:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
we'll do a straw
 
05:01:51.050 --> 05:01:51.060 align:start position:0%
uh any discussion on that before we do a
 
05:01:51.060 --> 05:01:52.610 align:start position:0%
uh any discussion on that before we do a
straw

05:01:52.610 --> 05:01:52.620 align:start position:0%
straw
 
05:01:55.128 --> 05:01:55.138 align:start position:0%
it's a quick question yes
 
05:01:57.530 --> 05:01:57.540 align:start position:0%
and that would be for 7 million
 
05:02:01.250 --> 05:02:01.260 align:start position:0%
approximately seven six yep seven six
 
05:02:03.770 --> 05:02:03.780 align:start position:0%
four nine six six three
 
05:02:07.550 --> 05:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
it's shown on um it's on the additional
 
05:02:11.570 --> 05:02:11.580 align:start position:0%
agency requests it's uh line ten
 
05:02:14.150 --> 05:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
got it thank you
 
05:02:17.570 --> 05:02:17.580 align:start position:0%
and this is deducted from the 14 million
 
05:02:19.250 --> 05:02:19.260 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
05:02:20.628 --> 05:02:20.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:02:23.628 --> 05:02:23.638 align:start position:0%
if if you're uh in favor of that if
 
05:02:25.128 --> 05:02:25.138 align:start position:0%
there's no further discussion if you're
 
05:02:27.350 --> 05:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
in favor of that signify by raising your
 
05:02:27.360 --> 05:02:29.690 align:start position:0%
in favor of that signify by raising your
hand

05:02:29.690 --> 05:02:29.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:32.750 --> 05:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:35.750 --> 05:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
next next area that we have been
 
05:02:38.030 --> 05:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
extremely supportive of
 
05:02:41.628 --> 05:02:41.638 align:start position:0%
is the community college system
 
05:02:43.970 --> 05:02:43.980 align:start position:0%
and the governor
 
05:02:43.980 --> 05:02:44.810 align:start position:0%
and the governor
um

05:02:44.810 --> 05:02:44.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:46.930 --> 05:02:46.940 align:start position:0%
was not funding
 
05:02:51.050 --> 05:02:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:51.060 --> 05:02:52.750 align:start position:0%
 
line

05:02:52.750 --> 05:02:52.760 align:start position:0%
line
 
05:02:59.208 --> 05:02:59.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:01.788 --> 05:03:01.798 align:start position:0%
and they have a request there for
 
05:03:06.550 --> 05:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:08.930 --> 05:03:08.940 align:start position:0%
3.3 million four hundred twenty five
 
05:03:11.690 --> 05:03:11.700 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and some change
 
05:03:14.150 --> 05:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
and they also had as one of their
 
05:03:18.050 --> 05:03:18.060 align:start position:0%
priorities which was line
 
05:03:20.628 --> 05:03:20.638 align:start position:0%
14 14.
 
05:03:23.090 --> 05:03:23.100 align:start position:0%
which was the respiratory therapy
 
05:03:25.430 --> 05:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
program teaching equipment and teaching
 
05:03:27.890 --> 05:03:27.900 align:start position:0%
space renovation
 
05:03:30.410 --> 05:03:30.420 align:start position:0%
again our committee has always been
 
05:03:33.230 --> 05:03:33.240 align:start position:0%
extremely supportive of of adding
 
05:03:37.070 --> 05:03:37.080 align:start position:0%
programs that are necessary and that we
 
05:03:39.050 --> 05:03:39.060 align:start position:0%
know the workforce New Hampshire
 
05:03:42.288 --> 05:03:42.298 align:start position:0%
Workforce is out there waiting for
 
05:03:45.770 --> 05:03:45.780 align:start position:0%
had a discussion with um with the
 
05:03:49.390 --> 05:03:49.400 align:start position:0%
community college system and I floated
 
05:03:49.400 --> 05:03:51.490 align:start position:0%
community college system and I floated
that

05:03:51.490 --> 05:03:51.500 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:03:55.128 --> 05:03:55.138 align:start position:0%
you know where where is your need is is
 
05:03:57.948 --> 05:03:57.958 align:start position:0%
the critical need over the what I
 
05:04:00.230 --> 05:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
perceived my need which was the
 
05:04:01.970 --> 05:04:01.980 align:start position:0%
expanding the program
 
05:04:05.448 --> 05:04:05.458 align:start position:0%
and if you if we were to find a one and
 
05:04:07.490 --> 05:04:07.500 align:start position:0%
a half million dollars
 
05:04:10.010 --> 05:04:10.020 align:start position:0%
to assist you where would you where
 
05:04:12.170 --> 05:04:12.180 align:start position:0%
would you spend that money
 
05:04:14.510 --> 05:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
and their day after a lot of thought
 
05:04:16.070 --> 05:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
they came back critical maintenance
 
05:04:19.850 --> 05:04:19.860 align:start position:0%
would be of Greater service to them
 
05:04:19.860 --> 05:04:22.190 align:start position:0%
would be of Greater service to them
so

05:04:22.190 --> 05:04:22.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:04:25.128 --> 05:04:25.138 align:start position:0%
um I'm suggesting
 
05:04:26.930 --> 05:04:26.940 align:start position:0%
um and they'll be Surplus after this
 
05:04:29.690 --> 05:04:29.700 align:start position:0%
also but I'm suggesting that we consider
 
05:04:32.868 --> 05:04:32.878 align:start position:0%
1.5 million dollars for critical
 
05:04:34.970 --> 05:04:34.980 align:start position:0%
maintenance of the community college
 
05:04:34.980 --> 05:04:37.010 align:start position:0%
maintenance of the community college
system

05:04:37.010 --> 05:04:37.020 align:start position:0%
system
 
05:04:37.020 --> 05:04:38.930 align:start position:0%
system
discussion

05:04:38.930 --> 05:04:38.940 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
05:04:42.230 --> 05:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
yes please Mike represent beggar uh
 
05:04:43.970 --> 05:04:43.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:04:43.980 --> 05:04:44.868 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

05:04:44.868 --> 05:04:44.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:47.810 --> 05:04:47.820 align:start position:0%
when I look at the needs
 
05:04:50.990 --> 05:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
the 1.5 to me is more important and one
 
05:04:52.810 --> 05:04:52.820 align:start position:0%
of the reasons I'll say it is they have
 
05:04:55.788 --> 05:04:55.798 align:start position:0%
Appropriations in now from past you know
 
05:04:58.010 --> 05:04:58.020 align:start position:0%
they're elapsing for critical
 
05:04:59.990 --> 05:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
maintenance and it's not done
 
05:05:02.090 --> 05:05:02.100 align:start position:0%
I if I was going to have to choose
 
05:05:03.650 --> 05:05:03.660 align:start position:0%
between the two I would go for the
 
05:05:06.110 --> 05:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
respiratory therapy because it's such a
 
05:05:07.850 --> 05:05:07.860 align:start position:0%
shortage of that and again it's
 
05:05:09.288 --> 05:05:09.298 align:start position:0%
Community College where people get
 
05:05:10.910 --> 05:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
trained and pretty much stay in the
 
05:05:14.330 --> 05:05:14.340 align:start position:0%
state thank you okay
 
05:05:16.850 --> 05:05:16.860 align:start position:0%
I think it's you and me on that uh go
 
05:05:24.250 --> 05:05:24.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:28.670 --> 05:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
my apologies so just so in this category
 
05:05:30.230 --> 05:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
of community ecology system so are you
 
05:05:30.240 --> 05:05:32.170 align:start position:0%
of community ecology system so are you
proposing

05:05:32.170 --> 05:05:32.180 align:start position:0%
proposing
 
05:05:36.650 --> 05:05:36.660 align:start position:0%
a 1.5 million dollars to has to be
 
05:05:39.110 --> 05:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
allocated for to cover these three
 
05:05:39.120 --> 05:05:40.550 align:start position:0%
allocated for to cover these three
subjects

05:05:40.550 --> 05:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
subjects
 
05:05:43.430 --> 05:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
no I'm I'm I'm suggesting after speaking
 
05:05:45.590 --> 05:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
to the um
 
05:05:48.170 --> 05:05:48.180 align:start position:0%
to the Community College I'm suggesting
 
05:05:52.310 --> 05:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
that we permit we allow additional 1.5
 
05:05:55.128 --> 05:05:55.138 align:start position:0%
million dollars for critical maintenance
 
05:05:55.138 --> 05:05:56.690 align:start position:0%
million dollars for critical maintenance
only

05:05:56.690 --> 05:05:56.700 align:start position:0%
only
 
05:06:00.288 --> 05:06:00.298 align:start position:0%
so changing so that line which is 3.425
 
05:06:04.670 --> 05:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
would go to 1.5 that line uh 12
 
05:06:04.680 --> 05:06:06.288 align:start position:0%
would go to 1.5 that line uh 12
correct

05:06:06.288 --> 05:06:06.298 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:06:08.990 --> 05:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
got it okay thank you
 
05:06:09.000 --> 05:06:11.150 align:start position:0%
got it okay thank you
representative

05:06:11.150 --> 05:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:06:14.030 --> 05:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
I just would concur with Mike that um
 
05:06:16.310 --> 05:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
the 1.5 in
 
05:06:16.320 --> 05:06:18.230 align:start position:0%
the 1.5 in
uh

05:06:18.230 --> 05:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:06:21.170 --> 05:06:21.180 align:start position:0%
the respiratory therapy gives a
 
05:06:24.350 --> 05:06:24.360 align:start position:0%
continual return on investment uh and
 
05:06:25.850 --> 05:06:25.860 align:start position:0%
puts people out in the field right now
 
05:06:28.490 --> 05:06:28.500 align:start position:0%
and there is a huge shortage by not
 
05:06:30.470 --> 05:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
doing it it also leaves us at a
 
05:06:31.550 --> 05:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
disadvantage with the state of
 
05:06:34.250 --> 05:06:34.260 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts where they can skip across
 
05:06:37.250 --> 05:06:37.260 align:start position:0%
the border and do the program and they
 
05:06:37.260 --> 05:06:38.448 align:start position:0%
the border and do the program and they
do

05:06:38.448 --> 05:06:38.458 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:06:40.910 --> 05:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
Surplus or lapse critical maintenance
 
05:06:44.150 --> 05:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
money now whether it's because the
 
05:06:45.708 --> 05:06:45.718 align:start position:0%
product project they're working on came
 
05:06:47.930 --> 05:06:47.940 align:start position:0%
in under or they just didn't feel like
 
05:06:49.128 --> 05:06:49.138 align:start position:0%
going through the Hoops to go through
 
05:06:51.110 --> 05:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal to use some of the excess money
 
05:06:53.690 --> 05:06:53.700 align:start position:0%
elsewhere I don't know but I would be
 
05:06:55.850 --> 05:06:55.860 align:start position:0%
more inclined to go the respiratory
 
05:06:58.310 --> 05:06:58.320 align:start position:0%
therapy okay thank you representative
 
05:07:00.110 --> 05:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
represent Faulkner
 
05:07:02.270 --> 05:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
I I agree with that you need to fund the
 
05:07:02.280 --> 05:07:04.310 align:start position:0%
I I agree with that you need to fund the
respiratory

05:07:04.310 --> 05:07:04.320 align:start position:0%
respiratory
 
05:07:07.250 --> 05:07:07.260 align:start position:0%
a therapy program but it's
 
05:07:10.430 --> 05:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
what reason can we do both we give them
 
05:07:12.350 --> 05:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
the 1.5 million they need or think they
 
05:07:14.030 --> 05:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
need for critical maintenance as well as
 
05:07:15.770 --> 05:07:15.780 align:start position:0%
this program I would say I would be in
 
05:07:17.990 --> 05:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
favor of doing both because it
 
05:07:20.448 --> 05:07:20.458 align:start position:0%
this is absolutely the agency that has
 
05:07:22.010 --> 05:07:22.020 align:start position:0%
the biggest bang for the buck of all the
 
05:07:23.868 --> 05:07:23.878 align:start position:0%
things that we that we helped fund I
 
05:07:25.610 --> 05:07:25.620 align:start position:0%
think is so important to the state and
 
05:07:28.610 --> 05:07:28.620 align:start position:0%
I'm be happy to help them however we
 
05:07:29.628 --> 05:07:29.638 align:start position:0%
need to
 
05:07:33.050 --> 05:07:33.060 align:start position:0%
thank you further comment question yes
 
05:07:41.810 --> 05:07:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:44.090 --> 05:07:44.100 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative Faulkner raises
 
05:07:46.670 --> 05:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
an interesting question so how much
 
05:07:49.788 --> 05:07:49.798 align:start position:0%
money did get lapsed from the community
 
05:07:54.010 --> 05:07:54.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:56.750 --> 05:07:56.760 align:start position:0%
and I think we need I think
 
05:07:59.448 --> 05:07:59.458 align:start position:0%
representative Jack grenita
 
05:08:07.970 --> 05:08:07.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:10.850 --> 05:08:10.860 align:start position:0%
just for clarification the community
 
05:08:13.010 --> 05:08:13.020 align:start position:0%
college is asking to have Labs
 
05:08:15.410 --> 05:08:15.420 align:start position:0%
extensions on
 
05:08:18.230 --> 05:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
um one of their critical maintenance and
 
05:08:19.850 --> 05:08:19.860 align:start position:0%
um well two that one that's in the
 
05:08:21.170 --> 05:08:21.180 align:start position:0%
budget and they're asking for a second
 
05:08:24.350 --> 05:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
one that was not contained
 
05:08:25.970 --> 05:08:25.980 align:start position:0%
um just to be clear
 
05:08:28.610 --> 05:08:28.620 align:start position:0%
yep yep
 
05:08:31.368 --> 05:08:31.378 align:start position:0%
so that would that would help them do
 
05:08:33.590 --> 05:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
critical maintenance if they got those
 
05:08:33.600 --> 05:08:34.990 align:start position:0%
critical maintenance if they got those
yes

05:08:34.990 --> 05:08:35.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:08:38.628 --> 05:08:38.638 align:start position:0%
they would finish up so when I talked to
 
05:08:40.190 --> 05:08:40.200 align:start position:0%
Community College about lapse extension
 
05:08:40.200 --> 05:08:41.570 align:start position:0%
Community College about lapse extension
stuff

05:08:41.570 --> 05:08:41.580 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
05:08:43.610 --> 05:08:43.620 align:start position:0%
um they've spent most of the money in
 
05:08:45.530 --> 05:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
all their critical maintenance they just
 
05:08:46.610 --> 05:08:46.620 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that the project
 
05:08:48.470 --> 05:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
didn't close before they finished paying
 
05:08:49.730 --> 05:08:49.740 align:start position:0%
all the bills
 
05:08:52.010 --> 05:08:52.020 align:start position:0%
so they've encumbered the bill they may
 
05:08:54.288 --> 05:08:54.298 align:start position:0%
not have closed it out yet all right
 
05:08:55.610 --> 05:08:55.620 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for that
 
05:08:57.890 --> 05:08:57.900 align:start position:0%
clarification represent Mills
 
05:08:59.930 --> 05:08:59.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair just want the
 
05:09:02.208 --> 05:09:02.218 align:start position:0%
committee to know that originally
 
05:09:04.090 --> 05:09:04.100 align:start position:0%
chairman McConkey
 
05:09:07.190 --> 05:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
I think we've all just about said the
 
05:09:09.110 --> 05:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
same thing we'd like to support the
 
05:09:12.590 --> 05:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
respiratory therapy program and he kind
 
05:09:14.868 --> 05:09:14.878 align:start position:0%
of nudged nudged them and let them know
 
05:09:17.708 --> 05:09:17.718 align:start position:0%
that we would be very very
 
05:09:20.868 --> 05:09:20.878 align:start position:0%
amenable to to giving them a million
 
05:09:23.868 --> 05:09:23.878 align:start position:0%
five for the respiratory committee they
 
05:09:26.448 --> 05:09:26.458 align:start position:0%
came back to us and said thank you very
 
05:09:29.990 --> 05:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
much but we would rather take that money
 
05:09:32.330 --> 05:09:32.340 align:start position:0%
if you do have it available and use it
 
05:09:34.788 --> 05:09:34.798 align:start position:0%
for critical maintenance so this was
 
05:09:37.190 --> 05:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
actually their choice to do it this way
 
05:09:40.208 --> 05:09:40.218 align:start position:0%
we can of course overrule them and say
 
05:09:43.070 --> 05:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
Here's the million five it's it's got to
 
05:09:44.830 --> 05:09:44.840 align:start position:0%
be used for respiratory
 
05:09:47.930 --> 05:09:47.940 align:start position:0%
therapy but their request was actually
 
05:09:50.090 --> 05:09:50.100 align:start position:0%
to take that money and put it towards
 
05:09:52.550 --> 05:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
critical maintenance
 
05:09:54.650 --> 05:09:54.660 align:start position:0%
further discussion yes representative
 
05:09:59.810 --> 05:09:59.820 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman this two quick points
 
05:10:01.670 --> 05:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
did I recall when the president of the
 
05:10:03.590 --> 05:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
community college system was had during
 
05:10:05.208 --> 05:10:05.218 align:start position:0%
testimony that
 
05:10:08.810 --> 05:10:08.820 align:start position:0%
did they not have a a budget together or
 
05:10:10.550 --> 05:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
a plan together for Capital Improvements
 
05:10:12.530 --> 05:10:12.540 align:start position:0%
because they were working on it if I
 
05:10:15.110 --> 05:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
recall if they do oh
 
05:10:16.910 --> 05:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
okay I
 
05:10:18.890 --> 05:10:18.900 align:start position:0%
recall a testimony saying he and they
 
05:10:18.900 --> 05:10:19.670 align:start position:0%
recall a testimony saying he and they
didn't

05:10:19.670 --> 05:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
05:10:21.410 --> 05:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
the governor's office didn't fund
 
05:10:24.050 --> 05:10:24.060 align:start position:0%
correct okay all right so these are
 
05:10:27.050 --> 05:10:27.060 align:start position:0%
their requests um so presently there is
 
05:10:27.060 --> 05:10:29.208 align:start position:0%
their requests um so presently there is
a

05:10:29.208 --> 05:10:29.218 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:10:31.788 --> 05:10:31.798 align:start position:0%
the Therapy Program is up and running
 
05:10:34.490 --> 05:10:34.500 align:start position:0%
they just want to improve it and extend
 
05:10:38.270 --> 05:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
it or and uh and and propagate it if you
 
05:10:38.280 --> 05:10:39.110 align:start position:0%
it or and uh and and propagate it if you
will

05:10:39.110 --> 05:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
will
 
05:10:39.120 --> 05:10:40.430 align:start position:0%
will
um

05:10:40.430 --> 05:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:42.530 --> 05:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
no I I believe this is a new program
 
05:10:44.270 --> 05:10:44.280 align:start position:0%
this is a brand new program that's
 
05:10:47.330 --> 05:10:47.340 align:start position:0%
trying to initiate okay I just
 
05:10:50.270 --> 05:10:50.280 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at teaching space renovation
 
05:10:53.868 --> 05:10:53.878 align:start position:0%
okay so this is a brand new program
 
05:10:53.878 --> 05:10:56.868 align:start position:0%
okay so this is a brand new program
um

05:10:56.868 --> 05:10:56.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:58.970 --> 05:10:58.980 align:start position:0%
and it sounds like they have additional
 
05:11:00.708 --> 05:11:00.718 align:start position:0%
critical maintenance needs that they're
 
05:11:02.390 --> 05:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
they've had on the back burner that's
 
05:11:06.288 --> 05:11:06.298 align:start position:0%
what they they have a large need for
 
05:11:08.448 --> 05:11:08.458 align:start position:0%
critical maintenance okay the governor
 
05:11:10.970 --> 05:11:10.980 align:start position:0%
didn't fund it thank you
 
05:11:13.250 --> 05:11:13.260 align:start position:0%
yes representative Jack uh thank you it
 
05:11:15.410 --> 05:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
seems like there's a strong sense in the
 
05:11:17.810 --> 05:11:17.820 align:start position:0%
committee that they would like to fund
 
05:11:20.330 --> 05:11:20.340 align:start position:0%
the respiratory therapy it looks to me
 
05:11:22.430 --> 05:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
with what we have remaining that we
 
05:11:25.030 --> 05:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
could consider that we might be able to
 
05:11:27.890 --> 05:11:27.900 align:start position:0%
uh squeeze some money into critical
 
05:11:30.050 --> 05:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
maintenance and fund
 
05:11:32.810 --> 05:11:32.820 align:start position:0%
whatever else we want to fund and still
 
05:11:34.730 --> 05:11:34.740 align:start position:0%
fit within what we have available so we
 
05:11:36.470 --> 05:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
might be able to do both
 
05:11:40.310 --> 05:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
uh at us at a lower level
 
05:11:43.670 --> 05:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative below
 
05:11:46.490 --> 05:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
just to try to build on on what was just
 
05:11:49.730 --> 05:11:49.740 align:start position:0%
said so if looking we had 14 million
 
05:11:51.650 --> 05:11:51.660 align:start position:0%
just I'm just running it looks like we
 
05:11:53.570 --> 05:11:53.580 align:start position:0%
have still about six and a half million
 
05:11:55.490 --> 05:11:55.500 align:start position:0%
dollars that we haven't talked about
 
05:11:57.948 --> 05:11:57.958 align:start position:0%
because taking care of that CTE setting
 
05:11:59.090 --> 05:11:59.100 align:start position:0%
that aside
 
05:12:00.770 --> 05:12:00.780 align:start position:0%
looking at it starting with the 14
 
05:12:03.410 --> 05:12:03.420 align:start position:0%
million that was was left over taking
 
05:12:04.910 --> 05:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
that out we're at about six and a half
 
05:12:07.190 --> 05:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
million that we haven't done anything
 
05:12:09.590 --> 05:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
about we're talking about this and
 
05:12:12.230 --> 05:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
talking about the the two I mean I hate
 
05:12:15.410 --> 05:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
to leave maintenance is just isn't sexy
 
05:12:17.390 --> 05:12:17.400 align:start position:0%
right I mean it isn't but if you don't
 
05:12:20.030 --> 05:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
do it man think about those pictures of
 
05:12:22.970 --> 05:12:22.980 align:start position:0%
the prison what happens when you don't
 
05:12:25.010 --> 05:12:25.020 align:start position:0%
take care of Maintenance it really is
 
05:12:25.020 --> 05:12:27.050 align:start position:0%
take care of Maintenance it really is
bad

05:12:27.050 --> 05:12:27.060 align:start position:0%
bad
 
05:12:28.730 --> 05:12:28.740 align:start position:0%
you also I think you were talking about
 
05:12:30.890 --> 05:12:30.900 align:start position:0%
just maybe lower system
 
05:12:33.350 --> 05:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
lower the amounts uh on both those lines
 
05:12:35.448 --> 05:12:35.458 align:start position:0%
and at least try to address those two
 
05:12:38.448 --> 05:12:38.458 align:start position:0%
areas both maintenance and
 
05:12:40.310 --> 05:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
um the respiratory program
 
05:12:43.250 --> 05:12:43.260 align:start position:0%
so that is an option we have I'm I'm I
 
05:12:45.050 --> 05:12:45.060 align:start position:0%
would like to suggest
 
05:12:48.650 --> 05:12:48.660 align:start position:0%
that we at least look at a
 
05:12:50.868 --> 05:12:50.878 align:start position:0%
look at putting in the one and a half
 
05:12:52.930 --> 05:12:52.940 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
05:12:56.230 --> 05:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
as as a figure to start the conversation
 
05:12:59.448 --> 05:12:59.458 align:start position:0%
let's go through let's go through more
 
05:13:02.208 --> 05:13:02.218 align:start position:0%
of this and if we can bring more money
 
05:13:04.070 --> 05:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
back here and we decide that's what we
 
05:13:06.770 --> 05:13:06.780 align:start position:0%
want to do and I like that idea then
 
05:13:09.830 --> 05:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
we'll come back with more funds as we
 
05:13:12.590 --> 05:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
find them but I'd like to suggest that
 
05:13:17.090 --> 05:13:17.100 align:start position:0%
we we target 1.5 million dollars at this
 
05:13:19.670 --> 05:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
point and then we can thrash out if we
 
05:13:21.730 --> 05:13:21.740 align:start position:0%
can have more money or not
 
05:13:25.010 --> 05:13:25.020 align:start position:0%
and if we if we don't then what it is
 
05:13:27.288 --> 05:13:27.298 align:start position:0%
we're going to say that we would like
 
05:13:29.090 --> 05:13:29.100 align:start position:0%
them to move forward with representative
 
05:13:32.270 --> 05:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
yeah I agree Mr chairman uh I think I've
 
05:13:34.550 --> 05:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
been listening to debate I am torn I
 
05:13:36.350 --> 05:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
think we should go through everything
 
05:13:38.990 --> 05:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
and then maybe come back later to the
 
05:13:41.090 --> 05:13:41.100 align:start position:0%
item and maybe decide maybe to add more
 
05:13:43.190 --> 05:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
money and maybe do both I I see both
 
05:13:45.530 --> 05:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
points but I eventually I think we've
 
05:13:47.810 --> 05:13:47.820 align:start position:0%
got to make a decision but we have I
 
05:13:49.250 --> 05:13:49.260 align:start position:0%
think a little bit of room to play with
 
05:13:50.990 --> 05:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
as far as the available funds thank you
 
05:13:53.090 --> 05:13:53.100 align:start position:0%
okay represent milts and then I'll come
 
05:13:55.970 --> 05:13:55.980 align:start position:0%
back to you representative Newton I just
 
05:13:58.310 --> 05:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
thought I just wanted to make a motion
 
05:14:00.948 --> 05:14:00.958 align:start position:0%
for a straw poll to at least put forth
 
05:14:03.350 --> 05:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
the figure of 1.5 million dollars for
 
05:14:05.510 --> 05:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
Community College at this point and if
 
05:14:07.788 --> 05:14:07.798 align:start position:0%
we're agreed on that then we can because
 
05:14:09.530 --> 05:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
we've got a list of other things we want
 
05:14:11.208 --> 05:14:11.218 align:start position:0%
to go through that gives us a dollar
 
05:14:11.218 --> 05:14:13.010 align:start position:0%
to go through that gives us a dollar
figure

05:14:13.010 --> 05:14:13.020 align:start position:0%
figure
 
05:14:15.410 --> 05:14:15.420 align:start position:0%
to work with no matter where we put it
 
05:14:16.970 --> 05:14:16.980 align:start position:0%
now we can always come back and add to
 
05:14:19.070 --> 05:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
it but at least start at 1.5 million
 
05:14:20.930 --> 05:14:20.940 align:start position:0%
thank you well I want to acknowledge
 
05:14:25.628 --> 05:14:25.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:27.590 --> 05:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
I'll come back to you representative
 
05:14:29.810 --> 05:14:29.820 align:start position:0%
Newton has hand up to yes thank you Mr
 
05:14:33.530 --> 05:14:33.540 align:start position:0%
chairman I'd like to see the totals of
 
05:14:35.690 --> 05:14:35.700 align:start position:0%
the agency request
 
05:14:38.990 --> 05:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
and we see what we've got for requests
 
05:14:41.448 --> 05:14:41.458 align:start position:0%
for money and how much we've got to
 
05:14:41.458 --> 05:14:43.670 align:start position:0%
for money and how much we've got to
spend

05:14:43.670 --> 05:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
spend
 
05:14:45.650 --> 05:14:45.660 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to see us at some point
 
05:14:48.890 --> 05:14:48.900 align:start position:0%
look at trying to separate the wants
 
05:14:50.570 --> 05:14:50.580 align:start position:0%
from the needs
 
05:14:52.670 --> 05:14:52.680 align:start position:0%
and I think you've made a pretty good
 
05:14:54.830 --> 05:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
argument with your winner Squam and your
 
05:14:57.708 --> 05:14:57.718 align:start position:0%
critical critical maintenance as pretty
 
05:15:00.050 --> 05:15:00.060 align:start position:0%
much being what we're looking at as
 
05:15:00.060 --> 05:15:01.250 align:start position:0%
much being what we're looking at as
needs

05:15:01.250 --> 05:15:01.260 align:start position:0%
needs
 
05:15:04.970 --> 05:15:04.980 align:start position:0%
but I'd like to see the total amount
 
05:15:06.890 --> 05:15:06.900 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at and what we've got
 
05:15:08.690 --> 05:15:08.700 align:start position:0%
to actually
 
05:15:11.810 --> 05:15:11.820 align:start position:0%
spend and that might get us in a little
 
05:15:13.670 --> 05:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
more of a reality of where we're going
 
05:15:15.530 --> 05:15:15.540 align:start position:0%
with this because right now it looks
 
05:15:17.628 --> 05:15:17.638 align:start position:0%
like it's a lot more than the 14 million
 
05:15:19.850 --> 05:15:19.860 align:start position:0%
that we've got to spend that has been
 
05:15:23.390 --> 05:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
requested it certainly is
 
05:15:26.390 --> 05:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
um and we are going to get there my hope
 
05:15:29.150 --> 05:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
is to go go through the items we have
 
05:15:32.330 --> 05:15:32.340 align:start position:0%
here see where that number is
 
05:15:35.390 --> 05:15:35.400 align:start position:0%
um and um and then we will work to
 
05:15:39.590 --> 05:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
either move up uh move items down or uh
 
05:15:41.990 --> 05:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
maybe we request more money so thank you
 
05:15:44.868 --> 05:15:44.878 align:start position:0%
we're going to get you there
 
05:15:47.868 --> 05:15:47.878 align:start position:0%
um represent yours
 
05:15:51.230 --> 05:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
disregard thank you thank you
 
05:15:53.868 --> 05:15:53.878 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
05:15:56.470 --> 05:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
um we will go to
 
05:15:59.750 --> 05:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
yeah straw polls straw poll at least 1.5
 
05:16:02.690 --> 05:16:02.700 align:start position:0%
million dollars appropriated
 
05:16:05.628 --> 05:16:05.638 align:start position:0%
we seem to be unanimous thank you for
 
05:16:05.638 --> 05:16:08.990 align:start position:0%
we seem to be unanimous thank you for
that

05:16:08.990 --> 05:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:11.570 --> 05:16:11.580 align:start position:0%
um line for Department of Human Health
 
05:16:13.310 --> 05:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
and Human Services
 
05:16:22.250 --> 05:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:25.128 --> 05:16:25.138 align:start position:0%
22 on the agency request glencliffe
 
05:16:28.510 --> 05:16:28.520 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment improvements
 
05:16:31.970 --> 05:16:31.980 align:start position:0%
we this facility
 
05:16:31.980 --> 05:16:33.410 align:start position:0%
we this facility
um

05:16:33.410 --> 05:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:36.230 --> 05:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
is not close here to Concord
 
05:16:38.390 --> 05:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
um they do wonderful wonderful work
 
05:16:38.400 --> 05:16:40.250 align:start position:0%
um they do wonderful wonderful work
there

05:16:40.250 --> 05:16:40.260 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:16:42.770 --> 05:16:42.780 align:start position:0%
um this wastewater treatment
 
05:16:42.780 --> 05:16:45.288 align:start position:0%
um this wastewater treatment
improvements

05:16:45.288 --> 05:16:45.298 align:start position:0%
improvements
 
05:16:47.930 --> 05:16:47.940 align:start position:0%
has been a critical need for them for
 
05:16:51.730 --> 05:16:51.740 align:start position:0%
years and it continues to be ignored
 
05:16:57.010 --> 05:16:57.020 align:start position:0%
you talk wish and you know what we need
 
05:16:59.590 --> 05:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
they the agency
 
05:17:03.470 --> 05:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
has repurposed some monies in part of
 
05:17:05.390 --> 05:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
this proposal Chris
 
05:17:08.090 --> 05:17:08.100 align:start position:0%
so the agency in an effort to try to
 
05:17:08.100 --> 05:17:09.110 align:start position:0%
so the agency in an effort to try to
fund

05:17:09.110 --> 05:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
fund
 
05:17:12.230 --> 05:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
this project tried to lapse um
 
05:17:14.750 --> 05:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
projects they didn't get to the 1.4
 
05:17:15.948 --> 05:17:15.958 align:start position:0%
million but they did get a couple
 
05:17:17.208 --> 05:17:17.218 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars of General
 
05:17:20.208 --> 05:17:20.218 align:start position:0%
funds that's in that 3.8 million dollars
 
05:17:22.190 --> 05:17:22.200 align:start position:0%
of repurposed funds that you are
 
05:17:24.530 --> 05:17:24.540 align:start position:0%
discussing thank you
 
05:17:29.690 --> 05:17:29.700 align:start position:0%
so I I see this as as a need and I'm
 
05:17:31.910 --> 05:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
suggesting that we put one point one
 
05:17:33.770 --> 05:17:33.780 align:start position:0%
million four hundred and thirty two
 
05:17:36.590 --> 05:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to this is their
 
05:17:39.850 --> 05:17:39.860 align:start position:0%
discussion yes representative Abbott
 
05:17:44.570 --> 05:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
yes I think when we say it's a need I
 
05:17:46.788 --> 05:17:46.798 align:start position:0%
mean the alternative
 
05:17:50.030 --> 05:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
um to not doing this is closing the
 
05:17:51.530 --> 05:17:51.540 align:start position:0%
place down
 
05:17:53.930 --> 05:17:53.940 align:start position:0%
and I think what you know where it's
 
05:17:56.810 --> 05:17:56.820 align:start position:0%
located in rumney and it serves the
 
05:17:59.628 --> 05:17:59.638 align:start position:0%
folks in the North country and I don't
 
05:18:02.690 --> 05:18:02.700 align:start position:0%
know what the alternative would be to
 
05:18:06.890 --> 05:18:06.900 align:start position:0%
this facility and that's why I agree
 
05:18:08.868 --> 05:18:08.878 align:start position:0%
with you Mr chairman
 
05:18:09.948 --> 05:18:09.958 align:start position:0%
um that
 
05:18:09.958 --> 05:18:10.670 align:start position:0%
um that
um

05:18:10.670 --> 05:18:10.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:16.250 --> 05:18:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:18.530 --> 05:18:18.540 align:start position:0%
thank you representative well said
 
05:18:20.868 --> 05:18:20.878 align:start position:0%
representative alone please right and
 
05:18:22.970 --> 05:18:22.980 align:start position:0%
just to add that so it could be
 
05:18:25.550 --> 05:18:25.560 align:start position:0%
Pennywise pound foolish if we don't do
 
05:18:28.610 --> 05:18:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:31.190 --> 05:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
representative Mills thank you Mr chair
 
05:18:33.170 --> 05:18:33.180 align:start position:0%
once again even though it's it sounds
 
05:18:36.650 --> 05:18:36.660 align:start position:0%
like a large amount 1.4 million
 
05:18:38.570 --> 05:18:38.580 align:start position:0%
their understanding was they gave up
 
05:18:40.788 --> 05:18:40.798 align:start position:0%
they lapsed a lot of money back towards
 
05:18:43.368 --> 05:18:43.378 align:start position:0%
us I think it was in excess of
 
05:18:45.530 --> 05:18:45.540 align:start position:0%
seven eight hundred thousand dollars
 
05:18:47.930 --> 05:18:47.940 align:start position:0%
that they gave up in lapses that we've
 
05:18:50.930 --> 05:18:50.940 align:start position:0%
got in our 3.8 million aforementioned
 
05:18:53.570 --> 05:18:53.580 align:start position:0%
lapse money so we'd actually only be
 
05:18:56.770 --> 05:18:56.780 align:start position:0%
giving out of this four 1.4 million
 
05:19:00.050 --> 05:19:00.060 align:start position:0%
they've already contributed 800 000 of
 
05:19:00.060 --> 05:19:00.708 align:start position:0%
they've already contributed 800 000 of
it

05:19:00.708 --> 05:19:00.718 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:19:02.530 --> 05:19:02.540 align:start position:0%
does that make any sense
 
05:19:05.990 --> 05:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:08.750 --> 05:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
any further discussion

okay so um whatever our count is minus

05:19:32.750 --> 05:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:36.970 --> 05:19:36.980 align:start position:0%
another department that we have always
 
05:19:41.170 --> 05:19:41.180 align:start position:0%
tried to find more money when we can
 
05:19:43.730 --> 05:19:43.740 align:start position:0%
the state park system under the
 
05:19:45.350 --> 05:19:45.360 align:start position:0%

05:19:50.030 --> 05:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
people not only come to our state for
 
05:19:52.868 --> 05:19:52.878 align:start position:0%
our state park system
 
05:19:56.150 --> 05:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
our own residents find this a Haven of
 
05:19:58.788 --> 05:19:58.798 align:start position:0%
where to go and if you live in a less
 
05:20:00.890 --> 05:20:00.900 align:start position:0%
fortunate place to be able to come to
 
05:20:03.830 --> 05:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
this beauty is just beyond reach for
 
05:20:06.650 --> 05:20:06.660 align:start position:0%
most people so we have always been able
 
05:20:10.788 --> 05:20:10.798 align:start position:0%
to find in my starting my ninth term we
 
05:20:13.610 --> 05:20:13.620 align:start position:0%
have always looked to find money here
 
05:20:15.890 --> 05:20:15.900 align:start position:0%
and they were fortunate to get some arpa
 
05:20:18.948 --> 05:20:18.958 align:start position:0%
funds uh if you remember when the
 
05:20:21.230 --> 05:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner was here
 
05:20:24.288 --> 05:20:24.298 align:start position:0%
um there were a project brought forward
 
05:20:26.690 --> 05:20:26.700 align:start position:0%
the Connecticut Lakes Headwaters Road
 
05:20:29.750 --> 05:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
repairs and she had a second item which
 
05:20:34.190 --> 05:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
was Paving of the State Park parking
 
05:20:37.390 --> 05:20:37.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:41.390 --> 05:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
items 35 and 36.
 
05:20:43.910 --> 05:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
the Connecticut River Headwaters had
 
05:20:46.850 --> 05:20:46.860 align:start position:0%
asked for Road repairs that asked for a
 
05:20:48.910 --> 05:20:48.920 align:start position:0%
million 2.5
 
05:20:53.090 --> 05:20:53.100 align:start position:0%
one one and a half million dollars and
 
05:20:56.990 --> 05:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
the commissioner had asked 250 000 for
 
05:20:58.368 --> 05:20:58.378 align:start position:0%
parking lots
 
05:21:01.010 --> 05:21:01.020 align:start position:0%
parking lots are a liability parking
 
05:21:03.470 --> 05:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
lots uh we have to we have we we need to
 
05:21:05.750 --> 05:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
take care of those because it's like our
 
05:21:07.730 --> 05:21:07.740 align:start position:0%
highways if we don't do something to our
 
05:21:10.490 --> 05:21:10.500 align:start position:0%
Highway within nine years we lose it we
 
05:21:12.650 --> 05:21:12.660 align:start position:0%
start again a parking lot I'm sure has
 
05:21:17.390 --> 05:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
as quick or quicker uh depreciation I'm
 
05:21:19.970 --> 05:21:19.980 align:start position:0%
suggesting that we put 250
 
05:21:22.788 --> 05:21:22.798 align:start position:0%
000 into the parking lots as they had
 
05:21:22.798 --> 05:21:24.350 align:start position:0%
000 into the parking lots as they had
requested

05:21:24.350 --> 05:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
requested
 
05:21:28.090 --> 05:21:28.100 align:start position:0%
and I'm asking instead of 1.5 million
 
05:21:31.070 --> 05:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
that we put five hundred thousand
 
05:21:32.930 --> 05:21:32.940 align:start position:0%
dollars into the Connecticut Lakes
 
05:21:32.940 --> 05:21:34.150 align:start position:0%
dollars into the Connecticut Lakes
Headwater

05:21:34.150 --> 05:21:34.160 align:start position:0%
Headwater
 
05:21:36.610 --> 05:21:36.620 align:start position:0%
Road repairs
 
05:21:41.330 --> 05:21:41.340 align:start position:0%
it's it's a million plus was how many
 
05:21:43.850 --> 05:21:43.860 align:start position:0%
acres was it it's a huge it's a huge
 
05:21:43.860 --> 05:21:45.050 align:start position:0%
acres was it it's a huge it's a huge
property

05:21:45.050 --> 05:21:45.060 align:start position:0%
property
 
05:21:46.850 --> 05:21:46.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:21:46.860 --> 05:21:49.730 align:start position:0%
thank you
yeah

05:21:49.730 --> 05:21:49.740 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:21:53.470 --> 05:21:53.480 align:start position:0%
and uh the the the
 
05:21:55.970 --> 05:21:55.980 align:start position:0%
appropriation of that had started in
 
05:21:58.850 --> 05:21:58.860 align:start position:0%
public works that uh uh representative
 
05:22:01.910 --> 05:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
Chandler speaker Chandler had um
 
05:22:05.270 --> 05:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
had made mention and when they had done
 
05:22:08.570 --> 05:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
that they had set up some funds inside
 
05:22:10.550 --> 05:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
of that that they were hoping to take
 
05:22:14.090 --> 05:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
care of these needs but they've they've
 
05:22:17.150 --> 05:22:17.160 align:start position:0%
fallen way short I would like to provide
 
05:22:20.510 --> 05:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
more money but I I think us giving a
 
05:22:22.850 --> 05:22:22.860 align:start position:0%
half a million dollars to this
 
05:22:25.788 --> 05:22:25.798 align:start position:0%
certainly will let them prioritize what
 
05:22:29.750 --> 05:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
needed what needs to be done now and
 
05:22:31.430 --> 05:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
they can come back in Future
 
05:22:34.490 --> 05:22:34.500 align:start position:0%
Appropriations so I'm asking that we
 
05:22:37.128 --> 05:22:37.138 align:start position:0%
increase the appropriation to the
 
05:22:38.750 --> 05:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Natural and cultural
 
05:22:38.760 --> 05:22:40.690 align:start position:0%
Department of Natural and cultural
resources

05:22:40.690 --> 05:22:40.700 align:start position:0%
resources
 
05:22:44.510 --> 05:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
by 750
 
05:22:46.070 --> 05:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
000 dollars
 
05:22:46.080 --> 05:22:49.070 align:start position:0%
000 dollars
discussion

05:22:49.070 --> 05:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:51.350 --> 05:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
yes represent me
 
05:22:53.570 --> 05:22:53.580 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I agree with you 100 on doing
 
05:22:58.550 --> 05:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
the money and I just want to add in I
 
05:22:59.930 --> 05:22:59.940 align:start position:0%
think you were here at the same time
 
05:23:03.350 --> 05:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
that I was when we leveraged this
 
05:23:06.288 --> 05:23:06.298 align:start position:0%
property and part of the agreement was
 
05:23:08.330 --> 05:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
that we would maintain those roads so
 
05:23:11.390 --> 05:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
this is keeping the word faith and trust
 
05:23:13.368 --> 05:23:13.378 align:start position:0%
of the State of New Hampshire in doing
 
05:23:13.378 --> 05:23:14.208 align:start position:0%
of the State of New Hampshire in doing
so

05:23:14.208 --> 05:23:14.218 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:23:15.948 --> 05:23:15.958 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
05:23:19.788 --> 05:23:19.798 align:start position:0%
representative to the the State Park
 
05:23:23.330 --> 05:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
parking lots uh over at Pawtuckaway
 
05:23:25.490 --> 05:23:25.500 align:start position:0%
there's there could be some some help
 
05:23:27.050 --> 05:23:27.060 align:start position:0%
needed there and certainly the access
 
05:23:29.330 --> 05:23:29.340 align:start position:0%
road leading up to the beach parking lot
 
05:23:31.670 --> 05:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
of Pawtuckaway State Park to use you
 
05:23:32.868 --> 05:23:32.878 align:start position:0%
know some washing out there's some
 
05:23:37.030 --> 05:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
potholes uh I I can understand the need
 
05:23:39.948 --> 05:23:39.958 align:start position:0%
to the entire park uh Park system
 
05:23:42.770 --> 05:23:42.780 align:start position:0%
parking lots for sure thank you thank
 
05:23:42.780 --> 05:23:43.610 align:start position:0%
parking lots for sure thank you thank
you

05:23:43.610 --> 05:23:43.620 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:23:45.410 --> 05:23:45.420 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative Jack
 
05:23:48.050 --> 05:23:48.060 align:start position:0%
yeah on the plus side over the last few
 
05:23:50.150 --> 05:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
bienniums since I've been here we've
 
05:23:51.650 --> 05:23:51.660 align:start position:0%
tried to give them everything they
 
05:23:54.288 --> 05:23:54.298 align:start position:0%
wanted plus a little and we've over
 
05:23:56.990 --> 05:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
thought over that time we've we've
 
05:23:58.670 --> 05:23:58.680 align:start position:0%
really knocked down the amount of things
 
05:24:00.530 --> 05:24:00.540 align:start position:0%
that they have to do if this is the only
 
05:24:03.890 --> 05:24:03.900 align:start position:0%
thing that they're asking for it means
 
05:24:05.628 --> 05:24:05.638 align:start position:0%
that everything else we've gotten in
 
05:24:07.310 --> 05:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
pretty good shape so I'm strongly
 
05:24:07.320 --> 05:24:08.330 align:start position:0%
pretty good shape so I'm strongly
supporting

05:24:08.330 --> 05:24:08.340 align:start position:0%
supporting
 
05:24:11.810 --> 05:24:11.820 align:start position:0%
let's change thank you
 
05:24:13.788 --> 05:24:13.798 align:start position:0%
yes representative yeah what other
 
05:24:15.530 --> 05:24:15.540 align:start position:0%
funding sources do they have and what's
 
05:24:19.070 --> 05:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:21.650 --> 05:24:21.660 align:start position:0%
can you answer that so they have the
 
05:24:24.530 --> 05:24:24.540 align:start position:0%
park fund they have the trail funds
 
05:24:26.570 --> 05:24:26.580 align:start position:0%
um they have some arpa funding that was
 
05:24:29.628 --> 05:24:29.638 align:start position:0%
uh provided to them
 
05:24:31.610 --> 05:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
um so they're essentially a self-funded
 
05:24:31.620 --> 05:24:33.708 align:start position:0%
um so they're essentially a self-funded
agency

05:24:33.708 --> 05:24:33.718 align:start position:0%
agency
 
05:24:35.510 --> 05:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
but I don't have the total number of
 
05:24:37.010 --> 05:24:37.020 align:start position:0%
what their operating budget is off the
 
05:24:38.750 --> 05:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
top of my head I'd have to get that for
 
05:24:43.010 --> 05:24:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:47.448 --> 05:24:47.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:49.910 --> 05:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
if you're uh straw poll if you're in
 
05:24:52.610 --> 05:24:52.620 align:start position:0%
favor of 750 000 between these two
 
05:24:52.620 --> 05:24:55.128 align:start position:0%
favor of 750 000 between these two
projects

05:24:55.128 --> 05:24:55.138 align:start position:0%
projects
 
05:24:57.770 --> 05:24:57.780 align:start position:0%
we have
 
05:25:00.830 --> 05:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
those opposed
 
05:25:05.270 --> 05:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
okay all but one thank you
 
05:25:08.208 --> 05:25:08.218 align:start position:0%
next item I'd like to go to
 
05:25:10.208 --> 05:25:10.218 align:start position:0%
um we had a house bill
 
05:25:13.570 --> 05:25:13.580 align:start position:0%
house bill 199.
 
05:25:16.310 --> 05:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
which was uh Department of
 
05:25:19.670 --> 05:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
Transportation which was
 
05:25:19.680 --> 05:25:20.570 align:start position:0%
Transportation which was
um

05:25:20.570 --> 05:25:20.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:25:22.970 --> 05:25:22.980 align:start position:0%

05:25:28.250 --> 05:25:28.260 align:start position:0%
County Freight rail improvements the
 
05:25:31.250 --> 05:25:31.260 align:start position:0%
request was for a million dollars
 
05:25:33.670 --> 05:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
we have over
 
05:25:37.850 --> 05:25:37.860 align:start position:0%
at least two bienniums before this uh
 
05:25:41.270 --> 05:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
this being the third have made this
 
05:25:44.288 --> 05:25:44.298 align:start position:0%
appropriation uh and it's it's it's
 
05:25:49.250 --> 05:25:49.260 align:start position:0%
dependent on them getting matching funds
 
05:25:52.430 --> 05:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
um for their rail projects and this is
 
05:25:55.970 --> 05:25:55.980 align:start position:0%
this is for rail this is for Freight for
 
05:25:58.448 --> 05:25:58.458 align:start position:0%
Rail and the ties and the bed underneath
 
05:26:02.448 --> 05:26:02.458 align:start position:0%
the money's also been used for culverts
 
05:26:04.570 --> 05:26:04.580 align:start position:0%
and bridges and so forth
 
05:26:07.788 --> 05:26:07.798 align:start position:0%
I've had further conversations on this
 
05:26:10.850 --> 05:26:10.860 align:start position:0%
project and the Carol and Stratford
 
05:26:13.150 --> 05:26:13.160 align:start position:0%
Freight rail improvements
 
05:26:16.490 --> 05:26:16.500 align:start position:0%
can be downgraded from a half a million
 
05:26:18.350 --> 05:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
dollars to two hundred and fifty
 
05:26:20.150 --> 05:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
05:26:22.730 --> 05:26:22.740 align:start position:0%
before I discuss further I would I would
 
05:26:24.610 --> 05:26:24.620 align:start position:0%
like to
 
05:26:29.090 --> 05:26:29.100 align:start position:0%
say that 250 000 would be added for the
 
05:26:30.650 --> 05:26:30.660 align:start position:0%
Carolyn Stratford Freight rail
 
05:26:34.970 --> 05:26:34.980 align:start position:0%
improvements and 500 000 for the koas
 
05:26:38.330 --> 05:26:38.340 align:start position:0%
county Freight rail improvements
 
05:26:43.010 --> 05:26:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:43.020 --> 05:26:45.350 align:start position:0%
 
that

05:26:45.350 --> 05:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:26:45.360 --> 05:26:47.470 align:start position:0%
that
um

05:26:47.470 --> 05:26:47.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:50.690 --> 05:26:50.700 align:start position:0%
in my opinion if you think of what's
 
05:26:54.708 --> 05:26:54.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:56.810 --> 05:26:56.820 align:start position:0%
moments here in our country and rail
 
05:26:59.030 --> 05:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
derailments and so forth
 
05:27:01.910 --> 05:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
I think it's extremely important to keep
 
05:27:05.448 --> 05:27:05.458 align:start position:0%
up with the rails they talked about from
 
05:27:07.628 --> 05:27:07.638 align:start position:0%
going from segmented
 
05:27:12.288 --> 05:27:12.298 align:start position:0%
sections of rail to continuous weld the
 
05:27:15.890 --> 05:27:15.900 align:start position:0%
number of ties that can be replaced we
 
05:27:18.230 --> 05:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
had in in our budget earlier talking
 
05:27:21.050 --> 05:27:21.060 align:start position:0%
about so many million dollars for those
 
05:27:22.970 --> 05:27:22.980 align:start position:0%
improvements but that doesn't get them
 
05:27:26.330 --> 05:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
close to where they are so we have we
 
05:27:29.868 --> 05:27:29.878 align:start position:0%
have always been supportive of this and
 
05:27:32.990 --> 05:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
I would like to suggest that we expend
 
05:27:33.000 --> 05:27:34.670 align:start position:0%
I would like to suggest that we expend
750

05:27:34.670 --> 05:27:34.680 align:start position:0%
750
 
05:27:34.680 --> 05:27:36.590 align:start position:0%
750
000

05:27:36.590 --> 05:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
000
 
05:27:36.600 --> 05:27:37.490 align:start position:0%
000
um

05:27:37.490 --> 05:27:37.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:40.310 --> 05:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
once again for this project
 
05:27:42.708 --> 05:27:42.718 align:start position:0%
represent below
 
05:27:44.690 --> 05:27:44.700 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm just trying to do the math
 
05:27:48.830 --> 05:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
so they're on lines 45 46 and 47 that
 
05:27:51.410 --> 05:27:51.420 align:start position:0%
adds up to about
 
05:27:54.110 --> 05:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
what about a million six so which is is
 
05:27:55.250 --> 05:27:55.260 align:start position:0%
that what you're referencing through
 
05:27:56.810 --> 05:27:56.820 align:start position:0%
those three lines or is this in addition
 
05:27:59.090 --> 05:27:59.100 align:start position:0%
to or I'm just trying to figure that out
 
05:28:00.890 --> 05:28:00.900 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry it's
 
05:28:03.788 --> 05:28:03.798 align:start position:0%
let me find out where it is
 
05:28:06.650 --> 05:28:06.660 align:start position:0%
it's House Bill 199 that the committee
 
05:28:09.050 --> 05:28:09.060 align:start position:0%
retained oh okay so this isn't this I'm
 
05:28:10.670 --> 05:28:10.680 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm just referencing this Edition
 
05:28:13.788 --> 05:28:13.798 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry so we yeah we we had the
 
05:28:16.368 --> 05:28:16.378 align:start position:0%
hearing for House Bill 199 and then we
 
05:28:17.690 --> 05:28:17.700 align:start position:0%
retained it
 
05:28:20.570 --> 05:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
okay and we didn't pass funds for it
 
05:28:23.030 --> 05:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
because we typically bring it in at this
 
05:28:24.708 --> 05:28:24.718 align:start position:0%
point into the capital budget
 
05:28:27.948 --> 05:28:27.958 align:start position:0%
representative Jack the lines 45 46 47
 
05:28:29.990 --> 05:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
are a Department of Transportation
 
05:28:32.030 --> 05:28:32.040 align:start position:0%
request that wasn't funded in the
 
05:28:34.550 --> 05:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
governor's budget that we typically do
 
05:28:36.050 --> 05:28:36.060 align:start position:0%
fund some money
 
05:28:39.650 --> 05:28:39.660 align:start position:0%
for these for these repairs uh the two
 
05:28:41.510 --> 05:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
the the item the amount we're talking
 
05:28:44.448 --> 05:28:44.458 align:start position:0%
about now is not on this sheet okay
 
05:28:46.250 --> 05:28:46.260 align:start position:0%
so there's no overlap on this it's just
 
05:28:48.530 --> 05:28:48.540 align:start position:0%
this is in addition to
 
05:28:50.448 --> 05:28:50.458 align:start position:0%
got it and dependent that they get the
 
05:28:53.270 --> 05:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
that they get the matching funds and
 
05:28:56.270 --> 05:28:56.280 align:start position:0%
they report back through
 
05:28:57.650 --> 05:28:57.660 align:start position:0%
long range

make sure that they not only receive the
 
05:29:12.350 --> 05:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
matching funds but what it is they're
 
05:29:14.330 --> 05:29:14.340 align:start position:0%
going to you know what they propose to
 
05:29:17.208 --> 05:29:17.218 align:start position:0%
do next so it has oversight from the
 
05:29:19.910 --> 05:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
time it's approved by the legislature
 
05:29:21.410 --> 05:29:21.420 align:start position:0%
and it goes out
 
05:29:24.050 --> 05:29:24.060 align:start position:0%
if you'd like Mr chair I can read The
 
05:29:27.350 --> 05:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
Narrative that would be added to this
 
05:29:27.360 --> 05:29:29.330 align:start position:0%
Narrative that would be added to this
please

05:29:29.330 --> 05:29:29.340 align:start position:0%
please
 
05:29:31.430 --> 05:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
um so in the last capital budget for the
 
05:29:32.990 --> 05:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
same type of project The Narrative was
 
05:29:35.448 --> 05:29:35.458 align:start position:0%
the sum appropriated in subparagraphs
 
05:29:37.788 --> 05:29:37.798 align:start position:0%
shall be matched to private funds of an
 
05:29:40.128 --> 05:29:40.138 align:start position:0%
equal amount for each project the
 
05:29:41.570 --> 05:29:41.580 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation shall
 
05:29:43.190 --> 05:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
report on the use of the appropriation
 
05:29:45.650 --> 05:29:45.660 align:start position:0%
and matching private funds for each
 
05:29:47.510 --> 05:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
project to the capital budget overview
 
05:29:50.570 --> 05:29:50.580 align:start position:0%
Committee in October and April for each
 
05:29:52.788 --> 05:29:52.798 align:start position:0%
year of the biennium so that's the
 
05:29:54.230 --> 05:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
oversight that the chairman was
 
05:29:54.240 --> 05:29:55.550 align:start position:0%
oversight that the chairman was
referencing

05:29:55.550 --> 05:29:55.560 align:start position:0%
referencing
 
05:29:57.050 --> 05:29:57.060 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:29:59.150 --> 05:29:59.160 align:start position:0%
represent include here okay thank you Mr
 
05:30:01.788 --> 05:30:01.798 align:start position:0%
chairman uh as a co-sponsor of House
 
05:30:04.610 --> 05:30:04.620 align:start position:0%
Bill 199 I'm in full agreement with what
 
05:30:08.208 --> 05:30:08.218 align:start position:0%
you're proposing here I just feel too uh
 
05:30:11.330 --> 05:30:11.340 align:start position:0%
sorry that one argument is to try to
 
05:30:13.730 --> 05:30:13.740 align:start position:0%
reduce the number of heavy trucks that
 
05:30:16.730 --> 05:30:16.740 align:start position:0%
use our road hauling this stuff and I
 
05:30:19.208 --> 05:30:19.218 align:start position:0%
think the more we invest in Freight rail
 
05:30:22.730 --> 05:30:22.740 align:start position:0%
uh the what we we do hopefully is reduce
 
05:30:25.368 --> 05:30:25.378 align:start position:0%
the wear and tear on our roads and I
 
05:30:27.170 --> 05:30:27.180 align:start position:0%
mean the heavy trucks they put wear and
 
05:30:28.430 --> 05:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
tear on our roads and we've had
 
05:30:30.350 --> 05:30:30.360 align:start position:0%
discussions just to talk about
 
05:30:32.090 --> 05:30:32.100 align:start position:0%
funding the highway fund I don't want to
 
05:30:33.650 --> 05:30:33.660 align:start position:0%
get into funding the highway fund today
 
05:30:37.010 --> 05:30:37.020 align:start position:0%
but I think this is one small way to
 
05:30:40.368 --> 05:30:40.378 align:start position:0%
reduce uh the wear and tear on our roads
 
05:30:42.470 --> 05:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
especially I think in kowas County
 
05:30:44.208 --> 05:30:44.218 align:start position:0%
Carroll and Stratford but it's also a
 
05:30:46.128 --> 05:30:46.138 align:start position:0%
Statewide issue so I would ask this
 
05:30:50.570 --> 05:30:50.580 align:start position:0%
committee to put this item in thank you
 
05:30:53.090 --> 05:30:53.100 align:start position:0%
yes representative Kaczynski
 
05:30:56.510 --> 05:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
I totally oppose spending one dollar
 
05:30:59.930 --> 05:30:59.940 align:start position:0%
for these private railroads
 
05:31:02.208 --> 05:31:02.218 align:start position:0%
they're private companies
 
05:31:05.208 --> 05:31:05.218 align:start position:0%
we're not we're not uh privy to getting
 
05:31:07.610 --> 05:31:07.620 align:start position:0%
any of their profits at the end of the
 
05:31:09.890 --> 05:31:09.900 align:start position:0%
year you know these people bought these
 
05:31:12.708 --> 05:31:12.718 align:start position:0%
railroads with the intent of using them
 
05:31:15.830 --> 05:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
from for themselves now this Stratford
 
05:31:18.288 --> 05:31:18.298 align:start position:0%
County Railroad when I looked into this
 
05:31:20.990 --> 05:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
the owner of this is Boston sand and
 
05:31:23.750 --> 05:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
gravel down in in Boston
 
05:31:27.170 --> 05:31:27.180 align:start position:0%
so they own RCP Aggregates and the
 
05:31:29.448 --> 05:31:29.458 align:start position:0%
primary purpose is to transport sand
 
05:31:32.270 --> 05:31:32.280 align:start position:0%
from Ossipee New Hampshire to Boston for
 
05:31:32.280 --> 05:31:33.590 align:start position:0%
from Ossipee New Hampshire to Boston for
cement

05:31:33.590 --> 05:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
cement
 
05:31:37.128 --> 05:31:37.138 align:start position:0%
it's a private transportation line in
 
05:31:39.948 --> 05:31:39.958 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard that they're saving
 
05:31:43.670 --> 05:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
loads of money from Trucking the sand
 
05:31:45.288 --> 05:31:45.298 align:start position:0%
the only other customer to have is
 
05:31:47.570 --> 05:31:47.580 align:start position:0%
Eastern Propane gets some propane on the
 
05:31:50.030 --> 05:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
way back now they received the grant a
 
05:31:52.250 --> 05:31:52.260 align:start position:0%
huge Federal grant of over four million
 
05:31:55.670 --> 05:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
dollars in 2014 and part of that they
 
05:31:58.250 --> 05:31:58.260 align:start position:0%
were supposed to be looking for more to
 
05:32:00.470 --> 05:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
increase the customer base
 
05:32:03.830 --> 05:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
so there's no more customers here
 
05:32:06.410 --> 05:32:06.420 align:start position:0%
so I don't know what are we trying to
 
05:32:09.170 --> 05:32:09.180 align:start position:0%
save a railroad line for what if there's
 
05:32:11.628 --> 05:32:11.638 align:start position:0%
world war three and we need to truck
 
05:32:13.788 --> 05:32:13.798 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what out of Ossipee or
 
05:32:17.150 --> 05:32:17.160 align:start position:0%
the North Country I really I don't know
 
05:32:18.890 --> 05:32:18.900 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
05:32:21.650 --> 05:32:21.660 align:start position:0%
this is a wealthy private business here
 
05:32:24.170 --> 05:32:24.180 align:start position:0%
the last I looked at the last budget
 
05:32:26.990 --> 05:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
they were over well over 100 million
 
05:32:29.150 --> 05:32:29.160 align:start position:0%
dollars in revenue and I think it's
 
05:32:32.170 --> 05:32:32.180 align:start position:0%
personally disgusting to hit up the
 
05:32:35.270 --> 05:32:35.280 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in New Hampshire to be paying
 
05:32:37.788 --> 05:32:37.798 align:start position:0%
for private businesses here I brought
 
05:32:40.670 --> 05:32:40.680 align:start position:0%
this up to several constituents
 
05:32:43.128 --> 05:32:43.138 align:start position:0%
and anybody there was not one person
 
05:32:44.868 --> 05:32:44.878 align:start position:0%
that agreed in fact they were they
 
05:32:46.610 --> 05:32:46.620 align:start position:0%
couldn't believe it that we were
 
05:32:49.850 --> 05:32:49.860 align:start position:0%
expending money to a private company
 
05:32:49.860 --> 05:32:51.830 align:start position:0%
expending money to a private company
and

05:32:51.830 --> 05:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:32:53.330 --> 05:32:53.340 align:start position:0%
I don't know what I could say you know
 
05:32:55.910 --> 05:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
years years ago people called them the
 
05:32:58.150 --> 05:32:58.160 align:start position:0%
robber barons the carnegies the the
 
05:33:00.590 --> 05:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
Rockefellers and yet I don't know what
 
05:33:03.350 --> 05:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
do you call a multi-millionaire that's
 
05:33:05.510 --> 05:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
that's looking to sap money from from
 
05:33:08.030 --> 05:33:08.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizens I mean maybe
 
05:33:10.910 --> 05:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
we've been doing it I I I just can't see
 
05:33:12.590 --> 05:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
why this is done
 
05:33:15.890 --> 05:33:15.900 align:start position:0%
okay you know for somebody who believes
 
05:33:17.990 --> 05:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
in small government and small spending
 
05:33:20.868 --> 05:33:20.878 align:start position:0%
representing constituents here with
 
05:33:22.730 --> 05:33:22.740 align:start position:0%
their hard-earned money and giving it to
 
05:33:26.270 --> 05:33:26.280 align:start position:0%
a private company even at CSX they're no
 
05:33:27.948 --> 05:33:27.958 align:start position:0%
they're no little player in the game
 
05:33:27.958 --> 05:33:28.970 align:start position:0%
they're no little player in the game
here

05:33:28.970 --> 05:33:28.980 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:33:30.530 --> 05:33:30.540 align:start position:0%
you know you got this line goes from
 
05:33:34.010 --> 05:33:34.020 align:start position:0%
Quebec to Vermont and New Hampshire and
 
05:33:36.368 --> 05:33:36.378 align:start position:0%
Maine these people aren't going to stop
 
05:33:38.570 --> 05:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
transporting things if we don't give
 
05:33:41.350 --> 05:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
them this this money here
 
05:33:44.390 --> 05:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
that outfit the Boston sand and gravel
 
05:33:46.250 --> 05:33:46.260 align:start position:0%
you know I challenge them well okay
 
05:33:47.690 --> 05:33:47.700 align:start position:0%
they're gonna we're gonna shut it down
 
05:33:50.868 --> 05:33:50.878 align:start position:0%
maybe get some permits for for sand in
 
05:33:53.150 --> 05:33:53.160 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts to open up some new pits
 
05:33:56.570 --> 05:33:56.580 align:start position:0%
down here and transport into Boston I'm
 
05:33:59.330 --> 05:33:59.340 align:start position:0%
sure this is a lot more
 
05:34:01.310 --> 05:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
profitable forum
 
05:34:02.990 --> 05:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
to do this thank you thank you
 
05:34:05.390 --> 05:34:05.400 align:start position:0%
representative uh just like to point out
 
05:34:07.250 --> 05:34:07.260 align:start position:0%
that the um
 
05:34:10.750 --> 05:34:10.760 align:start position:0%
that the state of New Hampshire owns the
 
05:34:13.208 --> 05:34:13.218 align:start position:0%
owns the land
 
05:34:16.250 --> 05:34:16.260 align:start position:0%
unless of course passenger rail were to
 
05:34:20.230 --> 05:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
come back the the rail right-of-way here
 
05:34:23.750 --> 05:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
this money is for the Improvement of the
 
05:34:25.910 --> 05:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
ties and rails and you and I are never
 
05:34:28.670 --> 05:34:28.680 align:start position:0%
going to agree on this point and I
 
05:34:31.128 --> 05:34:31.138 align:start position:0%
certainly understand your passion and I
 
05:34:33.970 --> 05:34:33.980 align:start position:0%
certainly respect that but
 
05:34:38.090 --> 05:34:38.100 align:start position:0%
the representative cloutier's point of
 
05:34:40.970 --> 05:34:40.980 align:start position:0%
the number and I believe it's in the
 
05:34:43.550 --> 05:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of trucks that are
 
05:34:46.490 --> 05:34:46.500 align:start position:0%
saved from driving up and down here and
 
05:34:48.288 --> 05:34:48.298 align:start position:0%
I would profess that we're not saving
 
05:34:51.530 --> 05:34:51.540 align:start position:0%
them money we're saving wear and tear on
 
05:34:54.708 --> 05:34:54.718 align:start position:0%
our roads and passengers in the amount
 
05:34:57.948 --> 05:34:57.958 align:start position:0%
of traffic that's generated by that do
 
05:35:01.850 --> 05:35:01.860 align:start position:0%
we have further discussion
 
05:35:04.550 --> 05:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
a quick rebuttal
 
05:35:07.190 --> 05:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
on that that truck traffic
 
05:35:09.230 --> 05:35:09.240 align:start position:0%
if you figured a five day week that
 
05:35:12.530 --> 05:35:12.540 align:start position:0%
comes to about 560 trucks a day and if
 
05:35:14.690 --> 05:35:14.700 align:start position:0%
you sat at the Hampton tolls I think
 
05:35:17.628 --> 05:35:17.638 align:start position:0%
you'd find it's a drop in the bucket
 
05:35:22.490 --> 05:35:22.500 align:start position:0%
thank you sir uh represent Faulkner the
 
05:35:24.708 --> 05:35:24.718 align:start position:0%
idea that we are
 
05:35:26.868 --> 05:35:26.878 align:start position:0%
have public infrastructure that benefits
 
05:35:29.208 --> 05:35:29.218 align:start position:0%
private companies uh it happens all over
 
05:35:30.650 --> 05:35:30.660 align:start position:0%
the place we put
 
05:35:34.550 --> 05:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
money into airports that that have pet
 
05:35:37.730 --> 05:35:37.740 align:start position:0%
Airlines and private plane owners we put
 
05:35:40.250 --> 05:35:40.260 align:start position:0%
money into the highways that benefit
 
05:35:42.530 --> 05:35:42.540 align:start position:0%
truckers and vehicle owners I think that
 
05:35:44.868 --> 05:35:44.878 align:start position:0%
uh the model is such that we need to
 
05:35:47.448 --> 05:35:47.458 align:start position:0%
evaluate the public benefit but that the
 
05:35:49.970 --> 05:35:49.980 align:start position:0%
idea that
 
05:35:52.910 --> 05:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
we have private users is is just common
 
05:35:55.190 --> 05:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
because that's that's what we do thank
 
05:35:56.030 --> 05:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
you sir
 
05:35:58.128 --> 05:35:58.138 align:start position:0%
uh further further
 
05:36:00.650 --> 05:36:00.660 align:start position:0%
yeah could you clarify uh you said that
 
05:36:02.750 --> 05:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
the state owns all the right-of-ways of
 
05:36:05.628 --> 05:36:05.638 align:start position:0%
the railroads or is that this this right
 
05:36:08.150 --> 05:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
of way we do
 
05:36:11.810 --> 05:36:11.820 align:start position:0%
the road bed well how then
 
05:36:15.288 --> 05:36:15.298 align:start position:0%
only when this railroad stops ceases the
 
05:36:17.690 --> 05:36:17.700 align:start position:0%
goal then it goes back to the homeowners
 
05:36:20.510 --> 05:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
or the landowners if if it was
 
05:36:22.810 --> 05:36:22.820 align:start position:0%
determined that um
 
05:36:26.810 --> 05:36:26.820 align:start position:0%
passenger rail were to come back to the
 
05:36:26.820 --> 05:36:28.310 align:start position:0%
passenger rail were to come back to the
state

05:36:28.310 --> 05:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:36:30.470 --> 05:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
um it would be one of the rights of
 
05:36:33.230 --> 05:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
reversion reverting back to their
 
05:36:33.240 --> 05:36:34.250 align:start position:0%
reversion reverting back to their
ownership

05:36:34.250 --> 05:36:34.260 align:start position:0%
ownership
 
05:36:37.128 --> 05:36:37.138 align:start position:0%
represent Parker we have a state law
 
05:36:38.510 --> 05:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
since uh
 
05:36:41.030 --> 05:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
late 60s I think that any
 
05:36:43.550 --> 05:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
any version the railroads if they own it
 
05:36:46.490 --> 05:36:46.500 align:start position:0%
they what they own is a set of Rights
 
05:36:49.610 --> 05:36:49.620 align:start position:0%
basically you know virtually all the
 
05:36:52.010 --> 05:36:52.020 align:start position:0%
rights in the land but if they cease to
 
05:36:54.230 --> 05:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
operate a railroad or don't pass it on
 
05:36:56.090 --> 05:36:56.100 align:start position:0%
to somebody who's operating a railroad
 
05:36:57.948 --> 05:36:57.958 align:start position:0%
it now comes back to the state rather
 
05:37:01.250 --> 05:37:01.260 align:start position:0%
than to the um to the Buddy landowners
 
05:37:03.470 --> 05:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
by a statue we passed several decades
 
05:37:07.128 --> 05:37:07.138 align:start position:0%
ago and we did pay a fee to the railroad
 
05:37:09.110 --> 05:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
for the rights of that of that
 
05:37:09.120 --> 05:37:10.430 align:start position:0%
for the rights of that of that
right-of-way

05:37:10.430 --> 05:37:10.440 align:start position:0%
right-of-way
 
05:37:12.410 --> 05:37:12.420 align:start position:0%
but there are restrictions of when it
 
05:37:16.010 --> 05:37:16.020 align:start position:0%
could revert back if uh for you know
 
05:37:17.750 --> 05:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
so that we would have to give it back
 
05:37:20.990 --> 05:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
further question representative just
 
05:37:24.490 --> 05:37:24.500 align:start position:0%
briefly um along with the right-of-way
 
05:37:28.150 --> 05:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
and the proposed Rail and uh tie
 
05:37:30.830 --> 05:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
Replacements we own the culverts as well
 
05:37:32.570 --> 05:37:32.580 align:start position:0%
correct and if the cover is not
 
05:37:34.670 --> 05:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
maintained there could be issues
 
05:37:37.730 --> 05:37:37.740 align:start position:0%
further about with drainage beyond
 
05:37:41.150 --> 05:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
beyond the railroad beyond the railroad
 
05:37:43.310 --> 05:37:43.320 align:start position:0%
right away you were correct on that
 
05:37:45.670 --> 05:37:45.680 align:start position:0%

05:39:21.470 --> 05:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
misspelling here so
 
05:39:23.570 --> 05:39:23.580 align:start position:0%
I believe I believe this was one of
 
05:39:25.368 --> 05:39:25.378 align:start position:0%
their highest priorities
 
05:39:28.490 --> 05:39:28.500 align:start position:0%
it was and I believe that these chillers
 
05:39:32.150 --> 05:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
are at Hazen Drive the DS building if I
 
05:39:38.390 --> 05:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:42.230 --> 05:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not the person to ask that
 
05:39:42.240 --> 05:39:46.448 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not the person to ask that
um

05:39:46.448 --> 05:39:46.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:49.670 --> 05:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
it looks like a massive cone up there I
 
05:39:51.110 --> 05:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
can tell you I'm in the building all the
 
05:39:51.120 --> 05:39:51.830 align:start position:0%
can tell you I'm in the building all the
time

05:39:51.830 --> 05:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:39:53.628 --> 05:39:53.638 align:start position:0%
so this was one of their highest
 
05:39:56.690 --> 05:39:56.700 align:start position:0%
priorities uh we have an off we have
 
05:39:58.670 --> 05:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
several departments are in that building
 
05:40:02.208 --> 05:40:02.218 align:start position:0%
and I think this was uh a well needed
 
05:40:04.970 --> 05:40:04.980 align:start position:0%
item at three hundred thousand dollars
 
05:40:07.730 --> 05:40:07.740 align:start position:0%
I'd like to add that I believe these are
 
05:40:10.570 --> 05:40:10.580 align:start position:0%
the items I had listed here
 
05:40:14.150 --> 05:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
and if you move on this item at least
 
05:40:17.448 --> 05:40:17.458 align:start position:0%
for consideration at this time we still
 
05:40:22.570 --> 05:40:22.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:26.930 --> 05:40:26.940 align:start position:0%
7566 remaining by my or some number
 
05:40:30.948 --> 05:40:30.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:34.550 --> 05:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
you'd have about 1.7 million
 
05:40:36.590 --> 05:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
that would be the number still
 
05:40:39.530 --> 05:40:39.540 align:start position:0%
one one million seven hundred fifty
 
05:40:42.110 --> 05:40:42.120 align:start position:0%
seven thousand five hundred and sixty
 
05:40:44.570 --> 05:40:44.580 align:start position:0%
six dollars yeah
 
05:40:47.890 --> 05:40:47.900 align:start position:0%
spelling and math were not my uh
 
05:40:50.510 --> 05:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh discussion
 
05:40:53.990 --> 05:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
yes representative Abbott
 
05:40:56.708 --> 05:40:56.718 align:start position:0%
yes I think that um
 
05:40:59.628 --> 05:40:59.638 align:start position:0%
I don't know how far we could go with
 
05:41:02.810 --> 05:41:02.820 align:start position:0%
that but with the
 
05:41:06.890 --> 05:41:06.900 align:start position:0%
um money we have left and is
 
05:41:10.850 --> 05:41:10.860 align:start position:0%
which former chairman Graham brought up
 
05:41:13.550 --> 05:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
there's some attention that have to be
 
05:41:17.030 --> 05:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
given to planning for the new Men's
 
05:41:17.040 --> 05:41:19.490 align:start position:0%
given to planning for the new Men's
prison

05:41:19.490 --> 05:41:19.500 align:start position:0%
prison
 
05:41:21.890 --> 05:41:21.900 align:start position:0%
my my understanding
 
05:41:25.310 --> 05:41:25.320 align:start position:0%
on the the governor's request was
 
05:41:28.490 --> 05:41:28.500 align:start position:0%
50 million dollars to be set aside
 
05:41:32.990 --> 05:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
the finance has in my understanding
 
05:41:35.750 --> 05:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
has reduced that request to 10 million
 
05:41:37.430 --> 05:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
dollars at this time
 
05:41:40.250 --> 05:41:40.260 align:start position:0%
the 10 million dollars is the number
 
05:41:42.050 --> 05:41:42.060 align:start position:0%
that they believe
 
05:41:44.448 --> 05:41:44.458 align:start position:0%
will will give them the engineering the
 
05:41:47.330 --> 05:41:47.340 align:start position:0%
planning for what they want to do
 
05:41:47.340 --> 05:41:48.970 align:start position:0%
planning for what they want to do
so

05:41:48.970 --> 05:41:48.980 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:41:53.510 --> 05:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
in my understanding is that it was to
 
05:41:56.330 --> 05:41:56.340 align:start position:0%
set aside 40 million dollars as sort of
 
05:41:58.010 --> 05:41:58.020 align:start position:0%
like Capital Improvement
 
05:42:00.410 --> 05:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
and they would hoping that they would do
 
05:42:02.690 --> 05:42:02.700 align:start position:0%
that first for one or two years or
 
05:42:04.310 --> 05:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
whatever and then have to bond the
 
05:42:04.320 --> 05:42:05.510 align:start position:0%
whatever and then have to bond the
balance

05:42:05.510 --> 05:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
balance
 
05:42:10.788 --> 05:42:10.798 align:start position:0%
Finance I understand when the revised
 
05:42:10.798 --> 05:42:12.530 align:start position:0%
Finance I understand when the revised
um

05:42:12.530 --> 05:42:12.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:42:14.868 --> 05:42:14.878 align:start position:0%
when the revised numbers came in saw
 
05:42:17.330 --> 05:42:17.340 align:start position:0%
that they there could be as much as uh
 
05:42:20.628 --> 05:42:20.638 align:start position:0%
30 to a 60 million dollar shortfall in
 
05:42:23.030 --> 05:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
the revenue projections when they did
 
05:42:26.030 --> 05:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
the latest round and I'm speaking out of
 
05:42:27.850 --> 05:42:27.860 align:start position:0%
term this is what I understand
 
05:42:31.250 --> 05:42:31.260 align:start position:0%
that they figured at this point in time
 
05:42:33.890 --> 05:42:33.900 align:start position:0%
that they would remove 40 million from
 
05:42:37.190 --> 05:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
that and put the 10 million dollars in
 
05:42:39.770 --> 05:42:39.780 align:start position:0%
which would be what we've done similarly
 
05:42:42.470 --> 05:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
many times here saying you have a
 
05:42:44.470 --> 05:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
project that you can't build right away
 
05:42:48.050 --> 05:42:48.060 align:start position:0%
so we set aside the money for uh for the
 
05:42:51.610 --> 05:42:51.620 align:start position:0%
planning purpose that's my understanding
 
05:42:51.620 --> 05:42:53.448 align:start position:0%
planning purpose that's my understanding
so

05:42:53.448 --> 05:42:53.458 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:42:56.990 --> 05:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
um we are we also if if we move forward
 
05:43:00.050 --> 05:43:00.060 align:start position:0%
with this we still have that balance and
 
05:43:03.830 --> 05:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
we still have the seven million dollars
 
05:43:07.250 --> 05:43:07.260 align:start position:0%
plus that the CTE
 
05:43:10.128 --> 05:43:10.138 align:start position:0%
um money for win a Squam in the event
 
05:43:13.070 --> 05:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
that that doesn't move forward uh that
 
05:43:14.570 --> 05:43:14.580 align:start position:0%
we could give some guidance for
 
05:43:17.868 --> 05:43:17.878 align:start position:0%
repurpose but I unfortunately we just
 
05:43:19.610 --> 05:43:19.620 align:start position:0%
don't have that sort of money in our
 
05:43:19.620 --> 05:43:21.948 align:start position:0%
don't have that sort of money in our
budget

05:43:21.948 --> 05:43:21.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:25.550 --> 05:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
oh yes so so before we so the two
 
05:43:28.850 --> 05:43:28.860 align:start position:0%
chillers at Hazen drive at
 
05:43:30.708 --> 05:43:30.718 align:start position:0%
um three hundred thousand dollars
 
05:43:35.868 --> 05:43:35.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:41.090 --> 05:43:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:45.048 --> 05:43:45.058 align:start position:0%
so yes represent Jack thank you if in
 
05:43:46.610 --> 05:43:46.620 align:start position:0%
fact we have somewhere in the area of
 
05:43:49.310 --> 05:43:49.320 align:start position:0%
1.7 million left that would do nicely to
 
05:44:03.548 --> 05:44:03.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:05.570 --> 05:44:05.580 align:start position:0%
which is
 
05:44:09.048 --> 05:44:09.058 align:start position:0%
which is the dot requested uh railroad
 
05:44:11.868 --> 05:44:11.878 align:start position:0%
line items that
 
05:44:14.810 --> 05:44:14.820 align:start position:0%
are are in my mind pretty important to
 
05:44:17.448 --> 05:44:17.458 align:start position:0%
keep those in good repair I'm sorry I'm
 
05:44:19.368 --> 05:44:19.378 align:start position:0%
not on the right line with you yet on
 
05:44:22.850 --> 05:44:22.860 align:start position:0%
the agency request 45 46 and 47 under
 
05:44:26.390 --> 05:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
dot it's the railroad repairs that
 
05:44:34.090 --> 05:44:34.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:34.100 --> 05:44:36.490 align:start position:0%
 
1.6

05:44:36.490 --> 05:44:36.500 align:start position:0%
1.6
 
05:44:40.250 --> 05:44:40.260 align:start position:0%
plus or minus yeah
 
05:44:41.990 --> 05:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
does everyone understand the
 
05:44:44.030 --> 05:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
representatives request
 
05:44:46.670 --> 05:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
represent Mills Mr chair I just want to
 
05:44:49.070 --> 05:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
bring up as much as I love doing that
 
05:44:52.250 --> 05:44:52.260 align:start position:0%
kind of repair and I certainly agree uh
 
05:44:54.948 --> 05:44:54.958 align:start position:0%
I'd want to remind everybody that week
 
05:44:58.430 --> 05:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
put 1.5 million into the Community
 
05:44:58.440 --> 05:44:59.750 align:start position:0%
put 1.5 million into the Community
College

05:44:59.750 --> 05:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
College
 
05:45:01.730 --> 05:45:01.740 align:start position:0%
thinking that we could come back and
 
05:45:04.070 --> 05:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about that too we
 
05:45:05.810 --> 05:45:05.820 align:start position:0%
still haven't decided what we were going
 
05:45:09.470 --> 05:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
to recommend that 1.5 if we move forward
 
05:45:11.628 --> 05:45:11.638 align:start position:0%
with this
 
05:45:14.330 --> 05:45:14.340 align:start position:0%
we've just about taken care of the money
 
05:45:16.250 --> 05:45:16.260 align:start position:0%
that we've got right now just thought
 
05:45:18.230 --> 05:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
I'd bring it up thank you
 
05:45:18.240 --> 05:45:20.270 align:start position:0%
I'd bring it up thank you
representative

05:45:20.270 --> 05:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:45:22.970 --> 05:45:22.980 align:start position:0%
yes Under The Heading of just thinking
 
05:45:25.490 --> 05:45:25.500 align:start position:0%
I'll bring this up too does anybody else
 
05:45:28.548 --> 05:45:28.558 align:start position:0%
remember that when D.O.T was in here I
 
05:45:28.558 --> 05:45:29.628 align:start position:0%
remember that when D.O.T was in here I
think

05:45:29.628 --> 05:45:29.638 align:start position:0%
think
 
05:45:31.070 --> 05:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
when they were
 
05:45:33.170 --> 05:45:33.180 align:start position:0%
when they were speaking I bet he
 
05:45:35.530 --> 05:45:35.540 align:start position:0%
mentioned five or six or seven times
 
05:45:38.390 --> 05:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
about five items that they really wanted
 
05:45:40.670 --> 05:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
and that just didn't make the governor's
 
05:45:43.610 --> 05:45:43.620 align:start position:0%
list doesn't I mean there were several
 
05:45:43.620 --> 05:45:44.990 align:start position:0%
list doesn't I mean there were several
things

05:45:44.990 --> 05:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
things
 
05:45:45.000 --> 05:45:45.590 align:start position:0%
things
um

05:45:45.590 --> 05:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:49.010 --> 05:45:49.020 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation there well
 
05:45:51.708 --> 05:45:51.718 align:start position:0%
there were listings on here of the
 
05:45:54.470 --> 05:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
projects that they wanted yeah
 
05:45:57.410 --> 05:45:57.420 align:start position:0%
um but unfortunately to fund those items
 
05:46:00.650 --> 05:46:00.660 align:start position:0%
it comes out of the highway fund
 
05:46:04.788 --> 05:46:04.798 align:start position:0%
and if when we've had serious as there's
 
05:46:08.390 --> 05:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
there's a need and a want but if we
 
05:46:11.030 --> 05:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
those funds would come out of that and
 
05:46:13.070 --> 05:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
we would have less money to pave and
 
05:46:15.410 --> 05:46:15.420 align:start position:0%
build Bridges
 
05:46:18.770 --> 05:46:18.780 align:start position:0%
and so we we've we've steered clear of
 
05:46:20.390 --> 05:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
that in the past all right thank you
 
05:46:22.070 --> 05:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for that I'm hoping our
 
05:46:23.510 --> 05:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
president can come up with that money
 
05:46:25.970 --> 05:46:25.980 align:start position:0%
yeah and all in all honesty Federal
 
05:46:29.090 --> 05:46:29.100 align:start position:0%
appropriation yes representative yes so
 
05:46:31.490 --> 05:46:31.500 align:start position:0%
where are these lines located in these
 
05:46:31.500 --> 05:46:34.250 align:start position:0%
where are these lines located in these
Bridges

05:46:34.250 --> 05:46:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:36.830 --> 05:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
or the suggestion that representative
 
05:46:38.390 --> 05:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
Jack I thought that's what you're
 
05:46:40.368 --> 05:46:40.378 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
05:46:43.610 --> 05:46:43.620 align:start position:0%
I I don't know the answer to that
 
05:46:45.650 --> 05:46:45.660 align:start position:0%
I I suggest we're getting a little long
 
05:46:48.830 --> 05:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
on on a long day
 
05:46:52.010 --> 05:46:52.020 align:start position:0%
um and I have a commitment in my town at
 
05:46:55.010 --> 05:46:55.020 align:start position:0%
six o'clock I mean we just went through
 
05:46:56.650 --> 05:46:56.660 align:start position:0%
a bunch of money here
 
05:47:00.890 --> 05:47:00.900 align:start position:0%
yeah so um why don't I'm gonna I'm gonna
 
05:47:03.890 --> 05:47:03.900 align:start position:0%
suggest that I think there's Merit in
 
05:47:05.810 --> 05:47:05.820 align:start position:0%
that request I think there's Merit in
 
05:47:09.170 --> 05:47:09.180 align:start position:0%
more money for the Community College
 
05:47:12.830 --> 05:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
um and we would I suggest we come back
 
05:47:16.010 --> 05:47:16.020 align:start position:0%
on Friday and try and thrash through the
 
05:47:17.750 --> 05:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
remainder of that and what we should
 
05:47:20.690 --> 05:47:20.700 align:start position:0%
would like to prioritize the money for
 
05:47:23.628 --> 05:47:23.638 align:start position:0%
the CT project in the event
 
05:47:26.510 --> 05:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
um that project doesn't move forward
 
05:47:28.430 --> 05:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
I'm open for discussion for the next few
 
05:47:31.310 --> 05:47:31.320 align:start position:0%
minutes yes representative Newman could
 
05:47:33.410 --> 05:47:33.420 align:start position:0%
I just get clarification when a Squam
 
05:47:36.708 --> 05:47:36.718 align:start position:0%
was going to vote on did you say Friday
 
05:47:41.570 --> 05:47:41.580 align:start position:0%
the 27th 27th of this month
 
05:47:43.970 --> 05:47:43.980 align:start position:0%
is our intent that we're going to pass
 
05:47:46.368 --> 05:47:46.378 align:start position:0%
this out of here out of committee ahead
 
05:47:50.448 --> 05:47:50.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:53.810 --> 05:47:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:53.820 --> 05:47:54.770 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:47:54.770 --> 05:47:54.780 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:47:56.510 --> 05:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
I think we've done tremendous amount of
 
05:47:58.128 --> 05:47:58.138 align:start position:0%
work again
 
05:47:58.138 --> 05:47:59.090 align:start position:0%
work again
yeah

05:47:59.090 --> 05:47:59.100 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:48:00.910 --> 05:48:00.920 align:start position:0%
so um yeah
 
05:48:04.548 --> 05:48:04.558 align:start position:0%
so Friday Friday it looks like we could
 
05:48:07.670 --> 05:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
be in a point that um we'll work on the
 
05:48:09.530 --> 05:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
balance of that
 
05:48:11.690 --> 05:48:11.700 align:start position:0%
um we're still scheduled for Monday so
 
05:48:13.368 --> 05:48:13.378 align:start position:0%
we'll put we'll we're gonna have to have
 
05:48:15.110 --> 05:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
time to write amendments and so forth
 
05:48:15.120 --> 05:48:16.010 align:start position:0%
time to write amendments and so forth
but

05:48:16.010 --> 05:48:16.020 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:48:17.510 --> 05:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
correct it's going to take a little bit
 
05:48:19.190 --> 05:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
of time to to make the amendment
 
05:48:21.350 --> 05:48:21.360 align:start position:0%
together pull the amendment together so
 
05:48:23.690 --> 05:48:23.700 align:start position:0%
depending how quickly decisions are made
 
05:48:25.570 --> 05:48:25.580 align:start position:0%
I'll give you a better sense on Friday
 
05:48:27.770 --> 05:48:27.780 align:start position:0%
when I think we can have an amendment to
 
05:48:29.628 --> 05:48:29.638 align:start position:0%
I think your exec on Mondays scheduled
 
05:48:31.850 --> 05:48:31.860 align:start position:0%
for 11 and you're you have a work
 
05:48:33.948 --> 05:48:33.958 align:start position:0%
session at 10 o'clock in case you had
 
05:48:38.390 --> 05:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:38.400 --> 05:48:40.270 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:48:40.270 --> 05:48:40.280 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:48:42.890 --> 05:48:42.900 align:start position:0%
Friday at 10 o'clock
 
05:48:46.128 --> 05:48:46.138 align:start position:0%
yeah and Mondays at 10 another work
 
05:48:48.590 --> 05:48:48.600 align:start position:0%
session and then at 11 is a exact
 
05:48:55.368 --> 05:48:55.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:57.650 --> 05:48:57.660 align:start position:0%
do you have a plan when you would do the
 
05:49:03.470 --> 05:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:03.480 --> 05:49:04.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:49:04.430 --> 05:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:49:07.070 --> 05:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
no I hadn't really done a full thought
 
05:49:08.930 --> 05:49:08.940 align:start position:0%
on that
 
05:49:11.448 --> 05:49:11.458 align:start position:0%
what I was
 
05:49:13.548 --> 05:49:13.558 align:start position:0%
possibly going to try to do is start the
 
05:49:16.190 --> 05:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
amendment with OLS
 
05:49:18.770 --> 05:49:18.780 align:start position:0%
because you've done so much today to see
 
05:49:20.990 --> 05:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
if I can get a draft Amendment for you
 
05:49:22.548 --> 05:49:22.558 align:start position:0%
on Friday
 
05:49:25.490 --> 05:49:25.500 align:start position:0%
that you then it'll be less work to
 
05:49:27.470 --> 05:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
change that if you have to add or delete
 
05:49:31.368 --> 05:49:31.378 align:start position:0%
something or change something it would
 
05:49:33.350 --> 05:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
be less to do that
 
05:49:35.090 --> 05:49:35.100 align:start position:0%
represent Mills
 
05:49:37.730 --> 05:49:37.740 align:start position:0%
would it help if we if that 1.5 million
 
05:49:40.070 --> 05:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
that we've so far committed to the
 
05:49:41.930 --> 05:49:41.940 align:start position:0%
community colleges would it help if we
 
05:49:44.030 --> 05:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
had a fast straw poll here and decided
 
05:49:46.010 --> 05:49:46.020 align:start position:0%
whether we wanted it that to go to
 
05:49:48.470 --> 05:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
critical maintenance or
 
05:49:48.480 --> 05:49:49.128 align:start position:0%
critical maintenance or
um

05:49:49.128 --> 05:49:49.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:49:51.830 --> 05:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
the respiratory for the purposes of
 
05:49:55.970 --> 05:49:55.980 align:start position:0%
doing the amendment it would yes okay I
 
05:49:57.770 --> 05:49:57.780 align:start position:0%
okay we're dragging you back for one
 
05:49:57.780 --> 05:49:58.970 align:start position:0%
okay we're dragging you back for one
more

05:49:58.970 --> 05:49:58.980 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:50:01.548 --> 05:50:01.558 align:start position:0%
so the discussion is
 
05:50:04.610 --> 05:50:04.620 align:start position:0%
um on the 1.5 million dollars
 
05:50:07.010 --> 05:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of getting the amendment
 
05:50:07.020 --> 05:50:08.350 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of getting the amendment
drafted

05:50:08.350 --> 05:50:08.360 align:start position:0%
drafted
 
05:50:10.510 --> 05:50:10.520 align:start position:0%
a straw poll
 
05:50:13.490 --> 05:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
by the committee of whether you would
 
05:50:16.970 --> 05:50:16.980 align:start position:0%
like to have that money purposed for the
 
05:50:19.548 --> 05:50:19.558 align:start position:0%
respiratory program or whether you would
 
05:50:21.788 --> 05:50:21.798 align:start position:0%
rather have it done for
 
05:50:24.708 --> 05:50:24.718 align:start position:0%
critical maintenance at this point in
 
05:50:24.718 --> 05:50:25.548 align:start position:0%
critical maintenance at this point in
time

05:50:25.548 --> 05:50:25.558 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:50:27.530 --> 05:50:27.540 align:start position:0%
keeping in mind we still have time to
 
05:50:28.850 --> 05:50:28.860 align:start position:0%
revisit this
 
05:50:32.510 --> 05:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
so let's start with if you're in favor
 
05:50:36.470 --> 05:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
of the 1.5 million being purposed for
 
05:50:38.830 --> 05:50:38.840 align:start position:0%
the respiratory program
 
05:50:41.930 --> 05:50:41.940 align:start position:0%
signified by raising your hand strop
 
05:50:41.940 --> 05:50:48.350 align:start position:0%
signified by raising your hand strop
hole

05:50:48.350 --> 05:50:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:51.770 --> 05:50:51.780 align:start position:0%
six members
 
05:50:55.310 --> 05:50:55.320 align:start position:0%
and if you're in favor of instead of
 
05:50:58.128 --> 05:50:58.138 align:start position:0%
repurposing that for or excuse expending
 
05:51:00.890 --> 05:51:00.900 align:start position:0%
that 1.5 for critical maintenance raise
 
05:51:05.390 --> 05:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:09.470 --> 05:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
six seven eight as I count it yeah
 
05:51:13.030 --> 05:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:16.190 --> 05:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
you were Which Way represent below I'm
 
05:51:19.070 --> 05:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
just so the next thing we just say
 
05:51:21.590 --> 05:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
I mean if we try to split the money it
 
05:51:23.270 --> 05:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't make it it doesn't help either
 
05:51:24.770 --> 05:51:24.780 align:start position:0%
way right I mean basically that's
 
05:51:26.270 --> 05:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
undermine so it's either going to be 1.5
 
05:51:29.868 --> 05:51:29.878 align:start position:0%
or for one or the other yeah got it okay
 
05:51:31.190 --> 05:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
so it would appear the committee
 
05:51:33.590 --> 05:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
recommendation and for those that are
 
05:51:36.048 --> 05:51:36.058 align:start position:0%
interested in critical needs we have we
 
05:51:38.690 --> 05:51:38.700 align:start position:0%
have availability to go back there and
 
05:51:41.270 --> 05:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
add money back for that infrastructure
 
05:51:42.890 --> 05:51:42.900 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:51:45.350 --> 05:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
with that Chris anything else we can do
 
05:51:46.548 --> 05:51:46.558 align:start position:0%
to help
 
05:51:48.890 --> 05:51:48.900 align:start position:0%
no I I think I have enough to to get
 
05:51:51.948 --> 05:51:51.958 align:start position:0%
started with um I'll update the compare
 
05:51:54.110 --> 05:51:54.120 align:start position:0%
sheet to go with your straw polls today
 
05:51:57.470 --> 05:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
so you'll have a an easy cheat sheet and
 
05:51:58.850 --> 05:51:58.860 align:start position:0%
then and I'll try to get the amendment
 
05:52:00.110 --> 05:52:00.120 align:start position:0%
started and hopefully have a draft
 
05:52:00.120 --> 05:52:01.250 align:start position:0%
started and hopefully have a draft
Amendment

05:52:01.250 --> 05:52:01.260 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
05:52:04.070 --> 05:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
um of the entire Bill possibly on Friday
 
05:52:06.470 --> 05:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
represent Mills yeah I just want this uh

to thank Mr Shea and be happiness
 
05:52:11.448 --> 05:52:11.458 align:start position:0%
committee because without these cheat
 
05:52:14.448 --> 05:52:14.458 align:start position:0%
sheets you have no idea of how long a
 
05:52:17.750 --> 05:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
process this is and trying to balance
 
05:52:19.730 --> 05:52:19.740 align:start position:0%
between seven or eight different Bibles
 
05:52:22.430 --> 05:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
and books and things so thank you Mr
 
05:52:24.350 --> 05:52:24.360 align:start position:0%
Shear I would concur with representative
 
05:52:26.948 --> 05:52:26.958 align:start position:0%
Mills on that
 
05:52:29.930 --> 05:52:29.940 align:start position:0%
